<p>On appeal, by the Crown, of the order of Justice James Chadwick staying the 
  proceedings on an indictment dated March 1, 2001.</p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] A trial of eight counts of sexual abuse alleged to have been committed by 
  the respondent Jacques Leduc, a Cornwall lawyer, was stayed on the ground of 
  wilful non-disclosure by a senior crown prosecutor. The principal issue on this 
  Crown appeal is whether the finding of wilful non-disclosure is supported by 
  the evidence. In my view it is not. I have not found any evidence in the record 
  to sustain this finding. I would, therefore, set aside the stay and order a 
  new trial.</p>
<p>
  B. OVERVIEW</p>
<p>
  [2] Leduc was charged with sexually abusing three teenaged boys. The charges 
  resulted from &quot;Project Truth,&quot; an Ontario Provincial Police (&quot;OPP&quot;) 
  investigation into allegations of widespread sexual abuse by prominent members 
  of the Cornwall community. Ms Shelley Hallett, a senior Crown counsel, was assigned 
  to prosecute the Leduc case. </p>
<p>
  [3] During the trial, Mrs. M., the mother of one of the complainants, testified 
  that she had had two telephone conversations with Perry Dunlop, an ex-Cornwall 
  police officer. Dunlop had been the first officer to try to expose sexual abuse 
  in the Cornwall area. The OPP were concerned that in his zealousness to do so, 
  he may have tainted the evidence of witnesses in Project Truth cases. </p>
<p>
  [4] Mrs. M.'s evidence took Ms. Hallett and counsel for Leduc by surprise. Although 
  the conversations between Dunlop and Mrs. M. were referred to in Dunlop's notes 
  and will say statement, and in the notebook of an OPP officer, these materials 
  had not been disclosed to Leduc. And although Ms. Hallett had received Dunlop's 
  materials to make disclosure in another Project Truth case, she said that she 
  had not seen the references to Dunlop's telephone conversations with Mrs. M. 
  After Mrs. M. testified, Ms. Hallett gave copies of these materials to Leduc. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] Nonetheless, Leduc brought an application to stay the charges against him 
  on the ground of wilful non-disclosure. On the first day of the application, 
  the trial judge McKinnon J. recused himself for possible bias. With the agreement 
  of counsel, Chadwick J. heard the application. </p>
<p>
  [6] Leduc initially contended that the police deliberately withheld Dunlop's 
  materials and the officer's notes. During the stay application, however, Leduc 
  obtained from a Project Truth investigator and produced a copy of a letter Ms. 
  Hallett had written the investigator on July 4, 2000. The letter stated that 
  she intended to review the Dunlop materials later that month in connection with 
  another Project Truth case. Armed with this letter, Leduc claimed that Ms. Hallett, 
  not the police, had deliberately withheld Dunlop's materials. </p>
<p>
  [7] On March 1, 2001, after a three-day hearing, the application judge gave 
  an oral decision. He found that Ms. Hallett had wilfully failed to disclose 
  Dunlop's materials to prevent him from contaminating the prosecution. He also 
  concluded that Leduc's right to a fair trial within a reasonable time had been 
  irreparably prejudiced. He therefore stayed the charges. And he ordered that 
  the Crown pay Leduc's costs of the trial and of the application. </p>
<p>
  [8] The Crown appeals. The Ontario Crown Attorneys' Association and the Criminal 
  Lawyers' Association were granted leave to intervene on the question of the 
  appropriate notice of an allegation of Crown misconduct. The appeal raises these 
  issues: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Did the application judge have jurisdiction to hear the 
  application?</p>
<p class="indent">2. (a) Did Crown counsel receive reasonable notice of the allegation 
  against her? </p>
<p class="indent">(b) Should the court propound a special rule for notice to Crown 
  counsel of an allegation of wilful non-disclosure?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Did the application judge err in finding that Crown counsel 
  wilfully failed to disclose Dunlop's materials and her July 4, 2000 letter?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Did the application judge err in granting a stay of proceedings?</p>
<p class="indent">5. Did the application judge err in awarding costs against the 
  Crown?</p>
<p>
  C. BAGKGROUND FACTS</p>
<p>
  [9] The stay application turned mainly on whether Ms. Hallett intentionally 
  did not disclose information about the two telephone calls between the mother 
  of one of the complainants and Dunlop. The respondent contended that Ms. Hallett 
  deliberately withheld disclosure of this information because, in the words of 
  the application judge, she &quot;did not want the portal to open to make Dunlop's 
  evidence relevant to the Leduc case&quot;.</p>
<p>
  (a) Perry Dunlop and Project Truth</p>
<p>
  [10] Perry Dunlop was a constable with the Cornwall Police Service. Counsel 
  for Leduc labelled him a &quot;rogue police officer&quot; and a &quot;witness 
  contaminator&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [11] In the mid-1990s, Dunlop set out to expose what he believed was a massive 
  conspiracy among high-ranking members of the community. According to Dunlop, 
  the conspiracy was aimed at preventing the public from finding out about a ring 
  of pedophiles operating in the Cornwall area. Dunlop alleged that members of 
  the Cornwall Police Service, the Crown Attorney's Office and the Catholic Church 
  had paid off a complainant and had collaborated to cover up sexual abuse. Leduc 
  was counsel to the Catholic diocese. He thus became a target of Dunlop's allegations.</p>
<p>
  [12] In 1997, Dunlop gave to the London Chief of Police a number of witness 
  statements that alleged sexual abuse by prominent members of the Cornwall community. 
  Significantly, none of these statements alleged that Leduc had committed sexual 
  abuse. The statements were turned over to the OPP. In July 1997, the OPP established 
  Project Truth to investigate the sexual abuse allegations.</p>
<p>
  [13] The Project Truth team interviewed approximately 850 people. Dunlop had 
  no official role in the investigation. Nonetheless, he maintained an interest 
  in Project Truth, and managed, without authorization, to inject himself into 
  the OPP investigation. The Project Truth investigators soon became concerned 
  that Dunlop was interviewing both witnesses and complainants and trying to colour 
  their evidence. They viewed him as a potential obstacle to successful prosecutions, 
  and made numerous attempts - mostly unsuccessful - to stop him from contacting 
  complainants or witnesses in any Project Truth inquiry.</p>
<p>
  [14] The investigators also repeatedly asked Dunlop to surrender all his notes 
  and to produce a detailed history in the form of a will say statement recounting 
  his involvement in Project Truth matters. At a meeting on July 23, 1998, Dunlop 
  was told to turn over his notes as they were needed for inclusion in disclosure 
  briefs for defence counsel on a number of Project Truth cases. He refused to 
  comply. Not until the spring of 2000 did Dunlop hand over to the investigators 
  his notes, a will say statement and other materials. As I will discuss, two 
  items in his notes and in his will say statement precipitated the stay application.</p>
<p>
  [15] In the fall of 2000, Dunlop resigned from the Cornwall Police Service and 
  moved to British Columbia. He did not testify on the stay application.</p>
<p>
  (b) The charges against Leduc</p>
<p>
  [16] The Project Truth investigation let to sexual abuse charges against fifteen 
  Cornwall residents. One of those charged was Leduc. Of the fifteen accused, 
  some had been identified earlier as sexual abusers by Dunlop. However, Leduc 
  was not among this group. A friend of the family of one of the complainants 
  first identified Leduc to the police. </p>
<p> [17] Leduc was eventually committed for trial before a judge alone on eight 
  counts of sexual abuse against three complainants. The bare details of his arrest 
  and pre-trial procedures are as follows:</p>
<p>
  [18] On May 7, 1998, the first of the three complainants, Cory M., together 
  with his mother, went to the OPP and alleged that Leduc had sexually abused 
  him. On June 22, 1998, Leduc was arrested and charged with six sexual offences. 
  On July 17, 1998, a replacement information alleged twelve counts against two 
  complainants, Cory M. and Shawn P. That month Ms. Hallett was assigned to prosecute 
  the case.</p>
<p>
  [19] In March 1999, just before his preliminary inquiry was to begin, Leduc 
  was re-arrested and charged with additional sexual offences against a third 
  complainant, Stuart L. The information now contained sixteen charges of sexual 
  abuse against three complainants.</p>
<p>
  [20] From October 1998 onward, Leduc's counsel had made ongoing requests for 
  disclosure and had complained about incomplete disclosure. Indeed, Dunlop's 
  will say statement records that Leduc's lawyer was &quot;screaming for disclosure&quot;. 
  In response to these requests and complaints, in the spring of 1999, Ms. Hallett 
  gave the defence several volumes of additional disclosure. These additional 
  materials prompted Leduc's counsel to ask for an adjournment to review the new 
  disclosure. The adjournment was granted.</p>
<p>
  [21] In November 1999, Leduc elected to be tried by judge and jury. On December 
  2, 1999, after a six-day preliminary inquiry, Leduc was committed for trial 
  on thirteen of the sixteen counts. At the hearing Dunlop was not called as a 
  witness. None of the three complainants was questioned about any contact with 
  Dunlop or about any influence Dunlop may have exerted over each's decision to 
  press charges.</p>
<p>
  [22] On March 31, 2000, the court fixed a trial date of January 15, 2001. Earlier 
  dates were available but Leduc's counsel was not. Leduc waived his rights under 
  s. 11(b) of the Charter to an earlier trial. </p>
<p>
  [23] On January 11, 2001, four days before the trial was to begin, the Crown 
  decided to proceed on a new indictment containing only eight counts: six counts 
  of sexual exploitation, one count of sexual interference and one count of offering 
  sexual services for consideration. Leduc re-elected to be tried by a judge alone 
  because he was concerned about finding a fair and impartial jury. </p>
<p>
  (c) The trial before McKinnon J.</p>
<p>
  (i) The position of the Crown and the defence</p>
<p>
  [24] On January 17, 2001, Leduc was arraigned before McKinnon J. and pleaded 
  not guilty to all eight counts. The Crown's case was based on the evidence of 
  the three complainants and one similar fact witness. Leduc's defence rested 
  on the theory that the complaints were fabricated and the product of collusion. 
  Leduc maintained that both fabrication and collusion were live issues when the 
  stay application was heard.</p>
<p>
  [25] Before that application brought the trial to a halt, McKinnon J. heard 
  the evidence of two of the complainants: Shawn P. and Cory M., and the evidence 
  of sixteen supporting witnesses. The application judge heard none of this evidence.</p>
<p>
  [26] Shawn P. testified that he started doing yard work and other chores for 
  Leduc in 1995 when he was fifteen years old. He gave evidence that the respondent 
  fondled his penis, that they masturbated each other and that they engaged in 
  anal penetration - in all eight incidents between the fall of 1997 and January 
  1998.</p>
<p>
  [27] Cory M. testified that he did chores for Leduc for about seven years, from 
  1989, when he was twelve years old, until 1996, when he was nineteen. He gave 
  evidence of numerous incidents of sexual activity with Leduc, especially in 
  the years 1991 to 1992. He said that these incidents included fondling of genitals, 
  oral sex, masturbation and anal sex. The incidents took place at Leduc's home, 
  at his cottage, at his law office and even at a Toronto hotel.</p>
<p>
  (ii) The testimony of Cory M.'s mother</p>
<p>
  [28] On February 7, 2001, the mother of Cory M. testified. She was the eighth 
  witness for the Crown. During her cross-examination she gave some unexpected 
  evidence: she said that she had spoken twice by telephone with Perry Dunlop. 
  She had been trying to get some counselling for her son, and a woman at the 
  welfare office gave her Dunlop's name. Mrs. M. telephoned him. Dunlop offered 
  &quot;to talk to Cory if Cory was willing, that he had gone through all this 
  before and that he could help him, maybe, you know, deal with it&quot;. Dunlop 
  also gave her some advice about suing the respondent. He said that the &quot;better 
  way to hurt the accused, is by suing them for everything they have.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [29] Sometime later, by coincidence, when Detective Constable Dupuis, one of 
  the Project Truth investigators, was at her home, Mrs. M. received a telephone 
  call from Dunlop. He simply asked, &quot;How is Cory dealing with it, is he 
  okay-&quot;</p>
<p>
  [30] These two telephone calls were the only contacts between the mother of 
  Cory M. and Dunlop. Moreover, Mrs. M. testified that she &quot;definitely&quot; 
  never spoke to a Crown attorney about her conversations with Dunlop. Equally 
  significant, although Dunlop offered to speak to Cory M. if he was willing to 
  do so, apparently Cory M. was not willing. The two never spoke to each other.</p>
<p>
  [31] After Mrs. M.'s evidence and before the stay application was heard, the 
  Crown called ten more witnesses.</p>
<p>
  (iii) The undisclosed information in Dunlop's materials and Dupuis's notebook</p>
<p>
  [32] Both Ms. Hallett and counsel for Leduc said that Mrs. M.'s evidence took 
  them by surprise. Ms. Hallett told the trial judge that she had not been aware 
  of any contact between Perry Dunlop and a potential witness in the case against 
  the respondent. She instructed Detective Constable Dupuis to review his notes 
  to see when and where the contact with Dunlop occurred. On February 12, 2001, 
  the defence wrote to the Crown asking for &quot;complete disclosure about the 
  role of Perry Dunlop and matters surrounding the Project Truth investigation&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [33] The following day, February 13, 2001, the Crown gave the defence three 
  things: Perry Dunlop's personal handwritten notes, which were 184 pages long; 
  Dunlop's typed will say statement, which, with appendices, was 430 pages; and 
  a five-line entry dated June 15, 1998, in Dupuis' notebook.</p>
<p>
  [34] Dunlop's notes contained two brief entries on which the respondent relied: 
  a May 8, 1998 entry recording his first telephone call with Cory M.'s mother; 
  and a July 23, 1998 entry recording a discussion about the call with a Project 
  Truth investigator. In the May 8th entry, Dunlop wrote that the mother of Cory 
  M. had called him and told him that her son &quot;was sexually assaulted by 
  J. Leduc from the time he was 12 to 17 yrs. Has gone to OPP&quot;. In the July 
  23rd entry, Dunlop wrote that Detective Inspector Smith asked why he had called 
  Cory M.'s mother and he answered &quot;only to ask, check on her son&quot;. 
  In his will say statement Dunlop reproduced his two handwritten entries, the 
  second in a slightly expanded form: </p>
<p class="indent"> 8th May 1998 - B.M. calls my home, to state that her son Cory 
  was sexually assaulted by Jacques Leduc when he was 12-17. I told her to go 
  to O.P.P. - Project Truth states that has already been done.</p>
<p class="indent">23rd July 1998 - 15:10 Hrs. 10-19 (Attend station) Cst. Sauve 
  advise me at the station to see Inspector Wells. Attend Wells office, he advises 
  to go see Inspector Trew. I attend Inspector Trew's office. Present are Inspector 
  Trew, Inspector Tim Smith and Det. Sergeant Pat Hall. Inspector Tim Smith inquires 
  about my wife's comment to the press: &quot;Every parent should be knocking 
  down the O.P.P.'s door demanding to know who these pedophiles are.&quot; Wants 
  to know about certain issues my wife has brought up. I indicated that maybe 
  he should ask her.</p>
<p class="indent">Inspector Tim Smith tells me he won't be intimidated by the 
  media, lawyers or public pressure. I told him that I won't be intimidated either. 
  He stated that it makes it hard for victims to come forward if they had no confidence. 
  Indicates that victims will not come forward if this continues.</p>
<p class="indent">Inspector Tim Smith wants to know about B. M. I stated that 
  I spoke to her and directed her to Project Truth. Inspector Tim Smith indicated 
  that I called her back. Three weeks later I called B. M. back out of concern 
  she was very upset the first time she called me. Out of concern that a normal 
  caring person has I called her back to make sure she was O.K.</p>
<p class="indent">Detective Sergeant Pat Hall indicates that there may be a problem 
  with where statements were taken. Indicates that Neville and Edilson, lawyers 
  for the accused Charles MacDonald and Jacques Leduc are screaming for disclosure.</p>
<p>
  [35] Dunlop's notes and will say statement also contained two other references 
  to Leduc. Dunlop wrote that on March 30, 1997, he saw Leduc and a senior Crown 
  attorney having lunch; and he wrote that on July 11, 1997, Inspector Smith said 
  that Leduc &quot;had no involvement&quot; in settling a civil case against the 
  Catholic Church. Neither of these references seems even marginally relevant 
  to the prosecution of the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [36] The June 15, 1998 entry from Dupuis' notebook refers to the second telephone 
  call between Dunlop and Cory M.'s mother: </p>
<p class="indent">
  10:54 Picked up Project Guardian tape from the M.s. Mrs. M. stated that she 
  had received [back] a call from Perry Dunlop. Wanting to know how the investigation 
  was proceeding.</p>
<p>
  [37] None of these pieces of information disclosed to the defence on February 
  13, 2001, had been included in the disclosure brief prepared by the police and 
  given both to the Crown and the defence before the trial started. When those 
  briefs were prepared, the police did not yet have Dunlop's notes or his will 
  say statement. They did, however, have Dupuis' notebook. As Dupuis later testified, 
  he simply overlooked the June 15th entry.</p>
<p>
  D. THE STAY APPLICATION</p>
<p>
  (a) The submissions of counsel on February 14, 2001: the defence's intent to 
  bring a stay application and Crown counsel's explanation for the late disclosure</p>
<p>
  [38] On February 14, 2001, after the Crown had given the defence the additional 
  disclosure, both counsel addressed the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [39] Counsel for Leduc said that he intended to move to stay the prosecution 
  of his client. He contended that the police deliberately did not disclose Dunlop's 
  connection to Cory M.'s mother to prevent Dunlop from contaminating the prosecution 
  of the respondent. He did not suggest misconduct by the Crown. Instead he said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Based upon our review, we intend to bring a motion to stay the proceedings before 
  this court, pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. In addition, we will be seeking 
  costs pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. The basis of our motion will be in 
  brief, deliberate non-disclosure by one of the officers in charge of this case, 
  Detective Constable Dupuis and several senior ranking police officers in the 
  Project Truth investigation. It will be the position of the defence on the motion, 
  that these officers colluded and conspired to suppress all information in their 
  possession relating to Perry Dunlop's participation in this case.</p>
<p>
  [40] Later in his submissions, after referring to the contact between Dunlop 
  and Cory M., counsel for Leduc observed that the defence &quot;are not satisfied 
  that there wasn't other connection or contact with Mr. Dunlop and other complainants 
  in this matter.&quot; However, the evidence called on the stay application disclosed 
  no other connection or contact.</p>
<p>
  [41] Ms. Hallett responded at length to the defence's position. In her submissions 
  to the trial judge she essentially made four points. First, she accepted responsibility 
  for the late disclosure. Even the respondent acknowledged that this was the 
  honourable thing to do. </p>
<p>
  [42] Second, she stated clearly that she previously had no knowledge of any 
  connection between Dunlop and the criminal charges against Leduc. Thus, for 
  example, when dealing with the entry in Dupuis' notebook she said to the Court: </p>
<p class="indent">
  However, naturally, the memo book entry and the fact that Constable Dupuis was 
  there, at the time apparently, that this call from Constable Dunlop came through, 
  was of such a nature as to cause dismay for me because, of course, this is the 
  porthole through which the ghost of Constable Dunlop can now infiltrate this 
  case and these proceedings, Your Honour. And I frankly had not ever anticipated 
  that a defence in this case would be based on any connection that Constable 
  Dunlop had with this case because I have honestly believed, all the way through, 
  that there absolutely was no connection.</p>
<p>
  [43] Third, Ms. Hallett stated that she had received Dunlop's personal notes 
  and will say statement in the spring of 2000, and had reviewed them in &quot;a 
  cursory way&quot;. She then explained why she did not perceive that the Dunlop 
  material should be disclosed to the respondent: </p>
<p class="indent">
  As I say, Your Honour, it was not my understanding that there was any, any contact 
  by Constable Dunlop and any witness or victim in the Leduc matter and I did 
  not perceive these items from Constable Dunlop to be relevant to the issue of 
  disclosure to generate any disclosure obligation on my part. And, as I say, 
  this judgment of mine was based on the preliminary inquiry that had already 
  been conducted by that time and my knowledge of the ages and backgrounds of 
  the various complainants in this matter and the fact that they didn't know each 
  other. And also the fact that I didn't know about this call that Ms. M. had 
  placed to Constable Dunlop.</p>
<p>
  [44] And fourth, Ms. Hallett acknowledged that Dunlop had spoken to victims 
  and witnesses in other cases. One of those other cases was the prosecution of 
  Father Charles MacDonald, for which Ms. Hallett was also responsible. Knowing 
  of Dunlop's connection to the MacDonald case, she had &quot;ensured that there 
  would be disclosure of anything relating to Constable Dunlop to defence counsel 
  . . . for Father MacDonald&quot;. She reiterated that although she had disclosed 
  the Dunlop materials to counsel for MacDonald, she had not seen any connection 
  between those materials and Leduc: </p>
<p class="indent">
  As I say, I perused these documents in a cursory way to satisfy myself, essentially, 
  that they should be disclosed to defence counsel for Father MacDonald. However, 
  because of my unawareness of any connection between Constable Dunlop and the 
  witnesses for the Leduc matter, I did not pour over each document to see whether 
  there was anything that would be relevant to Mr. Leduc's defence. And I take 
  responsibility for that, however, as I say, by that point in time, we had had 
  the preliminary inquiry.</p>
<p>
  [45] Against the backdrop of these submissions the respondent launched his stay 
  application.</p>
<p>
  (b) Leduc's Notice of Application</p>
<p>
  [46] Whether Ms. Hallett received fair notice of the allegation of deliberate 
  non-disclosure is an issue in this appeal. </p>
<p>
  [47] On February 15, 2001 Leduc gave the Crown written notice of his application, 
  which was to be heard on February 19, 2001. He sought a stay of the proceedings 
  against him under s. 24(1) of the Charter. In his notice, Leduc alleged that 
  &quot;information about Perry Dunlop's contact with [Mrs. M.] and the subsequent 
  investigation of it, was deliberately not disclosed to counsel for the Applicant 
  despite the awareness of the police that it was sought by counsel and of potential 
  significance to the defence&quot;. Leduc made no allegation of non-disclosure 
  against Ms. Hallett.</p>
<p>
  (c) McKinnon J. recuses himself</p>
<p>
  [48] The first witness on the stay application questioned the trial judge's 
  impartiality. The witness pointed out that while a member of the Bar the trial 
  judge had previously acted for the Cornwall Police Service. The trial judge 
  adjourned the application and reviewed the Police Service's files to discover 
  whether the witness's concern had any merit. The trial judge discovered that 
  he had drafted a discipline charge against Dunlop in connection with the investigation 
  of allegations of sexual abuse against a priest, who was later charged with 
  sexual offences by Project Truth. The trial judge concluded that this previous 
  retainer would give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias should he hear 
  the stay application. On February 20, 2001, he decided to recuse himself. Neither 
  counsel disagreed with his decision.</p>
<p>
  [49] In deciding not to hear the application, the trial judge made this significant 
  observation: </p>
<p class="indent">
  As I have stated numerous times in this case, this particular case and others 
  that accompany it have riveted the community. Perhaps there is no more important 
  case that requires that justice be seen to be done than this series of cases, 
  these cases including the case against Jacques Leduc.</p>
<p>
  [50] The trial judge arranged for Chadwick J. to hear the stay application. 
  Although in this court the Crown contended that Chadwick J. had no jurisdiction 
  to hear the application, Ms. Hallett did not take that position. Indeed, she 
  expressly agreed with the trial judge's decision to have another judge hear 
  the application. She did, however, submit that, should the stay application 
  be dismissed, McKinnon J. could not continue as the trial judge because he 
  would not be perceived to be impartial as long as Perry Dunlop was a factor 
  in the case. McKinnon J. did not rule on this submission. He said only, &quot;Well 
  this may or may not be premature, I don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>
  (d) The proceedings before Chadwick J.</p>
<p>
  [51] The stay application before Chadwick J. began on February 21, 2001. I will 
  deal with the evidence and submissions on the application in more detail when 
  I discuss the issues on the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [52] Evidence was called over three days, February 21, 22 and 26. Four Project 
  Truth investigators testified, including Inspector Hall, Detective Constable 
  Dupuis and Constable Genier. The defence put in evidence a letter dated July 
  4, 2000 (Exhibit 22) from Ms. Hallett to Dupuis, in which she said that she 
  would be reviewing the Dunlop materials for the purpose of disclosure in the 
  Father MacDonald case. Leduc relied on this letter and the circumstances of 
  its disclosure in support of his application.</p>
<p>
  [53] All three complainants testified. Each said that he had had no contact 
  with Perry Dunlop and had not been influenced by him. Leduc did not challenge 
  this evidence or lead evidence to rebut it.</p>
<p>
  [54] In their oral submissions the two counsel for the defence changed the focus 
  of their application from wilful non-disclosure by the police to wilful non-disclosure 
  by Ms. Hallett. In her submissions, Ms. Hallett again explained that her failure 
  to disclose was inadvertent, not intentional. She did not testify.</p>
<p>
  (e) The application judge's ruling</p>
<p>
  [55] The application judge found that the Dunlop materials were relevant to 
  the prosecution of Leduc and should have been disclosed. And he found that &quot;the 
  failure to disclose by the Crown was wilful&quot;. He concluded that &quot;the 
  holding back of the July 2000 letter and the Dunlop notes and will say statement, 
  which had been reviewed in depth by the Crown, showed that the Crown did not 
  want the portal to open to make Dunlop's evidence relevant to the Leduc case.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [56] The application judge then turned to the appropriate remedy. He said that 
  his &quot;initial reaction was to declare a mistrial and to make a substantial 
  order of costs against the Crown.&quot; He concluded, however, that the only 
  appropriate remedy was a stay. In his view, &quot;Jacques Leduc's right to a 
  fair trial within a reasonable period of time has been irreparably prejudiced 
  and the only remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter is a stay of proceedings.&quot;</p>
<p>
  E. ANALYSIS OF THE ISSUES ON THE APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [57] The Crown's principal position on appeal is that neither the finding of 
  wilful non-disclosure, nor the order of the stay, is supportable on the evidence. 
  The Crown also advances two other submissions: the application judge had no 
  jurisdiction to hear the application for a stay and Ms. Hallett did not receive 
  reasonable notice of the allegation of wilful non-disclosure made against her. 
  Because, logically, these two submissions precede the Crown's main position, 
  I shall deal with them first.</p>
<p>
  1. Did the Application Judge have Jurisdiction to Hear the Application?</p>
<p>
  [58] When McKinnon J. perceived that his presiding over the stay application 
  would give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, he arranged for Chadwick 
  J. to hear the application. The Crown consented to this arrangement. Nonetheless, 
  in this court the Crown submits that McKinnon J. should have simply declared 
  a mistrial, either because he had no jurisdiction to transfer the stay application 
  to Chadwick J., or because, as a practical matter, once Dunlop became an issue 
  in the trial he could no longer carry on as the trial judge even if the stay 
  were refused. I shall deal with these points separately.</p>
<p>
  [59] The Crown contends that McKinnon J. had no jurisdiction to bifurcate the 
  proceedings by severing the stay application from the trial proper and appointing 
  another judge to preside over the &quot;severed off&quot; proceeding. It points 
  out, correctly, that consent cannot confer jurisdiction. It therefore submits 
  that once McKinnon J. concluded that he could not continue to hear the stay 
  application, his jurisdiction ended and he should have declared a mistrial. 
  Equally, Chadwick J. ought to have declined jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  [60] The respondent argues that McKinnon J. had jurisdiction to transfer the 
  stay application to Chadwick J. and that Chadwick J. had jurisdiction to hear 
  it. He puts forward two bases for this jurisdiction: the jurisdiction of a superior 
  court judge to grant relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter or s. 669.2(1) of 
  the Criminal Code. I agree that either basis supported the transfer of jurisdiction 
  over the stay from the trial judge to the application judge. </p>
<p>
  [61] Ordinarily, once a reasonable apprehension of bias has been demonstrated, 
  a trial judge has no jurisdiction to continue the proceedings. The only appropriate 
  remedy is a new trial. See R. v. Curragh Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 537.</p>
<p>
  [62] But McKinnon J was confronted with an unusual situation. The appearance 
  of bias had not yet infected the trial. It arose only on the stay application. 
  Thus, purely as a jurisdictional matter, I am not persuaded that McKinnon J. 
  had to declare a mistrial before the stay application. He was entitled to ask 
  another judge of his court to hear the stay application. His jurisdiction to 
  do so rested on the principle first stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in 
  Mills v. The Queen (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at p. 517 and reaffirmed 
  in its subsequent decision in Rahey v. The Queen (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 289 
  (S.C.C.) at 299: &quot;the constant, complete, and concurrent jurisdiction&quot; 
  of the Superior Court to grant relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  [63] In both Mills and Rahey the trial proceedings were in the provincial court. 
  Still the Supreme Court held that the Superior Court could exercise jurisdiction 
  over a Charter issue as long as it was more suited than the trial court to assess 
  and grant the appropriate remedy. In Rahey at p. 299, Lamer J. discussed when 
  this &quot;discretionary jurisdiction&quot; ought to be exercised: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In Mills, it was also decided that the superior courts should have &quot;constant, 
  complete and concurrent jurisdiction&quot; for s. 24(1) applications. But it 
  was therein emphasized that the superior courts should decline to exercise this 
  discretionary jurisdiction unless, in the opinion of the superior court and 
  given the nature of the violation or any other circumstances, it is more suited 
  than the trial court to assess and grant the remedy that is just and appropriate. 
  The clearest, though not necessarily the only, instances where there is a need 
  for the exercise of such jurisdiction are those where there is as yet no trial 
  court within reach and the timeliness of the remedy or the need to prevent a 
  continuing violation of rights is shown, and those where it is the process below 
  itself which is alleged to be in violation of the Charter's guarantees. The 
  burden should be upon the claimant, in this case Mr. Rahey, to establish that 
  the application is an appropriate one for the superior court's consideration.</p>
<p>
  [64] Here, the trial proceedings are in the Superior Court, not the provincial 
  court. But it seems to me that the principle in Mills and Rahey still applies. 
  The appearance of bias prevented the trial judge from hearing the stay application. 
  He could not guarantee a fair process. To prevent any further delay in the proceedings, 
  Chadwick J. had a discretionary jurisdiction to hear the stay application.</p>
<p>
  [65] Alternatively, I think that Chadwick J. also had jurisdiction under s. 
  669.2(1) of the Criminal Code. That section - with the applicable words underlined 
  - states: </p>
<p class="indent"> 669.2(1) Subject to this section, where an accused or a defendant 
  is being tried by </p>
<p class="indent">(a) a judge or provincial court judge,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) a justice or other person who is, or is a member of, a summary 
  conviction court, or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) a court composed of a judge and jury,</p>
<p class="indent">as the case may be, and the judge, provincial court judge, justice 
  or other person dies or is for any reason unable to continue, the proceedings 
  may be continued before another judge, provincial court judge, justice or other 
  person, as the case may be, who has jurisdiction to try the accused or defendant 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [66] The caselaw does not establish an exhaustive list of circumstances where 
  a judge would be &quot;unable to continue&quot;. The list, however, has been 
  held to include illness, absence and appointment to higher court. See Ramsey 
  v. The Queen (1972), 8 C.C.C. (2d) 188 (N.B.S.C.-App. Div.); R. v. Beauchamp, 
  [2002] J.Q. No. 3214 (Sup. Ct.); R. v. Shrubsall (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 425 
  (N.S. Sup. Ct.). The section uses the open-ended phrase &quot;for any reason&quot;. 
  In my view, the trial judge's disqualification for bias was a &quot;reason&quot; 
  within this section of the Code. The trial judge's conclusion that a reasonable 
  apprehension of bias arose on the stay application meant that he was unable 
  to continue to hear that application. No apprehension of bias arose before the 
  stay application, and thus the trial record remained untainted. Accordingly, 
  the stay proceedings could be continued before another judge of the same court.</p>
<p>
  [67] The Crown, however, also submits that transferring the hearing of the stay 
  application to Chadwick J. served no useful purpose. It argues that once Dunlop's 
  involvement became an issue in the respondent's case, McKinnon J. could not 
  have continued the trial even if the stay application were dismissed. Therefore, 
  the Crown contends, the trial judge should not have left open the possibility 
  that he could continue with the trial. He should have declared a mistrial, ordered 
  a new trial and left the respondent to pursue whatever Charter remedies he considered 
  appropriate.</p>
<p>
  [68] In hindsight, this submission appears to have considerable merit. Indeed, 
  in his reasons, Chadwick J. commented, &quot;Now that Dunlop is relevant to 
  the Leduc's case the trial judge in all likelihood would have to recuse himself 
  from the trial and declare a mistrial.&quot; In this court, both counsel concurred 
  that McKinnon J. could not continue to preside over the respondent's trial.</p>
<p>
  [69] In my view, however, the trial judge should not be faulted for the position 
  that he took. On their face the telephone calls between Cory M.'s mother and 
  Dunlop seemed innocuous, at most marginally relevant. The trial judge undoubtedly 
  was concerned about the cost, the delay and the inconvenience of a new trial. 
  He likely wanted to preserve the possibility, however slight, that Dunlop would 
  not be an issue in the trial itself and that, therefore, he could carry on as 
  the trial judge. Thus, he acted appropriately and within his jurisdiction in 
  asking another judge of the Superior Court to hear the stay application. For 
  these reasons I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  2. The Notice Issues</p>
<p>
  [70] The Crown submits that Ms. Hallett did not receive reasonable notice of 
  the allegation of wilful non-disclosure made against her. It argues that, absent 
  reasonable notice, the application judge should not have made a finding of misconduct. 
  </p>
<p>
  [71] The submissions of the intervenors, the Ontario Crown Attorney's Association 
  (&quot;OCAA&quot;) and the Criminal Lawyer's Association (&quot;CLA&quot;), 
  raised the more general question whether this court should propound a special 
  rule governing notice when a Crown counsel is alleged to have intentionally 
  withheld information relevant to the defence.</p>
<p>
  (a) Did Crown counsel receive reasonable notice of the allegation against her?</p>
<p>
  [72] An accused who applies for the stay of proceedings for a Charter violation 
  is obliged to give the Crown reasonable notice of the application and the grounds 
  for it. Therefore, if the application for a stay is based on prosecutorial misconduct, 
  the defence is obliged to give the Crown fair notice of that allegation. The 
  accused's obligation to give notice is codified in rule 27 of the Criminal Proceedings 
  Rules. Rule 27.03 requires a written notice of application and constitutional 
  issue, which includes the relief sought and the grounds to be argued. Under 
  rule 2.02, the court may dispense with requirements of rule 27, &quot;only where 
  and as necessary in the interests of justice&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [73] The obvious purpose of notice is to give the Crown a fair opportunity to 
  respond to the application. In this court, the Crown submits that the respondent 
  did not comply with his obligation to give reasonable notice. The Crown contends 
  that the notice given to Ms. Hallett was inadequate, that only in closing submissions 
  was she was told explicitly she was accused of prosecutorial misconduct and 
  that, therefore, she did not have a fair opportunity to respond. Because of 
  the lack of notice, the Crown submits that the stay and the finding of misconduct 
  on which it was based cannot stand.</p>
<p> [74] To put this submission in context I will briefly review the chronology 
  of what occurred.</p>
<ul>
  <li>February 7, 2001: Cory M.'s mother testifies about her telephone calls with 
    Dunlop.</li>
  <li>February 12: Leduc writes the Crown asking for disclosure of Dunlop's materials 
    and Dupuis' handwritten note.</li>
  <li>February 13 - 14: Ms. Hallett gives Leduc copies of the materials requested.</li>
  <li>February 14: Leduc gives oral notice of his intent to apply for a stay based 
    on police non-disclosure.</li>
  <li>February 15: Leduc serves a notice of application and constitutional issue, 
    seeking a stay under s. 24(1) the Charter based on deliberate non-disclosure 
    by the police.</li>
  <li>February 19: The stay application begins before McKinnon J.</li>
  <li>February 20: McKinnon J. recuses himself. Leduc obtains a copy of exhibit 
    22, Ms. Hallett's July 4, 2000 letter to Detective Constable Dupuis.</li>
  <li>Wednesday, February 21: The stay application begins before Chadwick J. Counsel 
    for Leduc states orally that he will not seek a stay unless the non-disclosure 
    was wilful. He contends, &quot;this is not a matter simply of five lines buried 
    in the notes of an investigating police officers. There are other materials 
    in the hands of the police and Crown counsel and which have been in the hands 
    of the police and Crown counsel for eight or nine months now.&quot;</li>
  <li>Thursday, February 22: The stay application continues for a second day and 
    then is adjourned to Monday February 26.</li>
  <li>Monday, February 26: The stay application concludes. During closing argument, 
    counsel for Leduc states expressly that he is seeking a stay because Ms. Hallett 
    &quot;wilfully withheld from the defence&quot; the Dunlop materials and exhibit 
    22.</li>
  <li>March 1: Chadwick J. orders a stay based on intentional non-disclosure by 
    Ms. Hallett.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [75] As this chronology demonstrates, notice that the stay application was grounded 
  on Ms. Hallett's misconduct was far from ideal. The written notice of application 
  and constitutional issue makes no allegation of misconduct against her. Although 
  counsel for Leduc gave some inkling of their client's position in opening submissions 
  to the application judge on February 21, not until closing arguments did they 
  clearly state that the application for a stay focused on the conduct of Ms. 
  Hallett, not that of the police.</p>
<p>
  [76] Counsel for Leduc did not amend the notice of application when they received 
  a copy of exhibit 22 on February 20. They did not even amend the notice of application 
  between the second and third days of the stay hearing, though they had four 
  days to do so. They did not send Ms. Hallett a letter indicating the changed 
  focus of the application. Even in opening submissions on February 21, they did 
  not expressly tell the court and the Crown that Ms. Hallett's conduct was now 
  the basis for the application. Had counsel for Leduc done any of these things, 
  Ms. Hallett might have better appreciated the gravity of the allegation against 
  the Crown. She might have better appreciated that her credibility was being 
  questioned. Instead, in the midst of a stressful and emotional trial, she had 
  to respond, with little notice, to a most serious allegation of misconduct.</p>
<p>
  [77] Still, Leduc's failure to take any of these steps does not answer the question 
  whether the notice of prosecutorial misconduct was so inadequate that for this 
  reason alone the stay should be set aside. I do not have to resolve this question 
  because I have concluded that the finding of Crown misconduct on which the stay 
  was based is not supported by the evidence. I do, however, lean to the view 
  that though not ideal, the notice was adequate. I also lean to the view that 
  the Crown should not be permitted to raise the adequacy of the notice on appeal. 
  I do so for three main reasons.</p>
<p>
  [78] First, from the beginning of the hearing of the stay application, Ms. Hallett 
  seemed aware of the allegation against her and prepared to respond to it. She 
  addressed the allegation not just in her closing submissions but in her questioning 
  of the police officers called on the stay. In answer to questions from Ms. Hallett, 
  Inspector Hall and Detective Constable Dupuis each said that to his knowledge 
  Crown counsel had not intentionally withheld material prejudicial to the prosecution.</p>
<p>
  [79] Second, and more important, Ms. Hallett did not object to the adequacy 
  of the notice she was given. At no time during the stay, even during closing 
  arguments when there could have been no doubt about Leduc's position, did Ms. 
  Hallett ask for an adjournment, ask for the opportunity to get advice from another 
  lawyer, or even say that the allegation had taken her by surprise. Although 
  her failure to object may not be fatal to the Crown's position on appeal, I 
  think it is an important consideration.</p>
<p>
  [80] Appellate courts are always reluctant to permit one party to raise on appeal 
  an issue that was not raised at trial. This reluctance is grounded in several 
  valid concerns: possible prejudice to the other party, who may not have had 
  a fair opportunity to respond to the issue; an incomplete trial record and the 
  absence of factual findings on the issue; and society's interest in the finality 
  of criminal litigation. See R. v. Brown, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 918 at 923. These concerns 
  existed in this case.</p>
<p>
  [81] Finally, whether notice is reasonable or adequate must be assessed in the 
  context in which it is given. Here Ms. Hallett participated in the stay hearing 
  without objection. She questioned police witnesses on her conduct. She made 
  detailed closing submissions explaining what had happened. She never once raised 
  the adequacy of the notice given to her. All these considerations weigh against 
  setting aside the stay because the Crown did not get reasonable notice of the 
  allegation of prosecutorial misconduct. I would not give effect to this ground 
  of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (b) Should the court propound a special rule for notice to Crown Counsel of 
  an allegation of wilful non-disclosure?</p>
<p>
  [82] The OCAA and the CLA were given leave to intervene to make submissions 
  on the appropriate notice to be given to a Crown counsel of an allegation of 
  wilful non-disclosure.</p>
<p>
  [83] The OCAA argues for a firm rule: where the defence alleges wilful non-disclosure, 
  Crown counsel must be given timely written notice of the allegation, with enough 
  particulars to permit the Crown to know the case to be met and a fair opportunity 
  to respond to it. The OCAA submits that such a rule is required by the principles 
  of natural justice and the duty of fairness. </p>
<p>
  [84] In making this submission, the OCAA draws an analogy to administrative 
  law proceedings, and especially to law society disciplinary proceedings. It 
  argues that both the importance of the issue and the potential effect of an 
  adverse finding warrant a high standard of natural justice. What is at stake 
  is whether a Crown counsel intentionally breached her constitutional disclosure 
  obligation under s. 7 of the Charter. A finding of intentional non-disclosure 
  will adversely affect Crown counsel's reputation, and may have serious professional, 
  criminal and employment consequences. The OCAA submits that these considerations 
  impose a duty at the high end of the scales of natural justice. It says that 
  its proposed rule is consistent with this duty. </p>
<p>
  [85] Further the OCAA submits that the respondent failed to give Ms. Hallett 
  the notice contemplated by its proposed rule. The notice to Ms. Hallett was 
  not timely; it was not in writing; and it did not specify what particulars were 
  being relied on to support the allegation of wilful non-disclosure.</p>
<p>
  [86] Where an accused intends to rely on an allegation of prosecutorial misconduct, 
  I think it highly desirable that Crown counsel receive the kind of notice argued 
  for by the OCAA. If the accused is represented by a lawyer, where at all possible, 
  this kind of notice is called for as a matter of simple professional decency 
  and courtesy.</p>
<p>
  [87] But, largely for the reasons given by the CLA, I do not consider it either 
  wise or necessary to impose the firm notice requirement suggested by the OCAA. 
  First, even in administrative law, the duty of procedural fairness, which includes 
  the duty to give adequate notice, ordinarily applies to parties to a proceeding. 
  In criminal proceedings, Crown counsel is not a party. A finding of prosecutorial 
  misconduct may affect Crown counsel, but criminal proceedings are between the 
  accused and the state. Only where Crown counsel's interests are directly affected 
  - for example, by a cost order against counsel personally - would the duty of 
  procedural fairness be applicable. See R. v. Richards (1999), 26 C.R. (5th) 
  286 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [88] Viewed in this light, the analogy to law society discipline proceedings 
  is not sound. In discipline proceedings the lawyer is a party, charged with 
  professional misconduct or conduct unbecoming. An adverse finding can result 
  in a reprimand, a suspension from practice, or even disbarment. Because of these 
  potentially serious consequences of finding of professional misconduct, courts 
  have consistently held that the lawyer is entitled to a high standard of natural 
  justice, which would include the kind of notice proposed by the OCAA. The duty 
  of procedural fairness, so clearly applicable to professional discipline proceedings, 
  cannot automatically be transposed to an application for a stay of a criminal 
  prosecution, even where the basis of the application is alleged Crown misconduct. 
  </p>
<p>
  [89] Second, and most important, the Crown and its counsel are already adequately 
  protected by the rules requiring notice of an application for relief under s. 
  24 of the Charter and by the trial judge's inherent jurisdiction to control 
  the court's processes. Indeed the rules for notice for Charter applications 
  are similar to the rule proposed by the OCAA.</p>
<p>
  [90] An allegation of wilful non-disclosure by Crown counsel typically leads 
  - as it did in this case - to an application for relief under s. 24(1) of the 
  Charter. As I have already said where the defence brings this application, rule 
  27.03 of the Criminal Proceedings Rules requires a written notice of application 
  and constitutional issue. This notice must specify the relief sought, the grounds 
  to be argued and the documentary evidence to be used at the hearing. Moreover, 
  the notice must be served fifteen days before the hearing of the application, 
  unless an order is obtained abridging the time. Rule 27.05 prescribes the materials 
  that are to accompany the notice. Similar rules exist for Charter applications 
  in the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
<p>
  [91] Thus, both the OCAA's proposed rule and the Criminal Proceedings Rules 
  require notice in writing; both require timely notice; and both require that 
  the relief and the grounds for it be specified. </p>
<p>
  [92] However, I see two differences. The OCAA's rule calls for spelling out 
  the particulars relied on; the Criminal Proceedings Rules do not require &quot;particulars&quot;. 
  The OCAA's rule would apply in all cases; the Criminal Proceedings Rules permit 
  the court under rule 2.01 to shorten time periods on &quot;terms as are just&quot; 
  or, under rule 2.02, to dispense altogether with the requirements of rule 27 
  &quot;where and as necessary in the interests of justice&quot;. In short the 
  OCAA proposes a firm rule applicable in all cases; the Criminal Proceedings 
  Rules allow for flexibility.</p>
<p>
  [93] It seems to me that maintaining this flexibility is necessary to protect 
  the accused's constitutional right to make full answer and defence. In some 
  cases it may be unfair to require the accused to identify in advance the reasons 
  for non-disclosure, whether the non-disclosure was intentional, and, if so, 
  the party responsible. It may be unfair because ordinarily the Crown is in the 
  best position to know the reasons why relevant information was withheld and 
  who withheld it. The law is clear that the Crown, not the defence, has the burden 
  of explaining non-disclosure. See R. v. Stinchcombe (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 1 
  at p. 12 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Ahluwalia (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 212-213 
  (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [94] Also, at any stage of a trial an accused has to be reasonably free to raise 
  any legitimate defence, even though doing so may adversely affect another person. 
  The accused's right is a constitutional one. The concerns of a Crown counsel 
  targeted with an allegation of wilful non-disclosure, though entirely legitimate, 
  are not constitutionally protected. </p>
<p>
  [95] Moreover, any potential unfairness to Crown counsel from inadequate notice 
  can be dealt with by the trial judge's inherent jurisdiction to control the 
  court's processes. Or it can be dealt with under rule 2.01(a), which authorizes 
  the court to grant relief &quot;to secure the just determination of the real 
  matters in dispute.&quot; For example, if an accused gives late notice of a 
  claim of wilful non-disclosure, the trial judge can grant a reasonable adjournment 
  to permit a Crown counsel to obtain advice, call evidence or even arrange for 
  another Crown to take over the proceedings. Thus, on the respondent's stay application, 
  had Ms. Hallett requested an adjournment, it undoubtedly would or should have 
  been granted.</p>
<p>
  [96] I would therefore reject the OCAA's call for a special rule to deal with 
  an allegation that a Crown counsel has intentionally withheld relevant information. 
  The existing rules coupled with the trial judge's inherent jurisdiction to control 
  the processes of the court offer adequate protection. In support of my conclusion 
  I can do no better than quote the observations of my former colleague Justice 
  Finlayson in R. v. Kutynec (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.) at 300: </p>
<p class="indent"> (3) The requirements constitute an unnecessary interference 
  with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of 
  the trial...</p>
<p class="indent">The great majority of criminal cases in this province are disposed 
  of by judges of the Provincial Division of the Ontario Court of Justice. Mandated 
  pre-trial procedures will do nothing to assist them in carrying out their duties 
  or to ease their case-loads. Rather than invent yet another procedural straitjacket 
  to compound their problems, it is better to leave to these trial judges the 
  discretion to determine the sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer 
  of proof.</p>
<p>
  I would not give effect to the OCAA's submission.</p>
<p>
  3. Did the application judge err in finding that Crown Counsel wilfully failed 
  to disclose Dunlop's materials and her July 4, 2000 letter?</p>
<p>
  [97] This is the most important issue on the appeal. The Crown did not disclose 
  Dunlop's materials to the defence before trial. Leduc sought a stay on the ground 
  that the Crown's failure to disclose was wilful. Therefore, the question the 
  application judge had to decide was whether Ms. Hallett saw the references to 
  Cory M.'s mother in Dunlop's materials and wilfully withheld this information 
  from Leduc, or whether she inadvertently overlooked these references. The application 
  judge found that her failure to disclose was wilful and granted a stay on that 
  ground. The Crown submits that there was no evidence to support a finding of 
  wilful non-disclosure. I agree with the Crown's submission.</p>
<p>
  [98] The Crown acknowledges that Dunlop's materials and Dupuis' note were relevant 
  information that should have been disclosed to Leduc before the trial began. 
  The right to disclosure of relevant information forms one component of the right 
  to make full answer and defence. The right to make full answer and defence is 
  a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the Charter. Thus, the Crown's 
  breach of its disclosure obligation amounted to a breach of Leduc's constitutional 
  rights. See R. v. Stinchcombe, supra, R. v. Carosella (1997), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 
  289 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [99] But the Crown's breach of its obligation to disclose does not automatically 
  entitle an accused to a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter. A 
  stay is a drastic remedy, a remedy of last resort, to be granted only in the 
  &quot;clearest of cases&quot;. It should be granted only in the rare cases where 
  compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles 
  of justice that underly the community's sense of fair play and decency. Or, 
  in the words of L'Heureux-Dube J. in R. v. O'Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411 at 
  468: a stay should be granted only &quot;where the prejudice to the accused's 
  right to make full answer and defence cannot be remedied or where irreparable 
  prejudice would be caused to the integrity of the judicial system if the prosecution 
  were continued.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [100] In this case, Leduc does not contend that his right to make full answer 
  and defence cannot be remedied. He contends that Ms. Hallett's failure to disclose 
  has caused irreparable prejudice to the integrity of the judicial system. Therefore, 
  both before the application judge and in this court Leduc acknowledged that 
  he is not entitled to a stay if Ms. Hallett's failure to disclose was inadvertent 
  or careless. </p>
<p>
  [101] Before the application judge, Leduc argued that he was entitled to a stay 
  only if Ms. Hallett's failure to disclose was wilful. His counsel made his position 
  clear at the beginning of the application: </p>
<p class="indent">
  At the outset, the foundation for the application for a stay of proceedings 
  which we acknowledge is the most serious of Constitutional remedies, is founded 
  on an allegation of wilful non-disclosure. If we fail to satisfy the court that 
  non-disclosure in this instance was wilful, then we will not seek that most 
  drastic of remedies, although, because of our position, that we have been severely 
  prejudiced, to the preparation and execution of our defence, we will certainly 
  seek and discuss with the court lesser remedies.</p>
<p>
  [102] In this court, Leduc sought to support the stay on the ground that either 
  Ms. Hallett's failure to disclose was wilful or grossly negligent. Accordingly, 
  in his factum, Leduc recognized that &quot;mere carelessness or civil negligence 
  would not be sufficient to justify the stay of proceedings for non-disclosure.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [103] In my opinion, the respondent cannot ask this court to find that Ms. Hallett's 
  conduct was grossly negligent when he neither sought nor obtained that finding 
  from the application judge. Moreover, as will be evident from my reasons, such 
  a finding cannot be supported on the record.</p>
<p>
  [104] The critical question is whether the application judge's finding that 
  Ms. Hallett wilfully withheld Dunlop's materials and her July 4, 2000 letter 
  can be supported on the evidence. If it cannot be supported, the order staying 
  the prosecution of Leduc must be set aside.</p>
<p>
  [105] The application judge's finding of wilful non-disclosure is a finding 
  of fact. That finding is entitled to deference from this court. It can be set 
  aside only if it was tainted by palpable and overriding error. See Housen v. 
  Nikolaisen (2002), 211 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [106] In my view, the application judge made palpable and overriding errors 
  that tainted his finding of wilful non-disclosure. His finding is entirely unsupported 
  by the record, does not take account of several exculpatory considerations and 
  flies in the face of the innocent explanation given by Ms. Hallett, an explanation 
  the application judge had no reason to reject.</p>
<p>
  [107] The finding of wilful non-disclosure rests on three planks: exhibit 22, 
  Ms. Hallett's July 4, 2000 letter; the evidence of Constable Genier; and the 
  application judge's rejection of Ms. Hallett's explanation. The crucial plank 
  appears to be exhibit 22 - both its contents and the circumstances of its disclosure 
  to the defence. According to the application judge, exhibit 22 showed Ms. Hallett 
  had reviewed Dunlop's materials in depth, and Constable Genier's evidence confirmed 
  that she had done so. Also, according to the application judge, Ms. Hallett 
  suppressed exhibit 22 from the defence. In my view the application judge misinterpreted 
  the contents of exhibit 22 and misapprehended the circumstances of its disclosure 
  to the defence. </p>
<p>
  [108] On July 4, 2000, Ms. Hallett had written to Detective Constable Dupuis 
  about disclosure of Perry Dunlop's materials to defence counsel in the MacDonald 
  case. Counsel for Leduc received a copy of the letter from Dupuis on February 
  20, 2001, the day before the stay application began before Chadwick J. </p>
<p>
  [109] Ms. Hallett's letter is headed: </p>
<p class="indent"> R. v. MacDonald (Charles);</p>
<p class="indent">Project Truth Investigation</p>
<p class="indent">Disclosure Items</p>
<p>
  [110] The letter largely reflects what Ms. Hallett had already told the trial 
  judge on February 14, 2001: that she had received a copy of Dunlop's material 
  in April 2000, that on her return to the office on July 17th she would review 
  these materials before making disclosure to the defence in the MacDonald case, 
  and that she would return to Cornwall in late July to complete her review. Here 
  is what Ms. Hallett wrote: </p>
<p class="indent"> Please find enclosed the notes of our clerk, Mr. Michael Chard, 
  taken at my request upon the unexpected visit by P.C. Perry Dunlop to the Crown 
  Law Office-Criminal on June 27, 2000. P.C. Dunlop brought with him a duplicate 
  of his statement dated April 7, 2000 and its appendices in the form of four 
  bound booklets, all of which were seized by D/Insp. Pat Hall on April 10, 2000. 
  I received a copy of the same statement with appendices from Project Truth on 
  April 17, 2000.</p>
<p class="indent">I will review the statement and appendices brought in by P.C. 
  Dunlop on June 27 to ensure that they are duplicates. I then propose to provide 
  them to my co-counsel Christine Bartlett for use on the MacDonald trial. These 
  items must still be reviewed by me prior to making disclosure to the defence, 
  which I will do upon my return to the office on July 17. I believe that you 
  have made a copy of these items for disclosure purposes, but are waiting to 
  deliver them to defence counsel pending my review.</p>
<p class="indent">Please also find enclosed a copy of P.C. Dunlop's letter delivered 
  to the Attorney General the same day as his visit to me. This item should also 
  be included in any new volume of the brief to be disclosed to the defence.</p>
<p class="indent">I propose to return to Cornwall in the week of either July 24th 
  or 31st for the purpose of completing my review of the Dunlop materials (Box 
  9) and meeting with M. to review his evidence in anticipation of 
  the preliminary inquiry.</p>
<p>
  [111] Constable Genier testified that Ms. Hallett began her review of the Dunlop 
  materials on May 3 and 4, 2000. Ms. Hallett had told the trial judge that her 
  review of the Dunlop materials had been &quot;cursory&quot;. On the basis of 
  exhibit 22 and Constable Genier's evidence the application judge concluded otherwise: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The letter clearly shows that the Crown had reviewed the Dunlop file in more 
  depth than a &quot;cursory review&quot;. This is also confirmed by the evidence 
  of Constable Genier &#133;</p>
<p>
  [112] Although he did not expressly say so, for his finding of wilful non-disclosure 
  to make sense, the application judge must have concluded that Ms. Hallett saw 
  the information she says that she overlooked. He must have concluded that in 
  her review of the Dunlop materials in 2000, Ms. Hallett had seen the reference 
  to the telephone calls with Cory M.'s mother but had withheld this information 
  to prevent Dunlop from contaminating the prosecution of the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [113] The application judge then concluded that Ms. Hallett also withheld her 
  letter, (along with the Dunlop materials which she had &quot;reviewed in depth&quot;) 
  &quot;to avoid Dunlop becoming an issue in the Leduc case&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [114] I see nothing in the contents of exhibit 22 or the evidence of Constable 
  Genier from which one can infer or find that Ms. Hallett saw the brief references 
  to Cory M.'s mother in Dunlop's materials and wilfully withheld this information 
  from Leduc. Several considerations undermine the application judge's reliance 
  on exhibit 22 to support his findings of wilful non-disclosure. Instead, these 
  considerations point to the opposite inference or finding, that Ms. Hallett 
  overlooked the references to the telephone calls between Dunlop and Cory M.'s 
  mother. </p>
<p>
  [115] First, the application judge misinterpreted the letter. He said that exhibit 
  22 &quot;shows the Crown had reviewed the Dunlop file in more depth than a cursory 
  review&quot;. But the letter speaks of a future review of Dunlop's materials 
  later in the month, not of a review that has already taken place. The letter 
  is dated July 4, 2000. In it Ms. Hallett says she will review the Dunlop materials 
  on July 17 and during the week of July 24 or July 31, not that she has already 
  done so.</p>
<p>
  [116] Second, the application judge failed to appreciate that in the spring 
  and summer of 2000, Ms. Hallett was reviewing Dunlop's materials for a different 
  case. As exhibit 22 shows, Ms. Hallett was reviewing Dunlop's materials to give 
  disclosure to the defence in the MacDonald case, not in the Leduc case. Undoubtedly 
  this coloured her review of the materials. Moreover, preparation for the MacDonald 
  case was likely foremost in her mind. The MacDonald preliminary inquiry was 
  set for that August. The Leduc trial was not scheduled to begin until the following 
  January. When Ms. Hallett found that Dunlop's documents contained information 
  relevant to the prosecution of MacDonald, she disclosed them to his counsel. 
  That she would do so in that case and yet, at the same time, deliberately suppress 
  evidence of two seemingly innocuous telephone calls between Dunlop and the mother 
  of one of the complainants in the Leduc case seems implausible.</p>
<p>
  [117] Third, the application judge failed to take into account that in reviewing 
  the Dunlop materials, Ms. Hallett had no reason to be on the lookout for a connection 
  to the Leduc case. The Crown's disclosure brief prepared by the police in 1999 
  contained no reference to Dunlop or his materials. Indeed, Dupuis' inadvertent 
  failure to include his June 15, 1998 handwritten note in the Crown brief shows 
  how easy it was to overlook these minor items. Even when the police gave Ms. 
  Hallett a copy of the Dunlop materials in the spring of 2000, they did not flag 
  the references to the Leduc case. No police officer made Ms. Hallett aware of 
  the discussion on July 23, 1998, between the police and Perry Dunlop or about 
  his telephone calls with Cory M.'s mother. Moreover, neither the evidence led 
  at the preliminary inquiry nor Ms. Hallett's interviews of the complainants 
  alerted her to any connection between Dunlop and the prosecution of Leduc. </p>
<p>
  [118] Fourth, the application judge did not consider the evidence of the Project 
  Truth investigators. The two lead OPP officers on the Leduc prosecution, Inspector 
  Hall and Detective Constable Dupuis, each testified that he saw no indication 
  Ms. Hallett intentionally withheld evidence prejudicial to the prosecution or 
  relevant to the defence. Their evidence was not challenged by Leduc.</p>
<p>
  [119] Fifth, the application judge took no account of the massive number of 
  documents generated by the Project Truth investigation. Dunlop's materials alone 
  consisted of over 600 pages of notes, of which nearly 200 were in handwriting 
  that was either illegible or hard to read. Neither Constable Genier's evidence 
  nor exhibit 22 suggests that Ms. Hallett reviewed or was going to review those 
  materials &quot;in depth&quot; in the spring and summer of 2000, much less that 
  she actually saw the references to the telephone calls with Cory M.'s mother.</p>
<p>
  [120] In my view, these considerations show that the conclusion the application 
  judge drew from the contents of exhibit 22 and Constable Genier's evidence is 
  unsupportable. I believe these considerations lead to but one conclusion: Ms. 
  Hallett made an honest mistake. Her failure to disclose was inadvertent. </p>
<p>
  [121] The application judge also used the way in which the defence obtained 
  a copy of exhibit 22 to support his finding of wilful non-disclosure. In doing 
  so he misapprehended what occurred.</p>
<p>
  [122] On February 8, 2001, the day after Cory M.'s mother testified about her 
  telephone calls with Dunlop, Inspector Hall arranged for a copy of Ms. Hallett's 
  July 4, 2000 letter to be delivered to her. In the top right hand corner, he 
  wrote: &quot;SHELLY for your information P. R. Hall&quot;. On the stay application, 
  Hall testified that he expected Ms. Hallett to disclose the letter to the defence, 
  though he had not asked her to do so. In fact, she had not done so.</p>
<p>
  [123] On February 20, 2001, the day before the stay application was to begin 
  before Chadwick J., Hall and Dupuis met with counsel for Leduc to discuss what 
  questions they would be asked. During the meeting they were asked whether any 
  document existed showing that Ms. Hallett had reviewed Perry Dunlop's will say 
  statement. They volunteered Ms. Hallett's July 4 letter to Dupuis and offered 
  to give a copy to Leduc's counsel. As Dupuis could not find the original of 
  the letter, he obtained from Ms. Hallett the copy that Hall had given to her 
  on February 8. </p>
<p>
  [124] On the application, Leduc's counsel claimed that they only learned about 
  the letter because a senior Project Truth investigator &quot;had to bypass lead 
  Crown counsel and make direct disclosure to the defence in order to circumvent 
  her refusal to do so&quot;. The application judge seemed to accept this claim. 
  He found that Ms. Hallett intentionally withheld the letter.</p>
<p>
  [125] The finding has no support in the evidence. Inspector Hall acknowledged 
  that he never suggested Ms. Hallett should disclose the letter to the defence. 
  Both Hall and Dupuis testified that Ms. Hallett did not try to suppress the 
  letter, had no qualms about giving it to the defence and readily provided her 
  copy. Moreover, the letter itself says little more than what Ms. Hallett had 
  already told the trial judge in her oral submissions the previous week. Finally, 
  disclosure of the letter was contrary to the Crown's usual practice concerning 
  correspondence between Crown counsel and the police. The Disclosure Guidelines 
  then in force for Ontario Crown Attorneys stipulated, &quot;Crown counsel generally 
  need not disclose any internal Crown counsel &#133; correspondence&quot;. Thus, 
  not only did Ms. Hallett not suppress the letter, she had no reason to disclose 
  it. </p>
<p>
  [126] I therefore conclude that the finding of wilful non-disclosure has no 
  support in the record. It fails to take account of the several considerations 
  showing that the non-disclosure was innocent and inadvertent. And it is based 
  on a misapprehension of what occurred. In these ways the finding is tainted 
  by &quot;palpable and overriding errors&quot;. It must be set aside.</p>
<p>
  [127] I would set aside the finding of wilful non-disclosure even without considering 
  Ms. Hallett's innocent explanation for what occurred. But her innocent explanation 
  provides an additional reason for setting aside the finding.</p>
<p>
  [128] In her submissions to the application judge, Ms. Hallett maintained - 
  as she had before the trial judge - that her failure to disclose was inadvertent. 
  She again explained that she had Dunlop's notes and will say statement in the 
  spring of 2000, and that she had reviewed the material in order to give disclosure 
  in the MacDonald case.</p>
<p>
  [129] Ms. Hallett acknowledged that since 1996 Dunlop had harboured a great 
  deal of animus toward Leduc and had targeted him as a conspirator in the alleged 
  cover-up of sexual abuse in the Cornwall area. But, she &quot;had frankly compartmentalized 
  Leduc as being a case that was more or less ready for trial and wasn't in any 
  way involved - did not engage in any way the Dunlop issue.&quot; Consequently 
  she overlooked the references to Dunlop's telephone calls with Cory M.'s mother.</p>
<p>
  [130] The application judge rejected Ms. Hallett's explanation. In doing so 
  he observed that she did not testify on the application. And he concluded that 
  her statement to the trial judge that she made only a &quot;cursory review&quot; 
  of Dunlop's materials &quot;appears to be contrary to the evidence&quot;. He 
  said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Ms. Hallett, the Crown, did not give evidence on the stay. In her submissions, 
  she explained how she compartmentalized each file. She did not find the Dunlop 
  material relevant to the Leduc file. In her remarks to Justice McKinnon on 
  February 14th, 2001, she indicated that she had only made a &quot;cursory review&quot; 
  of the Dunlop documents. This statement appears to be contrary to the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [131] This part of the application judge's reasons may be viewed in two ways: 
  either he drew an adverse inference from Ms. Hallett's failure to testify on 
  the stay application or he simply rejected her innocent explanation. He should 
  not have done either. </p>
<p>
  [132] Ms. Hallett recognized that the Crown owed both the court and the respondent 
  and explanation for the non-disclosure. See R. v. Ahluwalia, supra. She should, 
  however, have given her explanation from the witness box instead of from the 
  counsel table. She should have arranged for another Crown to take carriage of 
  the stay application and lead her evidence. The reasons why she should have 
  done so are grounded in the principle that ordinarily a lawyer cannot be both 
  an advocate and a witness in the same case. See, for example, Imperial Oil v. 
  Grabarchuk (1974), 3 O.R. (2d) 783 (C.A.). If an advocate wishes to give evidence 
  about material and contested facts, the advocate must take off his or her gown 
  and testify under oath. Otherwise, the advocate's statements are shielded from 
  cross-examination and the court has to make findings of credibility on untested 
  evidence.</p>
<p>
  [133] Moreover, being an advocate and a witness in the same case raises professional 
  conduct concerns. Giving evidence from the counsel table puts in question the 
  advocate's personal credibility, compromises the advocate's objectivity and 
  potentially puts the advocate in a conflict of interest. </p>
<p>
  [134] Here, for example, some might perceive that Ms. Hallett was defending 
  her own actions at the expense of her obligation as Crown counsel to the administration 
  of justice. Thus for good reason, except in rare cases, both law society codes 
  of professional conduct and courts advise against being advocate and witness 
  in the same case. The following observations of the Manitoba Court of Appeal 
  in R. v. Deslauriers (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 329 at 337 have considerable merit: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Counsel's objective role is also compromised in a case such as this where his 
  own conduct or judgment has to be taken into account by the court in resolving 
  an issue between parties. Counsel ends up in these circumstances justifying 
  his own conduct and judgment and attacking those of opposing counsel. This is 
  a situation which should be avoided. Whenever possible, other counsel should 
  be retained.</p>
<p>
  [135] That said, it seems to me that Ms. Hallett had no forewarning, either 
  from the judge or from the opposing counsel that her explanation for the non-disclosure 
  would not be accepted unless she testified. Both the trial judge and the application 
  judge had adopted an informal approach to the giving of evidence. Each had permitted 
  counsel on both sides to make assertions of fact during their submissions. Neither 
  objected when Ms. Hallett explained her conduct from the counsel table. Given 
  this context, if the application judge was not going to consider or was going 
  to give less weight to Ms. Hallett's explanation because she did not give it 
  under oath, he had an obligation to tell her. Simple fairness required that 
  he do so: see M. Proulx and D. Layton, Ethics and Canadian Criminal Law (Toronto: 
  Irwin Law, 2001) at 344-345. Thus, I do not think any adverse inference should 
  have been drawn from Ms. Hallett's failure to testify, at least not without 
  warning her of that possibility.</p>
<p> [136] Having considered Ms. Hallett's innocent explanation, the application 
  judge was, of course, entitled to reject it, provided he had grounds for doing 
  so. In my view he had none. By rejecting Ms. Hallett's explanation he found 
  not just that she was not credible but that she had misled the court. Yet he 
  made that finding without any supporting evidence. Mainly for the reasons I 
  have already discussed, the record shows that the non-disclosure in this case 
  was not wilful. Here I emphasize three pieces of evidence that support Ms. Hallett's 
  innocent account: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Crown disclosure brief prepared by the police contained no reference 
    to Dunlop;</li>
  <li>The evidence at the preliminary inquiry revealed no connection to Dunlop; 
    and</li>
  <li>On the stay application, each complainant testified that he had had no contact 
    with Dunlop.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [137] The finding of wilful non-disclosure cannot stand. I would set it aside 
  and with it I would set aside the stay of proceedings. I will now consider whether 
  the stay was justified even if the finding of wilful non-disclosure were permitted 
  to stand .</p>
<p>
  4. Did the application judge err in granting a stay of proceedings?</p>
<p>
  [138] Because the application judge's finding of wilful non-disclosure cannot 
  be supported, neither can his order for a stay. But I would go further. Even 
  accepting the finding of wilful non-disclosure, the drastic remedy of a stay 
  of proceedings cannot be justified.</p>
<p>
  [139] The application judge's order granting a stay is a discretionary order. 
  It is entitled to deference on appeal. This court should interfere with the 
  application judge's exercise of discretion only if he misdirected himself or 
  if his decision is &quot;so clearly wrong that it amounts to an injustice&quot;. 
  See Elsom v. Elsom, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1367 at 1375; R. v. Regan (2002), 161 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at para. 117.</p>
<p>
  [140] In my view the application judge did misdirect himself. And his order 
  is so clearly wrong that it does amount to an injustice. The application judge 
  made four related errors, each of which undermines his order for a stay. First, 
  he did not apply the correct test for a stay for prosecutorial misconduct. Second, 
  he justified the stay on a ground that Leduc has never asserted: a breach of 
  his right to a fair trial within a reasonable time guaranteed by s. 11(b) of 
  the Charter. Third, he did not apply the well-established guidelines for a s. 
  11(b) violation. Fourth, he relied on items of prejudice that were not supported 
  in the record. I will deal with each of these errors.</p>
<p>
  [141] The application judge ordered a stay because he concluded that Ms. Hallett's 
  wilful non-disclosure irreparably prejudiced Leduc's right to a fair trial within 
  a reasonable time. The application judge recognized that a stay should be granted 
  only in the clearest of cases. He also referred to passages from the Supreme 
  Court of Canada's judgments in R. v. O'Connor, supra and R. v. Dixon (1998), 
  122 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), which establish that to obtain a stay, the non-disclosure 
  must have irreparably prejudiced either the accused's right to make full answer 
  and defence or the integrity of the administration of justice contrary to s. 
  7 of the Charter. But the application judge failed to advert to the now recognized 
  test for a stay for prosecutorial misconduct.</p>
<p>
  [142] Prosecutorial misconduct, such as wilful non-disclosure, standing alone 
  does not warrant a stay. To justify a stay, the misconduct must either prevent 
  a fair trial or undermine the integrity of our justice system. Most cases where 
  a stay is ordered fall into the former category. A small number of cases - &quot;exceptional&quot; 
  or &quot;relatively very rare&quot; cases - fall into the latter or &quot;residual&quot; 
  category, where trial fairness can be preserved by a remedy short of a stay, 
  but the integrity of the justice system cannot. In either category of case, 
  </p>
<p class="indent"> . . . a stay of proceedings will only be appropriate when two 
  criteria are met: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) the prejudice caused by the abuse in question will be manifested, 
  perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcomes; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">(2) no other remedy is reasonably capable of removing the prejudice 
  . . .</p>
<p class="indent">Where uncertainty persists about whether the abuse is sufficient 
  to warrant the drastic remedy of the stay . . . a third criterion is considered. 
  This is the stage where a traditional balancing of interests is done: it will 
  be appropriate to balance the interest that would be served by the granting 
  of a stay of proceedings against the interest that society has in having the 
  final decision on the merits.&quot; See R. v. Regan, at 122-123, citing Canada 
  (Minister of Citizenship &amp; Immigration) v. Tobiass, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391.</p>
<p>
  [143] The application judge not only failed to address these criteria, he seemed 
  to focus on whether the wilful non-disclosure prejudiced Leduc's fair trial 
  rights. Leduc, however, sought a stay on the ground that the wilful non-disclosure 
  irreparably prejudiced the integrity of the justice system. Although Leduc maintained 
  that the non-disclosure prejudiced his right to a fair trial, he acknowledged 
  that this prejudice could be addressed by a remedy short of stay.</p>
<p>
  [144] That was a fair acknowledgement. Leduc now has Dunlop's materials and 
  Dupuis' notes. The innocuous telephone calls between Dunlop and Cory M.'s mother 
  were at best marginally relevant to the defence. The record disclosed that none 
  of the three complainants had any contact with Dunlop. Most important, nothing 
  in the evidence suggests that Ms. Hallett's untimely disclosure will impair 
  Leduc's right to make full answer and defence or otherwise prevent him from 
  having a fair trial.</p>
<p>
  [145] Nor does this case fall into the residual category of cases where a stay 
  must be ordered because to continue the prosecution would irreparably prejudice 
  the integrity of our justice system. The remedy of a stay does not dwell on 
  past misconduct but looks to the future. The critical first criterion is whether 
  any prejudice caused by the wilful non-disclosure will be manifested or perpetuated 
  or aggravated through the conduct of the trial or by its outcome. I am not persuaded 
  that it will be. Even accepting that Ms. Hallett's non-disclosure was wilful, 
  nothing suggests that this non-disclosure is likely to continue. Whatever prejudice 
  may have been caused will not be perpetuated by continuing the trial. </p>
<p>
  [146] The second criterion asks whether another remedy can reasonably remove 
  any prejudice caused by the wilful non-disclosure. Here, even assuming wilful 
  non-disclosure, a combination of remedies would have removed any prejudice: 
  an order expediting a new trial, an order that Ms. Hallett not prosecute the 
  new trial and an order that the Crown pay Leduc his costs of the first trial.</p>
<p>
  [147] If uncertainty persists after the application of these first two criteria, 
  the application of the third criterion removes any doubt that a stay is not 
  justified. Several considerations - none of which were referred to by the application 
  judge - point to the public interest in having a trial: each youthful complainant 
  testified to several incidents of serious sexual abuse; victims of sexual abuse 
  must be encouraged to trust the criminal justice system; and the community, 
  which had been &quot;riveted&quot; by this and the other Project Truth cases, 
  was entitled to a decision on the merits. See R. v. Regan. This is not that 
  very rare case where the misconduct is &quot;so egregious that the mere fact 
  of going forward in the light of it will be offensive&quot;. See Canada v. Tobiass, 
  supra at para. 91. Indeed far more serious Crown misconduct in Tobiass, Regan 
  and R. v. Latimer, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 217 did not warrant a stay. One should not 
  have been granted in this case.</p>
<p>
  [148] Moreover, the application judge ultimately seemed to justify a stay on 
  a ground that Leduc never put forward: the wilful non-disclosure had resulted 
  in a violation of his s. 11(b) Charter right to a trial within a reasonable 
  time. Leduc did not contend that declaring a mistrial and ordering a new trial 
  would violate his constitutional right under s. 11(b) of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  [149] In addition, in finding that Leduc could no longer get a fair trial within 
  a reasonable time, the application judge did not apply the framework established 
  by the Supreme Court for determining whether a s. 11(b) violation has taken 
  place. See, for example, R. v. Morin (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). Section 
  11(b) determinations are fact driven. But the application judge was not aware 
  of many of the relevant facts. These facts included the inherent time requirements 
  of the case, Leduc's waiver of his s. 11(b) rights on March 31, 2000 in connection 
  with the January 15, 2001 trial date, the limits on institutional resources, 
  and the length of the delay that would be caused by a mistrial.</p>
<p> [150] Finally, the items of prejudice on which the application judge relied 
  to find that Leduc could no longer receive a fair trial within a reasonable 
  time were not supported by the record. The application judge concluded that 
  because Dunlop's materials were relevant, the trial judge would likely have 
  had to recuse himself and declare a mistrial. He then pointed to five items 
  of prejudice that would result from a new trial: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The continuous publicity for Leduc, which has caused him and his family 
    a great deal of hardship.</li>
  <li>The &quot;financial strain&quot; on Leduc: &quot;In order to defend a trial 
    of this magnitude, you either have to be poor or rich. There is no in-between. 
    I suspect the accused is neither.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;A mistrial will require the complainants and other witnesses to testify 
    again, a tremendous hardship on them.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;Dunlop will be a necessary witness at a new trial. He will have to 
    be properly subpoenaed and a warrant issued if he fails to attend &#133; [and] 
    his evidence will have to be the subject of a voir dire.&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;In view of all these issues and the scheduling of counsel and witnesses, 
    a new trial would probably not be conducted for sometime.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [151] Leduc did not testify on the stay application. He did not call any evidence 
  about either the hardship to his family caused by the publicity surrounding 
  his trial or the &quot;financial strain&quot; of the proceedings. Publicity 
  and costs, however unpleasant or unpalatable, were two inevitable consequences 
  of the charges against the respondent, regardless of the Crown's failure to 
  disclose the Dunlop materials before trial. Hardship resulting from properly 
  laid charges, as these were, does not amount to an abuse of process. Even accepting 
  that the trial judge would have had to declare a mistrial, the application judge 
  failed to assess separately the ongoing hardship that might be caused by the 
  non-disclosure, and indeed he had no evidence to do so. He gave short shrift 
  to making a cost order against the Crown even though he recognized that such 
  an order could reimburse Leduc for the costs of the trial before McKinnon J.</p>
<p>
  [152] Undoubtedly the complainants and the Crown's witnesses would prefer not 
  to have to testify again at a second trial, but none testified that he or she 
  was unwilling to do so, or that to do so would cause a &quot;tremendous hardship&quot;. 
  If Dunlop's materials remain relevant, he likely will be a witness, but I fail 
  to see why his proposed evidence must be subject to a voir dire and even if 
  it is, why his testimony will unduly prolong the trial. Finally, a new trial 
  can be expedited. Neither party suggested that it could not be held within a 
  reasonable time.</p>
<p>
  [153] Certainly a new trial could have been avoided had the Crown disclosed 
  Dunlop's materials before the trial began. As the application judge pointed 
  out, had McKinnon J. known before the trial began of Dunlop's connection to 
  the prosecution of the respondent he would have declined to sit on the case. 
  However, because of the late disclosure, he began the trial without this knowledge. 
  Had the application judge dismissed the request for a stay and had Leduc maintained 
  that he would raise Dunlop's conversations with Cory M.'s mother, the trial 
  judge would have had to declare a mistrial and order a new trial.</p>
<p>
  [154] New trials should be avoided where possible. The accused, the other participants 
  in the trial, the criminal justice system and the community at large must all 
  suffer the consequences - financial, emotional and otherwise - of going through 
  the proceedings again. That the respondent will have to do so, however, does 
  not by itself make out a violation of s. 11(b) of the Charter. Yet the items 
  of prejudice on which the application judge relied to find a s. 11(b) violation 
  were rooted in conjecture, not in the evidentiary record.</p>
<p>
  [155] I therefore conclude that even if the finding of wilful non-disclosure 
  were to stand, the order granting a stay was &quot;so clearly wrong&quot; that 
  to maintain it would amount to an injustice. I would set the stay aside. In 
  the light of the passage of time and the likelihood the respondent will rely 
  on Dunlop's connection to this case, I would order a new trial. I would also 
  order that the new trial be expedited.</p>
<p>
  5. Did the application judge err in awarding costs against the Crown?</p>
<p>
  [156] The application judge ordered the Crown to pay Leduc his costs of the 
  trial before McKinnon J. and of the stay application. His order was rooted 
  in his finding that Ms. Hallett wilfully failed to disclose relevant information 
  to the defence. As I would set aside that finding, it can no longer support 
  a costs award against the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [157] The question remains however, whether the costs award can be supported 
  on any other basis. In R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc. (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 321, 
  the Supreme Court affirmed the court's jurisdiction to award costs in criminal 
  trials for a violation of the Charter. A costs award may, under s. 24(1) of 
  the Charter, be &quot;appropriate and just in the circumstances.&quot; Moreover, 
  the Supreme Court recognized that costs awards play a &quot;vital role in enforcing 
  the standards of disclosure,&quot; first established in Stinchcombe.</p>
<p>
  [158] Nonetheless the Supreme Court and provincial appellate courts have stopped 
  short of awarding costs against the Crown for an innocent or inadvertent breach 
  of its obligation to disclose. Instead, the jurisprudence to date has restricted 
  costs awards against the Crown to &quot;circumstances of a marked and unacceptable 
  departure from the reasonable standards expected of the prosecution.&quot; In 
  the 974649 Ontario Inc. case at p. 356, McLachlin C.JC. explained this restriction: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Neither is there any indication that the Crown will be subjected to such awards 
  unfairly or arbitrarily. Crown counsel is not held to a standard of perfection, 
  and costs awards will not flow from every failure to disclose in a timely fashion. 
  Rather, the developing jurisprudence uniformly restricts such awards, at a minimum, 
  to circumstances of a marked and unacceptable departure from the reasonable 
  standards expected of the prosecution. I fail to see how the provision of an 
  expedient remedy in such cases, from a trial court that is not only competent 
  but also ideally situated to make such an assessment, risks disrupting the existing 
  system of justice.</p>
<p>
  [159] Thus, although such costs awards have a compensatory element, they are 
  &quot;integrally connected to the court's control of its trial process, and 
  intended as a means of disciplining and discouraging flagrant and unjustified 
  incidents of non-disclosure&quot; (at p. 354). </p>
<p>
  [160] Restricting these awards to cases where the Crown's failure to disclose 
  reflects a marked and unacceptable departure from the standards of a reasonable 
  prosecutor is grounded in sound policy considerations. In R. v. Robinson (2000), 
  142 C.C.C. (3d) 303 (Alta. C.A.), McFadyen J.A. canvasses some of these considerations 
  at p. 315 and again at p. 316: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The reasons for limiting costs are that the Crown is not an ordinary litigant, 
  does not win or lose criminal cases, and conducts prosecutions and makes decisions 
  respecting prosecutions in the public interest. In the absence of proof of misconduct, 
  an award of costs against the Crown would be a harsh penalty for a Crown officer 
  carrying out such public duties.</p>
<p class="center"> . . . </p>
<p class="indent"> Costs should not be routinely awarded. Something more than 
  a bona fide disagreement as to the applicable law, or a technical, unintended 
  or innocent breach, whether clearly established or not, must be required. Otherwise, 
  the criminal courts will be inundated with applications in this regard. We cannot 
  ignore the fact that disclosure issues continue to occupy much of the Courts' 
  time and attention in criminal trials, despite the existence of rules relating 
  to disclosure, and often, good faith attempts on the part of police and Crown 
  prosecutors to discharge their duties. Some degree of misconduct or an unacceptable 
  degree of negligence must be present before costs are awarded against the Crown 
  under s. 24(1) of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  [161] Applying this case law to the present case, I do not think that a costs 
  award against the Crown can be supported. Although Ms. Hallett's untimely disclosure 
  amounted to a breach of Leduc's constitutional rights under s. 7 of the Charter, 
  the failure to disclose was innocent and inadvertent. Ms. Hallett's conduct 
  was not wilful. It did not amount to a &quot;marked and unacceptable departure 
  from the reasonable standards&quot; expected of a prosecutor. It therefore does 
  not justify a costs award against the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [162] The Crown's untimely disclosure has led to a new trial, which would have 
  been the likely result even had the stay application not been brought. Assuming 
  the defence will rely on Dunlop's contact with Cory M.'s mother, the late disclosure 
  disqualifies the trial judge from continuing the trial. Had he known of Dunlop's 
  connection to the case at the outset, he would not have presided at all. Thus, 
  the late disclosure unfortunately means that many days of trial have been wasted. 
  The parties will have to start afresh. On the existing jurisprudence, however, 
  whatever unfairness has been visited on Leduc cannot be remedied by a costs 
  award against the Crown. Thus, I would set aside the application judge's order 
  that the Crown pay Leduc his costs of the trial and of the stay application.</p>
<p>
  F. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [163] For these reasons I would allow the appeal and make the following orders: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) I would set aside the finding of wilful non-disclosure; 
</p>
<p class="indent">(2) I would set aside the order staying the proceedings;</p>
<p class="indent">(3) I would set aside the costs orders against the Crown;</p>
<p class="indent">(4) I would order a new trial; and</p>
<p class="indent">(5) I would order that the new trial be expedited.</p>
<p>
  [164] I end these reasons by thanking all counsel for their assistance on the 
  appeal.</p>
