<p>On appeal from the order quashing the indictment by Justice Alfred J. Stong 
  of the Superior Court of Justice dated April 29, 2002. </p> <P>
  SIMMONS J.A.:</p> <P>
  [1] The main issue on this appeal is whether the application judge had jurisdiction 
  to amend the indictment in the manner requested by the Crown. </p> <P>
  [2] The respondent was born on March 13, 1947. He was charged with committing 
  gross indecency and indecent assault against the complainant during the period 
  between February 5, 1962 and February 5, 1968. Accordingly, as originally drafted, 
  the information spanned a time frame when the respondent was between the ages 
  of 14 and 20.</p> <P>
  [3] At the preliminary inquiry, the complainant testified to a series of incidents 
  beginning when he was between the ages of 6 and 9, but possibly as early as 
  5, and continuing until he was 11, 12 or even 13. Based on this evidence, at 
  the request of the Crown, the time frame in the information was amended to commence 
  on February 4, 1960. As amended, the information spanned a time frame when the 
  respondent was between the ages of 12 and 20. </p> <P>
  [4] At the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry, the respondent was committed 
  for trial in the Superior Court based on the amended information.</p> <P>
  [5] At the opening of trial, the defence moved to quash the indictment for want 
  of jurisdiction. In particular, the defence pointed out that, at the time of 
  the alleged offences, the Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1952 c. 160, gave 
  the Juvenile Court exclusive jurisdiction in cases of delinquency, including 
  matters involving children under the age 16 who were alleged to have committed 
  criminal offences. </p> <P>
  [6] The Crown responded with a motion to amend the indictment so that the time 
  frame of the alleged offence would begin on March 13, 1963, which was the date 
  of the appellant's 16 birthday. The Crown also undertook not to take proceedings 
  against the respondent under the Juvenile Delinquents Act. </p> <P>
  [7] Relying on R. v. S.(D.) (1997), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 162 (Sask. C.A.), the application 
  judge quashed the indictment, holding that where the time frame of an alleged 
  offence overlaps the accused's status as a youth and his status as an adult, 
  the proper procedure is to commence proceedings in youth court and have the 
  youth court determine the proper forum for the trial on a transfer application 
  held pursuant to s. 16 of the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1.</p> <P>
  [8] On appeal, the respondent submitted simply that the indictment was a nullity 
  and that the application judge had no jurisdiction to amend it.</p> <P>
  [9] I disagree. For the reasons set out by Dickson C.J. in R. v. Moore (1988), 
  41 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.) at p. 297, the indictment was not a nullity, and 
  was therefore capable of amendment:</p> 
<P class="indent"> The result of these two cases is that it is no longer possible 
  to say that a defective information is automatically a nullity disclosing no 
  offence known to law. If the document gives fair notice of the offence to the 
  accused, it is not a nullity and can be amended under the broad powers of amendment 
  s. 529 gives to the courts. Only if a charge is so badly drawn up as to fail 
  even to give the accused notice of the charge will it fail the minimum test 
  required by s. 510(2)(c).</p> 
<P>
  [10] Based on the factors set out in s. 601(4) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 
  1985, c. C-46, including the nature of the evidence, the circumstances of the 
  case, and my conclusion that there would be no prejudice or injustice to the 
  respondent if the requested amendment were permitted, I would allow the appeal, 
  vacate the order quashing the indictment, amend the indictment in the manner 
  requested by the Crown to cover the period between March 13, 1963 and February 
  4, 1968, and remit the matter to the Superior Court of Justice for trial.</p> <P>
  Released: April 2, 2003 &quot;RSA&quot;</p> 
<p> &quot;Janet Simmons J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree R.S. Abella J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree Robert P. Armstrong J.A.&quot;</p>
