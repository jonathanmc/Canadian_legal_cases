<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Susan Lang of the Superior Court of 
  Justice, dated July 27, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant, Hongkong Bank of Canada, raises four grounds of appeal. 
  It submits that the trial judge erred: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) by failing to find that the respondent, L.L.P. Holdings 
  Limited (&quot;LLP&quot;), acquiesced in and ratified the transfer of LLP's 
  funds from the appellant bank to an account at Central Guaranty Trust Company 
  (&quot;Central&quot;);</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) by failing to find that LLP was contributorily negligent 
  in relation to the transfer of its funds to Central and the subsequent theft 
  of them;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) by failing to draw an adverse inference against LLP as 
  a result of its failure to call certain witnesses at trial; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) by failing to reduce the amount of damages awarded to LLP 
  by (a) the sum of approximately $495,000 on account of Mr. Pilzmaker's alleged 
  share of the transferred funds; and (b) the sum of $5,767.83 paid to LLP's accountants.</p>
<p>
  [2] For the reasons that follow, we would not give effect to any of those grounds 
  of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (1) The Trial Judge's Rejection of the Defences of Acquiescence,</p>
<p>
  Ratification and Contributory Negligence</p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge rejected the appellant's submission that LLP, by its conduct, 
  acquiesced in and ratified the transfer of the $4 million in issue from the 
  appellant bank to Central. She also rejected the appellant's assertion that 
  LLP was negligent in failing to recognize that the funds had been removed from 
  the appellant bank and deposited with Central.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant argues before this court that, in rejecting the defences of 
  acquiescence, ratification, and contributory negligence, the trial judge erred 
  in law by admitting into evidence and relying upon out-of-court statements allegedly 
  made by Mr. Pilzmaker to Mr. La Gamba regarding LLP's funds. On the basis of 
  those statements, it is argued, the trial judge found that Mr. La Gamba, as 
  the president of LLP, had been lulled into believing until 1990 that LLP's funds 
  were on deposit with the appellant bank and that Mr. Pilzmaker was engaged in 
  looking for alternative investments for the funds. Those findings, the appellant 
  submits, flow from the improper reliance by the trial judge on the truth of 
  the contents of Mr. Pilzmaker's statements to Mr. La Gamba.</p>
<p>
  [5] We do not agree that the evidence concerning Mr. Pilzmaker's out-of-court 
  statements to Mr. La Gamba was admitted, or relied upon, by the trial judge 
  for impermissible purposes.</p>
<p>
  [6] Mr. La Gamba's testimony regarding the statements was not tendered as proof 
  of the truth of the contents of the statements but, rather, as proof of the 
  fact that the statements were made. In those circumstances, the rule against 
  the admission of hearsay evidence is not engaged. As observed by Sopinka J., 
  writing for a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada, in R. v. Evans, [1993] 
  3 S.C.R. 653 at 661 and 663-64: </p>
<p class="indent">
  An out-of-court statement which is admitted for the truth of its contents is 
  hearsay. An out-of-court statement offered simply as proof that the statement 
  was made is not hearsay, and is admissible as long as it has some probative 
  value. &#133;</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent"> The admission of this kind of evidence is not hearsay because 
  the only issue is whether the statement was made, and the veracity, perception 
  and memory of the witness relating the statement can be fully tested by cross-examination. 
  Since the truth of the declarant's assertion is not in issue, deprivation of 
  the right to cross-examine the declarant, on which rejection of hearsay is premised, 
  is of no consequence [citations omitted].</p>
<p>
  [7] In this case, Mr. La Gamba's state of mind and belief concerning the whereabouts 
  of LLP's funds, and Mr. Pilzmaker's activities in relation to the funds, were 
  central to the appellant's defences of acquiescence, ratification and contributory 
  negligence. The out-of-court statements made to Mr. La Gamba by Mr. Pilzmaker 
  influenced the former's state of mind and belief. Thus, the fact of the statements 
  was directly relevant to the defences raised by the appellant, regardless of 
  the truth or falsity of the statements. The evidence of the statements, in those 
  circumstances, was not hearsay and was properly admitted and relied upon by 
  the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [8] In addition, and importantly, the trial judge's rejection of the defences 
  of acquiescence, ratification, and contributory negligence was not based solely, 
  or even primarily, on the fact of Mr. Pilzmaker's statements to Mr. La Gamba; 
  nor did the trial judge ignore the evidence relied upon by the appellant to 
  support its claims of LLP's acquiescence, ratification, and negligence. Rather, 
  the trial judge extensively reviewed the evidence relied upon by the appellant, 
  and considered the cumulative effect of all the circumstances. She based her 
  conclusions on the context of the events as they unfolded over many, many months 
  and the circumstances in which they occurred, including: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) her assessment of Mr. La Gamba's credibility and the reliability 
  of his explanations for the alleged contradictions between his evidence at trial 
  and evidence given by him at earlier stages in the proceeding;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the fact that Mr. La Gamba did not transfer his own funds 
  to Central, which the trial judge found he would have done if he believed that 
  Mr. Pilzmaker had obtained a better interest rate for LLP's funds at Central;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) her finding that Mr. La Gamba had no reason to believe 
  that the appellant bank would not honour the requirement for two signatures 
  from LLP representatives as a pre-condition to the removal or transfer of any 
  LLP funds in excess of $1,000;</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) the demonstrated fact of Mr. Pilzmaker's own history of 
  poor documentary practices, even when acting honestly;</p>
<p class="indent">(v) the perception of many that Mr. Pilzmaker was a man of immense 
  wealth who would have no cause to steal; and</p>
<p class="indent">(vi) Mr. La Gamba's brief and relatively unsophisticated experience 
  with &quot;high-level&quot; banking.</p>
<p>
  [9] Against that contextual backdrop, the trial judge concluded that Mr. La 
  Gamba's failure to ascertain the improper removal of LLP's funds, and to notify 
  the appellant of same, &quot;cannot be said to amount to acquiescence, constructive 
  knowledge, laches or negligence&quot;. She had earlier concluded in her reasons 
  that Mr. La Gamba did not know about the transfer of LLP's funds until 1990, 
  and that LLP did not ratify at any time the removal of those funds by Mr. Pilzmaker. 
  We see no error in those conclusions, which were open to the trial judge on 
  the evidence properly admitted before her.</p>
<p>
  [10] It is appropriate, in our view, to make one further comment regarding the 
  trial judge's rejection of the appellant's defence of ratification. In transferring 
  LLP's funds to Central, Mr. Pilzmaker exercised his authority concerning LLP 
  for his own personal benefit. His improper design in that regard was established 
  by proof of the fact that the Central account required only his signature to 
  authorize withdrawals, which had the effect of removing the transferred funds 
  from LLP's control. Mr. Pilzmaker's removal of LLP's funds from the appellant 
  bank, on the evidence accepted by the trial judge, was carried out without the 
  knowledge of Mr. La Gamba and was not the act of his principal, nor carried 
  out for his principal's benefit. The defence of ratification is not available 
  in those circumstances: Begley v. Imperial Bank of Canada, [1935] S.C.R. 89 
  at 105, [1936] 3 D.L.R. 1 at 8 (J.C.P.C.)</p>
<p>
  (2) The Failure to Draw an Adverse Inference</p>
<p>
  [11] We are also not persuaded that the trial judge erred in declining to draw 
  an adverse inference against LLP as a result of its failure to call the Lams 
  to testify at trial. As the appellant points out, the evidence of the Lams, 
  who are minority shareholders in LLP and who reside outside of Canada, could 
  have been obtained through commission evidence. It was open to the appellant, 
  as well as the respondent, to proffer their evidence. It failed to do so.</p>
<p>
  [12] In addition, and significantly, the trial judge's finding that any evidence 
  from the Lams could not have made a material contribution to the outcome of 
  the case is supported by the evidentiary record at trial: the Lams were not 
  signatories to LLP's accounts with the appellant; they did not receive banking 
  statements from the appellant concerning LLP's funds and accounts; they had 
  no authority over LLP's banking arrangements with the appellant; and they did 
  not participate in any dealings between LLP and the appellant or among LLP, 
  Central and Mr. Pilzmaker. In those circumstances, the trial judge committed 
  no error in declining to draw an adverse inference.</p>
<p>
  (3) The Claimed Deductions from the Award of Damages</p>
<p>
  [13] In our view, the two deductions claimed by the appellant from the damages 
  awarded by the trial judge are not supportable. The deduction of $5,767.83 on 
  account of the payment made by Mr. Pilzmaker to LLP's accountants was not pressed 
  by the appellant on this appeal. The claimed deduction of $494,865.07 is based 
  on the assertion that Mr. Pilzmaker, as a 12.5% equity shareholder in LLP, was 
  entitled to a 12.5% interest in the LLP funds transferred by him to Central 
  and, accordingly, LLP should not receive the benefit of a damages award for 
  funds legitimately received by Mr. Pilzmaker in his capacity as a minority shareholder. 
  Apart from the fact that this issue was not raised at trial, the appellant's 
  submission ignores the fact that shareholders in LLP were entitled to share 
  in LLP's funds only upon proper authorization by the company of a dividend. 
  No such dividend was authorized here. Moreover, when confronted with his wrongdoing, 
  Mr. Pilzmaker surrendered his LLP shares to LLP. His rights as a shareholder 
  of LLP ceased upon that surrender.</p>
<p>
  (4) Disposition</p>
<p>
  [14] For the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed. The respondent is entitled 
  to its costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis, fixed in the amount 
  of $17,500, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services Tax.</p>
