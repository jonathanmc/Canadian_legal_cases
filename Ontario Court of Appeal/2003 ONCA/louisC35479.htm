<p>The appellant, Jean Moise Jean Louis, appeals against the conviction imposed 
  by Justice Monique M&eacute;tivier of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting 
  with a jury, dated March 31, 2000, and against the sentence imposed by Justice 
  M&eacute;tivier, dated November 15, 2000. </p><p>
  BY THE COURT:</p><p>
  [1] The appellant was tried before a judge and jury on three counts of possession 
  of the proceeds of crime and one count of possession of narcotics for the purposes 
  of trafficking. At the close of the Crown's case, a directed verdict of acquittal 
  was entered with respect to a charge of possession of money obtained from crime 
  in relation to $278 found in the pocket of the appellant's jeans. In her charge 
  to the jury, the trial judge also directed a verdict of acquittal in relation 
  to $1,050 found in a safety deposit box in the appellant's name. The appellant 
  was convicted of possession of $1,700 knowing that the proceeds had been obtained 
  as a result of crime in relation to monies found in a linen closet in the apartment 
  he shared with his two co-accused. He was also convicted of possession of cocaine 
  for the purpose of trafficking in respect of 18.3 grams of crack cocaine found 
  in his bedroom in the same apartment. The appellant was sentenced to a term 
  of 22 months' imprisonment. He has served his sentence. </p><p>
  [2] The appellant appeals his convictions and applies for leave to appeal his 
  sentence. On the appeal against the convictions, the appellant raises three 
  grounds in respect of the trial judge's charge to the jury, and a fourth ground 
  alleging that the verdict was unreasonable. Counsel for the appellant quite 
  properly did not pursue the fourth ground of appeal in her oral submissions. 
  </p><p>
  [3] In our opinion, the trial judge's charge to the jury discloses three errors 
  in respect of items of evidence that were significant in the trial. Consequently, 
  we do not accept Crown counsel's submission that the curative proviso can be 
  applied. It is our view that a new trial must be ordered. </p><p>
  [4] The first error relates to the jury instructions on the co-conspirator's 
  exception to the hearsay rule established in R. v. Carter (1982), 31 C.R. (3d) 
  97 (S.C.C.). This rule became relevant because of the following evidence adduced 
  by the Crown. </p><p>
  [5] The search of the appellant's apartment was preceded by three cocaine buys 
  conducted by an undercover officer, Detective Tanguay, during the course of 
  the preceding month. These buys involved the appellant's co-accused but did 
  not involve the appellant. Although the appellant was not charged in relation 
  to any of the three transactions, the Crown adduced evidence purportedly linking 
  him to one of the transactions in an attempt to connect the appellant to a conspiracy 
  to traffic in drugs with the co-accused. The Crown's purpose in connecting the 
  appellant to the conspiracy was to have the jury consider a hearsay statement 
  made by one of the co-accused under the co-conspirator's exception to the hearsay 
  rule. The statement could arguably be taken as indicating that the appellant 
  was involved with the co-accused in drug trafficking and that, consequently, 
  it could be inferred that he had knowledge and control of the drugs and money 
  found in the apartment.</p><p>
  [6] In her initial charge to the jury on the use that could be made of the co-accused's 
  statement, the trial judge did not instruct the jury in accordance with the 
  first step in Carter. She did not tell the jury that before they could consider 
  the appellant's possible membership in the common enterprise (the second step 
  in Carter), they had to first consider whether, on all the evidence, they were 
  satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that a common enterprise to traffic into 
  drugs in fact existed. </p><p>
  [7] The trial judge also failed to instruct the jury in accordance with the 
  third step in Carter. She did not tell them that even if they were to conclude 
  that the appellant was a member of the conspiracy (in accordance with step two 
  of the Carter instruction) they could not conclude that he was guilty on that 
  basis alone, without further being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on all 
  the elements of the offences. In addition, the trial judge did not assist the 
  jury in any meaningful way as to what evidence could be considered at each step 
  of the Carter test as she was required to do.</p><p>
  [8] Both counsel objected to the charge. In her recharge to the jury, the trial 
  judge still omitted to charge the jury on the third step of the Carter instruction. 
  As well, the purported correction in respect of the first step was out of sequence 
  and confusing. </p><p>
  [9] In our view, the jury was not provided with the assistance that it needed 
  to properly consider this important item of evidence. </p><p>
  [10] The second error of significance relates to the trial judge's failure to 
  direct the jury on the frailties and inherent dangers of eyewitness identification. 
  During the search of the apartment, Detective Tanquay, upon seeing the appellant, 
  purportedly identified him as a person he had seen conducting surveillance during 
  one of the three undercover buys from the appellant's co-accused. The identification 
  in question was frail in many respects and also contradictory to some other 
  items of evidence. This identification, if accepted by the jury, was a potentially 
  significant piece of direct evidence linking the appellant to the common enterprise. 
  Further, Crown counsel stressed the importance of that evidence in his address 
  to the jury. </p><p>
  [11] The inherent frailties of eye witness identification are well-known to 
  the courts. Despite the lack of objection from counsel on this point, it is 
  our view that it was incumbent upon the trial judge to alert the jury to the 
  dangers of relying on this kind of evidence. </p><p>
  [12] The third error relates to the evidence that formed the subject-matter 
  of the directed verdicts of acquittal. While the evidence of the money found 
  in the appellant's jean pockets was of no consequence, the same cannot be said 
  of the $1,050 found in the safety deposit box. In view of the directed verdict 
  of acquittal, the correctness of which is not in issue before us, Crown counsel 
  concedes that the money could not be considered as proceeds of crime and that 
  its presence was therefore irrelevant to the remaining charges before the court. 
  While the trial judge referred to this evidence in her instructions, she gave 
  no instruction to the jury on the use that could be made of it. In our view, 
  it was incumbent upon the trial judge to direct the jury to disregard this evidence. 
  </p><p>
  [13] Accordingly the appeal is allowed, the conviction is set aside and a new 
  trial is ordered.</p>
