<p>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Robert A. Blair R.S.J., Maria 
  T. Linhares De Sousa J., and Denis J. Power J.) dated January 16, 2002.</p><p>
  LASKIN J.A.:</p><p>
  A. Introduction</p><p>
  [1] This appeal raises the general question whether a collective bargaining 
  regime precludes individual bargaining of the terms or conditions of employment.</p><p>
  [2] The appellant, Loyalist College, and the respondent, OPSEU, are parties 
  to a collective agreement covering academic employees of the College, including 
  teachers. Ms. Sherri Bergman applied for a job as a full-time teacher in the 
  College's Early Childhood Education program. The College offered her the job 
  on the condition that she pursue a graduate program in her field of study. She 
  agreed to the condition and was given the job. However, ten months into her 
  one-year probationary period Ms. Bergman had still not enrolled in a graduate 
  program. The College then fired her. </p>
<p> [3] She grieved her firing. The majority of the Arbitration Board upheld her 
  grievance and ordered that she be reinstated.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> The majority 
  concluded that the condition of Ms. Bergman's hiring was invalid because the 
  law prohibited a unionized employer and an employee from negotiating a condition 
  of employment. Alternatively, the majority concluded that the condition was 
  invalid because it conflicted with the collective agreement. </p>
<p>
  [4] In a brief endorsement, the Divisional Court dismissed the College's application 
  for judicial review. The College now appeals, with leave, to this court. Its 
  appeal raises these four issues:</p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Is the appropriate standard of review of the Board's 
  decision correctness or patent unreasonableness?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Did the Board commit a reviewable error in concluding 
  that the condition of Ms. Bergman's employment was invalid because the law prohibits 
  a unionized employer from bargaining conditions of employment with an individual 
  employee? </p>
<p class="indent">3. Alternatively, did the Board commit a reviewable 
  error in concluding that the condition was invalid because it conflicted with 
  the collective agreement? </p>
<p class="indent">4. Did the Board have jurisdiction to entertain the 
  grievance of a probationary employee? </p>
<p>
  [5] For the reasons that follow I would dismiss the appeal.</p><p>
  B. Background Facts</p><p>
  [6] For eight years Sherri Bergman had been a sessional and part-time teacher 
  in the College's Early Childhood Education program. Her qualifications included 
  a Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in psychology, from York University, and 
  a Bachelor of Education and a diploma in Child Studies from the Institute of 
  Child Study in Toronto. </p><p>
  [7] In the spring of 1999, Ms. Bergman applied for a full-time teaching position. 
  The College's selection committee interviewed six applicants. The committee 
  selected Ms. Bergman on the condition that after she was hired she would do 
  graduate work (a Master's Degree) in her field of study.</p><p>
  [8] The president of the College formally offered Ms. Bergman the job in a letter 
  dated July 14, 1999, which read in part:</p>
<p class="indent"> I am writing to confirm, subject to a recent satisfactory 
  medical report, our offer of employment as a Professor at Loyalist College commencing 
  August 23, 1999.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; </p>
<p class="indent">The general terms of employment will be as outlined 
  in the Collective Agreement and your annual salary at Step 14 will be $59,228.00. 
  Please be aware that your probationary period will be one (1) year. </p>
<p class="indent">Your appointment is also based on the expectation that 
  you will continue to pursue professional development in the ECE field or education 
  through the Institute of Child Study or similar professional organization or 
  graduate school. This will be further discussed with you by Dean K. Smith when 
  you establish your annual objective. </p>
<p>
  Ms. Bergman signed the letter, thus agreeing to its terms. OPSEU was not consulted.</p><p>
  [9] The president's letter speaks of an &quot;expectation,&quot; not a &quot;condition,&quot; 
  that Ms. Bergman pursue professional development. In this court, both sides 
  raised the question whether the two words carried different legal consequences. 
  I attach no significance to the use of the word &quot;expectation&quot; for 
  two reasons. First, as I will discuss, in his termination letter the president 
  used the word &quot;condition&quot;; and second, the Board found that the College 
  had imposed a condition on Ms. Bergman's hiring, a finding I accept. I therefore 
  approach this appeal on the footing that, as a condition of her employment, 
  Ms. Bergman was required to enrol in a graduate program in Early Childhood Education 
  or in a related field. </p><p>
  [10] She did not, however, immediately do so. Her appointment was effective 
  August 23, 1999. She was assigned and taught a full course load, and the College 
  evaluated her teaching in &quot;very favourable&quot; terms. But several times 
  over the year the College reminded Ms. Bergman that she had yet to fulfil a 
  condition of her employment. In April 2000, she told the College that she was 
  then &quot;in the process of applying to take a Master's Degree&quot;. By mid 
  May she still had not done so, prompting the College on May 18, 2000, to advise 
  her in writing that she had until the end of May to show that she had complied. 
  She did not do so.</p><p>
  [11] On June 20, 2000, the president wrote Ms. Bergman telling her the College 
  would not be appointing her to a full-time faculty position. Instead she was 
  told that her employment would terminate at the end of the month. The president 
  gave a single reason for her dismissal: her failure to satisfy the condition 
  of her employment.</p>
<p class="indent"> Dear Sherri:</p>
<p class="indent">This letter is to advise you that, unfortunately the 
  College will not be appointing you to a full-time faculty position. You will 
  remain on staff until the end of June 2000 and then you will receive 90 days 
  pay in lieu of notice plus your earned vacation. </p>
<p class="indent">This decision, made during your probationary period, 
  was not reached lightly, and it is based on the fact that you have not fulfilled 
  the conditions outlined in your letter of appointment concerning pursuing professional 
  development in Adult Education or Early Childhood Education at the Master's 
  level. </p>
<p>
  [12] Ms. Bergman was accepted into a graduate program on July 28, 2000, nearly 
  a month before her probationary period would have ended. Her grievance, which 
  she signed on June 28, 2000, went before the Board of Arbitration in November 
  2000.</p><p>
  [13] I turn to the issues on the appeal.</p><p>
  C. Discussion</p><p>
  First Issue: Is the appropriate standard of review of the Board's decision correctness 
  or patent unreasonableness?</p><p>
  [14] As on most appeals of judicial review applications, a threshold question 
  on this appeal is the appropriate standard for reviewing the decision of the 
  Board of Arbitration. The College says the appropriate standard is correctness, 
  or perhaps reasonableness; OPSEU says patent unreasonableness.</p><p>
  [15] The Board rested its decision to allow the grievance and reinstate Ms. 
  Bergman on either of two findings: first, the condition of her hiring was invalid 
  in law, regardless of whether it contradicted the collective agreement; or second, 
  the condition was invalid because it contradicted the collective agreement. 
  I therefore consider it appropriate in this case to consider the standard of 
  review separately for each finding. See Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Canada 
  (Labour Relations Board), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 157.</p><p>
  [16] I begin with the second finding. For that finding the standard of review 
  must certainly be patent unreasonableness.</p><p>
  [17] Under s. 84 (1) of the Colleges Collective Bargaining Act, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. C.15, (the &quot;Act&quot;) the decision of the Arbitration Board is protected 
  by a full privative clause, a clause that on its face precludes an appeal and 
  any form of judicial review. See Pasiechnyk v. Saskatchewan (Workers' Compensation 
  Board), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 890. Section 84(1) provides:</p>
<p class="indent"> 84(1) No decision, order, determination, direction, 
  declaration or ruling of the Commission, a fact finder, an arbitrator or board 
  of arbitration, a selector or the Ontario Labour Relations Board shall be questioned 
  or reviewed in any court, and no order shall be made or process entered, or 
  proceedings taken in any court, whether by way of injunction, declaratory judgment, 
  certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, application for judicial review 
  or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit or restrain the Commission, fact 
  finder, arbitrator or board of arbitration, selector or the Ontario Labour Relations 
  Board or the proceedings of any of them. </p>
<p>
  [18] Since its decision in Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 963 v. New 
  Brunswick Liquor Corp. (1979), 97 D.L.R. (3d) 417 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court 
  has consistently held that for matters within a tribunal's jurisdiction, a full 
  privative clause reflects the legislature's intent to limit review to patently 
  unreasonable errors, unless other factors strongly point to a less deferential 
  standard. See United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, Local 
  579 v. Bradco Construction Ltd., [1993] 2 S.C.R. 316, CBC v. Canada, supra, 
  and Pushpanathan v. Canada (M.C.I.), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982. </p><p>
  [19] The most important of these other factors is, of course, the relative expertise 
  of the Board on the issue before it. And in the present case this factor, too, 
  supports a highly deferential standard. Whether the condition of Ms. Bergman's 
  hiring contradicted the collective agreement is the kind of issue labour arbitrators 
  often have to decide and on which they have a great deal of expertise. </p><p>
  [20] That brings me to the appropriate standard of review on the first and main 
  finding of the Board, that the condition was invalid because the College could 
  not legally bargain this condition with an individual employee. Despite the 
  existence of the privative clause in s. 84(1) of the Act, the College argues 
  for a standard of correctness for review of this finding. It relies on the well 
  reasoned judgment of my colleague Doherty J.A. in City of Toronto v. CUPE, Local 
  79 (2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 541 (C.A.). In that case an employee grieved his dismissal 
  by the City after he had been convicted of sexual assault. One of the questions 
  this court had to decide was the standard of review of the arbitrator's decision 
  that the union could relitigate the employee's culpability. Doherty J.A. concluded 
  that the appropriate standard was correctness. The arbitrator's decision turned 
  on his understanding of the common law rules and principles governing the relitigation 
  of issues decided in previous judicial proceedings. Neither the statute nor 
  the collective agreement suggested that either the legislature or the parties 
  intended the court to defer to the arbitrator's view of the common law. </p><p>
  [21] In the case before us the College similarly submits that in holding the 
  condition of Ms. Bergman's hiring was invalid, the Arbitration Board had to 
  interpret four Supreme Court of Canada cases a task for which it had no greater 
  expertise than a court. It seems to me, however, that this case and the City 
  of Toronto case differ on three relevant points. These differences justify applying 
  the patently unreasonable standard of review to the Board's conclusion that 
  the condition was invalid and could not be individually bargained. </p><p>
  [22] First, in City of Toronto the arbitrator was protected by a limited privative 
  clause. In this case the Board is protected by a full privative clause. Second, 
  in City of Toronto the arbitrator had to interpret the common law. In this case, 
  although the Board had to consider the Supreme Court of Canada's jurisprudence 
  on pre-employment conditions, it also had to consider the Act and the recognition 
  clause in the collective agreement, both matters on which its expertise was 
  engaged. Third, in City of Toronto, as Doherty J.A. pointed out, not only was 
  the question at issue one of law alone, it was also one of general significance 
  that reached into many areas of the law. In this case the question at issue 
  may be one of law alone, but it has no significance outside the labour relations 
  context. </p><p>
  [23] In sum, the Board's decision is protected by a full privative clause; the 
  Board had to decide a narrow question of law limited to the field of labour 
  relations; and the question engaged the Board's expertise. All of these considerations 
  point to the patently unreasonable standard of review of the Board's decision 
  on the invalidity of the condition. But as I will discuss, I would not interfere 
  with the Board's decision on this issue even if the appropriate standard were 
  correctness. </p><p>
  Second Issue: Did the Board commit a reviewable error in concluding that the 
  condition of Ms. Bergman's employment was invalid because the law prohibits 
  a unionized employer from bargaining conditions of employment with an individual 
  employee?</p><p>
  [24] The main issue on this appeal concerns the validity of the condition that 
  Ms. Bergman enrol in a graduate program during her probationary year. On the 
  record before us, Ms. Bergman complied with the condition because she registered 
  in a Master's program nearly a month before what would have been the end of 
  her probationary period. By then, however, she had already been dismissed. </p><p>
  [25] The Board did not need to deal with the effect of Ms. Bergman's registration 
  because it concluded that the condition was invalid in law. Central to the Board's 
  conclusion were s. 52 of the Act and Article 1.01 of the collective agreement, 
  both of which explicitly provide that OPSEU is &quot;the exclusive bargaining 
  agent&quot; for all employees covered by the collective agreement. In the Board's 
  opinion, because of s. 52 of the Act and Article 1.01 of the agreement, &quot;[t]he 
  union alone, to the exclusion of the individual employee, has the legal authority 
  to negotiate terms and conditions of employment on behalf of everyone in the 
  bargaining unit.&quot; </p><p>
  [26] The Board interpreted the four Supreme Court of Canada cases that consider 
  this issue to stand for the proposition that only the act of hiring - &quot;the 
  employer's bare offer of the job and the employee's acceptance of the offer&quot; 
  - could be individually negotiated. Even accepting that the condition of Ms. 
  Bergman's hiring was not included in the collective agreement, the Board still 
  held that it was invalid. In the Board's words, &quot;[b]ecause the individual 
  employee does not have the authority to negotiate terms and conditions of employment, 
  the product of the attempt is invalid, even on matters the union and the employer 
  omitted from the collective agreement.&quot;</p><p>
  [27] The College contends that the Board erred in concluding that the condition 
  was invalid. It submits that it is entitled to negotiate directly with individual 
  employees those pre-employment conditions not covered by the collective agreement. 
  The College makes three arguments in support of its submission. First, the College 
  argues that the Board misinterpreted the Supreme Court of Canada's jurisprudence 
  on the scope for individual bargaining of conditions of employment. Second, 
  it argues that the employer's management rights - enshrined in Article 6.01 
  of the collective agreement - entitled it to impose this condition on Ms. Bergman's 
  hiring. Indeed, the College says it treated Ms. Bergman fairly by raising the 
  question of graduate work before she was hired instead of afterwards. Third, 
  the College argues that this court's decision in Johnston v. Dresser Industries 
  Canada Ltd. (1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 609 supports the validity of this pre employment 
  condition. I will address each of these arguments. </p><p>
  [28] The College argues that the Supreme Court's case law does not foreclose 
  the possibility of individual bargaining of terms and conditions of employment. 
  The four relevant Supreme Court of Canada decisions are: Syndicat Catholique 
  des Employ&eacute;es v. Compagnie Paquet (1959), 18 D.L.R. (2d) 346 (S.C.C.); 
  CPR v. Zambri (1962), 34 D.L.R. (2d) 654 (S.C.C.); McGavin Toastmaster Ltd. 
  v. Ainscough (1975), 54 D.L.R. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.); and Paccar of Canada Ltd. v. 
  CAIMAW (1989), 62 D.L.R. (4th) 437. </p><p>
  [29] The foundation case is Paquet, in which the Court concluded that a collective 
  agreement could provide for the compulsory deduction of union dues from the 
  wages of all employees, even without their consent. Judson J. wrote that compulsory 
  deduction was a condition of employment and, once agreed to by the employer 
  and the union, became just as &quot;regulatory of the employer/employee relationship 
  as any other clause in the agreement.&quot; Judson J. continued at pp. 353-4 
  in a passage relied on by the Board and by both parties to this appeal.</p>
<p class="indent"> The union is&#133; the representative of all the employees 
  in the unit for the purpose of negotiating the labour agreement. There is no 
  room left for private negotiations between employer and employee. Certainly 
  to the extent of the matters covered by the collective agreement, freedom of 
  contract between master and individual servant is abrogated. The collective 
  agreement tells the employer on what terms he must in the future conduct his 
  master and servant relations. When this collective agreement was made, it then 
  became the duty of the employer to modify his contracts of employment in accordance 
  with its terms so far as the inclusion of those terms is authorized by the governing 
  statutes. The terms of employment are defined for all employees, and whether 
  or not they are members of the union, they are identical for all. </p>
<p>
  [30] The words of Judson J. are significant for this appeal in at least two 
  ways. As he points out, all similarly situated employees in a bargaining unit 
  are governed by identical terms of employment. Here, we have no evidence that 
  the College required all those in Ms. Bergman's position to pursue graduate 
  work. Subjecting her to a different condition of employment is antithetical 
  to the notion of collective bargaining. Indeed, employers are ordinarily prohibited 
  from bargaining directly with employees because permitting employers to do so 
  would allow them to &quot;divide and conquer,&quot; to play one employee off 
  against another and, thus, defeat union solidarity. </p><p>
  [31] The passage from Paquet also confirms that a condition determining whether 
  an employee retains his or her job is a condition of employment. And conditions 
  of employment that govern job retention must be in the collective agreement. 
  The condition of Ms. Bergman's hiring, which the College relied on to dismiss 
  her, was not in this collective agreement.</p><p>
  [32] Nonetheless, the College draws support for its position from this sentence 
  in the passage from Paquet: &quot;Certainly to the extent of the matters covered 
  by the collective agreement, freedom of contract between master and individual 
  servant is abrogated.&quot; The College submits that precisely because the requirement 
  for doing graduate work was not in the collective agreement it could legally 
  negotiate this condition directly with Ms. Bergman. In the context of the entire 
  passage, I do not think this one sentence can be taken to sanction individual 
  bargaining of a condition, which, if breached, could result in the loss of a 
  job.</p><p>
  [33] Moreover, whatever small scope for individual bargaining Judson J. left 
  open in Paquet he seems to have narrowed in Zambri, in which the Supreme Court 
  held that striking employees are still protected by the collective agreement. 
  Judson J. wrote at 666:</p>
<p class="indent"> When a collective agreement had expired, it is difficult 
  to see how there can be anything left to govern the employer-employee relationship. 
  Conversely, when there is a collective agreement in effect, it is difficult 
  to see how there can be anything left outside, except possibly the act of hiring 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [34] The Board reasonably relied on this last sentence to hold that individual 
  bargaining of anything more than the bare offer and acceptance of a job would 
  be invalid. </p><p>
  [35] Judson J.'s reasoning in Paquet and Zambri was affirmed by the Supreme 
  Court in McGavin Toastmaster, another case dealing with the rights of striking 
  employees. After referring to Paquet, Laskin C.J.C. wrote at p. 6:</p>
<p class="indent"> The reality is, and has been for many years now throughout 
  Canada, that individual relationships as between employer and employee have 
  meaning only at the hiring stage and even then there are qualifications which 
  arise by reason of union security clauses in collective agreements. The common 
  law as it applies to individual employment contracts is no longer relevant to 
  employer-employee relations governed by a collective agreement which, as the 
  one involved here, deals with discharge, termination of employment, severance 
  pay and a host of other matters that have been negotiated between union and 
  the company as the principal parties thereto. </p>
<p>
  [36] Finally, in Paccar, La Forest J. writing for two of the four member majority 
  of the court, found reasonable an arbitration board's conclusion that under 
  a collective bargaining regime, individual employees have no authority to negotiate 
  on their own behalf; only the union can negotiate and, &quot;[i]n these circumstances, 
  it does not make sense to speak of individual contracts of employment at any 
  time.&quot;</p><p>
  [37] What then does one take from these four cases? Admittedly, as the College 
  argued, in none of them does the Supreme Court expressly prohibit individual 
  bargaining of a condition of employment not covered by the collective agreement. 
  In these cases, however, the Court emphasized the sanctity of the collective 
  bargaining regime and the role of the union as the representative of all employees 
  in the bargaining unit. The Court thus affirmed the principle that the collective 
  agreement, not individual negotiation, should govern the employment relationship 
  in a unionized workplace. Permitting an employer to negotiate directly with 
  an employee a term or condition of continued employment conflicts with this 
  principle. Therefore, it seems to me that the reasoning in the four Supreme 
  Court of Canada cases precludes individual bargaining of a condition whose non-fulfilment 
  could lead to dismissal. </p><p>
  [38] I think the jurisprudence on this question is fairly summarized by Brown 
  and Beatty's Canadian Labour Arbitration, 3d ed. (Toronto: Canada Law Book, 
  2002) at para. 2:1210.</p>
<p class="indent"> It has long been established that individual employment 
  relationships have meaning only at the hiring stage and that the individual 
  employee's bargaining rights over terms and conditions of employment are pre-empted 
  by a collective bargaining relationship&#133; The only scope for individual 
  bargaining with regard to terms and conditions of employment would appear to 
  be where it is sanctioned by the collective agreement, by the collective bargaining 
  agent, where it is ancillary to routine administration of the collective agreement, 
  where the terms fall outside the scope of the agreement, such as an agreement 
  concerning an early retirement arrangement or reimbursement for relocation expenses, 
  or in some cases where there is a voluntary waiver of a collective agreement 
  benefit that does not undermine the collective agreement [footnotes omitted; 
  emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [39] In the case before us, the condition of Ms. Bergman's hiring was not sanctioned 
  by the collective agreement and was not ancillary to the routine administration 
  of the agreement. Nor, in my view, was it a term outside the scope of the agreement 
  that might be individually bargained. Instead, it was a term that went to the 
  core of Ms. Bergman's continued employment. Based on the Supreme Court of Canada's 
  case law, the Board correctly held that the condition of Ms. Bergman's employment 
  was invalid. </p><p>
  [40] The College also relies on its exclusive right to manage the institution 
  provided for in Article 6.01 of the collective agreement. The College points 
  out that many incidents of the employment relationship - for example, teaching 
  schedules and subjects taught - are not, nor realistically could be, set down 
  in the collective agreement. The College, as employer, has the right to make 
  decisions in these areas.</p><p>
  [41] I accept that the College's right to manage gives it authority to impose 
  its will on a myriad of matters not expressly dealt with in the collective agreement. 
  But on a matter as important as a condition of employment, the breach of which 
  can result in dismissal, the College cannot rely on its management rights. In 
  Ms. Bergman's case, it either had to negotiate the condition of her hiring with 
  the union or, as the Board pointed out, to require graduate study as a qualification 
  for being hired in the first place. </p><p>
  [42] The College contends that in making graduate study a condition of her hiring 
  it was being fair to Ms. Bergman, fairer than, for example, hiring her and then 
  insisting that she do a Master's degree if she wished to become a full-time 
  professor. This contention, however, is two-edged. The seeming fairness of apprising 
  Ms. Bergman at the outset of the need to do graduate work evaporated because 
  the College held her failure to comply against her even though it evaluated 
  her teaching abilities favourably. Also, sanctioning the validity of a condition 
  as important as that of Ms. Bergman's hiring risks opening a Pandora's box of 
  side deals between employers and employees that could undermine the collective 
  bargaining regime.</p><p>
  [43] Still, the College maintains that this court's decision in Dresser supports 
  the validity of the condition of Ms. Bergman's hiring. To me, however, Dresser 
  is an entirely different case. In Dresser, the employer induced six employees 
  to leave secure jobs in England by promising them at least two years employment 
  in Canada. However, Dresser's business took a downturn, and before the two years 
  were up, it laid off the six employees under the seniority provisions of the 
  collective agreement. On these compelling facts, the trial judge found that 
  these six employees had entered into pre-employment contracts, which were enforceable 
  in the courts despite the existence of the collective agreement. As the employer 
  had breached the contracts, the employees were entitled to damages. This court 
  upheld the trial judge's decision.</p><p>
  [44] The College submits that just as this court upheld the validity of the 
  pre-employment contracts in Dresser, so too should it uphold the validity of 
  the hiring condition in this case. I consider that Dresser and this case differ 
  in two material ways. First, in Dresser, this court upheld the finding of a 
  separate, stand-alone pre employment contract, outside the scope of the collective 
  agreement. In this case the condition of Ms. Bergman's hiring did not amount 
  to a separate pre employment contract outside the agreement, but instead, as 
  I have said earlier, was a condition of her continued employment under the agreement. 
  Second, in Dresser, the employees, who were not parties to the collective agreement, 
  sought to enforce their contractual rights in the court. In this case the party 
  seeking to rely on the condition, the College, was a party to the collective 
  agreement, and was subject to its terms, not in a court, but before a board 
  of arbitration. Dresser does not assist the College. </p><p>
  [45] In my opinion, the Board did not commit a reviewable error in concluding 
  that the condition of Ms. Bergman's employment was invalid because the law prohibits 
  a unionized employer from bargaining conditions with an individual employee. 
  The Board's conclusion was not patently unreasonable. Indeed, in my view the 
  Board's conclusion was correct. On either standard of review, I see no basis 
  to interfere. </p><p>
  Third Issue: Did the Board commit a reviewable error in concluding that the 
  condition of Ms. Bergman's employment was invalid because it conflicted with 
  the collective agreement?</p><p>
  [46] Although the Board concluded that the condition of Ms. Bergman's hiring 
  was invalid in law, the Board also considered whether the condition was invalid 
  because it conflicted with the agreement. And the Board concluded that the condition 
  of Ms. Bergman's employment - that she pursue graduate work in her field of 
  study - did conflict. </p><p>
  [47] The College submits that the Board committed a reviewable error in finding 
  a conflict between the hiring condition and Article 27.02C. The College argues 
  that the requirement to do graduate work was not covered by the collective agreement. 
  Matters not expressly included in a collective agreement cannot contradict it 
  and, therefore, can be negotiated directly with individual employees. The College 
  contends that it did not act unfairly or in bad faith in telling Ms. Bergman 
  that she could teach at the College as long as she had a graduate degree and 
  that she should enrol in a graduate program during her probationary year. </p><p>
  [48] The College's submission is premised on the principle that a unionized 
  employer and an employee can negotiate conditions of continued employment that 
  are not expressly included in a collective agreement. I have already rejected 
  this principle. Nonetheless, even accepting the principle, the Board's conclusion 
  that the condition contradicted the collective agreement was reasonable. </p><p>
  [49] The Board examined &quot;the language and scheme&quot; of Article 27.02C 
  of the collective agreement, which was the provision dealing with probationary 
  employees. Article 27.02C provided: </p>
<p class="indent"> 27.02C During the probationary period an employee will 
  be informed in writing of the employee's progress at intervals of four months 
  continuous employment or four months of accumulated non-continuous employment 
  and a copy given to the employee. Also, it is understood that an employee may 
  be released during the first five months of continuous or non-continuous accumulated 
  employment following the commencement date of the employee's employment upon 
  at least 30 calendar days' written notice and during the remainder of the employee's 
  probationary period upon at lease 90 calendar days' written notice. If requested 
  by the employee, the reason for such release will be given in writing. </p>
<p>
  [50] In the Board's opinion, this provision was &quot;designed to allow the 
  teacher to attempt any desirable improvement as the probationary period goes 
  on. If the academic administrators are dissatisfied with the 'progress,' the 
  College may release the teacher upon written notice of stated length.&quot; 
  The condition of Ms. Bergman's hiring, in the Board's view, contradicted the 
  scheme and purpose of Article 27.02C because it added a ground for her release 
  not found in the collective agreement: &quot;no matter how well Bergman did 
  the job as teacher and performed generally as a member of the program and of 
  the faculty the condition allows the College to release her if she had not at 
  least enrolled in ECE graduate study by August 23, 2000.&quot;</p><p>
  [51] The Board's finding of a conflict between the condition and the collective 
  agreement makes good sense. The Board viewed Article 27.02C in the light of 
  labour arbitrators' understanding of the traditional purpose of a probationary 
  period: to assess the employee's on the job performance. Under clause 27.02C 
  a probationary employee received progress reports at four month intervals, which 
  were intended to allow the employee to redress any shortcomings in his or her 
  job performance. That, in substance, was the deal made by the College and OPSEU. 
  Although not expressly contradicting Article 27.02C, the hiring condition implicitly 
  conflicted with it and with its purposes. This condition added to and, thus, 
  undermined the deal made between the College and OPSEU. </p><p>
  [52] The standard of review of the Board's conclusion on this issue is patent 
  unreasonableness. I have found that the Board's conclusion is reasonable. It 
  is therefore not patently unreasonable. Accordingly, I would not give effect 
  to the College's submission on this issue. </p><p>
  Fourth Issue: Did the Board have jurisdiction to entertain Ms. Bergman's grievance?</p><p>
  [53] The Act contains a provision - s. 46(1) - which, like s. 45(1) of the Labour 
  Relations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.2, requires that every collective agreement 
  provide for the arbitration of all differences between the parties, including 
  whether a matter is arbitrable. Section 46(1) states:</p>
<p class="indent"> 46(1) Every agreement shall provide for the final and 
  binding settlement by arbitration of all differences between an employer and 
  the employee organization arising from the interpretation, application, administration 
  or alleged contravention of the agreement including any question as to whether 
  a matter is arbitrable.</p>
<p class="indent">Articles 32.03 and 32.04 of the collective agreement 
  between the College and OPSEU provided for arbitration in the terms required 
  by the Act, if a difference between the parties had not been satisfactorily 
  resolved by the prescribed grievance procedures. </p>
<p>
  [54] However, Article 32.06 of the collective agreement on its face precluded 
  a probationary employee from grieving his or her dismissal.</p>
<p class="indent"> 32.06 It being understood that the dismissal of an 
  employee during the probationary period shall not be the subject of a grievance, 
  an employee who has completed the probationary period may lodge a grievance 
  in the manner set out in 32.07 and 32.08.</p>
<p>
  [55] In the light of this provision, the College submits that the Board of Arbitration 
  should not have entertained Ms. Bergman's grievance. I do not accept this submission. 
  In my view, the Board had jurisdiction to deal with the grievance.</p><p>
  [56] Admittedly, the Board did not expressly address its jurisdiction over Ms. 
  Bergman's grievance, perhaps because as the Divisional Court noted &quot;the 
  arbitration proceeded on the basis that the Board would address the issue of 
  the 'condition' of employment.&quot; But the Board, nonetheless, implicitly 
  assumed jurisdiction and it was correct to do so.</p><p>
  [57] The question of the Board's jurisdiction to hear the grievance brings into 
  play two competing principles. The first principle is that, generally, arbitrators 
  cannot review the merits of an employer's decision to dismiss a probationary 
  employee. The second principle, a qualification on the first, is that arbitrators 
  may be entitled to review an employer's decision to dismiss a probationary employee 
  if the decision is made in bad faith or is based on a illegal or invalid consideration. 
  Both principles are reflected in this collective agreement and the governing 
  statute, the Colleges Collective Bargaining Act. The application of the second 
  principle clothed the Board with jurisdiction to hear Ms. Bergman's grievance 
  because her dismissal was based on an invalid consideration, namely, the condition 
  of her continuing employment. </p><p>
  [58] Probationary employees are typically thought of as serving a period of 
  apprenticeship. During this period employers expect wider latitude in their 
  decisions to dismiss new employees judged not suitable for continued employment. 
  Thus, ordinarily probationary employees cannot expect the protection of the 
  just cause provision enjoyed by those employees who have completed their probationary 
  period. See Re Nordair Inc. v. International Association of Machinists and Aerospace 
  Workers Lodge 2309 (1985), 22 L.A.C. (3d) 177; Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. 
  Canadian Union of Public Employees, [1995] C.L.A.D. No. 57.</p><p>
  [59] Ms. Bergman was in this position. The collective agreement between the 
  College and OPSEU entitled the College to terminate Ms. Bergman's employment 
  without cause. Article 27.02C, to which I have referred, provided that a probationary 
  employee may be released during the first five months of employment on 30 days 
  written notice and, during the remainder of the probationary period, on at least 
  90 days written notice. This notice requirement affirmed that the College could 
  dismiss a probationary employee without cause. Taken together, Articles 27.02C 
  and 32.06 precluded an arbitrator from entertaining a probationary employee's 
  claim that he or she was dismissed without just cause. That claim could not 
  become a &quot;difference&quot; arising from the application or contravention 
  of the agreement and, therefore, it would not be arbitrable.</p><p>
  [60] Nonetheless, the College did not have an unfettered right to dismiss probationary 
  employees. Although the collective agreement did not give probationary employees 
  the right to just cause for dismissal, it did give them other limited rights. 
  An alleged breach of any of these rights may give rise to a difference in the 
  interpretation, application or administration of the collective agreement, and 
  failing resolution, would then be arbitrable. See Re Ontario Hydro v. Ontario 
  Hydro Employees' Union Local 1000 (1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 669 (C.A.).</p>
<p> [61] So, for example, one right of a probationary employee was the right not 
  to be discriminated against on the various grounds prescribed in Article 4.01. 
  <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> Another right was the right not to be dismissed in bad 
  faith. For many years arbitrators and courts have held that this right is an 
  implied term of every collective agreement and extends to all employees, including 
  probationary employees. See Brampton Hydro Electric Commission v. C.A.W., Local 
  1285 (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 773 (Ont. Div. Ct) and Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) 
  v. Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 43 (unreported, July 3, 1981, Div. 
  Crt).</p>
<p>
  [62] Here, however, the Board did not make a finding that the College discriminated 
  against Ms. Bergman or acted in bad faith in dismissing her. Although OPSEU 
  urged this court to make a finding of bad faith, I think it inappropriate to 
  do so on appeal, at least on the record before us.</p><p>
  [63] However, just as the College could not dismiss a probationary employee 
  in bad faith, neither could it dismiss a probationary employee by relying on 
  a condition of employment that was illegal or conflicted with the collective 
  agreement. Article 32.06 assumes that the College will act lawfully. The parties 
  could not have intended otherwise. Moreover, this assumption underlying Article 
  32.06 was reinforced by Article 6.02, which provided that the College had a 
  duty to exercise its management functions consistently with the terms of the 
  collective agreement. Article 32.06 did not empower the College to do what it 
  did to Ms. Bergman: ground her dismissal on the breach of a condition that was 
  either unlawful or contradicted the collective agreement. </p>
<p> [64] The College could have properly dismissed Ms. Bergman for reasons related 
  to her suitability for the job.<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> What the College could not 
  do was rely on its own prohibited conduct to dismiss her. The College's reliance 
  on a condition that was either unlawful or in conflict with the collective agreement 
  entitled Ms. Bergman to grieve her dismissal. Accordingly, the Board of Arbitration 
  had jurisdiction to entertain the grievance under the arbitration provisions 
  of the collective agreement and s. 46 of the Act. I would therefore not give 
  effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  D. Conclusion</p><p>
  [65] I would dismiss the appeal with costs in the amount agreed to by the parties, 
  $8,000. </p>
