<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice Michael H. Caney, of the 
  Ontario Court of Justice, on November 15, 2000 and an appeal from the disposition 
  imposed on R. B. on March 27, 2001.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
  
<p>[1] The appellants were convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to one 
  year in secure custody followed by a period of probation. L.P. appeals conviction 
  only. R.B. appeals conviction and disposition. A third accused, K.H., was acquitted.</p>
<p>The Conviction Appeals</p>
  <p>[2] The appellants and K.H. associated with a group of boys who called themselves 
  SHA. The victim, Jonathon Wamback, associated with another group who called 
  themselves T. K. On the day of the assault, the appellants and others in their 
  group came to believe that Jonathon Wamback had painted racial slurs on the 
  washroom wall in a park frequented by both groups. K.H. is black. Some members 
  of SHA confronted Jonathon outside the washroom but eventually let him go. The 
  appellants, K.J and two others decided to look for Jonathon and eventually confronted 
  him in a yard in a nearby house. That confrontation became violent. L.P. punched 
  Jonathon in the head area, knocking him toward the ground. As Jonathon was falling 
  L.P. struck him with his fist in the head area two more times. Jonathon was 
  lying on the ground in a fetal position with his hands covering his head when 
  R.B. directed a kick at Jonathon's head using a motion akin to that used when 
  punting a football.</p>
  <p>[3] Jonathon got up after he was kicked and left the area, eventually making 
  his way to his home. He did not appear to be hurt. As the night went on, Jonathon 
  developed neurological symptoms and had to be rushed to the hospital. Life saving 
  surgery was performed on Jonathon in the early hours of the next morning. He 
  had suffered a depressed fracture of the skull on the right side of the head. 
  There was considerable swelling within the skull following the operation. Jonathon 
  was on life support after the operation and remained in a coma for several months. 
  Fortunately, his condition has improved but he remains significantly neurologically 
  impaired.</p>
  <p>[4] In the days following the assault L.P. admitted to friends that he had punched 
  Jonathon in the head and knocked him to the ground. R.B. admitted to those same 
  friends that he had directed a kick at Jonathon's head while Jonathan was lying 
  on the ground with his hands over his head. </p>
  <p>[5] Neither appellant testified at trial.</p>
  <p>[6] On appeal, both counsel concede that the appellants were properly convicted 
  of assault but they argue that the convictions for aggravated assault cannot 
  stand.</p>
  <p>[7] The appellants submit that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence going 
  to the question of causation. They refer to one paragraph in the trial judge's 
  reasons where they submit the trial judge listed possible causes of the injury. 
  They contend that there was no evidence to support at least two of the possibilities 
  listed by the trial judge. He did not find that either of these possibilities 
  had in fact occurred. </p>
  <p>[8] We find no misapprehension of the evidence. A review of the entirety of 
  the reasons demonstrates that the trial judge had a full appreciation of the 
  expert evidence as to causation and that he understood the relatively narrow 
  differences between the opinions advanced by the two experts. The impugned passage 
  was no more than an indication that none of the possible causes of the injury 
  could be determined with &quot;scientific certainty&quot;. No one questions 
  this conclusion. </p>
  <p>[9] Even if it could be said that one or more of the causes listed as possibilities 
  by the trial judge were not legitimate possibilities on the evidence, that misapprehension 
  would in no way taint the trial judge's conclusion that the injuries were caused 
  in the course of the assault by the appellants. On the expert evidence, the 
  injuries could have been caused by the assault or they could have been caused 
  by a fall on to a hard protruding object. The experts also agreed that the symptoms 
  could have taken up to twelve hours to manifest themselves.</p>
  <p>[10] The trial judge had to consider the expert evidence as to causation in 
  combination with the evidence of the witnesses who testified as to what had 
  happened to Jonathon Wamback on the night in question. The trial judge referred 
  at some length to all of the evidence. It was up to him to decide based on the 
  entirety of that evidence whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
  that the injuries were caused by the assault. We think it was open to him to 
  find that the assault, which both experts agreed could have caused the injury, 
  in fact did cause the injury and that on the entirety of the evidence, a fall, 
  the other possible cause identified by the experts, was not a &quot;realistic 
  possibility&quot;. We do not read the reasons as placing any onus on the appellants 
  to explain the injuries but rather read them as considering whether on the evidence 
  there was any reasonable explanation for the injuries other than the assault.</p>
  <p>[11] The trial judge's findings on the issue of causation were reasonable, were 
  not tainted by any material misapprehension of the evidence and do not suggest 
  a reversal of the onus of proof.</p>
  <p>[12] The Crown's failure to call Jonathon Wamback as a witness gives rise to 
  the next ground of appeal. In closing argument, counsel for the appellants contended 
  that the trial judge should draw an adverse inference from the failure to call 
  Jonathon. In their submission he was a crucial witness and the Crown's failure 
  to call him was unexplained. Counsel pointed to excerpts from Jonathon's medical 
  records which had been filed during the trial and argued that these excerpts 
  supported the claim that Jonathon was able to testify. In response to these 
  submissions the Crown referred to other parts of the same records and submitted 
  that these records showed that Jonathon was not able to testify. None of the 
  medical records was directed specifically to Jonathon's ability to testify at 
  trial.</p>
  <p>[13] In the course of their closing argument, counsel also referred to R. v. 
  Cook (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 498 (S.C.C.), the leading case on the effect 
  of the Crown's failure to call a material witness. That authority indicates 
  that where the Crown fails to call the victim and no explanation is offered 
  for that failure, the trier of fact may draw an adverse inference from the failure 
  to call the victim.</p>
  <p>[14] The trial judge made no reference to the failure to call Jonathon in the 
  course of his careful reasons for judgment. We take from that silence either 
  that the trial judge was satisfied with the Crown's explanation for the failure 
  to call Jonathon or that, as the trier of fact, he chose not to draw an adverse 
  inference from that failure. Either course of conduct was open to the trial 
  judge and neither would result in reversible error.</p>
  <p>[15] Counsel next submitted that the trial judge failed to consider whether 
  the appellants had the necessary fault element to support a conviction for the 
  offence of aggravated assault. The Crown was required to prove objective foreseeability 
  of the risk of bodily harm flowing from the assault: R. v. Foti (2002), 169 
  C.C.C. (3d) 57 at 63 (Man. C.A.); R. v. Vang (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. 
  C.A.). The Crown was not required to prove objective foreseeability of the risk 
  of the injury that Jonathon actually suffered.</p>
  <p>[16] We reject this submission. The existence of the requisite fault element 
  was not a live issue by the end of the trial. It is beyond question that the 
  risk of bodily harm is an objectively foreseeable consequence of the administration 
  of several blows and a kick to the head of another person. Counsel at trial 
  did not argue that the Crown had failed to prove the requisite fault element. 
  The absence of any submissions on this issue reflects the fact that it could 
  not realistically be suggested that objective foresight of the risk of bodily 
  harm had not been proved once the assaults were established.</p>
  <p>[17] Counsel also submitted that the trial judge erred in finding that R.B. 
  and L.P. acted jointly in committing the assault, making it unnecessary for 
  the purposes of liability to determine whether the punch or the kick caused 
  the injury. Counsel rely on the acquittal of K.H. and the gap in time between 
  the punches and the kick in support of this submission. 
</p>
<p><p>[18] It was open to the trial judge to find that the appellants acted together 
  as joint perpetrators of the assault. They went after Jonathon together and 
  confronted him together. In the course of the same series of events which occurred 
  in a short time span both appellants assaulted Jonathon. We cannot agree that 
  the brief interval between the punches and the kick rendered the conclusion 
  that the appellants acted together unreasonable. To the contrary, we think the 
  attempt to portray the two assaults as discrete and unconnected events is a 
  strained and unrealistic interpretation of the events.
</p>
<p>
<p>[19] The trial judge's acquittal of K.H. was based on the uncontested evidence 
  that K.H. was not actually involved in the assault. He could not be liable as 
  a perpetrator. The trial judge did not go on to consider whether K.H. could 
  be liable on some other basis. His failure to do so does not affect the reasonableness 
  or validity of his conclusion that the two appellants jointly assaulted Jonathon 
  and were therefore equally liable for the offence.</p>
<p>
<p>[20] Lastly, counsel for the appellants argued that the trial judge failed 
  to consider relevant evidence in arriving at his conclusion that Jonathon's 
  friends had fabricated an innocent explanation for Jonathon's injuries and offered 
  an explanation to Jonathon's parents on the night of the assault. The friends 
  told Jonathon's parents that Jonathon had fallen on a rock. Counsel for the 
  appellants contend that the trial judge should not have rejected that explanation 
  as untrue. In their submissions, counsel referred to certain differences between 
  the evidence of the two friends of Jonathon who testified. They submit that 
  the trial judge did not address these differences in his reasons.</p>
<p>
<p>[21] The trial judge's failure to allude specifically to the differences in 
  the evidence given by the two witnesses in no way undermines the validity of 
  his conclusion that the explanation offered to Jonathon's parents was false. 
  The differences in the evidence of the two witnesses were not significant. The 
  trial judge reviewed the evidence at some length and alluded to the factors 
  which could impact negatively on the evidence of the two friends. He concluded 
  that the evidence that the friends concocted an innocent explanation for Jonathon's 
  injuries was &quot;understandable and logical, considering the history of the 
  racist graffiti which immediately preceded the attack&quot;. This conclusion 
  is firmly rooted in the evidence and reveals no reversible error.</p>
<p>
<p>[22] The appeals from conviction are dismissed.</p>
<p>The Disposition Appeal by R.B.</p>
<p>
<p>[23] The determination of an appropriate disposition for a young offender who 
  has committed a serious offence is always a difficult task. It is particularly 
  difficult where, as in this case, R.B. is a young person with no criminal record 
  and who, apart from the offence, presents as a person of good character with 
  strong family support and positive prospects. </p>
<p><p>[24] The serious consequences of this offence for Jonathon cannot be overstated. 
  The trial judge properly gave these consequences significant weight in determining 
  the appropriate disposition. We are satisfied, however, that the trial judge 
  erred in finding that the injuries actually suffered by Jonathon were reasonably 
  foreseeable at the time of the assault. The evidence of the experts suggests 
  that the tragic consequences were far from foreseeable. 
</p>
<p>
<p>[25] We are also satisfied that the trial judge erred in principle in failing 
  to give sufficient weight to the circumstances surrounding the assault. On his 
  findings, the confrontation between the appellants and Jonathon was precipitated 
  by the appellants' reasonable and genuine belief that Jonathon was responsible 
  for the disgusting racial graffiti which was appearing in the neighbourhood. 
  Also on his findings, the appellants did not seek out Jonathon intending to 
  assault him. The violence which occurred at the time of the confrontation was 
  spontaneous and very brief. The facts of this case, while no doubt serious, 
  are clearly less serious than those outlined in R. v. R. R. O., [1997] O.J. 
  No. 341, where this court upheld the disposition of one year secure custody 
  for aggravated assault.
<p>[26] Having found that the trial judge erred in principle, it falls to this 
  court to determine the appropriate disposition. Despite R.B.'s positive antecedence 
  and his favourable prospects, we are satisfied that a significant period of 
  secure custody is required to adequately reflect the seriousness of this offence. 
  In deciding the appropriate length of the sentence, we have considered the evidence 
  before the trial judge and the evidence tendered on appeal. The evidence tendered 
  on appeal indicates that the appellant has been under a form of house arrest 
  since July 1999 when he was arrested on these charges. He has been on bail pending 
  appeal on very strict terms including house arrest since March 2001. This appeal 
  should have been heard long ago. Crown counsel candidly acknowledged that the 
  delay in perfecting the appeal could in no way be attributed to R.B. or his 
  counsel. The fresh evidence also indicates that the offence and its aftermath 
  have had extraordinary adverse ramifications for R.B. and the rest of his family. 
  R.B. is now twenty years old. It is fair to say that he is far removed from 
  the young man who committed this heinous offence.
</p>
<p>[27] Giving this difficult problem our best consideration, we are satisfied 
  that a sentence of 6 months secure custody followed by probation for 1 year 
  on the terms set by the trial judge is an appropriate disposition. Any time 
  spent in custody up to now will count towards that 6 month sentence.</p>
<p><p>[28] The appeal from disposition is allowed and the sentence is varied as indicated 
  above.
