<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John D. Ground of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 5, 2002, reported at (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 214.</p>
<p>
  BORINS J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal by the former auditors and actuaries of the Law Society 
  of Upper Canada (&quot;LSUC&quot;) from the dismissal of their motions for an 
  order striking out the statement of claim, or granting summary judgment dismissing 
  the claim, in an action against them by the LSUC and the Lawyers' Professional 
  Indemnity Company (&quot;LPIC&quot;). The LSUC has cross-appealed from that 
  part of the motion judge's order striking out certain paragraphs of the statement 
  of claim.</p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [2] The LSUC is the governing body of the legal profession in Ontario. Since 
  1971, it has required that practicing members of the profession carry minimum 
  levels of professional liability insurance. Until 1990, this mandatory insurance 
  coverage was provided by a group policy issued by third party insurance companies. 
  In 1990, the LSUC incorporated LPIC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, for the purpose 
  of providing professional liability insurance to its members. In these proceedings, 
  the provision of this insurance has been referred to as the Insurance Plan.</p>
<p>
  [3] Although the manner in which the LSUC operated and funded the Insurance 
  Plan is complex, it is sufficient for the purpose of this appeal to state that 
  the LSUC and LPIC have two legal mechanisms to raise revenues to acquire funds 
  to pay the costs and expenses of the Insurance Plan as well as to defend and 
  to pay claims made against members of the LSUC, who under the Insurance Plan 
  are known as Insured Members.</p>
<p>
  [4] The first mechanism is the requirement that an Insured Member pay a deductible, 
  being a small portion of each claims liability. The second is the LSUC's statutory 
  right to levy its members annually to create a fund out of which the LSUC pays 
  liabilities, costs and its reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the 
  Insurance Plan, including a premium to LPIC from which it funds its liabilities. 
  In regard to the second mechanism, Rule 50 of the Law Society's Rules made under 
  The Law Society Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.8, s. 62(1) at the relevant period provided 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The fees and levies that are payable to the Society shall be paid in the circumstances 
  and at the times specified as follows, and the amount of a fee or levy shall 
  be the sum of the amount specified and any tax that is required by law to be 
  paid by the person receiving the service and collected by the Society: </p>
<p class="center"> [ . . . . ]</p>
<p class="indent">
  Indemnity for professional liability</p>
<p class="indent"> A levy for indemnity for professional liability to be used 
  for an insurance fund to cover insurance premiums, reserves, group deductibles, 
  adjusting costs, counsel and legal fees, administration costs and other expenses 
  reasonably incurred in connection with indemnity for professional liability 
  payable to every member who engages in active practice in any year to be paid 
  to the Society at such time and in such amount in any years as Convocation may 
  from time to time determine. . . . </p>
<p class="indent">If at the end of the year the insurance fund is not entirely 
  used up, the surplus remaining shall be carried forward into the next year.</p>
<p>
  [5] For the years 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994, the LSUC and LPIC retained 
  Ernest &amp; Young, in which Clarkson Gordon and Zittrer, Siblin, Stein, Levine 
  were partners (collectively referred to as &quot;E&amp;Y&quot;) as their auditors 
  and Tillinghast, a Towers Perrin Company and Towers Perrin Inc. (collectively 
  referred to as &quot;Tillinghast&quot;) as their actuaries.</p>
<p>
  [6] Auditing services were required by the LSUC for the purpose of obtaining 
  annual audited financial statements to allow it to accurately assess its financial 
  position, including that of its Insurance Plan. In regard to the Insurance Plan, 
  the LSUC required clear and accurate information about the financial position 
  of the Plan and LPIC, including the amount of claims liabilities and their relationship 
  to assets available to meet such liabilities. The LSUC required this information 
  to enable it to make proper decisions concerning, inter alia: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) The level, types and amounts of coverage to offer, and 
  the quantum and nature of liabilities to be underwritten;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) The amount of deductibles to be borne by Insured Members 
  and the terms on which they should bear them; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) The amount of assets it was required to raise annually through 
  the charging of premiums and levies, and the setting of, and levels, of premiums 
  and levies.</p>
<p>
  LPIC required audited financial statements for essentially the same purposes 
  as the LSUC.</p>
<p>
  [7] The LSUC and LPIC retained Tillinghast to provide actuarial valuations of 
  the claims liabilities related to the Insurance Plan. From 1990, Tillinghast 
  prepared actuarial reports and actuarial opinions for LPIC. In general, Tillinghast's 
  valuations, reports and opinions were required to inform and alert the LSUC 
  and LPIC of any circumstances that called into question or threatened the viability 
  or continued operation of the LSUC, LPIC or the Insurance Plan.</p>
<p>
  [8] In their lengthy statement of claim, the LSUC and LPIC (&quot;the plaintiffs&quot;) 
  allege that in April, 1994, they learned the deficits and unpaid claim liabilities 
  relative to the Insurance Plan, as calculated and reported by E&amp;Y and Tillinghast 
  (&quot;the defendants&quot;) were grossly understated, with the result that 
  the Insurance Plan was incurring large unpaid claims liabilities, in amounts 
  considerably in excess of what had been reported. They further allege that the 
  liabilities and deficits were spiralling without control, threatened the financial 
  viability of the LSUC and LPIC, and justified the cessation or serious modification 
  of the Insurance Plan. It is alleged that had correct amounts of unpaid claims 
  liabilities and deficits been reported, E&amp;Y and Tillinghast should have 
  reported a deficit of $67 million in 1991, rising to a deficit of $153 million 
  by 1994.</p>
<p>
  [9] As a result, the LSUC and LPIC allege that it was necessary to take a number 
  of steps to keep the Insurance Plan viable. They increased deductibles. To reduce 
  the rate at which liabilities were incurred, they eliminated some coverages 
  and reduced other coverages. In addition, they substantially increased the annual 
  levies imposed on the members of the LSUC. As such, the LSUC and LPIC allege 
  that they sustained losses in the amount of about $100 million which they would 
  not have incurred had claims liabilities been accurately reported by E&amp;Y 
  and Tillinghast. In this action, they seek to recover damages in the amount 
  of $110 million from their former auditors and actuaries based on breach of 
  contract, negligence and negligent misrepresentation related to claims liabilities 
  and deficits incurred by the Insurance Plan during the years 1991 and 1994.</p>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  [10] The defendants brought similar, but not entirely identical, motions for 
  the purpose of terminating the plaintiffs' action on the pleadings. Both defendants 
  moved for summary judgment dismissing the plaintiffs' claim for damages, or 
  in the alternative, for partial summary judgment dismissing the claim for damages 
  in paragraph 45 of the statement of claim (E&amp;Y) or the claim for damages 
  in paragraphs 42 to 46 of the statement of claim (Tillinghast). In the further 
  alternative, both E&amp;Y and Tillinghast sought a declaration under rule 21.01(1)(a) 
  of the Rules of Civil Procedure determining a question of law, stated as follows 
  in Tillinghast's notice of motion: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [R]egardless of whether there was negligence on the part of defendants and whether 
  or not the plaintiffs relied on representations or reports of the defendants 
  to their detriment, did the plaintiffs sustain damages that are recoverable 
  in law?</p>
<p>
  [11] The motions, as framed, sought to put an end to the plaintiffs' action 
  by either obtaining a summary judgment dismissing the action, or a judgment 
  striking out the statement of claim on the ground that even if the defendants 
  were at fault, as a matter of law the plaintiffs sustained no damages, or if 
  they did, damages were not recoverable from the defendants because the plaintiffs 
  had passed on the damages to the members of the LSUC through supplemental and 
  increased levies.</p>
<p>
  [12] Save for one minor exception, the operative paragraphs of the formal orders 
  of the court reflecting the results of the motions are identical. These paragraphs, 
  in the order in the E&amp;Y motion, read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. THIS COURT ORDERS THAT the motion pursuant to Rule 21 be 
  and is hereby dismissed.</p>
<p class="indent">2. THIS COURT ORDERS AND DECLARES that to the extent the plaintiffs' 
  claim for damages is comprised of a claim for lost interest earned on premiums 
  the plaintiffs say they would have collected in 1991, 1992, 1993 and/or 1994 
  had they known of the size of the deficit, no such claim can be maintained.</p>
<p class="indent">3. THIS COURT ORDERS AND DECLARES that except as set out in 
  paragraph 2 above, the damages claimed by the plaintiffs in the statement of 
  claim, if proven and otherwise established to be recoverable by the plaintiffs 
  from the defendants, are not reduced or eliminated by reason of the collection 
  of any levies by the Law Society of Upper Canada from its members or by reason 
  of any right of the Law Society of Upper Canada to collect any levies from its 
  members, and the motion for summary judgment is hereby dismissed [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  The only difference in the Tillinghast order is that in paragraph 1, &quot;and 
  51.06&quot; follows &quot;Rule 21&quot;. Thus, the motion judge held that the 
  plaintiffs' alleged damages were recoverable, except for the interest component 
  of their damage claim.</p>
<p>
  [13] E&amp;Y and Tillinghast appeal from paragraphs 1 and 3 of the order. The 
  LSUC and LPIC cross-appeal from paragraph 2.</p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  [14] Because of the view that I hold of the result of this appeal, it is unnecessary 
  to provide a detailed review of the reasons of the motion judge. I will confine 
  my review to those portions of his reasons which will be of assistance in developing 
  my reasons for setting aside the orders of the motion judge and ordering that 
  this action proceed to trial.</p>
<p>
  [15] My starting point is an analysis of the defendants' motions. Relying on 
  rule 21.01(1)(a) (determination of a question of law), although properly the 
  subject of a rule 21.01(1)(b) motion (failure to disclose a reasonable cause 
  of action), each defendant sought to strike out the statement of claim on the 
  ground that it is substantively inadequate. In support of their position, the 
  approach taken by the defendants was that the plaintiffs did not sustain any 
  recoverable damages because the deficits and unpaid claims liabilities incurred 
  between 1990 and 1994 were largely eliminated by 1999 by the LSUC's imposition 
  of supplemental and increased levies on its members under the statutory scheme 
  for funding the Insurance Plan. From E&amp;Y's perspective, this resulted in 
  the plaintiffs' failure to sustain any damages. From Tillinghast's perspective, 
  if the plaintiffs sustained damages they were not recoverable as they had been 
  &quot;passed on&quot; to the members of the Law Society through the supplemental 
  and increased levies imposed by LSUC under Law Society Rule 50. In addition, 
  both defendants contended that they were entitled to summary judgment under 
  Rule 20 dismissing the plaintiffs' claims which they said did not raise a genuine 
  issue for trial. The legal issues that underlay the rule 21.01(1)(a) and Rule 
  20 motions are closely related and, in my view, raise complex issues.</p>
<p>
  [16] At the outset of his reasons, the motion judge referred to two factors 
  which are central to the determination of the appeal. At p. 216, the motion 
  judge stated that &quot;it is conceded that there are material facts in dispute 
  and genuine issues for trial with respect to the breach of contract, negligence 
  and negligent misrepresentation alleged in the Statement of Claim&quot;. In 
  this regard, it is significant that in their statements of defence the defendants 
  denied that they had been negligent and further denied that they had breached 
  their contracts with the plaintiffs. He continued at pp. 216-17: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The two main motions before this court are for summary judgment, partial summary 
  judgment or the declaratory relief based on the defendants' position that, even 
  if breach of contract, negligence or negligent misrepresentation could be proved, 
  the plaintiffs have suffered no damages and cannot maintain their actions as 
  all of the unpaid claims liabilities and deficits incurred by the insurance 
  plan in subject years have been recouped by the plaintiffs as a result of supplemental 
  or increased levies imposed on the members of LSUC covered by such insurance 
  plan [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [17] The motion judge then considered the grounds advanced by the defendants 
  in support of their motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims for failing to 
  raise a genuine issue for trial, or, in the alternative, because the claims 
  did not support a legally recognized remedy. Under the headings &quot;Summary 
  Judgment Motions&quot; and &quot;Passing on Defence&quot;, at considerable length 
  he analyzed the nature of the Insurance Plan and reviewed authorities in Canada, 
  England and the United States that appear to have considered whether the passing 
  on defence is one that has received judicial recognition. As I understand his 
  reasons, he considered the central issue raised by the summary judgment motions 
  to be whether recognition should be given to a passing on defence, also referred 
  to as a passing-off defence. At p. 236, he concluded that the defence had received 
  limited recognition in Canada in circumstances &quot;where a taxpayer brings 
  action to recover taxes paid under ultra vires litigation&quot;. As reflected 
  by paragraph 3 of the formal judgments, he effectively declared that the passing 
  on defence was not available to the defendants. Accordingly, he dismissed the 
  defendants' motions both under rule 21.01(1)(a) and Rule 20.</p>
<p>
  [18] However, the motion judge dismissed one element of the plaintiffs' damage 
  claim - the &quot;interest claim&quot;. This is a claim for interest which the 
  plaintiffs allege they would have earned by way of revenue on levies that they 
  would have imposed on the members of the Law Society had they been informed 
  of the true financial position of the Insurance Plan in 1991. In other words, 
  had the LSUC known of the $67 million deficit, it claims that it would have 
  raised additional revenue that might have yielded approximately $29 million 
  in interest. At pp. 224-225, the motion judge provided brief reasons for awarding 
  partial summary judgment dismissing this claim. As I have indicated, the plaintiffs 
  cross-appeal the dismissal of this element of their claim.</p>
<p>
  IV</p>
<p>
  [19] This brings me to my reasons for why I believe that this case should proceed 
  to trial. At the outset of the appeal, the court raised two concerns: (1) whether 
  it had jurisdiction to hear the appeals; and (2) whether it was proper for the 
  motion judge to have adjudicated the defendants' motions &quot;on the facts 
  accepted for the purpose of [the motions]&quot;, as the plaintiffs put it in 
  paragraph 3 of their factum in response to E&amp;Y's appeal, and similarly in 
  paragraph 47(g) of their factum in response to Tillinghast's appeal. Counsel 
  were referred to a number of authorities by the court which then adjourned to 
  permit counsel an opportunity to prepare submissions in response to its concerns.</p>
<p>
  [20] After taking time to consider the submissions of counsel, the court indicated 
  that it was satisfied that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeals. However, 
  it expressed no opinion on whether it was proper for the motion judge to adjudicate 
  the motions on the basis of facts assumed, or conceded, for the purpose of the 
  motions. As I will explain, it is my view that the motion judge should not have 
  acceded to the parties' request that the motions be decided on the basis of 
  facts assumed for the purpose of the motions because in doing so he decided 
  a hypothetical question.</p>
<p>
  [21] The defendants moved under rule 20.04(4) and, alternatively, under rule 
  21.01(1)(a), to obtain an order either dismissing the plaintiffs' action or 
  striking out their statement of claim on one, or both, of two legal grounds. 
  It was their position that the plaintiffs did not sustain legally recoverable 
  damages; however, if they did, the plaintiffs were precluded from recovering 
  the damages because the LSUC passed on the damages to its members through supplemental 
  and increased annual levies. Doctrinally, unless there were no facts in dispute, 
  the defendants could not rely on rule 20.04(4), which permits the court to determine 
  a question of law where it is the only genuine issue for trial: Dawson v. Rexcraft 
  Storage and Warehouse Inc. (1998), 164 D.L.R. (4th) 257 (Ont.C.A.). However, 
  as the motion judge noted at p. 216, the parties had conceded there were material 
  facts in dispute and a genuine issue for trial concerning the defendants' liability. 
  Consequently, to permit the questions of law to be decided the defendants conceded 
  that the plaintiffs could prove their alleged breach of contract, negligence 
  and negligent misrepresentation. However, they did so only for the purpose of 
  their motions. Similarly, it would not have been appropriate for the motion 
  judge to decide as a question of law under rule 21.01(1)(a) that the passing 
  on defence precluded the plaintiffs from recovering the damages that they claimed 
  if there was a factual issue whether the plaintiffs had sustained damages based 
  on the defendants' alleged wrongful conduct: cf. Lennon v. Harris (1999), 45 
  O.R. (3d) 84 (S.C.J.).</p>
<p>
  [22] It follows that because there were facts in dispute concerning the defendants' 
  alleged wrongful conduct, which facts the defendants were prepared to assume 
  in the plaintiffs' favour but only for the purpose of their motions, the motion 
  judge was put in the position of being asked to decide two hypothetical questions. 
  Of course, had the defendants been prepared to admit for all purposes that they 
  had breached their contracts with the plaintiffs or had performed their services 
  negligently, that would have removed the hypothetical nature of the questions 
  of law raised by their motions.</p>
<p>
  [23] Moreover, it appears from the reasons of the motion judge, as well as from 
  the factums of the parties and the oral submissions of counsel, that many underlying 
  facts are in dispute. This reinforces the importance of deciding significant 
  substantive issues on a full factual background that forms the complete picture. 
  Such factual background can best be developed at trial, rather than on an interlocutory 
  motion. I refer, for example, to the dispute among the parties as to the nature 
  of the Insurance Plan, the role of the LSUC and LPIC in respect to the Insurance 
  Plan and, in particular, their responsibility for liabilities and expenses they 
  incurred in connection with the Insurance Plan. Indeed, during oral argument, 
  because there was a such a substantial difference of opinion among counsel as 
  to the underlying or foundation facts, it appeared that counsel for the appellants 
  and the respondents were arguing different cases.</p>
<p>
  V</p>
<p>
  [24] There are a number of recent cases on which I rely in arriving at the conclusion 
  that the motions should not have proceeded on the basis of assumed facts.</p>
<p>
  [25] In Chitel v. Bank of Montreal (1999), 126 O.A.C. 159 (C.A.), the plaintiff 
  had moved for summary judgment. When faced with a record before the motion judge 
  that demonstrated that there were many factual issues in dispute, the plaintiff's 
  counsel abandoned certain factual positions of the plaintiff &quot;for the purpose 
  of the motion&quot; in order &quot;to clean up the record&quot; so that it was 
  appropriate to be heard under Rule 20. This strategy proved to be disastrous 
  for the plaintiff. In the plaintiff's sworn evidence on the motion she said 
  that she had received the consent of one of the parties to mortgage her interest 
  in a property. However, for the purpose of the motion, her counsel conceded 
  that no consent had been obtained. This concession formed the basis of the conclusion 
  of the motion judge that the plaintiff had no case with respect to the majority 
  of her claims, which the motion judge effectively dismissed, when, in narrowing 
  the issues for trial, he deleted the claims.</p>
<p>
  [26] This court was of the view that the plaintiff's concession of facts for 
  the purpose of the motion rendered the motion &quot;procedurally flawed&quot;. 
  At para. 7 the court said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Not only was the plaintiff's procedure strategically misguided, it is unavailable 
  under Rule 20 except in very limited circumstances. (For example, this procedure 
  was used in the case of Guarantee Company of North America v. Gordon Capital 
  Corp., [1999] S.C.J. No. 60 without adverse comment by the court.) In any case 
  where it is left open to the motions judge on a summary judgment motion to narrow 
  the issues for trial or to grant partial summary judgment to any party, then 
  any agreement on the facts must be for the purposes of the entire proceeding.</p>
<p>
  [27] The court went on to say that the problem of deciding a motion on the basis 
  of facts admitted for the purpose of the motion could place the trial judge 
  in a difficult position if he or she were to make a different finding of fact 
  based on the evidence. The court added at para. 10 in a passage that has particular 
  relevance to this appeal: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Besides this problem, it is unclear from the record and the reasons, what facts 
  were found not to be in dispute in order to form the basis for the legal conclusions 
  reached by the motions judge. Rather, it appears that many important facts, 
  as well as inferences from the facts, are very much in dispute in this case 
  and that they are part of a complete story which must be told in its entirety 
  at the trial. Furthermore, because the entire legal analysis was based on, and 
  flowed from, at least one of the facts conceded for the motion only, it is not 
  possible to say that any of the legal results would survive a revision of the 
  facts.</p>
<p>
  [28] In allowing the appeal and ordering that the action proceed to trial on 
  all issues, at para. 11 the court concluded: &quot;Both the facts and the legal 
  issues are complex and require a trial where they can be considered as a whole 
  by one judge who will apply the law to the facts as ultimately found.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [29] The problem created by conceding or admitting facts for the purpose of 
  a motion under Rule 18A of the British Columbia Supreme Court Civil Rules has 
  been considered in three recent judgments of the British Columbia Court of Appeal. 
  Rule 18A is similar in purpose to Ontario Rule 20. The rule permits a party 
  to apply by way of a summary trial for judgment either on an issue or generally, 
  on the basis of an affidavit, answers to interrogatories, discovery evidence, 
  an admission or the written statement of an expert.</p>
<p>
  [30] In Bell Pole Co. v. Commonwealth Insurance Co. (1999), 123 B.C.A.C. 316, 
  the plaintiff appealed a summary trial decision in which certain facts had been 
  assumed for the purpose of the application. Before the appeal was argued, the 
  Court of Appeal raised with counsel whether a summary trial could be decided 
  on assumed facts. Although the court agreed to hear the appeal, it made it clear 
  that it might ultimately decide that the application could not properly be decided 
  on assumed facts.</p>
<p>
  [31] In the argument of the appeal a number of problems arose, principally that 
  the parties were not in agreement on the assumed facts, with the result that 
  they were not in agreement on the law which could properly be advanced. To Esson 
  J.A., these problems established that the attempt to isolate an issue and decide 
  it on assumed facts was misconceived. He observed that although in Steyns v. 
  Manitoba Public Insurance Corp. (1995), 126 D.L.R. (4th) 394 (B.C.C.A.), Finch 
  J.A. was of the view that sometimes it will be appropriate on a Rule 18A motion 
  to decide a question of law on assumed facts, he did not believe it was appropriate 
  to make a definitive statement on the matter. In allowing the appeal and remitting 
  the action for trial on all issues, at para. 15 Esson J.A. stated: &quot;I will 
  say that to proceed with a summary trial on assumed facts is likely to result 
  in the kind of confusion which arose here, and that such a procedure seems inconsistent 
  with the principle that a summary trial is a trial.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [32] The next case is Jam's International Ventures Ltd. v. Westbank Holdings 
  Ltd. (2001), 153 B.C.A.C. 1, which was an appeal from a summary trial under 
  Rule 18A dismissing the plaintiff's claims. The application was heard on the 
  basis of facts assumed for the purpose of the application.</p>
<p>
  [33] In my view, the extensive observations of Lambert J.A. in discussing two 
  of the principles which have guided the British Columbia Court of Appeal in 
  appeals from decisions under Rule 18A warrant repetition.</p>
<p>
  [34] At paras. 4-5, Lambert J.A. observed: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The first principle applies to those cases where the summary trial relates to 
  only one issue in the appeal and is not a trial of the whole proceeding. The 
  principle was stated in District of North Vancouver v. Fawcett (1998) 162 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 402 where, in a unanimous judgment, the Court said this, at p.413: </p>
<p class="indent15"> With respect, it seems to me that if the answer to an issue 
  sought to be tried under rule 18A will only resolve the whole proceeding if 
  one answer is given, but not if a different answer is given, then the applicant 
  should be required to demonstrate, and the judge should be expected to decide, 
  that the administration of justice, as it affects not just the parties to the 
  motion, but also the orderly use of court time, will be enhanced by dealing 
  with the issue as a separate issue. It cannot be enough simply that the parties 
  have agreed to a summary trial of one or more issues, but not all of the issues, 
  raised in the proceeding, without any consideration for the effective use of 
  court time, or the efficient resolution of the proceeding.</p>
<p class="indent">The second principle applies to those cases where the Court 
  is asked to make assumptions of fact or mixed fact and law in a course of an 
  18A proceeding. Those assumptions can produce a hypothetical issue and often 
  result in a situation where careful attention should be given to the first principle 
  I mentioned because the resulting issue may not be a real issue in the case 
  and it may save no time or expense to have it decided. There are a number of 
  cases which discuss the difficulties of dealing with an 18A application on the 
  basis of assumptions. I will mention only two: Steyns v. Manitoba Public Insurance 
  Corp. (1995) 7 B.C.L.R. (3d) 106 and Bell Pole Co. v. Commonwealth Insurance 
  Co. (1997) 66 B.C.L.R. (3d) 79 [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [35] Lambert J.A. then quoted the passage from Esson J.A.'s reasons for judgment 
  in Bell Pole cited in part above, and continued paras. 7-8: </p>
<p class="indent"> I would like to add this; the problem is particularly acute 
  in those cases where the court has been asked to decide the 18A application 
  on assumed facts which are not conceded by the applicant to be true. In most 
  cases if the application is dismissed the applicant on assumed facts seeks to 
  retain the right to prove the true facts which may or may not be the same as 
  the assumed facts. As in the Bell Pole case I would not make a definitive ruling 
  on this issue until the issue itself is argued and not simply raised by this 
  Court.</p>
<p class="indent">I think it would be a rare case where the Court was asked to 
  assume facts which were not also conceded to be true for all purposes of the 
  litigation by all parties to the litigation and where it would be wise for the 
  court to give a judgment on those assumed facts. Of course, when all parties 
  are prepared to concede that the facts put forward on the application are true 
  and should be treated as such by all parties to the litigation, for all purposes 
  of the litigation and not simply for the 18A proceeding, and all parties agree 
  that that is so, then no problem is likely to arise. But those facts are not 
  assumed facts they are admitted facts [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [36] In allowing the appeal and sending the case to trial, Lambert J.A. was 
  of the view that the issue of law presented by the application could not be 
  resolved on the basis of the assumed facts. He stated that both the legal and 
  factual questions required &quot;a fuller evidentiary basis than was achieved 
  on the rule 18A proceeding&quot;. He concluded at para 29: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I add that the fact that only a part of a proceeding was before the court, on 
  the 18A application, leaves me in this case with a measure of apprehension that 
  facts found on the full trial may be shown to be different from the facts underlying 
  the chambers judge's dismissal of the action against the developer under rule 
  18A [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [37] The final case is Hobbs v. Robertson (2002), 23 C.P.C. (5th) 17 (B.C.C.A.). 
  In this case the family of a woman who died of blood loss during surgery sued 
  the defendant doctors for negligence. The doctors relied on a document signed 
  by the deceased entitled &quot;Refusal to Permit Blood Transfusions&quot;, which 
  they claimed released them from any liability. They applied under Rule 18A for 
  a summary determination of whether, assuming that the blood loss resulted from 
  their negligence, the document provided a complete answer to the claims against 
  them. The doctors appealed from the dismissal of their application.</p>
<p>
  [38] After discussing Bell Pole, Newbury J.A. referred to the earlier case of 
  Buckley v. British Columbia Teachers' Federation (1992), 65 B.C.L.R. 155 (C.A.), 
  where the British Columbia Court of Appeal was critical of a Rule 18A application 
  brought on assumed facts. At para. 9, she quoted extensively from the reasons 
  in that case of Lambert J.A., who underscored the potential problems that could 
  arise where an application is made on assumed facts, and where the application 
  is dismissed, or does not deal with all the issues, resulting in a trial at 
  which the facts as found by the trial judge differ from the assumed facts. In 
  my view, the following passage from Lambert J.A.'s reasons in Buckley (as quoted 
  in Bell Pole) is helpful: </p>
<p class="indent"> To decide otherwise would be to permit the Supreme Court Rules, 
  and particularly R. 52(11) and 18A, though the same principle is applicable 
  to Rule 34, to be used to decide hypothetical or moot questions which may turn 
  out, in the end, to have no direct bearing on the outcome of the proceedings.</p>
<p class="indent">Rule 18A permits a party to apply to the court for judgment 
  either upon an issue or generally. In my opinion such a judgment, if given, 
  is a judgment which disposes once and for all of the issues on which it is given.</p>
<p class="indent">By an application to amend the notice of appeal and appellant's 
  factum, counsel for the federation drew our attention to the decision of this 
  court in Hill v. Vernon (City) (March 25, 1991), Doc. Vancouver CA010436, [1991] 
  B.C.W.L.D. 1227, in which it was said that an application under R. 18A might 
  well involve the determination of a contested question of fact, but that it 
  should not go ahead under R. 18A on assumptions about the facts which might 
  later prove to be wrong, unless both parties agreed that those assumptions were 
  final.</p>
<p class="indent">I would adopt a similar approach in this case to the issues 
  raised for decision under R. 18A. A judgment on those issues under R. 18A is 
  final. That finality cannot be undermined by later assertions that the true 
  facts are different from the facts which were before the court when it gave 
  its R. 18A judgment [emphasis added by Newbury J.A.].</p>
<p>
  [39] After reviewing the authorities, Newbury J.A. observed at para. 9: &quot;A 
  summary trial on assumed facts may, then, be a confusing and futile exercise.&quot; 
  She concluded at paras. 11-12: </p>
<p class="indent"> For the foregoing reasons, we advised counsel after hearing 
  brief submissions that the appeal was allowed on the basis that the Chambers 
  judge should not have proceeded with the application before him and that rather, 
  the facts must be found in the usual way before the issues raised by the appeal 
  may be properly decided. Counsel later made written submissions which have been 
  duly considered.</p>
<p class="indent">I add only that I would not want to be taken as discouraging 
  attempts by counsel to use R. 18A to obtain the judicial determination of issues 
  that can be properly decided summarily by a court of law, thereby avoiding the 
  expense and inconvenience of a full-blown trial. Rule 18A has proved to be an 
  invaluable tool to British Columbia courts and to British Columbia litigants 
  in having many legal disputes decided in an efficient and timely way. Such cases, 
  however, are dependent on a proper factual foundation, which did not exist in 
  this case.</p>
<p>
  [40] An earlier case which is also helpful because of its similarity to this 
  case is Barnes v. Kaladar, Angelsea and Effingham (Townships) (1985), 52 O.R. 
  (2d) 283 (H.C.J.). In that case, Callaghan A.C.J.H.C. refused to hear a motion 
  under rule 21.01(1)(a) for the determination of a question of law on the assumption 
  that the facts in the statement of claim could be proved. The plaintiff had 
  sued the defendants for negligently supplying firefighting services. In their 
  statement of defence, the defendants specifically denied any negligence in fighting 
  the fire.</p>
<p>
  [41] Callaghan A.C.J.H.C. gave the following reasons for refusing to hear the 
  motion at p. 285: </p>
<p class="indent"> Therefore, if one considers the circumstances of this case 
  and the plaintiffs' statement of claim in light of the statement of the defence, 
  you are faced with the realization that the fundamental issue for trial is the 
  question of whether or not there was negligence on the part of either or both 
  parties. The defendant has denied negligence on the part of the plaintiffs. 
  I do not see how a ruling at this time on the assumption that the facts in the 
  statement of claim are correct would in any way shorten the trial or result 
  in a substantial saving of costs. The issue of negligence must be tried on its 
  merits.</p>
<p class="indent">I also think it is significant that the question posed raises 
  the issue of whether or not the court in exercising its jurisdiction under this 
  rule should be placed in the position of advising a plaintiff as to the validity 
  of its cause of action when the facts which form the substratum of the alleged 
  cause of action are in dispute. That matter was dealt with properly in Gladstone 
  Petroleums Ltd. V. Husky Oil (Alberta) Ltd. (1968), 1 D.L.R. (3d) 219 at p. 
  229, 66 W.W.R. 641, per Hall J.A.: </p>
<p class="indent15">The point of law which the learned Chamber Judge has here ordered 
  to be tried rests entirely on allegations of fact raised by the plaintiff itself. 
  In my opinion, it is not the purpose of the rule to permit a plaintiff to test 
  his view of the law before presenting his case. If it were, the Courts would 
  continually be trying what would in reality be hypothetical questions of law.</p>
<p>
  At p. 286, Callaghan A.C.J.H.C. added: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In my view the plaintiff herein cannot invoke rule 21.01(a) for a determination 
  as to whether or not it has a cause of action where the facts fundamental to 
  that cause are in dispute. To rule otherwise would lead the court into the realm 
  of the hypothetical.</p>
<p>
  [42] Helpful also is the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Goudie v. 
  Ottawa (City), 2003 SCC 14, that was released subsequent to the argument of 
  this appeal. The defendant had moved under rule 21.01(3)(a) to have the plaintiffs' 
  claim struck out on the basis that the court had no jurisdiction over a &quot;labour 
  relations&quot; subject matter. This court set aside the motion judge's dismissal 
  of the claim on the basis that it would be open to a trial judge to find a pre-employment 
  agreement altogether outside the City's collective agreement with the labour 
  union that represented the plaintiffs. A further appeal to the Supreme Court 
  was dismissed. Writing for a unanimous court, Binnie J. held that while a dispute 
  which &quot;in its essential character&quot; arises from a collective agreement 
  is to be determined by an arbitrator appointed in accordance with the collective 
  agreement, access to the courts is not denied to a plaintiff who alleges a cause 
  of action outside the collective agreement.</p>
<p>
  [43] In reasons that are relevant to this appeal, Binnie J. was critical of 
  the City's attempt to resolve the jurisdictional issue on a preliminary motion 
  because the existence of a pre-employment agreement, which was central to the 
  plaintiffs' claim, was in dispute as disclosed by conflicting affidavits filed 
  on the motion by the parties. To Binnie J., the principal difficulty confronting 
  the City on its motion was not legal but factual. At para. 30, he stated: &quot;That 
  being the case, I do not think that the appellant could avoid the exigencies 
  of a summary judgment motion (rule 20) by framing its attack as a jurisdictional 
  challenge under clause 21.01(3)(a).&quot;</p>
<p>
  [44] Binnie J. concluded as follows at paras. 33-34: </p>
<p class="indent"> The respondents were under no evidentiary obligation at this 
  stage to prove the existence of a pre-employment contract for the purposes of 
  surviving a jurisdictional challenge under clause 21.01(3)(a). The pleadings 
  themselves established that the central allegation of jurisdictional fact (the 
  existence of a pre-employment contract) was also the central issue on liability 
  in the law suit. This is not a jurisdictional issue that turns on uncontroverted 
  or easily ascertainable facts. Clearly, credibility would very much be an issue.</p>
<p class="indent">I agree with the Ontario Court of Appeal that the appellant's 
  approach was misconceived. The disagreement between the parties was essentially 
  factual, not legal. In light of the factual issues raised by the pleadings, 
  the jurisdictional issue could not be determined on a preliminary motion. The 
  motions judge should not therefore have driven the respondents so precipitously 
  &quot;from the judgment seat&quot;, per Wilson J. in Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., 
  [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959, at p. 973.</p>
<p>
  [45] Earlier in his reasons, in responding to a submission not unlike that made 
  by the appellants in this appeal, Binnie J. stated at para. 27: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The appellant complains that it is being put to the trouble and expense of a 
  law suit merely on the bare allegation of a pre-employment contract. This is 
  true, but of course the courts are open to any litigant who &quot;merely&quot; 
  alleges a cause of action. Procedures exist under the rules of practice to obtain 
  particulars or to bring frivolous or unsupportable claims to an early resolution. 
  The losing litigant may, depending on the view taken of the matter by the motions 
  judge, find itself burdened with costs.</p>
<p>
  VI</p>
<p>
  [46] To succeed in this action, the plaintiffs must prove that one or both of 
  the defendants were either in breach of contract or negligent, or both, and 
  that as a result the plaintiffs sustained legally recoverable damages. Should 
  the plaintiffs prove the alleged wrongful conduct, for the defendants to avoid 
  paying damages they must persuade the court that their breach of contract or 
  negligence did not cause the plaintiffs to sustain damages, or if their wrongful 
  conduct caused damages to the plaintiffs, that they are precluded from recovering 
  them because the damages were passed on to the members of the LSUC. Central 
  to any recovery by the plaintiffs is whether they can prove that the defendants 
  were in breach of contract or negligent, which allegations are denied by the 
  defendants in their statements of defence. Although the defendants did not specify 
  the particulars of their breach of contract or their negligence, they asked 
  the motion judge to assume for the purpose of the motion only that they were 
  in breach of contract or negligent. However, the defendants' concession of their 
  liability for the purpose of the motion necessarily contains a concession that 
  they committed the underlying acts which the plaintiffs allege in their statement 
  of claim. As the above cases illustrate, because the motion judge's legal analysis 
  was informed by the defendants' concession of their alleged wrongful conduct, 
  it is not possible to say that any of the legal results that flow from the motion 
  judge's order will survive a revision of the facts at the trial that is to be 
  held consequent to the motion judge's order. As the defendants' motion was dismissed, 
  there must be a trial at which the facts as found by the trial judge may differ 
  from the facts assumed for the purpose of the motions. This possible revision 
  of the facts on the basis of a complete trial record graphically demonstrates 
  the hypothetical nature of the questions of law that the motion judge was asked 
  to decide. It is not the purpose of rule 21.01(1)(a) to enable a party to obtain 
  the advisory opinion of the court as to the validity of its cause of action 
  or defence where the facts that constitute the substratum thereof are in dispute.</p>
<p>
  [47] In my view, therefore, the motion judge should not have proceeded with 
  the defendants' motions on assumed facts. As I have indicated, at the outset 
  of his reasons the motion judge stated that the parties conceded that there 
  were material facts in dispute concerning the defendants' alleged breach of 
  contract and negligence, which were denied by the defendants in the statement 
  of defence. He should not have been placed in the position of advising the defendants 
  of the legal validity of their defence when the facts which formed the foundation 
  of the plaintiffs' claims were in dispute. Rather, the facts in this complex 
  case must be found in the usual way by a trial judge before the issues raised 
  by this appeal may properly be decided. In the result, the motion judge decided 
  a hypothetical question. The hypothetical nature of his decision is highlighted 
  by the italicized words in paragraph 3 of the formal order of the motion judge 
  which is reproduced in para. 12 of these reasons.</p>
<p>
  VII</p>
<p>
  [48] There is, in my opinion, a somewhat different approach that can be taken 
  to this appeal that also demonstrates that this case should proceed to trial. 
  As I have indicated, whether viewed from the perspective of a rule 20.04(4) 
  motion or a rule 21.01(1)(a) motion, the central issue is still the same. On 
  the assumption that the plaintiffs are able to prove that they sustained damages 
  that were caused by the defendants' breach of contract or negligence, that issue 
  is whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovering the damages because 
  they were passed on to the members of the LSUC by way of supplemental and increased 
  levies. The motion judge decided this issue on the ground that the passing on 
  defence has not been judicially recognized in Canada, with one exception that 
  does not apply in this case, with result that the defendants were unable to 
  rely on the passing on defence to preclude the plaintiffs from recovering damages.</p>
<p>
  [49] In reaching this conclusion, the motion judge effectively approached the 
  motion as if it had been brought under rule 21.01(1)(b) in deciding that the 
  passing on of damages to a third party fails to disclose a reasonable defence. 
  In doing so, he implicitly applied the plain and obvious test developed in Hunt 
  v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959, which test, I note, proceeds on the 
  assumption that the facts stated in the statement of claim, or the statement 
  of defence, can be proved. As pointed out in MacDonald v. Ontario Hydro (1994), 
  19 O.R. (3d) 529 (Gen. Div.), aff'd (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 401 (Div. Ct.), the 
  plain and obvious test applies to both rules 21.01(a) and 21.01(b).</p>
<p>
  [50] From the perspective of the plain and obvious test, it is my opinion that 
  this action should proceed to trial. From my reading of the authorities considered 
  by the motion judge, as well as those referred to by counsel, it is not plain 
  and obvious, as a matter of law, that the passing on defence does not constitute 
  a reasonable defence. As this court said in R.D. Belanger and Associates Ltd. 
  v. Stadium Corp. of Ontario Ltd. (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 778 at 782: &quot;Matters 
  of law which have not been settled fully in our jurisprudence should not be 
  disposed of at this [interlocutory] stage of the proceedings.&quot; This principle 
  was applied recently by this court in Spasic Estate v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd. 
  (2000), 188 D.L.R. (4th) 577 in permitting a claim for damages based on the 
  tort of spoliation of documents to proceed to trial. In Spasic the court was 
  of the opinion that it is for a trial judge in the context of a full evidentiary 
  record to determine whether the tort of spoliation is recognized by Canadian 
  jurisprudence. In this appeal, there is no better indicator that the law concerning 
  the recognition of a passing on defence is unsettled than the decision of the 
  Supreme Court of Canada, announced on the second day of the hearing, to grant 
  leave to appeal from a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal on the 
  issue of whether the Court of Appeal erred in accepting the &quot;passing-off&quot; 
  defence and awarding no damages for commercial timber damaged or destroyed in 
  a fire: British Columbia v. Canadian Forest Products Ltd. (2002), 166 B.C.A.C. 
  122, leave to appeal to S.C.C. granted (2003), [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 269. This 
  case was relied on in this appeal by the appellant Tillinghast.</p>
<p>
  [51] Finally, I would add as did Newbury J.A. in Hobbs v. Robertson, supra, 
  that I do not want to be taken as discouraging attempts by counsel to use the 
  Rules of Civil Procedure to obtain the judicial determination of issues that 
  can be properly decided summarily at the pleading stage, thereby avoiding the 
  expense, inconvenience and delay of a trial, as well as effecting judicial economy. 
  Such cases, however, are dependent on a proper factual foundation, which does 
  not exist in this case.</p>
<p>
  VIII</p>
<p>
  [52] As the trial judge should not have heard the defendants' motions on the 
  basis of facts assumed for the purpose of the motions, I would, as this court 
  did in similar circumstances in Chitel v. Bank of Montreal, supra, allow the 
  appeals and the cross-appeal, set aside in their entirety the orders of the 
  motion judge and order that this action proceed to trial. The parties are to 
  address the costs of the motions and the appeal by way of written submissions. 
  E&amp;Y and Tillinghast are to provide the Senior Legal Officer with submissions 
  on costs and their bills of costs within 15 days from the release of these reasons. 
  The LSUC and LPIC may file their submissions and their bill of costs within 
  seven days after receipt of the appellants' submissions. The appellants may 
  respond within seven days thereafter.</p>

<p>
  &quot;S. Borins J.A.&quot;</p>

<p>
  McMurtry C.J.O. (Concurring): </p>
<p>
  [53] I have had the opportunity to review the reasons of my colleagues, and 
  I agree with the disposition of the appeal and cross-appeal as reached by Borins 
  J.A. However, with respect, I cannot agree with his conclusion that the appellants' 
  hypothetical admission of negligence is fatal to their motion under rule 21.01(1)(a). 
  </p>
<p>
  [54] Rule 21.01(1)(a) authorizes a party to move for a preliminary determination 
  of a question of law, &quot;where the determination of the question may dispose 
  of all or part of the action, substantially shorten the trial or result in a 
  substantial saving of costs.&quot; For the reasons that follow, it is my view 
  that it was appropriate under this rule to set aside the issue of negligence 
  in order to seek a preliminary determination on the issue of damages. While 
  I conclude that this matter must proceed to trial for the other reasons enunciated 
  by Borins J.A., I am of the view that this approach had the potential to dispose 
  of the case or at least significantly simplify the trial which, of course, could 
  result in a substantial saving of costs. In my opinion, this approach should 
  not be discouraged in the appropriate case.</p>
<p>
  [55] The appellants moved before the motions judge, and having been unsuccessful, 
  appeal to this court asserting that, even if they were negligent, the plaintiffs 
  have no recoverable damages because they subsequently increased levies to members 
  of the Law Society so as to have the necessary funds to pay their liabilities 
  and expenses. One of the appellant's principal arguments has been correctly 
  characterized by the motions judge as a &quot;passing-on&quot; defence.</p>
<p>
  [56] The motions judge did not determine that the plaintiffs had suffered no 
  loss but determined that, on the facts accepted for the purpose of the motion, 
  the plaintiffs had suffered losses and damages as a result of the defendants' 
  negligence.</p>
<p>
  [57] The issue on the motions was framed by the motions judge as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the case at bar, it is apparent that the plaintiffs had suffered actual losses 
  in the operation of the insurance plan in the subject years and the issue is 
  whether they can recover damages for such losses in view of the fact that the 
  losses were recouped by the imposition of supplemental and increased levies 
  on the members of the LSUC.</p>
<p>
  [58] The motions judge rejected the appellants' passing-on defence stating in 
  part as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I prefer to adopt a principle &#133; that a wrongdoer should not be immune from 
  liability for its wrongful acts simply because the person harmed by those acts 
  has been able to recover the amount of the losses incurred by accessing other 
  sources of revenue or exercising contractual or statutory rights it has. The 
  fact that the plaintiffs in our cases are, pursuant to the [Law Society Act] 
  and the Rule thereunder, able to recoup the losses suffered by the LSUC insurance 
  plan during the subject years by the imposition of supplementary and increased 
  levies on the members of the LSUC should not in my view yield the result that 
  the defendants are shielded from any liability for their negligence or breach 
  of contract, if proven in this action.</p>
<p>
  [59] The appellants sought a determination of two questions under rule 21.01(1)(a) 
  as follows: (a) assuming that the respondent could prove a cause of action, 
  the respondents had not suffered any damages; (b) whether there is a &quot;passing 
  on&quot; defence in Canadian law, and whether this defence applies in the present 
  case. In my view, the answer to these questions does not turn on a determination 
  of the issue of negligence and I agree with the observation of Carthy J.A. that 
  the hypothetical concession in this case was not strictly necessary. </p>
<p>
  [60] I also agree with Carthy J.A. that &quot;the hypothetical to be avoided 
  is one where the underpinning of the legal determination sought under Rule 21 
  may be altered at trial, and the legal determination thus rendered redundant&quot;. 
  This was the kind of problematic hypothetical that, for example, arose in Chitel. 
  In that case, counsel for the plaintiff made a concession for the purposes of 
  the motion, on a point which was essential to the determination of the motion 
  but which could have become an issue at trial. In our case, however, the hypothetical 
  concession was not essential for the determination of the legal issues before 
  the motions judge.</p>
<p>
  [61] In the present case, there are a number of underlying facts in dispute. 
  The basis of the respondents' claim to damages is that, had it known the true 
  extent of its exposure, it would have acted more quickly to reduce insurance 
  coverage. The appellant contends that this assertion is speculative and cannot 
  be proven. As Borins J.A. observes, the parties also do not agree on the nature 
  of the Insurance Plan, the role of LSUC and LPIC in respect to the Insurance 
  Plan, and their responsibility for liabilities and expenses incurred in connection 
  with the Insurance Plan. These issues must be resolved in order to determine 
  whether the respondents suffered damages. </p>
<p>
  [62] Finally, for the reasons expressed by Justice Borins at paras. 48-50, it 
  is my view that it is premature to determine whether there is a passing on defence 
  in the present case.</p>
<p>
  [63] For these reasons, I am also in agreement with the disposition proposed 
  by Justice Borins at para. 52 of his reasons.</p>

<p>
  CARTHY J.A.: (Dissenting)</p>
<p>
  [64] I cannot agree with the reasons of Borins J.A. As I see it, the lawyers 
  involved in this litigation reached a consensus that, if they had an answer 
  from the court as to the overarching issue of whether compensable damages could 
  be proved, the case would either be resolved or much simplified. No counsel 
  sought to have the motion or appeal dealt with as a referral to trial. They 
  were clearly seeking, in the words of rule 21.01(1)(a), to &quot;substantially 
  shorten the trial or result in a substantial saving of costs&quot;. A final 
  determination of the legal issue as to whether recoverable damages were sustained 
  would end the case on one result, or lead to the potential, usually achieved 
  in negligence actions, of settlement before trial.</p>
<p>
  [65] The essence of the motion lies within rule 21.01(1)(a), seeking a determination 
  of a question of law. Here, two questions of law. Were damages sustained and, 
  if so, does the defence of &quot;passing on&quot; prevent their recovery. It 
  is only after those questions of law are resolved that any issue of summary 
  judgment under Rule 20 or striking of pleadings under rule 21.01(1)(b) could 
  arise. Thus, I would not look to jurisprudence concerning the latter rules to 
  determine the outcome of this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [66] In Nelles v. Ontario, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170, the court found jurisdiction 
  under the predecessor to rule 21.01(1)(a) to deal with the discrete question 
  of prosecutorial immunity prior to a trial on the general liability issue.</p>
<p>
  [67] The original motion was brought under former Rule 124 dealing with questions 
  of law and Rule 126 dealing with striking of pleadings. The lower courts had 
  dealt with the issue under Rule 126. McIntyre J., in dissent on this point, 
  held that there should be a trial because the result was not plain and obvious 
  on the face of the pleadings.</p>
<p>
  [68] In speaking for a majority of the court, Lamer J. said at pp. 176-177: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A review of the cases dealing with the application of Rule 124 and Rule 126 
  reveals the following. The difference between the two rules lies in the summary 
  nature of Rule 126 as opposed to the more detailed consideration of issues under 
  Rule 124. A court should strike a pleading under Rule 126 only in plain and 
  obvious cases where the pleading is bad beyond argument. Rule 124 is designed 
  to provide a means of determining, without deciding the issues of fact raised 
  by the pleadings, a question of law that goes to the root of the action. I would 
  like to point out that what is at issue here is not whether malicious prosecution 
  is a reasonable cause of action. A suit for malicious prosecution has been recognized 
  at common law for centuries dating back to the reign of Edward I. What is at 
  issue is whether the Crown, Attorney General and Crown Attorneys are absolutely 
  immune from suit for the well-established tort of malicious prosecution. This 
  particular issue has been given careful consideration both by the Court of Appeal 
  and in argument before this Court. The Court of Appeal for Ontario undertook 
  a thorough review of authorities in the course of a lengthy discussion of arguments 
  on both sides of the issue. As such it matters not in my view whether the matter 
  was disposed of under Rule 124 or 126. To send this matter back for trial without 
  resolving the issue of prosecutorial immunity would not be expeditious and would 
  add both time and cost to an already lengthy case.</p>
<p>
  [69] Here we have the discrete question of whether the Law Society suffered 
  compensable loss when it was not informed of its true claims experience and 
  thus postponed remedial steps to lower the incidence of claims. The remedial 
  steps included reducing coverage, increasing deductibles, and adjusting rates 
  so that the experience in future years would be a lowering of the level of claims 
  to the level of the assessments. The major claim in the action is that if these 
  steps had been taken earlier the total of the claims would have been reduced 
  in the intervening years.</p>
<p>
  [70] In the course of argument of the appeal on its merits, I did not identify 
  any factual difference between the parties underlying this issue. The essential 
  facts for a determination of the legal issue are set out in paragraphs two to 
  nine of the reasons of Borins J.A. without any suggestion that they are in question. 
  These facts concerning the Law Society's financial and corporate position relating 
  to the insurance are immutable and, given an answer to the question posed, would 
  not become hypothetical by reason of any finding on the issues of negligence 
  or contractual breach. Rather, these facts would be irrelevant at a trial on 
  these issues, as would be the question of Crown immunity in Nelles.</p>
<p>
  [71] Nor is the motion impaired by the fact that the concession of negligence 
  was for the limited purpose of the motion. The concession was unnecessary and 
  did not alter the fact that the legal issue was discrete and severable. In Nelles, 
  no one felt it necessary to concede negligence in order to reach the legal issue. 
  In fact, it is difficult to imagine how a part of an action could be eliminated, 
  as contemplated by rule 21.01(1)(a), without leaving another part to be proved 
  in order to complete the action. The concession did not create a hypothetical. 
  In the judgments speaking on this subject, the hypothetical to be avoided is 
  one where an underpinning of the legal determination sought under Rule 21 may 
  be altered at trial, and the legal determination thus rendered redundant. That 
  cannot happen in this instance. The facts surrounding the concession have no 
  bearing upon those relating to the legal issue of damage recoverability.</p>
<p>
  [72] The rules should not be construed as if they create jurisdictional issues. 
  They are intended to further the most expeditious and least expensive determination 
  on the merits. I would echo the thought expressed by Lamer J. that it would 
  be preferable to take advantage of the consideration by the motion judge and 
  the lengthy arguments by counsel before us rather than directing that the entire 
  process be repeated.</p>
<p>
  [73] Since this is a dissenting view, I will express no opinion on the merits 
  of the appeal.</p>
