<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Robert F. Scott of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated January 30, 2001.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The primary issue in this appeal is the definition of legal services under 
  the Law Society Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.8.</p> <P>
  [2] Mr. Stoangi was a former member of the Law Society of Upper Canada, called 
  to the Bar in 1977. Based on various complaints he was suspended in 1978 (initially 
  disbarred), and as a result of an ongoing investigation, in 1984, he was permanently 
  disbarred. It was alleged by the Law Society of Upper Canada that Mr. Stoangi 
  acted as a lawyer on at least two occasions: (1) when he acted for a landlord 
  in the renewal of a commercial lease in 1999; and (2) when he acted for the 
  owners of a property in a boundary line dispute. Based on his reading of all 
  the written material filed by the parties to the application, the application 
  judge granted the injunction and ordered Stoangi to pay $750 costs to LSUC.</p> <P>
  [3] We are conscious that the record in this case could certainly have been 
  developed more fully. Nevertheless, we are of the opinion that it was open to 
  the application judge to conclude that Mr. Stoangi was practising law. </p> <P>
  [4] With respect to the first allegation involving a commercial lease, Mr. Stoangi 
  on behalf of the lessor, wrote to the lawyer for 1190355 Ontario Inc., taking 
  the position that the company had failed to exercise its option to renew the 
  lease and that he would be acting for the lessor with respect to the negotiation 
  of a new lease. Whether or not the lease had been properly renewed was the issue 
  between the parties and involved a question of law. Mr. Stoangi was representing 
  one of the parties to the lease and would, of necessity, have been advising 
  him. He was acting as more than a negotiator and was not acting as a mediator.</p> <P>
  [5] Similarly, with respect to the boundary dispute, Mr. Stoangi indicated in 
  his letter, dated August 30, 1999, that, &quot;It is apparent from the searches 
  and further investigation that the Barberas and their predecessor in title have 
  had the uninterrupted use of the disputed northerly boundary of your property 
  since 1964.&quot; He concluded, &quot;If you are not prepared to enter into 
  this agreement and move the fence, the Barberas will have no other recourse 
  but to commence an action based on a prescriptive right of ownership achieved 
  over a period of uninterrupted use since 1964.&quot; Based on this letter, it 
  was open to the trial judge to infer that Mr. Stoangi had advised the Barberas 
  that they had acquired title by adverse possession, that they had what amounted 
  to uninterrupted use of the property and that he had given the Barberas an assessment 
  of their claim, namely, that they had a right of action.</p> <P>
  [6] Section 50(1) of the Act provides that &quot;except where otherwise provided 
  by law&quot; no person other than a member of the law society shall act or practise 
  as a barrister or solicitor. The section reads:</p> 
<P class="indent"> 50. (1) Except where otherwise provided by law,</p>
<P class="indent">(a) no person, other than a member whose rights and privileges 
  are not suspended, shall act as a barrister or solicitor or hold themself out 
  as or represent themself to be a barrister or solicitor or practise as a barrister 
  or solicitor; </p>
<P>
  [7] The exception - &quot;where otherwise provided by law&quot; - refers to 
  statutes that specifically provide that agents who are not barristers or solicitors 
  may appear and represent another person before designated adjudicative bodies 
  and tribunals: see Regina v. Lawrie and Pointts Ltd. (1987), 59 O. R. (2d) 161 
  (C.A.). The appellant was not acting under any such legislative authority so 
  as to be excepted from section 50(1) of the Act. </p> 
<P> [8] Although the appellant does not come within the exception for agents, 
  the issue before the court is whether what the appellant did constituted acting 
  as a barrister or solicitor or practising as a barrister and solicitor. The 
  Ontario legislature has not defined these terms in any statute regulating the 
  legal profession nor has the Law Society of Upper Canada defined &quot;practice 
  of law&quot; or &quot;acting as a lawyer&quot; either in the Rules of Professional 
  Conduct or in its by-laws. However, a statutory definition of the &quot;practice 
  of law&quot; is found in the regulatory statutes of British Columbia, Manitoba, 
  Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island. These statutes provide that &quot;giving 
  legal advice&quot; for a fee or expectation of a fee constitutes the &quot;practice 
  of law.&quot;<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<P> [9] In Ontario, there is long-standing case law which has interpreted &quot;practising 
  as a solicitor&quot;<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> to include advising 
  another on legal questions: Regina ex. rel. Smith v. Mitchell (1952), 102 C.C.C. 
  307 (Co. Ct.) aff'd (1952),104 C.C.C. 247 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Zaza (May 1974, 
  Co. Ct., unreported) aff'd [1975] O.J. No. 1113 (Div. Ct.); Regina v. Engel 
  and Seaway Divorcing Service (1976), 11 O.R. (2d) 343 (Prov. Ct., Crim. Div.); 
  R. v. Brunet (July 13, 1987, Prov. Ct., unreported).</p>
<P>
  [10] In his report on paralegals: A Framework for Regulating Paralegal Practice 
  in Ontario (Toronto: Queen's Printer, 2000), the Honourable Peter Cory examined 
  which legal services paralegals should be allowed to perform in the interests 
  of members of the public who require such services. His recommendations did 
  not include providing legal advice as a service that paralegals should be allowed 
  to offer or perform.</p> <P>
  [11] The jurisprudence also indicates that an isolated act, falling within the 
  definition of the &quot;practice of law,&quot; is not a violation of the Act. 
  The impugned conduct must be carried out &quot;frequently, customarily, or habitually&quot;: 
  Rex ex rel. Smith v. Ott, [1950] O.R. 493-503 (C.A.); The Apothecaries Company 
  v. Jones, [1893] 1 Q.B. 89; R. v. Campbell and Upper-Canada Business Administrators 
  Ltd. (1974), 3 O.R. (2d) 402 (Prov. Ct., Crim. Div.).</p> <P>
  [12] The evidence in this case supported the inference that the appellant was 
  providing ongoing legal advice to members of the public in two separate matters. 
  In our view, it was open to the application judge to conclude that the conduct 
  of the appellant amounted to practising law or acting as a lawyer, contrary 
  to s. 50(1) of the Act.</p> <P>
  [13] The appellant concedes that a viva voce hearing is not required before 
  an injunction may issue.</p> <P>
  [14] Accordingly we would dismiss the appeal with costs fixed in the amount 
  of $3,000. </p>
