<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of counselling to commit the indictable offence 
  of trafficking and sentenced to two years consecutive to the sentence being 
  served.</p>
<p>
  [2] The sentencing judge relied on a joint submission by the Crown and duty 
  counsel that the sentence should be two years. In making submissions, the Crown 
  referred to the case of &quot;Jason English&quot; as establishing that two years 
  was the appropriate range. However we are advised that the offence in English 
  related to a much greater quantity and involved hashish.</p>
<p>
  [3] In our view, the sentencing judge erred in principle in accepting that two 
  years was the appropriate range for this type of offence. An appropriate range 
  for this type of offence is between six and twelve months. In saying this, we 
  observe that: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) the drug in the instant case was marijuana;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the quantity of sixteen grams was small; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the record is clear that the drugs were for the appellant's 
  personal use. See R. v. Voykin [1996] A.J. No. 1100 (Alta. Q.B.).</p>
<p>
  [4] Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the sentence is reduced 
  to six months consecutive.</p>
