<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is a Crown appeal against an acquittal. The respondent, Richard MacKay, 
  was charged with sexual assault and tried by judge and jury. The charges arose 
  out of several incidents in which the respondent was said to have sexually assaulted 
  his common-law spouse. MacKay represented himself at trial.</p>
<p> [2] The complainant met MacKay when she was 19 and within three months of 
  their relationship, she became pregnant. Within a week of knowing she was pregnant, 
  she alleged MacKay began to hurt her when they had sex. Specifically, the complainant 
  testified that MacKay would choke her, strangle her and pull her hair during 
  sex. She made it clear to him that she wanted him to stop doing this to her 
  but he never did. </p>
<p> [3] The complainant said she left MacKay three times because of his abusive 
  behaviour. The last time she left, MacKay&#8217;s mother, Gloria MacKay, confronted 
  the complainant. The complainant reported this confrontation to the police, 
  which led to further inquiries, and finally to charges being laid against the 
  respondent.</p>
<p> [4] At trial, MacKay did not cross-examine the complainant and did not testify. 
  He did not call any evidence in his defence. </p>
<p> [5] During the pre-charge discussion, the trial judge stated that there was 
  no evidence about where the incidents were alleged to have occurred. The trial 
  Crown admitted to the &#8220;oversight&#8221;. MacKay would not concede the 
  issue of jurisdiction of the alleged offences. </p>
<p> [6] The trial Crown then applied to re-open the case. The Crown wanted to 
  re-call the complainant, who was available to testify, to ask her where the 
  alleged incidents occurred. MacKay made no submissions.</p>
<p> [7] The trial judge denied the Crown&#8217;s application to re-open the case. 
  She withdrew the case from the jury and entered a verdict of acquittal.</p>
<p> [8] In the circumstances of this case, the actual place of the offence was 
  not an essential element of the offence. The only issue was whether the court 
  had territorial jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the view of Crown counsel at trial 
  (not Ms. Crosbie) and the trial judge there was circumstantial evidence that 
  the offence took place in Ontario. At p. 29 of the transcript of her evidence, 
  the complainant said that she came to Ontario when she was 17. At p. 30 the 
  complainant stated that she worked for the respondent in Barrie and started 
  a relationship with him around that time when she was 19. At p. 39 she said 
  that following the sexual incident she went to the hospital. Again at p. 29 
  she said she went to Huronia District Hospital on July 4, 2000, and afterwards 
  that she packed her belongings that were in the garage of their home. There 
  was therefore no real need to re-open the case for the Crown to present evidence 
  of where the incident had taken place. </p>
<p> [9] Assuming it were necessary to re-open the case, this case falls within 
  the non-controversial exception recognized by Cory J. in R. v. G (S.G.) (1997), 
  116 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at pp. 208-209 in that the respondent would not 
  have been prejudiced through the admission of the proffered evidence. The trial 
  judge was concerned that this unrepresented accused would suffer prejudice if 
  the Crown were allowed to re-open the proceedings. In light of the proceedings 
  to that point, and the circumstantial evidence as to the place of the offence 
  that was already in the record, there was no prejudice. </p>
<p> [10] The Crown has also met its burden of showing that, absent the error in 
  this case, the verdict would not necessarily have been the same.</p>
<p> [11] Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, set aside the acquittal and direct 
  a new trial.</p>
