<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Helen MacLeod of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated November 9, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] With respect to issues numbered 1 and 3 we think that the points are substantially 
  covered by the appellant's counsel's admission set forth on page 113 of the 
  trial transcript. The trial judge made it clear that the admission was the basis 
  for letting State Farm out of the action. After this was done, any possible 
  damages attributable to contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiffs 
  could not be recovered from State Farm. Further, we see no clear indication 
  in the transcript that appellants' counsel made any reference to the admission 
  being qualified by a finding of contributory negligence against the plaintiffs. 
  In any event, the trial judge found that the research materials &quot;remained 
  there for four years, unharmed, in a dry and safe environment&quot;. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] With respect to issue number 2, we think that the research materials had 
  undoubted value. The trial judgemade the following finding:</p>
<p class="indent">I am satisfied that the slides and negatives had significant 
  value to the plaintiff Dr. MacKenzie, both by way of their availability to him 
  for his potential continuing research and in addition for his current academic 
  teaching purposes.<br>
</p>
<p>Accordingly, we do not think that the trial judge erred in her assessment of 
  the damages for their loss.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] With respect to issue number 4, the appellants referred to the pre-trial 
  order after the evidence was concluded. At this stage, we do not think that 
  the trial judge erred in her disposition of this matter.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] With respect to the costs order in favour of State Farm, in the circumstances 
  of this case, particularly the failure of Co-operators in a clear case to admit 
  liability until the opening of the trial, we do not think that the trial judge 
  erred in the exercise of her discretion.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] For these reasons, we do not give effect to any of the grounds of appeal. 
  The appeal is dismissed with costs. [Submissions made on the amount of costs.] 
  The costs are fixed on a partial indemnity basis in the amount of $7,500 inclusive 
  of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
