<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The only issue in this appeal is whether it was open to the trial judge 
  to find as a fact that the certificate of a qualified technician given to the 
  appellant by the arresting officer was a copy pursuant to s. 258(7) of the Criminal 
  Code. For reasons that follow, in our view, it was. </p>
<p>
  [2] Before setting out those reasons, we wish to make it clear that in order 
  to meet the requirements of s. 258(7), a provision that addresses the admissibility 
  of the certificate into evidence, it is only necessary that the trial judge 
  be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the certificate given to the 
  accused is a copy. With respect, the learned Justice on appeal erred in applying 
  the criminal standard of proof to that question.</p>
<p>
  [3] With respect to the trial judge's finding that the appellant did receive 
  a copy of the certificate, in our view, the evidence of the arresting officer 
  amply supported it. In chief, the officer testified that he looked at the documents 
  and made sure that the copy was exactly the same as the original. In cross-examination, 
  he went on to say that while he did not compare the original and the copy &quot;word 
  for word&quot; or &quot;letter by letter&quot;, he did &quot;read through just 
  to make sure that they were the same.&quot; In addition to this evidence, in 
  response to a question as to how he knew it was a copy, the officer responded 
  that &quot;[it was] printed out right after [the other one] was printed out.&quot; 
  </p>
<p>
  [4] In our view, either aspect of the officer's evidence was sufficient to allow 
  the trial judge to make the finding he did and admit the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [5] Accordingly, we are respectfully of the view that the summary conviction 
  appeal judge erred in reversing the trial judge's finding. In the result, leave 
  to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and the conviction and sentence 
  imposed at trial are restored.</p>
