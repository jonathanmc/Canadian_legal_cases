<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The respondent, Virginia Ann MacLeod alleged that a property jointly owned 
  by her former husband and the appellant was fraudulently conveyed to the appellant 
  alone to defeat Ms. MacLeod's interests as a creditor of her former husband. 
  The trial judge agreed and set aside the transaction.</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge identified the crucial factual issue at para. 25 of his 
  reasons:</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; the issue then to be determined is whether or not he 
  [Mr. MacLeod] had a real interest as opposed to simply paper title in 385 Markland 
  Drive.</p>
<p>[3] The trial judge reviewed the evidence relevant to that issue over several 
  paragraphs. His ultimate finding is at para. 33 of his reasons:</p>
<p class="indent">There can be no doubt, in my view, that as between Mac and Magnish 
  [the appellant] on one hand and the world at large on the other, the property 
  was owned by the two of them each has to a one-half interest as joint tenants.</p>
<p>[4] The trial judge's finding quoted above is a finding of fact. It is entitled 
  to deference unless based on a misapprehension of material evidence, a failure 
  to consider material evidence, or unless it can be characterized as unreasonable 
  on the totality of the evidence. The appellant has not established any misapprehension 
  of the evidence or any failure to consider relevant evidence and certainly on 
  this record the trial judge's finding cannot be characterized as unreasonable.</p>
<p>[5] With respect to question of costs, we think that the trial judge's order 
  as to costs as against the appellant adequately addresses the concerns that 
  appellant's counsel has raised about her potential liability for costs on various 
  motions brought against MacLeod. Her responsibility for those costs can be addressed 
  on the assessment ordered by Herold J.</p>
<p>[6] Costs are fixed in the amount of $5,000, inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
