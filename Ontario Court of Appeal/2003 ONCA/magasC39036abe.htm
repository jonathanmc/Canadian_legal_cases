<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] With respect to the learned motions judge, we are of the view that there 
  were genuine issues of fact and credibility that required a trial for determination. 
  Expressed succinctly, the appellant has satisfied us that on this record, there 
  is evidence both direct and circumstantial, which could reasonably support the 
  elements of the various causes of action pleaded. Accordingly, the appellant 
  is entitled to a trial. The appeal is therefore allowed and the motions for 
  summary judgment are dismissed.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] We note that although the appellant is an undischarged bankrupt, the respondents, 
  before us, did not challenge her right to proceed with her appeals.<br>
</p>
<P>[3] The appellant is entitled to her costs of the motions below and the appeal 
  in the amount of $22,500 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
