<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>The Appeal</p>
<p>
  [1] We accept the proposition that there should be a contextual approach in 
  assessing whether an employee has been dismissed for just cause. The trial judge 
  in this case followed such an approach. He reviewed at length the history of 
  the relationship between the appellant and the respondent that culminated in 
  the termination of the appellant&#8217;s employment on September 4, 1999. Following 
  that review, he found (at para. 56 of his reasons) that the appellant had breached 
  the respondent&#8217;s policies and directives on a number of occasions and 
  that, "after the events of August and September 1999, [the respondent] 
  was completely justified in dismissing the appellant for just cause". 
  The events to which that reference applies include the unauthorized posting 
  of a sign by the appellant on the store door that the store was closed "due 
  to owner/management dispute", the appellant&#8217;s fax to the respondent 
  that the entire staff of the Ottawa store had tendered their resignations when, 
  in fact, no such resignations had been tendered, and the appellant&#8217;s advice 
  to the respondent that the store had been closed and would remain closed. </p>
<p>
  [2] We see no error in the trial judge&#8217;s conclusion that these incidents, 
  when viewed against the backdrop of the appellant&#8217;s prolonged record of 
  insubordination, constituted just cause entitling the respondent to terminate 
  his employment without notice.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant also submitted that the trial judge made factual errors in 
  his review of the evidence concerning the policy breaches and that he failed 
  to consider relevant evidence. We find no material misapprehension of the evidence 
  and are satisfied that the trial judge&#8217;s failure to refer specifically 
  to parts of the evidence does not warrant a conclusion that he failed to consider 
  that evidence.</p>
<p>
  [4] We would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  The Cross-Appeal</p>
<p>
  [5] The respondent seeks leave to cross-appeal the trial judge&#8217;s order 
  for the costs of the trial. In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge indicated 
  that, had he awarded damages to the appellant for wrongful dismissal, the amount 
  of such damages would have been $23,358.77. This amount was less than the $25,000 
  ceiling that then applied to cases that were subject to the Simplified Procedure 
  provisions of Rule 76.</p>
<p>
  [6] The trial lasted 14 days and a number of witnesses were called. Counsel 
  for the respondent filed a bill of costs, prepared by reference to the costs 
  grid, totalling $113,647.14. In his written decision as to costs, the trial 
  judge specifically considered the nature of the action, the complexity of the 
  case both factually and legally, and the relationship between the respondent&#8217;s 
  success as compared with its exposure, and fixed its costs at $60,000, inclusive 
  of disbursements and G.S.T. In our view, that assessment of costs was appropriate 
  in the exercise of the trial judge&#8217;s overriding discretion under rule 
  57.01, and we would not disturb it.</p>
<p>
  [7] Leave to cross-appeal against costs is granted, but the appeal against costs 
  is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  Costs in this court</p>
<p> [8] The respondent is entitled to its costs of the appeal, and the appellant 
  is entitled to his costs of the cross-appeal. Having heard the submissions of 
  counsel, we direct that their respective costs be set-off against each other, 
  and we award to the respondent the net figure of $9,000.00, inclusive of disbursements 
  and G.S.T.</p>
