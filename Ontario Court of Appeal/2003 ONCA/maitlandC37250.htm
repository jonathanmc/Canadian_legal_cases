<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice R.G.E. Hunter dated August 30, 2001.</p>
<p>
  ABELLA J.A. (Dissenting):</p>
<p>
  [1] The issue in this appeal is whether someone who has been granted a building 
  permit under the Building Code Act, 1992, S.O. 1992 c. 23, can rely on the defence 
  of officially induced error when the resulting construction is alleged to violate 
  the Conservation Authorities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.27.</p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [2] Cranbrook Swine Inc. (&quot;Cranbrook&quot;) is in the business of hog farming. 
  Charles D. Terpstra is a director and officer of the company. In 1999, he hired 
  Landmark Builders Ltd. (&quot;Landmark&quot;), a construction company, to be 
  the contractor for the design and construction of two barns and a liquid manure 
  storage tank.</p>
<p>
  [3] Cranbrook and Landmark obtained building permits for the construction from 
  the chief building official of the Township of Morris on August 25, 1999. </p>
<p>
  [4] The construction of the manure storage tank came to the attention of an 
  employee of the Maitland Valley Conservation Authority (the &quot;Authority&quot;). 
  The employee, concerned about the location of the tank, contacted the chief 
  building official of the Township of Morris to arrange to visit the construction 
  site. </p>
<p>
  [5] His visit persuaded him that the construction might be a violation of the 
  Conservation Authorities Act. As a result, the Authority consulted its hydrologist. 
  The resulting memo, dated September 14, 1999, concluded that &quot;the placement 
  of a liquid manure facility at the location currently under construction should 
  not be considered as acceptable under the Authority regulation policies&quot;. 
  This led the Authority, on September 15, 1999, to accept a recommendation from 
  its general manager that a violation notice regarding the construction of the 
  tank be issued, on the grounds that the tank was located within a water resource 
  area or wetland. </p>
<p>
  [6] The notice, sent by the Authority on September 16, 1999 informed Cranbrook, 
  Terpstra and Landmark that the construction was a violation of the Conservation 
  Authorities Act because it was taking place in a wetland area without prior 
  approval from the Authority.</p>
<p>
  [7] On the same day that the Authority sent the notice of violation, a stop 
  work order was issued by the Township of Morris. No construction has taken place 
  at the site since September 16, 1999.</p>
<p>
  [8] On November 26, 1999, charges were brought by the Authority against Cranbrook, 
  Terpstra and Landmark. The offence alleged was a violation of s. 3(a) of Ontario 
  Regulation 22/91 of the Conservation Act which provides that, absent permission 
  from the Maitland Valley Conservation Authority, no person shall</p>
<p class="indent"> construct any building or permit any building to be constructed 
  in or on a pond or swamp or in any area susceptible to flooding during a regional 
  storm</p>
<p>
  [9] At the trial before a Justice of the Peace, the defence led no evidence, 
  instead bringing three motions for non-suit. The first motion was that the prosecution 
  had failed to present a prima facie case against Mr. Terpstra, personally. The 
  argument on the second motion was that the issuance of a building permit under 
  the Building Code Act provided a defence to the charges under the Conservation 
  Authorities Act. The third motion was that the area in which the storage tank 
  was being constructed was not a &quot;swamp&quot; or &quot;wetland&quot;. There 
  was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the owner or contractor, nor was 
  there any evidence that the building permit was invalid.</p>
<p>
  [10] The Justice of the Peace allowed the third motion on the grounds that the 
  prosecution had failed to establish that the specific area on which the tank 
  was constructed was a &quot;swamp&quot; within the meaning of s. 3(a) of the 
  Construction Regulation under the Conservation Authorities Act. Although he 
  was satisfied that the area adjacent to the construction site was a swamp, he 
  concluded that there was no evidence that the actual site &quot;was or had been 
  a swamp&quot;, finding that &quot;it is supposition that because the area adjacent 
  to the cleared area was swamp, that therefore&#133;the site where the tank was&#133;had 
  been swamp&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [11] On appeal, Hunter J. overturned the finding that the construction site 
  was not a swamp, but acquitted the owner and contractor on the grounds that 
  they were entitled to rely, primarily, on the defence of officially induced 
  error. He summarized his conclusions as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> There is no suggestion whatsoever that the Respondents at any 
  time acted in other than a reasonable manner; they acted in good faith. They 
  went to the authorities and obtained a building permit to construct the holding 
  tank. After construction commenced, it came to the notice of the conservation 
  authorities that construction was possibly taking place in the area of a swamp 
  and was therefore prohibited. Tests were done and this supported the beliefs 
  of the conservation authority and as a result these charges were brought.</p>
<p class="indent">I am satisfied that the Respondents are entitled to rely on 
  the defence of officially induced error. Having taken the proper steps, there 
  is no case law that I am aware of or that has been brought to my attention that 
  there was an obligation on them, having obtained the necessary documentation, 
  to go to any other authorities to check to see whether or not it was permissible 
  to construct the holding tank. They did all that was required of them, as I 
  say, in good faith. There is nothing to suggest that the building permit was 
  issued other than in good faith. They were entitled to rely on that building 
  permit. The conservation authorities cannot now expect to find favour in this 
  court when charges are laid against the Respondents for breach of the Conservation 
  Act (sic.). At the risk of repetition, the Respondents did all they had to do 
  and they cannot now be held liable nor responsible for a possible error committed 
  by the issuing authorities of the building permit. (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p>
  [12] The Authority, and the Attorney General for Ontario as Intervenor, applied 
  for and were granted leave to appeal this decision pursuant to s. 131 of the 
  Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990 c. P. 33, which states:</p>
<p class="indent"> 131(1) A defendant or the prosecutor or the Attorney General 
  by way of intervention may appeal from the judgment of the court to the Court 
  of Appeal, with leave of a judge of the Court of Appeal on special grounds, 
  upon any question of law alone or as to sentence.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) No leave to appeal shall be granted under subsection (1) 
  unless the judge of the Court of Appeal considers that in the particular circumstances 
  of the case it is essential in the public interest or for the due administration 
  of justice that leave be granted.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) No appeal or review lies from a decision on a motion for 
  leave to appeal under subsection (1).</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [13] The only issue in this appeal is whether the respondents were entitled 
  to rely on the defences of officially induced error, estoppel or due diligence 
  in responding to the strict liability offence with which they were charged. 
  In my view, the facts in this case support a defence of officially induced error. 
  Given the role of the chief building official and the significance of a building 
  permit under the Building Code Act, it was open to the trial judge, notwithstanding 
  that the defence called no evidence, to conclude on a balance of probabilities 
  that the owner reasonably relied on the issuance of the building permit as an 
  assurance of the legality of the construction of the storage tank.</p>
<p>
  [14] There was no evidence to contradict a finding of reasonable reliance. On 
  the contrary, there was evidence to support an inference that it is more likely 
  than not that the respondents were unaware of any problems from the perspective 
  of the Conservation Authorities Act. There was uncertainty over whether these 
  were, in fact, &quot;wetlands&quot;, and evidence that the local practice was 
  for a building permit applicant to apply to the Conservation Authority only 
  when directed to do so by the chief building official. </p>
<p>
  [15] The methodology for ascertaining whether a proposed construction is in 
  accordance with the Building Code Act, is to apply for a permit. Section 8(11) 
  of the Building Code Act states: </p>
<p class="indent"> No person shall construct or demolish a building or cause a 
  building to be constructed or demolished except in accordance with this Act 
  and the building code.</p>
<p>
  [16] It would have been redundant for the owner to be required, in the absence 
  of evidence to the contrary, to state the obvious, namely, that he applied for 
  a permit in order to meet the applicable requirements before he started any 
  construction, and that he relied on the issuance of that permit to conclude 
  that he was entitled, by law, to build.</p>
<p>
  [17] This case turns, in my view, on the wording of ss. 8(1), and (2)(a), of 
  the Building Code Act, which provide:</p>
<p class="indent"> 8.(1) No person shall construct or demolish a building or cause 
  a building to be constructed or demolished unless a permit has been issued therefor 
  by the chief building official.</p>
<p class="indent">s. 8(2) The chief building official shall issue a permit under 
  subsection (1) unless,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the proposed building, construction or demolition will contravene 
  this Act or the building code or any other applicable law [emphasis added];</p>
<p>
  [18] The phrase &quot;applicable law&quot; is defined on O. Reg. 403/97 to the 
  Building Code Act (s. 1.1.3.2.) as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> Applicable law means, for the purposes of Section 8 of the 
  Act, any general or special Act, and all regulations and by-laws, enacted thereunder, 
  which prohibit the proposed construction or demolition of the building unless 
  the Act, regulation or by-law is complied with.</p>
<p>
  [19] These provisions, in combination, stand for the proposition that no building 
  or construction can take place in Ontario without a building permit, and that 
  no such permit will be issued by a local chief building official if the proposed 
  construction will contravene any applicable law. </p>
<p>
  [20] The appellants acknowledge that the Conservation Authorities Act and the 
  construction regulations enacted under it are &quot;applicable law&quot; within 
  the meaning of s. 8(2) of the Building Code Act. That makes compliance with 
  its provisions part of what the chief building official is required to consider 
  in deciding whether to grant a building permit. The granting of the permit is, 
  therefore, on its face, a determination by the chief building official that, 
  among other statutes, the relevant provisions of the Conservation Authorities 
  Act have been complied with. </p>
<p>
  [21] In this case, the owner was required by s. 8(1) of the Building Code Act 
  to get a permit prior to building the storage tank. Under the scheme of the 
  Act, anyone applying for a building permit under the Building Code Act can reasonably 
  expect to have the permit refused if the proposed construction violates any 
  applicable law; conversely, it seems to me, an applicant can reasonably assume 
  that if the permit has been issued, the chief building official is of the view 
  that no such contravention exists. </p>
<p>
  [22] The owner and contractor in this case sought permission from the person 
  with the statutory authority to grant it if all applicable laws are complied 
  with - the chief building official of the Township of Morris. It was therefore 
  reasonable for the recipients of what was conceded at the trial to be a valid 
  building permit, to rely on the assumption that since the permit was issued, 
  no applicable law, including the Conservation Authorities Act, was being contravened. 
  </p>
<p>
  [23] These circumstances make the defence of &quot;officially induced error&quot; 
  available. This defence received appellate endorsement from Lacourci&egrave;re 
  J.A. in R. v. Cancoil Thermal Corporation and Parkinson (1986), 11 C.C.E.L. 
  219 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 231, who explained it as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> The defence of &quot;officially induced error&quot; is available 
  as a defence to an alleged violation of a regulatory statute where an accused 
  has reasonably relied upon the erroneous legal opinion or advice of an official 
  who is responsible for the administration or enforcement of the particular law. 
  In order for the accused to successfully raise this defence, he must show that 
  he relied on the erroneous legal opinion of the official and that his reliance 
  was reasonable. The reasonableness will depend upon several factors including 
  the efforts he made to ascertain the proper law, the complexity or obscurity 
  of the law, the position of the official who gave the advice, and the clarity, 
  definitiveness and reasonableness of the advice given. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="indent">I agree with the following statement made by Professor Barton 
  [in &quot;Officially Induced Error as a Criminal Defence: A Preliminary Look&quot; 
  (1979-80), 22 Crim. L.Q. 314], at p. 331:</p>
<p class="indent15">&quot;Where the advice is given by an official who has the job 
  of administering the particular statute, and where the actor relies on this 
  advice and commits what is in fact an offence, even if the agency cannot be 
  estopped does it follow that the actor should not be excused? To do so is not 
  to condone an illegality or say that the agency is estopped into a position 
  of illegality, but to recognize that the advice was illegal but excuse the actor 
  because he acted reasonably and does not deserve punishment.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [24] In Jorgensen and 913719 Ontario Limited v. The Queen (1995), 129 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 510 (S.C.C.) at p. 517, Lamer C.J.C. justifies this defence as an exception 
  to the principle that ignorance of the law does not excuse the commission of 
  a criminal offence, in the following way:</p>
<p class="indent"> The number of laws under which any person in Canada may incur 
  criminal liability is nothing short of astounding. While knowledge of the law 
  is to be encouraged, it is certainly reasonable for someone to assume he knows 
  the law after consulting a representative of the state acting in a capacity 
  which makes him expert on that particular subject.</p>
<p>
  [25] Before the defence can succeed, the recipients of the building permit must 
  have considered the legal consequences of their actions, that is, whether their 
  conduct in constructing the tank might be illegal and, as a result, sought advice. 
  </p>
<p>
  [26] The most obvious reflection of an intention to ascertain whether building 
  the tank was legally permissible, was to apply for a building permit. Because, 
  as s. 8(11) states, it is illegal to construct or demolish a building except 
  in accordance with the Building Code Act, and because, under s. 8(1), that requires 
  the issuance of a building permit from the local chief building official, seeking 
  a building permit from the chief building official is therefore seeking advice 
  about whether the proposed construction is legal. A rejection means that the 
  construction is not legally permissible. It follows that the issuance of a valid 
  building permit is prima facie evidence of a positive response to the 'advice' 
  sought.</p>
<p>
  [27] The question then is whether the advice came from an appropriate official. 
  The appellants argue that the only appropriate official who can give advice 
  about whether any construction in the Township of Morris violates the Conservation 
  Authorities Act, is someone in the Authority, not the chief building official.</p>
<p>
  [28] This proposition undermines what appears to be the legislative scheme for 
  ensuring the necessary compliance with all relevant laws before any construction 
  takes place in Ontario. </p>
<p>
  [29] The Building Code Act sets standards for all construction and building 
  projects in Ontario. The scheme it supervises for the issuance of building permits 
  is a mandatory one. The local chief building official is appointed, along with 
  the necessary inspectors, by the council of each municipality, the body entrusted 
  by s. 3 of the Building Code Act with enforcement responsibility. </p>
<p>
  [30] There are, the appellant acknowledges, at least nine statutes affecting 
  the use of land in Ontario, including regulations for environmental protection 
  - the Building Code Act, the Conservation Authorities Act, the Environmental 
  Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.18, the Environmental Protection Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. E. 19, the Fire Marshals Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F. 17, the Municipal 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M. 45, the Ontario Municipal Board Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  O.28, the Ontario Water Resources Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.40, and the Planning 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13. </p>
<p>
  [31] Each of these statutes sets out standards which may affect the decision 
  to permit construction on a given parcel of land. But no construction can take 
  place in Ontario unless the local chief building official issues a building 
  permit. </p>
<p>
  [32] The application form for a building permit states that &quot;Sufficient 
  information shall be submitted with each application to enable the chief building 
  official to determine whether or not the proposed work will conform with the 
  Building Code Act and regulations thereunder and any other applicable law&quot; 
  [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [33] This obliges the chief building official to ensure that he or she has all 
  relevant information from the applicant to determine whether, among other things, 
  environmental concerns under relevant legislation have been satisfied. And if, 
  based on the information provided in good faith, an error has been made, his 
  or her decision can be reviewed under the Building Code Act. But until the issuance 
  of a permit is challenged, as it was in this case by the Authority, individuals 
  acting in good faith should reasonably be able to rely on it for the assumption 
  that they are in compliance with their legal obligations.</p>
<p>
  [34] It would be, it seems to me, an untenable proposition to suggest that, 
  absent a separate and specific confirmation in connection with each of the approximately 
  nine applicable statutes, the holder of a building permit cannot reasonably 
  proceed on the assumption that a chief building official has complied with his 
  or her statutory duty. This duty is discharged by the chief building official 
  ensuring that the proposed construction is in accordance with all applicable 
  laws. </p>
<p>
  [35] Part of this responsibility includes directing an applicant for a building 
  permit to any additional authority for prior approvals, where necessary. In 
  fact, there was evidence from Phil Beard, an employee at the Authority for 21 
  years and the general manager and secretary-treasurer during the relevant time 
  period, that, in the normal course, a builder or property owner would only make 
  an application for a construction permit to the Conservation Authority after 
  having been directed or advised to do so by the chief building official. During 
  re-examination, the following exchange took place regarding the local practice 
  followed by landowners and builders in making an application for a construction 
  permit:</p>
<p class="indent"> [Mr. Beard]: They're usually directed to get our permit first, 
  by the building official except in the municipality of North Perth, we have 
  an experimental program going, where they can apply jointly for permission under 
  our regulation and under the Building Code. (Emphasis added)</p>
<p class="indent">[Prosecutor]: I'm confused by this. I just want make sure that 
  I understand. If an application for a permit is made to the Conservation Authority 
  under the construction regulation, usually what happens is the applicant is 
  referred by the Municipality's building department to the Authority to get their 
  permission first?</p>
<p class="indent">[Mr. Beard] That's correct&#133;If they go there first. Yes 
  that's right. </p>
<p class="indent">[Prosecutor]: Right. So, the most applications to the Authority 
  for permission to construct are made directly by the landowner or contractor. 
  Is that normal?</p>
<p class="indent">[Mr. Beard] Yes, that's correct. The landowner or agent, yes.</p>
<p>
  [36] What that means is that while it would have been open to the owner and 
  contractor to get advice about whether the tank was permissible directly from 
  the Authority or any of the other agencies with jurisdiction over land use in 
  Ontario, it was, given the language and scheme of s. 8 of the Building Code 
  Act, at least as reasonable for them to seek centralized advice from the chief 
  building official of Morris Township. He was, after all, the only official in 
  a position to grant or withhold the permit without which the construction would 
  have been illegal. He was, therefore, an official whose duty it was, prior to 
  making a decision, to determine whether the proposed construction constituted 
  a potential violation of the Conservation Authorities Act requiring consideration 
  by the Authority. Even if the Authority had approved the construction, however, 
  it would still have been open to the chief building official to refuse the permit 
  if he felt there was a contravention of the laws of another constituent statute 
  in the regulatory constellation.</p>
<p>
  [37] The chief building official in Morris Township, in other words, was an 
  appropriate official on whom to rely about whether the construction would comply 
  with all applicable laws, since, if it did not, no permit would have been issued. 
  The reasonableness of Cranbrook and Landmark's reliance on the building permit 
  flowed not only from their statutory entitlement to rely on the advice given 
  by the chief building official in the form of that permit, but also from their 
  statutory requirement to do so.</p>
<p>
  [38] In addition, there was evidence that there was no mechanism in place during 
  the relevant time period to inform property owners directly that their lands 
  may fall under the jurisdiction of the Authority. According to the testimony 
  of Mr. Beard and a former employee of the Authority, the only mechanisms in 
  Morris Township for providing information on property affected by the Construction 
  Regulations during the relevant time period were a responsive solicitor's inquiry 
  service and a general mailing sent to real estate agents, lawyers and chief 
  building officials. Mr. Beard testified that in the early eighties, when the 
  first Construction Regulation was approved, the Authority worked with municipalities 
  and planning departments to prepare maps for them that outlined all of the areas 
  that were regulated by it. The maps and policies were put together along with 
  explanatory notes in all the by-laws that specifically mentioned the Authority 
  and its regulations. The municipalities were obliged to send a copy of every 
  zoning by-law to every ratepayer in the municipality, so they could see how 
  their own properties had been zoned and would also receive information about 
  how the Authority's regulations affected their property. </p>
<p>
  [39] These efforts were discontinued as a result of reduced provincial funding 
  in 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>
  [40] This does not take away from the local Conservation Authority's responsibility 
  for enforcing the significant legislative mandate of protecting the natural 
  resources of the watershed within defined territorial jurisdictions throughout 
  Ontario. Rather, it points to the clear statutory direction in the Building 
  Code Act that the local chief building official should also play a significant 
  role.</p>
<p>
  [41] Nor do I mean to suggest that in such a complex and interrelated regulatory 
  scheme, a building permit can never be issued in error. The Building Code Act, 
  in fact, anticipates this possibility by providing a remedy through, for example, 
  the revocation of a permit under s. 8(10) of the Building Code Act. The relevant 
  portions of s. 8(10) state:</p>
<p class="indent"> 8. (10) Subject to section 25, the chief building official 
  may revoke a permit issued under this Act,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) if it was issued on mistaken, false or incorrect information; 
  [or]</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (d) if it was issued in error</p>
<p>
  [42] In addition, a challenge can be brought under s. 25 of the Building Code 
  Act, which gives access to an expeditious judicial determination about whether 
  the issuance of the permit was proper. The section states, in part:</p>
<p class="indent">
  25. (1) Any person who considers themselves aggrieved by an order or decision 
  made by an inspector or chief building official under this Act or the regulations, 
  except a decision not to issue a conditional permit under subsection 8(3), may, 
  within twenty days after the order or decision is made, appeal the order or 
  decision to a judge of the Ontario Court (General Division) [Superior Court 
  of Justice].</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">
  25. (4) If an appeal is made under this section, the judge shall hold a hearing 
  and may rescind or affirm the order or decision of the inspector or chief building 
  official or take such action as the judge considers the inspector or chief building 
  official ought to take in accordance with this Act and the regulations and, 
  for such purpose, may substitute his or her opinion for that of the inspector 
  or chief building official.</p>
<p class="center">
  &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">
  25. (7) An appeal under subsection (1) does not stay the operation of the order 
  or decision appealed from but a judge may, on such terms as are just, stay the 
  operation of the order or decision until the disposition of the appeal. 1992, 
  c. 23, s. 25(7); 2000, c. 26, Sch. K, s. 1.</p>
<p>
  [43] The remaining issue is whether the advice given by the chief building official 
  in the form of a building permit was reasonable in the circumstances. On the 
  theory that members of the public relying on advice from public officials have 
  less knowledge of the law than those officials, the threshold of reasonableness 
  is not a high one. As Lamer C.J.C. stated in Jorgensen, at p. 527:</p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;It is sufficient, therefore, to say that if an appropriate official is 
  consulted, the advice obtained will be presumed to be reasonable unless it appears 
  on its face to be utterly unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  [44] The record reveals that it was not immediately clear to the Authority whether 
  the site was within their jurisdiction. Consultation with the Authority's hydrologist 
  was necessary before it could be determined that the site was a wetland feature, 
  and site visits had to be made by the hydrologist and an ecologist in order 
  to verify this. As well, there was no evidence that tests had ever been conducted 
  on this site, and no evidence that the property owner in this case had previously 
  been alerted to the fact that the property may be under the jurisdiction of 
  the Authority. </p>
<p>
  [45] It seems to me that, given the conflicting evidence, it could not be said 
  that it was unreasonable for the permit to be issued and for its recipients 
  to rely on it. The Justice of the Peace at trial, in fact, after hearing all 
  of the evidence, concluded that the site was not a swamp. I appreciate that 
  this finding was overturned by Justice Hunter on appeal, but that does not make 
  the issuance of the permit, or reliance on it, unreasonable in these circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [46] No construction of the tank took place until Cranbrook, Terpstra and Landmark 
  ascertained, by applying for a building permit, that they were legally entitled 
  to do so. Permission came in the form of a building permit, an official document 
  which, based on s. 8 of the Building Code Act, authorized construction only 
  if all relevant legal requirements are satisfied. The owner and contractor were 
  therefore entitled, reasonably, to rely on the advice implicit in the issuance 
  of the permit, namely, that they were violating no applicable law in building 
  on the site. </p>
<p>
  [47] I appreciate that the Authority has been assigned a highly sensitive and 
  significant statutory mandate which it is obliged to pursue with protective 
  rigour. But where, as here, the facts reveal a reasonable reliance on what proved 
  to be a mistake on the part of the chief building official, the defence of officially 
  induced error can be justified.</p>
<p>
  [48] I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p> &quot;R.S. Abella J.A.&quot;<br>
  MACPHERSON J.A.:</p>
<p>
  [49] I have had the opportunity to read the reasons prepared by my colleague, 
  Abella J.A. I regret that I do not agree with her proposed disposition of the 
  appeal.</p>
<p>
  [50] I agree with my colleague's summary of the facts and statement of the issue. 
  I also agree with her conclusions in relation to several components of the defence 
  of officially induced error. However, in the end, I disagree with her analysis 
  concerning the reliance component of the defence which, regrettably, leads me 
  to a different proposed disposition of the appeal. </p>
<p> [51] There is a recognized defence of officially induced error.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  It is available in criminal prosecutions: see R. v. Jorgensen (1995), 129 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 510 (S.C.C.). It is also a potential defence of an accused charged with 
  violating a regulatory statute: see R. v. Cancoil Thermal Corporation et al. 
  (1986), 11 C.C.E.L. 219 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [52] There are five elements or components in the defence - (1) the accused 
  must have considered the legal consequences of its actions and sought legal 
  advice, (2) the legal advice obtained must have been given by an appropriate 
  official, (3) the legal advice was erroneous, (4) the persons receiving the 
  advice relied on it, and (5) the reliance was reasonable: see Jorgensen at pp. 
  525 27 and Cancoil at p. 231.</p>
<p>
  [53] My colleague concludes that all five of these elements are present in this 
  case and that the summary conviction appeal judge was correct to apply the defence 
  on the non suit and acquit the respondents. I agree with my colleague's conclusions 
  with respect to elements (1), (2) and (3), disagree with her conclusion relating 
  to element (4), and do not reach element (5).</p>
<p>
  [54] In my view, the respondents' invocation of the defence of officially induced 
  error founders on the reliance element. The summary conviction appeal judge 
  dealt with reliance in this fashion:</p>
<p class="indent">
  There is no suggestion whatsoever that the Respondents at any time acted in 
  other than a reasonable manner; they acted in good faith.</p>
<p class="center"> . . . . .</p>
<p class="indent">
  I am satisfied that the Respondents are entitled to rely on the defence of officially 
  induced error . . . They did all that was required of them, as I say, in good 
  faith.</p>
<p>
  In other words, in the absence of evidence of bad faith, the summary conviction 
  appeal judge assumed that the respondents relied in good faith on the advice 
  of the chief building official.</p>
<p>
  [55] On appeal, my colleague draws a similar inference. In the 'Background' 
  section of her reasons, she states: &quot;There was no evidence of bad faith 
  on the part of the owner or contractor&quot;. In the 'Analysis' section of the 
  judgment, she reasons:</p>
<p class="indent">
  [The application form for a building permit] obliges the Chief Building Official 
  to ensure that he or she has all relevant information from the applicant to 
  determine whether, among other things, environmental concerns under relevant 
  legislation have been satisfied. And if, based on the information provided in 
  good faith, an error has been made, his or her decision can be reviewed under 
  the Building Code Act. But until the issuance of a permit is challenged, as 
  it was in this case by the Authority, individuals acting in good faith should 
  reasonably be able to rely on it for the assumption that they are in compliance 
  with their legal obligations. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [56] With respect, I do not agree that good faith, and therefore reliance, can 
  be inferred from the absence of evidence of bad faith. The respondents brought 
  their motion for a non suit at the conclusion of the Crown's case. They called 
  no evidence. Accordingly, there is no basis for concluding that their application 
  to the chief building official was made in good faith. Perhaps it was; however, 
  perhaps it was not. The point is that there is no way of knowing and, with respect, 
  it is wrong to infer good faith, just as it would be wrong to infer bad faith.</p>
<p>
  [57] I am especially unwilling to infer good faith and reliance on the facts 
  of this case and bearing in mind the statute in question. The respondents were 
  not applying for a building permit to construct a backyard deck. Rather, they 
  sought permission to construct a liquid pig manure storage tank 160 feet in 
  diameter and 12 feet deep. This storage tank would be located in rural Ontario 
  and, specifically, in a location where, it is clear from the exhibits, including 
  aerial photographs, there are obvious wetlands environmental concerns. This 
  simple fact implicates in turn the Conservation Authorities Act, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. C.27, which is a crucial provincial law with a stated purpose, in s. 20, 
  of furthering &quot;the conservation, restoration, development and management 
  of natural resources&quot;. In short, the reality of what the respondents propose 
  to build, and the clear nexus between the proposed structure and the Conservation 
  Authorities Act, suggest caution and vigilance.</p>
<p>
  [58] The onus to establish an affirmative defence rests on the party asserting 
  it. As expressed by Lacourci&egrave;re J.A. in Cancoil, &quot;it will be for 
  the trier of fact to decide whether the accused has proved, by a preponderance 
  of evidence, that he was misled by the inspector into thinking that [the accused's 
  conduct] would not be in contravention of the law&quot; (at p. 231). Or, as 
  put succinctly by Lamer J. in Jorgensen, &quot;the accused must demonstrate 
  reliance on the official advice&quot; (at p. 527).</p>
<p>
  [59] The respondents did not demonstrate reliance in the present case. They 
  brought a motion for a non suit, and said nothing. This placed the trial judge 
  and the summary conviction appeal judge in the same predicament as the trial 
  judge in R. v. Savard, [2001] O.J. No. 3350 (O.C.J.), who dealt with the reliance 
  component of the defence of officially induced error, at paras. 18 20:</p>
<p class="indent">
  And finally, for the defence of officially induced error to succeed, there must 
  be evidence that Mr. Savard did rely on the erroneous advice he claims that 
  he was given by his Member of Parliament. Quite simply, the court is unaware 
  of what was in Mr. Savard's mind. He did not testify at the trial, by choice, 
  and there is no other way for that determination to be made . . . .</p>
<p class="indent">
  . . . What was he thinking? How did he interpret the advice that he was given? 
  I cannot guess.</p>
<p class="indent">
  . . . Mr. Savard has failed to discharge the burden of proving that his conduct 
  was excused by an officially induced error.</p>
<p>
  [60] In summary, I do not think the respondents have met their burden to establish 
  the reliance element of the defence of officially induced error. The respondents 
  chose to bring a motion for a non suit/directed verdict at the conclusion of 
  the Crown's case. They led no evidence that they relied on the advice of the 
  chief building official as confirming compliance with the Conservation Authorities 
  Act. The respondents were in the best position, and had the legal obligation, 
  to satisfy the court that they acted in good faith and relied on the building 
  permit to establish compliance with the Conservation Authorities Act. They did 
  not do this; they remained silent on these matters. </p>
<p>
  [61] For the sake of completeness, I record that, in my view, there is no merit 
  to the respondents' arguments grounded in due diligence and estoppel.</p>
<p>
  [62] I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.</p>
<p>
  &quot;J. C. MacPherson J.A.&quot;</p>
<p>
  SIMMONS J.A. (concurring):</p>
<p> [63] I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleagues Abella 
  J.A. and MacPherson J.A. I agree with MacPherson J.A.'s statement that there 
  are five elements of the defence of officially induced error<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  and with his conclusions that, at the close of the prosecution's case, the respondents 
  had not made out the fourth element and that they did not reach the fifth element. 
  I therefore agree with his proposed disposition of this appeal and respectfully 
  disagree with the disposition proposed by my colleague Abella J.A. </p>
<p>
  [64] However, I respectfully disagree with my colleagues' finding that, at the 
  close of the prosecution's case, the respondents had satisfied the first three 
  elements of the defence of officially induced error. In addition, I conclude 
  that there was no air of reality to the defence at that point and, therefore, 
  that there was no basis for raising it. </p>
<p>
  [65] Dealing with the question of whether the respondents satisfied the first 
  three elements of the defence, for ease of reference, I will repeat MacPherson 
  J.A.'s summary of its elements: (1) the accused must have considered the legal 
  consequences of its actions and sought legal advice, (2) the legal advice obtained 
  must have been given by an appropriate official, (3) the legal advice was erroneous, 
  (4) the person receiving the advice relied on it, and (5) the reliance was reasonable.</p>
<p>
  [66] In order to satisfy the first three requirements of the defence, in my 
  view, it would be necessary that the respondents demonstrate three things that 
  were not addressed by the evidence at trial. First, that they turned their minds 
  specifically to the legal consequences of that part of their conduct that is 
  prohibited by the Conservation Authorities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.27, regulation. 
  Second, that they obtained erroneous advice from an official who they believed, 
  on reasonable grounds, was in a position to give advice concerning that issue. 
  Third, that they understood the advice they received to mean that the prohibited 
  aspect of their conduct was not illegal.</p>
<p>
  [67] Phrased more bluntly, I think it necessary that the respondents demonstrate: 
  (1) that they considered whether it was illegal to build a liquid manure holding 
  tank in a swamp; (2) that they obtained advice from an appropriate official 
  concerning that specific issue; and (3) that, as a result of the advice that 
  they obtained, they believed it was not illegal to build a liquid manure holding 
  tank in a swamp.</p>
<p>
  [68] None of the cases that were brought to our attention raised, in such precise 
  terms, the issue of what an accused must consider and understand in order to 
  meet the first three requirements of the defence of officially induced error. 
  Accordingly, I base my conclusion on the enunciated rationale for the defence, 
  which is non-blameworthy mistake as opposed to ignorance: see R. v. Jorgensen 
  (1995), 129 D.L.R. (4th) 510 (S.C.C.) at paras. 6-11 and paras. 25-31; and P.G. 
  Barton, &quot;Officially Induced Error as a Criminal Defence: A Preliminary 
  Look&quot; (1979-80), 22 C.L.Q. 314 at pp. 317-8 and p. 328. </p>
<p>
  [69] I rely in particular on the following comments of Lamer C.J.C in Jorgensen:</p>
<p class="indent"> Once it is determined that the error was one of law, the next 
  step is to demonstrate that the accused considered the legal consequences of 
  her actions. By requiring that an accused must have considered whether her conduct 
  might be illegal and sought advice as a consequence, we ensure that the incentive 
  for a responsible and informed citizenry is not undermined. It is insufficient 
  for an accused who wishes to benefit from this excuse to simply have assumed 
  that her conduct was permissible [emphasis added]<a href="#3">[3]</a>.<a name="r3"></a></p>
<p class="indent">Finally, to benefit from this excuse, the accused must demonstrate 
  reliance on the official advice. This can be shown, for example, by proving 
  that the advice was obtained before the actions in question were commenced and 
  by showing that the questions posed to the official were specifically tailored 
  to the accused's situation [emphasis added]<a href="#4">[4]</a>.<a name="r4"></a></p>
<p>
  [70] Although Lamer C.J.C.'s comments concerning &quot;specifically tailored&quot; 
  questions relate to the reliance component of his analysis, it goes without 
  saying that one would have to advert to the prohibited aspect of one's conduct 
  at some point in order to pose appropriate questions. </p>
<p>
  [71] In my view, if the respondents never considered whether there were legal 
  consequences of building a liquid manure tank in a swamp, and did not obtain 
  advice, from an appropriate official, which they understood related to that 
  issue, they demonstrate ignorance, not mistake, and they should not be entitled 
  to the benefit of this defence. Given that there was no evidence at trial dealing 
  with these specific issues, I conclude that there was no basis for holding that 
  the first three requirements of the defence were satisfied.</p>
<p> [72] I am mindful that it might be argued that the facts in Jorgensen do not 
  support my conclusions about what an accused person must consider and understand 
  in order to satisfy the first three requirements of the defence because, in 
  Jorgensen, the accused simply relied on Ontario Film Review Board approvals 
  and there was no evidence that he posed any &quot;specifically tailored&quot; 
  questions to an appropriate official. However, there was evidence in Jorgensen 
  that the accused told police that he purchased only videos that had been approved 
  by the Ontario Film Review Board<a href="#5">[5]</a>.<a name="r5"></a> Moreover, 
  Lamer C.J.C. specifically noted, &quot;the appellants were aware that they were 
  involved in a business which risked infringing the Criminal Code&quot; and said 
  he found it significant that &quot;those seeking OFRB approval and classification 
  for films must pay the OFRB per minute of film&quot;<a href="#6">[6]</a>.<a name="r6"></a> 
  He also said &quot;the appellants sought and paid for the OFRB opinion of these 
  particular films before putting them on their shelves&quot;<a href="#7">[7]</a>.<a name="r7"></a> 
  Accordingly, it appears clear that, in that case, the accused did turn his mind 
  to the potential legal consequences of the prohibited aspect of his conduct 
  and that there was evidence that he understood Ontario Film Review Board approval 
  meant that the videos were not obscene. There was no similar form of evidence 
  in this case.</p>
<p> [73] Finally, in determining what an accused person must consider and understand 
  in order to meet the first three requirements of the defence of officially induced 
  error, I also rely on Lamer C.J.C.'s comments that, like entrapment, this defence 
  functions as an excuse for what is otherwise culpable conduct. Where the defence 
  is made out, the appropriate remedy is to enter a judicial stay, not an acquittal, 
  thus ensuring that it will be successful in only the clearest of cases.<a href="#8">[8]</a><a name="r8"></a> 
  Accordingly, the very nature of the defence requires that its elements be strictly 
  interpreted and applied.</p>
<p>
  [74] Turning to the air of reality issue, I conclude that before raising the 
  defence of officially induced error, an accused person must first establish 
  that he made an error that constitutes an error of law. In this case, in my 
  view, no evidence was adduced capable of supporting an inference that the respondents 
  contravened the Conservation Authorities Act regulation as the result of an 
  error of law. I therefore conclude that there was no air of reality to the defence 
  of officially induced error.</p>
<p>
  [75] In Jorgensen, Lamer C.J.C. alluded to this preliminary requirement on two 
  occasions when discussing the existence and availability of the defence. </p>
<p>
  [76] First, when beginning his discussion of the elements of the defence, Lamer 
  C.J.C. emphasized the importance of maintaining the distinction between errors 
  of law and errors of fact in preserving the principle that ignorance of the 
  law is no excuse. In doing so, he said the following at paragraph 28:</p>
<p class="indent">
  The first step in raising an officially induced error of law argument will be 
  to determine that the error was in fact one of law or of mixed law and fact. 
  Of course, if the error is purely one of fact, this argument will be unnecessary 
  &#133; Distinguishing between mistakes of fact and those of law remains conceptually 
  important. Mistakes of law will only be exculpatory in narrowly defined circumstances 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [77] Later, when summing up the requirements of the defence, he said the following 
  at paragraph 36: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It can only be raised after the Crown has proven all elements of the offence. 
  In order for an accused to rely on this excuse, she must show, after establishing 
  she made an error of law, that she considered her legal position, consulted 
  an appropriate official, obtained reasonable advice and relied on that advice 
  in her actions [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [78] In this case, the respondents led no evidence at trial. Instead they brought 
  three motions at the conclusion of the prosecution's case to dismiss the charges 
  against them. The first motion related to whether the prosecution had established 
  a case against Mr. Terpstra personally. In their second motion, the respondents 
  claimed that the building permit was a complete defence to the charges under 
  the Conservation Authorities Act regulation. In their third motion, the respondents 
  claimed that the prosecution had not established that the construction site 
  was a swamp. The presiding Justice of the Peace dismissed the charges based 
  on the third motion.</p>
<p>
  [79] On appeal, the respondents submitted that, by issuing a building permit, 
  the chief building official gave an opinion, under s. 8(2) of the Building Code 
  Act, 1992, S.O. 1992 c. 23, that the proposed construction complied with &quot;any 
  other applicable law&quot;, including regulations under the Conservation Authorities 
  Act. They claimed that if the chief building official made an error in giving 
  that opinion, they were entitled to rely on the building permit as evidence 
  of officially induced error.</p>
<p>
  [80] The essence of the respondents' claim that they made an error of law is 
  that the building permit amounted to &quot;advice&quot; from the chief building 
  official that the proposed construction did not contravene &quot;other applicable 
  law&quot;. However, there was no evidence that the respondents were aware, at 
  the time they commenced construction, that the chief building official was required 
  to consider whether the proposed construction contravened &quot;other applicable 
  law&quot; before issuing a building permit. Accordingly, in my view, at the 
  close of the prosecution's case, there was no evidence capable of supporting 
  an inference that the respondents actually made an error, and, therefore, no 
  basis for classifying any error that they may have made. The respondents were 
  not therefore entitled to raise the defence of officially induced error. </p>
<p> [81] In reaching this conclusion, I have considered that, in Jorgensen, the 
  accused did not testify, but that Lamer C.J.C. nevertheless held that he might 
  have been entitled to a defence based on error of law. However, in that case, 
  as I have already noted, there was other evidence that the accused made an error 
  of law. In particular, there was evidence that the accused told police that 
  he purchased only videos that had been approved by the Ontario Film Review Board<a href="#9">[9]</a>.<a name="r9"></a> 
  In addition, Lamer C.J.C. noted, &quot;[t]he appellants were aware that they 
  were involved in a business which risked infringing the Criminal Code&quot;<a href="#10">[10]</a>.<a name="r10"></a> 
  Accordingly, there was an evidentiary basis for Lamer C.J.C.'s conclusion that 
  the accused made an error of law, namely &quot;concluding that the films [he] 
  retailed were not legally obscene [emphasis added]&quot;<a href="#11">[11]</a>.<a name="r11"></a></p>
<p>
  [82] In summary, because I have concluded that, at the close of the prosecution's 
  case, there was no evidence capable of supporting an inference that the respondents 
  made an error of law, I also conclude that there was no air of reality to the 
  defence of officially induced error, and that the respondents were not entitled 
  to raise it.</p>
<p>
  [83] I agree with my colleagues that there is no merit in the respondents' arguments 
  based on due diligence and issue estoppel.</p>
<p>[84] I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.</p>
