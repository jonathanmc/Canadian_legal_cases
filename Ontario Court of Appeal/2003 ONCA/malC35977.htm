<p>On appeal from the acquittals entered by Justice T. Cleary on January 25, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This appeal turns on whether the trial judge erred in law in holding that 
  the police did not have reasonable grounds to arrest the respondent. </p>  <P>
  [2] Seven &quot;car jackings&quot; occurred at various plazas within a small 
  section of Scarborough between January 31 and June 3, 2000. All of the victims 
  were Asian. The modus operendi and the description of the sole perpetrator strongly 
  suggested that the same person had committed all seven robberies. </p>  
<P> [3] On June 6, 2000, the police decided they had grounds to arrest the respondent 
  and charge him with various offences arising out of the seven &quot;car jackings&quot;. 
  The police had the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The respondent, who was only seventeen years old, had previously been convicted 
    of a very similar &quot;car jacking&quot; involving an Asian victim. That 
    robbery had occurred at a plaza where one of the seven &quot;car jackings&quot; 
    had occurred. </li>
  <li>Only four of the cars were recovered by the police. Three of those cars 
    were found a short distance from the residence of the respondent's girlfriend. 
    She lived in the same general area where the various plazas were located.</li>
  <li>The respondent and two companions were seen in the plaza where one of the 
    robberies occurred about an hour and a half before the robbery. The owner 
    of a small convenience store observed the respondent and described his conduct 
    at the time as &quot;suspicious&quot;.</li>
  <li>In May, a police surveillance unit observed the respondent in the plaza 
    where one of the robberies had taken place the previous February.</li>
  <li>In late May and early June, the respondent was seen in another one of the 
    plazas where one of the robberies had occurred. That robbery took place in 
    April. The respondent approached a vehicle in which a Dr. Kwong, a dentist, 
    was seated. The manner in which he approached Dr. Kwong was sufficiently suspicious 
    to cause Dr. Kwong to telephone 911. Dr. Kwong had seen the respondent approach 
    his car in a similar manner on an earlier occasion. Dr. Kwong saw the respondent 
    a third time on a subsequent occasion. This time he instructed his secretary 
    to telephone the police. </li>
  <li>The respondent's race, age and height were consistent with the very general 
    descriptions given by most of the victims of the &quot;car jackings&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<P>
  [4] The trial judge accepted that the police believed that they had reasonable 
  grounds to arrest the respondent. He held, however, that the information available 
  to the police at the time of the arrest did not satisfy the objective component 
  of the reasonable grounds requirement. </p>  <P>
  [5] The determination of whether the police had proper grounds to arrest the 
  respondent requires the application of a legal standard to a given set of facts. 
  We accept the findings of fact made by the trial judge. Indeed, most of the 
  facts were not in dispute. The trial judge's determination that those facts 
  did not, when viewed objectively, provide reasonable grounds for the arrest 
  of the respondent raises a question of law alone: R. v. Storrey (1990), 53 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 346 (S.C.C.). That decision must be reviewed on a correctness standard. 
  </p>  <P>
  [6] The cumulative effect of the circumstances known to the police raises much 
  more than a mere suspicion. While individual facts, considered in isolation, 
  may have little force, considered in their totality these facts, when objectively 
  viewed, compel the conclusion that there were reasonable grounds to believe 
  that the respondent had committed the &quot;car jackings&quot;.</p>  <P>
  [7] The trial judge's analysis which led to the opposite result reveals two 
  errors. First, he failed to give any consideration to the evidence placing the 
  respondent at the scene of one of the robberies about one and a half hours before 
  that robbery took place. Second, the trial judge subjected the identification 
  evidence given by Dr. Kwong and his secretary to a level of scrutiny which, 
  while fully justified by a trier of fact at trial, had no place in the assessment 
  of whether reasonable and probable grounds for an arrest existed. The police 
  were entitled to include the identification of the respondent provided by Dr. 
  Kwong's secretary among the facts to be considered in deciding whether reasonable 
  grounds existed for the arrest of the respondent. In doing so, they were not 
  required to caution themselves against the frailties inherent in identification 
  evidence, or to downgrade her evidence because Dr. Kwong was unable to make 
  an identification. There was ample basis upon which the police could reasonably 
  conclude that the respondent was the person who approached Dr. Kwong's car. 
  </p>  <P>
  [8] The trial judge erred in law in holding that the arrest was unlawful. There 
  were reasonable grounds for the arrest and the police believed that they had 
  those reasonable grounds. Section 494(1)(a) of the Criminal Code authorized 
  the arrest.</p>  <P>
  [9] It flows from our holding that the arrest was lawful, that the search of 
  the respondent and his vehicle incidental to that arrest was also lawful and 
  did not violate s. 8 of the Charter. It also follows that the subsequent search 
  of the respondent's residence conducted under the authority of a search warrant 
  obtained in part as a result of information gathered during the search of the 
  respondent's vehicle was not unreasonable or contrary to s. 8 of the Charter. 
  The evidence obtained during those searches could not be excluded under s. 24(2) 
  of the Charter.</p>  <P>
  [10] The appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered.</p>
