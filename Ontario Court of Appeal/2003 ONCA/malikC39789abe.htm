<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The trial judge held that the lack of clarity in the appellants' 
  offer prevented it from attracting the cost consequences of Rule 49. That holding 
  was made in the exercise of his discretion. Although another trial judge may 
  have taken a different view of the offer, we can find no error in principle 
  or other reviewable error in the exercise of the trial judge's discretion. 
  In particular, the wording of paragraph 2 and the absence of any reference to 
  the Family Law Act claimant support the costs order that he made.</p>
<p> [2] Moreover, the trial judge's holding affirms an important underlying 
  policy of Rule 49: that especially in cases where there are multiple claimants, 
  to be effective Rule 49 offers must be crystal clear. </p>
<p> [3] For these brief reasons the appeal is dismissed. The respondents are entitled 
  to their costs of the appeal, including the leave motion, on a partial indemnity 
  basis, which we fix in the amount of $7,500 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
