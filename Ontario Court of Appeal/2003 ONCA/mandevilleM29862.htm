<p>CHARRON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The defendant The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company moves before this 
  court for directions in connection with a proposed appeal from the order of 
  Nordheimer J. dated September 30, 2002 dismissing its Rule 21 motion. If necessary, 
  the defendant also seeks leave of the court to extend the time to appeal the 
  order. The defendant seeks the direction of the court on the question of whether 
  the order made on the Rule 21 motion is interlocutory or final in nature. It 
  is only in the event that this court finds that it is final that an order extending 
  the time to appeal is sought.</p>
<p>
  [2] The plaintiffs take the position that this court is without jurisdiction 
  to entertain this motion as there is no notice of appeal before the court. They 
  further submit that, in any event, there is no basis to grant an extension of 
  time to file an appeal.</p>
<p>
  [3] I see no merit to the plaintiffs' jurisdictional argument. A notice of appeal 
  cannot be filed by the defendant since it is out of time. This court clearly 
  has jurisdiction to entertain a motion for an extension of time to file a notice 
  of appeal even if this request is couched as an alternate ground of relief. 
  Rule 1.05 further provides that when making an order under the Rules, the court 
  may impose such terms and give such directions as are just. In light of the 
  particular circumstances of this case, which I will outline shortly, it is my 
  view that justice requires that I give directions as requested on the nature 
  of the Rule 21 order. </p>
<p>
  [4] In his reasons for decision, reported at [2002] O.J. No. 5386, the motions 
  judge succinctly set out the nature of this action as follows at paras. 2-3: </p>
<p class="indent"> The claims in this action arise out of the transfer in late 
  1996 by the defendant of its Barbados policies to a third party corporation. 
  This transfer was part of an ongoing effort by the defendant to sell all of 
  its Caribbean business. The plaintiffs, who propose to act on behalf of a class 
  comprised of the 8,048 Barbados policyholders of the defendant, complain that 
  this transfer was undertaken without ensuring that their interests in receiving 
  benefits if the defendant demutualized were protected or safeguarded. Slightly 
  over a year after the transaction closed, the defendant's board of directors 
  announced that the defendant would demutualize as soon as the law permitting 
  it came into force. The result was that the Barbados policyholders did not receive 
  the substantial benefits of demutualization that other policyholders of the 
  defendant received when demutualization occurred. The plaintiffs plead that 
  the failure of the defendant to protect the Barbados policyholders was negligent 
  and/or was a breach of fiduciary duties owed by the defendant to these policyholders. 
  The plaintiffs seek various declarations to that effect as well as general damages 
  and punitive damages of $150 million.</p>
<p class="indent">The defendant asserts that the rights of the proposed class 
  were extinguished by the transfer of their insurance policies in 1996, in accordance 
  with the Barbados Insurance Act. That Act required that the transfer of the 
  defendant's Barbados insurance business be sanctioned by the Barbados Supervisor 
  of Insurance through a process that included notice, the right to object, and 
  a hearing, with a right of appeal to the Barbados court. The transfer was ultimately 
  sanctioned by the Supervisor of Insurance which the defendant says thereby brought 
  to an end the relationship between the defendant and the Barbados policyholders. 
  The defendant also says that, pursuant to the Barbados Insurance Act, the transfer, 
  one sanctioned, is binding on all policyholders, i.e., it is binding on all 
  members of the proposed class.</p>
<p>
  [5] The defendant moved pursuant to rules 21.01(3)(a) and (d) of the Rules of 
  Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 and s. 106 of the Courts of Justice Act, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 to dismiss or stay the action on the basis that the Superior 
  Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims raised 
  or that the action is an abuse of the court's process. The plaintiffs moved 
  concurrently to certify the action as a class proceeding. This latter motion 
  is not in issue on the motion presently before me. After giving thorough and 
  extensive reasons, the motions judge concluded that he was unable to dispose 
  of the issues raised on the Rule 21 motion without a trial. His reasons are 
  replete with statements such as the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> I do not consider it to be my role on this type of motion to 
  resolve such a conflict on the evidence &#133; </p>
<p class="indent">I do not consider it necessary to reach a conclusion on that 
  issue. In my view, it is enough for me to conclude that there is an issue regarding 
  the proper interpretation of the statutory scheme and that, in turn, is all 
  that is necessary to conclude that the matter should not be resolved on a summary 
  basis &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike those cases, however, I do not find that it is clear, 
  or that it is plain and obvious, that the process under the Barbados Insurance 
  Act either does, or was intended to, address the causes of action which the 
  plaintiffs allege here &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Consequently, I find that it is not clear that the claims raised 
  by the plaintiffs were determined in the Barbados proceeding and therefore it 
  is not clear that this court is without jurisdiction to hear and determine those 
  matters &#133; </p>
<p class="indent">The argument on this aspect of the motion reinforces my conclusion 
  that this is not a matter which ought to be determined summarily &#133; </p>
<p class="indent">I reach no conclusions regarding these matters. As I have said, 
  I do not consider it my role on this type of a motion to reach such conclusions. 
  I do consider that these matters require a trial for their determination so 
  that the court can decide after a review of the full facts whether or not the 
  plaintiffs' claim ought to be precluded or whether the court ought to exercise 
  its discretion to relieve from that result &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">In the end result, therefore, I am unable to find that a trial 
  is unnecessary to deal with these very serious and complex issues. The motion 
  under rule 21.01(3) to dismiss or stay the action must therefore be dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [6] Following this decision and within the appeal period, counsel for the respective 
  parties (not counsel appearing on this motion) exchanged the following correspondence. 
  Counsel for the defendant, in a letter dated October 3, 2002, wrote the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is our position on a review of the decision that it is interlocutory - that 
  is, there are no final determinations of points of law. There would therefore 
  be no automatic right of appeal from any aspect of the decision. If you disagree, 
  please let us know as soon as possible given the approaching appeal periods.</p>
<p>
  [7] In response, counsel for the plaintiffs wrote the following on October 6, 
  2002: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Before I respond to your letter of October 3, 2002, please advise whether Manulife 
  intends to appeal or seek leave to appeal as the case may be.</p>
<p>
  [8] On October 7, 2002, counsel for the defendants responded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  We write further to your letter of October 6, 2002. At present, we do not plan 
  to seek leave to appeal, and there would be no right of appeal. If, however, 
  you disagree with the position set out in our letter of October 3, we will have 
  to reconsider taking into account your response.</p>
<p>
  [9] Finally, counsel for the plaintiffs, in a letter dated October 8, 2002, 
  stated the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  We write further to your letters of October 3 and 7, 2002. At present, we too 
  believe that there is no right of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [10] Not surprisingly given the context, counsel for the defendants took this 
  latter response as an acknowledgement that the order was interlocutory in nature. 
  Hence, given its belief that there had been no final determinations on those 
  defences that it wished to bring, the defendant filed its statement of defence 
  alleging, among other things, the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  8. The plaintiffs' claim should be dismissed because: </p>
<p class="indent"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) the plaintiffs' claim, brought in Canada five years after 
  the transfer of the Barbados policies by individuals who never pursued any of 
  the appropriate avenues of appeal or judicial review, is an improper attack 
  on the finality and integrity of the Barbados and Canadian regulatory systems 
  and is an abuse of process.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">83. Manulife denies the alleged liability to the Barbados policyholders. 
  The plaintiffs' claim should be dismissed because: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the principles of international comity require the Ontario 
  courts to decline to exercise jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' action;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">87. Under principles of comity, Canadian courts must defer to 
  and respect the law of Barbados and the legal actions taken by Barbados within 
  its territory. In particular, Canadian courts must recognize, defer to and respect 
  the regulatory regime established by the Barbados Insurance Act, and the effect 
  of the Sanction.</p>
<p>
  [11] The plaintiffs then responded to the pleading by a reply that contained 
  the following allegation: </p>
<p class="indent">
  12. In reply to paragraphs 8(f), 83(a) and 87 of the statement of defence, the 
  plaintiffs plead that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) by order dated September 30, 2002, the Ontario court finally determined 
  that it exercised jurisdiction over this action and that this action was not 
  an abuse of process [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [12] After receiving the plaintiffs' reply, counsel for the defendant notified 
  counsel for the plaintiffs that the pleading in subparagraph 12(a) of the reply 
  was improper as well as surprising given the earlier exchange of correspondence 
  between them. Counsel for Manulife indicated that its client would move to strike 
  out that subparagraph if the plaintiffs would not remove it. Plaintiffs' counsel 
  declined to amend the reply. By that time, the appeal period had expired. Manulife 
  therefore proceeded with a motion pursuant to rule 25.11 to strike out the impugned 
  pleading. The motion was heard, again before Nordheimer J., on March 7, 2003. 
  The motions judge dismissed the motion finding that the question of whether 
  the Rule 21 decision was final or interlocutory was not a matter that was pertinent 
  to a pleading motion under Rule 25. </p>
<p>
  [13] It is against this background that the defendant now moves before this 
  court to finally resolve the issue that has arisen between the parties.</p>
<p>
  [14] It is common ground between the parties that a decision made pursuant to 
  rule 21.01(3) may be final or interlocutory in nature. See, for example, Abbott 
  v. Collins (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 99 (C.A.), where the order was found to be final, 
  and Suresh v. Canada (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 793 (C.A.), where the order was found 
  to be interlocutory. The question whether an order is final depends on whether 
  the decision results in a final adjudication of a substantive right between 
  the parties. In this case, the motions judge declined to decide the issues that 
  were raised in the Rule 21 motion because he thought it was inappropriate to 
  do so given the conflicting state of the evidence and the complexity of the 
  issues. Hence, the order is clearly interlocutory in nature and no appeal lies 
  to this court.</p>
<p>
  [15] Counsel for the plaintiffs agrees that the order is interlocutory in nature 
  and, indeed, submits that if the defendant had launched an appeal before this 
  court, his clients would have moved to quash that appeal for lack of jurisdiction. 
  Nonetheless, counsel for the plaintiffs maintains that the motions judge's decision 
  on the Rule 21 motion has the effect of foreclosing all issues related to jurisdiction 
  and to the question of abuse of process at trial. In particular, counsel relies 
  on the following comments contained in the motions judge's reasons for decision, 
  at paras. 47 and 51, that he contends are final in nature: </p>
<p class="indent"> &#133; I reject the alternative contention of the defendant 
  that in some fashion the courts of Barbados are the only courts to which the 
  plaintiffs may have recourse in the instance where it is determined that the 
  issues are still live for adjudication &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">I do not view this case as involving a collateral attack on 
  the decision of the Supervisor. To the contrary, on this branch of the argument 
  it seems to me that the plaintiffs' attack on the Sanction is not collateral, 
  it is direct.</p>
<p>
  [16] In my view, those statements, made in the course of lengthy reasons for 
  decision, do not at all detract from the interlocutory nature of the order that 
  was made. The motions judge's reasons should not be taken as anything more than 
  his explanation for finding that the issues raised on the Rule 21 motion should 
  go to trial.</p>
<p>
  [17] Consequently, I dismiss the defendant's motion for an extension of time 
  within which to appeal on the ground that this court has no jurisdiction to 
  entertain an appeal from an interlocutory order. However, given the rather disingenuous 
  position advanced by counsel for the plaintiffs on this issue, I make no order 
  as to costs.</p>
