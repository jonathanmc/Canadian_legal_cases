<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Mr. Burstein, who appears as duty counsel, has very ably advanced two grounds 
  of appeal on behalf of the appellant. We cannot give effect to either argument.</p>
<p>
  [2] The trial judge did not endorse Crown counsel's opinion as to the reliability 
  of the witness, Borello, but instead put the Crown's position with respect to 
  her reliability, just as he had put the defence position with respect to her 
  reliability in the immediately preceding paragraph. </p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge's instructions on the use which the jury could make of the 
  appellant's statement, and in particular the exculpatory parts of that statement, 
  were correct in law and, in our view, would not have confused the jury. </p>
<p>
  [4] Mr. Mansour vigorously advanced several grounds of appeal on his own behalf. 
  We also cannot give effect to those arguments.</p>
<p>
  [5] The Crown did not call Ms. Borello on this trial. It had called her on the 
  first trial and at the preliminary inquiry. Crown counsel is entitled to determine 
  what witnesses will be called in any particular trial on behalf of the Crown. 
  That decision may be reviewed by a court only on very narrow grounds. None of 
  those grounds exists in this case. Ms. Borello was called by the defence, the 
  Crown was free to cross-examine Ms. Borello and the limits set out in s. 9 of 
  the Canada Evidence Act had no application. </p>
<p>
  [6] The admissibility of the appellant's out-of-court statement to the police 
  officer shortly after the accident was not challenged at trial. It was in part 
  exculpatory and to that extent became a central feature of the defence at trial. 
  The appellant did not testify. As there was no objection taken to the admissibility 
  of the statement, indeed it was tendered on consent, we are satisfied that we 
  should not reconsider its admissibility at this time. Nor is there any basis 
  upon which we can &quot;second guess&quot; counsel's decision to agree to the 
  admissibility of the statement. </p>
<p>
  [7] There is no merit to the issue estoppel argument or the related Charter 
  arguments. The appellant was acquitted of criminal negligence at his first trial 
  but no verdict was reached on the dangerous driving causing death charge. The 
  Crown was entitled to retry that charge absent any basis upon which it could 
  be held that such a retrial would constitute an abuse. There is no basis for 
  that finding in this case. </p>
<p>
  [8] The verdict was not unreasonable. The Crown's position was supported by 
  some expert evidence and by the evidence of a witness (Ms. Rest). We cannot 
  say that no jury, properly instructed, could have come to this conclusion. </p>
<p>
  [9] The instruction by the trial judge on the issue of causation both initially 
  and in the recharge complied with recent pronouncements of the Supreme Court 
  of Canada: R. v. Nette (2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 486 (S.C.C.). A trial judge has 
  a discretion as to how to instruct the jury so as to conform with the dictates 
  of the recent jurisprudence. We see no basis upon which to say that the words 
  chosen by the trial judge did not properly convey the meaning of legal causation. 
  </p>
<p>
  [10] With respect to sentence, we see no error in principle in the sentence 
  imposed and would not interfere with that sentence. </p>
<p>
  [11] The appeal from conviction is dismissed and the appeal from sentence is 
  dismissed. A warrant may issue for the arrest of the appellant, if necessary.</p>
