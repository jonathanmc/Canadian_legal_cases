<p>On appeal from the order of Justice N. Douglas Coo of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated February 27, 2002.</p>
<p>
  CATZMAN J.A.:</p>
<p>
  The appeal and the motion for leave to appeal</p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal by S. Paul Mantini (&quot;the lawyer&quot;) from an order 
  striking out his statement of claim and dismissing his action for defamation 
  against Smith Lyons LLP (&quot;the law firm&quot;) and John R. Finley (&quot;the 
  managing partner&quot;). The lawyer also moves for leave to appeal the order 
  that he pay the costs of the action on a partial indemnity scale.</p>
<p>
  [2] These reasons are being released contemporaneously with the reasons of this 
  court on the appeal by the law firm and the managing partner from an order refusing 
  to stay or dismiss a related action brought by the lawyer and to refer to arbitration 
  claims made in that action. </p>
<p>
  The background and the alleged libel</p>
<p> [3] In December 2000, the lawyer and four other lawyers left the law firm 
  to take up positions elsewhere. Following their departure, the managing partner 
  gave an interview<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> to the Law Times, a publication described 
  in the statement of claim as &quot;a weekly newspaper which is widely circulated 
  in the legal community in Toronto and elsewhere in Canada&quot;. In its January 
  29, 2001 edition, the Law Times published an article entitled &quot;Five lawyers 
  gone in Smith Lyons' restructuring&quot;. The article mentioned, by name, the 
  lawyer (whom it described as &quot;one of Canada's leading corporate commercial 
  lawyers&quot;) and the four others who had left the firm.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  Remarks quoting or attributed to the managing partner appeared in nine of the 
  article's paragraphs, but only two are the subject of complaint. The two paragraphs 
  read:</p>
<p class="indent"> Finley attributes the miniature exodus to a &quot;period of 
  strategic planning and restructuring&quot; at the firm.</p>
<p class="indent">&quot;Our restructuring has resulted in a greater focus on teamwork 
  in both marketing and the provision of client services,&quot; he says. &quot;When 
  a partnership restructures to this degree, there is always the possibility that 
  some individuals may choose to relocate rather than adjust to the requirements 
  of the new structure.&quot;</p>
<p>
  The full article is reproduced at the end of these reasons.</p>
<p>
  [4] The lawyer instituted an action for defamation against the law firm and 
  the managing partner, claiming that the managing partner's comments, set out 
  above, were libellous. The statement of claim alleged that the words were meant, 
  and were understood to mean, that the lawyer:</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) was forced out of the law firm;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) was unable or unwilling to work as part of a team at the 
  law firm;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) practises law selfishly, rather than as a co-operative member 
  of a team; </p>
<p class="indent">(d) conducted himself in an unprofessional manner.</p>
<p>
  The motion before Coo J.</p>
<p>
  [5] The law firm and the managing partner moved under rule 21.01 to strike out 
  the statement of claim and dismiss the lawyer's action on the basis that the 
  words in question were not reasonably capable of bearing the meanings alleged. 
  The well-known test on such a motion is whether it is plain and obvious that 
  no reasonable cause of action is disclosed: Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 
  2 S.C.R. 959 at 980.</p>
<p>
  [6] Coo J. granted the motion. In an endorsement setting forth his reasons, 
  he held that the language could not support any of the meanings relied on by 
  the lawyer in his statement of claim, and dismissed the lawyer's action with 
  costs on a partial indemnity scale. </p>
<p>
  [7] At the request of counsel for the lawyer, Coo J. entertained further written 
  submissions regarding costs. The lawyer's position was that no costs should 
  be awarded because the law firm and the managing partner had failed, contrary 
  to the provisions of rule 21.02, to make its motion promptly and that substantial 
  costs had been incurred in a number of procedural steps taken in the action 
  between its institution and the motion. Coo J. issued a second endorsement, 
  in which he said that he had reviewed his disposition of costs in light of the 
  written submissions and that he saw no reason to depart from his original conclusion.</p>
<p>
  The claim for defamation </p>
<p>
  [8] In support of his appeal against the order dismissing his action, the lawyer 
  submitted that, having regard to the stringent test under rule 21.01, Coo. J. 
  erred in concluding that it was plain and obvious that the words complained 
  of in the statement of claim were not capable of bearing any of the four defamatory 
  meanings alleged. </p>
<p>
  [9] Before Coo. J and in this court, the law firm and the managing partner placed 
  much emphasis on the fact that the alleged defamatory words do not make any 
  specific reference to the lawyer or, indeed, to any one of the five lawyers 
  named in the article. While Coo J. found &quot;some considerable strength in 
  this position&quot;, he was not prepared to rule against the lawyer's action 
  on that basis. I propose to do as he did, and I therefore turn to the question 
  of the alleged defamatory meanings. </p>
<p>
  [10] The test to determine whether allegedly libellous words are capable of 
  a defamatory meaning has been reviewed in a number of authorities, including 
  the recent decision of Lane J. in Hodgson v. Canadian Newspapers Co. (1998), 
  39 O.R. (3d) 235, affd (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.). Under the heading &quot;Legal 
  principles with respect to meaning&quot;, Lane J. said, at 252-253:</p>
<p class="indent"> It is a question of law whether any imputation contained in 
  the words complained of is capable of being defamatory. </p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">In deciding whether the words are capable of a defamatory meaning 
  the trial judge will construe the words according to the meaning they would 
  be given by reasonable persons of ordinary intelligence, and will not consider 
  what persons setting themselves to work to deduce some unusual meaning might 
  succeed in extracting from them.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">To determine the natural and ordinary meaning of the words it 
  is necessary to take into account the context in which the words were used and 
  the mode of publication. </p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">The natural and ordinary meaning of the words is to be determined 
  according to the fair and natural meaning in which reasonable persons with the 
  ordinary person's general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs, would 
  be likely to understand them in the context in which they were used.</p>
<p class="indent">The test to be applied by the court is whether the words complained 
  of, in their natural and ordinary meaning, determined in accordance with the 
  principles stated above, may tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of 
  reasonable persons or to expose the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or ridicule 
  &#133; [authorities and citations omitted].</p>
<p> [11] The preliminary determination whether the impugned words are capable 
  of bearing the defamatory meanings pleaded is a question of law and has been 
  referred to as the &quot;gatekeeper function&quot;: Laufer v. Bucklaschuk (1999), 
  181 D.L.R. (4th) 83 (Man. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (2000), 189 
  D.L.R. (4th) vii. That function was described in the following terms in Laufer, 
  at para. 25<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a>:</p>
<p class="indent"> In a defamation trial, the trial judge is required to engage 
  in a two-stage process. He must first determine as a question of law whether 
  the challenged words are capable of bearing the meaning or meanings set forth 
  in the pleadings. He must also determine whether the alleged defamatory meaning 
  or meanings relate to the plaintiff. The threshold question in every defamation 
  action is whether the words cited are reasonably capable of a defamatory meaning 
  in relation to the plaintiff. If the trial judge has any doubt as to whether 
  the words are capable of bearing the meanings relied upon by the plaintiff, 
  he must withdraw the case from the jury. Only if he is satisfied that the published 
  statements are capable of bearing the meanings alleged by the plaintiff in his 
  pleadings, and are capable of relating to the plaintiff, may the trial judge 
  then proceed to the second stage of the process. He may then instruct the jury 
  on their function as finders of fact [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [12] As indicated below, I find it plain and obvious, as did Coo J., that the 
  words in the two paragraphs on which the lawyer's defamation action is based 
  are not capable of bearing the defamatory meanings that he alleges in his statement 
  of claim. </p>
<p>
  (a) &quot;was forced out of Smith Lyons&quot;</p>
<p>
  [13] The impugned words are not capable of the meaning that the lawyer was forced 
  out of the law firm. Indeed, they suggest the opposite. The managing partner 
  is quoted as saying that &quot;there is always the possibility that some individuals 
  may choose to relocate&quot;. Choosing to relocate is very different from being 
  forced out. </p>
<p>
  (b) &quot;was unable or unwilling to work as part of a team&quot;</p>
<p> [14] Having regard to the context of the article<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a> and the 
  character of the newspaper's readership<a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="r5"></a>, the impugned words 
  are not capable of the meaning that the lawyer was unable to work as part of 
  a team or that he was unwilling to do so. The theme of the article is not the 
  intransigence of the lawyers who left but rather the pressures facing mid-sized 
  law firms in an era of expansion, merger and specialization. The impugned words 
  are to be construed according to the meaning they would be given by reasonable 
  persons of ordinary intelligence, not what persons setting themselves to work 
  to deduce some unusual meaning might succeed in extracting from them: Hodgson 
  v. Canadian Newspapers Co. (1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 235 at 252-253. The suggested 
  meaning falls into the latter category.</p>
<p>
  (c) &quot;practises law selfishly and not as a co-operative member of a team&quot;</p>
<p>
  [15] Having regard to the context of the article and the character of the newspaper's 
  readership, the impugned words are not capable of the meaning that the lawyer 
  practises law selfishly. Nothing in the article can be taken to suggest or imply 
  that selfishness is an aspect of the lawyer's practice. The balance of the suggested 
  meaning - that the lawyer does not practise &quot;as a co-operative member of 
  a team&quot; - is a reworded version of suggested meaning (b), above, and the 
  same observations as to that meaning apply.</p>
<p>
  (d) &quot;conducted himself in a unprofessional manner&quot;</p>
<p>
  [16] The impugned words are not capable of the meaning that the lawyer conducted 
  himself in an unprofessional manner. The whole tenor of the article is the pressures 
  on full-service law firms in the modern economy. However one may characterize 
  the lawyer's response to his law firm's restructuring to meet these pressures, 
  the one characterization that cannot apply is lack of professionalism. I return 
  to the quotation of the managing partner in the impugned words: &quot;there 
  is always the possibility that some individuals may choose to relocate rather 
  than adjust to the requirements of the new structure&quot;. Choosing to relocate 
  is not, and cannot be strained to mean, unprofessionalism. </p>
<p>
  [17] Thus, in my view, the impugned words are clearly incapable of any of the 
  four meanings pleaded in the lawyer's statement of claim. Of all of them, only 
  with suggested meaning (b) (and its duplicate, in the latter portion of suggested 
  meaning (c)) is it even arguable that the plain and obvious test might not be 
  met. In any event, although I disagree with that proposition, I am of the view 
  that saying that one of Canada's leading corporate commercial lawyers was unable 
  or unwilling to work as part of a team, or did not practise as a co-operative 
  member of a team, could not possibly be seen as defamatory. As it happened, 
  the article indicated that the lawyer had left the law firm to join another 
  well-known law firm of equivalent size. But even if he had chosen to practise 
  alone, the legal profession has long respected practitioners who make that choice 
  and the suggested meanings, made to &quot;the legal community in Toronto and 
  elsewhere in Canada&quot;, do not defame.</p>
<p>
  [18] I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  The order for costs</p>
<p>
  [19] The lawyer's motion for leave to appeal Coo J.'s disposition of costs is 
  based on delay by the law firm and the managing partner in bringing their motion 
  under rule 21.01. Rule 21.02 requires that such a motion shall be made promptly 
  and that a failure to do so may be taken into account by the court in awarding 
  costs. In the lawyer's submission, the law firm and the managing partner not 
  only failed to move promptly, but they took a series of steps in the action 
  over a six-month period that ran up unnecessary legal costs for them and imposed 
  unnecessary costs on the lawyer. </p>
<p>
  [20] There is a short and complete answer to this submission. After the release 
  of the endorsement dismissing the defamation action, the lawyer requested and 
  was granted leave to make written submissions to persuade Coo J. to vary his 
  costs award. All of the arguments that were advanced in this court were addressed 
  in the lawyer's written submissions to Coo J., who considered them, reviewed 
  his disposition of costs and specifically confirmed it. I see no basis on which 
  this court could properly interfere with the exercise by Coo J. of the discretion 
  that rule 21.02 confers upon him. </p>
<p>
  [21] I would therefore dismiss the motion for leave to appeal the costs order.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [22] For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and the motion for 
  leave to appeal, both with costs on a partial indemnity scale. Having regard 
  to submissions made at the conclusion of the argument, I would fix those costs 
  in the sum of $8,500 plus disbursements and G.S.T. </p>

<hr style="height: 1px; color: #000000">
<P><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> So, too, did the lawyer. The Law Times 
  article contains more references to remarks quoting or attributed to the lawyer 
  than it does to remarks quoting or attributed to the managing partner. </p>
<P><a name="2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a> It also indicated where they had gone 
  or were going: the lawyer, to Bennett Jones; two of the others, to other firms; 
  the fourth, to a position with a large insurance company; and the fifth, to 
  a university law faculty.</p>
<P><a name="3"></a><a href="#r3">[3] </a>Laufer v. Bucklaschuk contains, at paras. 
  25-35, a useful discussion of the &#147;gatekeeper function&#148;.</p>
<P><a name="4"></a><a href="#r4">[4]</a> Generally speaking the court will consider the publication 
  as a whole, and not dwell or concentrate on isolated passages, in determining 
  whether it is defamatory: Brown, Law of Defamation in Canada, 2nd ed. (Scarborough, 
  Ont.: Carswell, 1994) (looseleaf), vol. 1, para. 5.3(6)(a) at 5-55.</p>
<P><a name="5"></a><a href="#r5">[5]</a> Consideration should be given to the 
  class of persons to whom the defamatory remarks were addressed: Brown, op. cit., 
  para. 5.3(2) at 5-34, fn. 147. Although no Canadian cases are cited in support 
  of this proposition, I share the author&#146;s view of its correctness.</p>
