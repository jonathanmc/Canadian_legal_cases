<p>On appeal from order of Justice Douglas Coo of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated February 27, 2002</p>
<p>
  FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] The respondent resigned as a partner from the appellant law firm, and commenced 
  an action asserting certain financial claims arising from his withdrawal from 
  the partnership, a claim regarding problems with the transfer of client files 
  to his new firm and a dispute regarding the validity of the non-competition 
  clause in the Partnership Agreement (the &quot;business claims&quot;). He also 
  brought a defamation action based on a letter and a newspaper interview following 
  his departure from the firm. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant moved for (1) an order dismissing the defamation action; and 
  (2) an order staying the business claims on the basis that they are the subject 
  of mandatory arbitration under the terms of the firm Partnership Agreement. 
  The motion judge granted the relief dismissing the defamation action, but declined 
  to order arbitration of the business claims, or to stay the action. Both aspects 
  of the order below were appealed to this court. In response to the portion of 
  the order refusing to stay the business claims and send them to arbitration, 
  the respondent moved to quash the appeal on the basis of s. 7(6) of the Arbitration 
  Act, 1991, S.O. 1991, c. 17. </p>
<p>
  [3] The appeal of the dismissal of the defamation claim is the subject of separate 
  reasons for judgment released together with these reasons. With respect to the 
  business claims, I would dismiss the motion to quash and allow the appeal. The 
  following are my reasons.</p>
<p>FACTS</p>
<p>[4] In his Statement of Claim, the respondent makes three general claims. First, 
  he alleges that on his withdrawal from the appellant firm, the appellant either 
  refused to transfer certain client files to the respondent's new firm or imposed 
  conditions on transfer of the files. The respondent states that these actions 
  amounted to a breach of the appellant firm's legal and professional obligations, 
  carried out by the appellant for the purpose of causing inconvenience, embarrassment 
  and damage to the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [5] Second, the respondent claims that the appellant failed to comply in some 
  cases with the Smith Lyons Partnership Agreement, or in other cases with the 
  firm's practice in respect of withdrawing partners or with assurances made to 
  the respondent, as well as with its fiduciary duty in respect of (a) repayment 
  of the respondent's capital in the amount of $350,000; (b) allocation of profits 
  for the year 2000; (c) payment of the respondent's WIP (work in progress) account; 
  and (d) payment of the respondent's goodwill account. The respondent also seeks 
  to have the non-competition portion of the Partnership Agreement declared void 
  and unenforceable.</p>
<p>
  [6] There is provision in the Partnership Agreement for withdrawal from the 
  partnership in Article 5 and Schedule E of the Agreement. Article 5.06 provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  5.06 Payments on Withdrawal: The amount and timing of all payments to a Withdrawing 
  Partner on withdrawal from the Firm shall be as determined pursuant to Schedule 
  E.</p>
<p>Schedule E details the payments to be made to withdrawing partners and includes 
  a non-competition clause.</p>
<p>
  [7] The respondent makes a third claim that the appellant firm breached its 
  agreement not to require repayment of a loan it made to the respondent of $457,638. 
  The loan is alleged to have been made to assist the respondent to meet obligations 
  incurred by him as a result of the negligence of the appellant firm.</p>
<p>
  [8] The Smith Lyons Partnership Agreement contains an arbitration clause which 
  provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  9.01 Arbitration: Except for any matters expressly within the sole discretion 
  or power of the Executive Committee or Compensation Committee, any dispute in 
  connection with this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance 
  with the provisions set out in Schedule G [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [9] Section 1 of Schedule G must also be set out. It provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1. If during the continuance of the Firm or at any time after the dissolution 
  or termination thereof, any dispute or difference, other than as within the 
  complete discretion of the Executive Committee or Compensation Committee, shall 
  arise between the Partners or any of them or their heirs or legal representatives, 
  in any way concerning: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the Firm or the practice, accounts or transactions thereof;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the dissolution or winding-up thereof;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the proper interpretation, construction, intent, meaning 
  or effect of anything in the Partnership Agreement; or</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the rights or liabilities of the Partners or their representatives;</p>
<p class="indent">which the Executive Committee cannot resolve at first instance, 
  such dispute or difference shall be referred to arbitration pursuant to the 
  following provisions and such reference shall be a condition precedent to the 
  right of any Partner, or the Partner's heirs or legal representatives, or of 
  the Firm, to take legal action in or about the premises. </p>
<p>[10] The powers of the Executive Committee are set out in Article 2.01 of the 
  Partnership Agreement: </p>
<p class="indent">
  2.01 Powers: The administration and conduct of the Firm's business and affairs 
  shall be vested exclusively in a committee of Partners (the &quot;Executive 
  Committee&quot;) to which, subject to the express provisions of this Agreement, 
  is delegated by all of the partners all power and authority to so administer 
  and conduct such business and affairs.</p>
<p> [11] Article 3.10 provides that the Compensation Committee is to allocate 
  the profits among the Partners. Article 3.10(d) states that &quot;the decisions 
  of the Compensation Committee shall not be subject to appeal or arbitration.&quot;<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [12] The motion judge found that none of the issues raised by the respondent 
  were arbitrable under the terms of the Partnership Agreement. In respect of 
  the first claim for failing to transfer files, the motion judge found that arbitration 
  could not govern and that the sole discretion of the Executive Committee could 
  not &quot;stand in the way&quot; of the plaintiff's action. Regarding the claims 
  for capital, profits, WIP and goodwill, the motion judge found that those claims 
  may be completely unsustainable because they were matters within the sole discretion 
  of the committees, but clearly they were not arbitrable. As to the loan matter, 
  the motion judge concluded that it was also a matter within the sole discretion 
  of the Executive Committee and therefore non-arbitrable.</p>
<p>
  [13] The motion judge also addressed the issue of a partial stay on the alternative 
  basis that one of the claims may be arbitrable, and determined that in that 
  event, he would not exercise his discretion to order a partial stay under s. 
  7(5) of the Arbitration Act. He concluded that because of the interrelated nature 
  of the claims, they should all be tried in the same forum at the same time.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Does s. 7(6) of the Arbitration Act bar this appeal?</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If not, did the motion judge err by failing to order a stay 
  of the respondent's claims and by failing to order that the claims be referred 
  to arbitration?</p>
<p class="indent">(3) If only some of the claims are subject to arbitration, did 
  the motion judge err in failing to stay those claims and refer them to arbitration?</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) Does s. 7(6) of the Arbitration Act bar this appeal?</p>
<p>
  [14] This issue is raised by the respondent by motion to quash the appeal, which 
  was argued with the appeal. Section 7 of the Act is key to both the motion and 
  to the appeal. It provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  7. (1) If a party to an arbitration agreement commences a proceeding in respect 
  of a matter to be submitted to arbitration under the agreement, the court in 
  which the proceeding is commenced shall, on the motion of another party to the 
  arbitration agreement, stay the proceeding.</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) However, the court may refuse to stay the proceeding in 
  any of the following cases: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. A party entered into the arbitration agreement while under 
  a legal incapacity.</p>
<p class="indent">2. The arbitration agreement is invalid.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of being 
  the subject of arbitration under Ontario law.</p>
<p class="indent">4. The motion was brought with undue delay.</p>
<p class="indent">5. The matter is a proper one for default or summary judgment.</p>
<p class="indent"> (3) An arbitration of the dispute may be commenced and continued 
  while the motion is before the court.</p>
<p class="indent"> (4) If the court refuses to stay the proceeding,</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) no arbitration of the dispute shall be commenced; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) an arbitration that has been commenced shall not be continued, 
  and anything done in connection with the arbitration before the court made its 
  decision is without effect.</p>
<p class="indent"> (5) The court may stay the proceeding with respect to the matters 
  dealt with in the arbitration agreement and allow it to continue with respect 
  to other matters if it finds that,</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the agreement deals with only some of the matters in respect 
  of which the proceeding was commenced; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) it is reasonable to separate the matters dealt with in 
  the agreement from the other matters.</p>
<p class="indent">(6) There is no appeal from the court's decision.</p>
<p>
  [15] The scope and effect of s. 7(6) of the Act have been considered by this 
  court in two recent decisions, Huras v. Primerica (2000), 137 O.A.C. 79 and 
  Brown v. Murphy, (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 404. Those cases explain that where a 
  motion judge decides that a matter is not subject to arbitration, that is a 
  decision that falls outside the scope of s. 7, and an appeal from that decision 
  is not barred by s.7(6). </p>
<p>
  [16] Therefore, because the motion judge determined that all of the respondents' 
  claims fall outside the arbitration agreement, s. 7(6) does not bar the appellant's 
  appeal. The motion judge also referred to s. 7(5) in the alternative, to refuse 
  a stay even if one of the claims is arbitrable, on the basis that all of the 
  claims should be dealt with in a single proceeding. Because of my conclusion 
  on the main issue, there will be no need to consider the application of s. 7(6) 
  to that part of the decision.</p>
<p>
  (2) Did the motion judge err by not referring the respondent's claims to mandatory 
  arbitration in accordance with the Partnership Agreement?</p>
<p>
  [17] In order to determine whether a claim should be stayed under s. 7(1) of 
  the Arbitration Act, the court first interprets the arbitration provision, then 
  analyzes the claims to determine whether they must be decided by an arbitrator 
  under the terms of the agreement, as interpreted by the court. If so, then under 
  s. 7(1), the court is required to stay the action and refer the claims to arbitration 
  subject to the limited exceptions in s. 7(2): T1T2 Limited Partnership v. The 
  Queen (1994), 23 O.R. (3d) 66 (Gen. Div.) at 73 74. </p>
<p>
  [18] I have set out above both the arbitration clause as well as other relevant 
  sections of the Partnership Agreement. The arbitration clause (Article 9.01) 
  requires that &quot;any dispute in connection with this agreement&quot; [emphasis 
  added] must be arbitrated. The only exception is matters which are expressly 
  within the sole discretion of the Executive or Compensation Committees. </p>
<p>
  [19] In the case of Denison Mines Ltd. v. Ontario Hydro, [1981] O.J. No. 807 
  (Div. Ct.) the court interpreted the words &quot;arising in connection with&quot; 
  as having &quot;a very broad meaning&quot;. The court referred to the House 
  of Lords decision in Heyman v. Darwins, [1942] A.C. 356 where Lord Porter stated 
  at p. 356 that the &quot;words 'arising out of' have a wider meaning than 'under'&quot;. 
  The Divisional Court went on to hold that &quot;the words 'arising in connection 
  with' are at least as wide as the words 'arising out of' and have a very broad 
  meaning&quot;(para. 15). I agree with these interpretations and in particular 
  with the conclusion that the phrase &quot;in connection with&quot; has a very 
  broad meaning. In my view, it has a broader scope than the phrase &quot;out 
  of&quot;, as the dispute need only be connected with the Partnership Agreement, 
  even if it does not arise from or out of a specific provision of the agreement. 
  I conclude that this clause represents a general or universal resort to arbitration, 
  but for the exception for any matters expressly within the sole discretion or 
  power of the Executive and Compensation Committees.</p>
<p>
  [20] By Article 2.01, the Executive Committee is vested exclusively with all 
  power and authority to administer and conduct the firm's business and affairs. 
  In Article 3.09 the Compensation Committee is given the authority to divide 
  the profits of the firm. By Article 3.10(d), the decisions of the Compensation 
  Committee are not subject either to appeal or to arbitration. There are other 
  Articles and Schedules to the Partnership Agreement which make specific provision 
  for aspects of firm governance, such as voting rights, withdrawal and retirement 
  from the firm (see Article 5 and Schedule E above), admission of new partners 
  and dissolution.</p>
<p>
  [21] In order to interpret the arbitration clause, it must be read in the context 
  of the agreement as a whole, and its intended meaning gleaned within that context. 
  Schedule G, is incorporated into Article 9 and informs the interpretation of 
  the intended scope and application of the arbitration provision. Section 1 of 
  Schedule G first clarifies that it is disputes between partners or their legal 
  representatives that are subject to arbitration, then describes in four categories 
  the types of disputes or differences that are subject to arbitration. They concern: 
  (1) the firm or the practice, accounts or transactions thereof; (2) the dissolution 
  or wind-up of the firm; (3) the proper interpretation, construction, intent, 
  meaning or the effect of anything in the Partnership Agreement; and (4) the 
  rights or liabilities of the Partners or their representatives. This description 
  of the types of dispute that must go to arbitration under the agreement does 
  not derogate from the general nature of the arbitration clause, but reinforces 
  its all-encompassing nature in respect of firm issues. </p>
<p>
  [22] Schedule G also restates which disputes or differences are within the exception 
  to arbitration as: &quot;other than as within the complete discretion of the 
  Executive Committee or Compensation Committee&quot; [emphasis added]. Any such 
  disputes would have gone to arbitration but because they are within the sole 
  or complete discretion of the Executive or Compensation committees, they do 
  not. </p>
<p>
  [23] In the court below, the motion judge took the view that because this group 
  of disputes was non-arbitrable, the court does not stay the claims and they 
  continue as disputes to be determined by the court. In my view, the motion judge 
  erred in that conclusion. Rather, any matters that the agreement provides as 
  expressly within the sole discretion of one of the committees is therefore non-appealable 
  and non-justiciable. They are matters that the partners have agreed will be 
  decided by the respective committees within their sole prerogative, and those 
  decisions will be accepted by the partners as final. The court must therefore 
  stay any action which seeks to appeal or challenge a dispute regarding any such 
  matters.</p>
<p>
  [24] In summary, the scheme of the Partnership Agreement is that all disputes 
  in connection with that agreement, which include all firm business and affairs 
  (Article 2.01), are to be decided by arbitration, except those that arise from 
  a matter expressly within the sole discretion of the Executive or Compensation 
  Committees, from which decisions there is no recourse. That scheme therefore 
  excludes court as a vehicle for dispute resolution in respect of all firm business 
  or affairs. </p>
<p>
  [25] This conclusion can be tested using the division of profits as an example. 
  The Partnership Agreement provides that the Compensation Committee decides the 
  division of profits each year and that there is no appeal or arbitration of 
  that decision. In other words, the partners have entrusted that decision to 
  the Compensation Committee and are prepared to abide by it. Otherwise, if a 
  dispute arises as to whether the division of profits is fair or acceptable, 
  because appeal and arbitration have been specifically excluded, a partner could 
  bring an action in court to determine the division of profits among the partners 
  each year. </p>
<p>
  [26] Because arbitration is the method of dispute resolution provided in the 
  agreement, by excluding arbitration, the partners have excluded the possibility 
  of any recourse should they be unhappy with the decision of the Compensation 
  Committee. There is no basis to conclude that the intent of the agreement is 
  that a court is to decide the issue rather than an arbitrator. That conclusion 
  would not accord with common sense, with business practice or with any provision 
  of the agreement. I agree with the statement made by the appellant in its factum 
  that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; by agreeing to such a broadly-worded arbitration provision, the parties 
  expressed a clear intention to have the disputes between them arbitrated in 
  a private setting as opposed to being litigated in a public forum. Indeed, there 
  are very logical reasons for wishing the internal affairs of a law firm such 
  as Smith Lyons to be kept private and confidential, and so it is unremarkable 
  that the parties would have agreed to such an all-encompassing arbitration provision.</p>
<p>
  [27] The question of whether any other matter that may be referred to arbitration 
  is excluded from arbitration because it is expressly within the sole discretion 
  of the Executive Committee is a jurisdictional question for the arbitrator to 
  decide: See: T1T2 Limited Partnership v. Canada; Ontario v. Abilities Frontier 
  Co-Operative Homes Inc. (1996), 5 C.P.C. (4th) 81 (Gen. Div.) at 92-3; s. 17 
  of the Arbitration Act. However, in order to give the arbitration provisions 
  any meaning, and to give commercial sense to the agreement, the scope of the 
  non-justiciable matters must be a very narrow one. In its factum, the appellant 
  firm identifies only the Compensation Committee profit allocation decision as 
  an expressly discretionary and non-justiciable decision coming within the exception. 
  There would be little point in articulating in Schedule G four categories of 
  disputes arising out of the agreement that would go to arbitration for resolution, 
  if all of such matters were excluded as within the sole discretion of the Executive 
  Committee.</p>
<p>
  [28] The only allusion to recourse to the court is in the closing words of s. 
  1 of Schedule G, which suggests that a partner or the firm may be able to take 
  legal action if the dispute has first been referred to arbitration in accordance 
  with the procedural provisions of the Schedule. In my view, this reference does 
  not derogate from the structure of the agreement that all disputes go to arbitration 
  (at least initially), except those for which there is no appeal or recourse 
  to dispute resolution.</p>
<p>
  APPLYING THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE TO THE CLAIMS IN THE ACTION</p>
<p>
  [29] With the scheme of the agreement in mind, one then turns to the specific 
  claims in the action. In order to determine whether a claim that has been brought 
  in a court action must be stayed under s. 7(1) of the Act, the court must assess 
  whether the claim comes within the arbitration clause of the agreement, that 
  is, whether the claim is one &quot;in connection with&quot; the Partnership 
  Agreement. If it is, then the action must be stayed. Conversely, if it is not 
  a claim &quot;in connection with the Partnership Agreement&quot;, then it is 
  outside the scope of the arbitration clause, it will not be stayed and can continue 
  as a court action. The third possibility is that it is a claim in connection 
  with the partnership agreement but non-arbitrable because it is expressly within 
  the sole discretion of one of the committees. In that case, the action will 
  also be stayed because any matter that is in connection with the agreement will 
  either be arbitrable or non-justiciable. In no event is it to proceed in court.</p>
<p>
  [30] Turning to the claims of the respondent, the first is the claim arising 
  from the appellant firm's failure to promptly send client files to the respondent's 
  new firm following his withdrawal from the partnership. Although this claim 
  is couched as a breach of the firm's legal and professional obligations, the 
  act of not transferring the files is an act of the firm dealing with the files 
  of firm clients and with a partner who had withdrawn from the firm. As such, 
  it is part of the administration and conduct of firm business and affairs and 
  is therefore clearly a matter in connection with the Partnership Agreement and 
  must be referred to arbitration.</p>
<p>
  [31] If either side were to take the position before the arbitrator that this, 
  or any other matter is one that is within the sole discretion of the Executive 
  Committee, that would be a jurisdictional issue for the arbitrator to decide. 
  However, although it may be arguable, depending on the firm practice and evidence 
  before the arbitrator, that some day to day administrative matters are within 
  the sole discretion of the Executive Committee and are non-justiciable, the 
  scope of matters in that category will be very narrow, in order to give effect 
  to the arbitration clause in the context of the full partnership agreement. 
  </p>
<p>
  [32] The second set of claims is for money to which the respondent says he is 
  entitled upon withdrawal from the partnership. These matters (other than the 
  claim for a larger share of the 2000 profits which is specifically not arbitrable) 
  are clearly in connection with the withdrawal provisions of the partnership 
  agreement and must be referred for arbitration. </p>
<p>
  [33] The other claim in this group is the validity of the non-competition clause 
  of the Partnership Agreement; again, that is a matter that arises in connection 
  with that agreement and must be brought before an arbitrator.</p>
<p>
  [34] The final claim relates to the loan. In my view, this is also a claim which 
  is connected with the business, conduct and administration of the firm, and 
  therefore falls within the general resort to arbitration. The respondent argued 
  that the loan arose from a letter agreement and not from the Partnership Agreement. 
  That point is answered by the language of the arbitration clause, which refers 
  to matters &quot;in connection with&quot; the Partnership Agreement, and includes 
  all conduct of firm business and affairs. </p>
<p>
  SUMMARY</p>
<p>
  [35] The motion judge erred in his conclusion that the three types of claims 
  brought by the respondent are excluded from arbitration under the Partnership 
  Agreement. They are each of a type that comes within the general resort to arbitration. 
  </p>
<p>
  [36] The action must therefore be stayed and the claims referred to arbitration 
  in accordance with the terms of the arbitration clause and Schedule under the 
  Partnership Agreement except for the claim regarding profit allocation for the 
  2000 year, which is expressly stated to be non-arbitrable.</p>
<p>
  [37] In light of my conclusion that all of the respondent's claims fall within 
  the arbitration clause of the agreement or are non-justiciable, it is unnecessary 
  to deal with issue number 3, the motion judge's alternative decision under s. 
  7(5) of the Act in the event that only one of the claims is subject to arbitration.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [38] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the motion judge and substitute 
  an order that the respondent's action be stayed. </p>
<p>
  [39] The appellant shall have its costs of the appeal and of the motion to quash 
  on a partial indemnity basis. If the parties cannot agree on the costs, the 
  appellant shall file its Bill of Costs within 7 days of release of these reasons, 
  and the respondent shall have 5 days thereafter to make any submissions. All 
  material is to be field to the attention of the Senior Legal Officer of the
