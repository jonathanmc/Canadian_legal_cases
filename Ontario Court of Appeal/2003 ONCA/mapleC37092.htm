<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Ellen M. Macdonald of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 7, 2001.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (the Bank) appeals from the judgment 
  of Ellen M. Macdonald J. setting aside the postponement agreements by which 
  its mortgage moved ahead of the two mortgages held by Maple Valley Acres Limited 
  (Maple Valley) and declaring that those two mortgages be restored to first and 
  second priority status with the Bank's mortgage reverting to third priority 
  status.</p>
<p>
  [2] The trial judge based her decision on her finding that the postponement 
  agreements were induced by a misrepresentation made to Maple Valley by a sub-agent 
  for the Bank. Maple Valley was told that the Bank's mortgages secured loans 
  for construction purposes. This was not so, but if it had been, Maple Valley 
  would have been legally obliged to postpone. The trial judge also found that 
  the removal of the Maple Valley mortgage from its original first priority unjustly 
  enriched the Bank without juristic justification and that this also entitled 
  Maple Valley to the remedy she granted.</p>
<p>
  [3] Because of her main conclusion, the trial judge dismissed as moot the claim 
  of Maple Valley for damages for negligence against Keyser, Mason, Ball (KMB), 
  their solicitors. Any negligence by KMB in permitting its client to sign the 
  postponement agreements was rendered harmless once those agreements were set 
  aside. The Bank appeals from the trial judge's order that it pay KMB's costs 
  by way of a Sanderson order.</p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge also dismissed the third party claim for indemnity brought 
  by the Bank against Fraser and Beatty and one of its lawyers, Gary Walters. 
  They were the solicitors for 620923 Ontario Inc. (620923), the purchaser of 
  the mortgaged lands and the mortgagor in each of the three mortgages. Mr. Walters, 
  who made the misrepresentation, was found by the trial judge to have acted as 
  a sub-agent for the Bank in securing the postponement agreements from Maple 
  Valley. In dismissing the third party claim, the trial judge denied Fraser and 
  Beatty and Mr. Walters their costs because of her view of Mr. Walters' conduct. 
  They cross-appeal from this costs order.</p>
<p>
  [5] Although counsel ably canvassed a number of matters in argument, in our 
  view, the disposition of the Bank's challenge to the declaration granted at 
  trial turns on a single issue: when Mr. Walters made the misrepresentation, 
  was he acting within the scope of his authority?</p>
<p>
  [6] There is no dispute that Mr. Walters made the misrepresentation to Maple 
  Valley and that it caused Maple Valley to sign the postponement agreements. 
  Moreover, Mr. Aalto for the Bank properly concedes that to a limited extent 
  Mr. Walters was acting as agent for the Bank's solicitor, Mr. Vukelich when 
  he dealt with Maple Valley. Counsel says that Mr. Walters' authority simply 
  did not extend to making this misrepresentation but he fairly acknowledges that 
  if he is wrong, Maple Valley is entitled to rescission of the postponement agreements 
  because of the misrepresentation.</p>
<p>
  [7] The trial judge found that Mr. Vukelich asked Mr. Walters to obtain postponement 
  agreements from Maple Valley in order that the Bank's third mortgage could become 
  a first mortgage. She also found that the misrepresentation by Mr. Walters was 
  made in the course of this agency relationship with Mr. Vukelich and that the 
  Bank is therefore bound by it. In other words Mr. Walters acted within the scope 
  of his authority.</p>
<p>
  [8] The trial judge's conclusion that Mr. Walters acted within the scope of 
  his authority is a finding of fact for which there was ample evidence, including 
  Mr. Vukelich's testimony and his correspondence with Mr. Walters. Mr. Vukelich 
  gave Mr. Walters the open-ended mandate to obtain the postponement agreements 
  for the Bank. He did not limit his instructions in any way. It was open to the 
  trial judge to conclude that Mr. Walters acted within the scope of his authority. 
  There is no palpable error in the trial judge's finding. Indeed, we agree with 
  it.</p>
<p>
  [9] It is conceded that the rescission of the postponement agreements flows 
  directly from this finding. We agree with the trial judge's conclusion that 
  they must be set aside and the first priority of the Maple Valley mortgage restored. 
  </p>
<p>
  [10] We also agree with her that this relief is justified on the basis of unjust 
  enrichment. It is not disputed that the switch in priorities constitutes an 
  enrichment of the Bank and a deprivation to Maple Valley. The only question 
  is whether there is a juridical reason for the Bank to maintain its enrichment.</p>
<p>
  [11] Since the postponement agreements must be set aside, they cannot provide 
  the juridical justification for this, nor can the lending agreement between 
  the Bank and 620923. While the lending agreement entitled the Bank to the security 
  of a first mortgage, the Bank made this loan without observing it and knowing 
  that its mortgage security would be in third place. The Bank cannot rely on 
  an agreement it chooses not to observe as juridical justification.</p>
<p>
  [12] By restoring the proper order of priority to the three mortgages the trial 
  judge provided fair redress of the unjust enrichment. The remedy cannot be said 
  to be an error on the basis that it, in effect, overrides legally binding postponement 
  agreements. There were none here. Moreover, while it is not necessary to decide, 
  we are of the view that the appropriate remedy for unjust enrichment should 
  be driven by what simple fairness requires, which may include the setting aside 
  of a valid contract in appropriate circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [13] We also find no error in the order that the Bank pay the costs of KMB by 
  way of a Sanderson order. It was proper for Maple Valley to sue both the Bank 
  and KMB. The action against KMB was dismissed because Maple Valley was entirely 
  successful against the Bank. In these circumstances, it was an appropriate exercise 
  of discretion for the trial judge to require the Bank rather than Maple Valley 
  to pay KMB's costs.</p>
<p>
  [14] We would therefore dismiss the Bank's appeal.</p>
<p>
  [15] We would, however, allow the cross-appeal. The trial judge deprived Fraser 
  and Beatty of its costs because of the role of Mr. Walters in achieving the 
  postponement agreements. In her reasons on costs, the trial judge implies that 
  Mr. Walters' professional conduct was somehow improper. </p>
<p>
  [16] In our view there is no basis for this view. While the trial judge says 
  that it was open to her to draw an adverse inference against Fraser and Beatty 
  and Mr. Walters because the latter did not testify at trial, she does not proceed 
  to draw any such inference. Moreover, she says that the fact that he did not 
  testify does not influence her discretion in awarding costs. While she appears 
  not to have accepted Mr. Walters' explanation made on discovery (and read in 
  at trial) of the source of the information on which he based what turned out 
  to be a misrepresentation, she makes no finding as to why he made it. Mr. Walters' 
  non-response to Mr. Rosenblatt cannot create an &quot;appearance of complicity&quot; 
  in achieving the postponement agreements. There is simply no basis for that 
  conclusion or the innuendo that goes with it.</p>
<p>
  [17] We therefore find no foundation for the trial judge's apparent adverse 
  conclusion about Mr. Walters' conduct. This being so, there is no reason why 
  Fraser and Beatty and Mr. Walters should be denied their party-and-party costs.</p>
<p>
  [18] We would therefore allow the cross-appeal. </p>
<p>
  [19] We invite the respondents to provide us with written submissions on the 
  costs of the proceedings in this court within two weeks of the release of these 
  reasons. The appellant shall then respond within a further week.</p>
