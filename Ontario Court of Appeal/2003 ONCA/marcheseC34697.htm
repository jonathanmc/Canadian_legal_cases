<p>On appeal from a judgment of Justice Mary Anne Sanderson of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 30, 2000. </p>
<p class="boldcenter">COSTS ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our endorsement dismissing the appeal and cross-appeal, we stated that, 
  subject to submissions, there would be no order as to costs as success on appeal 
  was divided. However, we accept Mr. Falco's submission that, because his sole 
  involvement in the appeal was as a respondent by cross-appeal, he was, in fact, 
  a successful party.</p>
<p>
  [2] No basis has been demonstrated for departing from the usual practice that 
  costs should follow the event. Assuming that Mr. Marchese paid Mr. Falco's legal 
  fees relating to the appeal, that, in itself, does not deprive Mr. Falco of 
  his claim for costs. Rather, it may oblige Mr. Falco to account to Mr. Marchese 
  for any costs that Mr. Falco actually recovers.</p>
<p>
  [3] Based on the material submitted, Mr. Falco's costs of the cross-appeal are 
  fixed at $5000 on a partial indemnity basis, $419.95 for disbursements, and 
  applicable G.S.T.</p>
