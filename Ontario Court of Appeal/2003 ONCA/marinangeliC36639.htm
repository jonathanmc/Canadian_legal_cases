<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Victor Paisley of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated May 9, 2001.</p>
<p>WEILER J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I. OVERVIEW</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, Mr. Marinangeli, appeals the order of Paisley J. that he 
  pay child and spousal support to the respondent, Mrs. Marinangeli, retroactive 
  to the beginning of 1997, based on material changes in his circumstances within 
  the meaning of the Minutes of Settlement (the &quot;Minutes&quot;) between the 
  parties. The appeal raises two main issues. The first is whether the trial judge 
  seriously misapprehended the evidence. The second is whether he erred in ordering 
  that support be retroactive to 1997 on the basis that the appellant had an implicit 
  obligation under the Minutes to disclose two material changes in his circumstances 
  and that he did not do so. Subsidiary issues include whether the appellant's 
  profit resulting from the realization of certain stock options should have been 
  considered as income for purposes of ascertaining support in 1997 and whether 
  that profit constituted a material change of circumstances. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant submits that he should only be obligated to pay child support 
  in accordance with the Guidelines from August 1998 when the respondent's lawyer 
  wrote a letter to the appellant's lawyer referring to the Federal Child Support 
  Guidelines, SOR/97-175 (the &quot;Guidelines&quot;) that had come into force 
  in May 1997 and requesting the appellant's tax return for 1997. Prior to that, 
  the appellant had been paying child and spousal support pursuant to Minutes 
  entered into in October 1996 that took effect on January 1, 1997. He was not 
  in default respecting any support payments. The appellant agrees that from and 
  after August 1998 he should pay the amount of chid support contained in the 
  Tables of the Guidelines but objects to paying the expenses for the child's 
  private school in addition to this amount.</p>
<p>
  [3] In relation to spousal support the appellant's position is that he should 
  not be obligated to pay increased support until the date the application for 
  spousal support was filed in February 1999. He also submits that the trial judge 
  erred in awarding the quantum of spousal support he did. </p>
<p>
  [4] For the reasons that follow, I would hold that although the trial judge 
  did misapprehend some evidence, his errors were not sufficiently palpable and 
  important nor did they have a sufficiently decisive effect so as to justify 
  appellate intervention. In relation to spousal and child support I would hold 
  that the profit realized by the appellant from the exercise of his stock options 
  was income and constituted a material change in circumstances under the Minutes. 
  This is not a case like Miglin v. Miglin, [2003] S.C.J. 21, where the parties 
  had entered into a separation agreement providing for a full and final release 
  of all future obligations. Rather, in this case the parties expressly agreed 
  in the Minutes that spousal and child support could be varied if there was a 
  material change in circumstances. I would further hold that it was within the 
  trial judge's discretion to award retroactive support as the criteria for making 
  such an award are met. I would allow the appeal only with respect to the award 
  of retroactive child support prior to May 1, 1997 before the Guidelines came 
  into force. In all other respects I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  II. BACKGROUND FACTS </p>
<p>
  [5] The parties were married in August of 1973 and separated in October of 1992 
  after a nineteen-year marriage. </p>
<p>
  [6] At the time of their marriage the respondent, then 22 years old, was employed 
  as a secretary. In the early years of their marriage the respondent supported 
  the appellant, while he attended university. He completed his B.A., M.B.A. and 
  obtained his C.A. designation. The appellant also contributed by working part 
  time. In 1983, the parties agreed that the respondent would no longer work outside 
  the home but would become a full time homemaker. There is one child of the marriage, 
  Rachel, born in 1984. </p>
<p>
  [7] In June of 1993, litigation between the parties commenced. The case was 
  about to be tried when Minutes were signed in October of 1996. Both parties 
  were represented by counsel. </p>
<p> [8] Although certain terms of the Minutes were incorporated into a judgment, 
  the spousal support, child support and life insurance provisions were not. The 
  relevant portions of the Minutes are as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The parties share joint custody of Rachel with her primary residence in 
    the Respondent's home (para. 1);</li>
  <li>The parties agree there will be full disclosure between them in all matters 
    affecting the welfare of the child (para. 3)</li>
  <li>Commencing January 1, 1997 the Appellant will pay $2000/month for the support 
    of Rachel (para. 6). Pursuant to paragraph 7, the parties acknowledge that 
    they have been made aware of the proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act 
    with respect to the treatment of child support and agree that the child support 
    is to be deductible/ taxable notwithstanding the passage of such legislation.</li>
  <li>The Appellant agrees to pay the cost of tuition, books, uniforms, school 
    trips and all related activity fees associated with Rachel's attendance at 
    Havergal College (para. 8). </li>
  <li>The Appellant is also responsible to pay the cost of Rachel's post-secondary 
    education to the completion of one degree or until she becomes 22 years of 
    age (para. 9).</li>
  <li>Commencing January 1, 1997, the Appellant will pay $6000/month for the support 
    of the Respondent (para. 10). </li>
  <li>The Respondent is entitled to earn income or supplement her income by up 
    to $25,000 annually without this income constituting a material change in 
    her circumstances (para. 19). </li>
  <li>The amount of child and spousal support will be indexed at one year intervals 
    commencing January 1, 1998, in accordance with the All Items Consumer Price 
    Index for the City of Toronto with base year 1981 equal to 100. Once the information 
    is obtained any shortfall in payments that have accumulated will be immediately 
    paid by the Appellant (paras. 14 &amp; 15).</li>
  <li>The issues of joint custody, spousal and child support, the amounts of the 
    life annuity policy, and life insurance may be varied if there is a material 
    change in circumstances ( para. 16).</li>
  <li>Provision is made for medical and dental expenses, and life insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [9] In accordance with the Minutes the respondent received property comprised 
  of the matrimonial home having an equity value at the time of $90,000, and a 
  1990 Acura valued at $20,000. The appellant paid off the second mortgage on 
  the matrimonial home worth approximately $38,300, a third mortgage and the respondent's 
  legal fees of $25,000 (The appellant stated he had also paid off outstanding 
  joint loans and credit card debt of over $38,000 after the parties separated).</p>
<p>
  [10] Prior to signing the Minutes on October 11, 1996 the parties had attended 
  a pre-trial conference in May of that year. The appellant's pre-trial conference 
  memorandum indicated that he anticipated a decrease in his income. The anticipated 
  decrease was due to the fact that the appellant, at that time a senior vice 
  president with the Toronto Dominion Bank , had deferred bonuses dating back 
  to 1992-1993, that ended in 1996. All other things being equal his income would 
  then be reduced. </p>
<p>
  [11] The appellant's financial statement sworn October 10, 1996 disclosed his 
  income as $307,925.00, including a deferred bonus from 1993 of $24,500 and phantom 
  stock bonuses totalling about $21,000. The portion of the financial statement 
  showing his property indicates that he had phantom stock units, that is, notional 
  units of stock taxed at full rates based on underlying stock performance. They 
  had a value as at the date of separation of $76,361 and there is a notation 
  on the financial statement that it would be &quot;double dipping&quot; to include 
  this property as subject to an order of support. In addition, stock options 
  are listed as a &quot;contingent asset through employer since 1993, approximately 
  45,500 options, only 15,500 have vested, value unknown as depends upon when 
  options cashed and value of stock at the time.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [12] The sworn financial statement contained the usual declaration, &quot;I 
  do not anticipate any material changes in the information set out above.&quot; 
  </p>
<p>
  [13] On October 11, 1996, the day after signing the Minutes, and before the 
  support provisions in the Minutes came into force on January 1, 1997, the appellant 
  cashed in $27,850 worth of stock options. He testified that he did this in order 
  to fund part of his obligations under the Minutes. In addition, the appellant 
  cashed in options totalling $225,186 in late December of 1996, that settled 
  in early 1997. According to the appellant's affidavit filed in these proceedings, 
  his employment income for 1997 included gains of $477,503 from stock options 
  and $595,340 from phantom options, (referred to collectively as options) for 
  a gain of over $1,000,000 during the fourteen months after the agreement was 
  signed. The motivating forces behind the appellant's decision to cash the options 
  were the increase in price in the shares of the Toronto Dominion Bank and his 
  need for funds. The appellant used the funds he received from the exercise of 
  options to further fund the settlement he had made with the respondent, to purchase 
  a recreational property, and to pay taxes. He also used the funds to purchase 
  TD bank stock because, contrary to his stated expectation, his income increased 
  and he is required as part of his employment to hold twice his yearly salary 
  in TD bank stock. The appellant also received an increase in his base salary 
  of about $6,000 in 1997 to $166,000 and his bonus for the year at $200,000 was 
  almost double what it had been in 1996. The total of these two amounts, $366,000, 
  was about $60,000 more than his salary plus bonuses in 1996. The appellant also 
  continued to receive further stock options as part of his compensation.</p>
<p>
  [14] The appellant did not advise the respondent that he had cashed in stock 
  options or that his annual compensation had increased. The parties agree that 
  the earliest the respondent could have requested the appellant's tax return 
  for 1997 was May of 1998. On August 19, 1998, the respondent's lawyer wrote 
  to the appellant's lawyer advising she had been consulted with respect to the 
  impact of the Guidelines that had come into force on May 1, 1997 and requested 
  a copy of the appellant's 1997 income tax return (as well as the 1996 tax return). 
  When counsel for the appellant replied on October 23, 1998, he did not enclose 
  the appellant's tax return. Instead, he requested the respondent's tax return. 
  Eventually, tax returns were exchanged and these proceedings were commenced 
  in February of 1999.</p>
<p>
  [15] The appellant is presently Executive Vice President and Chief Financial 
  Officer of the TD Bank Financial Group. He was approximately 51 at the date 
  of trial April 30, 2001 and had remarried in 1995. His spouse works outside 
  the home. By 2001, the appellant's salary and bonus had increased to $890,039. 
  His net worth was approximately $2.5 million without including the condominium 
  and the cottage he had purchased and placed in his second wife's name, and excluding, 
  as well, the value of his pension and stock options. </p>
<p>
  [16] At the time of the trial the respondent's net worth was approximately $120,000. 
  The trial judge found that although the matrimonial home increased in value 
  substantially, her debts did as well. She was two years in arrears with respect 
  to taxes owing to Revenue Canada; the property taxes on her home were in arrears, 
  her bank line of credit was near its limit; she had borrowed money from her 
  aged mother; her home was in need of substantial repair and she was in need 
  of dental care. She attempted to return to school after separation but found 
  it too difficult. She had been in therapy on and off since the parties' separation. 
  At the time Minutes were signed in October of 1996 she was living with a man 
  who was unable to contribute much to her support. As of the date of trial the 
  relationship had ended. The respondent was now over 50, had no special qualifications, 
  and felt she was unable to work outside the home.</p>
<p>
  III. THE TRIAL JUDGE'S REASONS</p>
<p>
  [17] The trial judge's reasons are reported at (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 179 (Sup. 
  Ct.). The trial judge ordered that spousal support be increased from $6000 a 
  month under the Minutes to $12,000 a month for 1997; $8000 a month for 1998; 
  $9500 a month for 1999 and $10,500 a month from January 1, 2000. He ordered 
  that child support be $104,613 for 1997; $22,288 for 1998; $42,769 for 1999; 
  and $54,142 for 2000. For 2001, monthly child support payments were increased 
  from $2000 a month to $5,841.90 per month or $70,102.80 a year. The amounts 
  ordered for child support were the Guideline amounts and were to be paid in 
  addition to the private school fees the appellant was obliged to pay pursuant 
  to the Minutes.</p>
<p> [18] The trial judge found as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Mr. Marinangeli had two material changes in circumstances after he signed 
    the Minutes. The first was the profit he realized on his options in 1997. 
    The second was when his income from employment substantially increased. </li>
  <li>Mr. Marinangeli was implicitly obliged to notify Mrs. Marinangeli of each 
    material change in circumstances because he represented that he anticipated 
    a reduction in his income prior to signing the Minutes, the material changes 
    occurred within a very short time afterwards and it would be unreasonable 
    to expect Mrs. Marinangeli to commence a variation application shortly after 
    the minutes were executed to determine whether the appellant's circumstances 
    had changed. Mrs. Marinangeli had no reason to commence such an application 
    given Mr. Marinangeli's statement as to his anticipated income, the recent 
    settlement and the fact the parties had just engaged in four years of litigation. 
  </li>
  <li>While the date of filing an application may be a practical norm from which 
    to order an increase in support, it would be unfair to deny Mrs. Marinangeli 
    the benefit of the material changes in circumstances that had occurred. Even 
    when her request for disclosure was made, in August 1998, Mr. Marinangeli's 
    response to that request was delayed for four months. The policy of encouraging 
    negotiation and settlement of family law matters would not be enhanced if 
    the Court were to approve what would be in effect a harsh limitation period 
    with respect to arrears of support. In this case the result of that approach 
    would be a windfall to Mr. Marinangeli. Mr. Marinangeli would not suffer any 
    hardship by being ordered to pay support in accordance with the Guidelines 
    from the beginning of 1997. Even although the Guidelines were not in effect 
    when the options were exercised they provide an appropriate measure of the 
    fair level of child support payable by Mr. Marinangeli.</li>
  <li> In relation to child support, there was no 'clear and compelling evidence' 
    for departing from the Guideline figures. Counsel for Mr. Marinangeli conceded 
    that the table amount should be applied from the date the application was 
    commenced. A childcare budget was not required. It would be an exercise in 
    imagination. Mr. Marinangeli had not rebutted the presumption in favour of 
    awarding the applicable table amount for child support. Although Mr. Marinangeli 
    would be obliged to continue to provide for the child's private schooling 
    pursuant to the Minutes, child support should not be less than the amount 
    specified by the Guidelines. The support would have been used and would be 
    used appropriately to meet the child's present and future needs. Mrs. Marinangeli 
    was entitled to an appropriate level of discretionary spending for Rachel 
    consistent with Mr. Marinangeli's earnings. Mrs. Marinangeli had indicated 
    a wish to save money in the event that the child decided to pursue a career 
    as a psychiatrist. The Minutes only provided for Mr. Marinangeli to pay for 
    one university degree or until she attained the age of 22. </li>
  <li>With respect to spousal support, if Mrs. Marinangeli had returned to work 
    post separation, due to her limited education and lack of recent work experience, 
    she would not have been able to achieve financial independence in any practicable 
    sense; at the most she would have been able to contribute to her support to 
    some degree. Mrs. Marinangeli was devoted to her parental responsibilities, 
    a role Mr. Marinageli had encouraged during marriage. There was little merit 
    in the argument that Mrs. Marinangeli had failed to do what she could have 
    done to achieve self-sufficiency. The argument that Mrs. Marinageli's budgeted 
    needs are met when the child support is taken into consideration &quot;&#133;fails 
    to adequately address the contribution that Mrs. Marinangeli made during this 
    lengthy marriage, and the advantage Mr. Marinangeli gained by being able to 
    continue his education while Mrs Maringeli contributed to his support, and 
    then by being able to devote himself to his career advancement while Mrs. 
    Marinangeli assumed childcare responsibilities for Rachel.&quot; Mr. Marinangeli's 
    post-settlement enrichment is attributable in part to the contribution made 
    by Mrs. Marinangeli during the course of their marriage. The increase in spousal 
    support and award of retroactive support was justified. The amounts awarded 
    took into account the indirect benefits of increased child support and allowed 
    for financial contributions by Mrs. Marinangeli's cohabitant during the time 
    he lived with her.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  IV. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  A. Did the Trial Judge Materially Misapprehend the Evidence?</p>
<p>
  i. Standard of Review </p>
<p>
  [19] There is no issue as to the standard of review. Appellate courts should 
  not overturn support orders unless the reasons disclose an error in principle, 
  a significant misapprehension of the evidence, or unless the award is clearly 
  wrong: Hickey v. Hickey, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 518. More recently, in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 
  [2002] S.C.J. No. 31, the Supreme Court held that absent the judge at first 
  instance committing an error of law by failing to apply the correct legal standard, 
  appellate intervention in a judge's findings of fact is only appropriate where 
  there has been a &quot;palpable and overriding error&quot; and that the standard 
  of review for inferences of fact is also &quot;palpable and overriding error&quot;. 
  </p>
<p>
  [20] In a subsequent decision, Prud'homme v. Prud'homme, [2002] S.C.J. No.86, 
  the Supreme Court held that the Housen rule does not preclude an appellate court 
  from identifying errors in the findings of fact, where those errors are sufficiently 
  palpable and important, and have had a sufficiently decisive effect, that they 
  would justify intervention and review on appeal. It is not sufficient, however, 
  to identify errors in the details of the findings of fact made by the judge 
  of first instance if the overall characterization of the effects of the facts 
  is correct in law.</p>
<p>
  ii. Material Misapprehension of the Evidence</p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant alleges that the trial judge misapprehended the substance 
  of the evidence in several respects. The trial judge referred to the application 
  as being an interim application. It was not. On reading the reasons of the trial 
  judge as a whole it is clear, however, that he was well aware that he was not 
  dealing with an interim application for support. For example, the trial judge 
  ordered different amounts for spousal support for 1997, 1998, and 1999, which 
  he could not have done on an interim application. He did not misapprehend the 
  nature of the application.</p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge did, however, misapprehend the evidence in other respects 
  as alleged. He misapprehended the date when the appellant represented that his 
  income would not increase but would, instead, decrease. The trial judge's reasons, 
  at paragraph 12, indicate that the appellant, &quot;&#133;agreed that his pretrial 
  memorandum, filed shortly before the minutes of settlement were executed indicated 
  that he anticipated a reduction in his income in subsequent years.&quot; At 
  paragraph 20 of his reasons, the trial judge stated, &quot;Furthermore, in that 
  just prior to the execution of the minutes of settlement Mr. Marinangeli had 
  taken the position that he anticipated a reduction in his income, there was 
  no reason for Mrs. Marinangeli to believe otherwise. I weigh Mr. Marinangeli's 
  pre-settlement statement heavily in that regard.&quot; The statement respecting 
  a reduction in income was made in the appellant's pre-trial memorandum, which 
  was filed in May 1996; whereas the Minutes were signed in October 1996. However, 
  the appellant's statement of financial affairs sworn the day before the Minutes 
  were executed confirmed that he did not anticipate any material changes in the 
  information given as to his income or property. The appellant's counsel concedes 
  that s 56 (4) (a) of the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, effectively renders 
  all domestic contracts, such as separation agreements, agreements of the utmost 
  good faith with respect to financial matters at least until the agreement is 
  signed. As a result, the fact that Mr. Marinangeli represented that his income 
  would modestly decrease at the pre-trial in May 1996 as opposed to the day before 
  the agreement was signed in October 1996 is of no import because he had an ongoing 
  duty of disclosure at least until the minutes were signed: See Quesnel v. Nadon-Quesnel 
  (2001) 24 R.F.L. (5th) 89 (Ont. Sup. Ct.).</p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge further misapprehended the date the Minutes were signed 
  when he stated they were signed in 1997; they were signed at the end of October 
  1996. However, January 1, 1997 was the date the provisions in the Minutes respecting 
  child and spousal support came into force and in my view nothing turns on the 
  trial judge's misstatement.</p>
<p>
  [24] In addition, the trial judge misapprehended the extent of the financial 
  gain the appellant realized from his options the day after the Minutes were 
  signed when he stated the appellant realized a financial gain of $1,000,000. 
  The day after the Minutes were signed in October the appellant exercised options 
  for a $27,000 profit and in late December he exercised further options that 
  settled in early January just after the support provisions in the Minutes came 
  into force for a further profit of about $225,000. In all, about $1,000,000 
  profit from options was realized in 1997. </p>
<p>
  [25] In my opinion, however, the trial judge's misapprehensions as to the dates 
  the gains from the options were realized do not affect the central part of his 
  finding. That finding is that very shortly after the Minutes were signed the 
  appellant cashed in options that resulted in his income significantly increasing, 
  not modestly decreasing, as he had represented. I would hold that the trial 
  judge's misapprehensions of evidence were not sufficiently palpable and important 
  and did not have a sufficiently decisive effect so as to justify appellate intervention. 
  I would dismiss the first ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [26] The facts seem to be relatively clearly established overall. The real issue 
  is whether the trial judge's characterization of the effects of those facts 
  is correct in law and whether he erred in principle in exercising his discretion 
  to award retroactive child and spousal support as he did. </p>
<p>
  B. Did the Trial Judge Err in Awarding Retroactive Child and Spousal Support?</p>
<p>
  i. The Trial Judge's Characterization of the Exercise of Options as Income and 
  Inclusion of the Profits for Purposes of Assessing Child and Spousal Support</p>
<p>
  [27] The appellant testified that his options were an accepted means of compensation 
  intended to keep the bank competitive in retaining its senior executives. The 
  trial judge accepted this evidence and held that as these options were acquired 
  as part of the appellant's remuneration from employment they should be treated 
  as income for the purpose of assessing both spousal and child support.</p>
<p>
  [28] As I have indicated, the Guidelines came into force in May 1997. The treatment 
  of option income for the purpose of assessing child support under the Guidelines 
  after that date is clear. Options granted as an employee benefit are to be valued 
  and added to a spouse's income for the year in which the options are exercised 
  under Schedule III and section 13 (1) of the Guidelines. Once the value of the 
  option has been determined the Court has a discretion to exercise under s. 17. 
  If, as a result of the exercise of the options, the court is of the opinion 
  that the spouse's income results in an amount that is not fair to the paying 
  spouse, for example because this is a one time payment, the court can look at 
  the spouse's income over the last three years and determine an amount that is 
  fair and reasonable in light of the receipt of a non-recurring amount during 
  those years. </p>
<p>
  [29] The appellant submits that the trial judge ought to have excluded the gain 
  the appellant realized from the exercise of his options for purposes of assessing 
  child support as was done in Arnold v. Washburn (2000), 10 R.F.L. (5th) 1 (Ont. 
  Sup. Ct.), aff'd (2001), 57 O.R. (3d) 287 (C.A.), leave to appeal to SCC refused 
  [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 82. In Arnold, supra, Rutherford J. held that he had a discretion 
  to exclude the profit realized from the exercise of stock options under the 
  Guidelines because that income was unlikely to recur in the future. The Court 
  of Appeal upheld the decision on the basis that the trial judge exercised his 
  discretion to determine the spouse's income under s. 17 of the Guidelines and 
  the exercise of discretion revealed no error in principle. Speaking for the 
  court, Carthy J.A. stated at para. 8, &quot;[w]ith some reservation, I am prepared 
  to assume that the stock option income was properly characterized as a non-recurring 
  amount in the circumstances of this case.&quot; The Court, at para. 9, did say 
  that the trial judge &quot;could have attributed the share of income or some 
  portion of it for Guideline purposes but chose not to.&quot; The Court agreed 
  with the trial judge at para. 23, that there was a &quot;huge imbalance in the 
  money power of the parties, which can and may well be operating unfairly to 
  the applicant.&quot; Excluding the stock option amount from Mr. Washburn's income, 
  the amount of child support under the Guidelines was inappropriately low and 
  there was a large discrepancy between the lifestyles the children would enjoy 
  with each party. Because two of the children were over the age of majority and, 
  under s. 3 (2) the Court had a discretion to order support in an amount different 
  than the amount in the Guideline Table, the court increased the amount of support 
  for these children. The Court commented, at para. 23, that, &quot;[t]here is 
  no doubt that this $3 million [from the exercise of options] added substantially 
  to the husband's financial ability to contribute to the children's support.&quot; 
  Arnold, supra, does not really assist the appellant as, in the end, the profit 
  from the exercise of the options, although not treated as income, was used to 
  arrive at the appropriate amount of support that the payor spouse should pay 
  for child support. I note that in MacDonald v. MacDonald (1997), 209 A.R. 178 
  (C.A.), the Alberta Court of Appeal held that the exercise of stock options 
  should form part of a payor's income as it enhanced the payor's ability to pay 
  support.</p>
<p>
  [30] While the courts have differed in their approach when dealing with non-recurring 
  income the recurring theme is that the child of the marriage should benefit 
  from a sudden increase in lifestyle and money available to the family. </p>
<p>
  [31] I now turn to a consideration of whether the exercise by the appellant 
  of his stock options in 1996 and 1997 should have been considered as income 
  for purposes of child support prior to the enactment of the Guidelines as amended 
  and for purposes of spousal support. In my opinion the trial judge did not err 
  in principle in including the gain from the options as income. (In some circumstances, 
  such as when options have been accumulated during marriage, it may be appropriate 
  to treat them as property rather than income: see Bell v. Glynn, [2000] B.C.J. 
  No. 1505 (S.C.). If treated as an asset, as stated by the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in Miglin,supra, at para. 94, &quot;[v]aluation of an asset necessarily takes 
  into account its characteristics including its potential income, capital appreciation 
  and risks.&quot; Either way options cannot be ignored.) </p>
<p>
  [32] The granting of options to the appellant continues on a regular basis as 
  part of his compensation. The appellant's financial statement for April 2001 
  showed that the number of options that had vested had grown to 92,900 from 15,500 
  in October 1996; while the number of unvested options was 92,650 from 30,000. 
  (Options that are unvested cannot be exercised, that is, they cannot be used 
  to buy stock, until a particular date in the future.)</p>
<p>
  [33] Options are comprised of two components, a cash component and a time component. 
  If the price at which the option can be exercised is less than the price of 
  the underlying stock, the option has a cash value. For example, if the option 
  gives the holder the right to purchase stock at $25 and the stock is priced 
  at $35 the option has a cash value of $10. That is the cash component of the 
  option. The fact that the option can be exercised to purchase stock for a particular 
  time period at a set price, in some cases many years, also has value. That is 
  the time component of the option and it decreases as the time for exercising 
  the option goes by. There is an interrelationship between the two components. 
  </p>
<p>
  [34] The appellant chose to exercise some of his options in 1996 and 1997. What 
  this means is that the receipt of some of the appellant's compensation was deferred 
  from the time the options were first granted in 1993 until he cashed some of 
  them in 1996 and 1997. The fact that the appellant deferred receipt of some 
  of his compensation by waiting until late 1996 and 1997 to exercise his options 
  does not mean that their essential characteristic as income changed. The trial 
  judge accepted the appellant's evidence that the reason further options have 
  not been exercised since 1997 is that the appellant hopes to realize a greater 
  profit from them by holding them for a longer period of time. The appellant's 
  evidence means that he has assumed the risk that, as the time component for 
  exercising the options declines, the cash component of the options will increase. 
  The fact that the appellant chooses not to take his compensation on a regular 
  basis but to defer taking it in the hopes of realizing a greater amount does 
  not mean, however, that the amounts realized should be excluded in considering 
  the appellant's support obligations. The exercise of the options is simply the 
  taking of deferred income at a particular time. In this case, the gain the appellant 
  realized from his options in 1997, approximately one million dollars, was an 
  appropriate factor for the trial judge to consider in making an order for spousal 
  support and for child support generally. I also note that option income generally 
  receives more favourable treatment for income tax purposes than regular income. 
  </p>
<p>
  ii. Payor's Income and the Issue of &quot;Double Dipping&quot;</p>
<p>
  [35] The appellant further submits that a portion of the trial judge's order 
  respecting support for 1997 is &quot;double dipping&quot; in the sense that 
  the value of some of the phantom stock was equalized and therefore already taken 
  into account when the parties separated. The appellant's position is that the 
  value of the phantom stock should therefore have been excluded from his income. 
  </p>
<p>
  [36] The issue of double dipping generally arises in respect of pensions that 
  have been equalized. When a payor spouse retires the spouse often seeks a reduction 
  of spousal support obligations because his income has been materially reduced 
  and post-retirement income is largely derived from the value of the asset that 
  has already been equalized. The argument is that when the capital value of the 
  asset has been divided the income stream should not be subject to division again. 
  </p>
<p>
  [37] In Boston v. Boston, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 413, Major J. concluded at para. 63 
  that it is generally unfair to allow the payee spouse to receive the benefit 
  of the pension both as an asset and then again as a source of income especially 
  where the payee spouse has received capital assets she retains to increase her 
  estate. A payee spouse is under an obligation to generate income from the assets 
  received upon separation. Compensatory support should not be awarded out of 
  property that has already been equalized. Once a spouse's need for support is 
  established and in order to avoid double recovery, the court, where practicable, 
  should focus on that portion of the payor's income and assets that were not 
  included as part of the equalization or division of net family property. Major 
  J. acknowledged, however, that double dipping cannot always be avoided. If the 
  payee spouse has received the matrimonial home as part of an equalization payment 
  upon separation, it may be unreasonable to expect her to generate investment 
  income from this asset. Recognizing that support payments should provide a level 
  of income sufficient to maintain a lifestyle that is comparable to that enjoyed 
  during marriage by allowing the spouse to remain in the home contributes to 
  this goal. Further, where spousal support is based mainly on need, rather than 
  compensation, double recovery may be permitted. He concluded, at para. 63, &quot;[d]ouble 
  recovery may be permitted where the payor spouse has the ability to pay, where 
  the payee spouse has made a reasonable effort to use the equalized assets in 
  an income-producing way and, despite this, an economic hardship from the marriage 
  or its breakdown persists.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [38] A further elaboration of the principles respecting double-dipping is articulated 
  in Meiklejohn v. Meiklejohn (2001), 19 R.F.L. (5th) 167 (Ont. C.A.), where Rosenberg 
  J.A. held that a court will not automatically exclude consideration of a payor's 
  pension income from his or her ability to pay support because the capital value 
  of the pension has been included in the equalization accounting. While it may 
  be generally unfair that the income stream from an asset that has already been 
  equalized be considered in determining support, there are a number of circumstances 
  where a court is justified in awarding support from pension income although 
  the value has already been included in equalization. There were a number of 
  factors that led Rosenberg J.A. to conclude that the rule against double dipping 
  did not apply to the case before him. A significant portion of the value of 
  the pension accrued after separation; spousal support was based on need; the 
  wife had limited ability to earn income; she had received only a modest amount 
  from the equalization of the property and the wife's share of the assets was 
  tied up in the matrimonial home from which she had no ability to generate income. 
  Based on the persisting economic hardship from the marriage or its breakdown 
  he ordered support out of the pension. </p>
<p>
  [39] In this case, there are a number of factors that lead me to conclude that 
  the general rule against double dipping does not apply to the phantom stock 
  bonus. At the time of separation the phantom stock was worth $76,000. At the 
  time the appellant filed his financial statement on October 10, 1996, the phantom 
  stock was worth $135,000. Thus, a significant portion of the profit from the 
  phantom stock arose after separation. Unlike the situation where the payor spouse 
  retires and has to rely on a decreased income the appellant's income increased. 
  The respondent is not hoarding her capital at the expense of the appellant. 
  She received a modest amount from the equalization of property and that property 
  was almost entirely comprised of the matrimonial home. The home is providing 
  shelter for herself and her daughter in accordance with the lifestyle to which 
  they were accustomed during marriage. The home is not an income-producing asset. 
  The trial judge found that the appellant was unable to contribute to her self-support 
  in a meaningful way and she was in debt. She demonstrated need and suffered 
  economic hardship from the marriage or its breakdown. Having regard to these 
  factors, the trial judge did not err in considering the phantom stock bonus 
  as part of the appellant's income. </p>
<p>
  [40] Inasmuch as the parties separated in 1992 and the options are shown as 
  being received from 1993 onwards, these options would not have been subject 
  to an equalization payment and no issue of double dipping arises in relation 
  to them. </p>
<p>
  [41] I would dismiss the submission that the trial judge's order be reduced 
  on account of double dipping. </p>
<p>
  iii. The Trial Judge's Characterization of the Option Income and Increase in 
  Salary, Plus Bonus, as a Material Change in Circumstances Pursuant to the Minutes</p>
<p>
  [42] In this case, no issue is raised respecting the conditions under which 
  the agreement was negotiated. No misrepresentation is alleged. Unlike in Miglin, 
  supra, the respondent does not seek to set aside a provision of the agreement 
  reflected in the Minutes. It is not suggested that enforcement of the agreement 
  no longer reflects the original intention of the parties or that it is no longer 
  in substantial compliance with the Act. What the respondent seeks, instead, 
  is to enforce the provision of the Minutes that support may be revised where 
  there has been a material change of circumstances. Thus, the court should afford 
  the agreement great weight. In enforcing the agreement this Court must interpret 
  the meaning of the words &quot;a material change of circumstances&quot; as used 
  in the Minutes of Settlement. </p>

<p>[43] For ease of reference, I have reproduced the relevant portion from paragraph 
  16 of the Minutes below: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;child and spousal support&#133;may be varied if there is a material change 
  in circumstances. </p>
<p>
  [44] The appellant submits that the words &quot;a material change in circumstances&quot; 
  in the Minutes should be given the same meaning as in Miglin, supra. That is, 
  a material change is one that was not foreseeable as part of the ordinary course 
  of living at the time the Minutes were signed. The respondent agreed she knew 
  the appellant had options and that they were valuable. The appellant submits 
  that at the time the agreement was signed it was foreseeable that he would exercise 
  the options at different times in the future and their exercise did not represent 
  a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by 
  the parties at the time the agreement was signed. (See Miglin, supra, at para. 
  91). In support of this submission the appellant relies on Miglin, supra, at 
  para. 89 where the court stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  We stress that a certain degree of change is foreseeable most of the time. The 
  prospective nature of these agreements cannot be lost on the parties and they 
  must be presumed to be aware that the future is, to a greater or lesser extent, 
  uncertain. It will be unconvincing, for example, to tell a judge that an agreement 
  never contemplated that the job market might change, or that parenting responsibilities 
  under an agreement might be somewhat more onerous than imagined, or that a transition 
  into the workforce might be challenging. Negotiating parties should know that 
  each person's health cannot be guaranteed as a constant. An agreement must also 
  contemplate, for example, that the relative values of assets in a property division 
  will not necessarily remain the same. Housing prices may rise or fall. A business 
  may take a downturn or become more profitable. Moreover, some changes may be 
  caused or provoked by the parties themselves. A party may remarry or decide 
  not to work. Where the parties have demonstrated their intention to release 
  one another from all claims to spousal support, changes of this nature are unlikely 
  to be considered sufficient to justify dispensing with that declared intention. 
  That said, we repeat that a judge is not bound by the strict Pelech standard 
  to intervene only once a change is shown to be &quot;radical&quot;. Likewise, 
  it is unnecessary for the party seeking court-ordered support to demonstrate 
  that the circumstances rendering enforcement of the agreement inappropriate 
  are causally connected to the marriage or its breakdown. The test here is not 
  strict foreseeability; a thorough review of case law leaves virtually no change 
  entirely unforeseeable. The question, rather, is the extent to which the unimpeachably 
  negotiated agreement can be said to have contemplated the situation before the 
  court at the time of the application.</p>
<p>[45] The comments of the Supreme Court in Miglin, supra, were intended to address 
  the situation where the parties chose to release one another from all future 
  support obligations by a one-time payment of lump sum support. Since no future 
  adjustments were envisaged, the parties were expected to consider such foreseeable 
  future changes in the ordinary course of living as an increase or decrease in 
  income before arriving at the amount of the one time payment.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [46] This is not a situation like Miglin, supra. In this case, the parties demonstrated 
  an intention that the amount of spousal support should change if there was a 
  material change of one party's circumstances in the sense that a party's income 
  increased or decreased. For example, in paragraph 18 of the Minutes, the parties 
  agreed that the appellant's &quot;&#133;retirement from active employment may 
  constitute a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify an application 
  for variation of the quantum of spousal support&#133;&quot; In paragraph 19 
  the parties agreed that, &quot;The Respondent may earn income or supplement 
  her income with up to $25,000 annually without this income, in and of itself, 
  constituting a material change in the Respondent's circumstances.&quot; The 
  implication is that if the respondent earned more than $25,000 this could be 
  a material change in circumstances that would lead to a reduction of the appellant's 
  support obligations. Read in context and as a whole the provision in the separation 
  agreement relating to a material change in circumstances did not exclude foreseeable 
  events such as an increase or decrease in income but the opposite.</p>
<p>
  [47] The appellant also submits that the exercise of his options was not a material 
  change in circumstances as that term is defined in Willick v. Willick, [1994] 
  3 S.C.R. 670, and L.G. v. B.G., [1995] 3 S.C.R. 370, namely, had the alleged 
  change been known, the support provision would not likely have been different. 
  The appellant says the respondent knew he had options and that they were valuable 
  at the time the Minutes were signed and thus their exercise would not have resulted 
  in a different support provision.</p>
<p>
  [48] I disagree. First, the appellant's financial statement shows the options 
  as a contingent asset whose value is unknown and depends upon when the options 
  are cashed. Since the appellant himself could not say what value his options 
  had at the time he entered into the Minutes or what their value would be until 
  they were cashed it ill befits him now to say that the respondent should have 
  known. Second, the parameters for the exercise of the options were not provided 
  in the appellant's financial statement so the respondent had no way of ascertaining 
  the value of the options in relation to the price of the underlying stock. Although 
  the appellant's financial statement disclosed that 15,500 options had vested, 
  it did not disclose the exercise price of the options, their expiry date or 
  when the balance of the 30,000 options would vest, their exercise price and 
  expiry date. Without knowing the parameters for the exercise of the options, 
  the respondent had no way of ascertaining the likelihood that the appellant 
  would cash in options within the next few months after the Minutes were signed. 
  The nature of the information about the options provided by the appellant before 
  the Minutes were signed made the respondent dependent on him for information 
  about their value when they were exercised and she was content with this. The 
  treatment afforded the options does not mean that their realization would have 
  no impact on support; it only means the parties were content to deal with that 
  impact if and when the options were exercised. </p>
<p>
  [49] Finally, the appellant submits that the exercise of his options is not 
  a material change in circumstances because their exercise lacks continuity. 
  I agree that a change in circumstances must be something that has some measure 
  of continuity: Lafferty v. Lafferty (1973), 12 R.F.L. 345 (Ont. C.A.). I disagree 
  that the options, in this case, lack continuity. There is continuity in the 
  frequency with which the options are awarded and continuity in the sense that 
  the options may be exercised over a period of time. If options are exercised 
  all at once it does not mean they lack continuity; only that the taking of profit, 
  or income, has been deferred continuously from the grant and vesting of the 
  options until their exercise. I would dismiss the appellant's argument that 
  the exercise of the options was not a material change in circumstances. </p>
<p> [50] In 1997, the appellant's salary and bonus increased by nearly 20 per 
  cent over the cumulative total for 1996.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  This increase was also a material change in circumstances. Moreover a material 
  change in circumstances with respect to child support occurred when the Guidelines 
  came into force in May of 1997. The coming into force of the Guidelines creates 
  a right to bring pre-existing orders or agreements for child support before 
  the court and the court does not retain a residual discretion not to vary the 
  amount of support: see Wright v. Zaver (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 26 (C.A.); 24 F.L.R. 
  (5th) 207, (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [51] It would be artificial to restrict the analysis respecting support to the 
  financial effect of the particular change in circumstances that triggered the 
  application for support without inquiring into all the factors that may impact 
  on quantum. Thus, even if the appellant's exercise of his options was not a 
  material change in circumstances, the appellant's increase in salary and the 
  coming into force of the Guidelines were material changes in circumstances that 
  entitled the trial judge to consider the profit from the options in determining 
  the quantum of support.</p>
<p>
  iv. The Trial Judge's Characterization of the Appellant's Non-Disclosure as 
  the Breach of an Implicit Obligation to Disclose in the Circumstances</p>
<p>
  [52] The trial judge held that while the Minutes are silent as to whether the 
  appellant had an obligation to disclose the exercise of his options and increase 
  in salary, that obligation was implicit given the agreement that spousal and 
  child support could be varied in the event of a material change in circumstances 
  and the circumstances of this case. </p>
<p>
  [53] The appellant submits that the respondent had a duty to make inquiries 
  if there had been a change in circumstances and that the onus was on her to 
  obtain the information justifying a change in circumstances and that the trial 
  judge erred in implying a term of disclosure.</p>
<p>
  [54] Given the circumstances of this case I am satisfied that it was open to 
  the trial judge to imply a term that the appellant had a duty to disclose material 
  changes in his financial circumstances at least during the period before the 
  respondent would first have access to the appellant's income tax returns in 
  May 1998. The appellant's pre-settlement representations and the almost immediate 
  significant improvement in the appellant's financial position after the minutes 
  were signed provide the factual basis upon which to found such a duty.</p>
<p>
  [55] The trial judge did not specifically state on what legal basis he concluded 
  the obligation to disclose a material change in circumstance was implied. One 
  of the bases for implying a term in a contract is the presumed intention of 
  the parties: see C.P. Hotels Ltd. v. Bank of Montreal, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 711 per 
  Le Dain J., on behalf of the majority, at paras. 51-54. A contractual term may 
  be implied based on the presumed intention of the parties where it is necessary 
  to give business efficacy to the contract or where it meets the &quot;officious 
  bystander&quot; test: MJB Enterprises Ltd v. Defence Construction (1951) Ltd., 
  [1999] 1 S.C.R. 619 at paras. 27-29. It is not clear whether these are two separate 
  tests, but Iacobucci J. held that what is important in both formulations is 
  a focus on the intentions of the actual parties: MJB Enterprises, supra, at 
  para.29.</p>
<p>
  [56] It may also be worthwhile mentioning that ordinary contract law principles 
  do not entirely govern support obligations. In Miglin, supra, the Court rejected 
  the appellant's submission that a separation agreement was binding and could 
  only be set aside on the basis of unconscionability or on the application of 
  some other strict contractual principle. Instead, the Supreme Court commented 
  at para. 77: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [C]ontract law principles are not only better suited to the commercial context 
  but it is implicit in s. 15 of the 1985 Act that they were not intended to govern 
  the applicability of private contractual arrangements for spousal support. </p>
<p>
  [57] Thus, the Supreme Court recognized in Miglin, supra, that the self-interest 
  that prevails in ordinary commercial relationships does not meet the unique 
  concerns that arise in the post-divorce context.</p>
<p>
  (a) Presumed intentions of the parties where necessary to give business efficacy 
  </p>
<p>
  [58] In Martel Building Ltd. v. Canada, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 860, the Supreme Court 
  implied a term based on the presumed intention of the parties that the tender 
  calling authority had to be fair and consistent in its assessment of bids on 
  the basis that such a term was necessary to give business efficacy to the tendering 
  process. Speaking for the majority, Iacobucci and Major JJ. held at para. 88 
  that, &quot;This implication [of a duty of fairness] has a certain degree of 
  obviousness to it to the extent that the parties, if questioned, would clearly 
  agree that this obligation had been assumed.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [59] The discussion as to implied terms must therefore begin with a consideration 
  of the intention of the parties to the extent such intention can be ascertained 
  from the Minutes and surrounding documentation. </p>
<p>
  [60] Paragraph 3 of the Minutes provides: &quot;The parties agree that there 
  will be full disclosure between them in all matters affecting the welfare of 
  the child and that they will confer as often as necessary regarding any matter 
  requiring discussion [emphasis added].&quot; The effect of the words &quot;welfare 
  of the child&quot; is not to be measured in money only or physical comfort only; 
  it also includes the moral and religious welfare of the child, physical well 
  being and ties of affection. King v. Low, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 87. That said, the 
  appellant's undertaking of full disclosure of &quot;all matters affecting the 
  welfare of the child&quot; encompassed monetary matters that would affect the 
  child's level of physical comfort and an undertaking to confer about such matters.</p>
<p>
  [61] I also note that the Minutes envisaged an annual accounting with respect 
  to the maintenance of a life insurance policy on the appellant's life and an 
  annual adjustment in the amount of spousal and child support payable. Paragraphs 
  24 to 27 of the Minutes require the appellant to designate the respondent as 
  his beneficiary under a life insurance policy so long as he is obligated to 
  pay support and require the appellant to deliver proof on an annual basis that 
  the policy is in good standing. The Minutes also provide in paragraph 14 that 
  the amount of child and spousal support payable is to change at one-year intervals 
  commencing on the first day of January 1998, in accordance with the Consumer 
  Price Index for the City of Toronto. Paragraph 15 of the Minutes further provides, 
  in part: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The parties acknowledge that there will likely be a delay in the availability 
  of this information from Statistics Canada and agree that once the information 
  is obtained, any shortfall in payments that may have accumulated will be immediately 
  paid by the Petitioner.</p>
<p>
  Thus, once the information respecting the size of the increase in the Consumer 
  Price Index became known the Minutes envisaged a retroactive payment of support. 
  </p>
<p>
  [62] One of the documents that forms part of the factual matrix when the Minutes 
  were signed is the financial statement. As previously noted, that document indicated 
  that the appellant had stock options that were a contingent asset whose value 
  was unknown. The disclosure in the financial statement respecting the stock 
  options is indicative that the parties did not intend the value of the options 
  to be taken into account in respect of support at the time they entered into 
  the agreement but only if and when they were exercised. (This conclusion is 
  reinforced when contrasted with the position taken on the financial statement 
  with respect to phantom stock. In relation to the phantom stock, the appellant's 
  position was that they should be excluded from consideration on the basis they 
  had already been equalized and a current valuation of the phantom stock was 
  provided.) </p>
<p>
  [63] Read together and as a whole, the Minutes and financial statement are indicative 
  of an intention that the appellant would disclose a change in his financial 
  circumstances that would affect the physical comfort of the child and that adjustments 
  would be made to spousal and child support on an annual basis beginning in 1998.</p>
<p>
  [64] The underlying rationale for implying a term of business efficacy is that 
  it is necessary to make the transaction effective. In other words, if such a 
  term was not implied, the very rationale for entering into the Minutes would 
  be undermined. In the case of tendering contracts, bidders would not go to the 
  expense and time of preparing a tender if the tender calling authority did not 
  have an implied obligation to treat bidders fairly and equally. Here, it was 
  obvious to the trial judge that the policy of encouraging negotiation and settlement 
  of family law matters both under the Divorce Act and the Guidelines would be 
  undermined if the Court were to approve the appellant's non-disclosure of his 
  changes of circumstances within such a short time after signing the Minutes. 
  The lengthy protracted negotiations over four years, the appellant's representation 
  as to his financial situation, the disclosure respecting the options combined 
  with the very short time frame after signing the Minutes within which the options 
  were exercised, the fact that the appellant controlled the timing of the realization 
  of his income from the options that had vested, and the fact the respondent 
  had no means of accessing this information, are all factors supporting the trial 
  judge's conclusion that the appellant had an implicit obligation to disclose 
  his change in circumstances in order to give business efficacy to the agreement. 
  </p>
<p>
  [65] Before a court will imply a term based on the doctrine of &quot;business 
  efficacy&quot; and the presumed intention of the parties, there are additional 
  factors that must be met, as set forth by Professor G.H.L. Fridman, in his book 
  The Law of Contract in Canada, 3rd ed. (Scarborough: Carswell, 1994) at 475. 
  To be implied a term must be (a) reasonable and equitable; (b) capable of clear 
  expression; and (c) not contradictory of an express term in the contract. I 
  propose to address each of these considerations in turn.</p>
<p>
  (b) Reasonable and Equitable</p>
<p>
  [66] After four years of litigation, the trial judge held that it would be unreasonable 
  to require the respondent to initiate an application to vary spousal support 
  almost immediately after the Minutes had been signed. Existing property and 
  past earnings may usually be the best guide to future earnings but, as here, 
  that is not always the case. The trial judge held that the respondent was entitled 
  to rely on the appellant's representation. The appellant's representation that 
  he did not &quot;anticipate any material changes&quot; is essentially forward 
  looking. That is because the payment of support is generally in the future. 
  The earliest date that the Minutes envisaged an adjustment to support was in 
  January 1998 and the earliest the respondent could have been expected to request 
  the appellant's tax return was in May 1998. She had no independent means of 
  ascertaining the information for herself. The implication of a term relating 
  to disclosure in the interim was reasonable.</p>
<p>
  [67] In relation to spousal support, the trial judge held that the respondent 
  was entitled to some compensatory support and awarding support only from the 
  date of the application for support would be a windfall to the appellant. In 
  other words, the trial judge was of the opinion the appellant would be unjustly 
  enriched if the profit from the exercise of the options was excluded from consideration. 
  In relation to child support, I note the appellant's undertaking in Paragraph 
  3 of the Minutes. The implication of the term was equitable.</p>
<p>
  (c) Capable of Clear Expression</p>
<p>
  [68] The implication of the implied term may be expressed as follows: In the 
  particular circumstances of this case the payor spouse has an obligation to 
  disclose a material change in his financial circumstances at least until the 
  appellant would have access to the respondent's tax returns in May 1998. As 
  I have indicated, those circumstances were that the appellant represented he 
  did not anticipate any material changes to the information on the financial 
  statement he had sworn, the Minutes envisaged an increase in support based on 
  a material change in circumstances and contained certain obligations of disclosure, 
  the changes in circumstances occurred within such a short time after the Minutes 
  had been signed that the respondent could not reasonably have been expected 
  to ask the appellant if his circumstances had changed and the respondent could 
  not have known the information through independent inquiry. </p>
<p>
  (d) Not Contrary to Express Terms in the Agreement</p>
<p>
  [69] As discussed above, the implication of an implied term is not contrary 
  to any express term in the agreement. </p>
<p>
  [70] In sum, I would hold that the implication, by the trial judge, of a term 
  relating to disclosure met the requirements for implying a term in an agreement 
  on ordinary contract principles. </p>
<p>
  [71] I must now deal with whether the trial judge properly exercised his discretion 
  to award retroactive spousal and child support on the basis that it was &quot;fit 
  and just&quot; in the circumstances. </p>
<p>
  v. The Trial Judge's Award of Retroactive Support</p>
<p>
  [72] The decision to award retroactive support is one to be exercised sparingly. 
  In relation to child support the term retroactive may be somewhat of a misnomer 
  since the obligation to pay support arises immediately upon the birth of the 
  child and continues regardless of whether or when the payee spouse brings an 
  action for support: L.S. v. E.P. (1999), B.C.L.R. (3d) 254 (C.A.). In L.S., 
  supra, Rowles J.A. provides a very helpful summary of the criteria for making 
  or declining to make an award of retroactive support under the Divorce Act, 
  at paras. 66 and 67, as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> A review of the case law reveals that there are a number of 
  factors which have been regarded as significant in determining whether to order 
  or not to order retroactive child maintenance. Factors militating in favour 
  of ordering retroactive maintenance include: (1) the need on the part of the 
  child and a corresponding ability to pay on the part of the non-custodial parent; 
  (2) some blameworthy conduct on the part of the non-custodial parent such as 
  incomplete or misleading financial disclosure at the time of the original order; 
  (3) necessity on the part of the custodial parent to encroach on his or her 
  capital or incur debt to meet child rearing expenses; (4) an excuse for a delay 
  in bringing the application where the delay is significant; and (5) notice to 
  the non-custodial parent of an intention to pursue maintenance followed by negotiations 
  to that end.</p>
<p class="indent">Factors which have militated against ordering retroactive maintenance 
  include: (1) the order would cause an unreasonable or unfair burden to the non-custodial 
  parent, especially to the extent that such a burden would interfere with ongoing 
  support obligations; (2) the only purpose of the award would be to redistribute 
  capital or award spousal support in the guise of child support; and (3) a significant, 
  unexplained delay in bringing the application.</p>
<p>
  [73] The factors described by Rowles J.A. were made in the context of child 
  support but they are in the main also applicable to spousal support. I propose 
  to address the various factors below. Globally, these factors are aimed at discerning 
  the fairness of a retroactive award of support. Following this, I will consider 
  the appropriateness of the quantum of spousal and child support awarded. </p>
<p>
  (a) Need and a corresponding ability to pay</p>
<p>
  [74] In determining need, the court is to be guided by the principle that the 
  spouse receiving support is entitled to receive the support that would allow 
  her to maintain the standard of living to which she was accustomed at the time 
  cohabitation ceased. In addition, there is jurisprudence to the effect that 
  a spouse is entitled to an increase in the standard of living such as would 
  have occurred in the normal course of cohabitation: See MacDougall v. MacDougall 
  (1973), 11 R.F.L. 266 (Ont. Sup. Ct.) per Henry J. See also Linton v. Linton 
  (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.). At the same time the court must guard against 
  redistributing the payor's capital in the guise of support. </p>
<p>
  [75] The trial judge found that the respondent was unable to contribute in any 
  real way to her own support. The evidence supports the trial judge's conclusion 
  that the respondent's earning capacity was impaired by the marriage, her parenting 
  responsibilities and the breakdown of the marriage. Her ability to earn income 
  has been, and continues to be, affected by her parenting responsibilities while 
  the appellant's career and financial consequences have not been impaired. In 
  addition, I see no error in the trial judge's decision that the respondent was 
  entitled to support based on need. It is clear that the award is designed not 
  only to redress the economic consequences of the breakdown of the marriage, 
  but also to compensate the respondent for her efforts in assisting the appellant 
  to obtain the education that has enabled him to become the successful person 
  he is. Having regard to these considerations, the award of retroactive spousal 
  support is not made as a guise for redistribution of capital.</p>
<p>
  [76] In relation to child support, the trial judge was aware of the need to 
  consider the factor of redistribution of capital in relation to his award. He 
  quoted from the decision of Bastarache J. in Francis v. Baker, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 
  250 at para. 41, agreeing with the sentiment of Abella J.A., that courts should 
  not be too quick to find that the Guideline figures enter the realm of wealth 
  transfers.</p>
<p>
  [77] The purpose of child support, as stated by this court in Drygala v. Pauli 
  (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 711, is to assist the custodial parent in meeting the day-to-day 
  expenses of raising children. A party seeking retroactive child support must 
  provide evidence of need during the period in question: Drygala, supra, Brett 
  v. Brett (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 61 (C.A.); Hoar v. Hoar (1993), 45 R.F.L. (3d) 
  105 (Ont. C.A.). The respondent's evidence at trial relating to her financial 
  situation after the Minutes provided the evidentiary basis of need for herself 
  and the child. The objectives of the Guidelines include the establishment of 
  a fair standard of support for children which ensures they benefit from the 
  financial means of their parents and ensures consistent treatment of parents 
  and their children who are in similar circumstances. The facts demonstrate that 
  the appellant has ample ability to pay. I see no error in the trial judge's 
  decision to award retroactive child support in accordance with the Guidelines 
  once they came into effect. It is consistent with the governing principles and 
  can be justified on the evidence.</p>
<p>
  (b) Improper conduct by the payor spouse</p>
<p>
  [78] At the time the Minutes were signed in October of 1996 the appellant swore 
  that he did not anticipate any material changes in the information he had given. 
  This included the statement that the value of his options was unknown. The appellant 
  began to cash in some of his options the next day. About the time the Minutes 
  came into force in January of 1997 the appellant had exercised some $250,000 
  worth of options. In the circumstances, the appellant's statement that he did 
  not know the value of any of his options is of some concern. I have also held 
  that in this case the appellant had an implied duty to disclose material changes 
  of his circumstances. The appellant's failure to disclose the gains from his 
  options in 1996 and 1997 and his increase in salary and bonus breached this 
  duty and was therefore improper. </p>
<p>
  (c) Need to encroach on capital or incur debt</p>
<p>
  [79] The trial judge stated that the respondent's &quot;&#133; debt has increased 
  each year. She is 2 years in arrears with respect to taxes owing to Revenue 
  Canada, which is demanding payment, the property taxes on her home are in arrears, 
  her bank line of credit is near its limit, she has borrowed money from her aged 
  mother, her home is in need of substantial repair and she is in need of dental 
  care.&quot; The trial judge did not find that the debts were the result of irresponsibility 
  on the respondent's part. The debts are indicative of the respondent's need 
  for support for both herself and her child.</p>
<p>
  (d) Excuse for delay in bringing the application</p>
<p>
  [80] Here the delay was occasioned by the fact that the respondent was not aware 
  of the appellant's material changes in circumstances or its timing nor could 
  she have independently discovered this information. The respondent had no reason 
  to expect that the appellant would not comply with his obligation in paragraph 
  3 of the Minutes. She could not reasonably have been expected to request the 
  appellant's 1997 income tax return until May of 1998. </p>
<p>
  (e) Notice to the payor spouse of an intention to pursue support</p>
<p>
  [81] The appellant had notice of the respondent's intention to pursue child 
  support from the date that the request for the appellant's income tax returns 
  was made in August 1998. Since the earliest date when the respondent could reasonably 
  have been expected to ask for the appellant's income tax return was May of 1998 
  the request in August is within the ambit of reasonableness. </p>
<p>
  [82] The issue of retroactive spousal support was not pleaded and only arose 
  during the hearing of the application. Although no formal order amending the 
  Notice of Application was made, the trial judge heard full argument on the issue. 
  No prejudice would have been occasioned to the appellant if a formal amendment 
  to the pleadings had been made. It was not until the respondent had knowledge 
  of the appellant's income that she was in a position to request increased spousal 
  support. While there was some delay on the part of the respondent in requesting 
  increased spousal support once she became aware of the appellant's income, this 
  delay occasioned no prejudice. The major portion of the delay after the Minutes 
  were signed arose prior to the respondent becoming aware of the appellant's 
  circumstances and was due to his non-disclosure. </p>
<p>
  (f) Unreasonable burden on the payor spouse</p>
<p>
  [83] There is no evidence to suggest that the appellant's ability to make ongoing 
  support payments as they become due is prejudiced by the retroactive lump sum 
  awards of support.</p>
<p>
  [84] The appellant has not shown any palpable and overriding error in the trial 
  judge's findings nor has he shown any error in principle with respect to the 
  exercise of the trial judge's discretion to award retroactive child and spousal 
  support. </p>
<p>
  vi. Quantum of Support and Duration of Retroactive Support</p>
<p>
  [85] In relation to child support, the trial judge awarded retroactive support 
  for all of 1997 in accordance with the Guidelines. The appellant submits that 
  this was an error in principle as the Guidelines did not come into force until 
  May 1, 1997. The appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in principle 
  in awarding the Table amount in the Guidelines while maintaining payment by 
  the appellant of the child's private school fees under the Minutes. </p>
<p>
  [86] It may be helpful to review the proper approach to be used when a court 
  makes an award of child support under the Guidelines in respect of a parent 
  earning more than $150,000 a year. That approach is ably described by Laskin 
  J.A. in R. v. R. (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 656 at paras. 38 and 39 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Section 26.1(2) of the Divorce Act affirms that &quot;[t]he 
  guidelines shall be based on the principle that spouses have a joint financial 
  obligation to maintain the children of the marriage in accordance with their 
  relative abilities to contribute to the performance of that obligation&quot;.</p>
<p class="indent">Against that legislative regime, the Supreme Court's decision 
  in Francis v. Baker provides further guidance in determining how much high income 
  parents should pay in child support. Francis v. Baker established the following 
  general principles: </p>
<p class="indent15"> Trial judges have discretion either to increase or decrease 
  the table amount if they consider that amount inappropriate and instead to order 
  an amount that they consider appropriate.</p>
<p class="indent15">The table amount, however, is presumed to be the appropriate 
  amount. A parent seeking an order different from the table amount bears the 
  onus of rebutting the presumption in s. 3 of the Guidelines and must do so by 
  &quot;clear and compelling evidence&quot;. The sheer size of the table amount 
  is not by itself an &quot;articulable reason&quot; for departing from it.</p>
<p class="indent15">Although the considerations relevant to an appropriate child 
  support order will differ from case to case, the courts must at least have regard 
  to the objectives of the Divorce Act and the Guidelines, and to the factors 
  expressly listed in s. 4(b)(ii) of the Guidelines. The legislative objectives 
  are intended to ensure &quot;that a divorce will affect the children as little 
  as possible&quot; and the factors in s. 4(b)(ii) further that intent by emphasizing 
  &quot;the centrality of the actual situation of the children&quot;.</p>
<p class="indent15">Child support should meet a child's reasonable needs. For 
  children of wealthy parents, reasonable needs include reasonable discretionary 
  expenses. A paying parent who claims the table amount is inappropriate must, 
  therefore, demonstrate that budgeted child expenses are so high that they &quot;exceed 
  the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible&quot;, in 
  short that the budgeted expenses are unreasonable. Table amounts that so far 
  exceed a child's reasonable needs that they become a transfer of wealth between 
  the parents or spousal support under the guise of child support will be inappropriate.</p>
<p>
  [87] Although the trial judge was aware that the Guidelines did not come into 
  force until May of 1997, he chose to award support in accordance with the Guidelines 
  for all of 1997. While the trial judge may have been entitled to exercise his 
  discretion to award retroactive support in accordance with the Guidelines after 
  they came into force, in my opinion he erred in principle in extending the Guideline 
  amounts to the time period prior to the enactment of the legislation. This is 
  because prior to the Guidelines a narrower view of children's needs existed. 
  The payee spouse generally prepared and introduced into evidence a proposed 
  budget for the child's needs. The court considered and approved the various 
  budget items then awarded support based on the formula in Paras v. Paras, [1971] 
  1 O.R. 130 (C.A.). The practical effect of this approach was to place an onus 
  on the payee spouse to justify the budgeted amount for the child's needs. </p>
<p>
  [88] Under the Guidelines, children have a presumptive right to an amount of 
  support based on the payor spouse's income. Child-care budgets are unnecessary 
  in many cases and none was provided here. Beginning with Francis v. Baker, supra, 
  a more expansive approach to what was appropriate for the children of high income 
  earners was adopted. That approach was, in part, based on a recognition that 
  a certain level of discretionary spending for children of wealthy parents was 
  not inappropriate. This approach was followed in such cases as Simon v. Simon 
  (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 349, and in R. v. R., supra. Prior to the coming into force 
  of the guidelines the approach to awarding child support did not readily lend 
  itself to recognition of large discretionary amounts of spending for a child. 
  Having regard to the differences in the approach to awarding child support prior 
  to May of 1997, it was an error in principle for the trial judge to award the 
  Table amount prior to the coming into force of the Guidelines in May of 1997. 
  I agree with the appellant that the trial judge should not have awarded the 
  Guideline amount prior to May of 1997. Instead of the $104,613 he awarded for 
  1997, I would order that the appellant pay support based on the Table amount 
  in the Guidelines from the beginning of May 1997 or 8/12 of $104,613, which 
  is $69,740 rounded off. Prior to that I would not order any retroactive child 
  support be paid as no budget for the child was filed for the period from January 
  1 to April 30, 1997. I am of also of the opinion that this amount met the need 
  of the child in that the amount is fairly consistent with the $70,102.80 the 
  trial judge ordered the appellant to pay for 2001. It is also consistent with 
  the award made in R. v. R., supra, on a per child basis. </p>
<p>
  [89] I must now deal with the appellant's submission that the trial judge erred 
  in obligating him to pay the Table amount in addition to the payments for the 
  child's private school fees in the Minutes. In effect the appellant's submission 
  is that payment of the Table amount should be reduced by the amount of the private 
  school fees he is paying. </p>
<p>
  [90] Under s. 7 of the Guidelines, the court has discretion to order that an 
  additional amount of child support be paid to cover all or a portion of special 
  or extraordinary expenses for a child. Extraordinary expenses include extraordinary 
  expenses for primary and secondary school education or for any education programs 
  that meet the child's particular needs. The guiding principle in applying s. 
  7 is the sharing of the expense by the parties in proportion to their respective 
  incomes after deducting from the expense the contribution, if any, from the 
  child. The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to consider this principle 
  in ordering that he pay the private school fees under the Minutes in addition 
  to the Table amounts. </p>
<p>
  [91] I appreciate that when the trial judge ordered the appellant to pay the 
  Table amount under the Guidelines, consideration had to be given to his obligation 
  to pay private school expenses under the Minutes. The trial judge expressly 
  did so. He held that the appellant had not established on clear and compelling 
  evidence that deviation from the Guidelines was in the child's best interest. 
  The appellant has not shown that the trial judge erred in principle or that 
  the amount of child support is inappropriate in the sense that it exceeds the 
  generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible as required 
  in Francis v. Baker, supra, at para. 49. I would not give effect to the appellant's 
  submission that the amount of child support should be reduced by the payment 
  of the private school fees.</p>
<p>
  [92] Having regard to the trial judge's reasons respecting spousal support I 
  see no error in principle nor has the appellant shown that the award is clearly 
  wrong. </p>
<p>
  V. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [93] To summarize, in relation to the issue of misapprehension of the evidence, 
  I would hold that the trial judge's misapprehensions of the evidence did not 
  have a sufficiently decisive effect on his characterization of the effect of 
  the facts so as to justify appellate intervention. I would hold that the trial 
  judge did not err in (1) characterizing the appellant's exercise of options 
  as income; (2) not excluding the profit from the gain on the phantom stock from 
  income; (3) characterizing the option income and appellant's increase in salary 
  plus bonus as material changes pursuant to the Minutes; (4) characterizing the 
  appellant's non disclosure of the gains from his options and increase in salary 
  as the breach of an implicit obligation in the circumstances; (5) exercising 
  his discretion to award retroactive spousal and child support and (6) the quantum 
  of support he awarded, except with respect to the award of child support prior 
  to the coming into force of the Guidelines on May 1, 1997. For the reasons I 
  have given, I would allow the appeal in respect of the award of child support 
  prior to May 1, 1997 and instead of the amount of $104,613 awarded I would order 
  that the sum of $69,740 be paid. In all other respects I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  VI. COSTS</p>
<p>
  [94] Having regard to the fact that the respondent has been largely successful 
  on this appeal I would order that costs be paid to the respondent on a partial 
  indemnity basis fixed in the amount of $35,000 all inclusive.</p>

<hr style="height: 1px; color: #000000">
<a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> Because the agreement had not been incorporated 
into a support order, the Supreme Court held this was an initial application for 
support under s. 15 of the Divorce Act and rejected the importation of the &#147;material 
change &#147; test from s. 17 which deals with a variation of support. Instead, 
the Supreme Court held that, generally, a two-stage process applies when a party 
who has entered into a separation agreement seeks support under the Divorce Act. 
The first stage is the time of formation of the agreement and the second is the 
time of the application. In the first stage, the court should review the context 
and circumstances in which the agreement was negotiated and consider whether there 
is any reason to discount it such as whether one party took advantage of the other&#146;s 
vulnerability. Where the court is satisfied that the conditions under which the 
agreement was negotiated were satisfactory the court should consider whether the 
substance of the agreement is in substantial compliance with the overall objectives 
of the Divorce Act. If so, the court should afford the agreement great weight. 
In the second stage, the court should assess the extent to which enforcement of 
the agreement still reflects the original intention of the parties and the extent 
to which it is still in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Act.
