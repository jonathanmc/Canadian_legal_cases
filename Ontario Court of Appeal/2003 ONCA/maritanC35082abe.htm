<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The charge on reasonable doubt was appropriate and the appellant concedes 
  that the instruction was in accordance with R. v. Lifchus. Identification of 
  the appellant as the man Mr. Smith said he saw in June (as opposed to the timing) 
  was never in issue and the trial judge did not err in failing to caution the 
  jury about the weaknesses of eye-witness identification evidence. With respect 
  to the exhortation ground, the trial judge's instructions were proper and there 
  is no basis for thinking that the jury felt obliged to hurry up their verdict 
  and arrive at it before a 7:30 p.m. deadline. Accordingly, the appeal from conviction 
  is dismissed.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] With respect to sentence, we think the trial judge was entitled to give 
  less weight to the character evidence filed on behalf of the appellant given 
  that the appellant groomed the young complainant and was in a quasi-trust position 
  towards her. Having regard to the gravity and seriousness of the crime, we are 
  not persuaded that the trial judge erred in refusing to impose a conditional 
  sentence. The sentence imposed was fit and we see no basis for disturbing it. 
  The appeal from conviction and sentence is dismissed.</p>
