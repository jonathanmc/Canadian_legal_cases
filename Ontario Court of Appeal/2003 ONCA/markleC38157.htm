<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Sarah E. Pepall of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 5, 2002 (reported at (2002), 213 D.L.R. (4th) 362).<br>
</p>
<p>O'CONNOR A.C.J.O.:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] This appeal raises the issue whether an amending by-law enacted by the 
  appellant, the City of Toronto, lawfully entitles it to recover the internal 
  administrative expenses of operating a pension plan from the pension fund. The 
  pension plan was created by a 1956 by-law in order to provide pensions for City 
  employees. The 1956 by-law, and various successor by-laws, required the City 
  to pay the administrative expenses in issue.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] Certain members of the Board of Trustees of the pension plan (&quot;Trustees&quot;) 
  commenced an application in the Superior Court of Justice in which they asked 
  for the opinion, advice and direction of the court as to whether the amending 
  by-law, City of Toronto By-law 186-2001 (&quot;By-law 186&quot;), lawfully required 
  the Trustees to pay to the City the internal administrative costs from the pension 
  plan fund. In a decision reported at (2002), 213 D.L.R. (4th) 362, Pepall J. 
  ruled that By-law 186 was not lawful, finding inter alia that the pension plan 
  created a trust in favour of the employees, that the pension plan did not contain 
  a power of revocation, and that By-law 186 constituted a partial revocation 
  and a breach of the trust. For the reasons that follow, I agree with the conclusions 
  of the application judge and would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>FACTS<br>
</p>
<p>[3] In 1956, the Council of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (&quot;Metro 
  Council&quot;) enacted By-law 426 under the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto 
  Act, S.O. 1953, c. 73, as amended (&quot;Metro Act&quot;), to provide a pension 
  plan for its employees (&quot;Plan&quot;). The Plan was a contributory, defined 
  benefit plan. Members were required to contribute five per cent of their earnings 
  from each pay, while the employer contributed each year such amounts as were 
  required to ensure that the stipulated benefits would be provided. The defined 
  benefit was a percentage of the member's final earnings multiplied by his/her 
  years of service.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] Section 26 of By-law 426 vested the administration of the Plan in a three-member 
  Board of Trustees, who were appointed by Metro Council. The Trustees were responsible 
  for the receipt of all contributions to the Plan fund (&quot;Fund&quot;) and 
  for custody of the Fund. They were also given responsibility for the investment 
  of the Fund in securities eligible under the Trustee Act, Ontario, as revised 
  from time to time. Section 26 directed Metro Council to appoint a Retirement 
  Committee which was responsible for facilitating the collection of employee 
  contributions and the payment of benefits and for keeping records with respect 
  to Plan members. Relevant to the issues in this appeal, s. 26 stipulated that 
  the employer was to bear &quot;all expenses incurred by the Trustees and the 
  Retirement Committee.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Section 27 of By-law 426 gave the employer a general power to amend the 
  Plan and set out two restrictions on that power: i) the employer was not entitled 
  to amend the plan to recover any contributions made by it into the Fund; and 
  ii) the employer could not amend the plan to reduce accumulated benefits which 
  had accrued to the members.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] Since 1956, the Plan has been restated and continued on several occasions 
  under various successor by-laws. The relevant successor by-laws are discussed 
  below.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] Pursuant to a 1971 by-law, the Trustees were required to assume the responsibilities 
  of the Retirement Committee. This amending by-law continued the requirement 
  that all expenses incurred by the Trustees were to be borne by the employer.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] In 1981, Metro Council passed a by-law which provided that, subject to 
  the approval of the Trustees, certain identified expenses incurred by the Trustees, 
  including fees payable to advisors retained by the Trustees, were to be paid 
  from the Fund. The employer continued to be responsible to pay all expenses 
  not identified in the 1981 by-law. <br>
</p>
<p>[9] In 1992, Metro Council passed By-law 15-92, which is the by-law that currently 
  governs the Plan. The sections of By-law 15-92 that are relevant to the issues 
  in this appeal are s. 8 (payment of administrative expenses) and s. 45 (power 
  of amendment). <br>
</p>
<p>[10] Section 8 required Metro staff to provide certain administrative services 
  to the Plan and continued the provision that, subject to the approval of the 
  Trustees, certain identified expenses would be paid from the Fund with the employer 
  being responsible to pay the remaining expenses. Section 8 of By-law 15-92 reads 
  as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">8. (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the Metropolitan 
  Treasurer shall, through the facilities of the Metropolitan Treasury Department, 
  provide all administrative staff and services required for the efficient operation 
  of the Plan.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The Metropolitan Clerk shall, through the facilities 
  of the Metropolitan Clerk's Department, record the proceedings of the Board 
  of Trustees and execute such secretarial instructions as may be received from 
  the Board of Trustees.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The Metropolitan Treasurer and the Metropolitan 
  Auditor shall be the Treasurer and the Auditor respectively of the fund and 
  they shall report annually to the Board of Trustees and the Metropolitan Corporation. 
  <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Subject to the approval of the Board of Trustees, 
  the following costs of administering the Plan shall be paid from the fund:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent15">(a) fees payable to the actuary, medical practitioners, custodians 
  and advisers retained by the Board of Trustees;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent15">(b) direct costs arising out of the administration of 
  the fund; and<br>
</p>
<p class="indent15">(c) expenses actually incurred by a Trustee in the capacity 
  as such, provided that<br>
</p>
<p class="indent20">(i) the expenses shall be in accordance with the by-law of 
  the Council respecting the expenses of its members; and<br>
</p>
<p class="indent20">(ii) the expenses of the Metropolitan Chairman and any 
  Trustee who is a member of the Council shall not be paid from the fund.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(5) The employers shall pay all costs in connection 
  with the Plan not provided for in subsection (4), including the remuneration 
  of the chairman of the Board of Trustees and the costs associated with subsections 
  (1) to (3) [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>[11] Section 45 of By-law 15-92 confers a power to amend the Plan on the employer 
  which is essentially the same as the amending power found in the by-law that 
  originally established the Plan. In enacting By-law 186, the by-law in issue 
  in this appeal, the City of Toronto purported to act pursuant to the power of 
  amendment found in s. 45. That section reads as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">45. (1) The principal employer reserves the right to 
  amend the Plan provided that no such amendment shall:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent15">(a) entitle any employer to recover any contribution made 
  by it into the fund; or<br>
</p>
<p class="indent15">(b) reduce the accumulated benefits which have accrued 
  in favour of the members under the Plan by reason of their service to the employer 
  up to the date of such amendment, and with respect to which the contributions 
  to the fund required under the Plan have already been made, except upon the 
  termination of the Plan when as a result of insufficient funds a reduction in 
  benefits is authorized under the PBA, [Pension Benefits Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  P. 8 (&quot;PBA&quot;)].</p>
<p>[12] By-law 15-92 also provides that on termination of the Plan, surplus is 
  to be paid to the employer to liquidate any unfunded liability and/or expense 
  deficiency. Any remaining surplus is to be distributed equally between employees 
  and pensioners on the one hand and the employer on the other. <br>
</p>
<p>[13] In 1997, the City of Toronto was created by the City of Toronto Act, 1997 
  (No. 2), S.O. 1997, c. 26 (&quot;City of Toronto Act&quot;). This Act replaced 
  the Metro Act under which the Plan had been established. Section 3(2) of the 
  City of Toronto Act protects the pension rights and benefits of employees of 
  the former municipality and s. 3(5) preserves the City's right to make changes 
  with respect to a pension plan, including changes affecting the rights of employees 
  of the former municipality, &quot;by agreement or as otherwise allowed by law.&quot; 
  Section 4 permits City Council to amend a pension by-law passed under the Metro 
  Act. <br>
</p>
<p>[14] By a resolution passed in April 1999, City Council recommended that the 
  cost of administrative services provided by City staff to five pension plans, 
  including the Plan, should be recovered from the pension plan funds rather than 
  be paid for by the City. The cost of providing these administrative services 
  to the five plans was calculated at $500,000. The portion of these charges allocated 
  by the City to the Plan was $181,333.40.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] On March 8, 2001, City Council passed By-law 186 which purports to amend 
  the Plan by directing that the City provide all administrative staff and services 
  for the Plan and that the City shall be entitled to recover the costs of providing 
  such staff and services from the Plan. The amendment is mandatory and does not 
  allow for the exercise of any discretion by the Trustees regarding the payment 
  of the costs of the administrative staff and services provided by the City. 
  As a result of the amendment, s. 8 of By-law 15-92 now reads in part as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">8. (1) The City shall provide all administrative staff 
  and services required for the efficient operation of the Plan.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(3.1) The City shall be entitled to recover from the 
  Plan in accordance with clause (4)(b) the costs of providing the staff and services 
  described in subsections (1) to (3).<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(5) The employers shall pay all costs in connection 
  with the Plan not provided for in subsection (4), including the remuneration 
  of the chairman of the Board of Trustees [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>[16] The above amendment was made retroactive to January 1, 1999, thereby purporting 
  to entitle the City to recover from the Plan the internal administrative costs 
  incurred during the previous twenty-six months.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] As of December 31, 2000, the Fund had an actuarial surplus<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  of $291,625,000. Also as of that date, the Plan covered 75 active members and 
  3,829 inactive members and beneficiaries, most of whom were retirees or their 
  spouses. The Plan only applies to City employees hired before July 1, 1968. 
  City employees hired after that date are covered by a different pension plan 
  established under the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. O. 38. <br>
</p>
<p>[18] In a Notice of Application dated September 13, 2001, the Trustees requested 
  the opinion, advice and direction of the Superior Court of Justice on the following 
  issues:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(i) Does the resolution of the City of Toronto Council 
  of April, 1999 and By-law 186-2001 subsequently enacted on March 8, 2001, lawfully 
  require the Plan's Board of Trustees to pay the City of Toronto's internal costs 
  for pension plan administration from the Fund?</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) If the answer to question (i) is yes, then can 
  the 2001 amendment lawfully come into effect retroactively on January 1, 1999 
  as provided in By-law 186-2001?</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) In light of the opinion and advice of the court 
  in respect of the matters set out above, may the Trustees lawfully authorize 
  the payments to the City required pursuant to the 2001 amendment?</p>
<p>ISSUES</p>
<p>[19] This appeal requires the court to decide whether the application judge 
  erred in concluding that: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">a) the Fund is held in trust for the employees; </p>
<p class="indent">b) the City does not have the power to revoke the trust; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">c) By-law 186 constitutes a partial revocation and a 
  breach of trust.<br>
</p>
<p>[20] In light of my views on the trust issues, it will be unnecessary to deal 
  with the respondent Trustees' alternative submission that the April 1999 Resolution 
  and By-law 186 constitute a breach of contract. It will also be unnecessary 
  to consider the Trustees' argument that the City, as agent of the Trustees, 
  breached the fiduciary duties imposed by s. 22 of the PBA.</p>
<p>ANALYSIS</p>
<p>Issue #1 - Is there a trust?<br>
</p>
<p>[21] I agree with the application judge that By-law 426, enacted in 1956, created 
  a trust in favour of the employees. In reaching this conclusion, the application 
  judge set out the proper legal principles (at p. 376) and then correctly concluded, 
  in my view, that By-law 426 was a declaration of trust and that there was a 
  conveyance of property to the Trustees so that the trust was properly constituted 
  (at pp. 377-8).<br>
</p>
<p>[22] Moreover, I agree with the application judge that the Fund that is impressed 
  with a trust includes all of the funds held by the Trustees, that is, both the 
  contributions made by the respective parties as well as the actuarial surplus. 
  Pension trusts, like the one created by By-law 426, are not mere purpose trusts; 
  rather they are classic or true trusts to which the equitable principles of 
  trust law apply: Schmidt v. Air Products of Canada, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 611, 115 
  D.L.R. (4th) 631 at 655-6 D.L.R. That being the case, absent specific wording 
  to the contrary, all of the funds in the care of the Trustees are subject to 
  a trust in favour of the beneficiaries. When there is no language in the document(s) 
  that create a pension trust to indicate an intention that an actuarial surplus 
  in an ongoing Plan is not to be held for the beneficiaries, trust law principles 
  dictate that the ongoing actuarial surplus will be part of the trust fund: Ibid. 
  at pp. 656-7 D.L.R.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] The 1956 by-law that created the pension plan defined the Fund held by 
  the Trustees as meaning &quot;the monies, securities, negotiable instruments 
  and other properties in the custody of the Trustees for the carrying out of 
  the purposes of the Plan&quot;. There is nothing in this language or elsewhere 
  in the 1956 by-law to indicate that an actuarial surplus is not to form part 
  of the trust fund. <br>
</p>
<p>[24] Accordingly, the actuarial surplus in this case constitutes part of the 
  trust fund held for the employees. The fact that the employees' entitlement 
  to those funds may not crystallize until the Plan is terminated, at which point 
  an actuarial surplus (if there is one) becomes an actual surplus, does not change 
  the fact that the actuarial surplus is part of the trust fund and that as such 
  it may only be dealt with during the life of the trust in a manner that is consistent 
  with the principles of trust law or relevant statutory provisions.<br>
</p>
<p>[25] The conclusion that trust principles apply to the trust in this case is 
  not altered by the fact that the Plan was created by a municipal by-law. Where 
  the language of a statute or a by-law creating a pension plan indicates an intention 
  to create a trust in favour of the employees, the courts will respect that intention 
  in the same way as if the plan was created by private instrument. See for example, 
  C.U.P.E. v. Ontario Hydro (1989), 68 O.R. (2d) 620 at 634 (C.A.), where this 
  court stated that assets of a pension plan established pursuant to a provincial 
  statute and regulation are trust assets.<br>
</p>
<p>Issue #2 - Does the City have a power of revocation?<br>
</p>
<p>[26] The City argues that if the Fund is impressed with a trust, it has the 
  power to revoke the trust under which the Fund is held and that the enactment 
  of By-law 186 was a proper exercise of that power. The City takes the position 
  that the power of revocation may be found in two sources: in the Plan itself 
  as well as in certain statutory provisions. I will deal with each of these below.<br>
</p>
<p>[27] In Schmidt, supra at p. 657 D.L.R., the Supreme Court of Canada held:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">When a pension fund is impressed with a trust, that 
  trust is subject to all applicable trust law principles. The significance of 
  this for the present appeals is twofold. Firstly, the employer will not be able 
  to claim entitlement to funds subject to a trust unless the terms of the trust 
  make the employer a beneficiary, or unless the employer reserved a power of 
  revocation of the trust at the time the trust was originally created. Secondly, 
  if the objects of the trust have been satisfied but assets remain in the trust, 
  those funds may be subject to a resulting trust [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>[28] The court in Schmidt, supra, accepted that a settlor of a trust may reserve 
  a power of revocation. However, the court went on to hold at pp. 659-60 D.L.R. 
  that because a power of revocation is inconsistent with the fundamental concept 
  of a trust, such a power may only be sustained if that power is clearly and 
  unequivocally reserved to the settlor at the time the trust is created. An amending 
  power, even a very broadly worded one, does not bring with it the power to revoke. 
  Amendment and revocation are two different concepts. As Cory J. said at p. 659 
  D.L.R., &quot;amendment means change, not cancellation, which the word 'revocation' 
  connotes&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[29] The City submits that s. 45 of By-law 15-92, set out at paragraph 11 above, 
  contains a power of revocation. I disagree. In my view, the section confers 
  a power of amendment only, nothing more. Section 45 uses the language of amendment, 
  not revocation, giving the City the &quot;right to amend&quot;, not to revoke. 
  Section 45 does not contain the type of clear and unequivocal language that 
  is required to reserve a right of revocation to the settlor. Accordingly, I 
  am satisfied that the Plan does not confer a power of revocation on the City. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[30] The City also argues that a power to revoke may be found in ss. 3 and 
  4 of the City of Toronto Act. The pertinent provisions of this Act provide:</p>
<p class="indent">3. (5) This section does not affect any power that the 
  city or any of its local boards may have to make changes with respect to a pension 
  or benefit plan or fund, including changes affecting the rights of persons listed 
  in subsection (2), by agreement or as otherwise allowed by law. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">4. (1) The council may, by by-law, amend a by-law passed 
  under clause 24 (3) (b) of the Metro Act, as it read on December 31, 1997, or 
  under a predecessor of that clause. <br>
  (2) A by-law under subsection (1) requires an affirmative vote of two-thirds 
  of the members of council who are present and voting.<br>
</p>
<p>[31] The thrust of the City's argument is that the power to amend by-laws found 
  in each of these sections gives municipalities the power to revoke pension trusts 
  created in favour of their employees. I do not accept this argument for two 
  reasons. <br>
</p>
<p>[32] First, such an interpretation requires the court to construe a statutory 
  power of amendment as a power of revocation, which would be inconsistent with 
  the common law position established by Schmidt that an amending power does not 
  bring with it the power to revoke a trust. It is a settled principle of statutory 
  interpretation that where the legislature intends to change the common law, 
  it must do so expressly and in clear and unequivocal terms. See for e.g. McIntyre 
  Estate v. A.G. (Ontario) (2002), 218 D.L.R. (4th) 193 (Ont. C.A.) at 209-210. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[33] Sections 3 and 4 of the City of Toronto Act do not indicate an intention 
  to confer a power of revocation as opposed to a mere power of amendment. There 
  is no reason why these sections should not be interpreted in a manner consistent 
  with the common law as conferring a power of amendment and nothing more. <br>
</p>
<p>[34] The second reason I do not accept that these sections confer a power of 
  revocation arises from my reading of s. 3 of that Act. Section 3(2) of the City 
  of Toronto Act expressly preserves all pension rights and benefits of employees 
  that existed prior to the enactment of this Act. Moreover, the statutory amendment 
  power recognized in s. 3(5) contains the explicit limitation that changes to 
  a pension or benefit plan, including changes affecting the rights of pension 
  plan members or beneficiaries, are limited to changes that are &quot;otherwise 
  allowed by law&quot;. Section 3(5) thus requires that the amendment power be 
  read in a manner that is consistent with common law trust principles.<br>
</p>
<p>[35] Another statutory provision that the City relies on as authorizing the 
  proposed amendment to the Plan found in By-law 186 is s. 28(g) of the Interpretation 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.11. This provision states:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">28. In every Act, unless the contrary intention appears, 
  &#133;<br>
  (g) where power is conferred to make by-laws, regulations, rules or orders, 
  it includes power to alter or revoke the same from time to time and make others;</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, s. 28(g) does not assist the City. It confirms 
  a power to revoke a by-law, but does not authorize the revocation of a trust 
  created by a by-law. <br>
</p>
<p>[36] The City also argues that the PBA permits amendments to pension plans, 
  including retroactive amendments, and that the PBA provides for the payment 
  of administrative fees out of plan funds. In this regard, the City points to 
  s. 10(1), paragraph 9 of the PBA, which provides:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">10. (1) The documents that create and support a pension 
  plan shall set out the following information:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">9. The mechanism for payment of the cost of administration 
  of the pension plan and the pension fund.<br>
</p>
<p>[37] This provision simply requires that the pension plan documents set out 
  a description of the mechanism for paying administrative expenses. The City 
  has not pointed to any authority in the PBA that would authorize it to revoke 
  a pension plan trust in favour of the employee beneficiaries.<br>
</p>
<p>[38] In summary, I agree with the application judge that neither the Plan itself 
  nor the statutes relied on by the City confer a power of revocation on the City.<br>
</p>
<p>Issue #3 - Does By-law 186 constitute a partial revocation and a breach of 
  trust?<br>
</p>
<p>[39] A central element of the creation of a trust is the transfer of property. 
  The essence of a revocation<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> is removal 
  of property or assets from the trust fund. Absent a power of revocation, the 
  transfer of property to a trust is absolute; the settlor disposes of the property 
  irrevocably to the trustees in the same way that one makes an outright gift. 
  Once the trust assets are received by the trustee they are held for the benefit 
  of the beneficiaries and the settlor loses all rights to control the property.<br>
</p>
<p>[40] In Schmidt, supra at pp. 658-59, Cory J. explained the irrevocable nature 
  of a trust as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view the nature and purpose of the trust as it 
  has evolved in Canada is consistent with a more restrictive interpretation as 
  to when the trust instrument will permit a unilateral revocation of the trust. 
  One of the most fundamental characteristics of a trust is that it involves a 
  transfer of property. In the words of D.W.M. Waters, Law of Trusts in Canada, 
  [2nd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1994)] at p. 2291:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;the trust is a mode of disposition, and once the 
  instrument of creation of the trust has taken effect or a verbal declaration 
  has been made of immediate disposition on trust, the settlor has alienated the 
  property as much as if he had given it to the beneficiaries by an out-and-out 
  gift. This almost self-evident proposition has to be reiterated because it is 
  sometimes said that the trust is a mode of &quot;restricted transfer&quot;. 
  So indeed it is, but the restriction does not mean that by employing the trust 
  the settlor inherently retains a right or power to intervene once the trust 
  has taken effect, whether to set the trust aside, change the beneficiaries, 
  name other beneficiaries, take back part of the trust property, or do anything 
  else to amend or change the trust. By restriction is meant that he has transferred 
  the property but subject to restrictions upon who is to enjoy and to what degree. 
  The mode of future enjoyment is regulated in the act of transferring, but the 
  transfer remains a true transfer.<br>
</p>
<p>[41] Not only does the settlor of an irrevocable trust alienate the property 
  held in the trust fund, he or she also has no authority to control the trustees 
  in exercising their discretion as fiduciaries of the trust. The control of the 
  trust property passes to the trustees and any attempts by the settlor to indirectly 
  exercise control through mandatory directions to the trustees other than in 
  the terms creating the trust would constitute an impermissible fetter on the 
  trustees' discretion: see Re Blow (1977), 18 O.R. (2d) 516 (H.C.J.).<br>
</p>
<p>[42] By-law 186 purports to amend By-law 15-92 by requiring that the City be 
  entitled to recover its internal costs for pension plan administration from 
  the Fund. The by-law imposes this requirement both retroactively for services 
  provided during the period from January 1, 1999 to the date of the by-law and 
  prospectively for services provided in the future. The issue then is whether 
  the imposition of either of these requirements is permitted by the power of 
  amendment found in s. 45 of By-law 15-92. For clarity, it is helpful to deal 
  with the retrospective and prospective requirements separately. <br>
</p>
<p>[43] As to the retrospective aspects, I note that City Council passed a resolution 
  on April 1, 1999 to the same effect as By-law 186 which was not passed until 
  March 8, 2001. The resolution was an indication of intention. It did not amend 
  By-law 15-92. Under s. 8 of By-law 15-92, the City is required to provide certain 
  administrative services without charge. It did so during the period before the 
  enactment of By-law 186 and the attempt in By-law 186 to retroactively require 
  the Plan to pay for these services from trust funds constitutes a partial revocation 
  of trust. The funds that would be used to pay the City are part of the trust 
  fund held for the employees. The requirement to pay for services already performed, 
  where the terms of the Plan required the City to bear these expenses, is inconsistent 
  with the terms of the trust and, therefore, beyond the authority of the City. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[44] Prospectively, the effect of By-law 186 will require the Trustees to pay 
  trust monies towards administrative services that the City will provide for 
  the Plan. While it is correct that the Plan will receive a benefit in exchange 
  for the payments to the City, the effect of the amendment if permitted to proceed, 
  is nonetheless to allow the City to exercise control over the trust fund that 
  has been transferred irrevocably to the Trustees and that is subject to their 
  exclusive control. Whether one characterizes this effect as an improper attempt 
  to fetter the discretion of trustees as it relates to trust property, or as 
  a partial revocation of trust, the requirement in the by-law is inconsistent 
  with the fundamental nature of the trust and for that reason is invalid. The 
  City cannot dictate to the Trustees the manner in which they are to use trust 
  funds, absent a specific power to do so being reserved at the time the trust 
  was created.<br>
</p>
<p>[45] It is interesting to contrast the approach that the City adopted in enacting 
  By-law 186 with that used in both the 1981 and the 1992 by-laws. Prior to 1981, 
  the Plan provided that the employer was to bear all of the administrative expenses 
  of the plan. Section 2 of the 1981 by-law provided that subject to the approval 
  of the Trustees, certain identified costs shall be paid from the Fund. The by-law 
  then set out the identified costs which were to be paid from the Fund, but importantly 
  only with the approval of the Trustees. The 1992 by-law adopted the same approach. 
  In neither case did the earlier by-laws seek to mandate payment or to fetter 
  the discretion of the Trustees; rather, payments were expressly made subject 
  to the approval of the Trustees. Framed in this fashion, the 1981 and the 1992 
  by-laws were neither a partial revocation of trust, nor did they constitute 
  an improper fettering of the discretion of the trustees. <br>
</p>
<p>[46] Two arguments of the City as to why By-law 186 does not constitute a revocation 
  of trust warrant further comment. First, relying on the Supreme Court of Canada's 
  decision in Schmidt, the City argues that the impugned by-law is tantamount 
  to a contribution holiday from the City's obligations to provide administrative 
  expenses without charge and is, therefore, permissible. I disagree. In Schmidt, 
  the Supreme Court permitted the contribution holiday because of the specific 
  wording used in the employer contribution clause in the pension plan under review. 
  That language, the court held, permitted a holiday (at p. 672 D.L.R.). In the 
  present case, there is nothing in the language of s. 8 of By-law 15-92, the 
  clause requiring the City to provide administrative services free of charge, 
  that permits a contribution holiday. <br>
</p>
<p>[47] Moreover, the question that was raised in the application in this case 
  was not whether the City can amend the plan to discontinue providing administrative 
  services free of charge (arguably a contribution holiday), but whether the resolution 
  of April 1999 or By-law 186 lawfully required the Trustees to pay out of the 
  Fund the City's internal costs of administering the Plan. It is the requirement 
  in the by-law compelling payment from the trust fund that intrudes upon the 
  principles of trust law. <br>
</p>
<p>[48] The City also argues that By-law 186 is authorized by s. 23.1 of the Trustee 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.23, which provides:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">23.1 A trustee who is of the opinion that an expense 
  would be properly incurred in carrying out the trust may,<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) pay the expense directly from the trust property; 
  or<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(b) pay the expense personally and recover a corresponding 
  amount from the trust property.<br>
</p>
<p>[49] The City contends that this provision allows for payment of administrative 
  expenses out of a trust and that hence By-law 186 is not a revocation of trust 
  property. I do not agree. Section 23.1 only refers to the authority of a trustee 
  to pay expenses from trust property. It does not permit a non-trustee to direct 
  the payment of trust funds and thus does not assist the City. </p>
<p>DISPOSITION<br>
</p>
<p>[50] For the above reasons, I agree with the application judge's conclusion 
  that the Fund is impressed with a trust. I also agree that the City does not 
  have a power to revoke the trust, either in the terms of the by-law that created 
  the trust or in the statutes relied on by the City. Finally, I conclude that 
  the retrospective effect of By-law 186 constitutes a partial revocation and 
  a breach of trust because, contrary to the terms of the trust requiring the 
  employer to pay for internal administrative expenses, the amendment requires 
  the withdrawal of trust monies from the Fund to pay these expenses. Prospectively, 
  By-law 186 is an improper attempt to fetter the discretion of trustees as it 
  relates to trust property or an unlawful attempt to permit the City to withdraw 
  trust assets where it is not a beneficiary of the trust and does not have a 
  power of revocation. <br>
</p>
<p>[51] Accordingly, I agree with the disposition of the application judge and 
  would dismiss the appeal. On consent, I would make no order as to costs.</p>
