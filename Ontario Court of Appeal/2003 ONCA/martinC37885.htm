<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This matter arises from a series of commercial transactions between the 
  appellant, the corporations that he controlled, and Nigel Stephen Axton. Axton, 
  a disbarred lawyer, was a client of the respondent law firm, Farano, Green. 
  Goldfarb is a practising lawyer with Farano, Green. Goldfarb and other members 
  of Farano, Green knew that Axton had been convicted of, and incarcerated for, 
  numerous counts of fraud. Axton referred the appellant, as a client, to Goldfarb. 
  Goldfarb acted for the appellant in numerous transactions involving Axton and 
  his associates in the period beginning July 28, 1988 and ending in the fall 
  of 1989. </p>
<p>
  [2] In a prior trial in this matter, the appellant was awarded damages as against 
  the respondents Goldfarb and Farano, Green (&quot;the respondents&quot;) for 
  losses suffered due to a breach of fiduciary duty owed to him by the respondents. 
  The trial judge concluded that the respondents were responsible for Axton's 
  conduct because they had concealed Axton's identity and background from the 
  appellant. The appellant was awarded $5.95 million in damages, plus pre-judgment 
  interest. </p>
<p>
  [3] The respondents appealed the damages portion of the judgment. This court 
  decided three issues in the appeal. The first related to establishing a causal 
  connection between Goldfarb's breach of fiduciary duty and damages suffered 
  because of frauds perpetrated by Axton and his associates. The second addressed 
  the failure of the trial judge to distinguish losses suffered by the appellant 
  personally from those suffered by the corporations that he controlled. The third 
  related to the lack of cogent evidence on the record to support the damages 
  award.</p>
<p>
  [4] In the result, this court directed that a new trial be held limited to an 
  assessment of the damages arising out of the personal losses sustained by the 
  appellant following a breach of fiduciary duty owed to him by the respondents. 
  Specifically, paragraph 2 of the order of August 26, 1998 directed: </p>
<p class="indent">
  THIS COURT FURTHER DOTH ORDER that the assessment of damages to the Respondent 
  personally be remitted back to the Trial Judge to determine the proper award 
  for damages. </p>
<p>
  [5] The new trial was conducted over four days. For written reasons given, the 
  trial judge dismissed each of the appellant's damage claims on one or more of 
  the following bases: inadequate evidence was called to establish the loss; the 
  damages suffered were not a direct personal loss; or, the appellant had failed 
  to establish a causal connection between his loss and the breach of fiduciary 
  duty. Costs were awarded against the appellant. </p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant's primary ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in 
  requiring that the personal losses be direct. This ground is addressed below. 
  The other errors alleged in this appeal are all based on the notion that the 
  trial judge failed in his obligation to assess damages because he either misunderstood 
  that obligation or failed to appreciate the difficulties that the appellant 
  had in proving his case. There is no substance to this submission. The trial 
  judge was fully aware of the task he faced and of the circumstances that surrounded 
  the production of evidence to support and quantify the appellant's damage claims. 
  We observe, in this regard, that the appellant made no attempt before us to 
  quantify the damages sought or even to suggest a range within which they could 
  be assessed, nor did he identify any particular pieces of evidence that would 
  enable this court to determine the losses. </p>
<p>
  [7] With the exception of the costs award against the appellant, we see no error 
  in the trial judge's analysis or conclusions.</p>
<p>
  [8] In relation to the appellant's personally owned properties, The Birches 
  and the Andover condominium, the trial judge was fully justified in concluding, 
  in respect to the former: </p>
<p class="indent">
  No evidence was adduced on this assessment as to the disposition of the matter 
  or the ultimate distribution of the proceeds. No evidence was called as to what 
  happened to the equity that had been paid into court and without evidence that 
  it was, in fact, paid out to Tonafin, Martin is unable to establish a loss in 
  respect of this property that is causally connected to the breach by Goldfarb.</p>
<p>
  In respect of the latter, the trial judge was justified in concluding that &quot;[b]ecause 
  no causal connection has been established between Martin's bankruptcy and Goldfarb's 
  breach of duty, this claim must fail as well.&quot; Damages cannot be awarded 
  absent evidence of a causal connection. </p>
<p>
  [9] In relation to the properties that had belonged to the appellant's late 
  mother, the trial judge correctly concluded that such losses are not recoverable 
  by the appellant. If losses were suffered on such properties and they could 
  be proven to be causally connected to the breach of duty, the resulting damages 
  would be those of the appellant's mother. Arguably, the appellant could claim 
  such damages as sole heir to his mother's estate although the prior direction 
  of this court limiting recovery to personal losses may preclude such a claim. 
  That matter, however, need not be decided as damages are not recoverable in 
  any event. Section 38(1) of the Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.T.23, provides that 
  a right of action is reposed only in the executor or administrator of an estate 
  and s. 38(3) operates to bar such an action if it is brought more than two years 
  after the death of the deceased. The fact that the within action was commenced 
  in 1990 and therefore within the two year period is of no assistance because 
  this action was not brought by the executor or administrator of the appellant's 
  mother's estate. </p>
<p>
  [10] In relation to the Perkins mortgage claim, the trial judge was fully justified 
  in finding that the appellant suffered no personal loss. The appellant has never 
  been called upon to repay the money or to reduce the indebtedness of the Royal 
  Bank to whom the money should have gone in the first place. As the trial judge 
  noted, if anyone suffered a loss in this respect, it was either Perkins as the 
  person who had advanced the funds or Newmarket Golf &amp; Country Club Ltd., 
  on whose property the mortgage had been placed to secure the loan from Perkins. 
  </p>
<p>
  [11] The trial judge also correctly concluded that the appellant was not entitled 
  to damages for loss of salary by the appellant's wife. Losses to one's spouse 
  cannot be said to be personal. For the same reason, the appellant is not entitled 
  to reimbursement for business expenses that had no personal component to them. 
  </p>
<p>
  [12] The appellant also claimed damages for loss of management fee to Martinvale 
  Estates Limited. As the trial judge ruled, &quot;If anything, this claim is 
  in the nature of a derivative claim, much like a shareholder, who is claiming 
  an indirect loss as a result of a wrong done to Martinvale Estates Limited&quot;. 
  The appellant's income loss claims in this regard are derivative in nature; 
  they are not personal losses. Allowing a claim for income loss in such circumstances 
  would lead to problems of double recovery and, in any event, is precluded by 
  the terms of the order of this court that restricts damages to those suffered 
  by the appellant personally.</p>
<p>
  [13] At the hearing of this appeal, the appellant abandoned his claim in relation 
  to TLC St. Petersberg Inc.</p>
<p>
  [14] With respect to the general damages claim, although the evidence demonstrates 
  that the appellant suffered loss of reputation, humiliation and disgrace that 
  would justify an award for general damages, on the evidence before him, the 
  trial judge was fully justified in concluding that the appellant failed to prove 
  that the bankruptcy was attributable to Goldfarb's breach of duty and Axton 
  transactions post-July 28, 1988.</p>
<p>
  [15] In arriving at our conclusion we are conscious of the fact that this court, 
  in ordering the new trial on the nature and quantum of personal damages, expressed 
  the opinion that &quot;evidence to support a personal claim is available&quot;. 
  Unfortunately, in the course of the new trial, the appellant was unable to establish 
  his claims. In our view, the trial judge rightly concluded that the evidence 
  was insufficient to support the appellant's claims.</p>
<p>
  [16] While a trial judge is to be afforded much deference in the matter of costs 
  awards, we are of the view that he erred in principle in awarding the respondents 
  costs of the damages trial. Although the appellant failed to establish his damages 
  claims, there remains an undisturbed finding of liability on the part of the 
  respondents for an extremely serious breach of fiduciary duty by professionals. 
  In light of that finding and the direction of this court that there be a new 
  trial on the matter of damages, we are of the view that he should not suffer 
  costs as a result of so doing. In the circumstances, we think that the proper 
  disposition is to order that there be no costs below. </p>
<p>
  The Cross-Appeal </p>
<p>
  [17] At the hearing of this matter, the appellants by cross-appeal, Goldfarb 
  and Farano Green, abandoned their cross-appeal in respect of the costs award 
  below.</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [18] Accordingly, leave to appeal costs is granted, this appeal is allowed in 
  part and paragraph 2 of the Order of January 3, 2002, is set aside. The cross-appeal 
  is dismissed. Because success on the appeal is divided, there shall be no order 
  respecting costs of the appeal.</p>
