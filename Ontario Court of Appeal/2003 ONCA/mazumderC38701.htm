<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally June 18, 2003</p>
<p>[1] In our view it is not necessary to decide the duty of care question.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] We think the motions judge was correct in deciding that there was nothing 
  before him to show that the respondent had any information that would have generated 
  evidence that would have exculpated the appellant. The respondent traced one 
  call in the 10:20 time frame on September 17, 1996 from several that might have 
  been the harassing call about which the respondent was notified by the police. 
  Even if the failure to run a Line 115 report on another call in this time frame 
  could be said to be a breach of a standard of care (which is debatable), there 
  is no showing that this report would have helped the appellant at all.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs fixed at $3,000.<br>
