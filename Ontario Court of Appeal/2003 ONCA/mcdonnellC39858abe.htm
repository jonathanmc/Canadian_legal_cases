<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Counsel for the appellant acknowledges that the sentence imposed on the 
  appellant was fit at the time of its imposition. In our view, the further evidence 
  filed by the appellant does not provide a basis for intervention by this court. 
  It is clear from that further evidence that the appellant can serve his sentence 
  without any impairment of his medical condition and treatment. Leave to appeal 
  against sentence is granted, but the appeal against sentence is dismissed. </p>
