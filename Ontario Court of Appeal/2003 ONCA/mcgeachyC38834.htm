<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree with the appellant that under the Supreme Court of Canada's test 
  in Miglin, and given the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the signing 
  of the agreement, there is no basis for requiring the appellant to pay spousal 
  support. </p>
<p> [2] We see no reason to discount the agreement, in view of the following: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the respondent had independent legal advice;</li>
  <li>she was aware of her right to seek spousal support;</li>
  <li>she provided a full and final release of that support; and</li>
  <li>the original agreement was, at the time, in general compliance with the 
    objectives of the Divorce Act.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [3] In our view, the agreement remains in compliance with the objectives under 
  the Act, and we are of the view that there has been no significant change in 
  the parties' circumstances from what could reasonably have been anticipated 
  at the time they negotiated the agreement.</p>
<p>
  [4] For these reasons, the order of Stong J. for spousal support is set aside, 
  and the funds paid into court pursuant to the order of Charron J.A. are to be 
  paid out of court to the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [5] In addition, an order will go requiring the respondent to pay back the spousal 
  support that has been paid to her pursuant to the order of Stong J., without 
  interest. </p>
<p>
  [6] In all of the circumstances, and in view of the relative means of the parties, 
  we are of the view that the respondent's child support arrears should be rescinded 
  as per Stong J.'s order and that there should be no order under s. 7 of the 
  Guidelines for post-secondary educational expenses.</p>
<p>
  [7] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part, the order of Stong J. varied 
  in accordance with these reasons, with each party to bear his or her own costs 
  of the appeal.</p>
<p> Signed: &quot;R.S. Abella J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;M.J. Moldaver J.A.&quot;<br>
