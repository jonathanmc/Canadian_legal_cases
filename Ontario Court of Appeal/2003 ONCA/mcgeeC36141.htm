<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Paul G. M. Hermiston of the 
  Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated September 27, 2000.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant advances two submissions:</p>
<p class="indent">1. The trial judge erred in failing to find that the appellant's 
  rights under section 10(b) of the Charter had been violated. Thus, he erred 
  in admitting the appellant's statement to the police; and</p>
<p class="indent"> 2. The trial judge erred in failing to give a limiting instruction 
  to the jury on its use of the appellant's statements.</p>
<p>
  We do not agree with either submission.</p>
<p>
  [2] The trial judge found that the appellant was given a reasonable opportunity 
  to exercise his right to counsel and unequivocally waived that right. That finding 
  was open to the trial judge and we therefore have no basis to interfere with 
  it. </p>
<p>
  [3] In the light of the trial Crown's closing address, it would have been preferable 
  had the trial judge given the limiting instruction argued for by Mr. Breen, 
  at least for the appellant's statement to the police. The Crown on appeal concedes 
  as much. But defence counsel told the jury that the falsity of the appellant's 
  statements could not give rise to an inference of guilt and the trial judge 
  did not instruct the jury that it could use the statements as affirmative evidence 
  of guilt. In these circumstances we are not persuaded that a limiting instruction 
  was required as a matter of law. </p>
<p>
  [4] Moreover, even if such an instruction was required for the appellant's statement 
  to the police, we think the Crown would have been entitled to an instruction 
  on concoction for the appellant's statements to Logan and the complainant. Therefore, 
  any harm caused by the failure to give a limiting instruction was minimal.</p>
<p>
  [5] Finally, even assuming that the failure to give a limiting instruction amounted 
  to an error of law, we would apply the proviso. In our view, the case against 
  the appellant was overwhelming. </p>
<p>
  [6] For these reasons the appeal is dismissed. </p>
