<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the trial judge erred in holding that the measure of damages 
  was the cost of replacement of the entire structure including a new pool and 
  not, as he put it, a &quot;sort of 'patch-up' job&quot;. The trial judge made 
  that finding in the face of other evidence, which he accepted, that although 
  it was necessary to replace the retaining walls, it was only necessary to repair 
  the pool and perform remedial work on the concrete decking.</p>
<p>[2] The plaintiff was entitled to be put in as good a position as he would 
  have been in if there had been proper performance. This would not require replacement 
  of, for example, the entire pool, especially in light of the trial judge's finding 
  that the existing pool remained structurally sound and functional. As was said 
  in Ruxley Electronics and Construction Ltd. v. Forsyth, [1995] 3 All E.R. 268 
  (H.L.) at para. 19, if the plaintiff were to receive the cost of building a 
  new pool and decking &quot;he would have recovered not compensation for loss 
  but a very substantial gratuitous benefit, something which damages are not intended 
  to provide&quot;.</p>
<p>[3] The trial judge also had to take into account that as a result of the remedial 
  work performed by the appellant shortly after installation, the plaintiff has 
  had use of a structurally sound and functional pool for some six (now eight) 
  years, which would be a significant part of the expected life of the pool. The 
  trial judge also had to take into account that replacement of the timber retaining 
  wall with a concrete one, while necessary, would result in a significantly improved 
  structure.</p>
<p>[4] Rather than sending this matter back for a new hearing for assessment of 
  damages, and the added expense that would entail for the parties, we are of 
  the view that there is sufficient material in the record for this court to make 
  a reasonable estimate of damages. Using our best judgment, we would allow the 
  appeal and reduce the damages from $54,980.34 to $25,000. </p>
<p>[5] This is not a case for pre-judgment interest. See Pozios v. 776575 Ont. 
  Ltd. et al., [2001] O.J. No. 1942 at para. 14.</p>
<p>[6] The appellant is entitled to its costs of the appeal, which we fix at $8,000 
  inclusive of GST and disbursements. The trial judge awarded the respondent his 
  costs of the trial. It may be that this award should be varied in light of our 
  judgment. If so instructed, the appellant will have 20 days from the release 
  of these reasons to provide brief written submissions with respect to the costs 
  of the trial. The respondent may respond to those submissions within 10 days 
  and the appellant may reply to thus submission within 5 days.</p>
