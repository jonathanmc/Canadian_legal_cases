<p>On appeal from the Order of Justice Donald S. Ferguson of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 26, 2001.</p>
<p>SHARPE J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] This appeal involves a dispute between two insurance companies over coverage. 
  It turns on whether or not Deborah McIntyre was the &quot;occupant&quot; of 
  a motorcycle within the meaning of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, s. 
  224(1), when she was struck by an uninsured driver.</p>
<p>[2] On July 27, 1997, Deborah McIntyre was travelling on the Don Valley Parkway 
  in Toronto on a motorcycle driven by her husband Joseph McIntyre. When a rainstorm 
  started, they stopped and dismounted under an overpass for shelter. They both 
  waited on an embankment in close proximity to the motorcycle, intending to resume 
  their journey as soon as the rain cleared. Just as Deborah McIntyre approached 
  the motorcycle to retrieve some dry clothing from a saddlebag, an uninsured 
  motorist struck them both. Joseph McIntyre was killed and Deborah McIntyre was 
  seriously injured. At the time of the accident, Deborah McIntyre was not mounted 
  on or operating the motorcycle, and it was not clear whether she was touching 
  the vehicle. </p>
<p>[3] Joseph McIntyre was a named insured in a policy taken out on the motorcycle 
  with the respondent Jevco Insurance Company (&quot;Jevco&quot;). He was also 
  the named insured in a policy taken out with the appellant Pilot Insurance Company 
  (&quot;Pilot&quot;) on two other family vehicles. Both policies contain the 
  statutorily required coverage for claims against the owners and operators of 
  uninsured automobiles. </p>
<p>[4] The Insurance Act, s. 265(2)(c) defines a &quot;person insured under the 
  contract&quot; in respect of claims for bodily injuries to be</p>
<p class="indent">(i) any person while an occupant of the insured automobile</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the insured and his or her spouse or same-sex partner and 
  any dependent relative of either,</p>
<p class="indent10">(A) while an occupant of an uninsured automobile, or</p>
<p class="indent10">(B) while not the occupant of an automobile or of railway 
  rolling stock that runs on rails, who is struck by an uninsured or unidentified 
  automobile&#133;</p>
<p>[5] Section 268(5.2) provides that if more than one policy provides coverage, 
  the claim is to be made against the insurer of the automobile in which the person 
  (either the person insured, spouse or same-sex partner or dependent of the insured) 
  was an &quot;occupant&quot;. Accordingly, if Deborah McIntyre was an &quot;occupant&quot;, 
  Jevco is solely liable for her claim. If she was not an &quot;occupant&quot;, 
  liability for her claim is to be shared between Jevco and Pilot.</p>
<p>[6] The Insurance Act, s. 224(1) defines &quot;occupant&quot; as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">In this part,</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">&quot;occupant&quot;, in respect of an automobile, means,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the driver,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) a passenger, whether being carried in or on the automobile,</p>
<p class="indent">(c) a person getting into or on or getting out of or off the 
  automobile</p>
<p>[7] This matter was presented to Ferguson J. as a motion under Rule 21.01 to 
  determine a question of law. He ruled that Deborah McIntyre was not an &quot;occupant&quot; 
  and therefore was covered under both policies. Pilot appeals to this court</p>
<p>ISSUE</p>
<p>[8] Was Deborah McIntyre the &quot;occupant&quot; of a motorcycle within the 
  meaning of s. 224(1) when she was struck and injured by the uninsured motorist?</p>
<p>ANALYSIS</p>
<p>[9] The motions court judge found that according to the plain meaning of s. 
  224(1), and on the authority of the decision of this court in Axa Insurance 
  v. Markel Insurance Co. of Canada, (2001), 140 O.A.C. 109, Ms. McIntyre could 
  not be considered an occupant as she was not physically &quot;in or on&quot; 
  the motorcycle at the time of the accident. He read the words &quot;whether 
  being carried in or on the automobile&quot; as limiting the word &quot;passenger&quot; 
  to a person actually engaged in the physical activity of being in or on the 
  motorcycle at the time of the accident. For the following reasons, I respectfully 
  disagree with the motions court judge's interpretation and conclude that, at 
  the time of the accident, Ms. McIntyre was an &quot;occupant&quot; of the motorcycle 
  within the meaning of s. 224(1).</p>
<p>[10] There are two decisions of this court to be considered. In Kyriazis v. 
  Royal Insurance Co. of Canada et al. (1991), 82 D.L.R. (4th) 691 (Ont. Ct. Gen. 
  Div.), aff'd (1993) 107 D.L.R. (4th) 288 (Ont. C.A.), the court interpreted 
  the language of the then-current standard automobile insurance policy, which 
  defined &quot;occupant&quot; as &quot;a person driving, being carried in or 
  upon or entering or getting on to or alighting from an automobile&quot;. In 
  Kyriazis, the court found that the plaintiff, who had got out of the motor vehicle 
  he was driving, and was removing snow from the windows at the time of the accident, 
  was not an &quot;occupant&quot; because he was not actually engaged in the physical 
  activity of &quot;driving&quot;. The Court rejected the argument that it should 
  adopt a &quot;zone of connection test&quot; that would focus on a number of 
  factors relating to the intention of the plaintiff, including whether he occupied 
  the vehicle immediately before the accident, whether he got out of the vehicle 
  temporarily intending to resume his journey, and whether his actions at the 
  time of the accident were related in some way to the continued use of the vehicle.</p>
<p>[11] In Axa, supra, the court distinguished Kyriazis and developed a different 
  approach to the interpretation of &quot;occupant&quot; as currently defined 
  in s. 224(1) of the Insurance Act. In that case, the plaintiff had driven his 
  truck to a loading bay. While standing 30 feet from his truck and waiting for 
  his turn to unload, the plaintiff was accidentally struck and killed by a piece 
  of wood that flew off another truck. Although the plaintiff was not engaged 
  in the act of driving at the time, Goudge J.A. nevertheless found him to be 
  a &quot;driver&quot; for the purposes of s. 224(1). In contrast to Kyriazis, 
  which interpreted &quot;occupant&quot; by reference to various physical activities, 
  Goudge J.A. emphasized the importance placed on the status of the person in 
  the current Act: </p>
<p>the Act focuses on the description of the person claiming benefits. It does 
  not turn on the activity being engaged in nor the person's precise location. 
  There is nothing in the statutory definition that requires the person at the 
  time of the incident to be engaged in the act of driving or to be in the vehicle. 
  The requirement is merely that he or she be the driver of the vehicle. (para 
  14)</p>
<p>[12] In addition, Axa held that &quot;driver&quot; had to be interpreted in 
  light of the definitions for &quot;passenger&quot; and &quot;person&quot;. According 
  to Goudge J.A., the qualifying words placed on &quot;passenger&quot; and &quot;person&quot; 
  suggest the following limitation on &quot;driver&quot;: </p>
<p class="indent">&#133; while s. 224(1) does not require that a person be in 
  the vehicle to be &quot;the driver&quot;, by placing s. 224(1)(a) together with 
  the definitions in ss. 224(1)(b) and (c), it suggests that there must be some 
  degree of physical connection with the vehicle for the person to be the driver 
  (para. 18). </p>
<p>[13] In addition to requiring a degree of physical connection between the person 
  and the vehicle, Goudge J.A. further held that the status of &quot;driver&quot; 
  does not attach permanently to a person, but depends on the circumstances at 
  the time (para. 19). Consequently, when determining whether a person is a &quot;driver&quot; 
  under s. 224(1), the question to ask is: would an objective observer answer 
  affirmatively if asked that the person was a driver of the vehicle? (para. 21)</p>
<p>[14] In my view, there are four reasons for following the &quot;objective observer&quot; 
  approach set out in Axa.</p>
<p>[15] First, s. 224(1) should be interpreted in a coherent and consistent manner. 
  The word &quot;passenger&quot;, like the word &quot;driver&quot; identifies 
  a status rather than a physical activity. As the objective observer test is 
  to be used to interpret &quot;driver&quot;, so too should it be used to interpret 
  &quot;passenger&quot;.</p>
<p>[16] Second, I do not accept that the &quot;plain language&quot; of the statute 
  dictates a different approach. I do not agree with the respondent's submission 
  that the qualifying words added to the definition of passenger - &quot;whether 
  being carried in or on the automobile&quot; - indicate that the person must 
  be &quot;in or on the automobile&quot; to be a passenger. The word &quot;whether&quot; 
  indicates an expansion rather than a contraction of the class of persons who 
  are to be considered passengers. Since the word &quot;automobile&quot; is defined 
  by s. 224(1) to include any &quot;motor vehicle required under any Act to be 
  insured under a motor vehicle liability policy&quot;, the phrase qualifying 
  the word &quot;passenger&quot; merely ensures that whatever the precise mode 
  of conveyance, the person conveyed is deemed to be a passenger. It does not 
  follow that the person is only to be considered a passenger while he or she 
  is actually being conveyed. If the narrower meaning were intended, it seems 
  to me that the legislature would have provided that a person is a &quot;passenger 
  while being carried in or on the automobile&quot;. </p>
<p>[17] Third, I see nothing in the Axa decision that requires us to give &quot;passenger&quot; 
  a more limited reading. While Goudge J.A. suggested that the definitions of 
  &quot;passenger&quot; and &quot;person getting into or on or getting out of 
  or off the automobile&quot; indicated that a degree of physical connection with 
  the vehicle was required, at no point did he state that the required degree 
  of connection for a passenger is that of actually being in or on the vehicle. 
  In Axa itself, the court did not require such a stringent physical connection 
  between the person and his vehicle in finding that the plaintiff was a &quot;driver&quot;. 
  Despite the requirement for a degree of physical connection, the result in Axa 
  indicates that a person can be a driver while standing beside the vehicle. In 
  the absence of statutory language mandating a different interpretation, we should 
  strive for consistency when interpreting the same statutory definition. </p>
<p>[18] Finally, finding Deborah McIntyre to be an &quot;occupant&quot; is consistent 
  with the general principle that insurance legislation defining coverage should 
  ordinarily be liberally construed in favour of the insured. In Amos v. Insurance 
  Corp. of British Columbia, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 405, Major J. noted at para. 16 that 
  &quot;traditionally, the provisions providing coverage in private policies of 
  insurance have been interpreted broadly in favour of the insured, and exclusions 
  interpreted strictly and narrowly against the insurer.&quot; Deborah McIntyre 
  will be covered as a spouse under her husband's automobile policy even if she 
  was not an occupant. Unfortunately, others injured in similar circumstances 
  but without similar spousal coverage will be without insurance coverage and 
  left to whatever benefits are available under the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.41, and we must bear that in mind in deciding this appeal. 
  I would add here that when s. 224(1) was added to the Insurance Act in 1990 
  as part of a larger package of amendments, the Minister who introduced the Bill 
  indicated that the aim of the amendments was to provide &quot;everyone injured 
  in an automobile accident with the compensation needed to return to as normal 
  a life as quickly as possible&quot; (Ontario, Legislative Assembly, Official 
  Report of Debates (Hansard), 4 (23 October 1989) at 3176 (Hon. Murray J. Elston). 
  That legislative intention and the general principle of liberal interpretation 
  would be frustrated by a narrow or literal approach that insisted &quot;passenger&quot; 
  is limited to those actually being physically conveyed at the time of the accident. 
</p>
<p>[19] I would apply the Axa &quot;objective observer&quot; test. In my view, 
  an objective observer of the accident would describe Deborah McIntyre as a passenger 
  of the motorcycle at the time she was struck by the uninsured driver. Her presence 
  at the scene of the accident was entirely explained by the fact that she was 
  a passenger on the motorcycle. She and her husband had stopped by the roadside 
  to avoid the rain. She intended to resume the journey as soon as the rain stopped. 
  She remained in close proximity to the motorcycle and did not leave it for any 
  other purpose. Finally, she did not engage in any other activity except to wait 
  for the rain to abate. </p>
<p>[20] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order below, and 
  in its place, substitute an order to the effect that Deborah McIntyre was an 
  occupant of the motorcycle at the time of the accident. The appellant is entitled 
  to its costs of the appeal, fixed at the amount agreed by the parties, namely 
  $7,500.</p>
