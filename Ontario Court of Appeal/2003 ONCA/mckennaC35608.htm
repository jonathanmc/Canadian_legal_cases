<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John C. Wilkins, of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, dated December 15, 2000 and September 7, 2001, reported at 24 C.C.L.I. 
  (3d) 229 and 32 C.C.L.I (3d) 301.</p>
<p>
  GILLESE J.A.:</p>
<p>
  [1] Elizabeth McKenna brought an action against Father Francis Reed and The 
  Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation for the Diocese of Sault Ste. Marie in 
  Canada in which she alleged that Reed had sexually assaulted her.</p>
<p>
  [2] During the course of trial of the action, the plaintiff and all of the defendants 
  entered into a settlement. A further settlement was entered into between the 
  defendants Reed and the Diocese, on the one hand, and the third party insurers 
  other than The Great American Insurance Company and The Chateau Insurance Company, 
  on the other. (Chateau is Great American's successor.) Because Great American 
  and Chateau continued to deny coverage for the plaintiff's claims against the 
  defendants, the third party action by Reed and the Diocese continued against 
  Great American and Chateau, as did the cross claim by the other insurers.</p>
<p>
  [3] At the trial of the third party action, the trial judge held that the insurance 
  policy issued by Great American provided coverage for the plaintiff's claims 
  in the main action against the defendants, Father Francis Reed and The Roman 
  Catholic Episcopal Corporation for the Diocese of Sault Ste. Marie in Canada. 
  As a result, the trial judge found that Great American had a duty to defend 
  the plaintiff's claims against those defendants under that insurance policy. 
  Great American and Chateau appeal from the judgment rendered in the third party 
  proceedings.</p>
<p>THE APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellants raise four issues on appeal.</p>
<p>
  [5] First, the appellants contend that the trial judge erred in finding that 
  there was coverage for Reed under the policy for claims arising from his sexual 
  assaults and batteries. </p>
<p>
  [6] I disagree. Legal liability for bodily injury is set out in section 1 of 
  the policy as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> To pay on behalf of the Insured, all sums which the Insured 
  shall become obligated to pay by reason of any liability imposed by law upon 
  the Insured for damages, including damages for care and loss of services because 
  of bodily injury, sickness, disease, mental anguish and/or mental suffering, 
  including death at any time resulting therefrom, sustained by any person or 
  persons, and occurring during the policy period, caused by an occurrence including 
  assault and battery by a person, arising out of or in the course of his duties 
  as an employee of the Insured, unless committed by or at the direction of the 
  Insured. Without restricting the generality thereof &quot;occurrence&quot; shall 
  include bodily injury, sickness or disease, and death at any time resulting 
  therefrom sustained within the policy period, and caused by any act or acts 
  of omission or commission whether due to negligence, lack of skill, training 
  or qualification, or any other cause, in connection with the rendering of or 
  omitting to render any skilful, trained or professional service which is ordinarily 
  rendered on or to the person of an individual, or in connection with the dispensing 
  of any prescription, remedy, drug or medical supplies. [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [7] I agree with the reasoning of the trial judge on this issue and his conclusion, 
  at paragraph 119, that &quot;[t]he policy as written provides coverage for the 
  very circumstances of the case at bar.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [8] Second, the appellants submit that Reed was not an employee of the Diocese 
  and that coverage was limited to assaults and battery by a person arising out 
  of &quot;his duties as an employee of the Insured&quot;. This point was not 
  raised or argued at trial. It is not open to the appellants to raise this issue 
  for the first time on appeal. In any event, based on the evidence at trial and 
  the terms of the insurance contract, Reed was an employee. Indeed, the appellants' 
  own pleadings treat him as such.</p>
<p>
  [9] Third, the appellants submit that coverage ought to be precluded as the 
  risk of assault or battery by a priest was neither contemplated nor reasonably 
  anticipated at the time that the insurance policy was issued. I disagree. The 
  point of an insurance policy is to transfer the risk of future events, foreseen 
  and unforeseen. Had Great American intended to limit coverage to certain types 
  of events, it ought to have used express words to that effect in the policy. 
  Instead, it chose to use words that are remarkably broad and expansive.</p>
<p>
  [10] Finally, the appellants contend that insurance coverage for the Diocese 
  is limited to assault and battery committed by an employee who is not an insured 
  under the policy. They argue that because Reed is an additional insured under 
  the policy, he cannot also be an employee of the Insured. I do not agree. There 
  is nothing in the policy that stipulates or even suggests such a limitation. 
  Had Great American wished such a limitation, it was open to it to insert language 
  to that effect. The purpose of the insuring agreement was to insure the Diocese 
  against vicarious liability claims against it. To accept the appellants' contention 
  would be to substantially nullify the very coverage that the Diocese bargained 
  for.</p>
<p>
  [11] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  THE CROSS-APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [12] Reed and the Diocese raise three issues on cross appeal.</p>
<p>
  [13] First, the cross-appellants contend that the trial judge erred in allocating 
  liability for the defence costs in such a way as to result in a gap in coverage 
  for Reed and the Diocese.</p>
<p>
  [14] I reject that contention for the following reasons. The trial judge was 
  satisfied that the settlement entered into by Reed and the Diocese with the 
  plaintiff was fair and reasonable and that the attribution of 50% of the Diocese's 
  and Reed's liability to Great American was fair and just. He noted, at para. 
  32, that &quot;it does not necessarily follow that the contribution as among 
  the three insurance policies to the solicitor/client defence costs of Reed and 
  the Diocese, should be on the same basis&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [15] The trial judge found that all three policies of insurance were triggered 
  and that each of the three insurers was obliged to defend both Reed and the 
  Diocese. He referred to an &quot;overall agreement&quot; between Phoenix and 
  Ecclesiastical and the Diocese in which they agreed to pay certain of the Diocese 
  defence costs beginning about six months before the settlement. They never agreed 
  to pay any part of Father Reed's costs.</p>
<p> [16] The trial judge proceeded to consider various factors and found no reason 
  to differentiate among the three insurers, in terms of liability for the costs 
  of defending the main action. Applying authority from this court<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>, 
  he held that each insurer was obliged to bear an equal share of defence costs.</p>
<p>
  [17] The cross-appellants argue that the trial judge's order, combined with 
  the agreement they reached with the other two insurers as to defence costs, 
  will result in Reed recovering only one third of his defence costs for the period 
  during which he was separately represented. They contend that such a result 
  is contrary to their entitlement to full recovery of defence costs.</p>
<p>
  [18] To the extent that there is any shortfall, it results from the agreement 
  made with the two other insurers as to defence costs and not from the order 
  of the judge. The trial judge had to exercise his discretion when determining 
  how to allocate the defence costs. He considered the agreement, along with the 
  other relevant factors, in determining a fair distribution of those costs among 
  the three insurers. I see no error in the manner in which he exercised his discretion. 
  Consequently, there is no basis upon which to interfere with his order in that 
  regard.</p>
<p>
  [19] Second, the cross-appellants submit that they ought to have been awarded 
  the costs of submissions and briefs made on the issue of costs. The trial judge 
  determined that no costs should be awarded for the preparation of costs submissions. 
  He gave reasons for that decision, which include the complexity and importance 
  of the issues raised. I see no basis upon which to interfere with the exercise 
  of the trial judge's discretion in this regard.</p>
<p>
  [20] The third issue relates to the costs of the third party action, which were 
  ordered against Great American on a party-and-party basis. The cross-appellants 
  submit that the trial judge erred in failing to order Great American to pay 
  Reed and the Diocese their costs of the third party proceedings on a solicitor-and-client 
  basis. They say that injustice will occur if the insureds are not fully indemnified 
  for the costs incurred as a result of the wrongful denial of coverage under 
  an insurance policy for which premiums were paid and under the terms of which 
  they are entitled to full indemnification.</p>
<p> [21] This court addressed the issue of costs in a third party proceeding to 
  enforce a duty to defend in Godonoaga (Litigation Guardian of) v. Khatambakhsh 
  (2000), 191 D.L.R. (4th) 221. As in the instant case, Godonoaga involved an 
  insurer that wrongfully denied its duty to defend. Third party proceedings were 
  commenced and a declaration sought that the insurer had a duty to defend. This 
  court found such a duty and awarded costs on appeal and below. The parties requested 
  clarification as to the scale upon which costs had been awarded. This court 
  held, at para. 4, that costs in both courts on all issues should be awarded 
  on a solicitor-and-client basis.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a>:</p>
<p class="indent"> The appellants were entitled to a defence by their insurer 
  without expense to them. Accordingly, that matter now having been determined 
  in their favour, they should have their costs on a solicitor-and-his-own-client 
  scale for the defence of the main action and cross-claims until such time as 
  the respondent insurer serves and files a Notice of Change of Solicitors and 
  takes over the insureds' defence. Such costs would include the conduct of the 
  third party proceedings and the motion before Pitt J. and this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [22] Entitlement to solicitor-and-client costs in the third party proceeding 
  flows directly from the unique nature of the insurance contract which entails 
  a duty to defend at no expense to the insured. The obligation to save harmless 
  the insured from the costs of defending the action is sufficiently broad to 
  encompass the third party proceedings. It is the contractual basis for the claim 
  to solicitor-and-client costs that justifies the award and therefore constitutes 
  an exception to the usual rule that solicitor-and-client costs will not be awarded 
  except in unusual circumstances. </p>
<p>
  [23] I note that English jurisprudence also appears to support the award of 
  solicitor-and-client costs in such situations. See R. Merkin, Colinvaux's Law 
  of Insurance, 7th ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1997) at 405:</p>
<p class="indent"> The assured is entitled to any costs reasonably incurred by 
  him in resisting a claim, by way of damages, where the insurers wrongfully repudiate 
  liability on the policy, and the insurers will face liability for any costs 
  incurred by the assured in forcing the insurers to admit liability under the 
  policy. [emphasis added]</p>
<p> [24] The American case law similarly favours the view that where an insurer 
  breaches its duty to defend and the insured is required to bring a declaratory 
  action to establish the duty, the insured should be reimbursed for those costs 
  that are attributable to establishing the duty.<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a></p>
<p>
  [25] Thus, in my view, the trial judge erred in awarding costs of the third 
  party proceedings against Great American on a party-and-party basis. Accordingly, 
  the cross-appeal is allowed in part. Paragraph 4 of the judgment of Wilkins 
  J. dated December 15, 2000 and September 7, 2001, shall be altered to provide 
  that Great American shall pay to the Diocese and Father Reed their costs of 
  the third party proceedings as against Great American, from commencement to 
  resolution, on a solicitor-and-client basis. </p>
<p>
  [26] In my view, Reed and the Diocese ought to be entitled to a substantial 
  portion of their costs as they successfully resisted the appeal and succeeded 
  on one of three issues on cross-appeal. However, if the parties are unable to 
  agree upon costs, they may make brief written submissions within 15 days of 
  the release of these reasons.</p>
