<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] With respect to the conviction appeal, we see no error in the trial judge's 
  rejection of the appellant's evidence. His reasons reflect a careful analysis 
  of the circumstances surrounding the offence and his findings are supported 
  in the evidence he chose to accept. There was no improper shifting of the burden 
  of proof to the appellant. The verdict was not unreasonable, and there was ample 
  support in the evidence for the conclusion the trial judge reached.</p>
<p> [2] With respect to the sentence appeal, reading the reasons for sentence 
  as a whole, we do not agree that the trial judge considered that it would be 
  an error in principle to impose a conditional sentence. For the reasons he gave, 
  the sentence he imposed was fit and is not one with which this court can appropriately 
  interfere.</p>
<p> [3] The appeal against conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal against sentence 
  is granted but the appeal against sentence is dismissed.</p>
