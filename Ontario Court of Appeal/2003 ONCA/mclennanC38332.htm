<p>IN THE MATTER OF AN APPEAL BY Nelson Duncan McLennan as Executor and Trustee 
  under the Last Will and Testament of John F. McLennan, deceased from the Order 
  of the Honourable Justice Dambrot of the Superior Court of Ontario dated October 
  17, 2001.</p>
<p>On appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court (Farley, McCombs and Sedgwick 
  JJ.) dated February 15, 2002.</p> <p>
  ROSENBERG J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal from the decision of the Divisional Court upholding the 
  decision of Dambrot J. that a collateral mortgage in favour of Royal Trust Corporation 
  of Canada be discharged and requiring that the estate of John F. McLennan repay 
  $5,743,643.71 to the estate of one of his sons, John K. McLennan. In these reasons, 
  I will refer to John F. McLennan and John K. McLennan as McLennan Sr. and McLennan 
  Jr. respectively. The appellant is Nelson Duncan McLennan, another son of McLennan 
  Sr. and his executor and trustee. The other major players in this litigation 
  are Kaptor Financial Inc. and its principal Eric Inspektor. In summary, the 
  appellant alleges that Kaptor assigned to McLennan Sr. the collateral mortgage, 
  the related promissory note, and McLennan Jr.'s personal guarantee. Dambrot 
  J. found that McLennan Sr. failed to prove the assignment. He further found 
  that even if there had been an assignment of the collateral mortgage, it did 
  not secure any debt owing from McLennan Jr. to McLennan Sr. The Divisional Court 
  accepted that there had probably been an assignment of the collateral mortgage, 
  but agreed with Dambrot J.'s second finding and dismissed the appeal by McLennan 
  Sr.'s estate. I agree with the Divisional Court and would dismiss the appeal 
  with costs.</p> <p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>[2] The facts are somewhat complex owing to the manner in which McLennan Jr. 
  and McLennan Sr. conducted business and their deficient, incomplete and vague 
  record keeping. The existence of the collateral mortgage and its purported assignment 
  came to light when the solicitors for the McLennan Jr. estate attempted to sell 
  property owned by McLennan Jr. personally at Dixie Road and Eglinton Avenue 
  in Mississauga (the &quot;Dixie/Eglinton property&quot;). McLennan Jr. had granted 
  a second collateral mortgage over the Dixie/Eglinton property to Royal Trust 
  in the amount of $20 million. This collateral mortgage was registered in 1990 
  and secured the indebtedness of McLennan Jr.'s company, 726114 Ontario Limited 
  (&quot;726&quot;), to Royal Trust. Other security for 726's indebtedness included 
  a promissory note executed by 726 and McLennan Jr.'s personal guarantee.</p> 
<p> [3] McLennan Sr. lived in the Bahamas and from time to time had provided financial 
  support to McLennan Jr. However, for reasons that are not entirely clear from 
  the record, he did not do so directly. Rather, he provided security to Kaptor, 
  which acted as McLennan Jr.'s personal banker. Thus, in 1993, Kaptor took an 
  assignment from Royal Trust of the indebtedness owed by McLennan Jr.'s corporations, 
  including 726 to Royal Trust. The amount of the indebtedness was $8.5 million 
  (not $20 million). The security assigned by Royal Trust to Kaptor included the 
  promissory note, McLennan Jr.'s personal guarantee, and the collateral mortgage. 
  To finance this assignment, Kaptor borrowed money from the Israel Discount Bank 
  of Canada, which was apparently<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> secured 
  by a letter of credit from the Israel Discount Bank of New York. The letter 
  of credit was in turn secured by term deposits that had been pledged by McLennan 
  Sr. McLennan Sr., however, took no security for his agreement to pledge these 
  term deposits. In effect, in 1993, through Kaptor, McLennan Sr. provided $8.5 
  million to his son and did so without any security or, so far as can be ascertained, 
  any written promise from McLennan Jr. to pay back the money. It was McLennan 
  Sr.'s position that, since 1993, the collateral mortgage and debt were held 
  beneficially by McLennan Sr. There is no contemporaneous document that confirms 
  this position. Over the next few years, Kaptor provided loans to McLennan Jr. 
  totaling $38.1 million through funds borrowed from various banks and secured 
  by letters of credit also secured by McLellan Sr.'s pledge of term deposits.</p>
<p>
  [4] In November 1995, Kaptor issued a notice of default to 726 and McLennan 
  Jr.'s other companies and demanded payment of the outstanding amounts. It also 
  issued a notice of intent to enforce security against McLennan Jr. as guarantor 
  of the indebtedness of 726. The corporate debt was not paid as required by December 
  4, 1995. Between February 23, 1996 and March 7, 1996, seven letters of credit 
  totally $29.6 million were drawn upon. </p> <p>
  [5] As to the 726 debt, it appears that on February 15, 1996, Kaptor was paid 
  $8.5 million. While the evidence is not entirely clear, the preponderance of 
  the evidence suggests that neither 726 nor McLennan Jr. paid $8.5 million to 
  Kaptor. Rather, the $8.5 million letter of credit issued in favour of the Israel 
  Discount Bank of Canada was drawn down on February 15, 1996. On March 23, 1996, 
  a mutual release was entered into between Kaptor, 726 and McLennan Jr. That 
  release records that the operating loan facility provided by Kaptor to McLennan 
  Jr., and which stood at $8.5 million on February 29, 1996, &quot;has been repaid 
  or satisfied in full and the Borrowers have no further liability to the Lender&quot;. 
  Importantly, the release stated that all &quot;security granted in support thereof 
  shall be discharged and released by the Lenders&quot;.</p> <p>
  [6] Notwithstanding the March 28, 1996 release, the appellant claims that sometime 
  in late January or early February of 1996, Kaptor had already assigned this 
  same security to McLennan Sr. This assignment was never registered during McLennan 
  Jr.'s lifetime and copies of the purported assignment agreement were only produced 
  in October 2001 during an adjournment of the motion before Dambrot J.</p> <p>
  [7] As I indicated, the question of the collateral mortgage and the other security 
  came to light when the solicitors for McLennan Jr.'s estate attempted to sell 
  the Dixie/Eglinton property. To effect the sale, the solicitors approached Kaptor 
  for a discharge of the collateral mortgage. Kaptor refused and took the position 
  that the collateral mortgage had been assigned to McLennan Sr., even though 
  the records in the hands of the McLennan Jr. solicitors indicated that Kaptor 
  had released the mortgage. To facilitate the sale, the solicitors prepared an 
  assignment of the collateral mortgage to McLennan Sr., which was executed and 
  registered on title in July 1999. The solicitors then sought (unsuccessfully) 
  to obtain a discharge of the collateral mortgage from McLennan Sr., who was 
  then still alive, although incompetent. McLennan Jr.'s estate trustee (the respondent 
  in this appeal) brought a motion before Cullity J. Cullity J. made an order 
  authorizing the sale of the Dixie/Eglinton property, and directing that the 
  first mortgagee be paid out and the balance of the sale proceeds (approximately 
  $5.7 million) be held in trust by McLennan Sr.'s solicitor. The motion before 
  Dambrot J. was to include determination of whether McLennan Jr.'s estate or 
  McLennan Sr. was entitled to these proceeds. McLennan Sr. passed away during 
  an adjournment of the motion before Dambrot J. and so his estate now claims 
  to be entitled to the funds.</p> <p>
  THE REASONS OF DAMBROT J.</p>
<p>[8] McLennan Sr.'s estate's claim to the $5.7 million turns on the assignment 
  in 1996 from Kaptor to McLennan Sr. Despite the assignment, the promissory note 
  always remained in Kaptor's possession. Further, the motions judge found that 
  the assignment agreement that surfaced in the course of the motion deals only 
  with an assignment of the collateral mortgage, not the promissory note or McLennan 
  Jr.'s personal guarantee. Two copies of the assignment agreement between Kaptor 
  and McLennan Sr. were produced during the proceedings before the motions judge. 
  There are significant differences between the two documents. The motions judge 
  drew an adverse inference from the fact that Kaptor's solicitor, who probably 
  drew up the documents, did not provide evidence on the motion on behalf of the 
  appellant. The original assignment agreement has never been produced. The motions 
  judge noted a number of problems with the documents that led him to conclude:</p> 
<p class="indent"> This sorry evidence is simply incapable of satisfying 
  me that the document is a true copy of the assignment agreement, or indeed that 
  any such assignment agreement was actually executed.</p>
<p>[9] He went on to hold that the documents were probably fabrications, but in 
  any event, concluded that the &quot;terms of a finalized assignment agreement, 
  if there was one, have not been proved&quot;. In the alternative, the motions 
  judge held that even if the assignment agreement was not a fabrication and had 
  been executed, on its face it only purported to assign the collateral mortgage. 
  He held that for this collateral mortgage to acquire any value, the mortgage 
  must secure a debt owing from McLennan Jr. to McLennan Sr. This, in turn, depended 
  on an assignment of the underlying loan agreement, including the promissory 
  note and McLennan Jr.'s personal guarantee. The motions judge found that there 
  was good reason to doubt that the promissory note was ever assigned but, in 
  any event, since the promissory note was only a debt of 726, it was not sufficient 
  to secure a debt between McLennan Jr. and McLennan Sr. This depended on McLennan 
  Jr.'s personal guarantee and the motions judge found that this had not been 
  assigned to McLennan Sr. The motions judge concluded that, in these circumstances, 
  the collateral mortgage did not secure any debt owing to McLennan Sr. and, therefore 
  the collateral mortgage was without value to McLennan Sr. Accordingly, the motions 
  judge ordered that the collateral mortgage be discharged and that the sum of 
  approximately $5.8 million held by McLennan Sr.'s solicitor be paid to the McLennan 
  Jr. estate.</p> <p>
  THE REASONS OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT</p>
<p>[10] The Divisional Court was not as skeptical as the motions judge about the 
  authenticity of the assignment agreement. It held that while the motions judge's 
  concerns were valid, its review of the documents and accompanying correspondence 
  persuaded it that the assignment agreement was not a fabrication and that it 
  &quot;appears to record a meeting of intentions&quot;. The legal effect of the 
  assignment agreement remained to be determined. The court concluded, as did 
  the motions judge, that the assignment agreement only assigned the collateral 
  mortgage and not McLennan Jr.'s personal guarantee. This personal guarantee 
  was released by the March 28, 1996 mutual release and acknowledgment between 
  Kaptor, 726 and McLennan Jr. The Divisional Court therefore dismissed the appeal.</p> <p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>[11] The motions judge and the Divisional Court both recognized, correctly, 
  that the collateral mortgage secured a debt owing by 726 to Royal Trust and, 
  by itself, did not create any debt. The lower courts also recognized that McLennan 
  Sr. would acquire value from the collateral mortgage only if the related loan 
  documents (including McLennan Jr.'s personal guarantee) were also assigned to 
  McLennan Sr., thereby giving rise to a debt between McLennan Jr. and McLennan 
  Sr.</p> <p>
  [12] Mr. Finlay, on behalf of the appellant, took as his starting point the 
  finding by the Divisional Court that the assignment agreement was not a fabrication 
  and &quot;appears to record a meeting of intentions&quot;. He submitted that 
  the parties must have intended that McLennan Sr. would receive some value for 
  having provided $8.5 million to Kaptor in 1996. It would make no sense for Kaptor 
  to have only assigned the collateral mortgage, which, by itself, was without 
  value to McLennan Sr. Mr. Finlay submitted that the parties obviously intended 
  that Kaptor transfer everything that Kaptor received from Royal Trust, including 
  McLennan Jr.'s personal guarantee. </p> <p>
  [13] The appellant is faced with findings of fact by the motions judge and the 
  Divisional Court that the assignment agreement only assigned the collateral 
  mortgage. He must therefore demonstrate that their findings were unreasonable; 
  that they made a palpable and overriding error. I have not been persuaded that 
  the motions judge or the Divisional Court made such an error.</p> <p>
  [14] There a number of difficulties with the appellant's position that the parties 
  intended that McLennan Sr. would receive an assignment of the personal guarantee. 
  While the appellant relies on several pieces of evidence to support his view 
  of the transaction, that evidence is unsatisfactory. Further, while the appellant 
  focuses on the assignment in 1996, this ignores the fact that the actual disposition 
  occurred back in 1993, when McLennan Sr. provided security for the letter of 
  credit that enabled Kaptor to purchase from Royal Trust the collateral mortgage, 
  the promissory note and McLennan Jr.'s personal guarantee. In 1993, McLennan 
  Sr. took no security from McLennan Jr. and, as I have indicated, there are no 
  contemporary documents that record any intention in 1993 that McLennan Sr. expected 
  to obtain anything from McLennan Jr. While Mr. Inspektor, Kaptor's principal, 
  later claimed that McLennan Sr. had a beneficial interest in the collateral 
  mortgage, Mr. Inspektor's conduct in November 1995 indicates that he intended 
  to realize on the collateral mortgage and the personal guarantee. This seems 
  inconsistent with his subsequent assertion that McLennan Sr. was the beneficial 
  owner of the collateral mortgage.</p> <p>
  [15] The Divisional Court placed considerable emphasis on the March 28, 1996 
  release. It said the following:</p> 
<p class="indent"> Inspektor's vague evidence as to his view that son 
  and Kaptor did not intend to discharge the collateral mortgage when they executed 
  the mutual release, as it had already been committed to father, does not deal 
  with the personal guarantee of son.</p>
<p>[16] In my view, it was reasonably open to the motions judge and the Divisional 
  Court to take the view that, in view of the unreliability of the evidence provided 
  by the appellant, the lack of documentation and, particularly the wording of 
  the March 28, 1996 release, the parties did not intend to assign the personal 
  guarantee to McLennan Sr., even if, as found by the Divisional Court, they did 
  intend to assign the collateral mortgage to him. Mr. Inspektor was the only 
  person with actual knowledge of the parties' intention either in 1993 and 1996 
  and his evidence is wholly unsatisfactory. Kaptor's lawyer drafted the documents 
  and might have shed light on the transaction but the appellant did not provide 
  any evidence from him. The other evidence relied upon by the appellant is mostly 
  hearsay and mostly unreliable. These were sophisticated parties dealing with 
  large amounts of money, acting with the advice of solicitors. The motions judge 
  and the Divisional Court found that the assignment agreement dealt only with 
  an assignment of the collateral mortgage and not an assignment of the personal 
  guarantee. It seems to me that the courts were entitled to find that the parties 
  did not intend to assign the personal guarantee and intended to deal with, and 
  dealt only with, the collateral mortgage, as recorded in the assignment agreement.</p> <p>
  [17] Mr. Finlay submits that an interpretation of the assignment agreement that 
  assigns only the collateral mortgage results in a commercial absurdity-that 
  in exchange for $8.5 million McLennan Sr. received only a worthless mortgage. 
  But this was no ordinary commercial transaction. This was one of several transactions 
  involving family members in which very large sums of money were dealt with, 
  without the father taking any kind of security from the son. As the respondent 
  points out, despite the vast sums of money that McLennan Sr. put at risk to 
  support Kaptor's loans to McLennan Jr.'s companies, there is no evidence that 
  McLennan Sr. ever took security, or ever intended to take security. The commercial 
  absurdity argument also fails to account for the fact that the $8.5 million 
  had been pledged by McLennan Sr. back in 1993 to support the letter of credit. 
  These were unusual transactions but I cannot say that the Divisional Court's 
  and motions judge's view of them was unreasonable.</p> <p>
  [18] The appellant made other submissions concerning subrogation and equitable 
  assignment. However, as Mr. Finlay fairly conceded, those arguments depended 
  on a finding by this court that the parties intended an assignment of the personal 
  guarantee to McLennan Sr. Since I am not prepared to make that finding, it is 
  unnecessary to deal with those submissions.</p> <p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>[19] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs. The respondent may 
  file brief written submissions with respect to costs within 21 days from the 
  release of these reasons. The appellant may file submissions in response within 
  14 days. </p>
