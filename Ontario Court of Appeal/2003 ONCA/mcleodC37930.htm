<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Patricia R. German of the 
  Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated December 17, 2001, and 
  on appeal by the Crown from the sentence imposed by Justice German dated March 
  4, 2002.</p>
<p>
  WEILER J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Mr. McLeod was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment 
  with a parole ineligibility period of ten years. He appeals his conviction and 
  the Crown appeals the period of parole ineligibility. </p>
<p>
  The conviction appeal</p>
<p>
  [2] The basis for the conviction appeal is found in the Crown's address to the 
  jury and in the judge's charge dealing with absence of motive. Towards the end 
  of the Crown's closing address to the jury, Crown counsel told the jury: </p>
<p class="indent"> Ladies and gentlemen, there is no evidence in this case of 
  anyone else having a motive to kill Jenny Figueroa other than John McLeod. There 
  may be some evidence of others assisting Mr. McLeod in some fashion, but the 
  evidence goes no further than that. </p>
<p class="indent">Her Honour will tell you that your duty is to decide this case 
  on the evidence before you and only on the evidence before you. Speculation 
  forms no part of your function as jurors. I'd ask you to look closely at the 
  evidence. If you do so, I believe that you will find the indicators of Mr. McLeod's 
  guilt. In my submission, they appear throughout the evidence. </p>
<p>[3] Towards the end of her charge to the jury, the trial judge reiterated the 
  Crown's position as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Now, the position of the Crown is that you must decide based on the evidence, 
  that you may not speculate but that there is no evidence that anyone else killed 
  Jenny. </p>
<p>
  [4] On behalf of Mr. McLeod, Mr. Lockyer submits that the effect of the Crown's 
  address was to shift the onus to the appellant to show that someone else committed 
  the crime and that the trial judge's instruction approbated the Crown's comments. 
  In support of this submission, he relies on the case of R. v. Parsons, [1996] 
  N.J. No. 317 (N.S. C.A.). In that case Crown counsel told the jury in part, 
  &quot;&#133;if Greg Parsons didn't cause his mother's death who did? Not meaning 
  to suggest that another suspect have to be brought up and presented to you by 
  the defence but in a common sense, logical kind of way, look at the evidence.&quot; 
  Crown counsel then went through a list of people to whom the police had spoken 
  and said the deceased had no enemies and no one in her life about whom she expressed 
  any kind of fear except Gregory Parsons. The court held the jury may have thought 
  that it had to answer the question posed by Crown counsel in his closing submissions 
  before it could acquit the accused. The jury's attention ought not to have been 
  diverted from the real question before it, namely whether the Crown had proven 
  the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial judge ought to 
  have disabused the jury of the notion that they could somehow conclude that 
  the accused was guilty because it may not appear from the evidence that some 
  other person might have committed the crime. </p>
<p>
  [5] That is not the situation here. The Crown was responding to the suggestion 
  raised by the defence that other persons could have been responsible for the 
  murder of the deceased. While other persons may have been involved in making 
  phone calls to relatives of the deceased to advise them that his girlfriend 
  Jenny was dead, there was no evidence that these persons had a motive to kill 
  her. Crown counsel's comment in his closing address respecting motive and the 
  comment by the trial judge in her charge to the jury were accurate comments 
  concerning the evidence that did not have the effect of shifting the onus of 
  proof to the accused. The evidence at trial was that the accused was a very 
  possessive and jealous person, that his girlfriend was going to leave him to 
  go to live in the United States and he therefore had a motive to kill her.</p>
<p>
  [6] We also note that there was no objection to the charge at the time by experienced 
  defence counsel on the basis now raised on this appeal. In fact, after raising 
  some minor evidentiary points in submissions on the charge, defence counsel 
  concluded, &quot;But I believe those are relatively minor points. Generally, 
  in my view, the charge was quite balanced and fair.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [7] We would dismiss this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  [8] A further ground of appeal is based on the judge's charge concerning reasonable 
  doubt. After giving a charge in compliance with R. v. Lifchus, the trial judge 
  added: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If, at the end of the case, based on all of the evidence or lack of evidence, 
  you are not sure that Mr. McLeod committed the offence, you should find him 
  not guilty of it. </p>

<p>
  [9] This last sentence is not in Lifchus. Mr. Lockyer submits that when we talk 
  in everyday language of not being sure of something we are talking in terms 
  of probabilities. There was no Starr direction to the jury in terms of how high 
  above the balance of probabilities the onus of proof is. Combined with the trial 
  judge's other comment discussed above, Mr. Lockyer submits that the burden of 
  proof could have been impacted. We disagree. Immediately preceding the impugned 
  passage the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If, at the end of the case, after considering all of the evidence you are sure 
  that Mr. McLeod committed the offence, you should find Mr. McLeod guilty of 
  it since you would have been satisfied of his guilt of that offence beyond a 
  reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>
  [10] Inasmuch as the trial judge tied the word &quot;sure&quot; to proof beyond 
  a reasonable doubt immediately before the impugned passage, we are of the opinion 
  that the jury would not have been under any misapprehension as to the level 
  of proof required.</p>
<p>
  [11] We would dismiss the appeal from conviction.</p>
<p>
  The sentence appeal from the period of parole ineligibility </p>
<p>
  [12] Section 718.2 (a) (ii) provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following 
  principles: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for 
  any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence 
  or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, 
  abused the offender's spouse or common?law partner or child.</p>
<p>
  [13] The trial judge did not increase the minimum period of parole ineligibility 
  but left it at ten years. The Crown submits that the trial judge erred in principle 
  in not increasing the period of parole ineligibility to 12 to 15 years because 
  the victim was the girlfriend of Mr. McLeod. In R. v. McKnight (1999), 135 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 41, Laskin J.A., for the majority, stated at para. 48: </p>
<p class="indent">
  No two cases are the same but similar cases from this province of brutal second-degree 
  murders of an unarmed wife or girlfriend suggest a range of 12 to 15 years. 
  </p>
<p>
  [14] The evidence disclosed that the victim was stabbed four times in her neck 
  and twice in the left upper arm. There were also thirteen defensive wounds found 
  on her hand. Mr. McLeod then placed her body, which had been cut up, in a suitcase 
  he owned and left it by the side of the Highway 401. About a week later, the 
  victim's cousin received a phone call from a man who said: &quot;Jenny's dead. 
  You can find her body on the side of the 401 going to Montreal. She tried to 
  flee to the United States. There are multiple stab wounds.&quot; The man then 
  hung up. The cousin received another call with the same information. When she 
  asked the caller how he knew this information, he told her that someone had 
  asked him to call. A trace of one of the telephone calls indicated that the 
  call came from a residential account in the name of Neil Johnston and that Mr. 
  McLeod had telephoned this same residential number some thirty-one times. A 
  wiretap of Mr. McLeod's telephone conversations indicated that in one conversation 
  he said that the &quot;girl&quot; was missing and that they had not found her 
  yet. In a further conversation he talked about how deep an item has to be placed 
  for it not to be found and, in the same conversation, stated that he had a picture 
  in the room of the case that &quot;he threw out yonder.&quot; About ten days 
  after the murder, the deceased's body was found by a man driving along the shoulder 
  of highway 401 looking for survey stakes when he saw a suitcase in the grass. 
  He and his associate noticed an odour from it and called Crime Stoppers. This 
  led to the Ontario Provincial Police attending at the scene. </p>
<p>
  [15] In her reasons for sentence, the trial judge described the relationship 
  between the victim and Mr. McLeod as a relationship of boyfriend-girlfriend 
  and as being a relationship of intimacy. Then she said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am satisfied and find the following facts: </p>
<p class="indent"> That Mr. McLeod and Jenny had a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship 
  but were not living together, were not married, nor were they common law spouses.</p>
<p class="indent">While murder is always brutal, I find there was no gratuitous 
  violence in this case.</p>
<p class="indent">There were indignities to Jenny's body after her death and that 
  she was placed in a suitcase and left at the side of the road, but there was 
  a telephone call which I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt was either made 
  by Mr. McLeod or he was instrumental in it being made. Whoever made it certainly 
  had information about Jenny's family, their names, their telephone numbers, 
  and the whereabouts of her body and there was evidenced that connected Mr. McLeod 
  to New York close to the location where the calls came from. This telephone 
  call at least allowed her family to learn she was dead and where her body was, 
  and showed some compassion for their suffering. </p>
<p class="indent">Mr. McLeod is still proclaiming his innocence, so it is impossible 
  for me to consider rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="indent">Without in any way intending to suggest this was less than a 
  tragedy, I do not find that there were aggravating factors such that the time 
  when Mr. McLeod can apply for parole should be extended past ten years. At the 
  time, it will be for the Parole Board to decide on the evidence available to 
  them whether he can be released into the community.</p>
<p>[16] In our opinion, the reasons of the trial judge disclose two errors in 
  principle. </p>
<p>
  [17] The first is that the trial judge appears to have been of the opinion that 
  a distinction should be made because Mr. McLeod and the deceased were boyfriend 
  and girlfriend rather than spouses or living together. Although section 718.2(a)(ii) 
  speaks of spouses and does not mention a boyfriend?girlfriend relationship the 
  same principle is applicable. See R. v. McMaster (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 371 
  (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Barry, [1993] O.J. #3955 (Ont. C.A.), where the victim 
  murdered in each case was the girlfriend of the appellant and the period of 
  parole ineligibility was 12 years. In those cases the court was also dealing 
  with a murder where the victim is involved in a relationship of trust and intimacy 
  between the victim and the attacker. </p>
<p>
  [18] The second error in principle is the trial judge's finding that the phone 
  calls to members of the deceased's family allowed them to learn where her body 
  was and showed some compassion thereby apparently offsetting the aggravating 
  fact that Mr. McLeod committed indignities to her body. Beyond indicating that 
  the body could be found along the 401 in the direction towards Montreal, the 
  phone calls did not give the location of the body. The phone calls did not allow 
  the members of the deceased's family to learn where her body was. We do not 
  see the calls as acts of compassion that could offset such an aggravating factor.</p>
<p>
  [19] The trial judge erred in minimizing the aggravating features on sentence. 
  It therefore falls to us to impose an appropriate period of parole ineligibility. 
  The appellant has no criminal record; was employed; and the information from 
  the institution is that he is a model inmate. He is mature, not given to substance 
  abuse and does not have a mental disorder. Taking into account all of the aggravating 
  and mitigating features, in our opinion the appropriate period of parole ineligibility 
  is 12 years. Accordingly, we would grant leave to the Crown to appeal the period 
  of parole ineligibility, allow the appeal and increase the period of parole 
  ineligibility to 12 years. </p>
