<p>On appeal from the convictions entered on February 9, 2002 by Justice Susan 
  Himel of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, and the sentences 
  imposed by Justice Himel on February 19, 2002.</p>
<p>CRONK J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] The appellant was charged with three counts of sexual exploitation, three 
  counts of sexual interference, and three counts of sexual assault involving 
  his daughter, H.M., when she was between the ages of eight and twelve years. 
  The offences allegedly occurred during each of the summers of 1991, 1993 and 
  1994. In February 2002, after an eleven-day jury trial, the appellant was convicted 
  of one count of sexual assault and one count of sexual interference concerning 
  the 1993 offences. He was sentenced to fifteen months imprisonment on each count, 
  to be served concurrently. The trial judge entered a verdict of not guilty at 
  the end of the trial on the three sexual exploitation counts. The appellant 
  was acquitted of the remaining four counts concerning the 1991 and 1994 offences. 
  He appeals his convictions, seeks leave to appeal against sentence and, if leave 
  be granted, appeals his sentences.</p>
<p>
  I. FACTS</p>
<p>
  [2] H.M. was born in Oakville, Ontario in August 1982. Her parents did not live 
  together and were not in a position to care for her. Accordingly, she was sent 
  as an infant to Trinidad to be raised by her aunt, the appellant's sister. For 
  many years, she travelled frequently to Toronto, accompanied by her aunt or 
  another adult, to visit her father. In addition, the appellant travelled to 
  Trinidad at least annually to see H.M. and to visit his girlfriend who resided 
  in Tobago. He also contributed financially to H.M.'s support. H.M. did not meet 
  her mother until she was seven years of age.</p>
<p>
  [3] According to H.M., when she was eight years of age, she travelled to Toronto 
  with her father to spend the summer of 1991 with him at his condominium. She 
  claimed that her father began to sexually abuse her during that visit. Initially, 
  her father began to kiss her in an intimate fashion on a daily basis by putting 
  his tongue into her mouth. Thereafter, abusive activities by the appellant escalated 
  to include the massaging of her clitoris several times each week, the placement 
  of the appellant's penis between her legs on several occasions, and daily baths 
  during which the appellant would wash and dry her, and rub lotion and powder 
  over her body.</p>
<p>
  [4] H.M. spent the summer of 1992 visiting her mother in the Toronto area. The 
  following year, when she was turning eleven years old, she returned to stay 
  with her father for the summer of 1993. According to H.M., the appellant began 
  taking showers with her that summer, after which he would lay her on a bed, 
  fondle and suck her breasts, and rub lotion and baby powder on her body. The 
  appellant also continued to kiss her in an intimate manner. H.M. could not recall 
  whether oral sex with the appellant began in 1993 or the following summer when 
  she again returned to Canada from Trinidad.</p>
<p>
  [5] H.M. testified that the abuse continued unabated during the summer of 1994. 
  She said that during her two-month visit with her father that year, he continued 
  to kiss her inappropriately more than once per week, and to touch and suck her 
  breasts. As well, he performed oral sex on her more than once per week, requested 
  that she sleep with him in his bed and, on several occasions, positioned the 
  rear of her body against his genitalia while they were using his Jacuzzi bath. 
  H.M. claimed that the appellant also frequently &quot;peeked&quot; at her that 
  summer when she was showering alone.</p>
<p>
  [6] According to H.M., numerous incidents of sexual abuse also took place during 
  the appellant's visits to Trinidad between September 1994 and January 1996. 
  H.M. said that on one occasion during such a visit her father shaved her pubic 
  area. On this and other occasions, he performed oral sex on her. He also required 
  H.M. to masturbate him. In another incident, the appellant encouraged H.M. to 
  put his penis in her mouth. She said that she did so but stopped after a few 
  seconds because she did not want to do it.</p>
<p>
  [7] H.M. alleged that during the period September 1994 to late 1999, she told 
  numerous people about the appellant's abusive activities. She said that in 1994 
  she told her aunt, the appellant's sister, that her father had touched her. 
  According to H.M., her aunt responded by telling her that she should not let 
  her father touch her. Her aunt made her feel that the incidents were her fault. 
  H.M.'s aunt testified at trial for the defence. She denied having been told 
  by H.M. of any abuse by the appellant. She acknowledged, however, that she wrote 
  to H.M. in October 1997, cautioning her that: &quot;It pays to shut-up and think 
  before saying anything regrettable. Anyone has to know all about your family 
  affairs - No, no, no. ...Your future is in your hands. THINK and BE SILENT.&quot; 
  </p>
<p>
  [8] H.M. maintained that she realized the abuse was wrong after taking a biology 
  class at school in early 1996 when she was thirteen years of age. Thereafter, 
  although she again visited her father for part of the summer of 1996, during 
  which he made vulgar and harassing remarks about her breasts and asked to see 
  them, she managed to avoid situations in which further abuse might occur. She 
  refused to allow the appellant to touch her or to see her breasts. Later that 
  summer she told her mother, her brother and a family friend of the abuse. After 
  doing so, she remained at her mother's apartment until the day before her scheduled 
  departure for Trinidad. She said that the family friend spoke to the appellant 
  about the abuse. The appellant became &quot;really angry&quot; at her, stopped 
  contacting her, and began to avoid her.</p>
<p>
  [9] The complainant's mother, Y.M.K., also testified at trial. She confirmed 
  that H.M. had disclosed the appellant's abuse to her during the summer of 1996. 
  She acknowledged that she told her daughter to forgive her father and not to 
  tell anyone about the abuse because it might damage the appellant's reputation. 
  She further advised her daughter not to report the abuse to the police. She 
  claimed that she spoke to the appellant, however, and warned him that she would 
  inform the police if he ever abused their daughter again.</p>
<p>
  [10] H.M.'s mother also testified about other troubling incidents involving 
  the appellant and H.M. She said that during the summer of 1994, she observed 
  that H.M. was unhappy, did not like to be touched, was reluctant to bathe when 
  the appellant was nearby, and was afraid to undress. She also saw the appellant 
  in the bathroom while H.M. was bathing. He was pulling at the shower curtain 
  and H.M. yelled &quot;he's peeping at me&quot;. Y.M.K. claimed that, on another 
  occasion, she saw H.M. sitting and leaning against the appellant on a rocking 
  chair. The appellant's hand was across H.M.'s chest and on her breast. On other 
  occasions, when the appellant hugged H.M., Y.M.K. noticed that his chest was 
  pressed against H.M.'s chest.</p>
<p>
  [11] In addition, Y.M.K. said that on the day before H.M.'s scheduled return 
  to Trinidad at the end of August 1996, she accompanied H.M. to the appellant's 
  home so that H.M. could retrieve her belongings and passport. Y.M.K. claimed 
  that she stayed awake all night at the appellant's home, in the same room as 
  H.M., to prevent any further abuse.</p>
<p>
  [12] In July 1997, H.M. moved to Toronto against her father's wishes to live 
  with her mother. Thereafter, H.M. had minimal contact with the appellant. He 
  terminated his financial support of H.M. at about the same time.</p>
<p>
  [13] During the years 1997 to 2000, H.M. lived with her mother, friends and, 
  ultimately, her boyfriend at his parents' home. During this period, H.M. told 
  her best friend, her boyfriend, and the appellant's former wife about the abuse 
  by the appellant. Her boyfriend testified at trial. He confirmed H.M.'s disclosure 
  to him of her father's abuse and described an incident when he and H.M. met 
  the appellant for dinner. On that occasion, the appellant allegedly was looking 
  at H.M.'s breasts and, according to H.M.'s boyfriend, was &quot;continually 
  looking at her up and down&#133;her legs, her body&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [14] In February 2000, H.M. disclosed the details of her father's sexual abuse 
  to her school guidance counsellor at about the time that she applied to the 
  City of Toronto for financially assisted housing. In her application, she disclosed 
  that she was not living with her father because of his prior abuse of her. </p>
<p>
  [15] The appellant testified at trial in his own defence. He denied abusing 
  H.M. and maintained that all of her allegations of abuse were fabricated. It 
  was his position that H.M. was motivated to lie about him because of the collapse 
  of their relationship, the termination of his financial support, and his relationship 
  with a woman of whom H.M. did not approve. His trial counsel (not counsel on 
  this appeal) argued that there was late disclosure of the abuse by H.M., she 
  was pressured by her boyfriend to make false allegations against her father, 
  and her mother had an &quot;agenda&quot; against the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [16] The appellant also claimed that H.M. was not in Canada at the time of the 
  alleged 1991 offences. In support of that claim, he relied upon travel stamps 
  in H.M.'s expired passport, which he said evidenced travel by her to Canada 
  before and after, but not during, 1991. He also relied on travel stamps in his 
  own passport dating from 1991, which he asserted demonstrated that he was absent 
  from Canada during part of the time that H.M. claimed to have been with him 
  in Toronto.</p>
<p>
  [17] The appellant acknowledged that H.M. lived with him during the summer of 
  1993. In connection with the summer of 1994, however, he maintained that H.M. 
  lived with her mother, and not with him. In support of that claim, he relied 
  upon a letter from H.M. written to him in June 1994, in which H.M. asked if 
  she could move from Trinidad to live with her mother in Canada. The appellant 
  maintained that he refused to allow H.M. to leave her schooling in Trinidad, 
  but that he agreed that she could live with her mother for the summer of 1994. 
  As I discuss later in these reasons, the appellant also relied on three letters 
  written to him by H.M. in August 1997, which he claimed demonstrated that he 
  had a loving, non-abusive relationship with his daughter or, alternatively, 
  that H.M. could not be believed and was prepared to lie to get what she wanted.</p>
<p>
  [18] The appellant further denied that H.M.'s mother had maintained an all-night 
  vigil at his home at the end of August 1996, in the manner described by her. 
  He also claimed that H.M. barged into his condominium apartment in April 2000, 
  demanding the use of it because she had nowhere to live. She had earlier requested 
  use of the apartment and the appellant had declined. He said that, during the 
  April 2000 incident, H.M. threatened him by saying: &quot;You have this place 
  closed up and I have nowhere to live. You are going to regret this. I'm going 
  to destroy you.&quot; H.M. testified that no such conversation took place and 
  that she never threatened her father.</p>
<p>
  II. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [19] Before this court, the appellant raises several issues on his appeals from 
  conviction but, in my view, they may be expressed as follows: (i) did the trial 
  judge err by failing to repeat a W.(D.) instruction in accordance with R .v. 
  W.(D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.) in response to questions posed by 
  the jury during its deliberations; and (ii) are the jury verdicts convicting 
  the appellant of sexual interference and sexual assault in connection with the 
  1993 incidents unreasonable? One issue also arises on the appellant's appeal 
  from sentence, namely, whether the trial judge erred in not imposing conditional 
  sentences.</p>
<p>
  III. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [20] On the view that I hold of these appeals, it is only necessary to address 
  in detail the first issue raised on the appellant's appeals from conviction.</p>
<p> (1) The Need for Repetition of a W. (D.) Instruction in Response to Questions 
  from the Jury </p>
<p>
  [21] The trial judge began her instructions to the jury on the law with an explanation 
  of the meaning of the presumption of innocence. She next outlined, correctly 
  in my view, the nature of the burden of proof applicable in a criminal trial 
  and the meaning of reasonable doubt. Thereafter, she detailed the manner in 
  which credibility assessments may be made and instructed the jury that it was 
  to consider the whole of the evidence in reaching its decision, including the 
  testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits filed at trial. She then provided 
  a textbook instruction in accordance with R. v. W.(D.), supra. Before proceeding 
  to next instruct the jury on the assessment of H.M.'s credibility in particular, 
  the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Keep in mind that you are not compelled to choose between the evidence favouring 
  the Crown and the evidence favouring [the appellant], particularly if each version 
  appears to be credible, in the sense that you are unable, after reasonable and 
  thorough deliberation, to determine which witnesses are telling the truth. Rather, 
  the Crown bears the burden of proving the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable 
  doubt.</p>
<p>
  [22] It is important to observe at the outset that the appellant raises no objection 
  to the trial judge's instructions in the main charge concerning reasonable doubt 
  and the Crown's burden of proof. The trial judge's instructions on those matters 
  in the main charge were comprehensive and clear. Rather, the appellant submits 
  that the progress of the jury's deliberations and the nature of the questions 
  asked by the jury demonstrate that repetition of a full W.(D.) instruction in 
  response to the jury's questions was especially critical in this case, and that 
  the failure to provide such a repeat instruction was a fatal error. For the 
  reasons that follow, in the unique circumstances of this case, I agree. </p>
<p>
  [23] Consideration of the jury's questions during its deliberations must begin, 
  in my view, with reference to one important aspect of the closing addresses 
  by counsel to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [24] Shortly after commencing his closing address, the appellant's trial counsel 
  stressed that there was &quot;absolutely no scientific or medical or psychiatric 
  or any type of clinical evidence whatsoever about [H.M.] having a history of 
  sexual abuse&quot; by her father. He pointed out that there was no D.N.A., fingerprint 
  or other forensic evidence supporting H.M.'s allegations, and suggested that 
  it was a &quot;he say this/she say this&quot; case. Finally, later in his address, 
  he argued that if the events alleged by H.M. occurred, &quot;volumes of evidence&quot; 
  and &quot;independent objective evidence&quot; demonstrating abuse would have 
  formed part of the evidence at trial. He also said: &quot;But the bottom line 
  here is, where is the evidence manifesting, demonstrating this sexual abuse? 
  Where is it? Her words. Her mom's words. No medical reports. No psychiatric 
  reports. No clinical counsellor reports of any kind whatsoever.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [25] Crown counsel began his closing address by responding to those defence 
  submissions. He indicated that the &quot;notion that sexual assault victims 
  should come to court with bags of proof, with evidence of torn garments or blood 
  or medical records&#133;&quot; was not &quot;right&quot;, and was &quot;wrongheaded&quot; 
  and &quot;antediluvian&quot; thinking.</p>
<p>
  [26] In her charge to the jury, the trial judge outlined the Crown's position 
  on this issue by reminding the jury that the Crown maintained that &quot;it 
  is wrongheaded to expect that a complainant in a sexual assault case will come 
  to court with bags of evidence, and that is not required&quot;. Following the 
  charge, Crown counsel objected to that part of the trial judge's review of the 
  positions of the parties on the ground that the trial judge had failed to instruct 
  the jury that the appellant's counsel was wrong to suggest that H.M. was required 
  to provide independent scientific evidence of abuse. The trial judge did not 
  recharge the jury on the issue.</p>
<p>
  [27] The jury retired to consider its verdict at 12:42 p.m. on February 8, 2002. 
  At 9:30 p.m., the jury sent the following three questions to the trial judge: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) Given the lack of tangible evidence, is it possible to 
  reach any decision based on assessment of the credibility of the witnesses?</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) Please review the definition of reasonable doubt; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) Please explain the difference between sexual assault and 
  sexual interference.</p>
<p>
  [28] The trial judge canvassed those questions with counsel. In connection with 
  the first question, trial counsel for the appellant said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I do not know that it is necessary for Your Honour to, in effect, go over much 
  of Your Honour's charge. It seems to me that Your Honour was quite clear in 
  regard to the issue of reasonable doubt on various elements. And perhaps the 
  simple answer that corroboration is not required, coupled with the statement 
  that they have to look at all of the evidence. &#133;They have had a fairly 
  lengthy charge, a detailed charge&#133;and&#133;they couldn't possibly have 
  forgotten that charge by now.</p>
<p>
  [29] In connection with the second question posed by the jury, counsel made 
  the following submissions: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [Crown counsel]: I think Your Honour's charge on reasonable doubt was, from 
  my recollection, close, if not exactly, from model charges. I really don't know 
  how it can be made any better. &#133;I just do not know how Your Honour could 
  improve on it.</p>
<p  class="center">
  &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> [Defence counsel]: Well, I tend to agree with my friend, Your 
  Honour, on this point. &#133;[F]rom my own note of Your Honour's charge this 
  morning on reasonable doubt, it includes how it may arise; for example, that 
  they can't decide on the reliability or credibility of the witnesses. Now, I 
  don't know if that goes beyond what is being requested here, but, in any event, 
  I do not know that there's much more that can be said beyond the boiler plate 
  type of definition.</p>
<p>
  [30] The jury was recalled at 9:40 p.m. In response to the jury's first question, 
  the trial judge again instructed the jury on how to assess the credibility of 
  witnesses and directed the jurors to look at the evidence as a whole. In response 
  to the second question, the trial judge repeated much of her earlier instruction 
  on reasonable doubt. She did not repeat, however, her original W.(D.) instruction, 
  or otherwise allude to it, in her responses to the jury; nor did she emphasize 
  the Crown's burden of proof save for indicating that a finding of probable guilt 
  was insufficient and would mean that the Crown had &quot;failed to satisfy you 
  of [the appellant's] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;. In fairness to the 
  trial judge, neither counsel requested that her W.(D.) instruction, or her instruction 
  on the burden of proof, be repeated or amplified in response to any of the jury's 
  questions. In that regard, both counsel expressed to the trial judge their satisfaction 
  with her earlier instruction on reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [31] The jury resumed its deliberations shortly after the recharge. Approximately 
  one hour later, at about 10:40 p.m., the trial judge received a note from the 
  jury which read: &quot;We have reached a decision on charges number one and 
  two [relating to the 1991 offences]. On charges four, five [relating to the 
  1993 offences], seven and eight [relating to the 1994 offences] we cannot reach 
  a unanimous decision. Please advise.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [32] After hearing submissions from counsel, the trial judge discharged the 
  jury for the evening, with the intention that the jurors resume their deliberations 
  the next day. No W.(D.) instruction was given then, or when the jury reconvened 
  the following morning. Similarly, the trial judge did not then, or later, repeat 
  her instruction on the burden of proof.</p>
<p>
  [33] The jury resumed its deliberations at approximately 9:00 a.m. on the following 
  day. At 3:30 p.m., the jury returned with verdicts of not guilty on the charges 
  relating to the 1991 and 1994 offences and verdicts of guilty on the charges 
  of sexual assault and sexual interference concerning the 1993 incidents.</p>
<p>
  [34] The appellant argues that the questions posed by the jury, particularly 
  the first question, indicate that the jurors were very troubled and were searching 
  for evidence which would confirm or negate the incidents alleged by H.M. Some 
  of the documentary evidence introduced by the appellant - the passports, for 
  instance - suggested that H.M. was not in Canada in 1991. Further, H.M.'s June 
  1994 letter to the appellant supported his claim that H.M. resided with her 
  mother during the summer of 1994, and not with him. On that basis, the appellant 
  asserts that, as the summer of 1993 was the only summer in question when H.M. 
  resided with him, he could only have been convicted of the abusive incidents 
  which allegedly occurred in that year. Stated differently, the 1993 offences 
  were the only offences for which the appellant was unable to produce any documentary 
  or other physical evidence confirmatory or supportive of his innocence. For 
  that reason, the appellant argues, he was convicted by the jury of the 1993 
  offences and acquitted of the 1991 and 1994 offences.</p>
<p>
  [35] Overall, the appellant asserts that the &quot;pattern of the verdicts&quot; 
  in this case can be seen as demonstrating a misapprehension by the jury of the 
  burden of proof and reasonable doubt, especially where the only verdicts of 
  guilty returned by the jury concerned the counts for which there was no documentary 
  support of innocence. It follows, according to the appellant, that the jury 
  had forgotten the W.(D.) instruction by the time that the jury posed its questions 
  concerning the assessment of credibility in the absence of &quot;tangible evidence&quot; 
  and the meaning of reasonable doubt, thus requiring a repetition of the W.(D.) 
  instruction.</p>
<p>
  [36] The credibility of the complainant was a central issue in this trial. The 
  appellant also testified in his own defence. In these circumstances, the burden 
  of proof was of fundamental importance. In R. v. W.(D.), Cory J., writing for 
  a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada, stated at p. 409: </p>
<p class="indent"> In a case where credibility is important, the trial judge must 
  instruct the jury that the rule of reasonable doubt applies to that issue. The 
  trial judge should instruct the jury that they need not firmly believe or disbelieve 
  any witness or set of witnesses. Specifically, the trial judge is required to 
  instruct the jury that they must acquit the accused in two situations. First, 
  if they believe the accused. Secondly, if they do not believe the accused's 
  evidence but still have a reasonable doubt as to his guilt after considering 
  the accused's evidence in the context of the evidence as a whole.</p>
<p class="indent">Ideally, appropriate instructions on the issue of credibility 
  should be given, not only during the main charge, but on any recharge [emphasis 
  in first paragraph in original; emphasis in second paragraph added; citations 
  omitted].</p>
<p>
  [37] Justice Cory then outlined, in the following terms, what has subsequently 
  become known as the W.(D.) instruction (at p. 409): </p>
<p class="indent">
  A trial judge might well instruct the jury on the question of credibility along 
  these lines: </p>
<p class="indent10"> First, if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously 
  you must acquit.</p>
<p class="indent10">Secondly, if you do not believe the testimony of the accused 
  but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit.</p>
<p class="indent10">Thirdly, even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of 
  the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which 
  you do accept, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence 
  of the guilt of the accused.</p>
<p class="indent">[T]he requirement that the Crown prove the guilt of the accused 
  beyond a reasonable doubt is fundamental in our system of criminal law. Every 
  effort should be made to avoid mistakes in charging the jury on this basic principle.</p>
<p>
  [38] Can it be said here, upon a fair reading of the charge and recharge as 
  a whole, that the jury could not have been under any misapprehension as to the 
  correct burden and standard of proof to apply? I am unable to reach that conclusion 
  for several reasons.</p>
<p>
  [39] First, the content of the jury's initial question indicated, as recognized 
  by the trial judge and counsel, that the jury was focused on whether it was 
  possible to assess the credibility of the witnesses in the absence of &quot;tangible&quot; 
  evidence confirmatory of the appellant's innocence or culpability, and how this 
  could be done. In my view, that focus and the question which followed clearly 
  flowed from the closing addresses of counsel, particularly the address of the 
  appellant's trial counsel, in which references were made to the absence of independent 
  evidence confirmatory of abuse. In posing its first question, the jury may well 
  have assumed that there was an obligation to proffer evidence confirmatory of 
  abuse or innocence. An accused bears no burden in a criminal trial to adduce 
  independent evidence confirmatory of innocence. Similarly, no legal requirement 
  for &quot;tangible&quot; proof confirmatory of abuse attaches to the Crown in 
  a sexual abuse prosecution. Accordingly, the jury's focus on such confirmatory 
  evidence - of innocence or culpability - was misconceived.</p>
<p>
  [40] In my view, as some documentary evidence was adduced by the appellant to 
  support his claim of innocence concerning the 1991 and 1994 offences, but was 
  absent in connection with the 1993 offences, the jury's reference to a &quot;lack 
  of tangible evidence&quot; was likely a reference to the lack of physical or 
  documentary evidence concerning the 1993 offences. These, of course, were the 
  very offences of which the appellant was ultimately convicted. The jury's first 
  question, therefore, went to the heart of its task in assessing whether the 
  Crown had discharged its burden of proof in relation to the 1993 offences.</p>
<p>
  [41] Second, although the trial judge gave a correct W.(D.) instruction in her 
  main charge, the fact and content of the jury's first question indicates that 
  it was in doubt regarding the Crown's burden and the concept of reasonable doubt 
  as it applied to the assessment of credibility. As Cory J. observed in R. v. 
  W.(D.), it is significant that the recharge was the result of questions from 
  the jury. He said in that connection (at p. 410): </p>
<p class="indent">
  When a jury submits a question, it gives a clear indication of the problem the 
  jury is having with a case. Those questions merit a full, careful and correct 
  response. As well, the answer should remind the jury of its instructions given 
  in the course of the main charge.</p>
<p>
  [42] The fact that the jury related the absence of &quot;tangible&quot; evidence 
  to the assessment of the witnesses' credibility signified that the jury misunderstood, 
  or had forgotten, the important direction provided by the W.(D.) instruction: 
  a reasonable doubt could arise, mandating an acquittal, where no determination 
  of the reliability of the testimony of the witnesses could be made. Simply put, 
  I believe that the jury's first question demonstrated that the W.(D.) instruction 
  was not then on the jury's radar screen, and had either been forgotten, discarded, 
  or misunderstood from the outset.</p>
<p>
  [43] Third, if there was any doubt concerning the import of the jury's first 
  question, it was laid to rest by the nature of the jury's second question, which 
  was an express request for assistance concerning the meaning of reasonable doubt. 
  </p>
<p>
  [44] Fourth, the jury's questions were posed at a key time, more than nine hours 
  after the jury had commenced its deliberations. Thus, unlike R. v. W.(D.), this 
  was not a case where only a short time elapsed between the lengthy main charge 
  and the brief recharge. As Cory J. observed in R. v. W.(D.) (at p. 411): </p>
<p class="indent">
  If the error had occurred in the course of a response to a question from the 
  jury or if the recharge had been given some hours after the main charge, a new 
  trial would have to be ordered. </p>
<p>
  [45] In this case, the correct instructions by the trial judge in the main charge 
  concerning the burden of proof, reasonable doubt, and R. v. W.(D.) were probably 
  not fresh in the minds of the jurors at the time of the recharge. The first 
  question from the jury manifested its concern and its desire for direction on 
  the assessment of credibility. That question invited and, in my view, required, 
  a renewed W.(D.) instruction. Indeed, such an instruction would have been a 
  full legal answer to the query posed by the jury. While a W.(D.) instruction 
  was not strictly necessary in response to the jury's second question, standing 
  alone, the first question indicated that there was a critical need to remind 
  the jury of the W.(D.) formulation before it resumed its deliberations. The 
  jury's second question reinforced that need and provided another opportunity 
  for the instruction. </p>
<p>
  [46] In summary, given the absence of a renewed W.(D.) instruction, the content 
  of the jury's first two questions, their integral connection to the jury's fundamental 
  task of determining the appellant's innocence or culpability, and the stage 
  of the jury's delib-erations at which the questions were posed, I am unable 
  to conclude that the jury had not lost sight of the burden of proof and had 
  not misapprehended the bases on which it was required to acquit the appellant 
  of the counts concerning the 1993 offences. The failure to repeat the W.(D.) 
  instruction, in the particular circumstances here, was a reversible error. On 
  that ground alone, I would allow the appeals from conviction and direct a new 
  trial.</p>
<p>
  [47] In reaching that conclusion, I have considered the decision of this court 
  in R. v. Scott, [2002] O.J. No. 1210, relied upon by the Crown. In Scott, the 
  jury requested during the course of its deliberations &quot;a clear definition 
  of reasonable doubt.&quot; As in the case at bar, the appellant argued in Scott 
  that the answer provided to that question was incomplete because it ought to 
  have included a repetition of the W.(D.) instruction referred to earlier by 
  the trial judge. That ground of appeal was rejected by this court for four reasons: 
  no one at trial suggested that the jury's request for a definition of reasonable 
  doubt be interpreted in the manner urged on the appeal; in answering the jury's 
  question the trial judge also invited the jury to tell her if it needed more 
  assistance; a request for further assistance was not forthcoming; and no objection 
  was made by counsel.</p>
<p>
  [48] The facts in Scott differ from those in this case in at least one material 
  respect. In Scott, the jury's questions did not reveal any uncertainty by the 
  jury regarding the burden of proof, the means by which credibility assessments 
  were to be made, or the grounds upon which an acquittal was to be entered in 
  accordance with W.(D.). In the absence of such an indication, the request for 
  a definition of reasonable doubt did not itself trigger the need for the repetition 
  of a W.(D.) instruction. That holding would also apply here, but for the jury's 
  first question in this case. That question, for the reasons given, was an indication 
  of the jury's confusion regarding its fundamental task. The question, therefore, 
  should have sounded the alarm for a W.(D.) instruction.</p>
<p>
  (2) Whether the Jury Verdicts are Unreasonable</p>
<p>
  [49] The appellant makes three arguments in support of his submission that the 
  jury verdicts concerning the 1993 offences are unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  [50] First, he argues that the defence position at trial was misstated by Crown 
  counsel in his closing address and by the trial judge in her charge to the jury. 
  In that regard, trial counsel for the appellant relied in his closing address 
  to the jury on the three letters written to the appellant by H.M. in August 
  1997. In those letters H.M., variously, sought to reconcile with her father, 
  asked if she had offended him, pleaded with him to &quot;take [her] back&quot; 
  and allow her to live with him, told him that he was the &quot;world's greatest 
  dad&quot;, and repeatedly said that she missed him. The appellant argued at 
  trial that the contents of the letters accurately depicted the true nature of 
  H.M.'s relationship with him, that is, an abuse-free relationship. In the alternative, 
  he asserted that the letters undermined the Crown's theory of the case because 
  they demonstrated that H.M. was trying to &quot;con&quot; her father and that 
  she was prepared to lie to get what she wanted, namely, to have her father take 
  her back so that she need not live with her mother any longer. The appellant 
  submits that those two prongs of the defence position were not accurately described 
  to the jury by the trial judge and, indeed, were misstated by Crown counsel 
  and by the trial judge. </p>
<p>
  [51] Second, given that the appellant faced a multi-count indictment, the appellant 
  maintains that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the jury that if 
  it acquitted the appellant on some of the counts on the basis that H.M.'s evidence 
  was not reliable or worthy of belief, the jury was obliged to then consider 
  H.M.'s &quot;demonstrated falsity&quot; when assessing the appellant's culpability 
  on the remaining counts.</p>
<p>
  [52] Third, the appellant submits that the jury reached an unjustifiable compromise 
  in its findings of guilt on the counts concerning the 1993 offences and not 
  guilty on the counts left to the jury regarding the 1991 and 1994 offences.</p>
<p>
  [53] As a consequence of the first two alleged errors by the trial judge, the 
  appellant maintains that the jury was left with an incomplete view of the defence 
  position and an improperly charged approach to the evidence generally, leading 
  the jury to reach an unreasonable verdict based on a misapprehension of the 
  evidence. Accordingly, the appellant argues that his convictions should be quashed 
  and an acquittal entered or, in the alternative, a new trial ordered.</p>
<p>
  [54] I do not accept the appellant's submission that the jury's verdicts convicting 
  the appellant of sexual assault and sexual interference for the events of the 
  summer of 1993 should be set aside, and acquittals entered, on the basis that 
  the verdicts were unreasonable. The test applicable under s. 686(1)(a)(i) of 
  the Criminal Code is well-established. It is whether, on the whole of the evidence, 
  the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could 
  reasonably have rendered: R. v. Biniaris, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381 at para. 36, per 
  Arbour J., quoting R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168 at 185, per McIntyre J. 
  and Corbett v. The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 275 at 282, per Pigeon J.; and R. 
  v. G.(A.) (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 30 at 44 (Ont. C.A.). That test, in my opinion, 
  is not met here.</p>
<p>
  [55] There was sufficient, although not overwhelming, evidence in this case 
  which, if accepted by a properly instructed jury, was reasonably capable of 
  supporting the convictions concerning the 1993 offences. In particular, H.M.'s 
  testimony outlined sexual activities by the appellant in the summer of 1993 
  which, if believed, grounded the appellant's convictions. In my view, on the 
  basis of that testimony and considering the whole of the evidence, it cannot 
  be said that no properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably 
  have convicted the appellant on the counts related to the 1993 offences.</p>
<p>
  [56] The basis of the appellant's challenge here, however, is that the jury 
  was not properly instructed, leading the jury to a misapprehension or erroneous 
  assessment of the evidence. Assuming, without deciding, that the alleged errors 
  in the charge occurred, it would follow that the appellant did not receive a 
  fair trial and a miscarriage of justice occurred. That outcome, if established, 
  would require that the appellant's convictions be quashed and a new trial ordered, 
  not that this court enter verdicts of acquittal: R. v. Morissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.). I have already determined that a new trial is required 
  because of the failure to provide a repeat W.(D.) instruction in response to 
  one of the questions from the jury. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to further 
  consider the two additional errors in the jury charge alleged by the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [57] I also reject the appellant's submission that the jury's findings indicate 
  that it reached unjustifiable compromised verdicts on the charges faced by the 
  appellant.</p>
<p>
  [58] It is true that the note sent by the jury to the trial judge shortly after 
  the recharge indicated that the jury was divided on the counts concerning the 
  1993 and 1994 offences. The jury, however, deliberated for an additional day 
  before reaching its findings on the counts relating to those offences. No further 
  questions were posed by the jury and no further notes were received from it. 
  </p>
<p>
  [59] The jury was entitled to accept H.M.'s evidence on all, some or none of 
  the counts against the appellant. The facts alleged by H.M. concerning the 1993 
  offences differed in several respects from the facts alleged regarding the 1991 
  and 1994 offences. In particular, on H.M.'s evidence, the abusive activities 
  expanded during 1993 to include showering by the appellant with H.M. and the 
  fondling and sucking of her breasts. In addition, the 1993 offences were alleged 
  to have occurred two years after the 1991 offences and one year before the 1994 
  offences. Thus, there was a logical basis upon which to differentiate the abuse 
  allegations.</p>
<p>
  [60] It was open to the jury to accept H.M.'s evidence regarding the events 
  involving the appellant during the summer of 1993 and to reject her evidence, 
  as it implicitly did, concerning the other counts. Accordingly, in my view, 
  the verdicts here are not so at odds as to indicate that the jury was confused 
  regarding the evidence or that it reached an unjustifiable compromise. That 
  result is not occasioned by every &quot;split&quot; jury verdict: R. v. Tillekaratna 
  (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 549 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. McShannock (1980), 55 C.C.C. 
  (2d) 53 (Ont. C.A.). In my opinion, therefore, it cannot be said that there 
  was no rational or logical basis for the verdicts concerning the 1993 offences. 
  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  IV. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [61] For the reasons given, I would allow the appeals from conviction, set aside 
  the convictions, and direct a new trial. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to address 
  the appellant's appeal from sentence.</p>
