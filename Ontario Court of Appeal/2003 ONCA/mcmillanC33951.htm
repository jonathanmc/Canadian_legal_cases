<p>On appeal from the conviction of Justice C. Bruce Noble of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, sitting with a jury, on December 8, 1999 and from the sentence imposed 
  on March 24, 2000.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] Following a trial by judge and jury, the appellant, Gregory McMillan, was 
  convicted of fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud and public mischief. McMillan 
  was the manager of a golf shop, Tee to Green, in Sault Ste. Marie. McMillan's 
  father was the owner of the shop. The Crown alleged that McMillan arranged for 
  several other individuals to burglarize and vandalize the golf shop in order 
  to collect the insurance proceeds.</p>
<p>
  [2] McMillan received a global sentence of 15 months imprisonment for the three 
  offences. He appeals both his conviction and sentence. The principal issues 
  on the appeal are whether the conduct of the chief investigating police officer 
  amounted to criminal activity in its own right and, if so, whether the trial 
  judge should have stayed the charges against McMillan.</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS &#8211; AN OVERVIEW</p>
<p>
  [3] On February 19, 1996, McMillan contacted the police to report that a break 
  and enter had occurred at Tee to Green, numerous items had been stolen, and 
  the shop had been vandalized. McMillan subsequently filed an insurance claim 
  with the store's insurer. As a result, the insurer paid $63,000 to Tee 
  to Green.</p>
<p>
  [4] On December 16, 1996, Kent Schmidt discovered a letter in the snow while 
  he was walking through the strip mall where Tee to Green had been located. He 
  turned the letter over to the police on January 8, 1997. The letter was from 
  Michael Deraiche; it was addressed to the owner of Tee to Green. In the letter, 
  Deraiche stated that he did not get paid for the "job" he did in 
  the wintertime. He threatened to "go to the cops and write a statement" 
  unless a certain car valued at $1,000 was purchased for him and $400 was transferred 
  to his bank account. Deraiche included his address in Elliot Lake and his bank 
  account information in the letter ("the extortion letter").</p>
<p>
  [5] The extortion letter was given to Constable Marty Rowe. Rowe confirmed the 
  existence of the bank account and address given in the letter. He also learned 
  that Deraiche and Terry Beith were under investigation for an unrelated break 
  and enter. Rowe decided to confront Deraiche. Rowe fabricated a one-page police 
  statement in which McMillan purportedly made a complaint against Deraiche for 
  extortion. The statement was hand-written on an official police form and concluded 
  with a "Question and Answer" section.</p>
<p>
  [6] On January 9, 1997, Rowe confronted Deraiche at his residence in Elliot 
  Lake. Rowe showed Deraiche the extortion letter and led him to believe that 
  he would be charged with extortion. Deraiche accompanied Rowe to the Elliot 
  Lake police station. Initially, Deraiche did not want to talk. Rowe then showed 
  Deraiche the fabricated statement, and "as soon as [Deraiche] saw that, 
  he started talking". Deraiche gave a written statement regarding the Tee 
  to Green burglary. He implicated himself, McMillan, Terry Beith and several 
  others. Deraiche stated that he attended Tee to Green with Terry Beith. McMillan 
  showed him around the shop, told him what merchandise to take, said that he 
  wanted it to look like a break and enter, said he wanted the place vandalized, 
  said he would pay for a vehicle to transport the equipment out of town, and 
  told Deraiche that he could keep the merchandise as payment. After making the 
  statement, Deraiche was charged with break and enter and conspiracy to commit 
  fraud. Deraiche subsequently made additional cautioned statements - two in writing 
  and two on video.</p>
<p>
  [7] On January 10, 1997, Deraiche cooperated with the police in a &#8216;video 
  sting' at the Villa Inn. At Rowe's request, Deraiche telephoned 
  McMillan and threatened to go to the police if McMillan did not meet him at 
  the Villa Inn and pay him money. McMillan did not come to the Villa Inn. Instead, 
  on the same day, he attended the police station with counsel and orally reported 
  an attempted blackmail to Constable Marc Cady. McMillan told Cady that a "Mike" 
  had telephoned him and stated he would tell the police that McMillan was involved 
  in the Tee to Green burglary if McMillan did not pay him money. McMillan denied 
  involvement in the burglary and stated he was concerned the allegations would 
  harm his reputation and business.</p>
<p>
  [8] McMillan was arrested on February 6, 1997. Prior to his trial, Terry Beith 
  and Deraiche were found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud arising from the 
  events at Tee to Green. Deraiche was also found guilty of break and enter. </p>
<p>
  [9] There are other facts relevant to the disposition of the appeal. I find 
  it convenient to mention them in the context of the specific issues to which 
  they relate.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [10] The issues on the appeal are: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Did the trial judge err in his charge to the jury on the 
  &#8216;public mischief' count in the indictment?</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Did the trial judge err in permitting the Crown to cross-examine 
  Deraiche on his prior inconsistent statements?</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Did the trial judge err in dismissing the appellant's application 
  to stay the proceedings as an abuse of process?</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Did the trial judge err by not imposing a conditional sentence 
  or, alternatively, by imposing an excessive custodial sentence?</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) The &#8216;public mischief' count</p>
<p>
  [11] The third count in the indictment charged McMillan "with intent to 
  mislead M. Rowe, a peace officer . . . cause him to enter upon an investigation 
  by reporting that the offence of break enter and theft had been committed when 
  it had not been committed, contrary to section 140(1)(c) of the Criminal Code 
  of Canada".</p>
<p>
  [12] Section 140(1)(c) of the Code provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> 140.(1) Every one commits public mischief who, with intent 
  to mislead, causes a peace officer to enter on or continue an investigation 
  by . . .</p>
<p class="indent">(c) reporting that an offence has been committed when it has 
  not been committed;</p>
<p>
  [13] The trial judge instructed the jury that their task was to determine four 
  factual issues: (1) whether McMillan caused Rowe to enter upon an investigation, 
  (2) whether he did so by making a false statement that the golf shop had been 
  broken into and robbed, (3) whether he made the false statement with intent 
  to mislead, and (4) whether Rowe at the time was a police officer. He then told 
  the jury that it was their duty to convict McMillan of public mischief if the 
  Crown had established these items beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [14] Unfortunately, the trial judge did not instruct the jury that they had 
  to determine an additional, and crucial, factual matter &#8211; namely, whether 
  a break enter and theft had or had not occurred. This issue was central because 
  the wording of count 3 of the indictment alleged that McMillan had reported 
  this offence "when it had not been committed".</p>
<p>
  [15] If there was no real break enter and theft (because it was a sham orchestrated 
  by McMillan), then a conviction on this count would be possible. However, if 
  there was a break enter and theft, there could be no conviction on this count 
  because of the "when it had not been committed" wording in the indictment. 
  It follows that this was a crucial issue which had to be put to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [16] I would make an additional observation about the &#8216;public mischief' 
  count in the indictment. In my view, this count is fundamentally at odds both 
  with the other two counts in the indictment against McMillan and with the Crown's 
  indictment against Deraiche. The foundation of the fraud and conspiracy to commit 
  fraud charges against McMillan was that there was a break enter and theft at 
  the golf shop with a view to collecting insurance proceeds. Indeed, in his charge 
  to the jury on these counts, the trial judge regularly spoke of "the break 
  enter and theft". Moreover, the Crown charged Deraiche with break and 
  enter and he was convicted of this offence. Accordingly, it seems to me that 
  count 3 of the McMillan indictment is somewhat disingenuous; it asserts the 
  opposite ("when it had not been committed") of the premise of the 
  other two counts and the charge against Deraiche.</p>
<p>
  (2) Cross-examination of Deraiche on prior inconsistent statements</p>
<p>
  (a) Additional facts</p>
<p>
  [17] Crown counsel called Deraiche as a witness. Deraiche testified that Terry 
  Beith asked him if he wanted to do an "insurance job" at Tee to 
  Green. When Deraiche agreed, Beith told him that "Greg" would provide 
  the money to rent a van. Deraiche testified that nothing else happened between 
  the time Terry Beith first spoke to Deraiche and the time they "did the 
  store". Contrary to his several statements to the police, he made no mention 
  of meeting McMillan at Tee to Green or receiving instructions directly from 
  McMillan.</p>
<p>
  [18] Crown counsel brought an application pursuant to s. 9(2) of the Canada 
  Evidence Act ("the CEA") to cross-examine Deraiche on the prior 
  written inconsistent statements that Deraiche gave to Constable Rowe. A voir 
  dire was held during which Deraiche and Rowe testified about the circumstances 
  surrounding the making of the statements.</p>
<p>
  [19] Deraiche testified that prior to making his written statements, Rowe showed 
  him the statement purportedly written by McMillan. Deraiche was told the statement 
  was written by McMillan and he was "pretty sure" the statement was 
  signed "Greg McMillan". </p>
<p>
  [20] Rowe testified that the fabricated statement was not signed. He had consulted 
  with a crown attorney, who told him the statement should not be signed due to 
  forgery concerns. Rowe did not know the present location of the statement; the 
  statement had not been disclosed to defence counsel. Rowe agreed with defence 
  counsel that his notebook did not mention the fabricated statement; he had no 
  explanation for the omission. Nor did Rowe mention the fabricated statement 
  in his testimony at the preliminary inquiry.</p>
<p>
  [21] Defence counsel submitted that the Crown should not be entitled to cross-examine 
  Deraiche on the prior inconsistent statements because: (1) the fabricated statement 
  was a forgery; (2) the fabricated statement had not been disclosed and was "missing"; 
  and (3) Rowe had not mentioned the fabricated statement in his notebook. Defence 
  counsel submitted these were "classic violations of the principles regarding...obtaining 
  honest and straightforward evidence", and that there were "too many 
  unanswered questions...about how [Deraiche's] statements came about". 
  </p>
<p>
  [22] Crown counsel submitted that the fabricated statement was not signed, and 
  absent a signature, it was not a forgery but merely a ruse.</p>
<p>
  (b) Ruling of the trial judge</p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge ruled that the prior written statements were materially 
  inconsistent with Deraiche's oral testimony. Accordingly, cross-examination 
  should be permitted "absent a consideration of the circumstances under 
  which the statements were received."</p>
<p>
  [24] The trial judge found that the fabricated statement was not signed. This 
  finding was based on Deraiche's testimony that he was "pretty sure" 
  the statement was signed compared to Rowe's certainty that the statement 
  was not signed on the advice of a crown attorney. The trial judge stated that 
  "the use of a &#8216;forged' statement, that is, a statement purported 
  to be executed by the accused McMillan, would be a serious matter and could 
  be grounds for refusing the application." This is consistent with the 
  trial judge's statement during argument that, if he was satisfied on the 
  evidence that the McMillan statement was in fact a forged document, he would 
  exercise his discretion to not allow cross-examination on the prior statement 
  made by Deraiche. However, the trial judge was satisfied that the fabricated 
  statement was not a forged document. He further stated that "[t]here is 
  no suggestion that there is anything sinister in the unavailability of the fabricated 
  statement." He ruled that Crown counsel could cross-examine Deraiche on 
  the prior inconsistent statements. </p>
<p>
  (c) Discussion</p>
<p>
  [25] The trial judge has a discretion whether to permit cross?examination of 
  a witness pursuant to s. 9(2) of the CEA: see R. v. McInroy and Rouse, [1979] 
  1 S.C.R. 588 at 604. In this appeal, the appellant does not contest that the 
  trial judge properly followed the procedure for making a s. 9(2) CEA ruling. 
  It is also clear that Deraiche's testimony was inconsistent with his previous 
  statements to the police.</p>
<p>
  [26] The key issue is whether the trial judge erred in not exercising his discretion 
  to refuse cross?examination on Deraiche's prior inconsistent statements 
  "in view of the circumstances of the taking of the statements": 
  see R. v. Carpenter (No.2) (1982), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 149 at 155 (Ont. C.A.), and 
  R. v. Milgaard (1971), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 206 at 222 (Sask. C.A.), leave to appeal 
  to S.C.C. dismissed (1971), 4 C.C.C. (2d) 566. The appellant contends that the 
  presence or absence of a signature on the fabricated statement was irrelevant 
  to a finding that Rowe committed forgery, and had the trial judge properly instructed 
  himself in this regard he would not have permitted the cross?examination.</p>
<p>
  (i) Relevant Criminal Code provisions</p>
<p>
  [27] The relevant Criminal Code provisions are: </p>
<p class="indent"> 321. In this Part &#8230;</p>
<p class="indent">"false document" means a document</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the whole or a material part of which purports to be made 
  by or on behalf of a person</p>
<p class="indent">(i) who did not make it or authorize it to be made&#8230;.</p>
<p class="indent">366.(1) Every one commits forgery who makes a false document, 
  knowing it to be false, with intent &#8230;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) that a person should be induced, by the belief that it is 
  genuine, to do or to refrain from doing anything, whether in Canada or not.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Making a false document includes</p>
<p class="indent">(a) altering a genuine document in any material part;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) making a material addition to a genuine document or adding 
  to it a false date, attestation, seal or other thing that is material; </p>
<p class="indent">. . . . .</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Forgery is complete notwithstanding that the false document 
  is incomplete or does not purport to be a document that is binding in law, if 
  it is such as to indicate that it was intended to be acted on as genuine.</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) Was the fabricated statement a "false document" under s. 
  321 of the Criminal Code? </p>
<p>
  [28] Under s. 321 of the Criminal Code, a "false document" is a 
  "document the whole or a material part of which purports to be made by...a 
  person who did not make it or authorize it to be made." In R. v. Gaysek 
  (1971) 15 C.R.N.S. 345 at 348, the Supreme Court of Canada held that "any 
  document that is false in some material particular is &#8216;a false document' 
  within the meaning of Part VII of the Code [now Part IX] (offences against rights 
  of property)." The court further held, at p. 352, that "a document 
  which is false in reference to the very purpose for which the document was created 
  is certainly one which is false in a material particular." </p>
<p>
  [29] The principles from Gaysek were applied by this court in R. v. Nuosci (1991), 
  69 C.C.C. (3d) 64. In Nuosci, the appellant altered a cheque, photocopied it, 
  and then photocopied a signature onto the back of that copy. The court held 
  that the photocopy was a false document because it was not what it purported 
  to be. Morden A.C.J.O. reasoned, at pp. 75-76: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [I]t can reasonably by said that the photocopy in this case is false in reference 
  to the very purpose for which it was created. It was created to purport to be 
  a copy of a cheque signed by P. Meffe dated November 8, 1985, in the amount 
  of $30,000 payable to the Nick Di Giovanni Campaign and endorsed on the back 
  by Nick Di Giovanni, when, in fact, it was not a copy of a cheque signed by 
  P. Meffe or one having any of these features. It was, accordingly, false in 
  more than one material particular. </p>
<p>
  [30] In the present case, it is undisputed that: (1) Constable Rowe wrote the 
  statement; (2) the statement was on an official police form; (3) the statement 
  purported to be an extortion complaint by McMillan against Deraiche; and (4) 
  the statement purported to be written by McMillan. It was a matter of dispute 
  as to whether the statement was signed "Greg McMillan". The trial 
  judge found that it was not signed.</p>
<p>
  [31] Pursuant to s. 321 of the Criminal Code, the fabricated statement was a 
  document purported to be made by McMillan and McMillan did not make it or authorize 
  it to be made. On a straightforward application of the statutory provision, 
  the fabricated statement meets the definition of "false document". 
  Additionally, as in Nuosci, the statement was "false in reference to the 
  very purpose for which it was created." That is, the statement purported 
  to be an extortion complaint filed by McMillan against Deraiche whereas McMillan 
  had made no such complaint.</p>
<p>
  [32] It is clear from the case law that a forged signature on a document is 
  itself sufficient to make the document a "false document" within 
  the meaning of s. 321 of the Criminal Code: see R. v. Ogilvie (1993), 81 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 125 (Que. C.A.). However, the parties have not pointed to any case law 
  that states that a document cannot be a "false document" absent 
  a signature. </p>
<p>
  [33] Both parties cite the decision of this court in R. v. Stevenson and McLean 
  (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 526. In that case, two veteran police officers were charged 
  under s. 126(b) of the Criminal Code for using a writing, purporting to be an 
  affidavit, knowing that it was not sworn by the affiant. The officers had been 
  investigating a murder; they falsified an affidavit, purportedly given by the 
  deceased's wife, and showed it to a suspect. This court upheld their convictions, 
  stating at pp. 532-33: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In this case it is quite clear, on the appellants' own evidence, that 
  the sham affidavit was used to obtain an incriminating statement, that is, it 
  was used with the intention of altering Allen's legal position to his 
  detriment. The casting of the document in a form of an affidavit, rather than 
  an ordinary statement purported to have been made by Mrs. Lorenz (and, with 
  respect to this, the forgery provisions in the Code would have to be consulted), 
  was done deliberately to strengthen its impact on Allen&#8230;. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [34] While this case is factually similar to the present case, it does not shed 
  light on whether a signature is required for a statement to be a "false 
  document". I note, however, that the court held, at p. 533, that the officers' 
  good motives (apprehending a person they suspected to be a murderer) did not 
  exculpate them from criminal liability if their conduct fell within the legislative 
  prohibition.</p>
<p>
  [35] In my view, the presence or absence of a signature in the present case 
  is not determinative. The statement was written on a standard police form. At 
  the top of the form, beside "name", the words "Greg McMillan" 
  were written. The statement was written in the first person, as if McMillan 
  had given it. Unlike a cheque or a letter, there is no place on the form for 
  a signature. Section 321 makes no reference to a signature. In my view, the 
  statement fabricated by Rowe comes within the definition of "false statement" 
  in s. 321 of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>
  (iii) Did Constable Rowe commit the offence of forgery?</p>
<p>
  [36] In my view, it is not necessary for this court to determine whether Rowe 
  committed forgery beyond a reasonable doubt. Rowe was not on trial. The hearing 
  was not conducted for the purpose of establishing Rowe's guilt. In R. 
  v. Shirose (1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 257 at 277 (S.C.C.), the court proceeded 
  on the basis that the RCMP had "acted in a manner facially prohibited" 
  by the relevant legislation. The same standard should be applied in this case.</p>
<p>
  [37] Under s. 366(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, a person commits forgery if he 
  or she "makes a false document, knowing it to be false, with intent...that 
  a person should be induced, by the belief that it is genuine, to do or to refrain 
  from doing anything". In this case, Rowe fabricated the statement, knowing 
  it to be false, with the intention of using the document to confront Deraiche 
  in order to induce Deraiche to give him information about the break and enter 
  at Tee to Green. Proceeding on the basis that the fabricated statement was a 
  "false statement" pursuant to s. 321, the evidence establishes that 
  Rowe acted in a manner facially prohibited by s. 366(1) of the Criminal Code. 
  </p>
<p>
  [38] In my view, s. 366(4) further supports a conclusion that the fabricated 
  statement did not need to be signed for the offence of forgery to be committed. 
  Section 366(4) states that "[f]orgery is complete notwithstanding that 
  the false document is incomplete or does not purport to be a document that is 
  binding in law, if it is such as to indicate that it was intended to be acted 
  on as genuine." In this case, Rowe's own testimony established that 
  the statement was "intended to be acted on as genuine."</p>
<p>
  [39] Accordingly, in my respectful view, the trial judge erred in concluding 
  that Rowe did not commit the offence of forgery.</p>
<p>
  (d) Assuming a forgery was committed, should the Crown have been permitted to 
  cross-examine Deraiche?</p>
<p>
  [40] There was a voir dire to determine whether the Crown could cross?examine 
  Deraiche on his prior statements. The trial judge ruled in the Crown's 
  favour. In his ruling, the trial judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I agree with the submissions of counsel for the accused McMillan, that the use 
  of a "forged" statement, that is, a statement purported to be executed 
  by the accused McMillan, would be a serious matter and could be grounds for 
  refusing the application. However, I am satisfied that such is not the case 
  here.</p>
<p>
  [41] During argument on the voir dire, the trial judge spoke in a similar vein: 
  ". . . frankly, in the exercise of my discretion, if I was satisfied on 
  the evidence that the statement was put forward and was in fact a forged document, 
  I would not admit the cross?examination on the statement."</p>
<p> [42] I agree with the trial judge's inclinations. Accordingly, since I have 
  determined that Constable Rowe's conduct did amount to the criminal offence 
  of forgery, it follows that I would conclude that the Crown should not have 
  been permitted to cross?examine Deraiche on his prior inconsistent statements. 
  On this ground alone, a new trial would be required: see R. v. Handy (1978), 
  45 C.C.C. (2d) 232 (B.C.C.A.)<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  (3) The stay application</p>
<p>
  [43] The appellant brought a stay application during the trial. The core of 
  his submissions was that the conduct of Constable Rowe in the investigation 
  constituted an abuse of process in that: (1) Rowe failed to mention the fabricated 
  statement in his notebook; (2) Rowe failed to refer to the fabricated statement 
  in his Will Say statement; (3) Rowe failed to disclose, in answers at the preliminary 
  inquiry, that the fabricated statement was used as an investigative technique; 
  and (4) Rowe lied under oath, in particular that he had received legal advice 
  from a crown attorney and that the fabricated statement was unsigned. </p>
<p>
  [44] The trial judge ruled that: (1) Rowe's failure to mention the fabricated 
  statement in his notes was a "shortcoming", but the standard of 
  note?taking varies from situation to situation and officer to officer; (2) Rowe's 
  failure to mention the fabricated statement in his Will Say was a matter of 
  focus, and no one expects a Will Say to contain every detail; and (3) he was 
  satisfied, largely on the basis of a letter Rowe wrote to the crown attorney 
  after the preliminary inquiry, that Rowe did not attempt to mislead the court 
  with respect to the preparation and use of the fabricated statement; there was 
  no attempt at any time to conceal this investigative technique, as it was discussed 
  with Rowe's colleagues and the crown attorney. The trial judge did not 
  directly address argument (4). He concluded that he was "not prepared 
  to find" that the fabricated statement was a forgery, stating that it 
  was not necessary for him to do so, and it was not central to his consideration 
  of the application. He stated that he "had no criticism of Constable Rowe 
  in the preparation or use of the fabricated statement." He was satisfied 
  that this was not one of the "clearest of cases" that warranted 
  a stay of proceedings based on abuse of process.</p>
<p>
  [45] In Shirose, supra, at p. 275, the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed the 
  test for abuse of process, citing from R. v. Jewitt (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 7 
  (S.C.C.): </p>
<p class="indent">
  I would adopt the conclusion of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Young [(1984), 
  40 C.R. (3d) 289], and affirm that "there is a residual discretion in 
  a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial 
  would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's 
  sense of fair play and decency and to prevent the abuse of a court's process 
  through oppressive or vexatious proceedings". I would also adopt the caveat 
  added by the Court in Young that this is a power which can be exercised only 
  in the "clearest of cases".</p>
<p>
  [46] In Shirose, at p. 285, Binnie J. explained that "[t]he underlying 
  rationale of the doctrine of abuse of process is to protect the integrity of 
  the courts' process and the administration of justice from disrepute". 
  In R. v. Mack (1988), 44 C.C.C. (3d) 513 at 540, the court held that disrepute 
  to the administration of justice may arise from judicial condonation of unacceptable 
  conduct by the investigatory and prosecutorial agencies. </p>
<p>
  [47] In my view, the conduct of Constable Rowe did amount to an abuse of process. 
  The commission of a criminal offence by a police officer is always a serious 
  matter. Moreover, when he fabricated the purported statement by McMillan, there 
  was neither an investigative necessity nor exigent circumstances to justify 
  his conduct.</p>
<p>
  [48] Nevertheless, I do not think that this is one of the "clearest of 
  cases" in which a stay of proceedings is appropriate. I reach this conclusion 
  for three reasons.</p>
<p>
  [49] First, Constable Rowe did not know that his conduct amounted to forgery. 
  Indeed, he sought and received legal advice that his proposed investigative 
  technique was lawful. In Shirose, at p. 287, Binnie J. observed: "A police 
  force that chooses to operate outside the law is not the same thing as a police 
  force that made an honest mistake on the basis of erroneous advice".</p>
<p>
  [50] Second, although the non-disclosure of the fabricated statement is a matter 
  of concern, the factual findings concerning Rowe's conduct made by the 
  trial judge on the stay application (set out above) are entitled to substantial 
  deference.</p>
<p>
  [51] Third, and importantly, there is an alternative remedy for the abuse of 
  process in this case. In R. v. Xenos (1991), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 362, the Quebec 
  Court of Appeal declined to order a stay and instead ordered a new trial in 
  which the tainted evidence of a Crown witness would be excluded. In R .v. O'Connor 
  (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 36 (S.C.C.), L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; J. cited 
  this as "an excellent example [of] finding appropriate remedies in lieu 
  of stays for abuses of process".</p>
<p>
  [52] In my view, the remedy employed in Xenos, and approved by the Supreme Court 
  of Canada in O'Connor, is appropriate in this appeal. Constable Rowe's 
  investigative conduct amounting to the commission of a criminal offence and 
  an abuse of process was directed at a witness, not at the appellant. The abuse 
  of process can be corrected, and a fair trial of the appellant on the serious 
  charges he faces can be achieved, by an order for a new trial at which the evidence 
  of Deraiche, including his statements and his testimony, will be excluded.</p>
<p>
  [53] The appellant argues that much of the other evidence at trial was derivative 
  of Deraiche's statements and should also be excluded from a new trial. 
  In my view, this matter was not sufficiently canvassed at trial. It is a matter 
  that should be decided by the trial judge at the new trial.</p>
<p>
  (4) The sentence appeal</p>
<p>
  [54] In light of the foregoing, this issue does not arise.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [55] I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and sentence and order 
  a new trial at which the statements and testimony of Michael Deraiche would 
  be excluded. I would invite the Crown, before proceeding with a new trial, to 
  seriously consider whether it is logical and fair to proceed against the appellant 
  on count 3 of the indictment.</p>
<p>
  RELEASED: September 12, 2003 ("KMF")</p>
<p> "J. C. MacPherson J.A."<br>
  "I agree K. Feldman J.A."<br>
  "I agree E. E. Gillese J.A."</p>
<hr style="height: 1px; color: #000000">
<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> I note that the appellant also contends 
  that Constable Rowe's conduct in a different aspect of the investigation, 
  namely, the proposed &#8216;video sting' at the Villa Inn, amounted to 
  the offence of extortion. Since this was not an issue on the CEA s. 9(2) voir 
  dire at the trial and since it would not change my analysis or proposed disposition 
  of this ground of appeal, I see no need to address it.</p>
