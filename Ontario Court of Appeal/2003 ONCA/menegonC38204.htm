<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Arthur M. Gans of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated March 6, 2001.<br>
</p>
<p>CHARRON J.A.:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] This appeal concerns the sufficiency of a statement of claim in a proposed 
  representative action by an investor for damages for negligent misrepresentation 
  arising out of the purchase of shares in the open market. <br>
</p>
<p>1. The appellant's claim <br>
</p>
<p>[2] The appellant, Joseph Menegon, is an investor who purchased 300 shares 
  of the defendant Philip Services Corp. (&quot;Philip&quot;) on November 28, 
  1997 in what is commonly referred to as the open or secondary market. Philip 
  subsequently became insolvent. In 1998, Menegon commenced this action, on his 
  own behalf and on behalf of other purchasers of Philip shares, for damages for 
  misrepresentation under s. 130(1) of the Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5 
  and for negligent misrepresentation at common law. He claims damages against 
  the respondents for alleged misrepresentations contained in a prospectus dated 
  November 6, 1997 used in connection with a public offering of Philip shares 
  during the period November 6 to 18, 1997. The audit opinion of the respondent 
  Deloitte &amp; Touche (the &quot;auditors&quot;) in respect of Philip's financial 
  statements for the years ending December 31, 1995 and 1996 was included in the 
  prospectus. The remaining respondents are collectively referred to as the &quot;Canadian 
  Underwriters&quot;. They underwrote the public offering and, as they are required 
  to do under s. 59 of the Securities Act, they certified that the contents of 
  the prospectus constituted &quot;full, true and plain disclosure of all material 
  facts&quot; relating to the shares being offered for sale. <br>
</p>
<p>2. The proceedings before the motions court<br>
</p>
<p>[3] Menegon brought a motion under the Class Proceedings Act, 1992 S.O. 1992, 
  c.6 for an order certifying his action as a class proceeding and appointing 
  him as a representative plaintiff. He also brought a concurrent motion to amend 
  his statement of claim under rule 26 of the Rules of Civil Procedure R.R.O. 
  1990, Reg. 194. The Canadian Underwriters and the auditors brought cross-motions 
  to dismiss Menegon's action on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable cause 
  of action. They moved under rules 21.01(1)(a) [motion for determination of a 
  question of law raised by a pleading] and 51.06(1) and (2) [motion for an order 
  based on an admission of fact]. The latter motion was based on an admission 
  by Menegon on cross-examination that he had had no personal dealings with any 
  of the respondents. <br>
</p>
<p>[4] Menegon conceded before the motions judge that he personally did not have 
  a s. 130 cause of action under the Securities Act since only purchasers who 
  purchase shares offered by the prospectus during the period of distribution, 
  not after, can claim under that section. Section 130(1) reads as follows: <br>
  130. (1) Where a prospectus together with any amendment to the prospectus contains 
  a misrepresentation, a purchaser who purchases a security offered thereby during 
  the period of distribution or distribution to the public shall be deemed to 
  have relied on such misrepresentation if it was a misrepresentation at the time 
  of purchase and has a right of action for damages against,<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the issuer or a selling security holder on whose 
  behalf the distribution is made;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(b) each underwriter of the securities who is required 
  to sign the certificate required by section 59;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(c) every director of the issuer at the time the prospectus 
  or the amendment to the prospectus was filed;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(d) every person or company whose consent has been filed 
  pursuant to a requirement of the regulations but only with respect to reports, 
  opinions or statements that have been made by them; and<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(e) every person or company who signed the prospectus 
  or the amendment to the prospectus other than the persons or companies included 
  in clauses (a) to (d),<br>
  or, where the purchaser purchased the security from a person or company referred 
  to in clause (a) or (b) or from another underwriter of the securities, the purchaser 
  may elect to exercise a right of rescission against such person, company or 
  underwriter, in which case the purchaser shall have no right of action for damages 
  against such person, company or underwriter.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Menegon maintained that he could nonetheless be the representative for 
  the class of purchasers who had a cause of action under s. 130. He argued that 
  the s. 130 claim was in effect a subclass to the common law action for negligent 
  misrepresentation. Hence, the motion turned on the viability of the action at 
  common law.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] The constituent elements for the tort of negligent misrepresentation are 
  set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Queen v. Cognos Inc., [1993] 1 S.C.R. 
  87 (at 110): (1) there must be a duty of care based on a &quot;special relationship&quot; 
  between the parties; (2) the representation in question must be untrue, inaccurate, 
  or misleading; (3) the representor must have acted negligently in making the 
  misrepresentation; (4) the representee must have relied, in a reasonable manner, 
  on the negligent misrepresentation; and (5) the reliance must have resulted 
  in damages to the representee. <br>
</p>
<p>[7] The argument on the motion essentially focused on the first element, the 
  duty of care based on a special relationship. Menegon's pleading, even amended 
  as proposed, does not allege any relationship between him and the auditors and, 
  in respect to the Canadian Underwriters, contains a conclusory statement to 
  that effect but without any material fact in support. Further, Menegon, in cross-examination, 
  admitted that he had no personal dealings with the respondents. <br>
</p>
<p>[8] Menegon argued, nonetheless, that a duty of care arose as a result of the 
  reasonable foreseeability that purchasers of shares in the secondary market, 
  before and after the public offering under the prospectus, would rely on the 
  document to hold, buy or sell Philip shares. He submitted that the respondents' 
  duty of care should not be delimited at the pleading stage on the basis of policy 
  concerns about limitless liability. <br>
</p>
<p>[9] The motions judge rejected this argument. First, he found that the creation 
  of a cause of action for the benefit of purchasers of shares in a secondary 
  market, in the absence of a special relationship, was a matter for the legislature 
  and not the courts. Second, he was of the view that Menegon's argument was contrary 
  to the analysis of the Supreme Court of Canada in Hercules Management Ltd. v. 
  Ernst &amp; Young, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 165 where the court considered the question 
  of duty of care in relation to a claim by individual investors based on their 
  reliance on audit reports. The motions judge held that the reasonable foreseeability/reasonable 
  reliance test did not determine the question of duty of care and that the court 
  was obliged to determine whether the prima facie duty of care ought to be negatived 
  or limited for other reasons. He was of the view that if Menegon's argument 
  was accepted, the Canadian Underwriters and the auditors would be exposed to 
  liability of an indeterminate amount, for an indeterminate time, in respect 
  to, theoretically, an indeterminate class. The motions judge therefore concluded 
  that it was plain and obvious from the appellant's pleading, even if amended 
  as proposed, that the appellant could not establish a special relationship that 
  could give rise to a duty of care. Hence, since neither the existing statement 
  of claim nor the proposed amended pleading disclosed a reasonable cause of action, 
  the motions judge dismissed the action, the motion to amend the pleading, and 
  the motion for certification. <br>
</p>
<p>3. Menegon's position on appeal<br>
</p>
<p>[10] Menegon appeals from the motion judge's decision. His appeal was initially 
  brought in the Divisional Court because an appeal from a refusal to certify 
  an action as a class proceeding lies to that court under s. 30 of the Class 
  Proceedings Act, 1992. The respondents raised a preliminary issue of jurisdiction 
  in that court. The Divisional Court held that, before dealing with the issue 
  of certification, the judgment dismissing the action would have to be set aside 
  and, since the dismissal of the action constituted a final order, the appeal 
  properly belonged in the Court of Appeal. Consequently, by order dated January 
  29, 2002, the Divisional Court traversed the matter to this court. In the event 
  that the appellant is successful on his appeal before this court, it is understood 
  by the parties that the motion for certification of the action as a class proceeding 
  would return to the motions court for determination. <br>
</p>
<p>[11] Menegon argues that the motions judge erred in finding that his pleading 
  did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. His argument on this point focussed 
  entirely on the reasoning of Cumming J. in Mondor v. Fisherman (2001), 15 C.P.R. 
  (4th) 289 (Ont. Sup. Ct.), a decision released after the motion was heard in 
  this case. In Mondor, the proposed representative plaintiffs brought a class 
  proceeding against a number of defendants, including auditors and financial 
  advisors, for losses suffered through purchases of shares in the secondary market. 
  The claim, among other matters, alleged negligent misrepresentation at common 
  law. The defendants moved under rules 21.01(1)(b) and 25.11 to strike the pleadings 
  on the ground that it failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action. <br>
</p>
<p>[12] Cumming J. considered the five constituent elements of an action for negligent 
  misrepresentation as stated in Queen v. Cognos. On the question of duty of care, 
  he considered the pleadings in light of the principles in Anns v. Merton London 
  Borough Council, [1978] A.C. 728 (H.L.) and in Hercules. He succinctly described 
  the two stage analysis as follows (at paras. 39-40): <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; First, a prima facie duty of care is owed when 
  there is a sufficient relationship of proximity between two persons such that 
  it is reasonably foreseeable by the alleged wrongdoer that carelessness on his/her 
  part may cause damage to the other person.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Second, upon a determination of a prima facie duty of 
  care, it is necessary to consider whether there are any factors or policy considerations 
  which ought to negative or limit the scope of the duty, or the class of person 
  to whom the duty is owed, or the damages for a breach of the duty. <br>
</p>
<p>[13] Cumming J. noted that whether a duty of care does or does not exist is 
  a factual enquiry and concluded that &quot;the plaintiff has pleaded material 
  facts in support of the claim of proximity such as to give rise to a prima facie 
  duty of care.&quot; On the second branch of the test in Anns, Cumming J. recognized 
  that something more had to be shown, before imposing a duty on one party to 
  care for the purely economic interest of another, than simply foreseeability 
  that the conduct might cause loss or damage to those interests. He was satisfied, 
  in the case at hand, that the case was sufficiently pleaded. Among other things, 
  he noted that it was pleaded that the defendants intended that the public would 
  rely upon the audited financial statements when making investment decisions.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] On the issue of reliance, Cumming J. referred to the American &quot;fraud 
  on the market theory&quot; which &quot;has been described as a legal fiction 
  which has the effect of overcoming the need to prove reliance.&quot; He noted 
  that this theory was not part of the law of Canada and that proof of reliance 
  is a necessary ingredient of actions based upon negligent misrepresentation. 
  He noted further that the question of whether a plaintiff has actually relied 
  upon a misrepresentation is a question of fact that may be inferred from all 
  the circumstances and, hence, concluded that &quot;it would be premature to 
  foreclose the consideration of this issue in the case at hand beyond the pleading 
  stage.&quot; Consequently, Cumming J. dismissed the motion to strike the pleading. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[15] Menegon submits that, if the motions judge in this case had followed the 
  same reasoning as Cumming J., he would have reached the same conclusion and 
  dismissed the respondents' motions under rules 21 and 51. <br>
</p>
<p>[16] I disagree. The motions judge in this case followed essentially the same 
  analytical framework as followed in Mondor, and, in my view, he followed the 
  correct approach. The different result in this case lies not in a defect of 
  reasoning, but in the insufficiency of the pleadings. When pressed by this court, 
  counsel for Menegon could only refer to paragraph 46C of his statement of claim 
  and paragraph 51 of his proposed amended claim to support his client's contention 
  that the respondents owed the members of the proposed class a duty of care. 
  These paragraphs read as follows: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">46C. The Plaintiff states that the persons who purchased 
  common shares of Philip through the TSE and the MSE during the Class Period 
  were doing so in an open and efficient capital market and they were relying 
  upon the accuracy of the information that Philip was required to provide pursuant 
  to their Continuing Disclosure Obligations.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">51A. The claim for negligent misrepresentation is based 
  on the following factors:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">51B. The Plaintiff states that the Underwriters were 
  negligent in stating in the Certificate of Canadian Underwriters that the Prospectus 
  did constitute full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating 
  to the common shares of Philip and that it did not contain any misrepresentations 
  likely to affect the market value or the market price of the common shares of 
  Philip. The misrepresentations were material and negligently made. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">51C. The Plaintiff states that the Underwriters owed 
  a duty of care to any of its [sic] clients who held and/or purchased common 
  shares of Philip during the Period of Distribution of the Public Offering that 
  the Prospectus did not contain any misrepresentations likely to affect the market 
  value or the market price of the common shares of Philip. The duty of care was 
  created by the special relationship between the Plaintiff and the Underwriters 
  [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">51D. The Plaintiff reasonably relied on the misrepresentations 
  and that damages were incurred by the Plaintiff as a result of the reliance 
  on the misrepresentations.<br>
  [51E. and 51F. then set out particulars relating to the alleged misrepresentations.] 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[17] Paragraph 51, as was later acknowledged by counsel for Menegon in his 
  argument, has nothing to do with the auditors. Further, in respect to the Canadian 
  Underwriters, the pleading refers to two categories of plaintiffs neither of 
  which comprises Menegon. Insofar as paragraph 46C is concerned, it becomes apparent 
  when read in context, that it has nothing to do with either set of respondents; 
  it is targeted solely at the defendant Philip and its directors.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] In my view, the pleadings in this case fall far short of setting out material 
  facts which could give rise to a duty of care to Menegon on the part of the 
  auditors or the Canadian Underwriters. The respondents have provided the court 
  with a copy of the statement of claim under consideration in Mondor for the 
  purpose of comparison. Although the question of the sufficiency of the pleadings 
  in Mondor is not before this court and I infer no comment on the correctness 
  of the decision in that case, it is clear from a quick review of that pleading 
  that Cumming J. was considering quite a different situation than the motions 
  judge in this case. In my view, Gans J. was correct in finding that Menegon's 
  pleading did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. I would not interfere 
  with the result. <br>
</p>
<p>[19] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs. Counsel for 
  the auditors and the Canadian Underwriters have each submitted their bill of 
  costs. The appellant may make written submissions in respect of the quantum 
  of costs within 14 days and the respondents may respond, if so advised, within 
  a further 7 days. </p>
