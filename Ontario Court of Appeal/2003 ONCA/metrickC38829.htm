<p>On appeal from the order of Justice William P. Somers of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 18, 2002 allowing an appeal from the order of Master 
  Cork dated August 13, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In order to resolve this appeal, we need not finally decide whether the 
  letter of complaint and the ensuing investigation by the I.D.A. constituted 
  the requisite 'legal process' needed to satisfy the first branch of the tort 
  of abuse of process, namely: using the legal process for an improper and collateral 
  purpose.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] Assuming that they could satisfy that test, the proposed counterclaim fails 
  because it does not meet the second requirement for the tort, namely: the need 
  for a definite act or threat in furtherance of the illegitimate purpose.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The letter of complaint to the I.D.A. does not fulfil that requirement. 
  The proposed counterclaim does not plead facts of a definite act or threat which, 
  if proved, would sustain the appellants' bare allegation that the letter of 
  complaint was sent to the I.D.A. for the improper purpose of extorting them 
  into settling the respondents' civil claim. In this regard, we find the following 
  passage from Fleming on Torts, 4th ed. (1971) at p. 548 instructive:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The essential elements of abuse of process are: first, a collateral 
  and improper purpose, such as extortion, and secondly, a definite act or threat, 
  in furtherance of a purpose not legitimate in the use of the process. Some such 
  overt conduct is essential, because there is clearly no liability when the defendant 
  merely employs regular legal process to its proper conclusion, albeit with bad 
  intentions [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>See also Atland Containers Ltd. v. Macs Corp. (1974), 7 O.R. 
  (2d) 107 (H.C.J.) at p. 111 and Fleming on Torts, 9th ed. (1998) at p. 688.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] We would accordingly dismiss the appeal, albeit for reasons that differ 
  from those given by Somers J. The respondents are entitled to their costs of 
  the appeal on a partial indemnity basis fixed, as agreed by the parties, at 
  $2,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.<br>
