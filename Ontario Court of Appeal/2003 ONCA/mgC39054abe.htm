<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>The Conviction Appeal</p>
<p>
  [1] In paraphrasing R. v. W.(D.), the trial judge erroneously referred to the 
  &quot;might reasonably be true&quot; standard applicable to recent possession 
  cases. However, it is clear that he totally rejected the defence evidence as 
  fabricated. That evidence could not have assisted the appellant in the application 
  of the second component of the R. v. W.(D.) test.</p>
<p>
  [2] The trial judge was aware of the significant factual conflict in the evidence 
  of the two key Crown witnesses. He considered this conflict in making his findings 
  of fact and was entitled to arrive at the conclusion he did.</p>
<p>
  [3] Counsel agree that both charges arose out of the same delict and that only 
  one conviction should have been entered. The conviction on the charge of assault 
  with a weapon will be stayed.</p>
<p>The Sentence Appeal</p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge did not advert to principles controlling the determination 
  of the appropriate disposition for young offenders. He did not refer to the 
  need to determine that a non-custodial disposition was not appropriate before 
  imposing a custodial term, or the need to limit the length of the custodial 
  term to the term necessary to reflect the applicable principles.</p>
<p>
  [5] We agree with the trial judge that general deterrence was a key factor given 
  the crime committed and its surrounding circumstances. We also agree that incarceration 
  was necessary despite the appellant's age, her first offender status and her 
  strong family support. The governing principles would, however, best be served 
  by a short sharp period of incarceration followed by probation on stringent 
  terms.</p>
<p> [6] We would vary the sentence to time served (about one month) followed by 
  probation for 18 months. Counsel are asked to discuss the appropriate terms 
  and advise the court.</p>
