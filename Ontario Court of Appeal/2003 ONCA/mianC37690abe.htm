<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant seeks to advance a secret trust argument for the first time 
  on appeal. Apart from the propriety of attempting that at this stage of the 
  proceedings, in light of the appellant's concession that the examination for 
  discovery transcript was not before the trial judge, the record does not support 
  that argument.</p>
<p>[2] There is no reason to interfere with the trial judge's determination that 
  the motel transfer was a fraudulent conveyance.</p>
<p>[3] The result of that determination is that the motel becomes an asset of 
  the numbered company and is subject to Mr. Mian's claim against it. Mr. Kahlon 
  may have overpaid for the shares of the numbered company but that does not, 
  in itself, disentitle Mr. Mian to his claim.</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>[5] Costs to the respondent are fixed on a partial indemnity basis in the amount 
  of $4,570 inclusive of disbursement and G.S.T.</p>
<p>&quot;D.R. O'Connor A.C.J.O.&quot;</p>
