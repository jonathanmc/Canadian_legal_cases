<p>On appeal from the decision of Justice Clair B. Marchand of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, dated January 15, 2003 and on appeal from conviction imposed by 
  Justice Kenkel of the Ontario Court of Justice on July 3, 2001.</p>

<p>
  ROSENBERG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant appeals from the decision of Marchand J. dismissing his summary 
  conviction appeal from a finding of guilt by Kenkel J. on a charge of simple 
  assault. The appellant's principal ground of appeal concerns the adequacy of 
  the reasons provided by the appeal court judge. Those reasons are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I have heard able and eloquent submissions of both counsel. I find that the 
  appellant has failed to satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that the learned 
  trial judge made judicial errors in his ruling. The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant contends that these reasons are inadequate. They are, he says, 
  like the reasons of the trial judge described in R. v. Brown ((2002), 170 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 37 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 30, &quot;conclusory and generic &#133; [bearing] 
  virtually no relation to this accused and this case &#133; [and] they could 
  equally apply to any other case on any other charge against any other accused&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [3] I agree with that submission. The appellant had raised several errors of 
  law in his appeal from the summary conviction court as well as allegations of 
  misapprehension of the evidence. In my view, the failure of the appeal judge 
  to give adequate reasons constituted an error of law within the meaning of R. 
  v. Sheppard, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869 at para. 46: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where it is plain from the record why an accused has been convicted or acquitted, 
  and the absence or inadequacy of reasons provides no significant impediment 
  to the exercise of the right of appeal, the appeal court will not on that account 
  intervene. On the other hand, where the path taken by the trial judge through 
  confused or conflicting evidence is not at all apparent, or there are difficult 
  issues of law that need to be confronted but which the trial judge has circumnavigated 
  without explanation, or where (as here) there are conflicting theories for why 
  the trial judge might have decided as he or she did, at least some of which 
  would clearly constitute reversible error, the appeal court may in some cases 
  consider itself unable to give effect to the statutory right of appeal. In such 
  a case, one or other of the parties may question the correctness of the result, 
  but will wrongly have been deprived by the absence or inadequacy of reasons 
  of the opportunity to have the trial verdict properly scrutinized on appeal. 
  In such a case, even if the record discloses evidence that on one view could 
  support a reasonable verdict, the deficiencies in the reasons may amount to 
  an error of law and justify appellate intervention [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [4] The Sheppard decision was applied by the Supreme Court of Canada to the 
  intermediate appellate court in R. v. Owen (2003), 174 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) 
  at para. 60: </p>
<p class="indent">
  To paraphrase R. v. Sheppard &#133; at para. 28, if the deficiencies in the 
  reasons of an intermediate appellate court prevent meaningful appellate review 
  of the correctness of its decision in this Court, then an error of law has been 
  committed.</p>
<p>
  [5] In this court, the appellant's statutory right of appeal is limited by s. 
  839 of the Criminal Code to &quot;any ground that involves a question of law 
  alone&quot;. The appellant is deprived of meaningful appellate review by this 
  court of any such errors by the appeal judge because of the inadequacy of his 
  reasons. For example, it is not possible to know whether the appeal judge found 
  errors but applied the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. It 
  may be that the appeal judge did apply the proviso because of the peculiar use 
  of the phrase &quot;failed to satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that 
  the learned trial judge made judicial errors&quot;. The application of the proviso 
  involves a question of law alone: R. v. Biniaris, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381 at para. 
  19. In failing to give adequate reasons, the appeal judge deprived the appellant 
  of meaningful appellate review of that issue. He also deprived the appellant 
  of meaningful review by this court of the decision by the appeal judge concerning 
  any errors of law by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [6] Alternatively, the appeal judge may erroneously have applied the proviso 
  to errors other than errors of law as occurred in R. v. Fanjoy, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 
  233. Many of the errors alleged by the appellant, such as the misapprehension 
  of the evidence, fall into the category of mixed fact and law. See R. v. Morrissey 
  (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.) at 219-220. Where by reason of errors 
  of mixed fact and law a miscarriage of justice occurred, the provisions of s. 
  686(1)(b)(iii) can have no application. Without reasons from the appeal judge 
  it is not possible to know how the appeal judge dealt with those issues, thus 
  again potentially depriving the appellant of meaningful appellate review.</p>
<p>
  [7] The question of remedy where the intermediate appellate court has failed 
  to give reasons is a difficult one. The appellant submits that if this court 
  should find there was an error of law because of the inadequacy of the reasons, 
  we should go on to consider all the grounds of appeal that were raised before 
  the appeal judge to determine whether the error resulted in a substantial wrong 
  or miscarriage of justice. He submits that if this court, having made its own 
  review of the trial record, is of the view that there was no reversible error 
  it should dismiss the appeal. Alternatively, if this court finds reversible 
  error, the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered. He does not contend 
  that the verdict is unreasonable and that the charge should therefore be dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [8] The respondent submits that the appropriate remedy, if this court finds 
  an error of law by the appeal judge, is to remit the matter to the Summary Conviction 
  Appeal Court where another judge of that court can deal with all of the grounds 
  of appeal - law alone and mixed fact and law. He submits that in this court, 
  the appellant is limited to questions of law alone and thus can only raise errors 
  of law by the appeal judge and trial judge. He submits that this court has no 
  jurisdiction to examine the errors of mixed fact and law allegedly committed 
  by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [9] In my view, the appropriate remedy is that suggested by the appellant. The 
  respondent's submission is not only inimical to judicial economy but fails to 
  recognize that the appeal in this court is from the decision of the appeal judge, 
  not the decision of the trial judge. This court can only decide if the appeal 
  should be allowed by determining whether the error of law by the appeal judge 
  resulted in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. That can only be 
  determined by examining the grounds of appeal raised before the appeal judge. 
  If it is apparent that on the record before the appeal judge the appeal from 
  the trial court was doomed to failure, the appeal judge's error in failing to 
  provide meaningful reasons was of no consequence and the appeal should be dismissed. 
  In my view, this result inevitably follows from Sheppard at para. 55 where Binnie 
  J. set out a number of propositions, including the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where the trial decision is deficient in explaining the result to the parties, 
  but the appeal court considers itself able to do so, the appeal court's explanation 
  in its own reasons is sufficient. There is no need in such a case for a new 
  trial. The error of law, if it is so found, would be cured under the s. 686(1)(b)(iii) 
  proviso.</p>
<p>
  [10] In my view, the corollary to this proposition in the intermediate appeal 
  court context of s. 839 of the Criminal Code is that if in its own review of 
  the record the court of appeal finds that there was reversible error by the 
  trial judge, it cannot apply the proviso and must order a new trial or dismiss 
  the charge, as the case may be.</p>
<p> [11] In my view, this approach is similar to the approach taken by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in R. v. McKay, [1954] S.C.R. 3, albeit under a different statutory 
  scheme. In that case, the majority of the court having concluded on a Crown 
  appeal that the Court of Appeal erroneously allowed the accused's appeal on 
  a question of law, went on to deal with the other question of appeal that had 
  been raised in, but not dealt with by, the Court of Appeal, including issues 
  that Kerwin J. (dissenting in part) described at pp. 305-36 as issues of fact.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  Speaking for the majority at p. 307, Fauteux J. dealt with the question as one 
  of remedy. Once the court is seized with jurisdiction because of the error of 
  law in the intermediate appellate court, the Supreme Court must &quot;give the 
  order which justice requires&quot; (referring to Savard and Lizotte v. The King 
  (1944), 85 S.C.C. 254 at 265). He did not think it &quot;consonant with the 
  diligence required in the proper administration of justice in criminal matters 
  &quot;to remit the case to the Court of Appeal to deal with a question that 
  the Supreme Court was in as good a position to determine&quot; (at p. 308).</p>

<p>
  [12] There may well be other cases where the appropriate order is to remit the 
  matter to the summary conviction appeal court for an entirely new hearing, as 
  where the original proceedings in that court were tainted by a reasonable apprehension 
  of bias. See R. v. Parker (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 190 (N.B.C.A.). For reasons 
  of economy or otherwise, a court of appeal may also wish to remit the matter 
  to the summary conviction appeal court. I am satisfied that a court of appeal 
  would have such a power by the combined operation of ss. 839(2), 686(2) and 
  (8). See R. v. Broda (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 161 (Sask. C.A.) at 164.</p>
<p>
  [13] I therefore turn to the grounds of appeal raised in the appeal court to 
  determine whether the error of law by the appeal judge resulted in a substantial 
  wrong or miscarriage of justice. I will first briefly review the factual background.</p>
<p>
  [14] The complainant in this case is 11-year-old Matthew Dennis. The appellant 
  is the stepfather of Matthew's cousin 12-year-old Shira Young. There is a history 
  of difficulties between the appellant, Matthew and Shira. It is clear that Shira 
  has an intense dislike of the appellant. The appellant has had difficulties 
  with Matthew on prior occasions because of the way Matthew treats the appellant's 
  other children and because of at least one act of theft by Matthew.</p>
<p>
  [15] On the date of the incident that led to the charge, Matthew came to the 
  appellant's home to get Shira. In the ensuing hours Matthew and Shira returned 
  to the appellant's home on several occasions. On the final occasion, when they 
  returned the front door was locked. Shira knocked on the door while Matthew 
  hung back. According to Matthew, the appellant came to the door and for no reason 
  shoved Shira so that she hit her shoulder hard against a brick wall. Then, for 
  no reason and without saying a word, the appellant grabbed Matthew by the shoulders, 
  lifted his body off the ground and punched him in the stomach with so much force 
  that he was thrown off the veranda and down to the concrete patio steps. The 
  children then went into the backyard through the gate to the backyard fence 
  and took the dog. They went to Matthew's home where Matthew noticed a red mark 
  on his chest. When Matthew's mother returned home a short time later, he showed 
  her the mark. A police officer attended about half and hour later but the officer 
  did not see any mark. Shira's version of the altercation at the door was different. 
  She testified that the appellant &quot;twisted&quot; Matthew's stomach and then 
  pushed him out.</p>
<p>
  [16] The appellant gave a very different version of events. He described a tumultuous 
  morning in which his wife first ordered Matthew out of the house because he 
  was causing chaos with the other children. On one of the occasions when the 
  children returned, they seemed to be letting the air out of his tires and were 
  throwing snowballs at the windows. On the final occasion, when Shira and Matthew 
  came to the door, Shira walked past him into the house. The appellant told Matthew 
  that he could not come in. However, Mathew swore at him and tried to push past 
  him. The appellant put his hand on Matthew's shoulder, turned him around so 
  he was facing outside and Matthew then left. The appellant denied touching Shira 
  or assaulting Matthew. The appellant called character witnesses to testify to 
  his reputation for honesty and integrity and for peacefulness. </p>
<p>
  [17] The appellant was originally charged with assaulting both Shira and Matthew. 
  The trial judge dismissed the charge involving Shira.</p>
<p>
  [18] In his appeal to the summary conviction appeal court, the appellant raised 
  as grounds of appeal that the trial judge erred in reversing the burden of proof, 
  misdirected himself as to the use of character evidence and erred in holding 
  the appellant's evidence to a higher degree of scrutiny than the prosecution's 
  evidence. These grounds involve questions of law alone. The appellant also submitted 
  that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence bearing on Matthew's credibility 
  and the appellant's testimony.</p>
<p>
  [19] I can briefly deal with the grounds of law. The question of the burden 
  of proof rests upon the following passage from the reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I reject Mr. Minuskin's evidence as to the manner in which he touched his nephew 
  and I do not find that it raises a reasonable doubt. I do not find that the 
  remainder of the defence evidence raises a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [20] Mr. Sandler, on behalf of the appellant, does not contend that the use 
  of the word &quot;raises&quot; rather than &quot;leaves&quot; in conjunction 
  with reasonable doubt constitutes reversible error. He does submit, however, 
  that the trial judge's approach was to compartmentalize the defence evidence. 
  He points out that there were important parts of the cross-examination of the 
  prosecution witnesses that lent support to the defence case that may not have 
  been brought into the determination of whether there was a reasonable doubt. 
  He relies on this court's decision in R. v. Simons (2001), 146 O.A.C. 48. </p>
<p>
  [21] I agree with this submission. The error by the trial judge rests on a failure 
  to properly apply the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. W. (D.) 
  [1991], 1 S.C.R. 742. In that case at p. 758, Cory J. set out a model instruction 
  to the jury in a case where credibility was important: </p>
<p class="indent"> First, if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously 
  you must acquit.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, if you do not believe the testimony of the accused but 
  you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of 
  the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which 
  you do accept, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence 
  of the guilt of the accused.</p>
<p>
  [22] It is important to stress that trial judges in a judge alone trial do not 
  need to slavishly adhere to this formula. This suggested instruction was intended 
  as assistance to a jury and a trial judge does not commit an error because he 
  or she fails to use this precise form of words. Nor is the trial judge expected 
  to approach the evidence in any particular chronology, for example, looking 
  first at the accused's evidence and then at the rest of the evidence. It should, 
  however, be clear from an examination of the reasons that at the end of the 
  day the trial judge has had regard for the basic principles underlying the W. 
  (D.) instruction. One of those principles is that it is not necessary for the 
  trier of fact to believe or accept the defence evidence for there to be a reasonable 
  doubt. Even if the trier of fact believes the prosecution witnesses, the evidence 
  as a whole may leave the trier of fact with a reasonable doubt. As it was put 
  by Cory J. in W. (D.) at p. 743, the trier of fact must acquit even if he or 
  she does not believe the accused's evidence because they have a reasonable doubt 
  as to the accused's guilt &quot;after considering the accused's evidence in 
  the context of the evidence as a whole&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [23] I cannot be satisfied that the trial judge approached his task in that 
  manner, because, in my view, he misapprehended important parts of the prosecution 
  evidence that would have assisted the defence and because of his erroneous approach 
  to Matthew's credibility. I will turn to those parts of the appeal after dealing 
  with the other grounds of law.</p>
<p>
  [24] As to the use of the good character evidence, the trial judge found that 
  this evidence was of little assistance in the case. He stated that there is 
  &quot;no particular pathology &#133; to domestic violence, it is often committed 
  by persons of otherwise good character and judgment&quot;. The appellant says 
  that while the evidence of peaceful reputation may have been of little use, 
  the trial judge erred in failing to consider the evidence of the appellant's 
  reputation for honesty in judging his credibility. I have reviewed the character 
  evidence. I think it was open to the trial judge to find it was of limited use 
  in this case. While the appellant had a sterling reputation for honesty in the 
  business community the witnesses had limited or no information about his reputation 
  outside that context. The trial judge did not disregard the evidence. The weight 
  to be attached to it was a matter for him as the trier of fact. I see no error 
  of law.</p>
<p>
  [25] The final ground of appeal raised in the appeal court was that the trial 
  judge applied a different stricter level of scrutiny to the evidence of the 
  appellant than that of the prosecution witnesses, especially Matthew. I agree 
  with this submission. Again, however, this error is tied to the misapprehension 
  of the evidence. I will therefore turn to those aspects of the case.</p>
<p>
  [26] The appellant testified that his wife told Matthew to leave the house because 
  he was creating chaos. The trial judge considered this &quot;important because 
  the later incident involves a confrontation at the doorway between Mr. Minuskin 
  and Matthew where Matthew is physically turned around by Mr. Minuskin and sent 
  away from the door&quot;. The trial judge went on, however, to say the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Oddly, no evidence was called to support the assertion that Matthew was in fact 
  told to leave that morning. Mr. Minuskin was busy with his son and states that 
  he &quot;wasn't paying attention&quot; when Matthew was asked to leave. Ms. 
  Burstein [the appellant's wife] was not called as a witness to testify so there 
  is no evidence before the court to support that statement [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [27] Earlier, the trial judge had stated that the appellant was &quot;later 
  told&quot; that his wife had told Matthew to leave. The Crown concedes that 
  the trial judge misapprehended the evidence. The appellant was not &quot;later 
  told&quot; what his wife said to Matthew. The appellant testified that he heard 
  his wife tell Matthew to leave because he was creating chaos with the other 
  children. Thus, there was admissible evidence, not mere hearsay, from the appellant 
  to support this statement. This error might seem trivial except that it was 
  the trial judge himself who considered it &quot;important&quot;. He referred 
  to this part of the case as an important point on two occasions. </p>
<p>
  [28] I am also troubled by the trial judge's reference to the fact that the 
  appellant's wife was not called to testify on this important point. The trial 
  judge was clear that he did not draw a negative inference from the failure to 
  call Ms. Burstein. However, I am concerned that this is an example of the trial 
  judge using a more exacting standard in judging the appellant's credibility. 
  The appellant was never challenged in cross-examination about this part of his 
  testimony. There would have been no reason for him to think that this part of 
  his story required confirmation from another source, especially from his wife, 
  who all the witnesses agree was away from the house during the final encounter 
  that led to the charges, and from whom the appellant was estranged at the time 
  of the trial.</p>
<p>
  [29] On two occasions, the trial judge stated that the appellant &quot;says 
  he was calm throughout&quot;. However, the trial judge found this odd because 
  when the appellant saw the children throwing snowballs he called the police 
  and later yelled out that if Matthew came near his car he would call the police. 
  It is apparent that the trial judge used the appellant's claim that he was calm 
  to find that his testimony was untrue. However, the trial judge misapprehended 
  this part of the evidence. The appellant never testified that he was calm throughout 
  the various encounters that day. The only testimony that the trial judge might 
  have been referring to concerned a very different incident where the appellant 
  called the police because Matthew had stolen a piece of his property. In that 
  context, the appellant agreed with Crown counsel that he was a very patient 
  man. Again, this might seem like a trivial matter except that the trial judge 
  placed such emphasis on it. I would also point out that the trial judge misapprehended 
  the reason why the appellant called the police. He did so because he thought 
  the children were deflating his tires not merely because they were throwing 
  snowballs. However, I would attach little importance to this error.</p>
<p>
  [30] A much more troubling part of the trial judge's reasons is his treatment 
  of Matthew's evidence on the crucial issue of the confrontation at the door. 
  The trial judge said this: </p>
<p class="indent"> In assessing the testimony of the accused regarding his nephew, 
  I do not find credible his assertion that Matthew Dennis said &quot;fuck you, 
  I'm going in anyway&quot; and tried to force himself past Mr. Minuskin. Matthew 
  Dennis is a small, slight young man, he attends a religious school and appeared 
  in court today well dressed and wearing a yarmulke. Everything about his demeanour 
  suggest that he would be reluctant to swear, must less try to force himself 
  past such a bigger and stronger man. I reject Mr. Minuskin's evidence as to 
  the manner in which he touched his nephew and I do not find that it raises a 
  reasonable doubt. I do not find that the remainder of the defence evidence raises 
  a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="indent">Matthew Dennis was a very impressive witness. He was intelligent 
  and remarkably accurate for his age. He testified in a forthright manner and 
  with candour. He admitted throwing snowballs at the house and under very thorough 
  cross, freely admitted past negative behaviour when asked [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [31] The fact that the complainant attended a religious school and his manner 
  of appearance in court were no inidicia of his credibility. Moreover, the idea 
  that as a result Matthew would be &quot;reluctant to swear&quot; is simply inconsistent 
  with the evidence. While denying that he swore at the appellant on this occasion, 
  Matthew admitted in cross-examination that he had sworn at the appellant on 
  other occasions. </p>
<p>
  [32] The trial judge's finding that Matthew testified forthrightly and with 
  candour also seems not to be borne out by the evidence. For example, Matthew 
  initially testified that he treated the appellant's other children well. It 
  was only under further cross-examination that he admitted that he did get into 
  fights with them and punched them. Matthew blamed these fights on the appellant's 
  five-year-old daughter. Matthew also adamantly denied talking to Shira about 
  the incident. This was important because Matthew changed his description of 
  the incident from what he initially told the police. It was the theory of the 
  defence that he did so because after talking to Shira and her mother he realized 
  that his initial description was not physically possible. Shira testified that 
  they talked about the incident on several occasions and she even told Matthew 
  that he was not punched in the stomach. This was an important part of the prosecution 
  case that supported the appellant's position as to Matthew's credibility but 
  was not mentioned by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [33] To conclude, it is my view that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence 
  and the appellant has shown that the errors produced a miscarriage of justice 
  within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(iii). Those errors also infected the trial 
  judge's treatment of the burden of proof and led him to subject the appellant's 
  evidence to a different and stricter scrutiny than that of the complainant. 
  These constitute errors of law. This would not be an appropriate case to apply 
  the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) to cure those errors of law. I cannot say that 
  the verdict would necessarily have been the same had the trial judge properly 
  directed himself. The error of law by the appeal judge in failing to give adequate 
  reasons did prejudice the appellant and the appeal must therefore be allowed.</p>
<p>
  [34] Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and order 
  a new trial.</p>
