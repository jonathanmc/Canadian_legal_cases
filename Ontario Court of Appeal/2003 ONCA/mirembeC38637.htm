<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally December 1, 2003</p>
<p>[1] Counsel for the appellant advanced a number of attacks on the trial judgment. 
  First, he challenges the credibility findings made by the trial judge, particularly 
  in relation to Dr. Tarshis. Counsel says that the trial judge erred in accepting 
  Dr. Tarshis&#146;s reliance on his invariable practice to determine what he 
  did in relation to the appellant. We see no error in this. It was open to the 
  trial judge to accept this evidence particularly given that she found that Dr. 
  Tarshis was generally credible, his evidence made sense and was, to some degree, 
  supported by the documentation.</p>
<p>[2] Counsel also says that Dr. Tarshis&#146;s evidence at trial that he found 
  infection in and treated both ears should have been disbelieved because it was 
  inconsistent with his evidence on discovery and had not been corrected prior 
  to trial. The admissibility of Dr. Tarshis&#146;s evidence was not objected 
  to and although it troubled her, it was accepted by the trial judge. We did 
  not see the witnesses at trial and can intervene only if we find palpable and 
  overriding error. The trial judge explained why she accepted Dr. Tarshis&#146;s 
  evidence at trial and we can see no basis to interfere with her conclusion.</p>
<p>[3] Beyond these two matters, the trial judge&#146;s findings of credibility 
  were all carefully made and in each case well supported by the evidence. The 
  findings against the appellant were made gently and with balance, often drawing 
  on employment records and academic records as well as oral testimony. None of 
  these findings bespeaks palpable error.</p>
<p>[4] Counsel&#146;s second area of attack is on the trial judge&#146;s findings 
  relating to negligence. In essence, he says that the trial judge should have 
  found that Dr. Tarshis breached his standard of care by failing to determine 
  that ototoxicity was causing his patient&#146;s problems by early in the summer 
  of 1991 and certainly before August 13 when he prescribed Garasone for the second 
  time.</p>
<p>[5] In our view, there was simply no expert evidence to support this conclusion. 
  Rather, there was ample evidence that given the symptoms presented by the appellant, 
  her recent history of infections in both ears and the unlikelihood that ototoxicity 
  was causing her problems, Dr. Tarshis did not fall below the required standard 
  of care in prescribing Garasone on August 13 and August 19, 1991.</p>
<p>[6] Counsel&#146;s final area of attack is that of causation. He challenges 
  the trial judge&#146;s finding that the irreversible damage had been done by 
  September 5, 1991 when the appellant was admitted to hospital. However, the 
  appellant&#146;s own expert confirmed this position. There was simply no evidence 
  of any meaningful possibility of recovery as of September 5, 1991.</p>
<p>[7] Regrettably therefore, given the appellant&#146;s medical condition, the 
  appeal on liability must be dismissed. </p>
<p>[8] As to the costs awarded at trial, we think that the trial judge erred in 
  not giving effect to the respondent&#146;s change in explanation from discovery 
  to trial. This change was on a significant issue. Moreover, the conduct of the 
  respondent did attract negative comment at various points throughout the trial 
  judgment. In our view, this as well warranted being reflected in the costs award. 
  We would therefore grant leave to appeal the costs award at trial, set aside 
  the costs award and substitute an order that awarded the respondent only his 
  disbursements below together with G.S.T.</p>
<p>[9] We would not award any costs on the appeal.</p>
