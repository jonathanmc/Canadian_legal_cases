<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice N. Douglas Coo of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 19, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The trial judge's determination turned on his assessment of the credibility 
  of the respondent and his assessment of the competing evidence of the experts. 
  He chose to believe the respondent and gave reasons for so doing. He preferred 
  the evidence of the expert called by the respondent and, again, gave reasons 
  for so doing. We see no basis upon which to interfere with those determinations. 
  </p> <P>
  [2] With respect to the appeal against costs, we begin by noting that in general, 
  beneficiaries and putative beneficiaries are entitled to receive an accounting 
  of an estate's assets. If an administrator fails to provide such an accounting, 
  the putative beneficiary is entitled to the court's assistance in obtaining 
  such an accounting. The costs of such proceedings are generally borne by the 
  estate.</p> <P>
  [3] In this case, the trial of an issue was necessary to resolve questions about 
  the administration of the estate because the estate had not been fully administered. 
  It may be that there were good reasons for not fully administering the estate 
  but, in the circumstances, the costs of providing the beneficiary with an accounting 
  -- which the beneficiary has a right to -- should be borne by the estate.</p> <P>
  [4] Leave to appeal the order as to costs is granted. The costs order is set 
  aside and an order shall go requiring the estate to pay the appellant's reasonable 
  legal costs, on a solicitor-and-client basis, of the trial of an issue before 
  Coo J.</p> <P>
  [5] Success on the appeal being divided, there shall be no order as to costs 
  of the appeal.</p>
