<p class="center">Released Orally: June 12, 2003<br>
</p>
<p>[1] In our opinion the trial judge did not commit any palpable and overriding 
  error with respect to the facts and he applied the law correctly. The trial 
  judge found that the will was not the product of undue influence. The evidence 
  of the solicitor who prepared the will supports that finding. In addition there 
  is no evidence the testator was under any infirmity or illness and a period 
  of ten years elapsed after the will was made. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] We would dismiss the appeal. We would direct that the costs of the appeal 
  be paid by the appellant to the estate on a party and party basis to be assessed 
  together with the costs awarded to the appellant for the trial.</p>
