<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The conviction appeal was not pursued and is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [2] The sentencing judge gave detailed reasons for the sentence he imposed. 
  With one minor exception we see no error in these reasons. The one exception 
  relates to the appellant's pre?trial custody. When the appellant was arrested 
  on these charges he began serving the remnant of his prior sentence. Instead 
  of returning to Collins Bay, however, the appellant was incarcerated at the 
  Toronto East Detention Centre for approximately one year while his preliminary 
  inquiry took place. </p>
<p>
  [3] The sentencing judge may have been inadvertently misled as he was initially 
  advised that the appellant had spent little time at Toronto East but had been 
  returned to Collins Bay. He gave no credit to the appellant for any pre?trial 
  custody having determined that it was due to revocation of parole. </p>
<p>
  [4] Having regard to what actually happened the appellant ought to have received 
  credit for one year pre?trial custody: see R. v. Warren (Ont. C.A.) Nov 25, 
  1999. We would not otherwise interfere with the totality of the sentence. </p>
<p> [5] Accordingly, we grant leave to appeal sentence and reduce the sentence 
  by one year for a sentence of 12 years consecutive.</p>
