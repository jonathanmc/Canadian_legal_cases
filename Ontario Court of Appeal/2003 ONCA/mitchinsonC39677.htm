<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] It is common ground that physicians are not &quot;employees&quot; of the 
  provincial government. In our view, however, in reaching the conclusion they 
  did, the Assistant Information and Privacy Commissioner and the Divisional Court 
  read the phrase &quot;labour relations&quot; in s. 65(6)3 of the Freedom of 
  Information and Protection of Privacy Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.31 (&quot;the Act&quot;), 
  too narrowly. The phrase is not defined in that Act, and its ordinary meaning 
  can extend to relations and conditions of work beyond those relating to collective 
  bargaining. Nor is there any reason to restrict the meaning of &quot;labour 
  relations&quot; to employer/employee relationships; to do so would render the 
  phrase &quot;employment-related matters&quot; redundant. </p>
<p>
  [2] The relationship between the government and physicians, and the work of 
  the Physician Services Committee in discharging its mandate on their behalf, 
  including provisions for the remuneration of physicians, fall within the phrase 
  &quot;labour relations&quot;, and the meetings, consultations, discussions and 
  communications that take place in the discharge of that mandate fall within 
  that phrase as it appears in s. 65(6)3. The result is that the Act does not 
  apply to the records the production of which was ordered by the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appeal is allowed, the order of the Divisional Court is set aside and 
  the appellant's application for judicial review is granted. The appellant does 
  not request costs, and we award none. </p>
