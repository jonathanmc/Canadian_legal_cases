<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Douglas Coo of the Superior Court of 
  Justice, sitting with a jury, dated December 27, 2001.</p>
<p>CRONK J.A.:</p>
<p>A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] This appeal concerns the adequacy of a trial judge's jury instruction on 
  contributory causation for damages in a civil action arising from a motor vehicle 
  accident. If the instruction was inadequate, a second issue also arises, namely, 
  the consequences of the instruction given the evidentiary record and the nature 
  of the jury's verdict in this case. </p>
<p> [2] The appellant, Velda Mizzi, was injured in a motor vehicle accident on 
  April 13, 1997, when her vehicle was struck from behind by the respondents' 
  vehicle, causing the appellant to strike her head on her car interior. She sustained 
  a cut to her scalp. She did not lose consciousness. She was taken to a hospital 
  to receive stitches for her scalp injury. In the ambulance en route to the hospital, 
  her level of consciousness was tested. Her test score was then only slightly 
  below normal. Subsequently, she achieved perfect scores at the hospital on identical 
  repeat tests. She was released from the hospital after approximately two hours, 
  with medication for pain and advice on how to deal with head injuries and any 
  symptoms of post-concussive syndrome. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant was 41 years of age at the time of the accident. Prior to 
  the accident she was self-employed as a freelance hair and makeup artist in 
  the advertising and film production industries. She claimed at trial that she 
  suffered significant neurological, psychological, and physical injuries as a 
  result of the accident, including depression, unreliable short-term and long-term 
  memory, constant headaches, decreased organiza-tional and concentration capacities, 
  unsteadiness, and neck and back pain, which prevented her from resuming her 
  pre-accident employment. In support of that claim, she relied on extensive medical 
  evidence and the testimony of several non-expert witnesses who observed changes 
  in her health, behaviour and personality following the accident. At trial, liability 
  was admitted. A jury trial took place in November 2001 solely on the issue of 
  damages.</p>
<p>
  [4] The defence advanced two theories at trial. First, the respondents claimed 
  that the appellant did not suffer a brain injury in the accident at all, and 
  that her post-accident complaints, and any on-going inability to return to work, 
  were caused by conditions which existed, or incidents which occurred, prior 
  to the accident. In the alternative, they asserted that the appellant sustained 
  only a mild head injury in the accident, and that although the accident may 
  have caused a temporary or transient increase in the effects of the appellant's 
  pre-accident condition, they had returned to pre-accident levels well before 
  the trial. The defence relied on Ms. Mizzi's own testimony, that of the medical 
  witnesses called on her behalf, a medical report by a neurologist, and the testimony 
  of a psychiatrist who was called as a witness at trial on behalf of the respondents.</p>
<p>
  [5] The jury awarded the appellant $30,000 for general damages and $48,000 for 
  lost income in 1997 to 1999, but nothing in damages for lost income in 2000 
  and 2001 or for future loss of income. On December 27, 2001, Coo J. awarded 
  the appellant judgment for damages, net of applicable deductibles, in accordance 
  with the jury's verdict. The appellant appeals on the basis that the trial judge 
  failed to adequately instruct the jury on the legal principles enunciated by 
  the Supreme Court of Canada in Athey v. Leonati (1996), 140 D.L.R. (4th) 235 
  concerning contributory causation for damages.</p>
<p>
  [6] I have concluded that although the trial judge erred in his instruction 
  on contributory causation, the instruction occasioned no substantial wrong or 
  miscarriage of justice given the evidence in this case and the nature of the 
  jury's verdict. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  B. ISSUES AND POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant argues that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the 
  jury that she was entitled in law to full compensation from the respondents 
  for her overall condition following the accident if the jury was satisfied that 
  her condition was the cumulative result of both her pre-existing condition and 
  the accident, and that the accident materially contributed to her overall post-accident 
  condition. The appellant further submits, in that context, that the trial judge 
  erred by failing to instruct the jury that a &quot;material contribution&quot; 
  is a contribution which is not &quot;de minimis&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [8] The respondents assert that the trial judge's jury instruction on contributory 
  causation properly outlined the applicable legal principles established in Athey 
  v. Leonati. They also submit, if the instruction suffered from any deficiency 
  in that regard, that it raises no reasonable possibility of a substantial miscarriage 
  of justice, thereby precluding appellate interference with the jury's verdict.</p>
<p>
  [9] The respondents also maintain that because the jury's assessment of damages 
  is supported by the evidence there is no basis upon which to interfere with 
  it. They argue that the appellant's medical records reveal a pre-accident history 
  of serious health problems, and that the appellant's claims concerning her post-accident 
  injuries are not credible. Alternatively, they submit that, although the appellant 
  suffered some temporary and minor soft-tissue injuries as a result of the accident, 
  those injuries resolved by about 1999 and, either unconsciously or consciously, 
  she exaggerated her injuries. It is their position that the jury, by its award 
  of general damages and special damages only up to 1999, accepted the defence 
  position that the appellant had sustained only a moderately severe injury in 
  the accident, the effects of which resolved within a few years.</p>
<p>
  C. ADDITIONAL FACTS</p>
<p>
  (1) The Medical Evidence</p>
<p>
  [10] The medical evidence at trial, consisting of various medical reports filed 
  on consent as exhibits and the oral testimony of four physicians, established 
  that the appellant's pre-accident medical history included:</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) a broken ankle, which ultimately required surgery, and 
  back pain occasioned by a motor vehicle accident in November 1989;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) at least two head injuries prior to the accident, resulting 
  from a slip and fall on ice in December 1995, and a physical assault in January 
  or February 1996, when the appellant was rendered unconscious by a kick to her 
  head;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) counselling on various occasions during the period November 
  1989 to May 1996, for: emotional stress arising from a pregnancy and abortion 
  (November 1989); use of alcohol and drugs (November 1989); insomnia, nervousness 
  and stress (February 1990); tension headache that the appellant feared was caused 
  by a brain tumour (April 1991); stress related to a second pregnancy and abortion 
  (October 1991); situational (short-term) anxiety related to the termination 
  of her relationship with her boyfriend (January 1993); and depression and anxiety 
  arising from the assault which she suffered (May 1996); and</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) in May 1996, a diagnosis by a consulting physician of depression 
  and suspected chemical imbalance.</p>
<p>
  [11] The appellant's family physician, Dr. Kenneth Chen, saw the appellant eight 
  days after the accident. He diagnosed soft tissue injuries to the appellant's 
  neck and upper back, a laceration of her scalp, headache, confusion, fatigue 
  and post-traumatic concussion. He arranged for a brain scan in late April 1997, 
  and also referred the appellant to Dr. P. G. Urback, a specialist in internal 
  medicine. The brain scan results showed no evidence of brain damage. Dr. Urback 
  concluded that the appellant was likely suffering from a post-concussive syndrome. 
  He was unable to identify &quot;any objective evidence of central nervous system 
  damage&quot;, and felt that the appellant had &quot;a pretty good prognosis&quot; 
  but that she required an urgent neurological consultation. The consulting neurologist 
  subsequently reported that although the appellant may have sustained a concussion, 
  she did not suffer any residual neurological effects from the accident.</p>
<p>
  [12] Dr. Chen continued to treat the appellant after the accident, until trial. 
  At various times he noted that she suffered from depression, headache, decreased 
  memory, unsteadiness, soft tissue pain of the neck and back and, on some occasions, 
  symptoms of paranoia. His initial diagnosis of post-traumatic concussion remained 
  unchanged. In his view, the appellant's condition had improved by 1999, although 
  she continued to experience lower back pain and decreased memory, social skills, 
  conversational abilities, attention, concentration, and ability to plan or organize. 
  She walked with a cane, although its use had not been prescribed. He was unable 
  to say when the appellant would fully recover.</p>
<p>
  [13] In the years 1997 to 2000, the appellant was seen by a plethora of medical 
  specialists, sometimes for treatment and other times for the assessment or evaluation 
  of her condition. Several of those experts gave evidence at trial. The reports 
  of others were filed as exhibits. In my view, for the purpose of this appeal, 
  it is necessary to detail only certain key opinion evidence including, in particular, 
  the testimony of Dr. Chanth Seyone, on behalf of the appellant, and Dr. Lawrence 
  Reznek, on behalf of the respondents. In summary, their evidence was conflicting 
  and depicted significantly different pictures of the appellant's post-accident 
  condition. Indeed, their evidence reflected what the trial judge described as 
  the &quot;extremes in this case&quot;. As he observed, this was not a narrow 
  case on damages, in which the positions and evidence of the parties were only 
  marginally different.</p>
<p>
  [14] The report of Dr. Jeffrey Price, a psychologist, was filed at trial on 
  behalf of the appellant. Dr. Price saw the appellant in March 1998, almost one 
  year after the accident, for an assessment of her psychological functioning. 
  He reported that she was experiencing major depression, generalized anxiety 
  disorder, and chronic pain disorder as a consequence of the accident. In his 
  opinion, the appellant had &quot;substantial predisposing and underlying psychological 
  conditions&quot; which had been exacerbated by the trauma of the accident. He 
  did not suggest that the appellant had sustained a brain injury in the accident. 
  He expressed the view that the appellant's cognitive functioning likely would 
  improve as her psychological and emotional distress receded.</p>
<p> [15] Dr. Chanth Seyone is both a psychiatrist and a neuropsychiatrist<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a>, 
  and the director of a brain injury clinic at a major Toronto teaching hospital. 
  He saw the appellant six times between June 2000 and October 2001. He testified 
  that the appellant was &quot;one of [his] more difficult challenges&quot;, in 
  the sense that, when he initially saw her, she was very disorganized. It was 
  &quot;almost impossible to get a coherent history from her&quot;, and there 
  was no logical co-ordination between her thoughts.</p>
<p>
  [16] Dr. Seyone conducted a neuropsychiatric assessment of the appellant. He 
  described her as being &quot;almost psychotic&quot; in a number of ways, and 
  her thought content as being delusional. He initially made several differential 
  diagnoses, but ultimately concluded that the appellant had a bipolar affective 
  disorder, that is, a manic-depressive illness characterized by excessive highs 
  and lows in mood. In Dr. Seyone's view, although that diagnosis need not depend 
  on the presence of a brain injury, the appellant's condition &quot;possibly&quot; 
  involved a &quot;minimal&quot; brain injury sustained at the time of the accident. 
  Dr. Seyone indicated that loss of consciousness is not a precondition to a mild 
  brain injury, and that such an injury could have occurred although testing of 
  the appellant revealed no objective evidence of a brain injury.</p>
<p>
  [17] In Dr. Seyone's opinion, the appellant's symptoms were temporally related 
  to the accident, which triggered the appellant's &quot;complete decompensation&quot; 
  to the point &quot;[w]]here she was presenting&#133;as somebody who basically 
  couldn't even maintain regular activity of daily living, far less kind of go 
  to work and earn a living and pay rent and everything else that she was doing 
  before.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [18] By June or July 2000, however, it was Dr. Seyone's opinion that the appellant 
  had improved and &quot;a lot of things [had] settled down to a large extent, 
  and she's actually better now than she was then.&quot; By the end of November 
  2000, her improvement had further progressed; however, she was still delusional 
  and Dr. Seyone prescribed anti-psychotic medications.</p>
<p>
  [19] Dr. Peter Stenn, a psychiatrist and a psychologist, also testified for 
  the appellant at trial. He treated her for depression, following a referral 
  by Dr. Chen. He saw the appellant approximately twenty times from September 
  1997 to September 1999. He diagnosed her as suffering from depression and &quot;possibly&quot; 
  a post-concussive syndrome. According to Dr. Stenn, some patients recover &quot;fairly 
  quickly&quot; from the syndrome. In other patients, the syndrome persists for 
  a &quot;fairly long time&quot;. He did not arrive at a prognosis for the appellant. 
  Moreover, given the correlation in time between the date of the accident and 
  the appellant's condition when he first saw her, he simply assumed that her 
  condition was causally related to the accident.</p>
<p>
  [20] The report of Dr. Adrien Upton, a neurologist, was filed at trial on behalf 
  of the respondents. Dr. Upton saw the appellant in August 1999. He reported 
  that the appellant had a long history of depression, anxiety, and other trauma 
  prior to the 1997 motor vehicle accident. In his view, the appellant had no 
  organic neurological abnormality or evidence of any residual effect of a head 
  injury. He expressed the opinion that the appellant's problems were psychological 
  or psychiatric in origin, and &quot;at most she had a very mild concussion&quot;. 
  He suggested that treatment of the appellant's &quot;long-standing personality, 
  psychological or psychiatric problems will be difficult in view of [her] pre-accident 
  pattern of problems&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [21] Strong reliance was placed by the defence on the trial testimony of Dr. 
  Reznek, a psychiatrist who assessed the appellant on behalf of the respondents 
  for two hours on one occasion in May 2000. He testified that while he could 
  not wholly exclude the possibility that the appellant suffered a mild traumatic 
  head injury in the accident, if there was a head injury it was &quot;very, very 
  mild.&quot; He based that opinion on the symptoms exhibited by the appellant 
  in the hospital emergency department immediately after the accident and on his 
  own testing and observations of her. In particular, in his view, the emergency 
  department records indicated that the appellant was then fully conscious and 
  orientated, her brain was functioning normally, there was no evidence of a significant 
  period of post-traumatic amnesia or depressed consciousness, and testing generated 
  no evidence of organic brain injury (that is, objectively detectable brain damage). 
  Dr. Reznek's own testing and observations of the appellant indicated no evidence 
  of depression, anxiety, a manic illness, psychotic symptoms, cognitive deficits 
  (including deficits in short-term memory, concentration or verbal comprehension), 
  or symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>
  [22] On cross-examination, Dr. Reznek acknowledged that the appellant's description 
  of her gaps in memory immediately following the accident was consistent with 
  symptoms of post-traumatic amnesia. He also confirmed that the appellant had 
  a &quot;fairly fragile personality structure&quot; before the accident, which 
  caused her to be easily stressed by events, in turn leading to anxiety and depression 
  in reaction to the stress. In his view, the appellant's behaviour after the 
  accident did not suggest malingering but, rather, a genuine - and for her - 
  a usual reaction to stress. </p>
<p>
  [23] In May 2000, the appellant was referred to a rehabilitation hospital for 
  treatment, where she was seen by a team of specialists. The reviewing psychiatrist 
  concluded that the appellant's presentation had a &quot;significant psychological 
  overlay&quot;, she suffered &quot;at the most a mild to moderate concussion&quot;, 
  and had no focal neurological findings. A brain MRI test was recommended to 
  verify any brain injury, but it does not appear to have been performed at that 
  time.</p>
<p>
  (2) The Appellant's Pre-Accident Work History</p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant's evidence at trial established that her work on hair and 
  makeup was excellent, she was an integral part of the creative team on various 
  photography shoots, and she participated prior to the accident in several high 
  profile photography shoots involving celebrities or other noted public figures. 
  The appellant claimed that, before the accident, she loved her work and was 
  employed on a steady basis.</p>
<p>
  [25] Various tax records and accounting summaries were admitted at trial as 
  exhibits. Those records indicate that the appellant's declared gross income 
  for the years 1994, 1995, and 1996 was $14,200, $8,312 and $18,000, respectively. 
  Her net income before taxes for the same years was $7,190, $3,810, and $14,023, 
  yielding an average net income prior to the accident of approximately $8,340 
  per year. The appellant did not file tax returns in 1992 and 1993. </p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) The Governing Principles Concerning Contributory Causation</p>
<p>
  [26] In Athey v. Leonati, the plaintiff was injured in two successive motor 
  vehicle accidents. Thereafter, while he was recovering from those injuries, 
  he experienced a disc herniation while exercising. The trial judge found that 
  the herniation was caused by the combined effect of the injuries that the plaintiff 
  sustained in the accidents and his pre-existing back problems. She apportioned 
  the plaintiff's loss between the tortious (the accidents) and non-tortious (the 
  pre-existing back problems) causes, and awarded the plaintiff damages of 25% 
  of his full loss.</p>
<p>
  [27] Although the plaintiff's appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal 
  was dismissed, his further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was successful. 
  In my view, the judgment of the Supreme Court makes clear that the legal principles 
  concerning contributory causation flow from at least two foundational tort law 
  rules. First, a defendant is liable in tort for all injuries caused or contributed 
  to by his or her negligence. Second, as described by Major J. on behalf of the 
  court (at p. 243):</p>
<p class="indent"> [T]he plaintiff must be placed in the position he or she would 
  have been in absent the defendant's negligence (the &quot;original position&quot;). 
  However, the plaintiff is not to be placed in a position better than his or 
  her original one. It is therefore necessary not only to determine the plaintiff's 
  position after the tort but also to assess what the &quot;original position&quot; 
  would have been. It is the difference between these positions, the &quot;original 
  position&quot; and the &quot;injured position&quot;, which is the plaintiff's 
  loss [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [28] In addition, as relevant to this case, the following causation principles 
  were identified by the court:</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) the defendant's liability is not reduced by the presence 
  of non-tortious contributing causes to the plaintiff's loss, if the defendant's 
  conduct is found to be a cause of the loss. Liability is established if the 
  defendant's conduct is part of the cause of a plaintiff's injury. The plaintiff 
  is not required to establish that the defendant's negligence was the sole cause 
  of the injury;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) however, to ground liability, the defendant's negligent 
  conduct must have &quot;materially contributed&quot; to the occurrence of the 
  plaintiff's injury. As indicated by Major J., at p. 239: &quot;A contributing 
  factor is material if it falls outside the de minimis range&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) separation between injuries and, hence, division of liability 
  among joint tortfeasors or assignment of liability to one tortfeasor for less 
  than 100% of the plaintiff's injuries is permissible where some of the plaintiff's 
  injuries have tortious causes and some do not. That division or assignment, 
  however, is not possible or appropriate where the plaintiff's loss and its consequences, 
  in reality, are one injury;</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) a tortfeasor is liable for the plaintiff's injuries even 
  if the injuries are unexpectedly severe owing to a pre-existing condition (the 
  so-called &quot;thin skull&quot; rule); and </p>
<p class="indent">(v) some limitations apply to curtail the extent of a defendant's 
  liability under the &quot;thin skull&quot; rule. A defendant will not be liable 
  for any debilitating effects of a plaintiff's pre-existing condition if the 
  plaintiff would have experienced those effects anyway, that is, without the 
  occurrence of the defendant's negligent conduct. As observed by Major J., at 
  p. 244: &quot;The defendant is liable for the additional damage but not the 
  pre-existing damage&quot; (the so-called &quot;crumbling skull&quot; rule). 
</p>
<p>
  [29] Major J. also addressed the ramifications, in the Athey v. Leonati case, 
  of the principles which he had outlined (at pp. 245-46):</p>
<p class="indent"> 1. If the disc herniation would likely have occurred at the 
  same time, without the injuries sustained in the accident, then causation is 
  not proven.</p>
<p class="indent">2. If it was necessary to have both the accidents and the pre-existing 
  back condition for the herniation to occur, then causation is proven, since 
  the herniation would not have occurred but for the accidents. Even if the accidents 
  played a minor role, the defendant would be fully liable because the accidents 
  were still a necessary contributing cause.</p>
<p class="indent">3. If the accidents alone could have been a sufficient cause, 
  and the pre-existing back condition alone could have been a sufficient cause, 
  then it is unclear which was the cause-in-fact of the disc herniation. The trial 
  judge must determine, on a balance of probabilities, whether the defendant's 
  negligence materially contributed to the injury [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [30] Athey v. Leonati confirms that once it is proven that a defendant's negligence 
  was a cause of the plaintiff's injury, whether demonstrated directly or by inference 
  of a causal connection, a damages award should not be reduced to recognize the 
  contribution of non-tortious causes to the plaintiff's loss. In establishing 
  that principle, the Supreme Court restated, and affirmed, many basic tort law 
  principles and the earlier judgment of that court in Snell v. Farrell, [1990] 
  2 S.C.R. 311.</p>
<p>
  [31] The principles enunciated in Athey v. Leonati may be applied with relative 
  ease when a plaintiff's injuries are discreet, and clearly attributable to one 
  or more independent tortious or non-tortious occurrences. Often, however, a 
  plaintiff's injuries are not susceptible to such ready or clear-cut division. 
  Rather, as noted by Major J. in Athey v. Leonati at p. 239, a plaintiff's injuries 
  may emanate from &quot;a myriad of other background events [or conditions] which 
  were necessary preconditions&quot; to the occurrence of the injuries in question. 
  In such cases, it is frequently impossible to attribute a single cause to the 
  plaintiff's injuries. For that reason, the Supreme Court has recognized that 
  the traditional test for causation, the &quot;but-for&quot; test, is unworkable 
  in some situations and, in those cases, should be replaced by the &quot;material 
  contribution&quot; test, which is concerned with whether the defendant's negligence 
  &quot;materially contributed&quot; to the occurrence of the plaintiff's injuries: 
  Athey v. Leonati at p. 239 and Walker Estate v. York Finch General Hospital, 
  [2001] 1 S.C.R. 647 at 679-80, per Major J. This case falls within the latter 
  category of cases. </p>
<p>
  [32] How, then, is a trial judge properly to instruct a jury on contributory 
  causation for damages? That question was expressly considered by this court 
  in Alderson v. Callaghan (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 136 (C.A.), a case relied upon 
  by the appellant. The facts in Alderson are similar in some, although not all, 
  respects to the facts of this case. </p>
<p>
  [33] The plaintiff in Alderson claimed to have suffered serious brain damage 
  in a motor vehicle accident. The defendant admitted liability, but asserted 
  that the plaintiff sustained only a mild concussion in the accident, and that 
  her brain damage and personality changes were caused by her pre-accident psychological 
  and emotional conditions and several post-accident assaults. The plaintiff appealed 
  from the jury's verdict awarding damages on the basis that the trial judge had 
  misdirected the jury on contributory causation, a submission which was accepted 
  by this court. In allowing the plaintiff's appeal, Moldaver J.A. stated at p. 
  139:</p>
<p class="indent"> In light of Athey, supra, the jury should have been told that 
  if Alderson's overall condition resulted from the cumulative effect of the injuries 
  sustained in the August 10 accident, the multiple beatings inflicted upon her 
  thereafter, and her pre-existing psychological condition, she would nonetheless 
  be entitled to full compensation so long as the jury was satisfied, on a balance 
  of probabilities, that the injuries sustained in the August 10 accident materially 
  contributed to her overall condition. The jury should then have been told that 
  if they were not so satisfied, they should assess the plaintiff's damages based 
  upon the nature and extent of her injuries, which, in their opinion, were directly 
  attributable to the motor vehicle accident.</p>
<p>
  (2) The Content of the Instruction in this Case</p>
<p>
  [34] During the course of the trial, the trial judge invited submissions from 
  counsel concerning his jury charge. Counsel for the respondents (not counsel 
  on this appeal) made no submissions. However, the following exchange took place 
  between the trial judge and the appellant's trial counsel:</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: Is there anything we could do now about what ought 
  to be in the charge&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> MR. FURSMAN: I can at least begin on that if Your Honour wishes 
  me to, or if Your Honour would prefer that we both do [it] at the same time.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: I've been given two cases - - </p>
<p class="indent"> MR. FURSMAN: Yes, that's right [sic]. And Alderson and Callaghan. 
  And from Athey and Leonati, I would ask you to consider instructing the jury 
  with regard to the &quot;thin skull&quot; doctrine at page 243 of the report, 
  and from Alderson and Callaghan, a case not at all dissimilar to this one, the 
  Court of Appeal indicated that the question that should be put to the jury is 
  whether the motor vehicle accident had a - - let me see if I can find the exact 
  words&#133;whether the motor vehicle accident materially contributed to the 
  plaintiff's overall condition, which is at page 139 of the decision in Alderson 
  and Callaghan.</p>
<p class="indent"> There may be some other minor points, but those are the two 
  major issues that I'm going to be asking you to address in your charge.</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: All right, so the thin skull and don't just leave 
  it to the jury that - - may have had some external or contributing effect but 
  did the - - Obviously, I'm not going to ignore the fact that the plaintiff's 
  got to prove her case.</p>
<p class="indent"> MR. FURSMAN: Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: I don't think Justice Moldaver was intending to 
  say otherwise. The plaintiff has said, &quot;I have all these problems, and 
  I do [sic] react.&quot; So she's got to prove it, even if there were no possible 
  alternative cause in a mix of information, the jury could say, &quot;We don't 
  believe it.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent"> But I understand your point.</p>
<p>
  [35] In his jury charge, the trial judge instructed the jury on the applicable 
  legal principles concerning the assessment of credibility and the weighing of 
  evidence. He then reviewed the medical evidence, the appellant's own testimony, 
  and the evidence of the non-expert witnesses concerning the appellant's health, 
  behaviour and personality after the accident. As part of that review, the trial 
  judge provided the jury with a summary of the evidence of Drs. Seyone and Reznek. 
  He then instructed the jury as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> So what do you do with all that? Well, first you've got to 
  decide what the facts were, what happened, what injuries were suffered by the 
  plaintiff and what symptoms developed and how long have they lasted or did they 
  last if some or all of them disappeared.</p>
<p class="indent">It must be borne in mind that if the plaintiff was a vulnerable 
  person, one with a kind of disposition or personality that exposed her to more 
  dramatic bad results from a minor injury than would show in the case of a tougher 
  or more stoic person, that does not mean that the plaintiff is not entitled 
  to damages for what she in fact suffered. The defence is not entitled to take 
  advantage of the fact that she was or is that sort of more delicate person, 
  if that is the conclusion to which you come. And if that is the conclusion to 
  which you come, the defendant is liable for the plaintiff's injuries, even if 
  they turned out to be unexpectedly severe as a result of her pre-existing condition, 
  assuming that the plaintiff establishes that the motor vehicle accident materially 
  contributed to those injuries.</p>
<p>
  [36] Thereafter, the trial judge outlined for the jury the positions of the 
  parties regarding the cause of the appellant's injuries. In that connection, 
  he stated in part:</p>
<p class="indent"> As I understand it, the defence position is that they did not 
  so contribute. The defence position is that the accident neither started nor 
  worsened any of the psychological, psychiatric or emotional problems of which 
  Ms. Mizzi complains and thus did not materially contribute to any of them, except 
  perhaps, although this is not conceded, with regard to some of them for a brief 
  time.</p>
<p class="indent">Plaintiff's counsel has made detailed arguments to you about 
  all this, including that you should find that the plaintiff had and has all 
  the problems of which she spoke. He puts it to you that all this was caused, 
  alternatively, by:</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>a brain injury severe enough to cause all of these problems in a person 
        previously without any of these symptoms, save, for some, on rare and 
        temporary occasions in the past; or<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>a perhaps very mild brain injury, perhaps without any of the ordinary 
        signs of one that might be revealed by testing of any sort, but one that 
        gave mild real symptoms for a while which the plaintiff, not intentionally, 
        but simply as a result of being the sort of person she is, converted into 
        ongoing symptoms which she thinks are there and are the result of the 
        car accident, superimposed on a fragile personality of the sort described 
        by Dr. Reznek. That is a legitimate way to make the claim, assuming, of 
        course, that you accept that is what happened; and alternatively <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>perhaps no real brain injury at all in a person who was peculiarly vulnerable 
        to such an event and that led, without any exaggeration on the part of 
        the plaintiff, to her being struck with at least some of what she has 
        told you about and which had an affect [sic] on the plaintiff's ability 
        to function and work. That, too, would be a legitimate claim, if you find 
        that is what happened.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
  [37] Later in his charge, when directing the jury on general damages, the trial 
  judge said:</p>
<p class="indent"> The idea of general damages is to compensate the claimant in 
  money for whatever injuries she proves she has suffered. The purpose of general 
  damages is to put the injured party, as far as money can do, in the same position 
  as she would have been in had there been no injury. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Take into account what the claimant has established on the balance 
  of probabilities to be the basic nature of the injuries suffered, the pain and 
  suffering, both emotional and physical, experienced up to the present time, 
  and take into account what there will probably be in the future, and take into 
  account with respect to any injuries which you conclude have been proven on 
  the balance of probabilities to have been suffered, such pain and suffering 
  and loss of amenities of life as to which there is a real possibility for the 
  future - - the same phraseology as with respect to future income: a real possibility 
  for the future, discounting that aspect of damages on the basis of your view 
  as to the extent of that likelihood or real possibility.</p>
<p class="indent">Take into account on the same basis disability suffered in consequence 
  of the injuries.</p>
<p class="indent">Take into account again on the same basis the impact on this 
  plaintiff's life up to now and to the future of loss of general amenities of 
  life, the things she was able to do, liked to do, enjoyed doing, and has not 
  been able to do because of the injuries suffered in the accident [emphasis added]. 
</p>
<p>
  (3) The Adequacy of the Challenged Instruction</p>
<p>
  [38] In his instruction on contributory causation, the trial judge correctly 
  described the &quot;thin skull&quot; rule, as he had been requested to do by 
  the appellant's trial counsel. The appellant does not challenge that aspect 
  of the instruction. The trial judge also directed the jury as to the consequences 
  of the &quot;thin skull&quot; rule if the jury concluded that the respondents' 
  negligent conduct &quot;materially contributed&quot; to the appellant's injuries. 
  Although the appellant complains on this appeal that the trial judge did not 
  go on to tell the jury that a &quot;material&quot; contribution is one which 
  falls outside the de minimis range, that deficiency, in my view, is not significant 
  in this case. The ordinary meaning and usage of &quot;material&quot; connotes 
  something in excess of trivial or minor. I think it is most unlikely that the 
  jury would have been confused by the failure to explain &quot;materiality&quot; 
  in the context of the trial judge's causation instruction.</p>
<p>
  [39] Subsequently, in his direction on general damages, the trial judge also 
  properly and clearly set out the basic compensatory purpose of tort law, that 
  is, to put the injured party, as far as can be accomplished with money, in the 
  same position as he or she would have been but for the negligent conduct of 
  the tortfeasor.</p>
<p>
  [40] Unfortunately, however, the trial judge did not refer anywhere in his instruction 
  on contributory causation, or in his direction on general damages, to the appellant's 
  overall post-accident condition. Similarly, he did not refer to a potential 
  cumulative effect from the injuries she sustained in the motor vehicle accident 
  and her pre-accident condition, or to the requirement that the respondents be 
  held liable for the appellant's full loss if the jury concluded that her overall 
  post-accident condition resulted from such a cumulative effect. In those important 
  aspects, the trial judge's causation instruction did not conform with this court's 
  decision in Alderson v. Callaghan and, in my view, did not contain the complete 
  requirements of an Athey v. Leonati instruction. It is important to recall in 
  that regard, that the appellant's trial counsel specifically requested that 
  the jury charge include the direction provided in Alderson v. Callaghan, and 
  provided a copy of that decision to the court for that purpose.</p>
<p>
  [41] Instead, the trial judge commenced his causation instruction by directing 
  the jury that it should first determine the facts concerning &quot;what injuries 
  were suffered by the plaintiff and what symptoms developed&quot; and their duration. 
  While that instruction is unobjectionable, the trial judge did not invite the 
  jury to also consider and determine the appellant's original position - her 
  pre-accident condition - and to compare that original position to the facts 
  of her post-accident condition as the jury found them. Moreover, and importantly, 
  at no point in his causation instruction or in his subsequent direction on general 
  damages, did the trial judge explain what he meant by his references to the 
  appellant's &quot;injuries&quot;. It is useful to repeat the following words 
  of the trial judge:</p>
<p class="indent"> And if that is the conclusion to which you come, the defendant 
  is liable for the plaintiff's injuries, even if they turned out to be unexpectedly 
  severe as a result of her pre-existing condition, assuming that the plaintiff 
  establishes that the motor vehicle accident materially contributed to those 
  injuries [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  The trial judge thus linked the requirement of material contribution to the 
  appellant's &quot;injuries&quot; rather than to her &quot;overall condition&quot;. 
  </p>
<p>
  [42] The respondents argue that the phrase &quot;the motor vehicle accident 
  materially contributed to those injuries&quot;, must be read as referring to 
  the full panoply of injuries claimed by the appellant because the accident could 
  only &quot;contribute&quot; to something more than the injuries sustained in 
  the accident. In my view, while there is considerable force to that argument, 
  in the absence of an explanation as to what &quot;injuries&quot; meant, the 
  causation instruction lacked clarity on a critical issue. That conclusion is 
  reinforced by the fact that the trial judge failed to explain, anywhere in his 
  charge, the difference between injuries referable only to the accident and those 
  injuries, if any, which resulted from the combined effect of the injuries sustained 
  in the accident and the appellant's pre-accident condition.</p>
<p>
  [43] The appellant argues that the questions posed by the jury in this case 
  suggest that the jury was confused regarding the applicable contributory causation 
  principles. I am not persuaded that the jury's questions, fairly read, bear 
  that interpretation. </p>
<p>
  [44] The jury asked three questions relating to the testimony at trial. They 
  first requested receipt of a copy of the medical reports of Drs. Reznek and 
  Seyone. Trial counsel for the appellant objected to the provision of the reports 
  to the jury, suggesting that &quot;[I]t would be a very substantial injustice 
  to the plaintiff to have [Dr. Reznek's report] now go before the jury without 
  cross-examination.&quot; The respondents' trial counsel did not object. The 
  trial judge accepted the appellant's position and declined to provide either 
  report to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [45] Shortly thereafter, the jury inquired whether it could examine the transcripts 
  of the evidence of Drs. Reznek and Seyone. The transcripts were not available 
  and could not readily be produced. Further, reading back the entirety of the 
  testimony of both witnesses to the jury would be time-consuming and not easily 
  accomplished based on the state of the court reporter's notes. Accordingly, 
  the trial judge suggested that the jury be invited to narrow the scope of its 
  inquiry, and to consider the helpfulness of having the trial judge review for 
  the jury his notes of the evidence of both witnesses. Counsel for the parties 
  both recognized that production of the transcripts was unrealistic in the circumstances, 
  and that having the court reporter read back the evidence of the two witnesses 
  to the jury would require substantial time. Trial counsel for the appellant 
  indicated that he had &quot;[no] problem&quot; with the trial judge's proposal 
  to read his notes of the evidence to the jury, and said that it was &quot;certainly&#133;preferable 
  to waiting for a transcript to be available.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [46] The jurors then retired to consider the trial judge's suggestions and to 
  have dinner. Upon their return, they requested that the trial judge provide 
  information to them from the evidence of Drs. Reznek and Seyone concerning &quot;prognosis, 
  specifically any estimates of recovery time from [sic] psychosis relating to 
  the specific car accident.&quot; The trial judge then read to the jury his notes 
  from the witnesses' evidence concerning the appellant's prognosis.</p>
<p>
  [47] The appellant does not argue that the trial judge's responses to the jury's 
  questions were inappropriate in the circumstances, or that the trial judge failed 
  in his duty to assist the jurors. In that respect, this case is distinguishable 
  from R. v. Toms, [2003] O.J. No. 952 (C.A.). Rather, the appellant submits that 
  the nature of the jurors' questions signifies that they were struggling to recall 
  critical evidence given by two key medical witnesses, Drs. Seyone and Reznek. 
  I agree. That does not mean, however, that the jury had improperly restricted 
  the scope of its consideration of the evidence, or otherwise misconstrued its 
  task. </p>
<p>
  [48] The third question posed by the jurors clearly indicates that they were 
  focusing their attention at that stage of their deliberations on the prognosis 
  for the appellant's recovery from the injuries sustained by her following the 
  motor vehicle accident. That inquiry does not signify that the jurors also failed 
  to consider, and take into account, the evidence regarding exacerbation by the 
  accident of the appellant's pre-existing condition. To the contrary, the juror's 
  third question sought information concerning the appellant's prognosis for recovery 
  from psychosis &quot;relating to&quot; the accident. That terminology, I think, 
  clearly indicates that the jurors were not restricting their consideration of 
  the evidence to only those injuries sustained in the accident.</p>
<p>
  [49] The appellant also argues that the jury's award of general damages should 
  be viewed as a conclusion by the jury that the motor vehicle accident materially 
  contributed to the appellant's losses. I agree that the general damages award, 
  viewed reasonably, is tantamount to a finding by the jury that the accident 
  materially contributed to the appellant's post-accident injuries. That finding 
  was available to the jury on the evidence. Consequently, it was incumbent on 
  the trial judge to instruct the jurors in accordance with Alderson v. Callaghan 
  that the appellant was entitled, under the principles identified in Athey v. 
  Leonati, to full compensation for her overall post-accident condition - and 
  not just for the discreet injury or injuries sustained in the accident - if 
  they concluded that it was the result of both the accident and her pre-accident 
  condition and so long as they also concluded, as in my view they ultimately 
  did, that the accident materially contributed to her injuries. That instruction 
  was not given. Accordingly, with respect, I conclude that the trial judge failed 
  to provide an adequate instruction on contributory causation.</p>
<p>
  (4) The Consequences of the Inadequate Instruction</p>
<p>
  [50] The respondents make two arguments in support of their submission that 
  this court should not interfere with the jury's assessment of damages, notwithstanding 
  any defect in the trial judge's contributory causation instruction. First, they 
  correctly submit that the failure of the appellant's counsel at trial to specifically 
  object to that instruction weighs against appellate intervention. However, where, 
  as here, the faulty instruction bears directly on the jury's central task, the 
  failure by counsel to object cannot save an otherwise objectionable jury instruction. 
  Accordingly, this argument is not determinative.</p>
<p>
  [51] In addition, having regard to the applicable standard of appellate review 
  of a jury verdict in a negligence case, the respondents argue that interference 
  with the jury's verdict is precluded because it is amply supported by the evidence 
  and, hence, is not unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  [52] The applicable standard of review is well-established. As stated by a majority 
  of the Supreme Court of Canada in Housen v. Nikolaisen (2002), 211 D.L.R. (4th) 
  577 at 593, per Iacobucci and Major JJ., courts accord great deference to a 
  jury's findings in civil negligence proceedings. The verdict of a jury will 
  not be set aside as against the weight of evidence unless it is so plainly unreasonable 
  and unjust as to satisfy the court that no jury, reviewing the evidence as a 
  whole and acting judicially, could have reached it: McCannell v. McLean, [1937] 
  S.C.R. 341 at 343. See also Woelk v. Halvorson (1980), 114 D.L.R. (3d) 385 at 
  388-89 (S.C.C.); Vancouver-Fraser Park District v. Olmstead (1975), 51 D.L.R. 
  (3d) 416 at 419-21 (S.C.C.); and Koukounakis v. Stainrod (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 
  299 (C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [53] I agree with the respondents' submissions that the jury's verdict is not 
  un-reasonable and that it is firmly grounded in the evidence. Further, in my 
  view, while the trial judge's instruction on contributory causation was inadequate, 
  I am satisfied that it occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice 
  in this case. I reach that conclusion for several reasons.</p>
<p>
  [54] As I have already mentioned, I believe that the jury's award of general 
  damages indicates that it found that the accident materially contributed to 
  the appellant's post-accident condition. In that respect, the appellant discharged 
  her burden of proving causation. It was also her obligation at trial, however, 
  to prove the nature, extent and duration of the post-accident condition that 
  she claimed resulted from the accident or, alternatively, from the combined 
  effect of the accident and her pre-accident condition.</p>
<p>
  [55] The trial judge was clearly mindful of that aspect of the appellant's burden, 
  as appears from his observation to counsel during their pre-charge discussion 
  with him that: &quot;Obviously, I'm not going to ignore the fact that the plaintiff's 
  got to prove her case&#133;The plaintiff has said, 'I have all these problems, 
  and I do [sic] react.' So she's got to prove it, even if there were no possible 
  alternative cause in a mix of information, the jury could say, 'We don't believe 
  it' &quot;. The trial judge subsequently instructed the jury:</p>
<p class="indent"> Well, first you've got to decide what the facts were, what 
  happened, what injuries were suffered by the plaintiff and what symptoms developed 
  and how long have they lasted or did they last if some or all of them disappeared.</p>
<p>
  That part of the trial judge's instruction properly acknowledged the jury's 
  fact-finding responsibility and directed the jurors' attention to the evidence 
  concerning the appellant's overall post-accident condition. It also indirectly 
  underscored the importance of assessing the credibility of the appellant, which 
  was a central issue at trial.</p>
<p>
  [56] It is useful to reiterate in that connection that the primary defence theory 
  at trial, supported by the evidence of Dr. Reznek, was that the appellant had 
  not suffered the claimed post-accident injuries at all. That position was maintained 
  on this appeal: the respondents continued to argue in their factum that the 
  jury was entitled to conclude that the appellant's post-accident complaints 
  were &quot;made up of whole cloth&quot; and their existence, and the appellant's 
  credibility, were suspect. The jury's award of $30,000 for general damages and 
  $48,000 for past lost income up to 1999 was a rejection of the primary defence 
  theory.</p>
<p>
  [57] The respondents' alternative defence theory, however, was that the appellant's 
  injuries following the 1997 accident were minor and short-lived, had been exaggerated 
  by the appellant, and had resolved sometime in 1999. That theory also necessitated 
  an assessment of the appellant's credibility. The jury's award of special damages 
  for past lost income up to 1999 indicates that it accepted the evidence of significant 
  improvement in the appellant's condition by about 1999. It was open to the jury, 
  having found that the accident materially contributed to the appellant's loss, 
  to accept the alternative defence theory and to conclude, on the whole of the 
  evidence and as urged by the respondents, that the appellant, in fact, had sustained 
  only a moderately severe injury in the accident, the overall effects of which 
  resolved within a few years.</p>
<p>
  [58] In my view, an award of special damages only up to 1999, and not for the 
  ensuing years, was a finding by the jury that the appellant's capacity to earn 
  income, while diminished by the respondents' negligent conduct, was restored 
  by about 1999 such that she was thereafter able to return to work. That finding 
  was open to the jury on the medical evidence in this case, including the evidence 
  of the appellant's own experts, Drs. Chen, Seyone and Price, and the evidence 
  of the respondents' experts, Drs. Upton and Reznek. </p>
<p>
  [59] Given that medical evidence, I am unable to conclude that no jury, reviewing 
  the evidence as a whole and acting judicially, could have reached the same conclusion 
  as that reached by the jury in this case. To the contrary, although the trial 
  judge's contributory causation instruction could, and should, have been more 
  comprehensive and specific, when the jury's general and special damages awards 
  are considered in combination, and in the context of the medical evidence in 
  this case, it is apparent that the jury found that the accident materially contributed 
  to the appellant's post-accident condition and that it awarded damages for the 
  duration of the appellant's overall condition related in any way to the accident. 
  That approach by the jury to its task satisfied the contributory causation and 
  related compensatory principles identified in Athey v. Leonati.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [60] In the result, for the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed. The respondents 
  are entitled to their costs of the appeal, if requested, on a partial indemnity 
  basis, fixed in the amount of $13,500, inclusive of disbursements and Goods 
  and Services Tax. </p>
