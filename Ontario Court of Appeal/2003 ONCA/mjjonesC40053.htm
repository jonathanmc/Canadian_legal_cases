<p>SHARPE J.A.:</p>
<p>
  [1] This motion to quash the defendant's appeal to this court raises the issue 
  whether an order dismissing a motion to dismiss or stay an action on the ground 
  that the Superior Court lacks jurisdiction over out of province defendants or 
  on the ground of forum non conveniens, is final or interlocutory for the purposes 
  of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [2] In the Superior Court, the defendants (appellants in this appeal) Garan, 
  Lucklow, Miller, P.C. and Thomas W. Emery, unsuccessfully moved before Speigel 
  J. for an order </p>
<p>
  (i) setting aside service outside Ontario of the statement of claim and the 
  crossclaims of the defendants Kingsway General Insurance Company (Kingsway) 
  and Donald Fish and D.E. Fish &amp; Associates Ltd.;</p>
<p>
  (ii) dismissing or staying the claim and crossclaims on the ground that the 
  Superior Court of Justice lacks jurisdiction against parties not resident in 
  Ontario; or</p>
<p>
  (iii) alternatively, staying the claims and crossclaims on the ground of forum 
  non conveniens.</p>
<p>
  [3] Those defendants appeal the motions judge's order to this court. In response, 
  Kingsway, supported by the plaintiffs, moves to quash the appeal on the ground 
  that the order appealed from is interlocutory rather than final and that any 
  appeal properly lies to the Divisional Court, with leave, pursuant to the Courts 
  of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, ss. 6(1)(b) and 19(1)(b).</p>
<p>
  [4] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the order appealed from is 
  final in nature and that the motion to quash must be dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [5] The moving parties rely on Nantais v. Telectronics Proprietary (Canada) 
  Ltd., [1996] O.J. No. 1220 (C.A.) where this court quashed an appeal from an 
  order dismissing a motion to set aside service ex juris and to stay or dismiss 
  the action. However, the question before me is not explicitly dealt with in 
  Nantais because that issue was not the focus of the motion to quash. At para. 
  2 of its endorsement the court stated: &quot;The question of forum was not at 
  issue on the appeal, and not aggressively pressed on the motion. The only issue 
  was whether the pleadings identify a cause of action against the appellant.&quot; 
  Since the court in Nantais did not decide the appeal on the jurisdiction issue, 
  authority of Nantais is clearly attenuated on that point.</p>
<p>
  [6] In earlier years, it would seem to have been common practice to consider 
  such orders to be interlocutory in nature since appeals were routinely taken, 
  in the first instance, to the Divisional Court: see Singh v. Howden Petroleum 
  Ltd. (1979), 24 O.R. (2d) 769 (C.A.); Poirier v. Williston (1981), 31 O.R. (2d) 
  320 (C.A.). However, in recent years, following the regime for jurisdiction 
  over out of province defendants established in Morguard Investments Ltd. v. 
  DeSavoye, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077, appeals to this court from orders dismissing 
  jurisdictional challenges have proceeded without any question being raised that 
  such an order is final: see McNichol Estate v. Woldnik (2001), 150 O.A.C. 68; 
  Muscutt v. Courcelles (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 20 (C.A.); compare Lemmex v. Bernard 
  (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 54 (C.A.) where the matter came to this court after an 
  appeal to the Divisional Court. While the reasons for judgment in Noble v. Noble, 
  [2003] O.J. No. 1151 (C.A.) do not explicitly state that such an order is final, 
  the research of the appellant's counsel reveals that the issue was raised in 
  argument. By entertaining the appeal on the merits, the court in Noble appears 
  to have implicitly rejected the contention that the order dismissing the motion 
  to set aside service ex juris and the order dismissing the motion to stay the 
  application because Ontario was not the proper forum was interlocutory.</p>
<p>
  [7] In the absence of explicit authority I turn to analogous cases. Ball v. 
  Donais (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 322 at 324 establishes that even where an order 
  does &quot;not finally dispose of the rights of the parties to the litigation&quot;, 
  it will be final for the purposes of appeal if it conclusively disposes of an 
  issue raised by way of defence and &quot;thereby deprive[s] the defendant of 
  a substantive right which could be determinative of the entire action&quot;. 
  The issue on this appeal is whether or not the order under appeal here has that 
  effect in law.</p>
<p>
  [8] Abbot v. Collins (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 99 involved an appeal from the dismissal 
  of a motion by the appellant for an order staying the action on the ground that 
  the court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter. The appellants had argued 
  that, under the principles laid down in Weber v. Ontario Hydro, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 
  929, the court lacked jurisdiction since the dispute was governed by a collective 
  agreement and fell within the jurisdiction of the grievance procedure. Morden 
  J.A. held in Abbot that the order was final and that an appeal could be taken 
  to this court pursuant to the Courts of Justice Act, s. 6(1)(b). In coming to 
  his conclusion, Morden J.A. applied Ball v. Donais, supra, holding at 101, that 
  the order was final because it &quot;precludes the defendants hereafter from 
  raising the question of the court's jurisdiction over the subject matter of 
  the application&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [9] The reasoning in Ball and Abbott is echoed in Manos Foods International 
  Inc. v. Coca-Cola Ltd., [1999] O.J. No. 3623 (C.A.). At para. 4, the court in 
  Manos held that,</p>
<p class="indent"> The effect of the order under appeal [dismissing a motion to 
  stay or dismiss paragraph 1(b) of the Statement of Claim] is to preclude the 
  appellants from raising again the issue that the Ontario Court lacks jurisdiction 
  to make a mandatory order of the nature sought in paragraph 1(b). The order 
  under appeal finally disposes of that jurisdictional issue and deprives the 
  appellants of a substantive right that could be determinative in opposing the 
  remedy sought in paragraph 1(b).</p>
<p>
  [10] The moving parties urge us to distinguish Abbot and Manos on the basis 
  that those cases dealt with jurisdiction over the subject of the action, while 
  the order at issue here deals with jurisdiction over the person of the defendants. 
  In my view, this is not a meaningful distinction. Following Morguard Investments 
  Ltd. v. DeSavoye, supra, a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court 
  by an out-of-province defendant rests on a substantive legal right rooted in 
  constitutional principles: see Muscutt v. Courcelles, supra. Morguard held that 
  jurisdiction may only be asserted against a defendant where there is a &quot;real 
  and substantial connection&quot; variously described at para. 45-52 as a connection 
  &quot;between the subject-matter of the action and the territory where the action 
  is brought&quot;, between the jurisdiction and the wrongdoing&quot;, &quot;between 
  the damages suffered and the jurisdiction&quot;, &quot;between the defendant 
  and the forum province&quot;, &quot;with the transaction or the parties&quot; 
  and &quot;with the action&quot;. In my view the right to resist jurisdiction 
  in the absence of a &quot;real and substantial connection&quot; is the equivalent 
  of the assertion of a substantive defence to the action. From this, it follows, 
  therefore, that an order dismissing such a challenge is final in nature for 
  the purposes of appeal. </p>
<p>
  [11] Accordingly, I would dismiss the motion to quash this appeal. The appellants 
  may make brief written submissions as to costs within ten days of the release 
  of these reasons. Responding submissions, if any, to be made within ten days 
  thereafter. </p>
