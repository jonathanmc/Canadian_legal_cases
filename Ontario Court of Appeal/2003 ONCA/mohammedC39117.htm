<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Thomas M. Wood of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated March 22, 2001.</p>    <P>
  BY THE COURT:</p>    <P>
  [1] The appellant, Jameel Mohammed, commenced two actions against the respondent, 
  the Municipality of Dysart.</p>    <P>
  [2] The first action, commenced in Newmarket, claimed $5,000,000 in damages 
  for the removal of objects Mr. Mohammed placed on his mother's grave. He also 
  sought a declaration that Orison stones, which have a significance in his religion, 
  be left in place.</p>    <P>
  [3] In the second action, commenced in Peterborough, Mr. Mohammed sought $10,000,000 
  in damages in respect of the municipality's administrative process and decision 
  concerning his request to erect a monument at his mother's burial site.</p>    <P>
  [4] The municipality brought motions for summary judgment in both of these actions. 
  Justice Thomas M. Wood granted most, but not all, of the relief sought by the 
  municipality.</p>    <P>
  [5] Mr. Mohammed appeals several components of the motion judge's orders. The 
  municipality cross appeals in relation to three aspects of the same orders.</p>    <P>
  A. Mr. Mohammed's Appeal</p>    <P>
  [6] The essential thrust of Mr. Mohammed's appeal is that the motion judge erred 
  by striking out all of the Peterborough action and subparagraph 1(a) of the 
  Newmarket action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. The foundation 
  for this holding by the motion judge was a previous decision of the Divisional 
  Court dismissing an application brought by Mr. Mohammed in which he sought various 
  forms of relief against the municipality in relation to the same burial site.</p>    <P>
  [7] We do not accept Mr. Mohammed's submissions on this issue. In our view, 
  the motion judge's statement of the relevant legal principles, in particular 
  res judicata, was sound and his application of the principles to all of the 
  components of the two actions was correct (with one exception, to be dealt with 
  on the cross appeal). The Newmarket and Peterborough actions overlapped in many 
  respects with each other and, more importantly, covered virtually all of the 
  same ground as the matters which had been dealt with by the Divisional Court 
  in earlier litigation.</p>    <P>
  [8] For completeness, we would indicate that we see no error in the motion judge's 
  exercise of discretion in setting aside the noting in default of the municipality 
  in the Newmarket action.</p>    <P>
  B. The municipality's cross appeal</p>    <P>
  [9] The municipality contends that the motion judge erred in not striking out 
  subparagraph 1(k) of the Statement of Claim in the Newmarket action. We agree. 
  This subparagraph, like subparagraph 1(a) which the motion judge struck out, 
  covers the same ground as subparagraph 1(a) of the Statement of Claim in the 
  Peterborough action and the decision of the Divisional Court. The logic of the 
  motion judge's reasons should have led to subparagraph 1(k) being struck out, 
  either as an abuse of process (improper duplication) or on the basis of res 
  judicata.</p>    <P>
  [10] In its motion for summary judgment in the Newmarket action, the municipality 
  sought an order striking out the jury notice on the basis that a jury trial 
  is unavailable in an action where declaratory relief or relief against a municipality 
  is sought. The motion judge, in otherwise comprehensive reasons, did not consider 
  this issue. In our view, it is clear that the municipality was entitled to this 
  order: see s. 108(2) 10 and 12 of the Courts of Justice Act.</p>    <P>
  [11] The municipality contends that the motion judge erred by not ordering that 
  Mr. Mohammed provide security for costs in the Newmarket action. The motion 
  judge did not consider this issue. Based on our review of the record, and bearing 
  in mind that an order of security for costs is a discretionary order, we are 
  not inclined to hold that the motion judge erred by failing to make such an 
  order.</p>    <P>
  Disposition</p>    <P>
  [12] Mr. Mohammed's appeal is dismissed.</p>    <P>
  [13] The municipality's appeal with respect to striking out subparagraph 1(k) 
  of the Statement of Claim and the striking of the jury notice in the Newmarket 
  action is allowed. The municipality's appeal relating to security for costs 
  in the Newmarket action is dismissed.</p>    <P>
  [14] The municipality has been substantially successful on the appeal and the 
  cross appeal and is entitled to its costs on a partial indemnity scale, which 
  we would fix at $8000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>    <P>
