<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The submissions at bottom challenge the findings of fact made by the trial 
  judge in the course of her ruling that the statement was voluntary. Those findings 
  are supported by the evidence, demonstrate an appreciation of the relevant legal 
  principles and reveal no misapprehension of the evidence.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] Even if we were to agree with the appellant's contention that the police 
  conduct reflects a flagrant indifference to the appellant's status as a confidential 
  informant, that conduct post-dated the taking of the statement by months and 
  is unconnected to either the fairness of police conduct when the statement was 
  made or the fairness of the appellant's trial. <br>
</p>
<P>[3] The abuse of process argument was not made at trial and, in our view, adds 
  nothing to the arguments made against the admissibility of the statement.<br>
</p>
<P>[4] The appeal is dismissed.<br>
</p>
<P>[5] We will not make the non-publication order sought by Mr. Harris. The appellant's 
  status and his involvement with the police have been a matter of public record 
  for many years.</p>
