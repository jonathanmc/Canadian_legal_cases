<p>On appeal from the decision of Justice James M. Farley of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated January 15, 2003.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] The only issue that needs to be addressed in this appeal is whether the 
  motion judge, Farley J., erred in holding that the Molson bottle claim did not 
  qualify as a &quot;CCAA claim&quot;, as that term was defined in his Order of 
  April 3, 2002. The relevant portion of the definition of a &quot;CCAA claim&quot; 
  reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  any right or claim of any person against CPI that CPI is obligated to pay pursuant 
  to paragraph 15 &#133; of the Initial Order. </p>
<p>
  [2] Paragraph 15 of the Initial Order, which was made on May 23, 2001 by the 
  motion judge, reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  THIS COURT ORDERS that during the Stay Period, Persons having written or oral 
  agreements with the Applicants or statutory or regulatory mandates for the supply 
  of goods and/or services or insurance, including without limitation, all computer 
  software, communication and other data services, centralized and other banking 
  services, accounts and facilities, payroll servicing, insurance including directors' 
  and officers' insurance, natural gas, sand, soda ash, limestone, crushed recycled 
  glass, packaging materials, pallets, electricity, supply contracts, service 
  contracts, transportation contracts, transportation services, utility or other 
  required services by or to the Applicants or any of the Property are hereby 
  restrained until further order of this Court from discontinuing, dishonouring, 
  failing to renew on reasonable terms, altering, interfering with, suspending, 
  delaying, cancelling, interrupting, or terminating the supply of such goods, 
  services or facilities so long as the normal prices or charges for such goods, 
  services and facilities received after the date of this Order are paid in accordance 
  with present payment practices or as may be hereafter agreed to by the Applicants 
  from time to time and that the existing directors' and officers' insurance, 
  provided the Applicants pay the premiums at the current rates required under 
  such policies of insurance, shall hereby be deemed to be extended by a period 
  of time equal to the duration of the stay of proceedings effected by this Order 
  and any further order of this Court unless the applicable insurer for such directors' 
  and officers' insurance, on 7 days notice to the Monitor and the Applicants, 
  obtains leave of this Court not to renew such director's and officer's insurance.</p>
<p>
  [3] The dispute over what qualifies as a &quot;CCAA claim&quot; arises because 
  literally read, paragraph 15 of the Initial Order did not create any obligations 
  on CPI to pay amounts to third parties. </p>
<p>
  [4] The Initial Order, which was made under the Companies Creditors Arrangement 
  Act (&quot;CCAA&quot;) stayed legal proceedings against CPI for a specified 
  period of time (&quot;the stay period&quot;). Paragraph 15 directed that during 
  the stay period, persons with certain specified types of agreements with CPI 
  would be restrained from discontinuing, delaying, interrupting or terminating 
  the supply of goods, services and facilities so long as normal prices were paid 
  in accordance with existing payment practices.</p>
<p>
  [5] In setting out the types of agreements to which the restraining order applied, 
  paragraph 15 referred to agreements for the supply of goods and/or services, 
  including supply contracts by or to CPI. </p>
<p>
  [6] After the Initial Order, CPI continued to supply Molson with bottles pursuant 
  to a pre-existing agreement, and Molson paid CPI in full for the bottles supplied. 
  Molson's bottle claim is based on an allegation that CPI breached the agreement 
  with Molson by designing defective bottles during the stay period. As a result, 
  Molson alleges that CPI is liable for approximately $4 million in unliquidated 
  damages in relation to bottles that were produced and sold by O-I Canada Corp., 
  which purchased CPI's glass producing assets. </p>
<p>
  [7] Pursuant to the Order of April 3, 2002, CPI made an assignment in bankruptcy. 
  At the same time, the motion judge ordered, that there be established an Administration 
  Fund of $5 million to satisfy &quot;CCAA claims&quot; as defined in the Order. 
  </p>
<p>
  [8] Molson asserted that its bottle claim qualified as a &quot;CCAA claim&quot; 
  arguing that pursuant to paragraph 15 of the Initial Order, it was restrained 
  from withdrawing from its contract with CPI, and that pursuant to that contract, 
  CPI is obliged to pay Molson the damages incurred as a result of the design 
  of the defective bottles. </p>
<p>
  [9] The motion judge did not accept this argument. In his reasons, the motion 
  judge properly recognized that the intention of the monitor who sought the Order 
  of April 3, 2002, was not relevant to the interpretation of what constitutes 
  a &quot;CCAA claim&quot; pursuant to that Order. However, the motion judge implicitly 
  considered his own intent when he made the Order of April 3, 2002.</p>
<p>
  [10] The motion judge held that &quot;CCAA claims&quot; were limited to claims 
  of suppliers who continued to supply CPI during the stay period, who extended 
  credit and who had unpaid accounts at the time of the assignment into bankruptcy. 
  Accordingly, the Molson bottle claim, a claim for unliquidated damages, did 
  not qualify. </p>
<p>
  [11] In his reasons, the motion judge stated the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This Administration Fund was to provide protection - on a fairness basis - as 
  to any supplier who would have supplied on credit and a bankruptcy having occurred 
  (as it did) before the credit had been fully discharged by payment. This Administration 
  Fund was in essence a gratuitous arrangement designed to provide fairness.</p>
<p>
  [12] We see no basis on which to interfere with the motion judge's denial of 
  the Molson's bottle claim. Although the language used to define a &quot;CCAA 
  claim&quot;, particularly the reference to paragraph 15 of the Initial Order 
  is not as clear as it might be, the motion judge's interpretation is nonetheless 
  reasonable. </p>
<p>
  [13] Even if one accepts that paragraph 15 of the Initial Order restrained Molson 
  from withdrawing from its agreement with CPI because paragraph 15 referred to 
  supply contracts both by or to CPI (CPI was supplying to Molson), it is reasonable 
  to interpret paragraph 15 as specifically restraining parties to agreements 
  from terminating or otherwise interfering with the supply of goods, services 
  or facilities to CPI. Accordingly, in interpreting what was meant by the reference 
  to paragraph 15 in the April 3, 2002 Order, it was open for the motion judge 
  to conclude that the reference was only to monies owing as a result of the supply 
  of goods, services or facilities to CPI and nothing else.</p>
<p>
  [14] In addition, it should be kept in mind that the creation of the Administration 
  Fund was voluntary. The Fund was created after the obligations it was designed 
  to satisfy had been incurred. The creation of the Fund had the effect of conferring 
  a preference on those claims that qualified by elevating them to a preferred 
  status in the CPI bankruptcy. The intent was that CCAA claims would be paid 
  in full in priority to unsecured claims. From a practical and commercial standpoint, 
  it seems unlikely that the intent in creating the Fund would have been to establish 
  a preference for what could be unknown, potentially large, unliquidated claims. 
  </p>
<p>
  [15] Finally, it is important to recognize that the issue on this appeal is 
  the motion judge's interpretation of his own Order. His interpretation deserves 
  deference from this court. The motion judge, who is experienced in insolvency 
  matters, had been involved throughout the CCAA proceeding. He was in an ideal 
  position to assess what would be fair in the context of the CPI insolvency and 
  to interpret what constitutes a &quot;CCAA claim&quot; as defined in his Order 
  of April 3, 2002.</p>
<p>
  [16] We see no reason to interfere with the decision of the motion judge. </p>
<p>
  [17] Molson brought this matter before this court by way of a notice of appeal 
  or, if necessary, by way of a motion for leave to appeal. The parties made submissions 
  about whether, given the procedural background of the Molson bottle claim, leave 
  to appeal was required. It is not necessary for us to address that issue. Even 
  if leave is required and were to be granted, we would dismiss the appeal. Accordingly, 
  we will treat this as an appeal and order that the appeal be dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [18] The appellant shall pay the respondents' costs of this appeal, fixed in 
  the amount of $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
