<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The respondent did not appear although properly served with the notice 
  of appeal, the materials relied upon by the Crown in support of the appeal and 
  the notice of hearing for today's date. The court waited until 11:50 a.m. before 
  proceeding.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The Crown appeals an eleven month conditional sentence and one year probation 
  order imposed upon the respondent following his pleas of guilty to charges of 
  robbery and break and enter committed in relation to a home invasion. In addition, 
  the respondent plead guilty to uttering a death threat and theft under with 
  respect to two other separate incidents.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] In our view, the sentence is demonstrably unfit. Given the seriousness 
  of the offences, the extent of the respondent's criminal record and the fact 
  that the home invasion occurred while the respondent was on two release orders 
  and subject to two probation orders we consider that a medium to long reformatory 
  term is warranted. Taking into account the pre-trial custody and the five months 
  served under the conditional sentence, we are of the view that a further period 
  of imprisonment of 8 months is appropriate.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the sentence is varied in accordance 
  with these reasons. The period of probation is maintained.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Warrants for the arrest and committal of the respondent will issue.</p>
