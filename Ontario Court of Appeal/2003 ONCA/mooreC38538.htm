<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Douglas Rutherford of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 10, 2002.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] Richard Moore left the job of President of the Thomas Fuller Construction 
  Co. (1958) Limited effective July 31, 1999. He successfully sued for his pro 
  rata share of his 1999 entitlement under the company's profit-sharing plan, 
  namely 7/12 of 10 percent of its 1999 net profits.</p>
<p>[2] His employer appeals, arguing that where the profit-sharing bonus is not 
  calculated until year end, there can be no implied provision that an employee 
  who resigns mid-year gets a pro rata share. </p>
<p>[3] In our view, the disposition of this appeal turns on the determination 
  of the precise terms of Mr. Moore's employment contract. </p>
<p>[4] The trial judge found that the essential terms of this contract were not 
  reduced to writing. </p>
<p>[5] He also found one of those essential terms to be that the profit-sharing 
  plan was an integral part of Mr. Moore's compensation package. That plan was 
  completely non-discretionary. It provided each employee with a fixed percentage 
  of the company's net profits for the year regardless of the employee's performance 
  or contribution to those profits. Mr. Moore's share was 10 percent annually.</p>
<p>[6] Finally, the trial judge found that the company did not tell Mr. Moore 
  that he would get no bonus if he left mid-year and that there was no practice 
  to that effect sufficient to make that consequence clear to Mr. Moore.</p>
<p>[7] The appellant challenges only the last finding of fact, arguing that the 
  practice was clear and Mr. Moore should have understood from it that if he left 
  in July he would get no bonus for that year.</p>
<p>[8] In our view, the trial judge was amply justified in making the finding 
  he did. There was evidence that previous cases were equivocal and that in any 
  event Mr. Moore was unaware of some of them. This finding cannot be said to 
  reflect the palpable and overriding error necessary for us to intervene.</p>
<p>[9] The trial judge correctly found that Mr. Moore's contract of employment 
  provided that his compensation for the year included as an integral component 
  a guarantee of 10 percent of the company's net profits for that year. In construing 
  the contract to give Mr. Moore 7/12 of that for working the first seven months, 
  the trial judge was simply giving business efficacy to the compensation provision. 
  Mr. Moore was as entitled to this part of his compensation package as he was 
  to 7/12 of his annual salary for working those seven months. The company could 
  have negotiated a different contract with Mr. Moore that, for example, made 
  the payment of a bonus discretionary, or conditioned the bonus on service for 
  a full year. As the company did not do so, we are of the view that the trial 
  judge reached the correct result in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p>[10] We would dismiss the appeal with costs fixed on a partial indemnity basis 
  at $7,500 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
