<p>On appeal from the conviction after trial before Justice Arthur Gans, sitting 
  with a jury, dated January 20, 2000 and if leave be granted, appeal against 
  the sentence imposed on March 3, 2000.</p>
<p>ARMSTRONG J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] After trial before Gans J. and a jury, Michael Morey, the appellant, was 
  convicted of two counts of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine, one count of trafficking 
  in cocaine, one count of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, 
  one count of production of marijuana, two counts of possession of marijuana 
  for the purpose of trafficking and one count of possession of cannabis resin 
  for the purpose of trafficking. He was sentenced to a cumulative sentence of 
  seven years imprisonment. The court also ordered the forfeiture of $45,400 in 
  cash.</p>
<p>
  [2] Mr. Morey appeals his convictions and seeks leave to appeal the sentence 
  of seven years. </p>
<p>
  [3] Much of the evidence led by the Crown was derived from telephone wiretaps 
  pursuant to an authorization issued by Justice John Hamilton of the Superior 
  Court of Justice on May 9, 1997. The appellant sought to exclude the evidence 
  and brought a Garofoli application before the trial judge in which he alleged 
  a breach of his right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure pursuant 
  to s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. See R. v. Garofoli (1990), 
  60 C.C.C. (3d) 161 (S.C.C.). After a voir dire, the trial judge denied the application 
  and admitted the impugned evidence. The ruling of the trial judge, admitting 
  the wiretap evidence, is the focus of the conviction appeal.</p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [4] In May and June 1997, intercepted communications indicated that Mr. Morey 
  was directing a drug distribution network with the assistance of Mark Oleksiuk. 
  Police surveillance observed the appellant at pay telephones and in meetings 
  with Oleksiuk.</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant was also involved with Oleksiuk in managing a hydroponic marijuana 
  production operation located in an apartment in Scarborough. A search warrant, 
  executed at the apartment on 2 occasions, revealed 13 mature (4 to 5 feet high) 
  marijuana plants, 22 small plants and various pieces of cultivation equipment. 
  Also found during one of the searches of the apartment were a quarter kilogram 
  of cocaine, 9.5 grams of cocaine, a jar of dextrose, an electronic scale, plastic 
  baggies, a metal press and other drug paraphernalia. </p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant apparently expected the likelihood of wiretaps and used what 
  is described in his counsel's factum as &quot;guarded, cryptic language&#133;and 
  a system of pagers, cellular telephone and pay telephones in an effort to avoid 
  police detection.&quot; The appellant was heard during the wiretapped conversations 
  to admonish others for using incriminating language.</p>
<p>
  [7] Oleksiuk was arrested in the stairwell of the apartment building in late 
  June 1997. In a subsequent telephone call with Oleksiuk's girlfriend, which 
  was intercepted, the appellant was heard to discuss Oleksiuk's arrest and his 
  stupidity in leaving &quot;the other thing&quot; (cocaine) in the apartment. 
  In the same conversation, the appellant referred to Oleksiuk as &quot;working 
  for me&quot;. Also in the same conversation, the appellant remarked that what 
  Oleksiuk had to worry about was &quot;the people that I know&#133;if they find 
  out that&#133;he's even in there (jail), it's not going to be happy&#133;it's 
  not going to be a nice scene at all, believe me.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [8] With Oleksiuk in jail, the appellant started using another distributor, 
  Matthew Elliott, as his lieutenant. Intercepted telephone calls between the 
  appellant and Elliott and others provided additional evidence of the appellant's 
  involvement in drug trafficking, as did police surveillance of his activities. 
  The appellant was arrested on July 3, 1997. </p>
<p>
  The Wiretap Authorization and the Garofoli Application</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant first came to the attention of the RCMP in 1995 during a drug 
  investigation initiated in Newfoundland. That investigation revealed that the 
  appellant, who resided in the Toronto area, was involved in the illicit drug 
  trade with one of the targets of the Newfoundland investigation.</p>
<p>
  [10] The RCMP did not pursue a full-scale investigation of the appellant until 
  1997 due to lack of resources. Early in that year, they began to focus their 
  attention on the appellant. They conducted a number of background checks involving 
  information provided by an informant, which included addresses, telephone numbers, 
  vehicle registrations and places of employment. They also conducted surveillance 
  of the appellant's activities on 19 occasions.</p>
<p>
  [11] The application for the wiretap authorization was supported by an affidavit 
  of Constable Cecil Young of the RCMP, a member of the force's Newmarket Drug 
  Section. Young had been a drug investigator since 1994. His affidavit indicated 
  that he had received information regarding the appellant from an informant who 
  had purchased narcotics in the past from the appellant, whom the informant had 
  known for several years. </p>
<p>
  [12] Constable Young deposed in his affidavit that from January 1996 to March 
  1997, he had received information from the informant &quot;indicating that Morey 
  is a drug trafficker and involved with receiving cocaine and cannabis resin 
  (hashish) from Quebec for distribution in Ontario, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland 
  and Labrador&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [13] Constable Young's affidavit detailed a number of activities of the appellant 
  concerning his involvement in the drug trade. The affidavit referred to persons 
  with whom the appellant engaged in drug activities based upon information obtained 
  from the informant. The informant also provided information concerning the appellant's 
  modus operandi including his use of a pager, cell phones and pay phones.</p>
<p>
  [14] During cross-examination on the voir dire to determine the admissibility 
  of the wiretap evidence, Constable Young revealed that the informant had not 
  had any contact with the appellant for approximately 11 months prior to Constable 
  Young swearing his affidavit. Appellant's counsel noted that Constable Young 
  consistently employed the present tense in his affidavit and had left the impression 
  that the information was current when, in fact, it was at least 11 months old.</p>
<p>
  [15] During cross-examination Constable Young also admitted that he did not 
  ask his informant when in the past he had purchased narcotics from the appellant. 
  He agreed in hind-sight that he should have made such an inquiry but had overlooked 
  it.</p>
<p>
  [16] Appellant's counsel was also able to demonstrate that Constable Young had 
  failed in many instances to obtain from his informant particulars of the specific 
  drug dealings with other persons referred to in his affidavit.</p>
<p>
  [17] On the voir dire, the appellant advanced several arguments. The following 
  were the principal submissions considered by the trial judge:</p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The affidavit of Constable Young was purposely mis-leading 
  in that he used the present tense thereby creating the impression that the information 
  was current when he knew that the informant had not spoken to the appellant 
  in approximately 11 months. The appellant buttressed this branch of the argument 
  by submitting that the informant was not reliable because he had not been tested 
  in previous cases. </p>
<p class="indent">2. Since the information was stale dated, it could not support 
  a reasonable belief that the wiretap would afford evidence that a crime had 
  been or was being committed. </p>
<p class="indent">3. The police failed to establish that there was investigative 
  necessity for the authorization. </p>
<p>
  [18] On the issue of whether Constable Young had purposely misled the authorizing 
  judge, the trial judge concluded that he had benefited from observing the officer 
  on the witness stand. He stated:</p>
<p class="indent"> While, from time to time, I was frustrated by the manner in 
  which he testified, I do not doubt that his demeanour was coloured by his desire 
  to shelter the identity of the informer. I have concluded, after watching him 
  for more than two days, that his testimony before me and the turn of phrase 
  used in the affidavit were devoid of guile. Such were actuated, in my opinion, 
  by, perhaps, inexperience or a genuine belief that what was being done was not 
  meant to deceive. He was truly of the belief that the information he was receiving 
  from the informer was the &quot;straight goods&quot;, to use the vernacular. 
  He had no reason to believe otherwise. I would observe, parenthetically, that 
  even though the affidavit was reviewed by Constable Young's immediate superior, 
  and a Department of Justice lawyer, it did appear at times somewhat &quot;inelegant&quot; 
  and often confused. </p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> I therefore hold, from a review of the affidavit writ large 
  and the limited use to which I make of the amplified record that there is nothing, 
  over-all, which would mislead Hamilton J. In any event, if the tense employed 
  to describe the informer's evidence was confusing, which at times it was, such 
  was not, as I have found, done purposefully.</p>
<p>
  [19] The trial judge also concluded that the evidence was sufficient to establish 
  reasonable and probable grounds that the appellant was, at the date when the 
  affidavit was sworn, engaged in the commission of a crime. The trial judge reached 
  his conclusion &quot;from a review of the altered or expurgated version of the 
  affidavit&quot;. He reviewed &quot;those items 'remaining', regardless of the 
  timing of their occurrence&#133;which&#133;provide[d] reasonable and probable 
  grounds&#133;&quot; that the appellant was involved in illicit drug trafficking.</p>
<p>
  [20] The trial judge made specific reference to the 1995 wiretap in the Newfoundland 
  investigation. He also took into account the information related to the appellant's 
  associations and connections in the illicit drug trade except for his brother 
  and his nephew.</p>
<p>
  [21] He accepted that the background checks done by the police and the surveillance 
  carried out on the appellant confirmed the reliability of the informant's information. 
  </p>
<p>
  [22] Finally, the trial judge concluded that the applicant for the wiretap authorization 
  had discharged the obligation of establishing investigative necessity. </p>
<p>
  The Appellant's Position in this Court</p>
<p>
  [23] In his factum and in his oral argument, the appellant made several submissions, 
  some of which were overlapping. His submissions can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) he reasserted his argument that the affidavit of Constable 
  Young was purposely misleading;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the trial judge erred in failing to excise the misleading 
  evidence from his review of the wiretap authorization;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the trial judge applied the wrong test as a basis for 
  considering the amplified record; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) there was insufficient evidence to support the wiretap 
  authorization on any basis - with or without the amplified record and whether 
  or not the alleged misleading evidence was excised.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [24] I start with the applicable standard of review which a trial judge must 
  apply when considering an authorizing judge's order. As stated by Sopinka J. 
  in R. v. Garofoli, supra, at page 188:</p>
<p class="indent"> The reviewing judge does not substitute his or her view for 
  that of the authorizing judge. If based on the record which was before the authorizing 
  judge as amplified on review, the reviewing judge concludes that the authorizing 
  judge could have granted the authorization, then he or she should not interfere. 
  In this process, the existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence 
  and new evidence are all relevant, but, rather than being a prerequisite to 
  review, their sole impact is to determine whether there continues to be any 
  basis for the decision of the authorizing judge.</p>
<p>
  It is clear that the trial judge was alive to the direction of Sopinka J. He 
  expressly repeated the admonition that a trial judge is not entitled to substitute 
  his or her view for that of the authorizing judge.</p>
<p>
  [25] It is also important to be mindful of the standard which this court must 
  apply to its review of a trial judge's decision on a Garofoli application. The 
  standard is succinctly described by Charron J.A. in R. v. Grant (1998), 132 
  C.C.C. (3d) 531 at 540 (Ont. C.A.):</p>
<p class="indent"> This court is also a reviewing court and the test in Garofoli 
  is applicable on this appeal. In addition, the usual deference is owed to the 
  findings of the trial judge in her assessment of the record &quot;as amplified 
  on the review&quot; and her disposition of the s. 8 application. In the absence 
  of an error of law, a misapprehension of the evidence or a failure to consider 
  relevant evidence, this court should not interfere with the trial judge's conclusions. 
  [Emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [26] I turn now to consider the specific submissions of the appellant. </p>
<p>
  (i) The affidavit of Constable Young was purposely misleading.</p>
<p>
  [27] The trial judge was aware of the deficiencies in Constable Young's affidavit 
  and made particular reference to Young's inadvisable use of the present tense 
  in regard to events that were at least 11 months old. The trial judge concluded 
  that the deficiencies in Young's affidavit were not intended to mislead but 
  were the product of inexperience or a genuine belief that the information that 
  he was receiving from the informant was the &quot;straight goods&quot;. I do 
  not think it can be said that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence. He 
  was clearly entitled and required to assess Constable Young's credibility. He 
  did so, and I defer to his assessment. I therefore would not interfere with 
  the trial judge's conclusion that the affidavit of Constable Young was not purposely 
  misleading.</p>
<p>
  (ii) The trial judge's failure to excise misleading evidence from his review. 
  </p>
<p>
  [28] It was the appellant's submission that those paragraphs from Constable 
  Young's affidavit which relate to the information obtained from the informant 
  should have been excised from the trial judge's review. According to the appellant, 
  if he had done so, the record would have been bereft of sufficient evidence 
  to support the wiretap authorization.</p>
<p>
  [29] As already indicated, the trial judge did consider the affidavit of Constable 
  Young on an &quot;expurgated&quot; basis and concluded that there was sufficient 
  evidence to support the authorization. As I comprehend the appellant's submission, 
  the trial judge either did not &quot;expurgate&quot; sufficient evidence or 
  he simply misapprehended the evidence after the expurgation exercise. </p>
<p>
  [30] In my review of the trial judge's reasons, I am unable to ascertain what 
  he meant when he referred to the &quot;altered or expurgated version of the 
  affidavit&quot;. No where did he set out precisely what it is that he has excised 
  or expurgated from the affidavit of Constable Young. I have tried to determine 
  what has been expurgated by reviewing what he expressly accepted as sufficient 
  evidence for the authorization on the assumption that he excluded everything 
  else. However, such an exercise produces no more than conjecture on my part.</p>
<p>
  [31] If it is not possible to ascertain what is the altered or expurgated version 
  of the affidavit, it is not possible to determine, as submitted by the appellant, 
  whether or not the trial judge erred in failing to excise the alleged misleading 
  evidence from his review of the wiretap authorization </p>
<p>
  (iii) The trial judge applied the wrong test in admitting the amplified record.</p>
<p>
  [32] The appellant argued that the Crown could not rely on the amplified record 
  which emerged from the cross-examination of Constable Young because, in his 
  submission, Constable Young and the police, in their investigation and the preparation 
  of the Young affidavit, failed to act in good faith. R. v. Aroujo (2000), 149 
  C.C.C. (3d) 449 at paras. 57 and 59 (S.C.C.) is cited as authority for this 
  proposition. The appellant argued that the trial judge applied an incorrect 
  test of deliberate falsehood to the conduct of the police. As a result, he was 
  disentitled to consider the amplified record.</p>
<p>
  [33] Although the trial judge did not use the words &quot;good faith&quot; in 
  considering the conduct of Constable Young and the police, there can be no doubt 
  that his finding of credibility in regard to Constable Young is tantamount to 
  a finding of good faith. The trial judge's reference to the Young affidavit 
  as devoid of guile and lacking the intention to deceive confirms the judge's 
  view that there was no failure of good faith on the part of Constable Young 
  and his associates. </p>
<p>
  [34] However, the fact that the trial judge employed the correct test is not 
  the end of the matter. I have a concern as to precisely what the trial judge 
  meant when he said he made limited use of the amplified record. He does not 
  define the limited use nor what he included in the record as a result of the 
  amplification. I am prepared to say that the limited use of the amplified record 
  likely refers to the viva voce evidence of Constable Young which he used for 
  the purpose of assessing his credibility. However, I cannot be sure that the 
  trial judge may not be referring to something more.</p>
<p>
  (iv) There was insufficient evidence to support the wiretap authorization on 
  any basis.</p>
<p>
  [35] In the view I take of the trial judge's failure to define what he meant 
  by the altered or expurgated version of the affidavit of Constable Young and 
  the limited use of the amplified record, I am not able to conclude whether he 
  was correct in his conclusion that the authorizing judge could have granted 
  the wiretap order. Put another way, I cannot be persuaded whether there was 
  or was not a breach of s. 8 of the Charter. However, on the assumption that 
  there was a s. 8 Charter breach, I move to a s. 24(2) analysis. </p>
<p>
  Section 24(2) of the Charter</p>
<p>
  [36] The trial judge held that he would not have excluded the wiretap evidence 
  under s. 24(2) of the Charter even if he had found a violation of s. 8. I agree 
  with him. He found that Constable Young had acted in good faith in that his 
  supporting affidavit was &quot;devoid of guile&quot;. The admission of the evidence 
  did not, in my view, affect the fairness of the trial. The admission of the 
  wiretap evidence would not have brought the administration of justice into disrepute. 
  See R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265. Indeed as Doherty J.A. said in R. v. 
  Lewis (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 540 at 554 when discussing the exclusion of cocaine 
  obtained in an unlawful search:</p>
<p class="indent"> There can be no doubt that the exclusion of this kind of evidence 
  exacts a heavy toll on the repute of the administration of justice.</p>
<p>
  Sentence Appeal</p>
<p>
  [37] At trial, counsel for the appellant submitted that the appropriate sentence 
  was &quot;marginally below five years&quot;. The Crown asked for a sentence 
  of 10 to 12 years. The trial judge imposed a cumulative sentence of seven years 
  with a recommendation for early parole. </p>
<p>
  [38] The appellant submitted that the cumulative sentence of seven years is 
  harsh and excessive in all the circumstances, and that it lies beyond the range 
  of a sentence appropriate for the offences committed by the appellant. Counsel 
  made reference to the following factors considered by the trial judge:</p>
<p class="indent"> a. he had no relevant criminal record and should be treated 
  as a first offender;</p>
<p class="indent">b. although he ran an extensive drug operation, it was &quot;not 
  terribly profitable&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent">c. he grew marijuana and dealt in marijuana and hashish in the 
  &quot;multi-kilo&quot; level;</p>
<p class="indent">d. he was 37, in a common law relationship and was a doting 
  father to a child &quot;for whom he cares deeply&quot;;</p>
<p class="indent">e. he maintained his own construction business, had stayed out 
  of trouble since his arrest three years before and &quot;is clearly an individual 
  of more than modest ability and skills, and has demonstrated that he can be 
  a very useful member of society.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [39] Counsel for the Crown submitted that the appellant was the directing mind 
  and will of a significant, long-term trafficking organization. His sentence 
  ought to reflect that fact and the sentence imposed by the trial judge did so.</p>
<p>
  [40] In sentencing the appellant, the trial judge made the following comments:</p>
<p class="indent"> I do not intend to review the evidence adduced by the Crown 
  in its painstaking presentation which spanned some nearly six weeks of trial. 
  Suffice it to say that Mr. Morey was engaged in a reasonably high level and 
  sophisticated drug trafficking operation of which he was at the virtual apex. 
  He had, from time to time, different minions located on the front lines of trafficking 
  who naturally did his bidding, even though they were constantly at risk of detection. 
  He, on the other hand, was able to insulate himself from the vagaries associated 
  with direct involvement, until the wheels fell off the wagon in late June, 1997. 
  I assume that he purposefully set up his network in this fashion to avoid sullying 
  himself, while maintaining a partial aura of respectability as a contractor 
  and builder.</p>
<p class="indent">All that having been said, there is no doubt that the Morey 
  operation was extensive, dealt fairly large quantities of drugs, although from 
  some of the evidence, perhaps, not terribly profitably. It seems also that until 
  June 17, 1997 he was able to function without incident, as it were, but for 
  the usual problems associated with accounts receivable. The multi-kilos of hashish 
  and marijuana found at Deekshill, the crop in full bloom festooning the Eglinton 
  Avenue apartment, and the 15 or so ounces of cocaine and related paraphernalia 
  found on two occasions scattered throughout the apartment underscore the width 
  and breadth of operation.</p>
<p>
  [41] The trial judge also expressly considered the relevant principles of sentencing 
  and provided cogent reasons for his conclusion that seven years was the appropriate 
  sentence. I cannot discern that the trial judge committed any error in principle, 
  nor can I conclude that the sentence is manifestly unfit. In accordance with 
  the direction in R. v. Shropshire (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.), I must 
  defer to the trial judge's judgment on sentence. </p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [42] In the result, the appeal as to conviction is dismissed, the application 
  for leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal as to sentence is dismissed.</p>
