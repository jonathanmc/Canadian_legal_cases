<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] We can see no basis upon which we could interfere with the exercise of 
  discretion by the trial judge under s. 11(b). The conviction appeal is therefore 
  dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [2] We agree with the Crown that a conditional sentence was not appropriate 
  here. Having regard to the gravity and seriousness of the crimes and principles 
  of sentencing (esp. general and specific deterrence) he should have received 
  a custodial sentence of at least 2 years less a day. In our view a conditional 
  sentence did not adequately reflect these concerns. However, in light of the 
  fresh evidence indicating good conduct over the course of a year, that he has 
  taken treatment for impulse control and has supported his common law wife and 
  child, we do not feel that the interests of justice would be served by altering 
  the sentence at this time.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appeals are dismissed.</p>
