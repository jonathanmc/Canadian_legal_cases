<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Ruth E. Mesbur of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated September 26, 2002. </p>
<p>
  CRONK J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] We are concerned on this appeal with the civil liability in negligence for 
  damages of an unincorporated, voluntary association of Canadian securities dealers 
  and certain of its officers and employees in connection with economic losses 
  sustained by investors in their margin accounts with a member of the association. 
  The central issues are whether, in accordance with the test propounded in Anns 
  v. Merton London Borough Council, [1978] A.C. 728 (H.L.), the circumstances 
  of this case give rise to a relationship of proximity sufficient to ground a 
  duty of care owed by the association and its representatives to the appellants 
  and, if so, whether policy considerations negate such a duty of care.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellants opened margin accounts with Thomson Kernaghan &amp; Co. Limited 
  (&quot;TK Co.&quot;), a member of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada 
  (the &quot;IDA&quot;). After they suffered losses in their accounts, the appellants 
  sued TK Co. and Pat Teggart, a broker. Subsequently, after TK Co.'s membership 
  in the IDA was suspended and it was petitioned into bankruptcy, the appellants 
  sought to amend the statement of claim in their pending action to add the IDA 
  and certain of its representatives as defendants for the purpose of advancing 
  claims in negligence against them. By order dated September 26, 2002, Mesbur 
  J. of the Superior Court of Justice dismissed the motion on the basis that the 
  proposed claims disclosed no reasonable cause of action. For the reasons that 
  follow, I agree. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [3] TK Co. is a brokerage firm which, at the relevant times, carried on business 
  in Toronto. It was a member of the IDA and its activities were subject to the 
  Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5, as amended, (the &quot;Act&quot;) and the 
  rules of the Toronto Stock Exchange. In March 1999, the appellants opened two 
  margin accounts with TK Co. Mr. Morgis provided instructions to TK Co. concerning 
  the accounts and was authorized to make and approve trades in the accounts.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellants allege that TK Co. advocated an investment strategy that 
  emphasized securities in the high technology sector in the United States and 
  aggressive daily margin trades. They maintain that Mr. Morgis took various positions 
  of a speculative nature, investing in volatile securities through his trading 
  activity in the appellants' margin accounts in accordance with advice from TK 
  Co. and its represent-atives. They also allege, among other matters, that TK 
  Co. allowed trades to be made in contravention of TK Co.'s own margin requirements 
  and those of the industry, and that trades were made and money was withdrawn 
  without the appellants' authorization. Between March and April 2000 and thereafter, 
  the appellants sustained substantial losses in their accounts with TK Co.</p>
<p>
  [5] On January 8, 2001, the appellants commenced an action against TK Co. and 
  Pat Teggart claiming damages in the aggregate amount of $5.75 million for breach 
  of contract, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent misrepresentation 
  in connection with the operation of the appellants' margin accounts and the 
  losses they sustained.</p>
<p>
  [6] On July 11, 2002, the IDA suspended TK Co.'s membership in the IDA. On the 
  following day, TK Co. was petitioned into bankruptcy.</p>
<p>
  [7] On July 22, 2002, the appellants brought a motion under rules 26.01 and 
  26.02 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 seeking leave to 
  amend their statement of claim to add David Grand, F. G. Lee Simpson, Ronald 
  D. Kelterborn and Lance Longmore (collectively, the &quot;TK Co. parties&quot;) 
  as defendants.</p>
<p>
  [8] In the same motion, the appellants also sought to add the IDA, Terrance 
  K. Salman, G. F. Kym Anthony and Joseph J. Oliver (collectively, the &quot;IDA 
  parties&quot;) as defendants in their pending action. They claimed in their 
  proposed amended statement of claim that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [The IDA] is an unincorporated voluntary Association of Canadian Securities 
  Dealers governed by a constitution, by-laws and regulations which deal with 
  the conduct, management and control of the Association's affairs including the 
  conditions of membership, the rights and duties of and standards to be maintained 
  by members, the investigation of complaints against members and the imposition 
  of discipline for the misconduct of its members.</p>
<p>They further asserted that Terrance K. Salman is the Chair of the IDA, G. F. 
  Kym Anthony is its Vice-Chair, and Joseph J. Oliver is its President and Chief 
  Executive Officer.</p>
<p>
  [9] By order dated September 26, 2002, the motions judge granted the appellants' 
  motion concerning the TK Co. parties but dismissed their motion regarding the 
  IDA parties. In connection with the IDA parties, she held: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am therefore of the view that the proposed amendments to the claim in relation 
  to the proposed added IDA [parties] discloses no reasonable cause of action. 
  It is &quot;plain and obvious&quot; the action against them cannot succeed. 
  Accepting, as I must, all the facts pleaded as true, they are insufficient at 
  law to support a cause of action. Since that is the case, the relief sought 
  against the IDA [parties] is dismissed.</p>
<p>The appellants appeal the dismissal of their amendment motion concerning the 
  IDA parties.</p>
<p>
  II. INVESTMENT DEALERS ASSOCIATION OF CANADA</p>
<p>
  [10] Membership in the IDA is voluntary. It is based on the contractual commitment 
  of members to abide by the constitution, regulations, rules and by-laws of the 
  association. The IDA is not created by and does not derive its authority from 
  statute. Rather, it operates under the authority of its own constitution and 
  is recognized under some securities legislation. In Ontario, s. 21.1 of the 
  Act provides in part: </p>
<p class="indent">
  21.1 (1) The [Ontario Securities] Commission may, on the application of a self-regulatory 
  organization, recognize the self-regulatory organization if the Commission is 
  satisfied that to do so would be in the public interest.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> (3) A recognized self-regulatory organization shall regulate 
  the operations and the standards of practice and business conduct of its members 
  and their representatives in accordance with its by-laws, rules, regulations, 
  policies, procedures, interpretations and practices.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The Commission may, if it is satisfied that to do so would 
  be in the public interest, make any decision with respect to any by-law, rule, 
  regulation, policy, procedure, interpretation or practice of a recognized self-regulatory 
  organization.</p>
<p>
  [11] The IDA was recognized by the Ontario Securities Commission (the &quot;Commission&quot;) 
  as a self-regulatory organization under s. 21.1 of the Act on December 14, 1994: 
  In the Matter of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (1994), 17 O.S.C.B. 
  5961 (Ont. Sec. Comm.). The recitals to that recognition included the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  WHEREAS the IDA is an unincorporated association in which membership is voluntary. 
  It has approximately 111 investment dealers as members, all of whom, to the 
  extent they trade in securities or act as underwriters in Ontario, are registrants 
  under the Act and subject to regulatory oversight of the Commission. The IDA 
  represents its members and is organized for the purpose of regulating the operations 
  and the standards of practice and business conduct of its members and their 
  representatives with a view to promoting the protection of investors and the 
  public interest. The IDA regulates the conduct of its members and their trading 
  in securities through rules set forth in its by-laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent"> WHEREAS the Act and the Commodity Futures Act contemplate and 
  encourage self-regulation by registrants, but place the ultimate responsibility 
  for registrants' conduct with the Commission. &#133;</p>
<p  class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> WHEREAS each client of an IDA member is protected by [the Canadian 
  Investor Protection Fund] against losses resulting from dealer failure to a 
  maximum amount per client of $500,000 [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [12] The IDA's 1994 recognition by the Commission was subsequently renewed for 
  the period up to and after October 31, 1995, subject to terms and conditions 
  specified by the Commission. Those terms and conditions vest considerable supervisory 
  control of the IDA in the Commission. For example, they require the IDA to enforce 
  compliance by its members with the rules of the IDA, as a matter of contract 
  and without prejudice to any discipline by the Commission under Ontario securities 
  law. They also require the IDA, among other matters, to report misconduct or 
  apparent misconduct by IDA members to the Commission, to notify the Commission 
  on a monthly basis of investigations and reviews of IDA members and of all complaints 
  which lead to investigations being commenced by the IDA, and to refrain from 
  making fundamental changes to the organizational structure of the IDA which 
  would affect its self-regulatory functions without the prior approval of the 
  Commission: In the Matter of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (1995), 
  18 O.S.C.B. 5294 (Ont. Sec. Comm.).</p>
<p>
  III. THE PROPOSED CLAIMS AGAINST THE IDA PARTIES</p>
<p>
  [13] It is common ground that, for the purpose of the appellants' amendment 
  motion concerning the IDA parties, the motions judge was required to assume 
  that the facts alleged against the IDA parties in the appellants' proposed amended 
  statement of claim were true. In that pleading, the appellants allege that the 
  IDA is responsible for regulating investment dealers to protect the investing 
  public and that the IDA parties are responsible for overseeing professional 
  standards to ensure the competence of IDA members. They further assert that 
  Mr. Morgis complained to the IDA concerning T. K. Co. and one or more of its 
  representatives in about March 2001 and that, although Mr. Morgis followed up 
  with the IDA on several occasions concerning the status of the complaint, the 
  IDA failed to arrange to interview Mr. Morgis in connection with the complaint 
  until March 2002. </p>
<p>
  [14] Paragraphs 46 to 49 of the appellants' proposed amended statement of claim 
  read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 46. The IDA [parties] owed a duty of care to the [appellants], 
  as investors of [TK Co.] to ensure that the [TK Co. parties] complied with the 
  IDA's rules, regulations and by-laws.</p>
<p class="indent">47. The IDA [parties] were negligent and breached their duty 
  to the [appellants] in the following respects: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the IDA [parties] failed to ensure competence of the [TK 
  Co. parties]; </p>
<p class="indent">(b) the IDA [parties] failed to ensure that [TK Co.'s] employees, 
  particularly Mr. Teggart and Mr. Grand were of good character;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the IDA [parties] failed to ensure that [TK Co.] maintained 
  sufficient capital to protect the [appellants] in the circumstances;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the IDA [parties] failed to ensure that the [TK Co. parties] 
  conducted their business in accordance with the IDA's rules, regulations and 
  by-laws;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) the IDA [parties] failed to ensure that [TK Co.] had effective 
  procedures in place to supervise the handling of client accounts; and</p>
<p class="indent">(f) the IDA [parties] failed to investigate and discipline [TK 
  Co.], Mr. Teggart and Mr. Simpson in a timely or effective manner.</p>
<p class="indent">48. The IDA [parties] knew or ought to have known that these 
  failures would constitute a risk to [TK Co.] investors, and in particular, to 
  investors dealing with [the individual TK Co. parties].</p>
<p class="indent">49. The IDA [parties'] failures caused or contributed to the 
  [appellants'] losses.</p>
<p>IV. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [15] Although the appellants appeal on several grounds from the dismissal of 
  their amendment motion concerning the IDA parties, in my view all of the issues 
  raised are embodied in the core issue of whether the motions judge erred in 
  her application of the two part test established by Anns v. Merton London Borough 
  Council to the facts of this case. </p>
<p>
  V. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [16] The appellants' requested pleadings amendment to add the IDA parties as 
  defendants in this action is premised on the existence of a duty of care owed 
  by the IDA parties to the appellants, the breach of which gives rise to a cause 
  of action in negligence for damages. In this case, as characterized by the appellants 
  in their proposed amended statement of claim, the alleged duty of care is a 
  duty to the appellants in their capacity as investors of TK Co. &quot;to ensure 
  that [the TK Co. parties] complied with the IDA's rules, regulations and by-laws&quot;. 
  Without the existence of a duty of care, no cause of action in negligence exists 
  against the IDA parties.</p>
<p>
  (1) The Anns Test</p>
<p>
  [17] The motions judge correctly proceeded on the basis that &quot;the categories 
  of negligence are not closed&quot;: Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A. C. 562 
  (H.L.) and Cooper v. Hobart (2001), 206 D. L. R. (4th) 193 (S.C.C.). She also 
  recognized that where an alleged duty of care is as yet unrecognized under Canadian 
  law, the test set out in Anns v. Merton London Borough Council must be applied 
  to determine if the circumstances support the recognition of a duty of care. 
  </p>
<p>
  [18] The parties acknowledge that the recent decisions of the Supreme Court 
  of Canada in Cooper and in the companion case of Edwards v. Law Society of Upper 
  Canada (2001), 206 D.L.R. (4th) 211 are of particular relevance. In my view, 
  those cases and the related subsequent jurisprudence dictate the outcome of 
  this appeal. </p>
<p>
  [19] In Cooper, the court was concerned with the civil liability of a statutory 
  financial regulator. In considering that issue, the Supreme Court of Canada 
  reaffirmed and clarified the content and applicability of the Anns test in Canada. 
  Chief Justice McLachlin and Justice Major, writing for the court, said at pp. 
  201 and 203 of the Cooper decision: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In [Anns v. Merton London Borough Council] at pp. 751-52, the House of Lords, 
  per Lord Wilberforce, said that a duty of care required a finding of proximity 
  sufficient to create a prima facie duty of care, followed by consideration of 
  whether there were any factors negativing that duty of care. This Court has 
  repeatedly affirmed that approach as appropriate in the Canadian context.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent"> In brief compass, we suggest that at this stage in the evolution 
  of the law, both in Canada and abroad, the Anns analysis is best understood 
  as follows. At the first stage of the Anns test, two questions arise: (1) was 
  the harm that occurred the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's 
  act? and (2) are there reasons, notwithstanding the proximity between the parties 
  established in the first part of this test, that tort liability should not be 
  recognized here? The proximity analysis involved at the first stage of the Anns 
  test focuses on factors arising from the relationship between the plaintiff 
  and the defendant. These factors include questions of policy, in the broad sense 
  of that word. If foreseeability and proximity are established at the first stage, 
  a prima facie duty of care arises. At the second stage of the Anns test, the 
  question still remains whether there are residual policy considerations outside 
  the relationship of the parties that may negative the imposition of a duty of 
  care [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [20] The appellants in the Cooper case invested funds with a mortgage broker. 
  They alleged that the Registrar of Mortgage Brokers under the Mortgage Brokers 
  Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 313 was liable to them in negligence for failing to properly 
  oversee the conduct of the broker, which had been licensed by the Registrar. 
  The question before the court was whether the Registrar owed a private law duty 
  of care to investors resulting in tort liability for the economic losses sustained 
  by the investors. Chief Justice McLachlin and Justice Major commented at p. 
  204 concerning the proximity analysis required under the first branch of the 
  Anns test: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [I]t seems clear that the word &quot;proximity&quot; in connection with negligence 
  has from the outset and throughout its history been used to describe the type 
  of relationship in which a duty of care to guard against foreseeable negligence 
  may be imposed. &quot;Proximity&quot; is the term used to describe the &quot;close 
  and direct&quot; relationship that Lord Atkin described as necessary to grounding 
  a duty of care in Donoghue v. Stevenson &#133;</p>
<p  class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> As this Court stated in Hercules Managements Ltd. v. Ernst 
  &amp; Young,&#133;at para. 24, per La Forest J.: </p>
<p class="indent"> The label &quot;proximity&quot;, as it was used by Lord Wilberforce 
  in Anns, supra, was clearly intended to connote that the circumstances of the 
  relationship inhering between the plaintiff and the defendant are of such a 
  nature that the defendant may be said to be under an obligation to be mindful 
  of the plaintiff's legitimate interests in conducting his or her affairs. </p>
<p class="indent">Defining the relationship may involve looking at expectations, 
  representations, reliance, and the property or other interests involved. Essentially, 
  these are factors that allow us to evaluate the closeness of the relationship 
  between the plaintiff and the defendant and to determine whether it is just 
  and fair having regard to that relationship to impose a duty of care in law 
  upon the defendant [emphasis in original and citations omitted].</p>
<p>
  [21] The appellants argued in Cooper that the Registrar of Mortgage Brokers 
  should have acted earlier to suspend the broker in question, or to warn investors 
  of the broker's breaches of the statute's requirements. They claimed that their 
  economic losses were occasioned by the Registrar's failure to act more promptly. 
  The Supreme Court held that those allegations did not bring the case directly 
  or by analogy within a category of cases in which a duty of care had previously 
  been recognized. It also held that a new duty of care should not be recognized 
  because the Registrar's duty under the applicable statutory scheme was to the 
  public as a whole, rather than to individual investors. Consequently, there 
  was insufficient proximity between the Registrar and the investors to ground 
  a prima facie duty of care and the case did not meet the first branch of the 
  Anns test.</p>
<p>
  [22] The Supreme Court also concluded that the case failed to surmount the second 
  branch of the Anns test, that is, policy considerations existing outside the 
  relationship of the parties negated a prima facie duty of care by the Registrar, 
  even if one had been found to exist. As the reasoning of the Supreme Court in 
  support of that conclusion is of assistance here, it is useful to set it out 
  in full, as it appears at pp. 210-11 of the Cooper decision: </p>
<p class="indent"> The decision of whether to suspend a broker involves both policy 
  and quasi-judicial elements. The decision requires the Registrar to balance 
  the public and private interests. The Registrar is not simply carrying out a 
  predetermined government policy, but deciding, as an agent of the executive 
  branch of government, what that policy should be. Moreover, the decision is 
  quasi-judicial. The Registrar must act fairly or judicially in removing a broker's 
  licence. These requirements are inconsistent with a duty of care to investors. 
  Such a duty would undermine these obligations, imposed by the Legislature on 
  the Registrar. Thus even if a prima facie duty of care could be posited, it 
  would be negated by other overriding policy considerations. </p>
<p class="indent">The prima facie duty of care is also negated on the basis of 
  the distinction between government policy and the execution of policy. As stated, 
  the Registrar must make difficult discretionary decisions in the area of public 
  policy, decisions which command deference. As Huddart J.A. [of the British Columbia 
  Court of Appeal] (concurring in the result) found, the decisions made by the 
  Registrar were made within the limits of the powers conferred upon him in the 
  public interest.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, the spectre of indeterminate liability would loom large 
  if a duty of care was recognized as between the Registrar and investors in this 
  case. The Act itself imposes no limit and the Registrar has no means of controlling 
  the number of investors or the amount of money invested in the mortgage brokerage 
  system.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, we must consider the impact of a duty of care on the 
  taxpayers, who did not agree to assume the risk of private loss to persons in 
  the situation of the investors. To impose a duty of care in these circumstances 
  would be to effectively create an insurance scheme for investors at great cost 
  to the taxpaying public. There is no indication that the Legislature intended 
  that result.</p>
<p>
  [23] The Edwards case was released by the Supreme Court of Canada concurrently 
  with its decision in Cooper. While the latter case involved claims in negligence 
  against a regulator of mortgage brokers in British Columbia, Edwards concerned 
  claims in negligence against the Law Society of Upper Canada, the governing 
  body of the legal profession in Ontario. </p>
<p>
  [24] The appellants in Edwards deposited money into a solicitor's trust account, 
  which was used for the benefit of a securities company. After the money was 
  lost as a result of the fraudulent acts of the securities company, a complaint 
  was made to the Law Society which then commenced an investigation. The appellants 
  sued the solicitor but also sought to claim against the Law Society on the basis 
  that it allegedly failed to ensure that the solicitor was operating his trust 
  account according to the Law Society's rules, failed to conduct an adequate 
  investigation into the complaint, and failed to warn the appellants that their 
  interests were not protected. </p>
<p>
  [25] The Law Society Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.8, s. 9 contains an exemption from 
  suit clause, whereby no action for damages can be instituted against an official 
  of the Law Society for any act done in good faith in the performance of any 
  duty, or for any neglect or default in the performance or exercise in good faith 
  of any such duty or power. A similar statutory exemption from suit was available 
  to the regulator in Cooper under the legislation applicable in that case.</p>
<p>
  [26] For reasoning substantially similar to that set out in Cooper, the Supreme 
  Court concluded in Edwards that the appellants' proposed claims against the 
  Law Society failed on both branches of the Anns test: no prima facie duty of 
  care arose in the circumstances between the Law Society and the appellants and, 
  further, had such a duty of care been recognized, it would have been negated 
  by residual policy considerations existing outside the relationship of the parties. 
  Importantly, the Supreme Court held in Edwards that the obligations and duties 
  of the Law Society are owed to the public at large and not to individual members 
  of the public who complain regarding a professional governed by the Law Society. 
  This court subsequently applied that principle in Rogers v. Faught (2002), 212 
  D.L.R. (4th) 366 (Ont. C.A.) in relation to claims in a civil negligence action 
  against the governing bodies of the professions of dentistry and dental hygiene 
  in Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [27] The decisions in Cooper, Edwards and Rogers establish that statutory regulators 
  owe no private law duty of care to individual members of the public who deal 
  with the organizations or individuals whose conduct is overseen by the regulators. 
  Rather, where the governance mandate of such regulators is required to be discharged 
  in the public interest, the duties of the regulators are owed to the public 
  as a whole. Consequently, the question in this case is whether tort liability 
  may be imposed on a voluntary regulator of securities dealers at the instance 
  of members of the investing public who complain of the regulator's alleged failure 
  to ensure the competence and good character of a dealer's representatives and 
  to adequately supervise, monitor, investigate, and discipline the dealer.</p>
<p>
  (2) Application of the Anns Test</p>
<p>
  [28] The appellants advance two main arguments in support of their submission 
  that the motions judge erred in this case by dismissing their amendment motion 
  concerning the IDA parties. First, they assert that both branches of the Anns 
  test are satisfied here and that their claims against the IDA parties should 
  be permitted to proceed, at least beyond the pleadings stage of this action. 
  Second, they submit that, unlike the regulators in Cooper, Edwards and Rogers, 
  the IDA is not a statutory or quasi-statutory body and it does not enjoy the 
  benefit of a statutory exemption from suit. Accordingly, they argue that the 
  developed jurisprudence does not foreclose their claims against the IDA parties 
  at this stage of the action. Rather, those claims should be determined at trial 
  on a full evidentiary record. I am unable to accept those submissions, for several 
  reasons.</p>
<p>
  [29] First, the motions judge considered the Anns test and the Cooper, Edwards 
  and Rogers decisions, and correctly addressed the governing legal principles 
  established in those cases. In connection with the first branch of the Anns 
  test she held: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In my view the IDA's obligation is to protect investors generally and the public 
  in general. It does not extend to any particular investor, notwithstanding a 
  complaint about a member. </p>
<p>
  [30] I agree. The IDA, as recognized by the Commission, is organized for the 
  purposes of regulating the standards of practice and business conduct of its 
  member firms and their representatives to promote the protection of investors 
  and the public interest. Those purposes are not directed to individual investors 
  but, rather, to the investing public as a whole. Moreover, as observed by the 
  Supreme Court at p. 208 of Cooper: &quot;[A] duty to individual investors would 
  potentially conflict with the [regulator's] overarching duty to the public.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [31] Second, I also agree with the motions judge's conclusion that: &quot;Although 
  the IDA is not statutory, it nevertheless is cloaked with a similar array of 
  responsibilities as [the regulators in Cooper, Edwards and Rogers].&quot; Before 
  this court the appellants emphasize that the IDA is a voluntary association 
  not created by statute. Thus, the source of the IDA's duties are not determined 
  by statute. The appellants therefore argue that recognition of the IDA by the 
  Commission under the Act does not transform the IDA into a statutory tribunal 
  or otherwise vest it with the status of a government actor: Ripley v. Investment 
  Dealers Association of Canada (No. 2) (1990), 99 N.S.R. (2d) 338 (N.S.S.C.), 
  aff'd (1991), 108 N.S.R. (2d) 38 (N.S.C.A.) and Re Derivative Services Inc., 
  [1999] I.D.A.C.D. No. 29. </p>
<p>
  [32] While I agree with those submissions, it does not follow that the functions 
  and responsibilities of the IDA are divorced from any statutory context. The 
  IDA's relationship with the Commission and its recognition as a self-regulatory 
  organization under s. 21.1 of the Act link its activities to a statutory securities 
  scheme which, under s.1.1 of the Act, is designed to provide protection to all 
  investors in Canada from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices and to foster 
  fair and efficient capital markets and confidence in capital markets. As well, 
  at the time of the incidents relevant to this action, the conduct of the IDA's 
  affairs and the nature of its regulatory functions were not exclusively self-selected. 
  They were subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the Commission as a 
  condition of recognition as a self-regulatory organization under s. 21.1 of 
  the Act. In my view, those factors inform the analysis of the IDA's status and 
  duties as a regulator, notwithstanding that its relationship with its members 
  is contractual in nature.</p>
<p>
  [33] In addition, and in any event, as held by this court in Hughes v. Sunbeam 
  Corp. (Canada) Ltd. (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 433 (C.A.), leave to appeal to the 
  S.C.C. refused [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 446, the application of the principles enunciated 
  in Cooper and Edwards, including the Anns test, is not confined to statutory 
  bodies. </p>
<p>
  [34] Recognition of a duty of care must be justified on the basis of a sufficiently 
  close and direct relationship between the parties as to satisfy the foreseeability 
  and proximity requirements of the first branch of the Anns test. In some circumstances, 
  a sufficiently proximate relationship may be identified by reference to existing 
  categories of negligence in which a duty of care has been recognized. When a 
  case falls within one of those categories, or an analogous one, and reasonable 
  foreseeability of harm is established, a prima facie duty of care may be asserted. 
  Where, however, the claimed duty of care does not fall within a recognized category 
  of negligence and a new category is asserted, it is necessary to determine whether 
  the circumstances disclose foreseeability of harm and sufficient proximity to 
  justify the imposition of liability for negligence: Cooper, at pp. 201 and 203-6, 
  per McLachlin C.J.O. and Major J. </p>
<p>
  [35] The respondents do not argue here that the appellants' losses were not 
  reasonably foreseeable. As held in Cooper at p. 207, however, mere foreseeability 
  is insufficient to establish a prima facie duty of care. The first branch of 
  the Anns test also requires the demonstration of proximity. The appellants claim 
  that the proximity requirement is satisfied because the asserted facts against 
  the IDA parties establish a close and direct course of conduct between the IDA 
  parties and the appellants. That course of conduct is said to consist of the 
  complaint by the appellants to the IDA concerning the TK Co. parties, the receipt 
  of the complaint by the IDA, the follow-up by Mr. Morgis on behalf of the appellants 
  concerning the status of the complaint, and the alleged inaction of the IDA 
  in response to the complaint. </p>
<p>
  [36] In my view, those facts do not meet the proximity requirement of the Anns 
  test. The IDA's alleged duty of care, as framed by the appellants, is widely 
  cast. It is described as a duty owed to the appellants, as investors with TK 
  Co., to ensure compliance by an IDA member with the IDA's rules, regulations 
  and by-laws. That suggested duty is similar to the duty of care asserted against 
  the regulator and rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Edwards case. 
  Such a duty does not fall directly or by analogy within any category of cases 
  in which a duty of care has previously been recognized. Accordingly, the issue 
  is whether the IDA's status as a voluntary regulator, as distinct from a regulator 
  created and governed by statute, and the nature of the relationship between 
  the appellants and the IDA set this case apart from Cooper, Edwards and Rogers 
  such that a new category of negligence should be recognized.</p>
<p>
  [37] While it is true, as argued by the appellants, that the evidentiary record 
  in this action is incomplete at this early pleadings stage, the appellants are 
  bound by their own characterization of the IDA parties' alleged duty of care. 
  As described by the appellants, the claimed duty would be owed to all investing 
  members of the public who dealt with TK Co. Moreover, the asserted duty would 
  be owed by the IDA to all persons who complain about investments with any member 
  of the IDA. </p>
<p>
  [38] As well, the appellants' proximity argument rests on mere contact between 
  the appellants, as complainants, and the IDA. If such contact with a regulator 
  was itself sufficient to establish the close and direct relationship necessary 
  to satisfy a prima facie duty of care, the regulator would owe a duty of care 
  to all investors who lodge complaints, without regard to the merits of the complaints, 
  any subsequent action taken by the regulator, or the nature of the interaction 
  between the regulator and the complainants. It is noteworthy that in Edwards, 
  although a complaint was made to the regulator and an investigation was actually 
  undertaken, the regulator's duty of care was held by the Supreme Court of Canada 
  to be owed to the public at large. In this case, the suggested engagement of 
  the regulator with the complainants, which forms the basis of their alleged 
  relationship, is far less developed. As a result, the alleged duty of care is 
  even more remote than the duty of care asserted in Edwards.</p>
<p>
  [39] In addition, the appellants do not assert that the IDA parties assumed 
  responsibility to protect individual investors from economic loss if the investors' 
  dealings with an IDA member result in losses sustained in the capital markets. 
  Moreover, the asserted duty of care is said to be owed by the IDA. No facts 
  are alleged against the other IDA parties which would support a duty owed by 
  them in their personal capacities.</p>
<p>
  [40] Consequently, I am not persuaded that the circumstances of this case establish 
  a relationship between the parties sufficient to support a prima facie duty 
  of care owed by the IDA parties. The alleged relationship, in my view, does 
  not give rise to the proximity necessary to warrant the imposition of a duty 
  of care upon the IDA parties. Accordingly, the appellants' case against the 
  IDA parties is defeated on the first branch of the Anns test.</p>
<p>
  [41] I am also of the view that, even if it could be said that a duty of care 
  owed by the IDA parties might be established on a fuller evidentiary record 
  at trial, residual policy considerations would negate the duty, for several 
  reasons. </p>
<p>
  [42] As in Cooper and Rogers, the appellants' proposed claims against the IDA 
  parties raise the potential for indeterminate liability in an indeterminate 
  amount. The appellants do not suggest that the IDA has the means of controlling 
  the number of investors who engage the services of its members; nor is it suggested 
  that the IDA can control the number of investors who choose to complain to it 
  regarding IDA member conduct, or the amount of money invested in the capital 
  markets through securities dealers who belong to the IDA. The motions judge 
  correctly observed that the issue of indeterminate liability is a limiting principle 
  in economic loss claims and that the IDA is powerless to limit potential claims 
  from all investors of all member IDA firms.</p>
<p>
  [43] I also agree with the motions judge's conclusion that the effect of imposing 
  a duty of care on the IDA parties in the circumstances of this case would be 
  to create indirectly &quot;an insurance scheme for dissatisfied investors who 
  have paid the IDA nothing.&quot; It is noteworthy that the Commission's 1994 
  recognition of the IDA as a self-regulatory organization under the Act confirmed 
  the existence of an investor protection fund, financed by IDA members, to protect 
  investors against losses arising from dealer failures to a maximum specified 
  amount. Such a fund functions as a safeguard, apart from a private law of duty 
  of care, to ensure in some circumstances the protection and compensation of 
  members of the public who invest through securities dealers: see, for example 
  and in connection with the compensation fund maintained by the legal profession 
  in Ontario, Edwards at 219.</p>
<p>
  [44] It is also significant that the IDA has authority to investigate and to 
  discipline its members and that it suspended the membership of TK Co. in the 
  IDA in July 2002. Chief Justice McLachlin and Justice Major observed in Cooper 
  at p. 210: </p>
<p class="indent"> The decision of whether to suspend a broker involves both policy 
  and quasi-judicial elements. The decision requires the Registrar to balance 
  the public and private interests&#133;The Registrar must act fairly or judicially 
  in removing a broker's licence. These requirements are inconsistent with a duty 
  of care to investors.</p>
<p class="indent">Those comments are apposite here. The decision to suspend the 
  membership of a dealer in a voluntary organization like the IDA cannot be made 
  lightly; a suspension decision must be made in good faith, with a view to the 
  consequences for both the member and its clients, and in accordance with the 
  rules of natural justice. Those requirements oblige the IDA to act fairly in 
  its dealing with members. Thus, its decisions affecting members require the 
  balancing of both public and private interests.</p>
<p>
  [45] Finally, it is appropriate to recognize that, unlike the regulators in 
  Cooper, Edwards and Rogers, the IDA does not enjoy the protection of a statutory 
  exemption from suit provision. The appellants argue that the effect of not imposing 
  a duty of care on the IDA parties, or allowing for the possible recognition 
  of such a duty following a trial, is to provide the IDA with an exemption or 
  immunity from suit not otherwise legally available to it. That submission, in 
  my view, overstates the significance of a statutory exemption from suit provision. 
  Such a protection is only one factor to be taken into account in determining, 
  under the second stage of the Anns test, whether policy reasons exist to negate 
  a duty of care. As the decision of this court in Hughes illustrates, the absence 
  of such a provision is not determinative of the policy-based analysis mandated 
  by the Anns test. </p>
<p>
  VI. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [46] Accordingly, for the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal. The IDA 
  parties are entitled to their costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis, 
  fixed in the amount of $8,500, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services 
  Tax.</p>
