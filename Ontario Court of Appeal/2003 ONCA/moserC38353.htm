<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Hugh M. O'Connell of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated May 8, 2002.</p>

<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>
  [1] The application judge has dealt with these parties on many occasions and 
  is intimately familiar with the complex proceedings that have resulted in dozens 
  of orders both in the various matrimonial proceedings and the bankruptcy proceedings. 
  The only issue before us is the very narrow one of whether the application judge 
  had jurisdiction to make an order that the appellant convey the cottage property 
  to Diane Pirner. We have concluded that he had no jurisdiction to make that 
  order and accordingly we allow the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [2] In his very thorough and helpful reasons the application judge set out the 
  basis for the order in these terms:</p>
<p class="indent"> As the judgment [of Jennings J.] speaks, the conveyance from 
  its date of transfer by the Trustees is void.</p>
<p class="indent">. . .</p>
<p class="indent">It is also to be noted that Justice Jennings found that Diane 
  Pirner was entitled to a declaration setting aside the transfer to the trust. 
  Despite this, Diane Pirner did not receive a declaration as per the other provisions 
  of Justice Jenning's judgment. However, his judgment did allow for the posting 
  of security, which I am, in effect, doing at this time.</p>
<p class="indent">In order to satisfy the security required under Justice Jenning's 
  judgment and this motion and to put a stop to the never-ending litigation that 
  has consumed the parties, I order that the title of the cottage property be 
  transferred to and vested in Diane Pirner. In addition, the promissory note 
  given to Mr. Pirner as security for his investment in the company shall be transferred 
  to Mrs. Pirner by the Trustee.</p>
<p class="indent">This results in the cottage and promissory note being security 
  for the payment ordered by Justice Jennings under the marriage contract, the 
  child support arrears I ordered as of December 2000, and ongoing child support 
  as ordered until the balance of the equity in the cottage is used up and the 
  proceeds collected on the promissory note. The equity is based on the value 
  of the cottage as of June 18, 2001. My order is pursuant to section 21 of the 
  Family Law Act, paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Jennings' judgment, and the security 
  as requested in this motion. It is obvious from the affidavits filed, that the 
  cottage has value greatly in excess of the security requested [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [3] As is apparent from these reasons, the basis for the order dates back to 
  the divorce judgment made by Jennings J. in 1994. At that time, he found that 
  the cottage was the matrimonial home and that the conveyance from Thomas Pirner 
  to the Pirner Family Trust without Diane Pirner's consent was therefore in violation 
  of s. 21(1) of the Family Law Act. However, Jennings J. did not set aside the 
  transfer. Instead he held as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> Accordingly, provided that the husband complies within 45 days 
  with the orders for lump sum payments that I order to be made in the balance 
  of this judgment, no order under section 21 shall issue. If he should fail to 
  do so, counsel may move before me on notice for such an order and for an order 
  securing support payments against the cottage property.</p>
<p>
  [4] This became paragraph 15 of the Judgment of Jennings J., which was in these 
  terms:</p>
<p class="indent"> THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that if the payment is made 
  by the Husband pursuant to paragraphs 13 and 14 hereof, no order under section 
  21 of The Family Law Act shall issue against the cottage property &#133; If 
  the Husband fails to do so, counsel for the Wife may move before the Honourable 
  Mr. Justice Jennings on notice for such an order pursuant to section 21 of The 
  Family Law Act to secure the payments pursuant to paragraphs 13 and 14 against 
  the said property.</p>
<p>
  [5] Mr. Pirner made only the payment required by paragraph 14 (spousal support). 
  He did not make the payment ordered by paragraph 13 (required by the marriage 
  contract). Both parties appealed the judgment of Jennings J. to this court. 
  Those appeals were ultimately either abandoned or dismissed for want of perfection. 
  In 1995, Diane Pirner moved before Jennings J. to secure the equalization payment 
  against the cottage but he declined to act, apparently because of the pending 
  appeal. In March 1995, the Pirner Family Trust transferred the cottage to the 
  appellant, one of the beneficiaries of the trust. </p>
<p>
  [6] There have been numerous proceedings since then, including an attempt at 
  arbitration before Walsh J. In 1997, Jarvis J. set aside the arbitration award 
  and ordered Diane Pirner to remove all encumbrances from the cottage property 
  and from a property in Toronto. A motion by Diane Pirner in 1999 to set aside 
  that judgment on the basis of fraud was dismissed. At that time, the application 
  judge found that the appellant was not a &quot;straw person&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [7] We have some doubt that it is still open to Ms. Pirner to rely upon paragraph 
  15 of the judgment of Jennings J. given the many intervening proceedings. However, 
  at different times judges of the Superior Court of Justice and the General Division 
  with great familiarity with these proceedings have apparently proceeded on the 
  basis that the paragraph 15 procedure is still a live issue. See for example 
  Pirner-Moser v. Pirner, [1998] O.J. No. 2245 per Smith A.C.J.O.C. We have therefore 
  proceeded accordingly.</p>
<p>
  [8] The application that launched the proceedings that led to this appeal was 
  an application by the appellant to require Ms. Pirner to remove all encumbrances 
  from the Toronto property. In a cross-application, Ms. Pirner sought an order 
  setting aside the conveyance of the cottage property to the appellant. That 
  cross-application was based on the Fraudulent Conveyances Act and the Assignments 
  and Preferences Act. The application judge dismissed those applications. This 
  left only the possibility that an order could be made against the property under 
  s. 21 of the Family Law Act, on its own, or in accordance with paragraph 15 
  of the judgment of Jennings J.</p>
<p> [9] The application judge held that Jennings J. had found that the conveyance 
  of the cottage to the Pirner Family Trust was void. In our view, the application 
  judge erred in that respect. The conveyance was voidable<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  and Jennings J. did not set it aside. </p>
<p> [10] The appellant submits that once the parties were divorced, the jurisdiction 
  under s. 21 of the Family Law Act lapsed and the application could no longer 
  declare the conveyance void. We need not decide that issue since even if the 
  application judge still retained jurisdiction under the Family Law Act, because 
  of paragraph 15 of the judgment of Jennings J., he had no jurisdiction to order 
  that the appellant convey the property to Ms. Pirner. As we have said, the application 
  judge had already found that the appellant was not a &quot;straw person&quot; 
  and that the original conveyance could not be set aside under the Fraudulent 
  Conveyances Act and the Assignments and Preferences Act. Assuming the Family 
  Law Act still applied, the application judge could have set aside the transaction 
  (s. 21) at which point the property would have revested in Mr. Pirner on conditions 
  that protected the appellant's rights (s. 23(d)). He could then have made a 
  charging order in favour of Ms. Pirner (s. 34). He could then have directed 
  a sale under s. 13, again ensuring that the rights of the appellant were protected. 
  But, he had no jurisdiction under the Act to order that the appellant convey 
  the property to Ms. Pirner.</p>
<p>
  [11] We note that the application judge recognized that &quot;the cottage has 
  value greatly in excess of the security requested&quot;. We also note the added 
  complexity because of Mr. Pirner's bankruptcy. Thus, once the transaction was 
  set aside it might well have vested not in Mr. Pirner but in the trustee.</p>
<p>
  [12] Leaving aside the bankruptcy, any legal or equitable interest that Mr. 
  Pirner had in the cottage might have been available to secure the various amounts 
  owed by Mr. Pirner to Ms. Pirner. However, the application judge did not refer 
  to any evidence that Mr. Pirner had any such interest in the cottage. </p>
<p>
  [13] We cannot see any alternative basis to justify the order made by the application 
  judge. In particular, the fact that at various time orders have apparently been 
  made that the cottage property secures the arrears, could not justify the order 
  made by the application judge. Accordingly, the appeal must be allowed and the 
  order set aside. </p>
<p>
  [14] As to costs, the appellant and Mr. Pirner will have ten days to submit 
  their bills of costs and to make brief written submissions. Ms. Pirner will 
  have ten days to respond and the appellant and Mr. Pirner will have five days 
  to reply to those submissions. The submissions should be filed with the Senior 
  Legal Officer.</p>
