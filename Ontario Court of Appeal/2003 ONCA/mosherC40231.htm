<p class="boldcenter">ADDENDUM</p>
<p>[1] Further to my endorsement released on September 3, 2003 in this matter, 
  I have received the written costs submissions of the Minister of Natural Resources. 
  Although provided with an opportunity to do so, the moving party, Donald B. 
  Mosher, has not filed any submissions on costs.</p>
<p>[2] On behalf of the Minister, the Crown seeks its reasonable costs of responding 
  to the unsuccessful stay motion brought by Mr. Mosher. In responding to the 
  motion, the Crown prepared a motion record, including affidavit materials, and 
  a factum. It also appeared before this court by teleconference on three separate 
  occasions concerning the motion. Further, it was ultimately successful in resisting 
  the requested stay.</p>
<p>[3] In my view, the Crown is entitled to costs of the motion on a partial indemnity 
  basis. The Crown seeks costs in that regard in the limited amount of $500. In 
  all the circumstances, I consider that amount to be more than reasonable. Accordingly, 
  the Crown is entitled to its costs of the motion, as sought, in the total amount 
  of $500.</p>
