<p>On appeal from the order of Justice William J. Festeryga of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated May 14, 2002.</p> <P>
  Laskin J.A.:</p> <P>
  [1] In September 1998, Robert Benton was a fourteen year-old Crown ward under 
  the care of the Halton Children's Aid Society (the &quot;Halton CAS&quot;). 
  He lived at Foundations Residence in Burlington, a residential treatment home 
  for youth operated for the Society by the respondent, Ontario Family Guidance 
  Centre Inc. (&quot;OFGC&quot;). In late August 1998, Robert left the residence 
  without permission. Nine days later, police officers spotted him driving a stolen 
  car in the City of Hamilton. The police followed him. Robert lost control of 
  the car and drove through the wall of the house owned by the appellants, Maria 
  and Manuel Mota. </p> <P>
  [2] Tragically, Robert Benton was killed in the accident and Mr. and Mrs. Mota 
  were injured. In December 1998, the Mota family started an action against the 
  Hamilton Wentworth Police Services and others, but not OFGC. Over three years 
  later, in February 2002, they moved to amend their statement of claim to add 
  OFGC as a defendant. Festeryga J. dismissed the motion. The Mota family appeals. 
  Their appeal raises two issues: </p> 
<P class="indent"> 1. Is OFGC protected by the six-month limitation period in 
  s. 7(1) of the Public Authorities Protection Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.38 (the 
  &quot;PAPA&quot;)? </p>
<P class="indent">2. If the answer to the first question is yes, did the motions 
  judge commit a reviewable error in exercising his discretion to dismiss the 
  appellants' motion?</p>
<P>
  [3] I would answer yes to the first question and no to the second question. 
  I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal. </p> <P>
  First Issue: Is OFGC protected by the six-month limitation period in s. 7(1) 
  of the Public Authorities Protection Act?</p> <P>
  [4] Section 7(1) of the PAPA states essentially that any action against a public 
  authority for failing to fulfil its public duties or to properly exercise its 
  public powers must be started within six months after the cause of action arose.</p> 
<P class="indent"> No action, prosecution or other proceeding lies or shall be 
  instituted against any person for an act done in pursuance or execution or intended 
  execution of any statutory or other public duty or authority, or in respect 
  of any alleged neglect or default in the execution of any such duty or authority, 
  unless it is commenced within six months next after the cause of action arose, 
  or, in the case of continuance of injury or damage, within six months after 
  the ceasing thereof. </p> 
<P>
  [5] The purpose of stringent limitation periods for public authorities was explained 
  by Binnie J. in Des Champs v. Conseil des &eacute;coles s&eacute;par&eacute;es 
  catholiques de langue fran&ccedil;aise de Prescott-Russell, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 
  281 at 286:</p> 
<P class="indent"> Many if not most public authorities in this country are shielded 
  from litigants to some extent by special statutory limitation periods. The public 
  policy underlying these limitations is that public authorities ought not to 
  be unduly prejudiced by the passage of time. Timely notice will promote the 
  timely investigation and disposition of claims in the public interest. After 
  the expiry of a limitation period, the public authority can consider itself 
  free of the threat of legal action, and need not preserve or seek out pertinent 
  evidence. Its fiscal planning can proceed free of the disrupting effect of unresolved 
  claims against the public purse. </p> 
<P>
  [6] In this case, the appellants sought to sue OFGC long after the six-month 
  limitation period had expired. Therefore, the first question before the motions 
  judge was whether OFGC was entitled to the protection of the PAPA. The motions 
  judge held that it was. </p> 
<P> [7] In their proposed amended statement of claim the appellants allege that 
  OFGC was negligent in failing to keep &quot;a reasonable watch&quot; over its 
  Crown ward, in failing to keep reasonable control of him, and in not taking 
  reasonable steps to find him after discovering he was missing. The motions judge 
  concluded that &quot;the actions or lack of actions by OFGC were undertaken 
  in pursuance or execution of a statutory duty i.e. CFSA&quot;, (the Child and 
  Family Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11), and, therefore, the six-month limitation 
  period applied. The appellants submit that the motions judge erred in his conclusion, 
  either because the OFGC was not a public authority, or if it was, its alleged 
  negligence amounted to a failure to exercise a private duty for which the protection 
  of the PAPA was not available. </p>
<P>
  [8] I do not agree with this submission. Even though s. 7 &quot;is to be read 
  restrictively and in favour of 'the person whose right of action is being truncated'&quot;, 
  I see no room for doubt in this case: see Des Champs, supra, at 313 citing Estey 
  J. in Berardinelli v. Ontario Housing Corp., [1979] 1 S.C.R. 275 at 280. The 
  OFGC is a public authority and its failure to properly supervise Robert Benton 
  would be a breach of its public duty under s. 15(3) of the CFSA. This becomes 
  apparent when the five-step approach to determining the application of s. 7(1) 
  of the PAPA recommended by Binnie J. in Des Champs, supra, at 313-14 is applied 
  to the facts of this case. </p> <P>
  (i) Is the OFGC a public authority within the class of entities for whom the 
  limitation protection was intended?</p> 
<P> [9] Children's aid societies, which are established under the CFSA, are entities 
  for whom the protection of the PAPA was intended. See Y.C. v. Children's Aid 
  Society of Metropolitan Toronto, [1998] O.J. No. 839 (Gen. Div.) and Skewes 
  v. Children's Aid Society of Hamilton-Wentworth (1982), 38 O.R. (2d) 578 (H.C.J.). 
  Agents carrying out public duties on a society's behalf are similarly entitled 
  to the protection of the PAPA. See Moffatt v. Dufferin County Board of Education, 
  [1973] 1 O.R. 351 (C.A.). OFGC was licenced under the CFSA and its corresponding 
  regulations to operate Foundations Residence. It entered into an agreement with 
  the Halton CAS to operate the residence on behalf of the Society. Thus, OFGC 
  was the Halton CAS's agent. OFGC is, therefore, a public authority within the 
  class of entities for whom the limitation protection was intended. </p>
<P>
  (ii) What was the OFGC doing and under what duty or power was it doing it?</p> <P>
  [10] OFGC was operating a children's treatment home for the Halton CAS. It was 
  licenced to do so under s. 193 of the CFSA, which provides:</p> 
<P class="indent"> 193(1) No person shall,</p>
<P class="indent">(a) establish, operate or maintain a children's residence; or 
</p>
<P class="indent">(b) provide, directly or indirectly, residential care for three 
  or more children not of common parentage in places that are not children's residences, 
</p>
<P class="indent">except under the authority of a licence issued by a Director 
  under this Part.</p>
<P>
  [11] It had agreed to operate this home under the terms of a written agreement 
  with the Halton CAS.</p> <P>
  (iii) Is the power or duty relied on as part of the appellants' cause of action 
  properly classified as containing &quot;a public aspect or connotation&quot; 
  or is it more readily classifiable as &quot;private executive or private administrative&#133; 
  or subordinate in nature&quot;?</p> <P>
  [12] Some of the powers and duties exercised by public authorities are public; 
  others are private. Only the exercise of public powers and duties attracts the 
  protection of the limitation period. </p> <P>
  [13] Virtually all public authorities operate under a statutory regime, and, 
  consequently, most of their powers and duties are listed in a statute. However, 
  that fact alone does not mean that the power or duty in question should be classified 
  as public. A public duty is one that meets two other requirements. First, it 
  is a &quot;duty owed to all the public alike&quot;, not a duty owed to a particular 
  person because of, for example, a private contract. See Bradford Corp. v. Myers, 
  [1916] 1 A.C. 242 at 247 (H.L.). Second, the duty must not be subordinate to, 
  or too remote from, the public authority's public role. See Berardinelli, supra 
  at 283.</p> <P>
  [14] In this case, the appellants claim that OFGC had a duty which it breached 
  to supervise Robert Benton, to control him, and to take steps to find him after 
  he left the Residence. These duties are found in s. 15(3) of the CFSA, which 
  lists the functions of children's aid societies and of entities such as OFGC, 
  which operate children's residences for a society. The three functions or duties 
  of OFGC that relate to the appellants' claim are set out in s. 15(3)(b), (d) 
  and (e):</p> 
<P class="indent"> 15(3) Functions of society - The functions of a children's 
  aid society are to,</p>
<P class="indent">&#133; </p>
<P class="indent">(b) protect, where necessary, children who are under the age 
  of sixteen years or are in the society's care or under its supervision;</p>
<P class="indent">&#133;</p>
<P class="indent">(d) provide care for children assigned or committed to its care 
  under this Act;</p>
<P class="indent">(e) supervise children assigned to its supervision under this 
  Act.</p>
<P>
  [15] These duties have a public, not a private, aspect. Once the Halton CAS 
  determined that Robert Benton was in need of protection and placed him at Foundations 
  Residence, the OFGC owed a duty to protect, care for, and supervise him. These 
  duties were owed not just to one particular person not even just to Robert Benton's 
  family but to all members of the public. These duties were not subordinate to 
  OFGC's public role. They lay at the very core of that role. They are similar 
  to a public school board's duty to operate a safe school, which Binnie J. recognized 
  as a public duty in Des Champs. Therefore, the duties relied on by the appellants 
  in their claim must be classified &quot;as entailing a public aspect&quot;.</p> <P>
  (iv) Is the activity of OFGC that is the subject matter of the complaint &quot;inherently 
  of a public nature&quot; or is it more of &quot;an internal or operational nature 
  having a predominantly private aspect&quot;?</p> <P>
  [16] Any public authority undoubtedly engages in a wide range of actions or 
  activities. Many of these activities may fairly be said to come within a public 
  authority's public mandate. But as Estey J. pointed out in Berardinelli, supra, 
  not even all of the activities within the authority's public mandate are entitled 
  to the protection of the limitation period. Some of the authority's public managerial 
  activities are so mundane or routine in Berardinelli, snow removal by a public 
  housing authority that they do not justify the protection of the PAPA. These 
  routine activities may be classified as predominantly internal or operational.</p> <P>
  [17] This fourth step, therefore, focuses on whether the activity of the public 
  authority complained of by a plaintiff is primarily public, or primarily internal 
  or operational. This distinction avoids creating double standards for the routine 
  activities of a public authority. In other words, permitting a public authority 
  to claim the protection of the PAPA for an activity as routine as snow removal 
  unfairly disadvantages a plaintiff injured on the icy steps of a housing authority 
  complex compared to a plaintiff injured on the icy steps of a privately owned 
  apartment building. In the first case, the plaintiff has six months to sue; 
  in the second case, the plaintiff has six years. </p> <P>
  [18] The appellants contend that the Halton CAS's alleged failure to supervise 
  Robert Benton is no different from a housing authority's failure to clean the 
  ice and snow in Berardinelli. I do not agree. The appellants' submission, however, 
  is supported by the decision of Kurisko J. in L. (D.) v. Children's Aid Society 
  of the District of Thunder Bay, [1987] O.J. No. 1461 (Dist Ct.). In that case, 
  a young boy who had been taken into custody by the Thunder Bay Children's Aid 
  Society and placed in a group home, stabbed and killed a resident of the group 
  home, and stabbed and seriously wounded an employee of the Society. The boy's 
  parents and siblings sued the Children's Aid Society for damages for negligent 
  supervision, but did not start the action until more than a year after the stabbing. 
  The Children's Aid Society moved to dismiss the claim on the ground that it 
  was barred by the six-month limitation period in the PAPA.</p> <P>
  [19] Kurisko J. held that the claim was not statute barred because the day to 
  day care and supervision of a child in a group home was &quot;internal or operational 
  in nature having a predominantly private aspect&quot;. He wrote:</p> 
<P class="indent"> In Berardinelli the Supreme Court of Canada held that removal 
  of snow from public access portions of a public housing complex is not a phase 
  of activity which has &quot;a direct public purpose&quot; or which has &quot;a 
  public aspect&quot;. The court described this activity as predominantly in character 
  a &quot;subordinate&quot; or &quot;incidental&quot; act. &quot;It is something 
  done every winter by almost every householder in Canada.&quot; If the foregoing 
  can be said of snow removal from public access portions of a public housing 
  complex I have no difficulty concluding that day to day care and supervision 
  of a child residing in a group home operated by the Society is not a phase of 
  activity which has &quot;a direct public purpose&quot; or which has &quot;a 
  public aspect&quot;. Such care and supervision is internal or operational in 
  nature having a predominantly private aspect. Caring for a child is a duty performed 
  on a daily basis by every conscientious parent or guardian. It is a duty owing 
  primarily to the child as opposed to the public. </p> 
<P>
  [20] The Thunder Bay case was decided before Des Champs. Kurisko J., therefore, 
  did not have the benefit of Binnie J.'s analysis. In my view, Kurisko J.'s reasoning 
  is inconsistent with that analysis. A children's aid society's day to day supervision 
  of a child in need of protection cannot fairly be equated to a housing authority's 
  removal of snow and ice from a sidewalk. Snow removal was an obviously routine 
  or subordinate activity in Berardinelli, but I see nothing routine or subordinate 
  about the activity of supervising a child entrusted to a group home's care. 
  This is a very public activity. Indeed, it is central to the group home's public 
  mandate. Therefore, the activity of OFGC that forms the subject matter of the 
  appellants' complaint failing to supervise Robert Benton properly and failing 
  to take steps to find him are, in the words of Estey J., &quot;inherently of 
  a public nature&quot;: see Berardinelli, supra, at 284.</p> <P>
  (v) From the appellants' perspective, does their claim &quot;correlate&quot; 
  to OFGC's exercise of a public power or duty, or does it relate to the breach 
  of a public duty, or does it complain about an activity of a public character?</p> <P>
  [21] This is the critical step in the inquiry. If the answer to question (v) 
  is yes, then the limitation period applies. </p> 
<P> [22] This fifth question requires the court to consider the nature of the 
  plaintiff's claim and assess whether it correlates to the public authority's 
  public duty. In other words, once the public authority owes a duty to &quot;all 
  the public alike&quot;, then any claim against the public authority that is 
  correlative to that duty attracts the protection of the PAPA. Conversely, any 
  claim against the public authority that is rooted in contract or in another 
  kind of private relationship will not gain the benefit of the limitation period. 
</p>
<P>
  [23] In this case, the appellants' claim against OFGC correlates exactly with 
  OFGC's public duties. The appellants allege that OFGC failed to properly supervise 
  and control Robert Benton, and failed to take reasonable steps to find him after 
  he was discovered missing. These allegations correspond to OFGC's public mandate 
  in s. 15(3) of the CFSA to protect, care for, and supervise children assigned 
  to its supervision. I would, therefore, answer yes to this fifth question and 
  hold that OFGC can rely on the limitation period in s. 7(1) of the Act.</p> <P>
  Second Issue: Did the motions judge commit a reviewable error in exercising 
  his discretion to dismiss the appellants' motion?</p> <P>
  [24] The application of the limitation period does not automatically foreclose 
  the appellants' motion to add OFGC as a defendant. Under subrule 5.04(2) of 
  the Rules of Civil Procedure, the court retains discretion &quot;at any stage 
  of a proceeding&quot; to add a party to an action &quot;on such terms as are 
  just, unless prejudice would result that could not be compensated for by costs 
  or an adjournment.&quot; A court can invoke this rule in a case such as this, 
  by adding a defendant to an existing action even though the limitation period 
  applicable to that defendant has expired. See, for example, Deaville v. Boegeman 
  (1984), 48 O.R. (2d) 725 (C.A.) and Mazzuca v. Silvercreek Pharmacy Ltd. (2001), 
  56 O.R. (3d) 768 (C.A). </p> <P>
  [25] In this case, however, the motions judge exercised his discretion by refusing 
  to add OFGC after the expiry of the six-month limitation period in the PAPA. 
  He held that the expiry of the limitation period created a presumption of prejudice 
  which the appellants had failed to rebut. He also held that there were no special 
  circumstances justifying the proposed addition of OFGC. </p> <P>
  [26] The appellants submit that the motions judge erred because he based his 
  dismissal of the motion on presumed, not actual prejudice. Because OFGC led 
  no evidence that it would actually be prejudiced by the proposed amendment, 
  the motions judge should have added OFGC as a defendant in the action. </p> <P>
  [27] There are three obstacles to accepting the appellants' submission: (1) 
  the order of the motions judge is entitled to deference; (2) the appellants 
  made no attempt to locate OFGC for over three years after the accident; and 
  (3) the appellants have not shown OFGC would not be prejudiced by the amendment.</p> <P>
  [28] Because the order of the motions judge refusing the amendment under subrule 
  5.04(2) is discretionary, it is entitled to deference from a reviewing court. 
  It should be set aside only if it reflects an error in principle or is otherwise 
  unreasonable. As I will discuss, I am not persuaded that the motions judge committed 
  a reviewable error in the exercise of his discretion.</p> <P>
  [29] An important consideration supporting the motions judge's order was the 
  appellants' inaction for over three years after the accident. The accident occurred 
  in September 1998. The appellants (or their counsel) were told in February 1999 
  that Robert Benton had been placed at FGI Foundations in Burlington. However, 
  they took no steps to find OFGC until February 2002. FGI is the trade name for 
  OFGC, which is the legal entity. Ordinary corporate and telephone directory 
  searches would have disclosed OFGC's existence and its operation of Foundations 
  Residence in Burlington. The appellants offered no explanation for why they 
  waited so long to conduct these searches.</p> <P>
  [30] The following brief chronology shows what occurred and when it occurred:</p> <P>
  &middot; May 5, 1998: Halton CAS places Robert Benton at Foundations Residence 
  in Burlington.</p> <P>
  &middot; August 27, 1998: Robert Benton leaves Foundations Residence without 
  permission.</p> <P>
  &middot; September 5, 1998: the car accident occurs.</p> <P>
  &middot; December 4, 1998: the Mota family issues a statement of claim, but 
  does not name either OFGC or FGI as a defendant. </p> <P>
  &middot; February 2, 1999: the lawyers for the estate of Robert Benton inform 
  the lawyers for Mr. and Mrs. Mota that Robert Benton had been a Crown ward placed 
  with FGI Foundations in Burlington at the time of the accident.</p> <P>
  &middot; August 19, 1999: the Mota family moves to add FGI Foundations and the 
  Children's Aid Society of Hamilton Wentworth as defendants. They try unsuccessfully 
  to serve FGI Foundations at the Hamilton Wentworth Society's offices in Hamilton. 
  OFGC do not operate any facilities there and, accordingly, received no notice 
  of the motion. </p> <P>
  &middot; February 7, 2002: lawyers for Mr. and Mrs. Mota conduct corporate searches.</p> <P>
  &middot; February 19, 2002: OFGC becomes aware of the lawsuit when it is served 
  with the motion record to add it as a defendant to the action.</p> <P>
  &middot; May 13, 2002: lawyers for Mr. and Mrs. Mota do telephone directory 
  searches.</p> <P>
  &middot; May 14, 2002: the Mota family brings its motion to add OFGC as a defendant. 
  </p> <P>
  [31] This chronology shows how this case differs from those in which an amendment 
  to add a party after the expiry of the limitation period has been allowed. Two 
  differences stand out. First, the proposed defendant OFGC had no knowledge of 
  the claim until over three years after the accident. If it was not misled, it 
  was certainly taken by surprise. This case, therefore, differs from a case such 
  as Mazzuca, where, from the outset, the defendant knew the substance of the 
  claim being asserted and the amendment simply substituted the correct corporate 
  name of the plaintiff. Second, the appellants have given no real explanation 
  for why they took no action to add OFGC for over three years after the accident. 
  In cases such as Mazzuca, the party who sought the court's indulgence there, 
  the plaintiff gave a reasonable explanation for not moving earlier. Thus, even 
  apart from the question of prejudice, I find it hard to see any compelling reason 
  to reverse the motions judge.</p> <P>
  [32] That being said, prejudice is an important factor in a motion under subrule 
  5.04(2). Oddly, therefore, the record is silent on the question of prejudice. 
  OFGC has filed no evidence that it would be prejudiced by the proposed amendment, 
  and the appellants have filed no evidence that OFGC would not be prejudiced 
  if it were added as a defendant. Absent evidence on either side, the question 
  of prejudice must be determined by the failure of the appellants to rebut the 
  presumption of prejudice. </p> <P>
  [33] In Deaville v. Boegeman, supra, at 730, MacKinnon A.C.J.O. explained the 
  presumption of prejudice and the onus on the party seeking to rebut it.</p> 
<P class="indent"> Some courts have suggested that in applications of the nature 
  of the one in the instant case, limitation periods can be ignored. Limitation 
  periods, however, were not enacted to be ignored. It has also been suggested 
  that the mere bringing of such an application as in the instant case immediately 
  shifts the burden of establishing prejudice to the defendant. I do not agree. 
  In my view, the expiry of the limitation period creates a presumption, however 
  slight in some cases, of prejudice to the defendant. It may be that the mere 
  recitation of the facts and history of the case makes it clear there is no prejudice 
  to the defendant and it can be inferred that he knew, within the limitation 
  period, of the case and the nature of the claims now being made against him. 
  Alternatively the defendant may file material which establishes prejudice. If 
  matters are left in balance, the usual rules apply and the applicant upon whom 
  the burden lies has not discharged that burden. The facts of the case and the 
  claims and the history of the dealings with the defendant are within the knowledge 
  of the plaintiff and there is no unfairness in placing upon the plaintiff the 
  burden of establishing those facts.</p> 
<P>
  [34] In this case, the mere passage of time has created a presumption that OFGC 
  would be prejudiced by the amendment. Although that prejudice cannot be measured, 
  it must be taken to exist unless the appellants can show otherwise. Conversely, 
  on the unusual record in this case, OFGC was not required to put forward evidence 
  of actual prejudice. It was entitled to rely on the presumption of prejudice 
  because the appellants led no evidence to suggest otherwise. The appellants, 
  therefore, cannot meet the requirements of subrule 5.04(2). They have not shown 
  that adding OFGC after the expiry of the limitation period would not result 
  in prejudice that could not be compensated for by costs. </p> <P>
  [35] For these reasons I see no error in the motions judge's order dismissing 
  the motion to add OFGC as a defendant. I would dismiss the appeal with costs 
  on a partial indemnity basis fixed at $5,000, inclusive of disbursements and 
  Goods and Services Tax.</p>
