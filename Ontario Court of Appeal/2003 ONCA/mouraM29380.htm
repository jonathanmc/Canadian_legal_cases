<p>MORDEN J.A.:</p><p>
  [1] This is an application to re-open an appeal that this court decided on August 
  10, 2000. The court's reasons, under the title of R. v. Babes, are reported 
  at 146 C.C.C. (3d) 465. The formal judgment was signed and entered. Leave to 
  appeal from the judgment to the Supreme of Canada was refused: 151 C.C.C. (3d) 
  vi.</p><p>
  [2] The applicants are an appellant in the appeal (Domingos Manuel Moura) and 
  four interveners in the appeal who, as a condition of participating in the appeal, 
  are bound by its result.</p><p>
  [3] At the conclusion of these reasons I express my opinion that the application 
  should be dismissed because the forum with jurisdiction to grant the relief 
  sought is the Superior Court and not this court. However, because of some of 
  the issues raised by the Crown, I have dealt with the application at greater 
  length than would otherwise be the case.</p><p>
  The Proceedings to the Present</p><p>
  [4] The history of the proceedings to and including the judgment of August 10, 
  2000 is set forth in the court's reasons and need not be repeated in detail. 
  It is sufficient to note at this point that the judgment was given in an application 
  commenced by the federal Crown under s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 
  1985, c. C-5 for &quot;an order sustaining the objections by the Crown made 
  at the preliminary hearing of the respondents before the Honourable Judge Bassel 
  on April 14, 1999 concerning questions which may reveal the identity of the 
  police informant&quot; and &quot;an order allowing this application and declaring 
  that the information sought is privileged&quot;. The application succeeded before 
  Humphrey J. on July 20, 1999. He concluded that &quot;the order will go as requested&quot;. 
  On August 10, 2000 this court dismissed the appeal of the respondent Moura and 
  others from this decision.</p><p>
  [5] As may be seen from this brief outline, the issue was whether the Crown 
  was obliged to disclose the identity of an individual. This individual was referred 
  to in the evidence at the preliminary inquiry as &quot;Informant #1&quot;. The 
  issue turned squarely on whether this person was a police agent, in which case 
  the Crown would be obliged to disclose his or her identity, or a police informer, 
  in which case the Crown would be under a duty not to disclose the person's identity.</p><p>
  [6] The preliminary inquiry judge, Bassel J., had ruled that Informant #1 was 
  a police agent. This ruling was the basis of the Crown's decision to apply under 
  s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act. As indicated, both Humphrey J. and this court 
  came to the opposite conclusion from that of Bassel J. and held that the Crown 
  was entitled to the relief it sought in the application.</p><p>
  [7] The evidence in the application included affidavits of Detective Cavanaugh 
  of the Ontario Provincial Police, which had been sworn in support of applications 
  for authorizations to intercept private communications, and transcripts of the 
  cross-examination of Detective Cavanaugh at the preliminary inquiry. It is not 
  necessary for the purpose of these reasons to set forth this evidence at any 
  length. It is sufficient to say that the evidence upon which Humphrey J. and 
  this court relied was unequivocally to the effect that Informant #1 was a police 
  informer and not a police agent. As I shall indicate in the next part of these 
  reasons, the Crown has subsequently disclosed evidence which contradicted the 
  evidence on which we relied. This is not disputed by the Crown.</p><p>
  The Current Proceedings</p><p>
  [8] The proceedings are now at the trial stage before Justice John Macdonald. 
  Several pre-trial motions were made before him. One of them related to outstanding 
  disclosure to be made by the Crown, a Stinchcombe application. This motion became 
  unnecessary because prosecuting counsel voluntarily provided the disclosure 
  sought.</p><p>
  [9] From this disclosure, defence counsel learned two important pieces of information.</p><p>
  [10] First, it learned that Detective Cavanaugh had destroyed the investigative 
  file that had been used to draft the affidavits that he swore in order to obtain 
  the authorizations. Based on this information, the appellant brought an application 
  for a stay of proceedings, the Carosella application.</p><p>
  [11] Second, the applicants learned that Informant #1, contrary to Detective 
  Cavanaugh's testimony on which Humphrey J. and this court relied, had been a 
  police agent in relation to matters relevant to the proceedings before the preliminary 
  inquiry judge and to the s. 37 application. This was revealed in a summary of 
  those portions of his affidavits that had been edited (i.e., blacked out) when 
  first disclosed to the defence. As indicated earlier, it is not necessary to 
  set forth this evidence. The Crown concedes that it contradicted the evidence 
  on which Humphrey J. and this court relied and that, as a result, our judgment 
  is &quot;not binding&quot;. It does not concede, however, that our conclusion 
  is wrong.</p><p>
  [12] Based on the new information, the applicants brought another application 
  for stay of proceedings which was called the &quot;Babes application&quot;.</p><p>
  [13] The argument on these two applications began near the end of August 2002. 
  At that time, Macdonald J. ruled that he would reserve judgment on each of them 
  until the evidence had been heard on a third application, a Garofoli application. 
  It was at this point that counsel for the applicants, in response to an earlier 
  question by the judge related to seeking relief from this court, informed him 
  that they would apply to this court to re-open the matter. This has now been 
  done.</p><p>
  [14] The stated ground in the notice of application to set aside our judgment 
  is that &quot;this Honourable Court was misled by false evidence in its original 
  decision in this matter&quot;.</p><p>
  The Issues Raised and their Resolution</p><p>
  [15] It is convenient to begin with the statement of the Crown's response to 
  this application. The Crown's &quot;principal position&quot; is that this application 
  is unnecessary because there is another forum in which the applicants may seek 
  relief. This forum is the trial court and before this court the Crown will take 
  the position that our order is not binding because it is &quot;based on an incomplete 
  and inaccurate record&quot;. Accordingly, the Crown submits that the question 
  of the true status of Informant #1 can be &quot;re-litigated&quot;.</p><p>
  [16] The Crown's next position is that this court lacks the jurisdiction to 
  set aside the order because the appeal was &quot;heard on its merits&quot;, 
  citing R. v. H (E.F.); R. v. Rhingo (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 89 at 101 (Ont. 
  C.A.).</p><p>
  [17] It may be noted at the outset that the Crown's primary position does not 
  involve the assertion that the court lacks jurisdiction to set aside the judgment. 
  It is merely that, if the court has jurisdiction, it should decline to exercise 
  it because there is another forum which can deal with the matter.</p><p>
  [18] I do not think that this submission has merit. It pays no recognition to 
  the fact that the court has an interest in the integrity of its process. I shall 
  say more on this shortly. Related to this, it fails to recognize that the Crown 
  itself decided that the s. 37 application was the proper proceeding to resolve 
  the question of its duty to disclose the identity of Informant #1 for the purposes 
  of the proceeding as a whole and not just the preliminary inquiry. All parties, 
  including the interveners, were to be bound by the decision made on it, even 
  though the interveners were not &quot;parties&quot; before the preliminary inquiry 
  judge. No doubt, if the Crown, through its action or inaction (I need not characterize 
  its conduct more precisely), had not rendered the order made &quot;not binding&quot;, 
  it would, rightly, have taken the position that the s. 37 decision was binding 
  on all parties throughout the proceeding. It is not right that it should now 
  take the position that the question should be re-litigated from the start in 
  a different forum as part of the trial which is now in progress, and that the 
  s. 37 proceeding, including the appeal to this court, can simply be forgotten, 
  as if it never happened.</p><p>
  [19] Accordingly, I turn now to the Crown's second position which relates to 
  the jurisdiction of the court to re-open the appeal, more specifically, to the 
  first step in this process, to set aside its order. (I am now using the term 
  &quot;the court&quot; in an inclusive sense. As indicated in paragraph 3 above 
  and explained in paragraph 24 below, in this case the particular court that 
  has the jurisdiction to grant the relief sought is the Superior Court.) The 
  court has an inherent jurisdiction to guard against the abuse of its process 
  and to rectify miscarriages of justice. Specifically, the court has the power 
  to set aside a judgment obtained by fraud or perjured evidence or where the 
  judgment cannot stand in the light of newly discovered evidence. I refer to 
  the following passage in the reasons of Estey J.A. in 100 Main Street East Ltd. 
  v. Sakas (1975), 8 O.R. (2d) 385 (C.A.) at 389 respecting what must be shown 
  to have a judgment set aside on these bases:</p>
<p class="indent"> The important distinction between the consequences 
  in law of the discovery of new evidence generally, and new evidence or circumstances 
  revealing fraud, is the subject of an observation by Lord Buckmaster in Hip 
  Foong Hong v. H. Neotia &amp; Co., [1918] A.C. 888 at 894:</p>
<p class="indent15"> &#133; the applicant must go further and show that the [new] 
  evidence was of such a character that it would, so far as can be foreseen have 
  formed a determining factor in the result. Such considerations do not apply 
  to questions of surprise, and still less to questions of fraud. A judgment that 
  is tainted and affected by fraudulent conduct is tainted throughout, and the 
  whole must fail;</p>
<p class="indent"> These authorities make it clear that new evidence of 
  fraud must related to the &quot;foundation&quot; of the decision or be &quot;material&quot; 
  to the claim or defence, but need not necessarily amount to a &quot;determining 
  factor in the result&quot;.</p>
<p> [20] Before returning to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, I should 
  say something about the Crown's reliance on the statement in R. v. H. (E.F.); 
  R. v. Rhingo, supra, to the effect that the court lacks jurisdiction to set 
  aside an order made on an appeal &quot;heard on its merits&quot;. I do not think 
  that this decision is applicable to the present case. It was concerned with 
  appeals from convictions. With respect to convictions (and acquittals for that 
  matter), I am unaware of any authority in Canada entitling a party to apply 
  to a court to have a conviction set aside on the basis of newly discovered evidence 
  after all appeal rights have been exhausted and the final court is functus officio.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  In fact, in R. v. Liscomb (1961), 131 C.C.C. 418 (Alta. Sup. Ct. App. Div.), 
  an authority referred to in R. v. H. (E.F.); R. v. Rhingo at p. 106, note 10, 
  the court held that it did not have jurisdiction to re-open an appeal on the 
  ground of discovery of new evidence after the appeal had been dismissed. What 
  right of recourse there may be in the circumstances lies in an application to 
  the Minister of Justice under s. 690 of the Criminal Code. In the United States, 
  it appears that there is direct recourse by applying to the trial court in cases 
  of newly discovered evidence. See Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 
  33 and M. Friedland, Double Jeopardy (1969), at 276-77.</p>
<p>
  [21] I see no reason why the lack of jurisdiction to set aside a conviction 
  after appeal should be equally applicable to setting aside an order made under 
  s. 37 of the Canada Evidence Act, even in cases in which the application is 
  made in a criminal context. Accordingly, I think that recourse could be had 
  to the inherent jurisdiction of the court with respect to a s. 37 order that 
  has been upheld on appeal.</p><p>
  [22] On the assumption that there is jurisdiction to set aside a judgment based 
  on perjured evidence, the Crown has submitted that the alleged fraud is not 
  supported by the evidence, that is, that it is not shown that Detective Cavanaugh 
  intentionally misled the court. In this regard, it refers to an observation 
  of Macdonald J. in his ruling on the Carosella and Babes motions:</p>
<p class="indent"> In his testimony in respect of the stay applications 
  several days ago, Detective Cavanaugh was not confronted with the suggestion 
  that he had lied in this regard at the Preliminary Inquiry. He was not questioned 
  on these serious assertions. He has therefore not had the opportunity under 
  oath in court to respond to the allegation that he lied, and to be tested by 
  cross-examination upon any explanation which he may offer.</p>
<p>
  [23] The Crown also states that none of the Crown counsel involved in this matter 
  (either at the appeal or trial level) was actually aware of the previously edited 
  passage disclosed in May 2002. The Crown does acknowledge, however, that since 
  it had access to this material, it ought to have known of it. </p><p>
  [24] I have dealt, generally, with the jurisdiction to grant the relief of setting 
  aside the judgment of August 10, 2000 on the basis of newly discovered evidence, 
  by which term I include evidence of fraud or perjury. Accepting that this jurisdiction 
  exists, it appears that the relief must be sought in the court of first instance, 
  even if the judgment in question has been affirmed by an appellate court. See 
  Boswell v. Coaks (1894), 6 R. 167 (H.L.); Jeannette v. Michigan Central R.R. 
  Co. (1919), O.W.N. 137 (H.C.); McGuire v. Haugh, [1934] O.R. 9 (C.A.); Reeder 
  v. George E. Shiner, [1948] O.W.N. 501 (C.A.) affirmed [1949] S.C.R. viii, leave 
  to appeal to the P.C. granted [1949] S.C.R. vii; and International Corona Resources 
  Ltd. v. LAC Minerals Ltd. (1988), 66 O.R. (2d) 610 (H.C.). In Royal Trust Co. 
  v. Jones, [1962] S.C.R. 132 at 145-46 Cartwright J. said:</p>
<p class="indent"> An examination of the authorities leads me to the conclusion 
  that it has long been settled in England that the proper method of impeaching 
  a judgment of the High Court on the ground of fraud or of seeking to set it 
  aside on the ground of subsequently discovered evidence is by action, whether 
  or not the judgment which is attacked has been affirmed or otherwise dealt with 
  by the Court of Appeal or other appellate tribunal.</p>
<p>In Re Bell Estate, [1947] O.W.N. 801 (C.A.), this court did set aside an order 
  made by it &quot;without prejudice &#133; to &#133; the parties &#133; to move 
  before a single Judge in Court, for an order referring to the whole matter back 
  to the Master for inquiry &#133;&quot; but it seems clear that this order was 
  made on the consent of the parties.</p><p>
  [25] This allocation of jurisdiction makes sense because its exercise will frequently 
  entail fact finding. No doubt, if the serious findings sought by the applicants 
  are to be made, they can be much more properly made in the Superior Court after 
  an appropriate hearing.</p><p>
  [26] For these reasons I would dismiss the application without prejudice to 
  the right of the applicants to seek the relief sought by a proceeding in the 
  Superior Court.</p>
<p> &quot; J.W. Morden J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree A.M. Austin J.A.<br>
  &quot;I agree S.T. Goudge J.A.</p>
