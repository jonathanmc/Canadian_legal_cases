<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant, a young person, was found guilty of assault causing bodily 
  harm (two counts), mischief over $5,000 and failure to comply with a disposition. 
  Disposition for the offences was eighteen months secure custody and six months 
  probation, consecutive to the disposition that the appellant was then serving. 
  At the time of disposition, the appellant was serving a closed custody disposition 
  with a release date of December 2, 2002, which was to be followed by eighteen 
  months probation. The appellant seeks leave to appeal the disposition on the 
  grounds it was excessive.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The Crown concedes that the appeal should be allowed as the disposition 
  was &quot;harsh&quot; and the totality of twenty months of closed custody was 
  &quot;excessive&quot;. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] Fresh evidence admitted on consent shows that the appellant is aboriginal 
  and that she has made excellent progress while in the institution. The appellant's 
  aboriginal heritage had not been taken into consideration at the time of disposition.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] In our view, time served is a fit sentence. The appellant has served approximately 
  seven months in secure custody following the completion of her prior period 
  in secure custody. It is our view, as well, that six months probation in addition 
  to the eighteen month probation period already ordered is excessive.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Leave to appeal is allowed, the disposition appeal is granted and the disposition 
  is varied to time served. The six-month probation period is struck.</p>
