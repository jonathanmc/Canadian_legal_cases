<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Frances P. Kiteley of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 18, 2002.<br>
</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from the order of Kiteley J. dated September 18, 
  2002, denying the appellant's request to seal the entire court file in this 
  action and instead, ordering that certain parts of the file be expunged.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The appellant and the respondent are the parents of MT, born July 12, 1999. 
  The respondent began this action on February 13, 2002 to determine the parties' 
  parenting regime and resolve certain financial issues. Subsequently, by agreement, 
  the parties submitted these issues to arbitration. The arbitration award was 
  incorporated into a judgment of Kiteley J. on July 22, 2002. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] The appellant is from a wealthy and well-known family. She made a motion 
  before Ferrier J. at the outset of the proceedings to seal the court file under 
  s. 137(2) of the Courts of Justice Act in an effort to ensure MT's safety and 
  security. This motion was not opposed by the respondent, and was granted by 
  Ferrier J. on an interim basis. <br>
</p>
<p>[4] The appellant's motion for a final order to seal the file was heard on 
  September 4, 2002 before Kiteley J., who also heard from intervenor counsel 
  for the appellant in the related but discrete action brought by the appellant 
  against her former nanny for breach of a confidentiality agreement. At this 
  point the respondent opposed the motion to seal the file. Kiteley J. denied 
  the request to seal the file. Instead, she expunged certain portions. Since 
  the order of Kiteley J., the action against the former nanny has been settled 
  on the basis that the confidentiality of MT will be permanently protected and 
  the action has been dismissed without costs.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Kiteley J. found that there was an appreciable risk of harm to the child 
  by kidnapping if the information respecting the child were left in the public 
  domain. She put it this way at page 9 of her reasons:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I see the responsibility of the court to ensure that 
  a court file which was created to protect the child's best interests does not 
  become the instrument to harm her. <br>
</p>
<p>[6] She was of the opinion, however, that if specific information was expunged, 
  the risk of harm would be eliminated while information that had no bearing on 
  the potential harm to the child would remain and preserve the social value of 
  openness. <br>
</p>
<p>[7] The appellant submits that the portions of the file remaining after the 
  information is expunged nevertheless continue to present a threat to the child's 
  well-being because, for example, the movements of the child will be known. The 
  appellant submits that, in order to eliminate the threat of kidnapping posed 
  by the court proceedings, it is necessary to seal the entire file. The evidence 
  of one of the experts whose affidavit was filed before Kiteley J. supports this 
  conclusion. <br>
</p>
<p>[8] The appellant intervenor submits that to the extent the record is not sealed 
  it undermines the settlement in that action. In that action the nanny agreed 
  that the confidential information be protected from being permanently disclosed 
  and the action was dismissed. The appellant intervenor submits that, although 
  this court is not bound by the settlement in the previous action, this is a 
  further factor for the court's consideration. <br>
</p>
<p>[9] The respondent submits that openness is necessary to protect the child's 
  right of access to her father. The respondent is concerned that the mechanism 
  to ensure accountability or enforcement of the order respecting access will 
  be impaired if the information is sealed. <br>
</p>
<p>[10] In our opinion, having regard to Kiteley J.'s finding of the risk of potential 
  harm to the child, the best interests of the child in this case require that 
  an exception be made to the general rule in favour of the openness of the court 
  under the authority of s. 137(2) of the Courts of Justice Act and that the entire 
  file be sealed.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] We do not agree with the respondent's submission that openness is necessary 
  to protect the child's access to her father. Nothing prevents the father from 
  coming back to the court, if necessary, to enforce the access agreement reached. 
  Any order of the court sealing information is subject to unsealing in whole 
  or in part in a later proceeding if that information bears on the relief being 
  sought. We stress that, contrary to the submission of the respondent, the sealing 
  order is not made because the child belongs to a wealthy family or because there 
  is a confidentiality agreement. Rather, the order is made because we consider 
  it to be in the best interests of the child. We expressly refrain from addressing 
  the issue on the basis of the confidentiality agreement or the action that was 
  brought to enforce it. <br>
</p>
<p>[12] We would therefore allow the appeal from the order of Kiteley J., set 
  aside her order and its place substitute an order that the entire file relating 
  to this proceeding be sealed. <br>
</p>
<p>[13] We are of the opinion that each of the parties should bear his or her 
  own costs of this appeal and of the proceeding before Kiteley J. </p>
