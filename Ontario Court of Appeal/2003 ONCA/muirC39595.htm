<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The parties to this appeal are neighbours who cannot agree on how to deal 
  with a shared well and water system. An application heard by Henderson J. resulted 
  in an order declaring that the appellants have an easement, by grant, for the 
  use of the well and water system located on the respondent&#8217;s property. 
  He further found that the appellants do not have an easement to repair, maintain, 
  upgrade or replace the well and water system.</p>
<p> [2] The appellants brought a motion before Abella J.A. to stay the order pending 
  hearing of the appeal. Abella J.A. dismissed the motion. </p>
<p> [3] The respondent moved to enter new evidence showing that after the issuance 
  of Abella J.A.&#8217;s order and before the hearing of the appeal, the appellants 
  installed alternate water systems or began the process of so doing. Further, 
  the respondent advised the appellants that she intended to shut off the communal 
  well and when the appellants did not request any additional time to complete 
  the installation of their alternate water systems, the respondent shut off the 
  communal well. </p>
<p> [4] The appellants acknowledge that the new evidence is credible and could 
  not have been obtained by reasonable diligence at the time of the original hearing 
  but argue against the motion on the basis that it is irrelevant to the adjudication 
  of the appeal.</p>
<p> [5] In our view, the new evidence should be admitted since it bears on the 
  central issue in the case, the nature and scope of the easement.</p>
<p> [6] Dealing first with the cross-appeal, we are satisfied that there was sufficient 
  evidence before the applications judge to support his finding of an easement 
  by express grant. There was also sufficient evidence that the respondent had 
  notice of the easement. Accordingly, the cross-appeal must be dismissed.</p>
<p> [7] As to the appeal, the appellants&#8217; principal ground of appeal was 
  that the applications judge erred in holding that where an easement is created 
  by grant &#8220;except in extraordinary circumstances&#8221;, the property rights 
  are determined by the &#8220;precise language of the grant&#8221;. </p>
<p> [8] It may well be that the applications judge did err in applying that test 
  to the determination of the scope of the easement. As held by this court in 
  Mackenzie v. Matthews, the grant of an easement includes a grant of ancillary 
  rights that are reasonably necessary to the use and enjoyment of the easement 
  and which were contemplated by the grantor. The difficulty for the appellants 
  in this case relates to the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence. As was stated 
  in Mackenzie v. Matthews, there is no mechanical way to determine what constitutes 
  an unreasonable demand upon an easement. Each case depends not only upon a proper 
  construction of the instrument creating the easement but also the factual circumstances 
  including the purpose of the easement, the circumstances of its creation, the 
  history of its development and the circumstances of its use, when determining 
  what ancillary rights were contemplated by the grantor.</p>
<p> [9] Further, the only evidence as to the state of the well that was before 
  the applications judge, and which he appears to have accepted, is that the well 
  could not be repaired, the well was a potential source of contamination to adjacent 
  wells and the only solution was to abandon and decommission the well. The fresh 
  evidence establishes that the well has, in fact, now been decommissioned. The 
  respondent also points out that she was subject to penal liability because of 
  the contamination of the water and that the appellants continued to use the 
  water despite knowing it was unsafe but refused to release the respondent from 
  liability.</p>
<p> [10] In light of the evidence at trial and the fresh evidence, the appellants 
  can only succeed by showing that actual replacement of the well was contemplated 
  by the original grant. In our view, the appellants did not adduce sufficient 
  evidence to demonstrate that this was contemplated by the original grant. What 
  evidence there is seems to point in the other direction, i.e. that what was 
  contemplated was use and repair of the original well. Thus, by the time this 
  dispute arose, the majority of owners were no longer using the so-called communal 
  well and the fresh evidence shows that the rest of the owners have now drilled 
  their own wells. </p>
<p> Disposition </p>
<p> [11] Accordingly, the appeal and cross-appeal are dismissed without costs. 
  There shall be no order as to costs of the motion to receive further evidence. 
  The respondent is entitled to costs of the motion to stay fixed in the amount 
  of $2,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
