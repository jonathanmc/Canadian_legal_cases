<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] While we are of the view that the appellant's statement to the arresting 
  officer had practically no probative value, we cannot see how its admission 
  caused any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. It was, at its highest, 
  an equivocal and ambiguous observation which could not have influenced the jury 
  in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>[2] Nor do we agree with the remaining submissions. The trial judge did not 
  err in excluding the evidence of the police officer's opinion about the appellant's 
  statement to him. The officer's opinion was a mixed one, and the trial judge 
  did not err in exercising his discretion to exclude it, given its potentially 
  prejudicial impact on the accused.</p>
<p>[3] Finally, despite his able submissions, we do not agree with Mr. Breen that 
  the trial judge improperly restricted the defence's cross-examination in connection 
  with the complainant's statement of claim. As for the Seaboyer argument, the 
  proposed cross-examination was of such dubious probative value, that we see 
  no basis for interfering with the trial judge's discretion to restrict it.</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
