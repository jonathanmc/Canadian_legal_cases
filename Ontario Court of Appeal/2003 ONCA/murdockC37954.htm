<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice B.C. Hawkins of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated October 16, 2001 and the sentence imposed on October 
  30, 2001.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [1] Section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 
  (the &quot;Act&quot;) makes it a crime to traffic in a narcotic. Traffic is 
  broadly defined in s. 2 of the Act to include offering to sell or give a narcotic 
  to another. As interpreted by various appellate courts, the offence of trafficking 
  by offer is made out if an offer to traffic in a narcotic is made regardless 
  of whether the accused actually intends to sell or give the narcotic offered.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant submits that as presently interpreted, the offence of trafficking 
  by offer falls short of the minimum substantive requirements imposed on crime 
  creating statutes by s. 7 of the Charter. He contends that the offence will 
  pass constitutional muster only if it is interpreted as requiring an intention 
  to actually sell or give the narcotic offered. If this interpretation prevails, 
  the appeal must be allowed and the appellant acquitted. </p>
<p> [3] I would dismiss the appeal.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> The crime of trafficking 
  by offer as presently defined does not infringe s. 7 of the Charter.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>
  [4] The facts giving rise to this appeal can be stated briefly. An undercover 
  police officer testified that the appellant offered to sell him crack cocaine 
  and later withdrew that offer. The appellant did not have any drugs in his possession 
  when he was arrested several minutes later.</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant testified that he knew from the outset that he was dealing 
  with an undercover police officer. According to the appellant, the officer made 
  several requests to purchase drugs. The appellant testified that he never offered 
  to sell drugs to the officer.</p>
<p>
  [6] The trial judge convicted the appellant. In his reasons, he said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; It is submitted on behalf of the accused that there was, as his counsel 
  puts it, no legitimate offer to sell. In my view, there is no legal validity 
  to that argument. The essence of the offence is an intention to make an offer, 
  it is irrelevant whether the person intends to carry out that offer, or whether 
  he is capable or incapable of carrying it out. As I say, the offence is complete 
  when the officer is made [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  Trafficking by Offer: The Present Interpretation </p>
<p>
  [7] Section 5(1) of the Act provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  No person shall traffic in a substance included in Schedule I, II, III, or IV 
  or in any substance represented or held out by that person to be such a substance. 
</p>
<p>
  [8] The definition of the word &quot;traffic&quot; as set out in s. 2 of the 
  Act includes the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or 
  deliver the substance</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a)</p>
<p>
  [9] Provincial appellate courts have repeatedly held that where an accused is 
  charged with trafficking by offer, the Crown is not required to prove that the 
  accused actually intended to go through with the offer and sell or otherwise 
  provide the offered narcotic: R. v. Petrie, [1947] O.W.N. 601 at 603 (C.A.); 
  R. v. Sherman (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 207 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. 
  refused 17 N.R. 178n; R. v. Mamchur, [1978] 4 W.W.R. 481 (Sask. C.A.); R. v. 
  Mancuso (1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Que. C.A.), leave to appeal to SCC refused 
  (1990) 58 C.C.C. (3d) vi; R. v. Reid (1996), 155 N.S.R. (2d) 368 at 370 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [10] In Sherman, supra, at p. 208, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Now, in my reading of the cases an offer to sell or deliver a narcotic is complete 
  once the offer is put forward by the accused in a serious manner intending to 
  induce officer White [the undercover officer] to act upon it and to accept it 
  as an offer. &#133; [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [11] MacFarlane J.A. agreed with the trial judge and added at p. 208: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I accept the argument made by counsel for the Crown that the actus reus in this 
  case is the making of an offer. There can be no doubt that the appellant intended 
  to make an offer to sell or deliver heroin and that provides in my opinion, 
  the mens rea necessary to prove the offence.</p>
<p>
  [12] In Mancuso, supra, at pp. 389-90, the Quebec Court of Appeal approved of 
  a jury instruction in these terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [I]f I offer to you to provide you, to sell you cocaine, whether or not the 
  transaction goes through I made the offer, therefore I have trafficked in cocaine. 
  The offence was complete with my offer and I gave you reason to believe that 
  I was serious in that offer to provide you with cocaine. I trafficked by making 
  that offer, &#133; [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [13] The appellate authorities referred to above were cited with approval in 
  R. v. Shirose, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 565. In Shirose, the lawfulness of a &quot;reverse 
  sting&quot; operation conducted by undercover police officers was in issue. 
  During that operation, the undercover officers had offered to sell narcotics 
  to the accused. The officers did not intend to go through with the sale, but 
  intended to arrest the accused when they attended to make the purchase. Binnie 
  J. observed at para. 25: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The conclusion that the RCMP acted in a manner facially prohibited by the Act 
  is inescapable &#133; The actus reus of the offence of trafficking is the making 
  of an offer, and when accompanied by intent to do so, the necessary mens rea 
  is made out: see R. v. Mancuso (1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Que. C.A.) at p. 
  390, leave to appeal refused, [1990] 2 S.C.R. viii, 58 C.C.C. (3d) vi. There 
  is no need to prove both the intent to make the offer to sell and the intent 
  to carry out the offer: see R. v. Mamchur, [1978] 4 W.W.R. 481 (Sask. C.A.). 
  See also, e.g., R. v. Sherman (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 207 (B.C.C.A.) at p. 208, 
  upholding a conviction where there was evidence that the accused had offered 
  to sell heroin to a person he knew was an undercover police officer, with a 
  view to &quot;rip off&quot; the officer and not complete the sale. Sherman was 
  later followed on this point in Mancuso, supra, at pp. 389-90, where the accused 
  argued unsuccessfully that he did not intend actually to sell narcotics to a 
  police informer, but really wished to steal his money [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [14] On these authorities, the offence of trafficking by offer is made out 
  if the accused: </p>
<ul>
  <li>offers to traffic in a narcotic [the actus reus]; and </li>
  <li>intends to make an offer that will be taken as a genuine offer by the recipient 
    [the mens rea]. <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Constitutional Challenge</p>
<p>
  [15] The constitutionality of the offence of trafficking by offer was not before 
  the court in Shirose, supra. This court, however, in a brief endorsement in 
  1990 upheld the constitutionality of the offence and specifically rejected one 
  of the two arguments made on behalf of the appellant: R. v. Manion, [1990] O.J. 
  No. 716 (C.A.). It may be that this appeal should be dismissed simply on the 
  basis of the binding authority in Manion. I will, however, examine the merits 
  of the appellant's constitutional argument. </p>
<p>
  [16] The appellant relies on s. 7 of the Charter: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right 
  not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental 
  justice.</p>
<p>
  [17] Section 7 recognizes the right not to be deprived of one's liberty except 
  in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. Trafficking by offer 
  is punishable by life imprisonment. The appellant's liberty interest protected 
  by s. 7 of the Charter was clearly engaged when he was charged. </p>
<p>
  [18] Statutes that create crimes are subject to substantive review under s. 
  7 of the Charter: See Reference re s. 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 
  2 S.C.R. 486 at 513; Rodriguez v. British Columbia (A.G.), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519 
  at 589. Mr. Harris, for the appellant, relies on two principles of fundamental 
  justice. He submits that if an accused does not actually intend to traffic in 
  a narcotic, the imposition of criminal liability rests on findings that do not 
  comport with the minimum fault requirement demanded by s. 7. In making this 
  submission, Mr. Harris relies on the seriousness of the crime of trafficking 
  as reflected by the maximum penalty of life imprisonment and the stigma attached 
  to those who are convicted of dealing in drugs. Mr. Harris also submits that 
  an accused who makes an offer to traffic without actually intending to traffic 
  in a narcotic is engaged in conduct which is not sufficiently harmful to constitutionally 
  justify the criminalization of that conduct. </p>
<p>
  [19] Mr. Harris points out, quite accurately, that if either submission is accepted, 
  there is no need to declare any part of the Act inoperative. It is only necessary 
  to re-interpret s. 5(1) of the Act so as to require that the Crown proves an 
  actual intention to traffic in the narcotic. </p>
<p>
  [20] The first of these two submissions failed in Manion, supra, but I will 
  reconsider the argument in the light of case law which postdates Manion. </p>
<p>
  [21] It is well established that it is a principle of fundamental justice that 
  a person cannot be convicted of a true crime without a finding of personal fault: 
  R. v. DeSousa, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944 at 956. Trafficking by offer is a true crime. 
  Fault may be objectively or subjectively based: R. v. Creighton, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 
  3; D. Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law: A Treatise, 4th ed. (Scarborough, ON: Carswell, 
  2001). Some crimes, because of the stigma attached to their commission demand 
  subjectively based fault: R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636. </p>
<p>
  [22] Mr. Harris submits that there is no fault component to the offence of trafficking 
  by offer as presently defined. Relying on R. v. Guggenmoos (1986), 27 C.R.R. 
  55 at 57 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), he contends that the offence as defined is one of 
  absolute liability, since guilt follows upon proof of the prohibited conduct. 
</p>
<p>
  [23] This submission ignores the requirement that the Crown must prove an intention 
  to make an offer. The words or actions which constitute the offer do not, standing 
  alone, prove the crime. I agree with Mr. Frater, counsel for the Crown, that 
  the words of an offer spoken in jest would not attract criminal liability as 
  the Crown would have failed to prove an intention to make an offer to traffic 
  in narcotics. The Crown must show that the alleged maker of the offer intended 
  that the offer would be taken as a true and genuine offer to traffic in narcotics.</p>
<p>
  [24] Trafficking by offer is what is referred to as a conduct offence in that 
  the crime as defined by Parliament does not require that any consequence flow 
  from the prohibited conduct. The fault component of conduct crimes attaches 
  to the prohibited conduct, which in this case is the making of the offer to 
  traffic in a narcotic. The offence as presently defined requires that the Crown 
  prove an actual intention to do the prohibited conduct. The fault requirement 
  is subjective and is consistent with the standard of blameworthiness usually 
  associated with true crimes: R. v. Sault Ste. Marie (City), [1978] 2 S.C.R. 
  1299 at 1309. </p>
<p>
  [25] The case law subsequent to Manion, supra, confirms the correctness of that 
  decision. As is presently interpreted, the fault requirement in the crime of 
  trafficking by offer meets the requirements of s. 7 of the Charter. </p>
<p>
  [26] The appellant's second submission rests on the assertion that it is a principle 
  of fundamental justice that conduct can only be criminalized if it meets a minimum 
  level of harm. The appellant submits that as the criminal sanction represents 
  the state's ultimate weapon against the individual, it can be unsheathed only 
  where the conduct in issue poses a sufficient danger to the safety of others 
  in the community. Put in the language of s. 7, the appellant contends that the 
  imposition of a criminal sanction for conduct which is not harmful results in 
  an interference with an individual's right to liberty that is not in accordance 
  with the principles of fundamental justice.</p>
<p>
  [27] I am spared much of the intellectual heavy lifting involved in a consideration 
  of this submission. Braidwood J.A. in a well reasoned analysis in R. v. Malmo-Levine 
  (2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at 246-82 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. 
  granted [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 490, accepted that the &quot;harm principle&quot; 
  was a principle of fundamental justice. He framed the principle in these words 
  at p. 275: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The proper way of characterizing the &quot;harm principle&quot; in the context 
  of the Charter is to determine whether the prohibited activities hold a &quot;reasoned 
  apprehension of harm&quot; to other individuals or society: &#133; the degree 
  of harm must be neither insignificant nor trivial.</p>
<p>
  [28] In R. v. Clay (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 276 at 289-90 (Ont. C.A.), leave 
  to Supreme Court of Canada granted [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 492, Rosenberg J.A. accepted 
  &quot;for the purposes of the appeal&quot; that the harm principle as articulated 
  by Braidwood J.A. in R. v. Malmo-Levine, supra, was a principle of fundamental 
  justice. </p>
<p>
  [29] I find the analysis provided by Braidwood J.A. in Malmo-Levine, supra, 
  persuasive. In addition to the sources he refers to in support of his conclusion 
  that the harm principle is a principle of fundamental justice, I would add that 
  the concept has strong common law roots. The &quot;de minimis&quot; defence 
  at common law operated to prevent the conviction of those whose conduct, while 
  falling within the four corners of the penal provision, were so trivial as to 
  pose no risk to the public interest: Stuart, supra, at pp. 594-98. The harm 
  principle also underlies the long accepted rule of statutory interpretation 
  which directs that criminal statues, where possible, should not be read so as 
  to encompass conduct which is trivial or harmless: R. v. Hinchey, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 
  1128 at para. 36; Ontario v. Canadian Pacific Ltd., [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1031 at 
  1082.</p>
<p>
  [30] The harm principle fits comfortably among those principles of fundamental 
  justice that are engaged by a substantive review of criminal legislation. Like 
  the fault principle, (DeSousa, supra) and the voluntariness principle, (R. v. 
  Daviault, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 63 at 102-103), the harm principle precludes the conviction 
  of those &quot;who have not really done anything wrong&quot; Reference re s. 
  94(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, supra, at p. 293. The criminalization of harmless 
  conduct like the criminalization of blameless or involuntary conduct violates 
  individual autonomy by imposing the sanction and stigma of the criminal law 
  process on individuals absent any legitimate state interest justifying interference 
  with the individual's autonomy.</p>
<p>
  [31] Although I accept that the harm principle is a principle of fundamental 
  justice, like my colleague Rosenberg J.A. in Clay, supra, at p. 289, I recognize 
  that the concept of harm as employed in the criminal law can be a nebulous and 
  unruly standard. The harm principle, like other principles of fundamental justice, 
  does not give the judiciary licence to review the wisdom of legislation: Creighton, 
  supra, at p. 378; Rodriguez v. British Columbia (A.G.), supra, at p. 65. Nor 
  should the harm principle be taken as an invitation to the judiciary to consecrate 
  a particular theory of criminal liability as a principle of fundamental justice. 
  This is so even if that theory has gained the support of law reformers, some 
  of whom also happen to be judges. Judicial review of the substantive content 
  of criminal legislation under s. 7 should not be confused with law reform. Judicial 
  review tests the validity of legislation against the minimum standards set out 
  in the Charter. Law reform tests the legal status quo against the law reformer's 
  opinion of what the law should be. </p>
<p> [32] The nature and degree of harm said to justify resort to the criminal 
  sanction is a matter of debate among philosophers and criminal law theorists. 
  To some, harmful conduct has a broad meaning encompassing any conduct which 
  threatens or harms any legitimate individual or societal interest: Canada, Department 
  of Justice, The Criminal Law in Canadian Society (Ottawa: Government of Canada, 
  1982) at p. 45. Others prefer a more restricted notion of harm. Some reject 
  self-harm as a basis for the imposition of criminal liability because it is 
  unduly paternalistic. Still others reject public morality<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> 
  as an appropriate basis upon which to impose the criminal sanction: A. Ashworth, 
  Principles of Criminal Law 2d ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1985, chap. 2); J.P. 
  McCutcheon, &quot;Morality in the Criminal Law: Reflections on Hart-Devlin&quot; 
  (2002) 47 Crim. L.Q., at p. 15. </p>
<p> [33] It is not for the judiciary under the guise of applying the harm principle 
  as a principle of fundamental justice to choose from among the competing theories 
  of harm advanced by criminal law theorists. The harm principle, as a principle 
  of fundamental justice, goes only so far as to preclude the criminalization 
  of conduct for which there is no &quot;reasoned apprehension of harm&quot; to 
  any legitimate personal or societal interest. If conduct clears that threshold, 
  it cannot be said that criminalization of such conduct raises the spectre of 
  convicting someone who has not done anything wrong. Difficult questions such 
  as whether the harm justifies the imposition of a criminal prohibition or whether 
  the criminal law is the best way to address the harm are policy questions that 
  are beyond the constitutional competence of the judiciary and the institutional 
  competence of the criminal law adversarial process. <a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a></p>
<p>
  [34] The distinction I have attempted to draw between the harm principle as 
  a principle of fundamental justice and closely related, but distinct policy 
  questions surrounding the application of the criminal law leads me to the one 
  difference between my analysis and that provided by Braidwood J.A. in Malmo-Levine, 
  supra, and adopted &quot;for the purposes of the appeal&quot; by Rosenberg J.A. 
  in Clay, supra. In his analysis, Braidwood J.A. identified the harm principle 
  as a principle of fundamental justice and defined that principle (pp. 262-75). 
  He then considered whether the prohibition against possession of a narcotic 
  conformed with the harm principle as he had defined. He concluded that it did 
  (pp. 275-77, 281). Braidwood J.A. next proceeded to a consideration of whether 
  the impugned legislation struck a proper balance between the individual and 
  the state (p. 277). In this part of the analysis he considered many factors 
  such as the deleterious effects flowing from the criminal prohibition both as 
  applied to the individual subject of the prohibition and society at large.</p>
<p>
  [35] With respect, having concluded that the relevant statutory provisions accorded 
  with the harm principle, I do not agree that a further consideration of whether 
  the provisions struck &quot;the right balance&quot; was mandated by the harm 
  principle as a principle of fundamental justice. In my view, the harm principle 
  as described by Braidwood J.A. (Malmo-Levine, supra, at p. 275) itself reflects 
  the balancing of societal and individual interests required by s. 7. The state 
  interest is the protection of individuals in the community from the harm occasioned 
  by the conduct in issue. The individual interest is the right to be left alone 
  by the state. The harm principle, as described by Braidwood J.A., balances those 
  competing interests by directing that the state can interfere with individual 
  autonomy by way of a criminal prohibition only where there is a reasoned apprehension 
  of harm occasioned by the conduct of the individual. To engage in a further 
  balancing process based on harm related concerns, after it is determined that 
  the impugned legislation complies with the harm principle, leads inevitably 
  to a review of policy choices and goes beyond protecting those who have done 
  nothing wrong from the criminal sanction. For example, I do not think that considerations 
  of the overall harm caused to the due administration of justice by the criminalization 
  of conduct has anything to do with whether criminalization of that conduct offends 
  the harm principle. The effect of criminalization on the overall administration 
  of justice is an important question, but it is a policy question which is not 
  germane to the judicial review contemplated by s. 7 of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  [36] In holding that the harm principle as a principle of fundamental justice 
  contemplates only a determination of whether the prohibited conduct presents 
  a reasoned apprehension of harm, I do not suggest that the substantive review 
  of crime creating statutes is limited to that narrow question. The harm principle 
  is but one of several related principles of fundamental justice that are engaged 
  on a substantive review of criminal legislation. Principles of fault, overbreadth, 
  vagueness, and gross proportionality between the harm caused and the punishment 
  imposed are among the principles of fundamental justice that are germane to 
  a substantive review of criminal legislation under s. 7: see R. v. Smith, [1987] 
  1 S.C.R. 1045; R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society (No. 2), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 
  606; R. v. Heywood, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 761. In addition, other specific provisions 
  of the Charter impose constitutional limits on the availability of the criminal 
  law sanction: see R. v. Zundel, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 731.</p>
<p>
  [37] The harm caused by the crime of trafficking by offer was not canvassed 
  at trial. In support of his contention that the conduct prohibited by that offence 
  poses no real harm to society, Mr. Harris analogizes the offence to the law 
  of attempt. He submits that trafficking by offer is a form of attempt in that 
  it is preparatory to the offence of actually trafficking in a narcotic. Mr. 
  Harris correctly observes that attempts to commit an offence require proof of 
  an actual intention to complete that offence: Criminal Code s. 24(1). </p>
<p>
  [38] I do not find the attempt analogy helpful. No doubt, in many cases, an 
  offer to traffic is preparatory to an actual act of trafficking, however, the 
  offence of trafficking by offer as defined by Parliament is a substantive and 
  not an inchoate offence. I know of no constitutional principle that precludes 
  Parliament from defining conduct as a substantive crime, even though that very 
  conduct may be preparatory to the commission of a further crime. The Criminal 
  Code is replete with this kind of offence: See e.g. Criminal Code s. 119(1)(b); 
  s. 120(b); s. 121(1)(a)(i); s. 143(c); s. 353(1)(a); s. 369(b).</p>
<p>
  [39] The harm to society, occasioned by the drug trade cannot be gainsayed. 
  The appellant does not suggest that drug trafficking is not harmful in the relevant 
  sense, but rather contends that his conduct is sufficiently removed from actual 
  drug trafficking so as not to constitute the harm associated with the drug trade. 
  I disagree. </p>
<p>
  [40] Offers to traffic in narcotics even when there is no intention to traffic, 
  induce recipients of the offers to participate in drug trafficking and thereby 
  promote and expand the illicit drug trade. It is also entirely reasonable to 
  conclude that those who are prepared to make serious offers to traffic in narcotics 
  will, if the opportunity presents itself, complete the transaction. Furthermore, 
  offers to traffic in narcotics, even if there is no intention to actually carry 
  through with the offer, raise the same risks of collateral criminal activity 
  that &quot;true&quot; offers to traffic precipitate. Finally, the criminalization 
  of trafficking by offer can reasonably be viewed as aimed at the very harm occasioned 
  by the actual trafficking in narcotics. By criminalizing conduct which in many 
  occasions will be preparatory to actual trafficking in narcotics, Parliament 
  may reduce the incidence of actual trafficking and the harm caused by it. </p>
<p>
  [41] For the reasons set out above, I am satisfied that offers to traffic intended 
  to be received as genuine offers cause a reasoned apprehension of significant 
  harm to other individuals and to society such that criminalization of that conduct 
  is not inconsistent with the fundamental principles of justice.</p>
<p>
  [42] I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>RELEASED: &quot;MAC&quot; &quot;JUN 23 2003&quot;</p>

<P><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> The appellant also alleged that the trial 
  judge reversed the burden of proof and that the Crown&#146;s cross-examination 
  on his criminal record resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The court did not 
  call on the respondent on either submission. In my view, neither has any merit 
  and I do not propose to address them in these reasons.</p>
<P><a name="2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a> Section 4(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 
  1971 (U.K.) which prohibits offers to supply controlled drugs has been interpreted 
  in the same way: R. v. Goodard, [1992] Crim. L.R. 588 (C.A. Crim. Div.).</p>
<P><a name="3"></a><a href="#r3">[3]</a> The contention that R. v. Butler, [1992] 
  1 S.C.R. 452 forecloses reliance on morality as justification for the imposition 
  of the criminal sanction is wrong. In fact, the opposite is true. Sopinka J. 
  said at p. 156: &#147;On the other hand, I do not agree with the suggestion 
  of the appellant that Parliament does not have the right to legislate on the 
  basis of some fundamental conception of morality for the purpose of safeguarding 
  values that are integral to a free and democratic society.&#148; Sopinka J. 
  clearly distinguishes between morality in the sense of conventional notions 
  of acceptable conduct and morality in the sense of bedrock principles that reflect 
  society&#146;s shared values.</p>
<P><a name="4"></a><a href="#r4">[4]</a> For example, many argue that the criminal 
  sanction should be a last resort employed only if other forms of governmental 
  action cannot adequately address the harm flowing from the conduct. This minimalist 
  approach to criminal law may well be sound criminal law policy. However, it 
  hardly reflects the historical reality of the scope of the criminal law so as 
  to be properly described as a principle of fundamental justice. Any attempt 
  to apply minimalist doctrine to a specific piece of legislation would raise 
  complex questions of social policy which would defy effective resolution in 
  the context of the adversarial criminal law process. </p>
