<p>On appeal from the order of Justice A. Gans of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated November 26, 2001, allowing in part an appeal from the decision of Justice 
  R. Shamai of the Ontario Court of Justice dated April 25, 2000.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The respondents were convicted by Her Honour Justice R. Shamai on April 
  25, 2000 of various offences under the Liquor Licence Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.19. 
  In the course of the proceedings before Shamai J., the respondents brought two 
  applications to have the proceedings stayed as an abuse of process on account 
  of alleged Crown bias. Shamai J. dismissed both applications and convicted the 
  respondents as charged.</p>
<p>[2] Following their convictions, the respondents appealed to the Superior Court 
  of Justice seeking, among other things, a reversal of Shamai J.&#146;s rulings 
  on the stay applications. Gans J. allowed the appeal in part. He found that 
  there was a loss of independence and objectivity on the part of the prosecution 
  during the course of the proceedings and although he did not say so expressly, 
  he concluded that this loss of neutrality rendered the prosecution abusive.</p>
<p>[3] With respect to remedy, Gans J. was not satisfied that this was one of 
  the clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings. He did, however, order 
  that the Attorney General pay $25,000 towards the respondents&#146; costs. In 
  Gans J.&#146;s opinion, such an award &#147;would go a long way in insuring 
  that retainers of outside counsel are not undertaken by Crown corporations in 
  future without the requisite supervision of the Office of the Attorney General.&#148; 
</p>
<p>[4] The Crown appeals from the order of Gans J. and seeks to have it overturned. 
  The respondents cross-appeal and seek to have the remedy ordered by Gans J. 
  varied from an award of costs to a stay of proceedings.</p>
<p>[5] For the brief reasons that follow, we are of the view that the appeal should 
  be allowed, and the order of Gans J. set aside.</p>
<p>[6] The stay applications brought by the respondents centred primarily on the 
  retention of Mr. Gover (a member of the Ontario bar in private practice) &#147;to 
  advise on and represent the Crown&#148; in connection with an ongoing investigation 
  into the illegal sale of liquor in Ontario by the respondents and others. In 
  particular, the respondents alleged that Mr. Gover&#146;s ability to conduct 
  a prosecution fairly and independently was compromised by the fact that his 
  legal fees were being paid for by the Liquor Control Board and he was being 
  supervised by Ms. Fitzpatrick in her capacity as a full time officer and employee 
  of the Board. With respect to the latter concern, the respondents pointed to 
  the fact that after retaining Mr. Gover in her capacity &#147;as agent acting 
  on behalf of the Attorney General,&#148; Ms. Fitzpatrick left her position of 
  employment with the Attorney General and took up full time employment with the 
  Liquor Control Board. Thereafter, the respondents allege that Mr. Gover was 
  effectively taking his instructions from and retained by the Board, as opposed 
  to the Attorney General. As indicated, Shamai J. found those allegations to 
  be unfounded. We agree.</p>
<p>[7] Having been retained by the Attorney General to represent the Crown in 
  connection with the investigation and possible prosecution of the respondents 
  and others for illegal liquor sales, Mr. Gover was required, as Crown Counsel, 
  to conduct himself with objectivity and fairness. His commitment to do so is 
  found in the retainer agreement of January 15, 1998 in which Mr. Gover agreed, 
  among other things, to &#147;be governed by any direction&#148; he might &#147;receive 
  from the acting Assistant Deputy Attorney General or his designate&#148; and 
  to &#147;comply with the Practice and Procedures mandated by the Ontario Crown 
  Policy Manual.&#148; As Gans J. observed in his reasons, the preamble to that 
  manual provides that:</p>
<p class="indent">Crown counsel play a pivotal role in the criminal justice 
  system. Only Crown counsel empowered to fully and independently exercise their 
  discretion can bring about a fair trial of those accused of an offence and the 
  protection of the many interests of the public.</p>
<p>[8] In her reasons of November 19, 1998 dismissing the respondents&#146; application 
  for a stay, Shamai J. found that there was no basis to infer, let alone conclude, 
  that Mr. Gover had acted other than in accordance with the terms and conditions 
  of his retainer. In coming to that conclusion, Shamai J. was fully aware of 
  Ms. Fitzpatrick&#146;s altered job status as of August 1998. In that regard, 
  she made the following observation in her reasons:</p>
<p class="indent">The plain language of the letter of retainer covers 
  the necessaries of delegation in virtually the language of the relevant jurisprudence. 
  It covers the eventuality that the law officer of the Crown may not continue 
  to be instructing counsel, and it carefully adverts to the dual aspects of [the] 
  retainer &#133;[emphasis added].</p>
<p>Shamai J. then went on to find that there was &#147;no foundation&#148; to 
  the suggestion that Mr. Gover had acted in contravention of the terms of his 
  retainer.</p>
<p>[9] Shamai J.&#146;s opinion remained the same on the renewed application for 
  a stay of proceedings brought by the respondents on December 6, 1999. In her 
  reasons dated March 20, 2000, Shamai J. found that &#147;none of the circumstances 
  which have been offered as fresh evidence amount to admissible evidence which 
  is, in any way, of probative value or even persuasive with respect to the issues 
  set out as the basis of the application here.&#148;</p>
<p>[10] On appeal, Gans J. took a different view of the matter. At para. 16 of 
  his reasons, he explained the reasoning process that led him to conclude that 
  Shamai J. had erred: </p>
<p class="indent">&#133; In the first place, I have analyzed the duties, 
  role and obligations of Crown attorneys, generally. I then reviewed the particular 
  retainer to determine whether there was any conflict between theory and reality 
  and if so, to what extent. As a result of this approach, my conclusion on certain 
  of the issues under appeal differs from that of the learned trial judge.</p>
<p>[11] Gans J. then commenced his analysis by observing, correctly, that Crown 
  counsel serve in a quasi-judicial capacity and that when instituting or staying 
  proceedings, they are to demonstrate &#147;independence and arrive at any such 
  decisions objectively, impartially and in an even-handed manner&#148;. He then 
  continued as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">The relationship between Ms. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Gover 
  lost the mantle of the Attorney General and the objectivity attendant thereto 
  when she resigned her posting with that office. In the fall of 1998 and thereafter, 
  their relationship can only be construed as a classical solicitor-client relationship 
  where the client (the Board) would have the ultimate decision-making responsibility, 
  which responsibility, by definition, would include the right to continue or 
  stay proceedings. In my view, the term contained in the retainer letter which 
  &#147;required&#148; Mr. Gover to follow the directive of the Acting Deputy 
  Attorney General or his designate was mere window dressing. From a practical 
  point of view, it was of little or no effect. </p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Because Ms. Fitzpatrick was no longer an officer of 
  the Attorney General, it was safe to conclude that Mr. Gover was arguably no 
  longer acting like other &#147;rent-a-Crowns&#148; who are hired to prosecute 
  cases on an ad hoc basis. He was then in a position of receiving instructions 
  from one who is no longer bound by the independence and impartiality of the 
  Crown law office. The indifference between winning and losing was no longer 
  a guiding principle. Winning was, presumably, of paramount importance.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; In my respectful summation, absent any evidence 
  to the contrary, Justice Shamai erred in concluding that Mr. Gover was still 
  subject to supervision from the office of the Attorney General, in the person 
  of Mr. Segal or his designate.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, I believe this court could and should conclude 
  that there was, therefore, more than the mere suggestion of overlap between 
  the investigator-client and Crown counsel. This relationship would lead to the 
  unalterable conclusion that the objectivity of Crown counsel would or could 
  be lost.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Having concluded that the principles of independence 
  and objectivity were or may not have been met by the form of retainer, I must 
  now determine what remedy, if any, should be fashioned as a result.</p>
<p>[12] With respect, we are of the view that the concerns raised by Gans J. are 
  speculative and without evidentiary foundation. There is no basis on this record 
  for inferring, let alone concluding, that Mr. Gover did not comply with his 
  obligations as Crown counsel in accordance with the terms of his retainer. That 
  observation holds true both during Ms. Fitzpatrick&#146;s tenure with the office 
  of the Attorney General (when she hired Mr. Gover on behalf of the Attorney 
  General) and thereafter, when she left that position and assumed full time employment 
  with the Liquor Control Board.</p>
<p>[13] As indicated, the retainer entered into by Mr. Gover contained a term 
  requiring that he be governed by any direction received from the Acting Assistant 
  Deputy Attorney General or his designate and that he comply with the Practices 
  and Procedures mandated by the Ontario Crown Policy Manual. In her role as trier 
  of fact, Shamai J. found that Mr. Gover complied throughout with the terms and 
  conditions of his retainer. That finding was available to her and in our respectful 
  view, there was no basis for interfering with it on appeal.</p>
<p>[14] Accordingly, we would allow the appeal and set aside Gans J.&#146;s order. 
</p>
<p>The Cross-appeal is dismissed.</p>
