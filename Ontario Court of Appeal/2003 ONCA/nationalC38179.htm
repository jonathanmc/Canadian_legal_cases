<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Donald S. Cooper of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice dated March 14, 2002.</p>  <p>
  WEILER J.A.:</p>  <p>
  [1] The issue on this appeal is whether it is appropriate to grant a judicial 
  stay of proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process where there has been 
  a delay in laying charges following an investigation under the Occupational 
  Health and Safety Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 321.</p>  <p>
  The Facts</p>  <p>
  [2] Workers at National Steel Car (the Company) raised concerns that they were 
  working in proximity to damaged insulation that contained asbestos. The Company 
  arranged for samples of the insulation to be tested. Although the test results 
  confirmed the workers' concerns, the workers were not informed of the results 
  of the test until approximately one week later. The workers then staged a work 
  refusal and the Ministry of Labour was called to investigate allegations of 
  infractions under the Occupational Health and Safety Act between December 15, 
  1999 and April 12, 2000. The trial judge found that the investigation of the 
  complaint was completed for the most part on April 20th, 2000. The investigator 
  submitted his report to the legal department of the Ministry of Labour on or 
  about November 6, 2000 and on February 28, 2001 charges were laid against the 
  company. </p>

<p>
  [3] In calculating the length of the delay for purposes of considering the stay 
  application, the justice of the peace included the pre charge delay and the 
  anticipatory delay from the date of the application in to the date of trial. 
  She stated:</p>  
<p class="indent"> &#133;.considering both the pre and post-charge delay, 
  it is anticipated that the time from the commission of the alleged offence to 
  the date of trial will be at least 20 months. </p>  
<p>
  [4] Notwithstanding the fact that she found this delay unreasonable, she ruled 
  that the s.11 (b) application failed as the Company had not established that 
  it suffered irremediable prejudice. </p>  <p>
  [5] The justice of the peace then considered whether there had been an abuse 
  of process in light of unexplained pre-charge delay that was not &quot;attributed 
  to discovery and investigation&quot;. Her Worship held that the onus shifted 
  to the Crown to explain or justify the pre-charge delay.</p>  
<p class="indent"> The Occupational Health and Safety Act states that 
  no prosecution shall be instituted more than one year after the last act or 
  default upon which the prosecution is based occurred. This is to allow for the 
  discovery of and investigation into offences against the Act. The time is not 
  to be used as a convenience, or accommodation, or in any way as an advantage 
  to the Crown. Therefore, when the offence has been identified and investigated, 
  and charges are going to be laid, it should be done as expeditiously as possible 
  so as not to impact on the accused's ability to make full answer and defence. 
  So when there is a delay that cannot be attributed to the discovery and investigation, 
  the Crown has an obligation to explain that delay.</p>  
<p>
  [6] In the absence of any explanation from the Crown for the pre-charge delay, 
  she held that there had been an abuse of process that warranted the imposition 
  of a stay.</p>  <p>
  [7] Cooper J. dismissed the Crown's appeal stating the justice of the peace 
  had, &quot;made the right decision for the right reasons and did not err in 
  law or fact &#133;&quot;</p>  <p>
  [8] Notwithstanding that the appeal judge held that the justice of the peace 
  did not err in fact or law, he purported to upset her finding on the issue of 
  prejudice, He held, &quot;when an allegation such as this is hanging over the 
  corporation's head&#133;. I cannot see that there could be anything other than 
  prejudice&#133;. It is a local industrial company with this stigma hanging over 
  its head and it wants to mount the defence of due diligence. In the circumstances 
  I am satisfied that there would have been prejudice.&quot;</p>  <p>
  [9] Having obtained leave to appeal, the Crown appeals the decision of the appeal 
  judge dismissing its appeal. At the conclusion of the appeal this court allowed 
  the appeal with reasons to follow later. These are those reasons.</p>  <p>
  Analysis</p>  <p>
  [10] The appeal judge erred in inferring prejudice to the Company. There is 
  no evidentiary basis on which the court could reverse the finding of fact by 
  the justice of the peace that there was no prejudice and infer that the Company 
  would be stigmatized. </p>  <p>
  [11] In R. v. C.I.P. Inc. (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at 143 (S.C.C.) the Supreme 
  Court held that with respect to a corporate accused, the only interest engaged 
  under s. 11 (b) is the right to a fair trial. Hence, to succeed on a s. 11(b) 
  application, a corporate entity must persuade the court that its ability to 
  make full answer and defence has been impaired. Pre-charge delay is a factor 
  to consider respecting trial fairness: R. v. Morin (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 1 
  at 14 (S.C.C.); R. v. L. (W.K.) (1991), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at 328 (S.C.C). However, 
  there was no evidence that the pre-charge delay in this case adversely affected 
  the fairness of the trial.</p>  <p>
  [12] Similarly, while pre-charge delay may be a consideration on an abuse of 
  process motion, the mere existence of delay cannot justify granting a stay of 
  proceedings: R. v. L. (W.K.), supra, at 327; R. v. Francois (1993), 15 O.R. 
  (3d) 627 at 629 (C.A.). More particularly, in the absence of any evidence of 
  bad faith or ulterior motive, there was no basis for placing a burden on the 
  Crown to explain the investigative and prosecutorial processes. The charges 
  were laid within the one year limitation period set out in s. 69 of the Occupational 
  Health and Safety Act. In placing such a burden on the Crown, the lower courts 
  in effect imposed a judicially created limitation period, which they were not 
  entitled to do. See R. v. Rourke (1978), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 129 at 143 (S.C.C.) 
  and R. v. L. (W.K.), supra, at 328.</p>  <p>
  [13] The appeal is allowed, the decision of the appeal judge is set aside, the 
  Charter application is dismissed and the information is remitted to the Ontario 
  Court of Justice before a different justice of the peace for a trial on the 
  merits. </p>
