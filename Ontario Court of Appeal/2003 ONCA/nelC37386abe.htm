<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant raises three grounds of appeal. First, given that the trial
  judge determined that it was dangerous to accept the complainant's version
  of events in the absence of independent corroborative evidence, the trial judge
  erred by making findings of fact in the absence of such evidence. Second, the
  trial judge erred by failing to consider independent evidence inconsistent
  with the complainant's version of events, in particular, the evidence
  of the complainant's co-worker concerning the nature of the complainant's
  relationship with the appellant. Third, the trial judge failed to give due
  regard to the significance of the absence of evidence establishing that the
  complainant sustained physical injuries during the alleged sexual assault.</p>
<p>[2]	We would reject each of these grounds of appeal.</p>
<p>[3] Although the trial judge indicated that it would be very dangerous, in
    his view, in the circumstances of this case to rely on the complainant's
    evidence where that evidence was not corroborated by independent evidence,
    he properly recognized that corroboration is not required in a sexual assault
    case. The approach adopted by the trial judge benefited the appellant because
    it resulted in the application of a standard of proof higher than that required
    at law. In any event, the trial judge found ample corroborative evidence
    on the essential elements of the offences for which he found the appellant
    guilty.
    In our view, the trial judge did not err in his assessment of the evidence
  and there is no basis for appellate interference with his findings.</p>
