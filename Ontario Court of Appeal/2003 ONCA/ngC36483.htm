<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The appellant raises two grounds of appeal in support of his submission 
  that a new trial should be ordered following his three convictions for conspiracy 
  to utter counterfeit money.</p>    <P>
  Charge on the Co-Conspirators Exception to the Hearsay Rule</p>    <P>
  [2] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred by instructing the jury 
  on the co-conspirators exception to the hearsay rule when it was not necessary 
  and, further, that the charge was incorrect in a number of ways.</p>    <P>
  [3] We accept that the co-conspirators exception to the hearsay rule played 
  little, if any, role in the case. All of the evidence incriminating the appellant 
  emanated from Jennie Fung. Most of the out-of-court acts and declarations that 
  were admitted into evidence were statements made by Fung in taped conversations 
  with Lambertucci or the appellant. Fung testified and was cross-examined on 
  her testimony. In the circumstances, the hearsay nature of the out-of-court 
  acts and declarations was effectively rendered moot with the result that it 
  was unnecessary and probably undesirable to instruct on the co-conspirators 
  exception.</p>    <P>
  [4] That said, the effect of instructing the jury on the co-conspirators exception 
  could only have inured to the benefit of the appellant as it may have served 
  to keep the out-of-court statements from being used against the appellant and 
  any error in the instruction is, therefore, immaterial.</p>    <P>
  Instructions on the Elements of the Offences</p>    <P>
  [5] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his instructions to 
  the jury with respect to the essential elements of the offences. We disagree 
  with this submission for the following reasons.</p>    <P>
  [6] With respect to the appellant's argument that the trial judge needed to 
  assist the jury by identifying the nature of the three different conspiracies 
  and the evidence that related to each, we note that the essential elements of 
  each of the three conspiracy counts were the same; only the time frame and the 
  common unlawful object differed.</p>    <P>
  [7] In respect of the submission that the trial judge failed to put a significant 
  aspect of the defence theory to the jury, we note that the defence called no 
  evidence, it's theory was that Fung was lying and the trial judge made that 
  clear to the jury.</p>    <P>
  [8] Finally, the trial judge was entitled to express his opinion on the evidence 
  in respect of whether Fung was given a deal so that she would testify. The trial 
  judge did not remove the matter from the jury's consideration; he made it clear 
  that it was for the jury to decide the matter.</p>    <P>
  Conclusion</p>    <P>
  [9] Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal from conviction.</p>
