<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The issue in this medical malpractice case is whether the trial judge properly 
  applied the test for informed consent. There is no issue that the trial judge 
  properly stated the test. The test is whether, on a balance of probabilities, 
  a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have consented to the 
  treatment if all appropriate risks had been disclosed. This involves consideration 
  of (1) whether there has been adequate disclosure of the nature of the treatment 
  and its risks, and (2) whether the lack of disclosure caused the damage to the 
  patient. See Reibl v. Hughes (1978), 21 O.R. (2d) 14 at 26, (Ont. C.A.), rev'd 
  on other grounds, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 880; Arndt v. Smith, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 539; 
  Brassard v. Germain (1993), 65 O.A.C. 311.</p>
<p>
  [2] The facts giving rise to this appeal are not seriously in dispute and may 
  be summarized as follows. On December 18, 1997, Julie Nichols had an appointment 
  with Dr. Young. Her mother, Cheryl Nichols, accompanied her. Dr. Young had been 
  Julie Nichols' family physician since she was very young and had treated her 
  mother since May 1979. Julie Nichols asked Dr. Young about the possible use 
  of birth control pills because she had a history of painful periods and because 
  she had acne. At the time, she was not sexually active and did not need birth 
  control.</p>
<p>
  [3] Cheryl Nichols had once briefly taken birth control pills but was taken 
  off them because swelling developed in her leg. Cheryl Nichols had been advised 
  by Dr. Young not to take birth control pills because of problems with her blood. 
  Julie Nichols advised Dr. Young that both her grandmother and grandfather had 
  suffered from blood clots and that her aunt could not take birth control pills 
  because of blood clots. All three had been on Coumadin (a blood thinner). Julie 
  and Cheryl Nichols both asked Dr. Young whether it was appropriate for him to 
  prescribe birth control pills in the face of that family history. He purportedly 
  made a reassuring comment and did not discuss the risks associated with birth 
  control pills before prescribing them. He told Julie to read the pamphlet that 
  came with the pills, which she did.</p>
<p>
  [4] Julie Nichols began to take the pill shortly after the appointment. In March 
  of 1998, she began to experience pain in her rib cage on the left side. On March 
  18, 1998, Dr. Young saw Julie Nichols and told her she had pneumonia. On March 
  24, 1998, Julie Nichols' right leg was a light blue-grey colour, her foot was 
  very swollen and she could not lift the leg or bend it. The next day, Dr. Young 
  diagnosed Julie Nichols with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pleural effusion 
  (that is, fluid between the wall of the chest and the outside of the lung). 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] Julie Nichols was sent to Brantford General Hospital where she remained 
  for a week to 10 days. As a result of the DVT, Julie Nichols has developed post-phlebitic 
  syndrome, which is a chronic and progressive disease. She is on a blood thinner 
  and has her blood monitored regularly. She experiences a great deal of pain 
  and her ability to sit and stand for prolonged periods of time has been affected. 
  She has discovered that she has a condition called Factor V Leiden and that 
  this condition increased her risk of DVT. </p>
<p>
  [6] Julie Nichols brought an action claiming that Dr. Young was negligent in 
  three ways: in his prescription of the birth control pill; in his failure to 
  diagnose a pulmonary embolism in March 18, 1998; and in his failure to treat 
  her promptly on March 24, 1998. In addition, Julie Nichols claimed there was 
  a lack of informed consent when Dr. Young prescribed the birth control pill 
  for her without explaining the risk of blood clots associated with its use. 
  </p>
<p>
  [7] The trial judge made the following findings of fact: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) There was no history of thromboembolism in the family of 
  Julie Nichols before the pill was prescribed by Dr. Young;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) There was no contraindication for prescribing the pill when 
  Dr. Young prescribed it;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) At that time there was no reason to think that Julie Nichols 
  was at an increased risk of clotting because of her family history; </p>
<p class="indent">(d) Julie Nichols had medical reasons that justified the prescription 
  of the birth control pill and the prescription was in accordance with standard 
  practice to treat Julie Nichols conditions;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) Julie Nichols risks associated with the birth control pill 
  were those of the general population;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) Julie Nichols had some knowledge of a risk of blood clots 
  associated with the birth control pill at the time she accepted the prescription;</p>
<p class="indent">(g) She read the reference to blood clots in the brochure for 
  the medication and she continued to use it without asking Dr. Young for further 
  details; and</p>
<p class="indent">(h) Serious complications from the birth control pill in the 
  general population are rare for someone of Julie Nichols' age and habits.</p>
<p>
  [8] The trial judge concluded that Dr. Young met the standard of care when he 
  prescribed the pill to Julie Nichols. She further held that Julie Nichols failed 
  to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that she suffered from a pulmonary 
  embolism on March 18, 1998 and that Dr. Young therefore met the standard of 
  care in the treatment provided on March 18. The treatment of the DVT was also 
  found to be sufficiently prompt so that Dr. Young met the standard of care. 
  These conclusions are not under appeal. </p>
<p>
  [9] In relation to the issue of informed consent the trial judge found that 
  there was a lack of informed consent with respect to the prescription of the 
  birth control pill because Dr. Young did not adequately discuss the risk of 
  blood clots in the general population for a person taking birth control pills. 
  The trial judge found, however, that a reasonable person in Julie Nichols' position 
  would have taken the birth control pill had she been properly informed about 
  the level of risk. As such, the trial judge concluded that the lack of informed 
  consent did not cause any injury. This last conclusion is the subject of this 
  appeal.</p>
<p>
  [10] Julie Nichols' counsel submits, apparently for the first time on this appeal, 
  that the trial judge did not properly apply the test for informed consent because 
  she failed to consider a relevant factor. Specifically, because Cheryl Nichols 
  suffered from superficial vein thrombosis (varicose veins) and given the Nichols' 
  family history, the appellant submits there was an increased risk of Julie Nichols 
  suffering superficial vein thrombosis from taking the birth control pill. As 
  a result, Julie Nichols' counsel submits that the trial judge erred by failing 
  to give proper weight to the subjective aspect of the test and in concluding 
  that a reasonable person in Julie Nichols' position would have taken the birth 
  control pill.</p>
<p>
  [11] One of Dr. Young's experts, Dr. Yao, gave evidence about superficial vein 
  thrombosis. He testified that a person who uses estrogen compounds including 
  birth control pills has a two to four fold increased risk of venous thrombosis. 
  This referred to deep venous thrombosis as the field of superficial venous thrombosis 
  is largely understudied because it is so common in comparison to deep venous 
  thrombosis. While acknowledging that superficial venous thrombosis can be uncomfortable 
  and an unpleasant thing to have, Dr. Yao stated, &quot;We do make a clear distinction 
  between superficial and deep, and the reason we make a distinction is because 
  superficial venous thrombosis is very common, DVT is much rarer, and there is 
  no evidence that within family groups that superficial venous thrombosis, because 
  it doesn't lead to any significant sequela is something we worry very much about.&quot; 
  </p>
<p>
  [12] The focus of the evidence at trial was on deep venous thrombosis because 
  of the consequences of this risk and the unfortunate occurrence of deep venous 
  thrombosis to Julie Nichols. There is a lack of evidence concerning increased 
  risk of superficial venous thrombosis to Julie Nichols as a result of her family 
  history. There is no evidence from Julie Nichols that she would not have taken 
  the birth control pill had she known about the risk of superficial venous thrombosis. 
  </p>
<p>
  [13] We cannot accept the appellant's submission that the trial judge erred 
  in her conclusion that a reasonable person in Julie Nichols' circumstances would 
  have taken the birth control pill if she had been properly advised of its risks. 
  The appeal is dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [14] In all of the circumstances, we would not award any costs. </p>
