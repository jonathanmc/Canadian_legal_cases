<p>On appeal, by Mr. Nikitin, from the conviction by Justice Paul U. Rivard of 
  the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on April 2, 2002, and on 
  appeal, by the Crown, from the sentence imposed on May 31, 2002.<br>
</p>
<p>MACPHERSON J.A.:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] This is a sad case. John Nikitin, a 64 year old man with no criminal record, 
  a good family life and a lifetime of steady employment, was convicted of manslaughter 
  following a jury trial in North Bay presided over by Justice Paul U. Rivard.</p>
<p>[2] Nikitin was driving his truck and trailer. A school bus was parked at the 
  side of the road with its red warning lights flashing and its stop sign arm 
  extended. Five-year old Adam Ranger and his 12-year old brother, Alex, were 
  crossing the highway to the driveway of their home. Nikitin did not see the 
  boys until it was too late. He swerved to avoid them and crashed into the ditch. 
  Unfortunately, the trailer he was towing behind his truck struck Adam, killing 
  him instantly.</p>
<p>[3] The trial judge&#146;s charge to the jury was impeccable &#150; it was 
  not challenged in any respect by defence counsel at the trial nor is it challenged 
  on this appeal. However, Nikitin appeals his conviction on three grounds.</p>
<p>[4] The trial judge imposed a conditional sentence of 22 months and a five-year 
  driving prohibition. The Crown appeals the sentence.</p>
<p>A. Conviction Appeal<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Nikitin appeals his conviction on three grounds: (1) the admission of Crown 
  &#145;re-enactment&#146; or &#145;experiment&#146; evidence and the use made 
  of this evidence by Crown counsel in his closing address to the jury; (2) alleged 
  improprieties in Crown counsel&#146;s closing address in relation to Nikitin&#146;s 
  testimony; and (3) unreasonable verdict.</p>
<p>(1) Crown &#145;re-enactment&#146; or &#145;experiment&#146; evidence<br>
</p>
<p>[6] The day after the accident, one of the investigating officers, Constable 
  David Moore, returned to the scene with Constable Jonathan Dumond. They re-enacted 
  some of the events using the school bus from the incident and a vehicle similar 
  in size to Nikitin&#146;s truck. Constable Dumond retraced Nikitin&#146;s path 
  down Rochon Hill towards the Ranger house and the parked school bus. He was 
  instructed to stop when he saw the entire bus and its flashing lights. He did 
  so and measurements were taken. The distance from the &#145;point of first perception&#146; 
  to the school bus was 654 meters.</p>
<p>[7] At trial, Constable Moore testified about the re-enactment. In addition, 
  the videotape of the re-enactment was played for the jury and became an exhibit.</p>
<p>[8] Nikitin contends that the re-enactment or experiment evidence rendered 
  the trial unfair in three respects: (1) Constable Moore&#146;s testimony constituted 
  impermissible opinion evidence that did not comply with the admissibility criteria 
  set out in R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9; (2) there were problems and deficiencies 
  with the evidence that should have led to its exclusion; and (3) Crown counsel 
  used the re-enactment or experiment evidence in an improper fashion in his closing 
  address.</p>
<p>[9] I do not accept these submissions. Although not determinative, I note that 
  defence counsel at trial made no objection to the admission of either Constable 
  Moore&#146;s testimony or the videotape, to Crown counsel&#146;s closing address, 
  or to the trial judge&#146;s charge on this issue.</p>
<p>[10] The evidence relating to the partial re-enactment the day after the incident 
  was not opinion evidence; rather it was evidence of facts observed during a 
  pre-trial re-enactment or experiment. The essence of Constable Moore&#146;s 
  testimony was factual in nature. He described the conditions of the experiment 
  and the results, in numerical terms, that it produced. The Crown did not ask 
  him, and he did not give, expert opinion evidence with respect to the experiment.</p>
<p>[11] Turning to Nikitin&#146;s second submission, I begin with the observation 
  that the words &#145;re-enactment&#146; and &#145;experiment&#146; are both 
  apt descriptors of the police evidence. &#145;Re-enactment&#146; is accurate 
  because the police sought to replicate the conditions (location, vehicles, time 
  of day, weather) and some, but not all, of the relevant events (driving until 
  the bus was seen, but not to point of impact). &#145;Experiment&#146; is also 
  accurate because the purpose of the partial re-enactment was to identify the 
  potential &#145;point of first perception&#146; of the school bus by a driver.</p>
<p>[12] Nikitin objects to Constable Moore&#146;s testimony about the experiment 
  component of the re-enactment. On that issue, the parties acknowledge that the 
  leading case is R. v. Collins (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 85 (Ont. C.A.). In that 
  case, Charron J.A. observed that the general principles of evidence &#151; reliability, 
  materiality and prejudice &#151; apply to experiment evidence. She continued, 
  at pp. 95-96:</p>
<p class="indent">A pre-trial experiment can be as simple as driving from one 
  location to another to determine the time it takes to cover the distance in 
  order to substantiate or disprove an alibi, or driving along a particular stretch 
  of road to determine at what point a stop sign becomes visible. The evidence 
  in such cases, provided that it is relevant to an issue in the case, will usually 
  be admitted without argument. It is entirely factual, and its admissibility 
  is only subject to the general principles of relevance, materiality and discretion 
  as discussed earlier. ...</p>
<p class="indent">In a nutshell, experiment evidence, if it is relevant to an 
  issue in the case, should generally be admitted, subject to the trial judge&#146;s 
  residuary discretion to exclude the evidence where the prejudice that would 
  flow from its admission clearly outweighs its value. ...</p>
<p class="indent">In most cases, the relevance of the experiment evidence will 
  depend on the degree of similarity between the replication and the original 
  event. Consider the example given earlier where the experiment consists of the 
  driving along a particular stretch of road to determine at what point a stop 
  sign becomes visible. If the distance at which the stop sign becomes visible 
  is in issue at trial, the experiment evidence will be material, but will only 
  be relevant if the replication bears some similarity to the original event. 
  For example, if the original event occurred in the summer when vegetation partly 
  obstructed the driver&#146;s view but the experiment was conducted in winter 
  after all the leaves had fallen, the relevance of the evidence will be greatly 
  diminished. Depending on all the circumstances, it may not be worth receiving.</p>
<p>[13] Nikitin submits that there were problems with the experiment evidence 
  that should have led the trial judge to exclude it, even though defence counsel 
  at trial did not object. The problems cited by Nikitin on the appeal are: (1) 
  a potential difference in the height of Nikitin&#146;s truck and the police 
  van; (2) the fact that Constable Dumond was 28 years old and Nikitin was 64, 
  and that visual acuity diminishes with age; (3) the fact that Constable Dumond 
  wore sunglasses during the re-enactment whereas Nikitin was not wearing them 
  the day before; (4) the fact that the police van approached the scene very slowly, 
  whereas Nikitin was driving near the speed limit of 90 kilometers per hour; 
  and (5) the important feature that Constable Dumond was expecting to see a school 
  bus whereas Nikitin was not. </p>
<p>[14] I do not agree that these factors rendered the experiment sufficiently 
  unreliable that the trial judge should have excluded Constable Moore&#146;s 
  testimony concerning it. It is impossible for a pre-trial experiment to replicate 
  the original event perfectly. In this case, the police took pains to replicate 
  the relevant events as best they could &#151; experiment conducted next day, 
  at the same time of day, similar weather conditions, similar vehicles, same 
  school bus put in the same position. Moreover, Constable Moore was completely 
  candid in acknowledging some of the factors that could potentially diminish 
  the accuracy of the experiment evidence, including the fact that visual acuity 
  diminishes with age and the fact that a person will probably see an object sooner 
  if he is expecting to see it.</p>
<p>[15] In addition, and importantly, the trial judge was comprehensive and scrupulous 
  in his charge to the jury on this issue. He identified all of the factors that 
  the defence suggested should diminish the weight to be given to the experiment 
  evidence.</p>
<p>[16] In summary, in Collins at 96, Charron J.A. stated that experiment evidence 
  should generally be admitted, subject to a residuary discretion to exclude it 
  if the prejudice that would flow from its admission clearly outweighs its value. 
  In this case, I am of the view that the experiment evidence comfortably fell 
  on the general rule side of the line.</p>
<p>[17] Nikitin&#146;s third submission on this issue is that Crown counsel made 
  too much of the experiment evidence in his closing address. I disagree. Crown 
  counsel expressly acknowledged that the re-enactment was not &#147;an exact 
  scientific depiction of what Mr. Nikitin saw.&#148; Moreover, the Crown was 
  entitled to present its case to the jury, including its reliance on a potential 
  point of perception of 654 meters, in a blunt and forceful fashion. Defence 
  counsel was entitled to deal with this evidence in a similar vein. Indeed, he 
  did so, telling the jury: &#147;I&#146;ll tell you right now, that evidence 
  is useless. That point of first perception is meaningless.&#133;You don&#146;t 
  know anything about Mr. Nikitin&#146;s point of first perception other than 
  what Mr. Nikitin tells you. And what he tells you makes sense. What Constable 
  Moore tells you makes no sense.&#148;</p>
<p>(2) Crown counsel&#146;s closing address<br>
</p>
<p>[18] Nikitin contends that Crown counsel&#146;s closing address to the jury 
  was improper, and should have been corrected in the trial judge&#146;s charge 
  to the jury, in two respects: (1) he stated that Nikitin&#146;s testimony about 
  the sun being a factor in his inability to see the school bus should be discounted 
  because it arose in response to a leading question from his counsel; and (2) 
  he invited the jury to draw an adverse inference from the fact that other vehicles 
  stopped in front of the bus immediately after the accident.</p>
<p>[19] I do not agree with these submissions. I see nothing wrong with either 
  statement by the Crown. Frankly, they strike me as innocuous components of a 
  comprehensive jury address. </p>
<p>(3) Unreasonable verdict<br>
</p>
<p>[20] Nikitin contends that the jury verdict was unreasonable in that no reasonable 
  jury acting judicially could have been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that 
  Nikitin had intentionally or recklessly failed to stop for the school bus.</p>
<p>[21] I disagree. On my review of the record, Nikitin received a fair trial 
  presided over by an experienced judge, a good defence from his counsel, including 
  a strong closing address, and an impeccable jury charge. The jury&#146;s verdict 
  was not unreasonable.</p>
<p>B. Sentence appeal<br>
</p>
<p>[22] The Crown submits that a conditional sentence of 22 months for manslaughter 
  was demonstrably unfit.</p>
<p>[23] I disagree. There is no rule that disentitles a trial judge from considering 
  a conditional sentence for the serious offence of manslaughter: see R. v. Turcotte 
  (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 139 (Ont. C.A.). The trial judge carefully reviewed 
  all relevant factors. He noted that Nikitin was 65 years old, had been married 
  for 41 years, was an excellent parent and a conscientious and reliable worker, 
  and had no criminal record. He also observed that since the tragic incident, 
  Nikitin had suffered a series of heart attacks. In spite of this, he had managed 
  to provide considerable support and care to his wife who suffers from serious 
  physical ailments.</p>
<p>[24] In light of these factors, and bearing in mind the trial judge&#146;s 
  careful review of the relevant sentencing provisions and principles, I cannot 
  say that the sentence he imposed was unfit, especially in light of the deference 
  that must be shown to sentences imposed by a trial judge: see R. v. Shropshire, 
  [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, and R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61.</p>
<p>Disposition<br>
</p>
<p>[25] I would dismiss Nikitin&#146;s conviction appeal. I would grant leave 
  to the Crown to appeal the sentence and would dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
