<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal from the order of Justice Greer of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated November 14, 2001 in which she dismissed the appellants' 
  application to set aside the default judgment of Justice Festeryga of the Superior 
  Court dated July 10, 2001. </p>
<p> [2] Counsel for the appellants argued that because the cause of action asserted 
  in the statement of claim was for fraud, that the resulting judgment for $143,462.06 
  was not a liquidated sum as required by rule 19.04 (1)(a). Counsel relied upon 
  the judgment of this court in Schill et al v. Gallagher [2001], O.J. No. 260. 
  We are satisfied that the Schill case is distinguishable from the case at bar. 
  In that case, the court had some doubt as to the amount in issue and the need 
  to justify it. We have no such doubt in this case. The amount of $143,462.06 
  was supported by a detailed schedule of invoices. In any event, we note that 
  the court in Schill simply set aside the default judgment with leave to the 
  plaintiff to move again on proper material. The court refused to set aside the 
  noting in default. </p>
<p> [3] Counsel for the appellant raised other arguments concerning the service 
  of the statement of claim and the failure to comply with the provisions of Rule 
  19. We are satisfied that there was proper service of the statement of claim, 
  that the default judgment was properly obtained under rule 19.04 (1)(a) and 
  that Greer J. properly applied the test for setting aside a default judgment 
  as set out in Chitel v. Rothbart [1988], O.J. No. 1197. </p>
<p> [4] In our view, Justice Greer committed no error in principle in refusing 
  to exercise her discretion to set aside the default judgment. Accordingly the 
  appeal is dismissed. It is unnecessary to deal with the motion to quash the 
  appeal and the related issue concerning the filing of fresh evidence. However, 
  we do wish to note that counsel for the respondent acknowledged that there was 
  substantial duplication between the judgment of Festeryga J. and a restitution 
  order of the Ontario Court of Justice dated January 23, 2003. Counsel for the 
  respondent made it clear that his client had no intention of pursuing double 
  recovery.</p>
<p> [5] The respondent shall have its costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity 
  basis fixed at $4,800 including disbursements and Goods and Services Tax.</p>
