<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Susan G. Himel of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated November 13, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are not persuaded that Himel J. erred in the exercise of her discretion, 
  which was based upon her evaluation of the factors to be considered when determining 
  whether to grant a stay in these proceedings. It was clearly open to the motions 
  judge to find, as she did, that the oppression remedy was legitimately sought 
  and, as a consequence of that finding, that it could not be said that the California 
  courts have exclusive jurisdiction in the matter. </p> <P>
  [2] Even if it could be said that the motions judge's statements about the burden 
  of proof are somewhat confusing, we see no basis to interfere. As this court 
  said in Frymer v. Brettscheinerder et al. (1994), 115 D.L.R. (4th) 744 (Ont. 
  C.A.), the burden will rarely matter since the issue is normally resolved on 
  the basis of the evidence and that is precisely how the motions judge resolved 
  the matter.</p> <P>
  [3] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed. Costs to the respondent are 
  fixed in the amount of $12,000. </p>
