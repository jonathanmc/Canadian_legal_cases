<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants submit that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding 
  error in failing to reconcile the lack of documentary evidence supporting the 
  respondent&#146;s claim. Counsel points out in particular that even in the final 
  October 1998 letter, the respondent does not expressly set out the amount of 
  the capital count that he had accumulated through so-called sweat equity. He 
  also points out that throughout the six-year relationship there was nothing 
  in writing to support the respondent&#146;s position and the various documents 
  authored by Mr. Zaharchuk seem to be at variance with the 1992 Agreement. </p>
<p>[2] The trial judge referred to all of this evidence. In the end, as counsel 
  fairly concedes, this case turned on credibility. The trial judge correctly 
  framed the issue and we can only interfere with her findings of credibility 
  if she made a palpable and overriding error in her assessment. See Housen v. 
  Rural Municipality of Shellbrook No. 493 (2002), 211 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>[3] The trial judge accepted the respondent&#146;s evidence including his explanations 
  for his conduct after May 1992. Despite Mr. Chapman&#146;s thorough and helpful 
  submissions, we are satisfied that the trial judge was entitled to accept the 
  respondent&#146;s evidence. That evidence, if believed, provided a basis for 
  her legal conclusions. While we might have come to a different conclusion, that 
  is not the test for review of factual, including credibility, findings.</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $25,000 inclusive 
  of disbursements and GST.</p>
