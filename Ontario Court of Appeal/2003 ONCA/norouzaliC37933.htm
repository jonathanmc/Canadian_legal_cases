<p>On appeal from the convictions imposed by Justice Harry LaForme of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated March 20, 1998.</p>
<p>GILLESE J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] Following a trial with a jury, the appellant Roshan Norouzali was convicted 
  of two counts of first degree murder; two counts of robbery; use of a firearm; 
  four counts of attempted murder; and, possession of a prohibited weapon. He 
  was sentenced to life imprisonment with no parole eligibility for twenty-five 
  years. The appellant appeals from the convictions.</p>
<p>[2] The appellant was tried with a co-accused, Ronald Woodcock, who was convicted 
  of first degree murder and several other offences. The co-accused also appeals 
  from the convictions. Reasons for judgment on the co-accused&#146;s appeal are 
  being released contemporaneously with these reasons.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant raised a number of grounds of appeal but pursued only two 
  at the hearing of the appeal. First, he argues that the trial judge&#146;s instructions 
  to the jury on the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt were fatally flawed. 
  Second, he contends that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury 
  on first degree murder during the course of forcible seizure. </p>
<p>[4] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>OVERVIEW<br>
</p>
<p>[5] On September 14, 1994, Ken Thomas was shot and killed near the Pickering 
  Nuclear Generating Station. Thomas&#146; car was used later the same day as 
  the getaway vehicle for a robbery at Gagnon Sporting Stores (&#147;Gagnons&#148;). 
  Two people committed the Gagnons robbery. During the robbery, one of the perpetrators 
  fired six shots from a rifle equipped with a silencer, killing the store owner 
  and injuring three others. The same firearm had been used to kill Thomas. The 
  second perpetrator smashed a gun case and stole eleven handguns. The robbers 
  took only guns from Gagnons. They did not demand money. </p>
<p>[6] The robbers fled from Gagnons in Thomas&#146; car. The appellant&#146;s 
  blood was found at Gagnons on glass fragments from the gun case and in Thomas&#146; 
  car. </p>
<p>[7] On March 10, 1995, the appellant, Woodcock and a third person, Deryck Thompson, 
  were arrested after robbing a National Grocers store in St. Thomas, Ontario. 
  During the robbery, all three were armed with loaded handguns. The handguns 
  possessed by the appellant and Thompson were two of the guns stolen from Gagnons. 
  Woodcock was armed with a .38 revolver, which he used to shoot an employee in 
  the leg. The .38 was not linked to any other robbery. The appellant, Woodcock 
  and Thompson all pleaded guilty to various charges arising from this incident.</p>
<p>[8] The trial judge admitted, as similar fact evidence, evidence of five armed 
  robberies committed between September 19, 1994 and March 10, 1995. The fifth 
  robbery, committed on March 10, 1995, was the robbery described in the immediately 
  preceding paragraph. The appellant and two co-accused were convicted of the 
  March 10th robbery prior to the trial at issue in the instant appeal. </p>
<p>THE FACTS <br>
</p>
<p>The Killing of Ken Thomas<br>
</p>
<p>[9] Ken Thomas was last seen alive on the morning of September 14, 1994. There 
  was evidence that he was in Richmond Hill around noon that day. </p>
<p>[10] A fisherman found Thomas&#146; body on January 21, 1995 near the Pickering 
  Nuclear Generating Station. There was no discernible reason for Thomas to be 
  at this location. However, in the past he had worked as a carpenter at the generating 
  station and would have had access to the paths in the vicinity.</p>
<p>[11] Thomas&#146; body was found in a clump of trees approximately fifteen 
  to twenty feet inside the chain link fence that surrounded the generating station. 
  The fence was six feet high and topped with barbed wire. There was a nearby 
  gate in the fence but it was padlocked. There was also a nearby gap in the fence 
  caused by a drain way under which one could crawl. Security personnel guarded 
  all other entrances. The first police officer to examine the scene reached the 
  body by throwing a jacket over the barbed wire and climbing the fence. Once 
  inside the fence, the area leading to the body was rugged scrubland with dense 
  undergrowth.</p>
<p>[12] Thomas had been shot once in the back of the neck and three times through 
  the left side of his head. One bullet was found in his skull and another three 
  embedded in the ground near his skull. Expert evidence was led to the effect 
  that Thomas had been executed at the site where his body was found. </p>
<p>[13] At the time of his disappearance, Thomas owned a 1989 two tone dark maroon 
  Chevrolet Caprice. His car was identified as being parked at Gagnons at about 
  2:00 p.m. on the day of the robbery. The gun used to kill Thomas was the same 
  gun that was used in the Gagnons robbery. </p>
<p>The Robbery and Shootings at Gagnons<br>
</p>
<p>[14] On September 14, 1994, shortly after 5:00 p.m., two masked men entered 
  Gagnons. One of the men was armed with a rifle. The armed man yelled &#147;Okay, 
  this is it. This is a hold-up. Everybody get down&#148;. An employee responded 
  &#147;You must be joking&#148;. The same man responded &#147;This ain&#146;t 
  no fuckin&#146; joke&#148; and shot the employee in the arm. The sound was muffled 
  by a silencer, as were the subsequent gunshots. Roger Pardy, the owner of the 
  store, was on the phone when the robbers entered. The shooter yelled at him 
  &#147;I told you to get down and I&#146;m not fuckin&#146; kidding&#148; and 
  then shot him twice. The first shot hit him in the right back shoulder. The 
  second shot struck him in the right temple and killed him.</p>
<p>[15] Two other people at Gagnons were injured by three separate bullets. Forensic 
  testing showed that the six .22 calibre shell casings recovered from the scene 
  were from the same firearm. </p>
<p>[16] While the shootings occurred, the second perpetrator smashed a display 
  case containing handguns. Prior to reaching the cabinet, this person had yelled 
  out &#147;Everybody get down. If anybody moves, kill them&#148;. </p>
<p>[17] Eleven handguns were stolen including a Colt .45 (the &#147;Colt&#148;) 
  and a Ruger .45 (the &#147;Ruger&#148;) calibre handgun. Despite its availability, 
  no money was taken from the store or demanded. The events took place in a period 
  of approximately 90 seconds or less.</p>
<p>[18] Several witnesses to the Gagnons robbery gave various descriptions of 
  the two robbers. None of the witnesses could identify the appellant or Woodcock. 
  Descriptions of the shooter ranged from 5&#146;4&#148; to a person over 5&#146;9&#148; 
  with a thick build and a deep voice. The second robber was described as being 
  slightly taller than the shooter. The booking officer testified that at the 
  time of their arrest, Woodcock was 5&#146;6&#148; tall and 150 pounds and the 
  appellant was 5&#146;9&#148; and 165 pounds. </p>
<p>[19] A car consistent with the description of Thomas&#146; car was seen near 
  Gagnons from about 2:00 p.m. and on into the afternoon. </p>
<p>[20] A witness observed two individuals leave this vehicle and enter Gagnons. 
  The driver was masked and his visible hand was wrapped. The driver appeared 
  to be about 5&#146;7&#148; to 5&#146;8&#148; and was stockier than the passenger. 
  The witness called 9-1-1. </p>
<p>[21] Witnesses who saw the two robbers leaving Gagnons also gave various descriptions. 
  One witness described them both as 5&#146;10&#148; and well built, in the 200 
  pound range, and the driver as clean shaven and white. Another witness described 
  the driver as dark with some facial hair that was greying. </p>
<p>[22] On September 15, Thomas&#146; car was located behind an apartment building 
  in Oshawa approximately 1 kilometre from Gagnons. The vehicle was impounded 
  and held for expert examination. Blood smears were found in the vehicle. DNA 
  analysis showed it was the appellant&#146;s blood. </p>
<p>[23] Blood found on the smashed display case in Gagnons matched the appellant&#146;s 
  DNA. No forensic evidence linked Woodcock to either Gagnons or Thomas&#146; 
  car.</p>
<p>[24] On the morning of September 15, 1994, the appellant and Woodcock were 
  seen together in London, Ontario. </p>
<p>[25] The trial judge admitted, as similar fact evidence, evidence of 5 other 
  robberies upon which the Crown relied to establish the identity of the appellant 
  and Woodcock. The admissibility of such evidence is not challenged in this appeal. 
</p>
<p>ANALYSIS<br>
</p>
<p>ISSUE #1 THE JURY INSTRUCTION ON REASONABLE DOUBT</p>
<p>[26] The appellant alleges three defects in the trial judge&#146;s instruction 
  on the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. He contends that: </p>
<p class="indent">1. the trial judge ought to have told the jury that proof beyond 
  a reasonable doubt was reached when they were &#147;sure&#148; of the accused&#146;s 
  guilt;</p>
<p class="indent">2. the trial judge erred when he instructed the jury that a 
  reasonable doubt was not a &#147;possible doubt&#148;; and,</p>
<p class="indent">3. the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that proof beyond 
  a reasonable doubt was more than proof on a balance of probability and, in fact, 
  closer to absolute certainty.</p>
<p>[27] The trial judge&#146;s initial instruction on the meaning of reasonable 
  doubt reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">It is a matter of law that a person accused of a crime is presumed 
  to be innocent. This means that that you must start with the presumption that 
  each of Mr. Woodcock and Mr. Norouzali is innocent. This presumption of innocence 
  continues throughout the trial and entitles the defendant to a verdict of not 
  guilty unless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that they are guilty.</p>
<p class="indent">Every crime is made up of parts referred to as elements. The 
  Crown must prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant 
  or the accused is not required to prove his innocence, or, for that matter, 
  to do anything except deny his guilt and each has done that by pleading not 
  guilty. If you find that the Crown has not proven every element of an offence 
  beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the defendant not guilty of that 
  offence.</p>
<p class="indent">A reasonable doubt in a criminal trial is a fair, honest doubt 
  growing out of the evidence or lack of evidence. It is rarely possible to prove 
  anything with absolute or mathematical certainty and so the burden of proof 
  on the Crown is to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but not to the degree 
  of absolute or mathematical certainty. A reasonable doubt is not merely an imaginary 
  or possible doubt. Rather, it is a doubt based on reason and common sense. So 
  in the end, a reasonable doubt is just that: a doubt that is reasonable after 
  a logical, careful and considered examination of the facts and circumstances 
  of this case [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[28] In R. v. Lifchus (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1, the Supreme Court of Canada 
  set out the essential components of a charge on the meaning of reasonable doubt 
  and warned against the inclusion of others. Justice Cory gave the following 
  summary of what the definition of reasonable doubt should contain (at p. 13): </p>
<p class="indent">The standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is inextricably 
  intertwined with that principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the presumption 
  of innocence;</p>
<p class="indent">The burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the 
  trial and never shifts to the accused;</p>
<p class="indent">A reasonable doubt is not a doubt based on sympathy or prejudice;</p>
<p class="indent">Rather, it is based upon reason and common sense;</p>
<p class="indent">It is logically connected to the evidence or absence of evidence;</p>
<p class="indent">It does not involve proof to an absolute certainty; it is not 
  proof beyond any doubt nor is it an imaginary or frivolous doubt; and</p>
<p class="indent">More is required than proof that the accused is probably guilty&#151;a 
  jury which concludes only that the accused is probably guilty must acquit.</p>
<p>[29] Subsequent decisions have held that appellate courts should take a broad 
  approach in determining whether a charge complies with the Lifchus standard. 
  In R. v. Avetysan (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 77 (S.C.C.) at 84, Major J. stated 
  the &#147;substantial compliance&#148; test for appellate review of a jury charge 
  in this way: </p>
<p class="indent">A jury charge given before or after the Lifchus decision should not be faulted 
  merely for imprecise language. Rather, as was stated in Starr, supra, it should 
  be reviewed to determine whether it substantially complies with the Lifchus 
  principles. As applied in Russell, supra, and Beauchamp, supra, the basic question 
  remains: Does the charge, read as a whole, give rise to a reasonable likelihood 
  that the jury misapprehended the correct standard of proof? If not, the charge 
  is adequate [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>[30] It is clear that, in many respects, the trial judge&#146;s charge in the 
  instant appeal complies with Lifchus. The relationship between the presumption 
  of innocence and the Crown&#146;s burden to prove its case beyond a reasonable 
  doubt is clearly set out, as is the fact that the burden never shifts to the 
  accused. Further, the trial judge states the need to logically examine the facts 
  of the case before determining whether there is a reasonable doubt. The trial 
  judge also states that a reasonable doubt is based on &#147;reason and common 
  sense&#148; and does not require &#147;mathematical certainty&#148;.</p>
<p>[31] The first error alleged by the appellant is the trial judge&#146;s failure 
  to instruct the jury that it could convict only if sure of the accused&#146;s 
  guilt. I do not agree that this omission constitutes an error.</p>
<p>[32] Justice Cory concludes his suggested charge in Lifchus with the instruction 
  that &#147;&#133; if, based upon the evidence before this court, you are sure 
  that the accused committed the offence you should convict since this demonstrates 
  that you are satisfied of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt&#148;. However, 
  for several reasons, I do not find that the failure to instruct a jury that 
  they may convict only if they are &#147;sure&#148; the accused is guilty constitutes 
  an error.</p>
<p>[33] In his analysis of what should be in the definition of reasonable doubt, 
  Cory J. states (at p. 12): </p>
<p class="indent">In the United Kingdom juries are instructed that they may convict 
  if they are &#147;sure&#148; or &#147;certain&#148; of the accused&#146;s guilt. 
  Yet, in my view that instruction standing alone is both insufficient and potentially 
  misleading. Being &#147;certain&#148; is a conclusion which a juror may reach 
  but, it does not indicate the route the juror should take in order to arrive 
  at that conclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">It is only after proper instructions have been given as to the 
  meaning of the expression &#147;beyond a reasonable doubt&#148; that a jury 
  may be advised that they can convict if they are &#147;certain&#148; or &#147;sure&#148; 
  that the accused is guilty [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[34] It is clear from the above passage that references to the word &#147;sure&#148; 
  do not assist a jury in understanding the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable 
  doubt. Rather, it is the meaning of reasonable doubt that a jury must consider 
  before determining whether they are &#147;sure&#148; that the accused is guilty.</p>
<p>[35] Further, Cory J. states only that a jury &#147;may&#148; be advised that 
  they can convict if they are sure that the accused is guilty. I do not read 
  the instruction as being mandatory. He does not refer to the jury being &#147;sure&#148; 
  when he summarizes what should be explained to the jury. I would note, as well, 
  that while Cory J. does include the reference in his model charge, the introduction 
  to that charge makes clear that a charge which is consistent with the principles 
  set out will suffice regardless of the particular words used by the trial judge 
  (at pp. 13 &#150; 14). </p>
<p>[36] In the instant appeal, the trial judge scrupulously referred to the onus 
  and burden on the Crown to prove each of the elements of each offence beyond 
  a reasonable doubt throughout his charge to the jury. There can be no concern 
  that the jury did not understand that it had to be &#147;sure&#148; of the appellant&#146;s 
  guilt before it could convict in the sense that it had to first conclude that 
  the Crown had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>[37] The second alleged error lies in the trial judge&#146;s statement that 
  &#147;a reasonable doubt is not merely an imaginary or possible doubt.&#148; 
  The appellant argues that this instruction could mislead jurors into believing 
  that if they felt it was only &#147;possible&#148; that the appellant had not 
  committed the alleged offence, they must nonetheless convict. </p>
<p>[38] I accept that references to &#147;possible&#148; doubt should be avoided. 
  In R. v. Campbell (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 6, for example, this court considered 
  an instruction that if the evidence left only a remote possibility in favour 
  of the accused, which possibility could be dismissed because &#147;of course 
  it is possible but not in the least probable&#148;, then the case was proved 
  beyond a reasonable doubt. This court found the instruction objectionable as 
  it could have led the jury to conclude that &#147;a reasonable doubt must be 
  founded on probabilities as opposed to possibilities, whereas reasonable possibilities 
  in the accused&#146;s favour may give rise to a reasonable doubt&#148; (at p. 
  22). </p>
<p>[39] However, in my view, the trial judge&#146;s reference to a &#147;possible 
  doubt&#148; in the instant appeal does not raise a risk that the jury would 
  have misunderstood the standard it was to apply. The word &#147;possible&#148; 
  is juxtaposed with that of an &#147;imaginary&#148; doubt and follows the trial 
  judge&#146;s explanation that the Crown need not prove its case to the degree 
  of &#147;absolute or mathematical certainty&#148;. In this context, a juror 
  would understand the reference to &#147;possible doubt&#148; as simply another 
  way of articulating that the Crown need not prove its case to an absolute certainty. 
  For the same reason, I do not accept the argument that a juror might have understood 
  the word &#147;possible&#148; to apply to his or her consideration of the appellant&#146;s 
  innocence. </p>
<p>[40] The last alleged error on the reasonable doubt instruction is the trial 
  judge&#146;s failure to state that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a higher 
  standard than the balance of probability. In this respect, the charge does not 
  strictly comply with the terms in Lifchus. However, for the reasons that follow, 
  I do not find that this omission constitutes a reversible error.</p>
<p>[41] In R. v. Rhee (2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) at 139, Arbour J. applied 
  the substantial compliance standard of review as articulated in Avetysan, stressing 
  that evaluating the consequence of errors in a charge on reasonable doubt is 
  a case specific exercise and shortcomings must be assessed in the context of 
  the entire trial. </p>
<p>[42] In Rhee, the trial judge did not instruct the jury that probable guilt 
  was insufficient. However, Arbour J. found that this deficiency was cured by 
  the trial judge&#146;s instructions on circumstantial evidence. Regarding circumstantial 
  evidence, the trial judge in Rhee instructed the jury that &#147;you must be 
  satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that where it is relied upon to support 
  a guilty verdict the guilt of the accused is the only reasonable inference to 
  be drawn from the facts you have found them to be.&#148; Arbour J.A. concluded 
  that &#147;any concern that the jury may have applied a probable guilt standard 
  disappears upon consideration of these instructions with regard to circumstantial 
  evidence&#148; (at p.143). </p>
<p>[43] In the instant appeal, at trial the Crown relied on circumstantial evidence 
  in the crucial aspects of its case against the appellant. The trial judge delivered 
  a thorough and careful charge on the permissible use of this evidence, including 
  the following passage: </p>
<p class="indent">With respect to circumstantial evidence, the Crown does not discharge the burden 
  of proof beyond a reasonable doubt unless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the proven facts is 
  the guilt of the accused. In this case, circumstantial evidence bears particularly 
  on the issue of identity of each of Mr. Woodcock and Mr. Norouzali. </p>
<p>[44] The trial judge gave similar &#147;only reasonable inference&#148; and 
  &#147;no other rational conclusion&#148; instructions on four subsequent occasions. 
  For example, in his charge on attempt murder, the trial judge instructed the 
  jury that &#147;since the evidence of intent is circumstantial, you may infer 
  that intent to kill only if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that 
  inference is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the proven facts.&#148;</p>
<p>[45] In my view, whether the alleged errors are considered singly or in combination, 
  a consideration of the charge as a whole, the nature of the case against the 
  appellant, the trial judge&#146;s instruction on circumstantial evidence and 
  his introductory charge on reasonable doubt leads me to conclude that there 
  is no reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the standard of proof.</p>
<p>ISSUE #2 -- FIRST DEGREE MURDER DURING THE COURSE OF FORCIBLE SEIZURE</p>
<p>[46] The trial judge instructed the jury that they could find the appellant 
  guilty of first degree murder in the death of Ken Thomas either by way of planning 
  and deliberation or murder committed in the course of a forcible confinement. 
  He said the following: </p>
<p class="indent">Irrespective or regardless of whether a murder is planned and 
  deliberate on the part of any person, murder is first degree murder when the 
  death is caused while committing or attempting to commit the offence of forcible 
  seizure. Therefore, and this will only apply to the murder of Kenneth Thomas, 
  if the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Woodcock or Mr. Norouzali 
  murdered him, it will be first degree murder if it occurred during the commission 
  of or attempted commission of the forcible seizure of Kenneth Thomas. A forcible 
  seizure occurs where a person is taken or grasped or snatched without the person&#146;s 
  consent by the use of force or threats of force. The seizure must include an 
  element of unlawful control over that person that is more than momentary grasping 
  or apprehension. Thus, if the Crown has proven murder beyond a reasonable doubt, 
  it must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it occurred during the commission 
  or attempted commission of the offence of forcible seizure of Kenneth Thomas.</p>
<p class="indent">The Criminal Code provides that forcible seizure becomes first 
  degree murder when the death of the person seized is caused by that person while 
  committing or attempting to commit forcible seizure. The words &#147;by that 
  person&#148; ordinarily limit the application of the provision to the person 
  who actually caused the death; for example, the shooter. Generally speaking, 
  therefore, a co-accused could not be convicted of first degree murder under 
  this provision solely on the basis that he aided and abetted and was a party 
  to the offence of forcible seizure of Kenneth Thomas. However, both Mr. Woodcock 
  and Mr. Norouzali can both be convicted under this provision if you find both 
  were substantial causes of Kenneth Thomas&#146; death. That is the Crown must 
  establish beyond a reasonable doubt that both committed an act or series of 
  acts which are of such a nature that they must be regarded as a substantial 
  and integral cause of death. Each of them must have played a very active, usually 
  physical, role in the killing.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">By way of summary, for the Crown to satisfy you that Mr. Woodcock 
  and Mr. Norouzali or both is guilty of first degree murder of Kenneth Thomas, 
  under this provision of law, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
  that Mr. Woodcock or Mr. Norouzali or both forcibly seized or attempted to forcibly 
  seize Kenneth Thomas and, two, while forcibly seizing or attempting to forcibly 
  seize Kenneth Thomas, Mr. Woodcock or Mr. Norouzali or both murdered Kenneth 
  Thomas. Thereafter, if the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt the identity 
  of the person who actually caused the death, that is the shooter, but the other 
  was not a substantial and integral cause of death, you would find the shooter 
  guilty of first degree murder and the other not guilty of first degree murder 
  but guilty of second degree murder. Or, if the Crown cannot prove beyond a reasonable 
  doubt which of them actually caused the death of Mr. Thomas but proves that 
  one of them did and if the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that each 
  of them was a substantial and integral cause of Kenneth Thomas&#146; death, 
  you would find them both guilty of first degree murder [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[47] No objection to the instruction was made. Both defence counsel specifically 
  approved of the trial judge&#146;s instruction now challenged on appeal. However, 
  after a question from the jury as to the difference between first and second 
  degree murder, defence counsel did request a recharge to the effect that, if 
  either of the accused was a substantial participant in the forcible seizure 
  but the jury had a doubt as to which one may have done it, first degree murder 
  could not lie with respect to either accused. The emphasized portion of the 
  above excerpt was read again to the jurors in response to their question. </p>
<p>[48] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in failing to make clear 
  that, if the jury was in doubt as to which of the two accused shot Thomas and 
  they were not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was planned 
  and deliberate, neither accused could be convicted of first degree murder under 
  s. 231(5)(e).</p>
<p>[49] The appellant&#146;s argument is based on the assertion that there was 
  no evidence that would have supported an inference that the appellant, although 
  a party to Thomas&#146; forcible seizure, had been &#147;a substantial and integral 
  cause&#148; of Thomas&#146; death within the meaning ascribed to that phrase 
  in R. v. Harbottle (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). I disagree.</p>
<p>[50] In Harbottle, the appellant was found guilty of first degree murder for 
  his role in the victim&#146;s death. He held the deceased&#146;s legs so that 
  she could not defend herself while the co-accused strangled her. Justice Cory, 
  writing for the court, established the substantial causation test under s. 214(5) 
  [now s. 231(5)], in these words (at p. 13): </p>
<p class="indent">In my view, an accused may only be convicted under the subsection 
  if the Crown establishes that the accused has committed an act or series of 
  acts which are of such a nature that they must be regarded as a substantial 
  and integral cause of death.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">The substantial causation test requires that the accused play 
  a very active role &#150; usually a physical one &#150; in the killing. Under 
  s. 214(5), the actions of the accused must form an essential, substantial and 
  integral part of the killing of the victim.</p>
<p>[51] At p. 14, Cory J. gave two examples of other situations where a person 
  might be held to have played a substantial and integral part in a murder despite 
  not actually having caused the victim&#146;s death. First, &#147;if one accused 
  with intent to kill locked the victim in a cupboard while the other set fire 
  to that cupboard, then the accused who confined the victim might be found to 
  have caused the death of the victim pursuant to s. 214(5) [now s. 231(5)]&#148;. 
  Second, &#147;an accused who fought off rescuers in order to allow his accomplice 
  to complete the strangulation of the victim might also be found to have been 
  a substantial cause of the death.&#148;</p>
<p>[52] On the facts of this case, the jury was entitled to conclude that the 
  appellant was a substantial and integral cause of Thomas&#146; death. Thomas&#146; 
  body was found in a clump of trees approximately fifteen to twenty feet inside 
  a fenced area at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station. The six foot high 
  fence was made of chainlink and topped with barbed wire. The undergrowth at 
  the time of death would have been dense. Had there only been one assailant, 
  whether Thomas was forced to climb over the fence or crawl through the nearby 
  gap in the fence caused by a drain way, he would have been in a position to 
  run away when the assailant climbed the fence or crawled through the drain way. 
  The jury was entitled to conclude that it took both the shooter and the non-shooter 
  to get Thomas to the execution site.</p>
<p>[53] In my view, the facts in this case are similar both to the very facts 
  in Harbottle itself and to those posited in the second example. All of the evidence 
  of the events of the day supports the inference that the appellant acted in 
  concert with his co-perpetrator throughout the day. Thomas&#146; robbery and 
  murder was a joint venture. It took both the appellant and the co-accused to 
  forcibly escort Thomas to his execution site. Assuming that Thomas was shot 
  by a single person and that the appellant was the non-shooter, the appellant 
  prevented Thomas&#146; escape. As such, he committed an act or series of acts 
  of such a nature that they could be regarded as a substantial and integral cause 
  of death. The appellant &#147;caused&#148; Thomas&#146; death because he participated 
  in the murder in such a manner that he was the substantial cause of Thomas&#146; 
  death. His role was as substantial as that of the accused in Harbottle itself. 
  The &#147;back up&#148; role that the appellant played was as integral to Thomas&#146; 
  death as that of the shooter.</p>
<p>[54] In the circumstances, it was open to the trial judge to instruct the jury 
  in the manner that he did. There was ample evidence upon which the jury could 
  have found the accused guilty of first degree murder on the basis that Thomas&#146; 
  murder was planned and deliberate. If the jury was not convinced beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that there was planning and deliberation and they found that the co-accused 
  shot Thomas, they had to find that the appellant played a substantial and integral 
  role in Thomas&#146; death. If unable to determine which of the two men shot 
  Thomas, they had to find that both accused played a substantial and integral 
  cause in Thomas&#146; death in order to find them guilty under s. 231(5). In 
  the instant case, it was entirely open to the jury to conclude that both the 
  shooter and the non-shooter played a substantial and integral role in Thomas&#146; 
  murder. I would, therefore, reject this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>DISPOSITION</p>
<p>[55] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
