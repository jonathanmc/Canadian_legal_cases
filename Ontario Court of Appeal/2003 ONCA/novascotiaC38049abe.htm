<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] In the circumstances, given the conduct of the appellant on the day of 
  the motion, it was within the motion judge's discretion to proceed as she did. 
  We see no evidence of bias or apparent bias and we are satisfied that the appellant 
  received a fair hearing.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] With respect to the merits, we agree with the motions judge that there 
  is no genuine issue for trial. The respondent Bank did not take possession of 
  the property and was free to enforce its security to collect the debt owing 
  in accordance with the contractual arrangements between the parties. To the 
  extent that there was any duty on the Bank, in these circumstances, to act in 
  a commercially reasonable fashion, we are satisfied that it did so. Accordingly, 
  the appeal is dismissed. Costs to the respondent on a partial indemnity basis 
  fixed at $7,500 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
