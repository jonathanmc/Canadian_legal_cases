<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in the manner that he addressed 
  the credibility of the complainant. Nor do we think that the trial judge erred 
  in the use to which he made of the complainant's conversation with Bradley. 
  The appellant did not press the third ground of appeal relating to the seizure 
  of the gun. He points out that we need not resolve that matter to sustain the 
  convictions.</p>
<p>[2] Even if the trial judge used the appellant's lack of remorse as an aggravating 
  factor, we are satisfied that the sentence imposed was fit.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal 
  sentence is granted and the appeal is dismissed.</p>
