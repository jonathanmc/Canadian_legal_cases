<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice J. J. Douglas of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice on June 17, 2002.</p>
<p>CRONK J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant, Earl O'Hagan, applies for leave to appeal and, if leave 
  be granted, appeals against his sentence of 18 months imprisonment on his conviction 
  for one count of possession of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(4) of 
  the Criminal Code, and 6 months imprisonment, concurrent, on his conviction 
  for one count of breach of probation contrary to s. 733.1 of the Criminal Code, 
  followed by 3 years probation.</p><p>
  [2] In support of his appeal, the appellant argues that:</p>
<p class="indent"> (1) the trial judge misapprehended the Crown's submissions 
  at trial concerning sentence in connection with the possession of child pornography 
  conviction and, in doing so, failed to respect a negotiated joint submission, 
  despite his stated intention to the contrary;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) the trial judge erred by imposing a sentence designed 
  to punish the appellant for past lenient sentences concerning other crimes; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">(3) the Crown's inadvertent late disclosure of a psychiatric 
  report authored by Dr. R. W. Hill in May 1998, which was not disclosed to the 
  defence until the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, resulted in an unfair 
  hearing. The appellant submits that the report should be admitted as fresh evidence, 
  and considered by this court on this appeal.</p>
<p><strong>(1) Misapprehension of the Crown's Sentencing Submissions and the Alleged 
  Joint Sentencing Submission</strong></p>
<p>[3] At trial, Crown counsel sought a custodial term of 12 to 18 months in connection 
  with the appellant's conviction for possession of child pornography, with appropriate 
  weight to be given to pre-trial custody, together with probation for 3 years. 
  Defence counsel argued that the appellant should receive 9 months credit for 
  138 days of pre-trial custody, together with an additional 4 months of imprisonment, 
  followed by probation. </p><p>
  [4] In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge stated:</p>
<p class="indent"> I have before me, in essence, a joint submission as 
  to the appropriate range, as it were, or nearly. The Crown proposes a sentence 
  of 12 to 18 months in addition to time served. The defence say the appropriate 
  range is in the area of 9 to 12 months, but less time served.</p>
<p class="indent">While I intend to abide by what I see to be a joint 
  submission in all of these circumstances, that is with respect to the nature 
  of the form of incarceration, my own reasoning would suggest an increased period 
  of time and it leads me to adopt, here, the outside range of the Crown's submissions 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[5] The Crown argues that there was no joint submission at trial concerning 
  the appropriate range of a custodial sentence. We agree. While both counsel 
  appear to have agreed that the upper end of the appropriate range of incarceration 
  should be less than 2 years, their positions as to an overall appropriate range 
  or duration of sentence were divergent. The sentence imposed by the trial judge, 
  while at the highest end of the range proposed by the Crown at trial, was less 
  than 2 years imprisonment, thus permitting imposition of a term of probation. 
  In arriving at that sentence, the trial judge recognized that the agreement 
  of counsel related only to the nature of the form of incarceration, namely, 
  incarceration in a reformatory setting. That required a custodial term of less 
  than 2 years. The trial judge accepted that proposal.</p><p>
  [6] On this appeal, the Crown concedes that the trial judge misstated the trial 
  Crown's position regarding credit for pre-trial detention when he said that 
  the Crown's proposal was a sentence of 12 to 18 months &quot;in addition to 
  time served&quot;. The Crown's proposal contemplated 12 to 18 months incarceration 
  before any credit for time served. Notwithstanding that misstatement, the Crown 
  argues that the sentence imposed was fit, having regard to the nature of the 
  offence and the circumstances of this offender. We agree.</p><p>
  [7] Possession of child pornography is a crime of enormous gravity, both for 
  the affected victims and for society as a whole. For that reason, the courts 
  have repeatedly recognized that the most important sentencing principles in 
  cases involving child pornography are general deterrence and denunciation. Further, 
  the offence of possession of child pornography requires the imposition of sentences 
  which denounce the morally reprehensible nature of the crime, deters others 
  from the commission of the offence, and reflects the gravity of the offence: 
  see R. v. Sharpe (2001), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Stroempl (1995), 
  105 C.C.C. (3d) 187 (Ont. C.A.). In this case, as observed by the trial judge 
  and as discussed later in these reasons, the record of the appellant disclosed 
  actual abuse of children. His accumulation of violent pornographic material 
  involving young children, and the timing of his access to such material, support 
  the trial judge's conclusion that the appellant poses a danger to the community. 
  For those reasons, we conclude that the appellant's sentence is entirely fit.</p><p>
  [8] The appellant asserts that the trial judge intended to credit 138 days of 
  pre-trial custody but, in error, allowed a credit for only 106 days. The Crown 
  submits that the trial judge, in fact, credited the appellant with 138 days 
  of pre-trial custody, on a two-for-one basis. </p><p>
  [9] We conclude, on a careful reading of the trial judge's reasons for sentence, 
  that he credited the appellant with 138 days of pre-trial custody, on a two-for-one 
  basis.</p><p>
  [10] The trial judge indicated that, in his view, the appropriate starting point 
  for a fit sentence was in the range of 3 years. He then stated:</p>
<p class="indent"> From three years, if one took the approximately 138 
  days of pre-trial custody as the equivalent to about four and a half months 
  and awarded that on the usual two-for-one basis, &#133; that would be the equivalent 
  of about nine and some months, which would reduce that disposition to something 
  in the range of 27 months.</p>
<p>[11] The appellant had been placed while in pre-trial custody in a &quot;lock 
  down&quot; situation, which segregated him from the general inmate population 
  and reduced his time out of his cell to approximately one or two hours a day. 
  The trial judge recognized that consideration of that aggravating factor would 
  further reduce the sentence. Finally, the trial judge considered the desirability 
  of imposing a term of probation, which required imposition of a sentence of 
  imprisonment of 2 years or less in duration. In the result, the trial judge 
  reduced the 27 month sentence to an 18 month sentence of imprisonment, followed 
  by 3 years probation. The trial judge's stated approach to arriving at that 
  sentence indicates that he clearly credited the appellant with 138 days of pre-trial 
  custody, on a two-for-one basis. </p>
<p><strong>(2) Consideration by the Trial Judge of Past Sentences </strong></p>
<p>[12] In May 1992, the appellant was found guilty of having forced his 3-1/2 
  year-old daughter to fellate him. He was also found guilty of having forced 
  his 4 year-old niece to fellate him. In respect of those offences, he was sentenced 
  to a custodial term of 4-1/2 months, concurrent, followed by 3 years probation. 
  Approximately 6 years later, in May 1998, the appellant, while impaired, broke 
  into his sister's residence and abducted his 9 year-old niece. After he was 
  apprehended, the appellant was convicted of the offences of abduction and impaired 
  driving. He received a 90 day intermittent sentence in addition to 14 days time 
  served, followed by 3 years probation. While serving that term of probation, 
  he purchased the pornographic images at issue in this case. </p><p>
  [13] In commenting on the 4-1/2 month concurrent custodial sentence received 
  by the appellant in 1992 upon his conviction for the 2 counts of sexual interference 
  involving his daughter and one of his nieces, the trial judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> Why such a disposition was imposed in that case is 
  lost in the murk of time I suppose.</p>
<p>[14] He later observed:</p>
<p class="indent"> In my view, the accused has not served a significant 
  period of time for whatever reasons were operative on an earlier occasion. That 
  was, perhaps, looking back and retrospectively, which is always dangerous, a 
  mistake. The community ought to have been better protected from this gentleman 
  than it has been in the past. However, that brings into play what is loosely 
  called the jump principle, that sentences ought not to significantly go from 
  low amounts to high amounts. One must, of course, consider the totality of the 
  sentence and one must, in the end, consider the nature of sentences being given 
  by such as the Court of Appeal in Ontario and senior courts throughout the province.</p>
<p>[15] The appellant submits that those statements by the trial judge indicate 
  that he sought to punish the appellant for what he perceived to be lenient sentences 
  imposed in connection with past offences. We do not accept that submission. 
  The full context of the trial judge's comments make clear that his references 
  to sentences previously received by the appellant were directed to consideration 
  of the &quot;jump principle&quot;, whereby sentences for a repeat offender should 
  increase gradually, rather than by large leaps. The reasons for sentence of 
  the trial judge, in our view, do not demonstrate that he erred in analysis of 
  that principle, or that he attached any improper significance to the sentences 
  received by the appellant for past offences.</p>
<p> <strong>(3) The Proposed Fresh Evidence</strong></p>
<p>[16] The appellant argues that Dr. Hill's report of May 1998 undermines the 
  trial judge's finding that the appellant &quot;remains a persistent danger&quot; 
  to the community, and that the Crown's late disclosure of the report, although 
  inadvertent, prejudiced the appellant at his sentencing hearing. The Crown opposes 
  admission of the report as fresh evidence on this appeal, on the basis that 
  the appellant has not satisfied the pre-conditions for admissibility of fresh 
  evidence set out in R. v. Palmer and Palmer (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (S.C.C.). 
  In particular, the Crown argues that the appellant has not met the due diligence 
  and relevance pre-conditions for admissibility of the report. </p><p>
  [17] While the due diligence requirement for the admission of fresh evidence 
  may be less stringently applied in criminal, as opposed to civil, cases, it 
  is significant that the report in question was generated for and with the participation 
  of the appellant, and that a copy of the report was filed as an exhibit at his 
  sentencing hearing in connection with his conviction for abduction in 1998. 
  The report, therefore, was a public court document, the existence of which was 
  known to the appellant. </p><p>
  [18] Nonetheless, we have reviewed the contents of Dr. Hill's report. In our 
  view, the report is not relevant to the determination of a fit sentence for 
  the present offence. The report was prepared in 1998, approximately 4 years 
  before the appellant's sentencing hearing in this case. Accordingly, it does 
  not concern, and does not take into account, the offence now at issue, which 
  had not been committed by the appellant when the report was authored. In addition, 
  the report does not take detailed account of the appellant's past criminal convictions 
  for the sexual abuse of his daughter and his niece. Finally, as asserted by 
  the Crown before us, the fact that the author of the report concluded, shortly 
  before the appellant committed the offence now at issue, that the appellant 
  was not a dangerous risk diminishes the value of the report in assessing the 
  future dangerousness of the appellant. For all of those reasons, it cannot reasonably 
  be expected that the report would have affected the result at the appellant's 
  sentencing hearing.</p>
<p> <strong>(4) Disposition</strong></p>
<p>
  [19] Accordingly, for the reasons given, leave to appeal sentence is granted 
  and the sentence appeal is dismissed. In accordance with the order of Catzman 
  J.A. of this court dated October 31, 2002, Crown counsel is directed to collect 
  and destroy the supplementary appeal books filed with this court.</p>
