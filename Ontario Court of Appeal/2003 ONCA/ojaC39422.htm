<p>On appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court (Justice John G.J. O'Driscoll,
  Justice Edward F. Then and Justice Tamarin M. Dunnet) dated February 15, 2002,
  reported at (2002) 58 O.R. (3d) 186.</p> 
<p> MACPHERSON J.A.: </p> 
<p> <strong>A. INTRODUCTION</strong></p> 
<p> [1] In two landmark decisions, the Supreme Court of Canada addressed the
  relationship between judicial compensation and the constitutional principle
  of judicial independence.</p> 
<p> [2] In <em>Beauregard v. Canada</em>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 56 ("<em>Beauregard</em>"),
  the court defined judicial independence in individual and institutional terms
  and applied the definition in the context of judicial pensions. </p> 
<p> [3] In the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>,<a name="r1"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> 
  [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3, the court dealt comprehensively with <em>the process</em> 
  by which judicial compensation is set. In order to ensure actual and perceived 
  judicial independence, the court held that the compensation of judges cannot 
  be the subject of unilateral decision-making by governments, nor can it be the 
  subject of direct negotiations between the judiciary and governments. Rather, 
  judicial compensation must be determined through an independent commission process. 
  Once a commission has conducted hearings and made its report, the government 
  must consider that report. The government is not bound to accept the commission's 
  recommendations; however, the recommendations "should not be set aside lightly" 
  (p. 88). Moreover, if a government chooses not to accept a commission's recommendations, 
  it must be prepared to justify its decision, "if need be, in a court of law" 
  (p. 88). The standard of justification is "simple rationality [which] requires 
  that the government articulate a legitimate reason for why it has chosen to 
  depart from the recommendation of the commission" (p. 110).</p> 
<p> [4] The present appeal requires careful consideration and application of
  the principles of <em>Beauregard</em> and the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em> in
  the context of the decision of Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province
  of Ontario, as represented by the Chair of the Management Board ("the
  Government") in 2000 not to accept the recommendations of an independent
  commission relating to pensions for judges of the Ontario provincial courts.<a name="r2"></a><a href="#2">[2]</a> The
  Government provided reasonably detailed reasons for rejecting the commission's
  recommendations. The principal issue on appeal is whether those reasons met
  the 'simple rationality' standard set out in the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>.</p> 
<p> <strong>B. FACTS</strong></p> 
<p class="indent"><strong> (1) The parties and the events</strong></p> 
<p> [5] The appellants, the Ontario Judges' Association, the Ontario Family Law
  Judges' Association and the Provincial Court (Civil Division) Judges' Association,
  are the three judges' associations which represented the justices of the Ontario
  Court of Justice before the Fourth Triennial Provincial Judges' Remuneration
  Commission ("the Commission").</p> 
<p> [6] The Commission was constituted pursuant to the <em>Courts of Justice
    Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. 43, s. 51.13, and the Framework Agreement, attached
    as a schedule to that statute. The Framework Agreement governs the jurisdiction
    and terms of reference of each triennial commission. The Commission's recommendations
    relating to judicial salaries, benefits and allowances are binding on the
    Government. In contrast, the Commission's recommendations relating to judicial
    pensions are not binding.</p> 
<p> [7] The Fourth Triennial Commission was convened to make recommendations
  relating to judicial compensation for the 1998-2000 period. The terms of reference
  of the Commission were set out in s. 25 of the Framework Agreement: </p> 
<p class="indent"> The parties agree that the Commission in making its recommendations
  on provincial judges' compensation shall give every consideration to, but not
  limited to, the following criteria&#133;</p> 
<p class="indent15">(a) the laws of Ontario,</p> 
<p class="indent15">(b) the need to provide fair and reasonable compensation
  for judges in light of prevailing economic conditions in the province and the
  overall state of the provincial economy,</p> 
<p class="indent15">(c) the growth or decline in real per capita income,</p> 
<p class="indent15">(d) the parameters set by any joint working committees established
  by the parties,</p> 
<p class="indent15">(e) that the Governments may not reduce the salaries, pensions
  or benefits of Judges, individually or collectively, without infringing the
  principle of judicial independence,</p> 
<p class="indent15">(f) any other factor which it considers relevant to the matters
  in issue.</p> 
<p> [8] The Commission was chaired by Stanley M. Beck, Q.C. The judges' nominee
  on the Commission was John C. Murray; the Government's nominee was Valerie
  A. Gibbons. The Commission conducted hearings and received several written
  submissions from the judges' associations and the Government in late 1998 and
  early 1999.</p> 
<p> [9] On May 20, 1999, the Commission released its report. On the question
  of salary, the majority (Beck and Murray) recommended a staged increase from
  the then base salary of $130,810 to $150,000 in 1998, $160,000 in 1999, and
  $170,000 in 2000. This represented a 28 per cent salary increase and, according
  to the Commission, would have cost the Government approximately $10,000,000
  over the three year period. By virtue of the Framework Agreement, this recommendation
  was binding on the Government and was implemented.</p> 
<p> [10] The majority of the Commission also recommended significant improvements
  to the judges' pension scheme. At the time, the judges were entitled to a base
  pension of 45 per cent of salary at 65 years of age and after 15 years of service.
  A judge would also receive an additional 1 per cent for each year of service
  above 15 before age 65 and a further 1 per cent for each year of service after
  age 65. Thus, for example, a judge who was appointed to the provincial court
  at age 45 and retired at age 70 would be entitled to a pension of 55 per cent
  of his final salary (45 base plus 5 pre-65 service plus 5 post-65 service).</p> 
<p> [11] The pension for federally appointed judges in 1998 was 66&#8532; per cent
  of salary at age 65 and after 15 years of service. The majority of the Commission
  was of the view that the pension scheme for provincial court judges should
  be equal, or at least closer, to the federal scheme. The Commission said: </p> 
<p class="indent"> The goal of doing away with a hierarchy of courts in Ontario,
  and attracting the same high quality of practitioner to the bench, regardless
  of the court, will not be attainable without a substantial revision to the
  pension plan. The mandatory implementation of our salary recommendations, without
  implementation of our pension recommendations, would not be sensible social
  policy.</p> 
<p> [12] The Commission recommended that the Government improve the pension scheme
  for provincial judges in one of three ways: (1) duplicate the federal scheme;
  (2) adopt a 20 year accrual rate of 3.3 per cent, which would provide a judge
  with a pension of 66&#8532; per cent of salary at age 65 after 20 years of
  service; or (3) provide an across-the-board increase of 10 per cent, making
  the base pension 55 per cent (the Commission stressed that this third option
  was "not nearly as desirable as options 1 or 2").</p> 
<p> [13] The majority of the Commission also recommended a retirement Rule of
  80 for provincial judges, similar to the plan for federally appointed judges.
  The Rule of 80 permits retirement before age 65 without penalty if a judge's
  age and years of service, added together, equal 80.</p> 
<p> [14] Finally, the majority of the Commission commented on the penalties applicable
  to provincial judges who retired early. The penalties were a reduction in pension
  of 5 per cent for every year between ages 60 and 64 that a judge took early
  retirement and an additional reduction of 2 per cent for every year between
  ages 55 and 59. The Commission recommended that these penalties be eliminated
  or, in the alternative, reversed.</p> 
<p> [15] The minority of the Commission (Gibbons) stated that the majority's
  award was not supportable. After acknowledging more buoyant economic conditions
  generally, the minority observed that an environment of economic restraint
  continued to exist, resulting in public sector wage settlements that averaged
  0.3 per cent in 1997 and 1.5 per cent by the end of the third quarter in 1998.
  As well, the minority found that there was no evidence that the existing salary
  levels had resulted in a diminution of the quality of provincial judges in
  the province. The minority did not support enhancements to the judges' pension
  plan. Ms. Gibbons was of the view that any concerns about the adequacy of the
  pension should be reviewed in a manner similar to the approach taken by the
  Second Triennial Commission (i.e. the appointment of an actuarial team to study
  the matter).</p> 
<p> [16] Following receipt of the Commission's report, the Government began to
  consider it. Pursuant to the Framework Agreement, the Commission's recommendations
  relating to salary, benefits and allowances were binding and the Government
  implemented them.</p> 
<p> [17] The Commission's recommendations relating to pensions and related matters
  (the Rule of 80 and penalties for early retirement) were not binding. The <em>P.E.I.
  Reference</em> required the Government to respond to them.</p> 
<p> [18] The Government decided to engage PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC")
  to review the Commission's pension recommendations. The contract between the
  Government and PwC provided: </p> 
<p class="indent"> <strong>Background and scope:</strong> </p> 
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>The Provincial Judges Remuneration Commission ("the Commission") is 
        established under the Framework Agreement between the government and the 
        Judges. The agreement is incorporated into the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em> 
        as a schedule. The Commission's mandate is to review and make recommendations 
        to the government concerning judicial compensation, on a triennial basis. 
        The Commission reports to the Chair of Management Board of Cabinet.</li>
      <li>The Commission's salary and benefit recommendations are binding on the 
        government, while pension recommendations must be given the "greatest 
        consideration".</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul> 
<p class="indent"> <strong>Purpose of Project</strong></p> 
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>The 1998 Commission recommended a number of different pension options. 
        The objective is to examine the Commission's pension recommendations. 
        Management Board Secretariat is required to present the Commission's pension 
        recommendations to MBC. It is the intention to do so before the end of 
        the year.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul> 
<p class="indent"> <strong>Required Services</strong></p>
<ol>
  <ol>
    <ol>
      <li> Examine the Commission's pension recommendations.</li>
      <li> Endorse or reject those recommendations, in part or in whole.</li>
      <li>Propose other options that would meet the Commission's objectives.</li>
      <li>Cost the Commission's pension options and the sensitivity of these costs 
        to the assumptions employed in developing them.</li>
      <li>Advise as to any implications associated with the Framework Agreement 
        (between the government and the judges) with respect to: 
        <ul>
          <li> the principle of judicial independence.</li>
          <li>the competitiveness of the current Ontario pension compensation 
            package as compared to that in other jurisdictions, and its adequacy 
            in attracting qualified candidates to the Ontario bench. [The report 
            will test the Commission's assertion that the Ontario compensation 
            package is competitively inferior compared to other jurisdictions, 
            particularly the federal arrangements.]</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p> PwC provided advice to the Government pursuant to this contract.</p> 
<p> [19] In a letter to the Chair of the Commission dated February 1, 2000, the
  Government, speaking through the Honourable Chris Hodgson, Chair of the Management
  Board of Cabinet, indicated that it "has decided not to implement any
  of the recommendations of the Commission concerning pensions for the following
  reasons": </p> 
<ol>
  <li>  The current pension entitlements are appropriate and their
    value has already increased as a result of salary increases awarded by the
    Commission. The salary increase awarded by the Commission increased the value
    of a judge's pension benefit by approximately 28%.</li>
  <li>Ontario judges' pensions
      will not erode over time, because they are automatically protected by the
      fact that the benefit formula is based on the final salary at retirement
      and indexed thereafter. Ontario's retired judges' pensions increase at
    the actual rate of increases in active judges' salaries. Retired judges'
    pensions have increased as a result of the Commission's salary increase award.</li>
  <li> Increases to Ontario judges' salaries have significantly narrowed the
    gap with federal judges. Although there is not parity, the Commission did
  not endorse parity.</li>
  <li> In 1991, actuaries, representing the Judges, the Government
    and the Second Triennial Commission, reviewed the judges' pension plan. The
    actuaries noted a demographic shift toward a younger age of appointment,
    which was apparent then. Based on the design options presented by the actuaries,
    the Commission recommended and the Government accepted some significant changes.
    Since 1991, no other significant demographic changes have occurred.</li>
  <li> A 75%
      replacement ratio (of retirement income to final salary) is achievable
    under the current pension arrangement when one considers the likely pre-appointment
  savings of judges.</li>
  <li> For a typical judge, the value of the pension provided
      by the Ontario judges' pension plan is not only comparable, but is superior
      to the pension provided to provincial judges in all other provinces and
    territories. For a typical judge, the value of the Ontario judges' pension
  is approximately 4.75% higher than the next closest province or territory.</li>
  <li> The Commission's recommendations concerning pensions are not appropriate
      under the Government's continued fiscal restraint. Management Board cannot
      look at an issue in isolation, but must view it within the framework of
    balancing competing interests for the Government's limited resources. In
    balancing competing interests, it attempts to maximize social utility, considering
      that the taxpayers of Ontario will bear the costs. Government must continue
    to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent more effectively and efficiently
    as it moves toward a balanced budget. The Government's announcement of $300
    million in expenditure reductions on November 18, 1999 is evidence of the
    Government's continued commitment to fiscal restraint to strengthen the Ontario
    economy. </li>
</ol>
<p class="indent"><strong> (2) The litigation</strong></p> 
<p> [20] On August 10, 2000, the three judges' associations commenced an application
  for judicial review in the Divisional Court. They sought an order quashing
  and setting aside the Government's decision and an order directing the Government
  to implement the Commission's recommendations relating to judges' pensions.</p> 
<p> [21] In support of their application, the judges' associations filed an affidavit
  by Vanessa Payne, a lawyer at Sack Goldblatt Mitchell, the firm representing
  them, attaching excerpts from the parties' submissions before the Commission,
  the Commission's report and the Government's response.</p> 
<p> [22] The Government filed an affidavit by Owen M. O'Neil, the current senior
  team leader at PwC on the judges' pension file, detailing PwC's work for the
  Government. One of the components of the affidavit was a description of PwC's
  inability to confirm the costing calculations relating to judges' pensions
  performed by Watson Wyatt, a firm retained by the judges' associations whose
  report had been submitted to the Commission. O'Neil's affidavit also set out
  conversations and correspondence with Watson Wyatt which did not produce satisfactory
  responses from PwC's perspective.</p> 
<p> [23] The judges' associations then filed two affidavits by Justice R. Lloyd
  Budgell dealing with the Watson Wyatt report and communications between Watson
  Wyatt and PwC. </p> 
<p> [24] The Government countered with a final brief affidavit from O'Neil on
  the same topics.</p> 
<p> [25] Before the Divisional Court (O'Driscoll, Then and Dunnet JJ.), the judges' 
  associations advanced three arguments: (1) the Government's retainer of PwC 
  to provide advice after the Commission delivered its report was a violation 
  of the process set out in the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em> and the Framework Agreement; 
  (2) the two O'Neil affidavits were inadmissible in the judicial review proceedings; 
  and (3) the Government's rejection of the Commission's recommendations relating 
  to pensions was unconstitutional because it was not a rational response within 
  the parameters of the Supreme Court of Canada's analysis in the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>.</p> 
<p> [26] The Divisional Court rejected the judges' associations' submissions
  and dismissed the application for judicial review.</p> 
<p> [27] On the PwC retainer issue, the Divisional Court said: </p> 
<p class="indent"> We do not accept the submission of . . . the Association,
  that it was "outrageous conduct" for the Government of Ontario to
  retain PwC, independent actuaries, in order to find out "what would this
  cost". Indeed, we see it as an essential, prudent decision that enabled
  the Government of Ontario to make an informed response to the Commission's
  pension proposals.</p> 
<p> [28] With respect to the admissibility of the O'Neil affidavits, the court
  said: </p> 
<p class="indent"> [T]he Government of Ontario is entitled to put before the
  Court the advice given when called upon to "justify its decision in a
  court of law". Because the advice regarding pensions would only be sought
  and provided after the Government of Ontario had been advised of the Commission's
  recommendations, excluding extraordinary circumstances, the only avenue open
  to the Government of Ontario to justify its decision was to file affidavit
  evidence in order to place before the Court what advice was sought and what
  advice was received. The preparation and filing by the Government of Ontario
  of the disputed affidavits were actions that arose out of necessity.</p> 
<p> [29] On the principal issue in the judicial review application, namely, whether
  the Government's reasons for not accepting the Commission's recommendations
  relating to judges' pensions complied with the 'simple rationality' test set
  out in the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>, the court concluded: </p> 
<p class="indent"> Applying the "simple rationality" test to the Government
  of Ontario's seven-part response, dated February 1, 2000 (<em>supra</em>),
  in our view, the Government of Ontario has met the test set out under each
  heading. There is no evidence that the decision was purely political, discriminatory
  or lacked a rational basis. The process (the Commission) used to determine
  the pension benefits exceeded judicial independence requirements.</p> 
<p class="indent">The actions of the Government of Ontario in retaining PWC actuaries
  to cost out the Commission's recommendations demonstrate that the Government
  of Ontario gave serious concern to the Commission's recommendations.</p> 
<p class="indent">We agree with the submissions of its counsel that the Government
  of Ontario's written decision meets the standard of simple rationality. The
  reasons are clear, logical, relevant and consistent with the Government's position
  taken before the Commission.</p> 
<p class="indent">There is no evidence that the judges of the Ontario Court of
  Justice are anything but qualified. There is no evidence that the Government
  of Ontario has been unable to attract the ablest of candidates because of the
  amount, structure or features of the Association's pension plan.</p> 
<p> [30] The judges' associations appeal from the judgment of the Divisional
  Court.</p> 
<p class="bold"> C. ISSUES</p> 
<p> [31] The issues on the appeal are: </p> 
<p class="indent"> (1) Did the Divisional Court err by concluding that the Government's
  engagement of PwC after the Commission delivered its report was constitutional
  and complied with the Framework Agreement?</p> 
<p class="indent">(2) Did the Divisional Court err by admitting the two O'Neil
  affidavits tendered by the Government in the judicial review proceedings?</p> 
<p class="indent">(3) Did the Divisional Court err by concluding that the Government's
  reasons for not accepting the Commission's recommendations relating to judges'
  pensions met the 'simple rationality' test from the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>?</p> 
<p class="indent">(4) If the answer to any of (1) - (3) is 'Yes', what is the
  appropriate remedy?</p> 
<p class="bold"> D. ANALYSIS</p> 
<p class="indent"> <strong>(1) The Government's engagement of PwC </strong></p> 
<p> [32] The appellants contend that the manner in which the Government considered
  and dealt with the Commission's report and recommendations contravened both
  the constitutional process set out in the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em> and the
  provisions of the Framework Agreement. The focal point of this submission is
  the Government's decision to retain PwC to provide actuarial services and advice
  with respect to the Commission's </p> 
<p> pension recommendations. The appellants label this component of the Government's
  decision-making process "secretive, <em>ex post facto</em> and unauthorized".
  They contend that it was entirely inconsistent with the constitutional requirement
  that the commission process established in the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em> be
  an <em>effective</em> process. They also submit that it contravened the special
  process the parties established in the Framework Agreement.</p> 
<p class="indent15"> <strong>(a) The constitutional process argument</strong></p> 
<p> [33] The appellants contend that the constitutional imperative that the commission
  process be effective requires the Government to put all of the information
  and arguments which support its position before the Commission. The Government
  should not be permitted 'to lie in the weeds' at the commission stage of the
  process only to bring forward the bases on which it rejects commission recommendations
  for the first time as part of its response to the Commission's report. To do
  so would prevent the judges or the Commission from answering the Government's
  final position, thereby rendering the commission process ineffective and unconstitutional.</p> 
<p> [34] What would render a commission process ineffective will, of course,
  depend on the circumstances of each case. I do not think that this is an area
  in which there can be absolute rules. However, I agree with the appellants
  that, as a general rule, the Government as a party to the commission process
  should put its best foot forward; it should be open and forthcoming about the
  positions that it takes and the information upon which it relies. The Government
  should not hold back for tactical reasons. The Commission should have the benefit
  of (1) all of the relevant information that is available and (2) all of the
  arguments that the parties wish to make. In that way, the Commission has the
  opportunity to consider the competing positions of the parties in a comprehensive
  manner. Such consideration of the parties' positions will produce well-founded
  commission recommendations. </p> 
<p> [35] That said, I do not agree with the appellants that in this case the
  fact that the Government commissioned the PwC Report after the release of the
  Commission's report, and to some extent relied on its contents in rejecting
  the Commission's recommendations, rendered the commission process ineffective.
  It is important to consider how the process in this case actually unfolded
  and why it was necessary for the Government to retain PwC in order to respond
  to the Commission's report in an informed and intelligent manner.</p> 
<p> [36] The judges' associations provided a brief on the subject of 'pension
  costings' to the Commission. The brief was based on the calculations of an
  actuarial firm, Watson Wyatt. These calculations related to three models of
  pension reform proposed by the judges - the 66&#8532; per cent scheme for federal
  judges, the 20 year 3.3 per cent accrual rate scheme, and the 10 per cent across-the-board
  increase scheme. Importantly, the Watson Wyatt calculations for these models
  used as a base the current salary for the judges, $130,810. None of the calculations
  done by Watson Wyatt used as a base the new salary sought by the judges, $175,305
  (the current salary for federally approved judges), or indeed any other number
  above their current salary.</p> 
<p> [37] The Government's position before the Commission was that the existing
  pension plan had been established in 1992 and that there was no need to revise
  it for the 1998-2000 period: </p> 
<p class="indent"> The design and level of benefits in the Judges' pension plan
  were considered in detail by the 1991 Commission. A joint actuarial group was
  formed consisting of actuaries from each of the two parties, the Judges and
  the Government, plus the Commission. The mandate of the group was to review
  the plan and requirements, and present reasonable alternatives which it did
  in the form of two reports which became part of the Commission's 1992 Report.</p> 
<p class="indent">The result of this joint process was the development of a jointly-agreed
  upon rationale and basis for the re-design of the pension plan. The enhancements
  took into consideration the trend towards younger appointments and provided
  for a recognition of benefits based on service. The two joint actuarial reports
  became the basis for the Commission's recommendation to significantly enhance
  the existing plan. As stated directly in the previous Commission's report, "Given
  that actuaries for the two parties as well as the Commission participated in
  the development of the rationale for the present recommendation, we are satisfied
  that it is a sound one that should be implemented".</p> 
<p class="indent">The Government accepted the Commission's recommendation and
  implemented the new redesigned plan.</p> 
<p class="center">. . . . .</p> 
<p class="indent">Since 1992, there have been no significant changes in the demographics
  of Judges which would necessitate a further enhancement in the pension plan
  at this time.</p> 
<p class="center">. . . . .</p> 
<p class="indent">Overall, therefore, the Government believes that a change to
  the pension plan is not warranted at this time.</p> 
<p> [38] The Commission recommended that the Government implement one of the
  three pension reforms proposed by the judges. It provided cost calculations
  for all three models. However, unlike its analysis with respect to salaries,
  where the Commission stated the costs of the proposed three-stage increase
  ("somewhat over $10,000,000"), the Commission's cost calculations
  with respect to pensions were limited to the current salary of the judges.</p> 
<p> [39] The implication of the above description is obvious: no one - not the
  judges, the Government nor the Commission - analyzed how much money was involved
  in any of the three pension models proposed by the Commission when linked with
  the judges' new salaries.</p> 
<p> [40] I do not blame anyone for this omission. The judges' associations provided
  some cost calculations, but linked only to their current salary, not to the
  new salary they were seeking. The Government performed no calculation, presumably
  because it opposed further enhancement of the pension scheme. Finally, the
  Commission did not conduct a cost analysis of its pension recommendations,
  presumably because it was recommending three possible reform models and assumed
  the Government would perform the calculation as part of its assessment of those
  models. Each of the parties and the Commission could be criticized for this
  omission. I prefer to say that while all three made their best efforts on this
  topic, those efforts left an obvious question: what would the implementation
  of the Commission's pension models cost? In this context, it was entirely proper
  for the Government to engage PwC to provide advice about the pension reform
  models proposed by the Commission.</p> 
<p> [41] In <em>Beauregard</em>, at p. 76, Dickson C.J.C. observed that "[t]he
  starting point&#133;is recognition that someone must provide for judicial salaries
  and benefits and&#133;that someone is, explicitly, Parliament" [emphasis
  in original]. In the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>, at p. 102, Lamer C.J.C. stated
  that "the requirements laid down in <em>Beauregard</em> and developed
  in these reasons with respect to s. 100 [of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>]
  and superior court judges, are equally applicable to the guarantee of financial
  security provided by s. 11(d) [of the <em>Charter]</em> to provincial court
  judges."</p> 
<p> [42] To these jurisprudential underpinnings, I would add the common sense
  observation, that, at bottom, one of the crucial matters at issue here is the
  expenditure of public funds. In the context of huge government deficits, scarce
  resources, and difficult public policy choices, it is self-evident, in my view,
  that a government would want to know the cost implications of <em>any</em> decision
  it makes. That includes a decision relating to judicial pensions, especially
  in the context of a substantial, and linked, increase in judicial salaries.
  Accordingly, I explicitly agree with the observation of the Divisional Court
  that "[w]ithout an accurate 'price tag', any Government of Ontario response
  would have been, at best, ill informed and perhaps uninformed." </p> 
<p> [43] It follows that the Government's decision to retain PwC to provide advice
  about the 'price tag' of the Commission's three options for pension reform
  was appropriate. In <em>Re British Columbia Legislative Assembly Resolution
  on Judicial Compensation </em>(1998), 160 D.L.R. (4th) 477 at 493 (B.C.C.A.),
  Hall J.A. explained that a government's consideration of the recommendations
  of a judicial compensation commission involves "due reflection and [the
  receipt of] advice from whatever quarter it thinks fit". This is a rather
  sweeping statement which might require refinement if a government engaged in
  a truly unusual post-commission review. Nevertheless, the terseness and breadth
  of Hall J.A.'s statement underline the obvious common sense of the following
  propositions: (1) a government must determine the costs of commission recommendations
  (if the commission has not done this) and (2) there is nothing wrong with a
  government seeking external advice from experts to enable it to determine the
  costs of commission recommendations.</p> 
<p> [44] In summary, the Government's retention of PwC to provide advice about
  the cost implications of the Commission's pension recommendations did not undermine
  the effectiveness of the commission process. Indeed, in my view, the Government's
  decision promoted this important component of the constitutional commission
  process; it showed that the Government intended to conduct a serious analysis
  with respect to those recommendations.</p> 
<p class="indent15"> <strong>(b) The Framework Agreement argument</strong></p> 
<p> [45] The appellants submit that the Government's decision to retain PwC after
  it had received the Commission's recommendations was also contrary to the statutory
  Framework Agreement which governs the process by which judges' pensions are
  determined in Ontario. In support of this position, the appellants advance
  two arguments.</p> 
<p> [46] Their first argument is that the Government's retention of PwC was inconsistent
  with the effective operation of the commission created by the Framework Agreement.
  This argument covers the same ground as the appellants' argument relating to
  the constitutional commission process. Accordingly, it fails.</p> 
<p> [47] The appellants' second argument is that once the Government determined
  that it needed more information - especially financial data - before making
  a decision relating to the Commission's pension recommendations, the Government
  was obligated to return to the commission process so that the Commission could
  revisit the issue. The appellants rely on s. 28 of the Framework Agreement: </p> 
<p class="indent"> 28. The parties agree that the <em>Commission</em> may, within
  30 days, upon application by the Crown or the judges' associations&#133;amend,
  alter or vary its recommendations and report where it is shown to the satisfaction
  of the Commission that it has <em>failed to deal with any matter</em> properly
  arising from the inquiry&#133;or that <em>an error relating to a matter</em>&#133;is
  apparent on the report [emphasis added].</p> 
<p> [48] The Divisional Court observed that s. 28 is permissive, not mandatory,
  and expressed doubt that either of the two substantive bases for returning
  a matter to the Commission was present in this case.</p> 
<p> [49] I agree. The appellants do not assert that the Commission made any error
  in the pension section of its report. Nor would it be fair to conclude that
  the Commission failed to deal with a matter. The Commission dealt at some length
  with judicial pensions. It made several recommendations. It costed those recommendations
  using the judges' current salary as a base. It did not take the extra step
  and provide cost calculations related to its recommendations. However, neither
  did the judges' associations, whose submissions formed the basis of the Commission's
  recommendations. In these circumstances, although s. 28 of the Framework Agreement
  permitted the Government to return to the Commission, it did not require the
  Government to do so.</p> 
<p> [50] I make a final comment before leaving this issue. Before the Divisional
  Court, the parties devoted a great deal of time and effort, principally through
  duelling affidavits, to the question of whether Watson Wyatt's original cost
  calculations were accurate or flawed. This dispute was also raised during the
  appeal hearing.</p> 
<p> [51] Nothing turns on this dispute. The crucial question for the Government
  after it received the Commission's recommendation was how much the various
  pension recommendations would cost <em>when linked to the new, binding judicial
  salary</em>. This calculation had not been done by the judges' associations,
  the Government or the Commission. Accordingly, the Government needed to perform
  this analysis as part of its decision-making process. An accurate or flawed
  Watson Wyatt calculation was only a potential step in that analysis; moreover,
  it was a matter open to both parties to address in their own way, which they
  did.</p> 
<p class="indent"> <strong>(2) The admissibility of the O'Neil affidavits </strong></p> 
<p> [52] In support of its application for judicial review of the Government's
  decision not to adopt the Commission's recommendations relating to judges'
  pensions, the judges' associations filed an affidavit from one of their lawyers
  to which it attached excerpts from the parties' submissions before the Commission,
  the Commission's report and the Government's response.</p> 
<p> [53] The Government filed an affidavit from Owen M. O'Neil of PwC detailing
  PwC's work for the Government after the Government received the Commission's
  recommendations.</p> 
<p> [54] The judges' associations then filed two affidavits by Justice Budgell
  dealing with the Watson Wyatt report and post-commission communications between
  Watson Wyatt and PwC. The Government then filed a second O'Neil affidavit on
  the same topics.</p> 
<p> [55] The appellants submit that the Divisional Court erred by admitting the
  two O'Neil affidavits on the judicial review application. I disagree for three
  reasons.</p> 
<p> [56] First, the appellants explicitly link their argument on this issue to
  their argument on the first issue. As expressed in paragraph 46 of their factum: "It
  is the position of the Judges that if, as submitted above, the process engaged
  in by the Government was unconstitutional and contrary to the Framework Agreement,
  the Divisional Court erred in admitting the contested affidavit evidence." Since
  I have concluded that the Government's retention of PwC after it received the
  Commission's recommendations was both constitutional and in compliance with
  the Framework Agreement, it follows, on the logic of the appellants' own submission,
  that affidavit evidence setting out PwC's role and advice was admissible.</p> 
<p> [57] Second, the judges' associations filed two affidavits dealing with some
  of the same topics as the first O'Neil affidavit. There is nothing in the two
  affidavits from Justice Budgell to indicate that the associations objected
  to the first O'Neil affidavit; indeed, on the contrary, in the first affidavit
  from Justice Budgell, there is a reference, without criticism, to "the
  affidavit of Owen M. O'Neil". </p> 
<p> [58] Third, and most importantly, the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em> requires
  a government to justify its decision to reject a commission's recommendations, "if
  need be, in a court of law" (p. 88). This decision is not an adjudicative
  decision or even a quasi-adjudicative decision. It is, whether made by the
  legislature (as it is in several provinces) or the executive (as it is in Ontario),
  very much a political, or 'legislative', decision.</p> 
<p> [59] In <em>Danson v. Ontario (Attorney General)</em>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1086
  at 1099, Sopinka J. stated: </p> 
<p class="indent"> Legislative facts are those that establish the purpose and 
  background of legislation, including its social, economic and cultural context. 
  Such facts are of a more general nature, and are subject to less stringent admissibility 
  requirements: see e.g., <em>Re Anti-Inflation Act</em>, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373, 
  <em>per</em> Laskin C.J., at p. 391; <em>Re Residential Tenancies Act</em>, 
  1979, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 714, <em>per</em> Dickson J. (as he then was), at p. 723; 
  and <em>Reference re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act</em>, [1984] 
  1 S.C.R. 297, <em>per</em> McIntyre J., at p. 318.</p> 
<p> [60] The Government's decision in the present case, through the Management
  Board of Cabinet, was more akin to a legislative decision than an adjudicative
  decision. It involved historical, social and economic factors and, following
  the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Beauregard</em> and the <em>P.E.I.
  Reference</em>, the need to address in a careful way a fundamental principle
  of the Canadian Constitution, judicial independence. In that context, once
  the Government's decision was challenged in a court of law, it was entirely
  appropriate for the Government to place before the reviewing court both the
  fact of its engagement of PwC and the role PwC's advice played in its decision-making
  process. Indeed, in my view, if the Government had chosen to remain silent
  before the court on these crucial matters, it would have been potentially subject
  to censure for non-disclosure of vital information.</p> 
<p class="indent"> <strong>(3) The constitutionality of the Government's reasons
    for rejection</strong></p> 
<p> [61] This is the central issue on the appeal.</p> 
<p class="indent15"> <strong>(a) The <em>P.E.I. Reference</em></strong></p> 
<p> [62] The 'simple rationality' test was set out in the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>.
  The Supreme Court of Canada held that the constitutional principle of judicial
  independence required that judicial salaries, benefits and pensions be established
  through the vehicle of a commission. The essential attributes of the commission
  process are independence, objectivity and effectiveness. However, the commission
  does not make a <em>final decision</em> with respect to salaries, benefits
  and pensions; it makes <em>recommendations</em>. A government has a duty to
  consider, and respond to, a commission's recommendations. It can accept and
  implement the recommendations. However, it can also reject and refuse to implement
  them.</p> 
<p> [63] If a government rejects a commission's recommendations, judges are entitled
  to challenge the government's decision in the courts. The government will be
  required to defend its decision and the court will be required to affirm it
  or set it aside.</p> 
<p> [64] The crucial question at this juncture is: what is the standard of review
  that a court should apply when reviewing a government's decision not to accept
  a commission's recommendations relating to some aspect of judicial compensation?
  Fortunately, in the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>, the court answered this question
  with, in my view, genuine clarity and simplicity. Lamer C.J.C. stated, at pp.
  110-11: </p> 
<p class="indent"> [T]he standard of justification&#133;is not the same as that
  required under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>. Section 1 imposes a very rigorous
  standard of justification. Not only does it require an important government
  objective but it requires a proportionality between this objective and the
  means employed to pursue it. The party seeking to uphold the impugned state
  action must demonstrate a rational connection between the objective and the
  means chosen, that the means chosen are the least restrictive means or violate
  the right as little as reasonably possible, and that there is a proportionality
  between the effect of the measure and its objective so that the attainment
  of the legislative goal is not outweighed by the abridgment of the right.</p> 
<p class="indent">The standard of justification, here, by contrast, is one of
  simple <em>rationality</em>. It requires that the government articulate a legitimate
  reason for why it has chosen to depart from the recommendation of the commission,
  and if applicable, why it has chosen to treat judges differently from other
  persons paid from the public purse. A reviewing court does not engage in a
  searching analysis of the relationship between ends and means, which is the
  hallmark of a s. 1 analysis. However, the absence of this analysis does not
  mean that the standard of justification is ineffectual. On the contrary, it
  has two aspects. First, it screens out decisions with respect to judicial remuneration
  which are based on purely political considerations, or which are enacted for
  discriminatory reasons. Changes to or freezes in remuneration can only be justified
  for reasons which relate to the public interest, broadly understood. Second,
  if judicial review is sought, a reviewing court must inquire into the reasonableness
  of the factual foundation of the claim made by the government, similar to the
  way that we have evaluated whether there was an economic emergency in Canada
  in our jurisprudence under the division of powers (<em>Reference re Anti-Inflation
  Act</em>, [1976] 2. S.C.R. 373) [emphasis in original].</p> 
<p> [65] In my view, it is clear from this passage that the Supreme Court of
  Canada intended that any judicial review of a government's final decision with
  respect to judicial compensation be a cautious and modest review. The juxtaposition
  in this brief passage of <em>what the review is not to be</em> (a rigorous <em>Charter</em> s.
  1 analysis) and <em>what it is to be</em> (a review that screens out purely
  political or discriminatory decisions and a review of the factual foundation
  of a government's decision on a basis similar to the review of a government's
  declaration of an economic emergency) could not be more striking. It is not
  an exaggeration to say that the juxtaposition chosen by Lamer C.J.C. is one
  between <em>the strictest</em> (section 1 of the <em>Charte</em>r, especially
  as represented by its original formulation in <em>R. v. Oakes</em>, [1986]
  1 S.C.R. 103) and <em>the most deferential</em> (declaration of economic emergency
  in a distribution of powers context) standards of review in the history of
  Canadian constitutional law. The former is truly rigorous, as it should be
  given that the context is a government's attempt to justify a continuation
  of its infringement of a constitutional right protected by the <em>Charter</em>.
  The latter is truly deferential, as it should be given that the context is
  a government's attempt to deal with a matter concerning "social and economic
  policy and hence governmental and legislative judgment" (<em>Reference
  re Anti-Inflation Act</em>, pp. 495-96).</p> 
<p class="indent15"> <strong>(b) Appellate court decisions post-<em>P.E.I. Reference</em></strong></p> 
<p> [66] Since the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>, five provincial appellate courts
  have released six decisions in which they have reviewed government decisions
  not to accept some or all of the recommendations of judges' compensation commissions: <em>Re
  British Columbia Legislative Assembly Resolution on Judicial Compensation,
  supra, </em>("<em>British Columbia Judges</em>"<em>)</em>; <em>Alberta
  Provincial Judges' Assn. v. Alberta </em>(1999), 177 D.L.R. (4th) 418 (Alta.
  C.A.) ("<em>Alberta Judges</em>"); <em>Bodner v. Alberta</em> (2002),
  222 D.L.R. (4th) 284 (Alta. C.A.); <em>Conf&eacute;rence des Juges du Qu&eacute;bec
  v. Qu&eacute;bec (Procureure G&eacute;n&eacute;rale)</em> (2000), 196 D.L.R.
  (4th) 533 (Que. C.A.) ("<em>Quebec Judges</em>"); <em>Provincial
  Court Judges' Assn. of New Brunswick v. New Brunswick (Minister of Justice)</em>,
  [2003] N.B.J. No. 321 (C.A.) ("<em>New Brunswick Judges"</em>); and <em>Newfoundland
  Assn. of Provincial Court Judges v. Newfoundland </em>(2000), 191 D.L.R. (4th)
  225 (Nfld. C.A.) ("<em>Newfoundland Judges</em>").</p> 
<p> [67] In four of these decisions, the courts explicitly recognized the foundation
  of deference enunciated in the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>. In <em>British Columbia
  Judges</em>, at p. 496, Hall J.A. described the jurisdiction of a court reviewing
  a government's rejection decision as a jurisdiction "that no doubt should
  be most cautiously exercised and one that will, hopefully, rarely be needed
  to be invoked." In <em>Alberta Judges</em>, at p. 434, C&ocirc;t&eacute; J.A.
  stated that "in many senses this is a fairly lax test, and it certainly
  does not let a superior court substitute its own opinion for that of the government." In <em>Newfoundland
  Judges</em>, at p. 285, Green J.A. referred to "the low threshold of a
  'simple rationality' justification."</p> 
<p> [68] Finally, in the recent <em>New Brunswick Judges</em> (20 August 2003),
  after an admirable discussion of the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>, Robertson J.A.,
  at para. 113, summarized his understanding of the test: </p> 
<p class="indent"> In conclusion, the simple rationality test requires deference
  to the government's factual justification for its rejection decision. In other
  respects, a government decision to reject a salary recommendation does not
  require a searching examination. A government need only articulate a "legitimate" reason
  for rejection.</p> 
<p> [69] In the present appeal, the appellants rely heavily on the other two
  appellate decisions, <em>Quebec Judges </em>and, especially, the second Alberta
  case, which I will call <em>Bodner</em>.</p> 
<p> [70] The passage in <em>Quebec Judges</em> on which the appellants rely is
  set out in the court's judgment at pp. 545-46: </p> 
<p class="indent"> As we also said above, after the commission's report, the
  Government can refuse the determination for a legitimate reason. </p> 
<p class="indent">A legitimate ground may involve the intrinsic value of the
  commission's decision (a fundamental error of law, a palpable error of fact,
  or an abuse of its power of assessment). A legitimate reason may also result
  from the occurrence of a significant fact since the commission's report was
  tabled. </p> 
<p class="indent">In the absence of an overriding error of law, a palpable error
  of fact, or the occurrence of a new fact, a government can only refuse a commission's
  determination by demonstrating that the commission greatly exceeded its power
  of assessment. In the determination of remuneration and the taking into account
  of the various factors mentioned above, there is a broad scope of power of
  assessment. This power belongs to the commission. It does not suffice that
  a government disagrees with the determination of a commission; the commission
  is not a body which makes recommendations which this government can accept
  or refuse merely because it wants to apply the relevant criteria differently
  and weight them in another manner before making its own decision.</p> 
<p> [71] With respect, I do not agree with this formulation of the test. It reverses
  the focus of the judicial review from the government's decision to the commission's
  decision. I do not accept that a government can reject a commission's recommendation
  only if the commission makes an overriding error of law or a palpable error
  of fact, the commission greatly exceeds its power of assessment, or a new fact
  arises.</p> 
<p> [72] The focus for a court reviewing a government's decision must be the
  government's decision, not the commission's decision. Moreover, within that
  focus, it is entirely permissible - and rational - for a government to reject
  a commission's recommendation without attributing errors of fact, law or jurisdiction
  to the commission. As expressed by Green J.A., at p. 262, in <em>Newfoundland
  Judges</em>: </p> 
<p class="indent"> [I]t is important to recognize that the "simple rationality" test
  does not require that the executive or the legislature demonstrate that the
  commission recommendation is wrong, irrational or unreasonable.&#133;It must
  only demonstrate the rationality of its <em>own</em> decision to depart from
  the commission recommendations. These are not the same thing. The reasons given
  for two differing positions may both be rational [emphasis in original].</p> 
<p> [73] The principal case relied on by the appellants is<em> Bodner</em>, the
  second Alberta judges' compensation case. In their factum under the heading <strong>Divisional
  Court Failed to Apply An Appropriate Standard of Review</strong>, the appellants
  summarize their argument in this fashion: </p> 
<p class="indent"> 52. The Appellants submit that the Divisional Court erred
  in concluding that the Government's justification met the constitutional requirements
  of rationality, including consistency, responsiveness, logic, relevance and
  accuracy. Rather than conducting a "thorough and searching examination
  of the reasons proffered", the Divisional Court adopted an extremely deferential
  approach involving minimal scrutiny, and did not even advert to the more rigorous
  and far less deferential approach taken in decisions of appellate courts in
  other provinces.</p> 
<p class="indent"><em>Bodner v. Alberta</em>, supra, at paras. 108-114.</p> 
<p> [74] In <em>Bodner</em>, an independent commission recommended an increase
  in salary for full-time Justices of the Peace from approximately $55,000 to
  $95,000 per annum and an increase in the<em> per diem</em> rate for part-time
  Justices of the Peace from $220 to $600. The government of Alberta rejected,
  with reasons, these recommendations and imposed increases significantly lower
  than the recommended amounts. The Justices of the Peace challenged the government's
  decision. The chambers judge held in their favour ([2001] 10 W.W.R. 444 (Alta.
  Q.B.)) and ordered the government to implement the commission's recommendations.
  The Court of Appeal dismissed the government's appeal (Paperny and Picard JJ.A.;
  C&ocirc;t&eacute; J.A. dissenting in part).</p> 
<p> [75] In the crucial section of her reasons, titled <strong>Constitutional
    Standard of Justification</strong>, Paperny J.A. said, at pp. 314 and 315: </p> 
<p class="indent"> To ensure that the reasons for justification are constitutionally
  sound, a court must conduct a thorough and searching examination of the reasons
  proffered.</p> 
<p class="center">. . . . .</p> 
<p class="indent">The Supreme Court has mandated that the commission process
  be independent, objective and effective. This demands that the constitutional
  standard of justification be high.</p> 
<p> [76] With respect, I do not agree with these propositions; in my view, they
  run directly contrary to the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>.</p> 
<p> [77] The requirement that "a court must conduct a thorough and searching
  examination of the reasons proffered" is inconsistent with Lamer C.J.C.'s
  admonition, at p. 110, that a reviewing court "does not engage in a searching
  analysis of the relationship between ends or means": see also <em>New
  Brunswick Judges</em>, at para. 113.</p> 
<p> [78] The description of the standard of justification as "high" is,
  in my view, unique in the judges' compensation case law ("a fairly lax
  test": <em>Alberta Judges</em>; "the low threshold": <em>Newfoundland
  Judges</em>). It is also contrary to the whole thrust of the language chosen
  by Lamer C.J.C. in <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>; in particular, it misconceives
  his analogy with the standard of justification for a declaration of economic
  emergency enunciated in<em> Reference re Anti-Inflation Act</em>.</p> 
<p> [79] Paperny J.A. considered the economic emergency analogy in her reasons,
  at p. 315: </p> 
<p class="indent"> [A] court must review the factual underpinnings of the government's
  claimed justification for rejecting commission recommendations on a standard
  of reasonableness. In so doing, the court is to follow the approach taken by
  the Supreme Court in <em>Reference re Anti-Inflation Act</em>.&#133;This necessarily
  involves a two part process. The first question to be answered is whether government
  has established the "exceptional circumstances" required to invoke
  its reliance on what should be a rarely used legislative power. This can be
  seen in <em>Reference re Anti-Inflation</em> where the federal government had
  to demonstrate "exceptional circumstances" to justify resorting to
  the peace, order and good government power during an economic crisis.</p> 
<p class="indent">Assuming the government meets this threshold requirement, the
  next question is whether government's failure to implement the commission recommendations
  is rationally connected to the exceptional circumstances it has purported to
  address.</p> 
<p> [80] Paperny J.A. then applied this two-stage analysis to the decision of
  the government of Alberta to reject the recommendations of the Commission.
  She concluded, at p. 320: </p> 
<p class="indent"> In this case, all the reasons for rejection fail the constitutional
  standard of justification. First, the government has not adduced any evidence
  or made any submissions before this Court or the Court of Queen's Bench that
  circumstances exist to justify the government's resort to its power of rejection.
  There is nothing in this record suggesting any political or economic exigencies
  that demand resort to the power of rejection or modification. On this basis
  alone, the standard of justification has not been met.</p> 
<p> [81] With respect, I do not agree with this analysis; in my view, it represents
  a misreading of Lamer C.J.C.'s analogy in the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em> to
  the standard of justification from <em>Reference re Anti-Inflation Act</em>.</p> 
<p> [82] I do not think that the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em> stands for the proposition
  that a government can reject a commission's recommendations only in 'exceptional
  circumstances'. The point of Lamer C.J.C.'s reference to <em>Reference re Anti-Inflation
  Act</em> was to describe the nature of the justification (simple rationality)
  that a government would need to provide in support of its decision not to accept
  a commission's recommendations. I do not think he intended to import the factual
  context (exceptional circumstances) into a government's decision-making process
  regarding judicial compensation. Accordingly, I do not agree with the Alberta
  Court of Appeal's description of a two-part process. In my view, the first
  part of this process does not exist in the context of the test enunciated in
  the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>.</p> 
<p> [83] I note that <em>New Brunswick Judges</em> makes a similar critique of
  this component of the <em>Bodner</em> decision. After a careful and extended
  analysis, Robertson J.A. reached a conclusion, at para. 119, with which I agree: </p> 
<p class="indent"> In summary, the understanding that a government cannot depart 
  from a salary recommendation without first satisfying an "exceptional circumstances" 
  test has, in my respectful view, no foundation in law. If the law were otherwise 
  it would be difficult to appreciate why the Supreme Court framed the constitutional 
  role of remuneration commissions in terms of a recommendatory mandate. If the 
  Supreme Court intended that deference belongs to the commissions, it is difficult 
  to appreciate why the Supreme Court imposed a less demanding review standard 
  on a government decision, at least when compared to the more exacting standard 
  available under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>. In my respectful view, to grant 
  deference to the commission rather than the government comes perilously close 
  to adopting a constitutional process that resembles binding arbitration.</p> 
<p class="indent15"> <strong>(c) Application</strong></p> 
<p> [84] I turn, then, to the question of whether the Government's decision not
  to accept the pension recommendations of the Commission met the 'simple rationality'
  test from the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>. The appellants contend that the Government's
  reasons were defective in three respects: (1) they were inconsistent with the
  Government's position before the Commission; (2) they were not responsive to
  the Commission's recommendations; and (3) they did not meet the standard of
  logic and rationality.</p> 
<p> [85] I do not agree with these submissions. The Divisional Court described
  the Government's reasons for not accepting the Commission's recommendations
  as "clear, logical, relevant and consistent with the Government's position
  taken before the Commission." I agree with this description. I would supplement
  the Divisional Court's analysis and conclusions with a few additional observations
  about the Government's seven reasons (set out in the <strong>Facts</strong> section
  of these reasons), with a particular emphasis on the first and seventh reasons,
  which I will leave to the end.</p> 
<p> [86] The second reason, relating to the fact that judges' pensions will not
  erode over time, is an important factor for a government to consider. In both <em>Beauregard</em> and
  the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>, the Supreme Court of Canada cautioned against
  measures taken by a government that would impair or erode the financial security
  of judges. The indexing of the pensions of retired judges to the salary of
  active judges in Ontario is a strong bulwark against erosion. It is, therefore,
  reasonable for the Government to consider this factor.</p> 
<p> [87] The third reason, relating to the compensation gap between federal and
  provincial judges, is directly responsive to one of the overarching themes
  of the Commission's recommendations. There is nothing irrational in a government
  noting that the gap between these judges has "significantly narrowed" as
  a result of implementation of a salary recommendation, but then deciding not
  to narrow the gap even more by revising the pension scheme for judges. This
  is especially so given that the Commission itself did not recommend complete
  parity.</p> 
<p> [88] The fourth reason, relating to the genesis of the judges' current pension
  plan and recent demographic information about judges, was a central feature
  of the Government's submissions to the Commission and was referred to in the
  Commission's report. I cannot see how the Government's decision in 2000 not
  to change a pension scheme that had been developed through a joint effort by
  judges and the Government in 1992 could be labelled irrational.</p> 
<p> [89] The fifth reason, relating to whether a 75 per cent replacement ratio
  (of retirement income to final salary) was achievable under the current pension
  arrangement, was, again, both raised by the parties in their submissions to
  the Commission and addressed by the Commission. The Commission did not express
  a view about whether the current pension, coupled with pre-appointment savings,
  would enable most judges to achieve this ratio. Accordingly, the Government's
  reliance on this reason was not even a rejection of a conclusion by the Commission.</p> 
<p> [90] The sixth reason, relating to a comparison of pensions for Ontario judges
  with those for judges in other provinces, strikes me as a natural factor for
  a government to consider. The Government provided extensive analysis of comparative
  salaries in its submissions to the Commission and contended that its arguments
  relating to salaries also applied to pensions. Accordingly, this reason was
  both consistent with its position before the Commission and responsive to the
  Commission's recommendations.</p> 
<p> [91] I turn to the Government's first and seventh reasons which, taken together,
  I would label the fiscal restraint reason. The Government's first and seventh
  reasons were: </p> 
<p class="indent"> 1. The current pension entitlements are appropriate and their
  value has already increased as a result of salary increases awarded by the
  Commission. The salary increase awarded by the Commission increased the value
  of a judge's pension benefit by approximately 28%.</p> 
<p class="center">. . . . .</p> 
<p class="indent">7. The Commission's recommendations concerning pensions are
  not appropriate under the Government's continued fiscal restraint. Management
  Board cannot look at an issue in isolation, but must view it within the framework
  of balancing competing interests for the Government's limited resources. In
  balancing competing interests, it attempts to maximize social utility, considering
  that the taxpayers of Ontario will bear the costs. Government must continue
  to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent more effectively and efficiently
  as it moves toward a balanced budget. The Government's announcement of $300
  million in expenditure reductions on November 18, 1999 is evidence of the Government's
  continued commitment to fiscal restraint to strengthen the Ontario economy. </p> 
<p> [92] The appellants rely on the Commission's description of the Ontario economy: "It
  is perhaps not too strong a statement to say that the Ontario economy, in terms
  of growth, job creation and deficit reduction, has never been stronger." In
  light of this finding, the appellants assert that it was incumbent that the
  Government "do more than merely assert that it was balancing competing
  interests and flag its commitment to restraint to support its position" (Factum,
  para. 67).</p> 
<p> [93] I do not regard this as a fair description of the Government's response.</p> 
<p> [94] In its submissions to the Commission, the Government discussed the provincial
  economy in great detail, with a comprehensive description of the provincial
  deficit and debt, recent spending cuts, settlements for other groups paid by
  public funds and downsizing in the public sector. There is no question that
  fiscal restraint was the centerpiece of the Government's policy in the entire
  1998-2000 period.</p> 
<p> [95] The Commission considered the Government's economic arguments. The majority,
  as the passage set out above indicates, was not persuaded by them. The minority
  attached greater significance to them: </p> 
<p class="indent"> There is no doubt that the condition of the economy has improved
  since the last Triennial Commission, and continues to show signs of robustness.
  What has not improved is the debt load. The general response to the most recent
  Budget indicates there continues to be widespread concern from many sectors
  about both the size of the debt ($105 billion) and the annual fiscal deficit
  ($3.2 billion).</p> 
<p> [96] With respect to the first reason, the starting point is recognition
  that the judges' pensions increased by 28 per cent because of the 28 per cent
  salary increase. The annual cost of the pension plan as a percentage of salary
  for 1998-1999 increased from 27.1 per cent to 34.5 per cent. In real dollar
  terms, the annual costs of the plan in the first year alone rose from $9.4
  million to $14 million, an almost 50 per cent increase in the overall cost
  of the plan. These annual costs would continue to increase as the salary increased
  from $150,000 in 1998 to $160,000 in 1999 and $170,000 in 2000. There is no
  question that as a result of the salary increase, the existing pension plan
  became more lucrative for the judges and more expensive for the Government.</p> 
<p> [97] With respect to the seventh reason, when the Government made its decision
  in 2000, deficit and debt reduction was still a crucial component of the Government's
  policy and program, the Government had just announced a further cut in spending
  of $300 million, and salary and wage increases throughout the public sector
  were non-existent or very low.</p> 
<p> [98] This, then, was the factual background underpinning the Government's
  first and seventh reasons. Do those reasons survive the 'simple rationality'
  standard? In order to answer this question, I return to <em>Beauregard</em> and
  the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>.</p> 
<p> [99] A central theme of both cases is that, as a general proposition, a government
  which treats judges, in terms of compensation, as well as or better than other
  people paid from the public purse does not run afoul of the constitutional
  principle of judicial independence.</p> 
<p> [100] In <em>Beauregard</em>, after an extended discussion of judicial independence
  and a careful analysis of the new federal law requiring judges to contribute
  to their pension plan, Dickson C.J.C. addressed, at p. 77, their intersection: </p> 
<p class="indent"> It is very difficult for me to see any connection between
  these essential conditions of judicial independence and Parliament's decision
  to establish a pension scheme for judges and to expect judges to make contributions
  toward the benefits established by the scheme. At the end of the day, all s.
  29.1 of the <em>Judges Act </em>does, pursuant to the constitutional obligation
  imposed by s. 100 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>, is treat judges in
  accordance with standard, widely used and generally accepted pension schemes
  in Canada. From that factual reality it is far too long a stretch, in my opinion,
  to the conclusion that s. 29.1 of the <em>Judges Act</em> violates judicial
  independence.</p> 
<p> [101] Lamer C.J.C. sounded a similar note in the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>,
  at pp. 111 and 117: </p> 
<p class="indent"> Although the test of justification - one of simple rationality
  - must be met by all measures which affect judicial remuneration and which
  depart from the recommendation of the salary commission, some will satisfy
  that test more easily than others, because they pose less of a danger of being
  used as a means of economic manipulation, and hence of political interference.
  Across-the-board measures which affect substantially every person who is paid
  from the public purse, in my opinion, are<em> prima facie</em> rational. For
  example, an across-the-board reduction in salaries that includes judges will
  typically be designed to effectuate the government's overall fiscal priorities,
  and hence will usually be aimed at furthering some sort of larger public interest.
  By contrast, a measure directed at judges alone may require a somewhat fuller
  explanation, precisely because it is directed at judges alone.</p> 
<p class="center">. . . . .</p> 
<p class="indent">Finally, I want to emphasize that the guarantee of a minimum
  acceptable level of judicial remuneration is not a device to shield the courts
  from the effects of deficit reduction. Nothing would be more damaging to the
  reputation of the judiciary and the administration of justice than a perception
  that judges were not shouldering their share of the burden in difficult economic
  times.</p> 
<p> [102] It seems to me that <em>Beauregard</em> and the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em> illuminate
  quite clearly what is and what is not constitutionally permissible when a government
  chooses to reject a judges' compensation commission's recommendations.</p> 
<p> [103] The impermissible rejection is one in which a government makes its
  decision "for an improper or colourable purpose" or engages in "discriminatory
  treatment of judges vis-&agrave;-vis other citizens" (<em>Beauregard</em>,
  p. 77). The impermissible rejection is also one in which a government "single[s]
  out judges as a class for a pay reduction" or reduces judicial compensation "below
  a basic minimum level of remuneration which is required for the office of a
  judge", or deals with compensation in a manner that "raises the spectre
  of political interference through economic manipulation" (<em>P.E.I. Reference</em>,
  pp. 89 and 93).</p> 
<p> [104] There is not a hint that the Government's rejection of the Commission's
  recommendations falls into any of these prohibited realms.</p> 
<p> [105] The permissible rejection is one which treats judges "in accordance
  with standard, widely used and generally accepted" practices (<em>Beauregard</em>,
  p. 77) or as part of "[a]cross-the-board measures which affect substantially
  every person who is paid from the public purse" (<em>P.E.I. Reference</em>,
  p. 111).</p> 
<p> [106] The appellants were treated substantially better than these standards.
  They received a 28 per cent increase in salary and pension at a time when no
  one in the public sector received anything close to such an increase.</p> 
<p> [107] For these reasons, I conclude that the Government's rejection of the
  Commission's recommendations to improve the judges' pension plan complies with
  the 'simple rationality' standard established in the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>.
  It was not irrational for the Government to respond to the Commission, in effect,
  that a 28 per cent increase in judges' salary and pension is enough at this
  time in light of economic conditions in Ontario and the Government's treatment
  of other people who receive their salaries and wages from the public purse.</p> 
<p> <strong> E. CONCLUSION AND DISPOSITION</strong></p> 
<p> [108] In the end, this appeal is close, in a factual context, to <em>Beauregard</em>.
  In <em>Beauregard</em>, the federal government amended the<em> Judges Act</em> to
  provide federal judges with a much higher salary and pension. At the same time,
  the government introduced a measure requiring the judges to contribute a percentage
  of their salaries towards their pensions. This measure reduced the judges'
  salaries.</p> 
<p> [109] Dickson C.J.C. regarded it as appropriate to look at the entire compensation
  package established by the law. After noting that governments could not deal
  with judges' compensation for an improper or colourable purpose or treat judges
  in a discriminatory fashion, he continued, at p. 78: </p> 
<p class="indent"> There is no suggestion, however, of any of these considerations
  in the present appeal. First, the motive underlying s. 29.1 of the <em>Judges
  Act</em>, especially when viewed in the context of the substantial increase
  in salaries received by superior court judges at virtually the same time, was,
  without question, to try to deal fairly with judges and with judicial salaries
  and pensions. Secondly, although superior court judges were required to contribute
  to their pension benefits commencing December 20, 1975, the contributory scheme
  was effectively introduced as part of a remuneration package which included
  a 39 per cent salary increase and a 50 per cent increase in pensions to dependants.
  The salary and pension changes were intended to be complementary and, as a
  comprehensive package, did not diminish, reduce or impair the financial position
  of federally-appointed judges.</p> 
<p> [110] In this appeal, Ontario judges received a 28 per cent increase in their
  salary and pension. The Government did not, as in <em>Beauregard</em>, set
  off some of the increased pension by introducing a change in the pension plan.
  Rather, the Government chose not to accept a commission recommendation that
  would have increased judges' pensions even more than 28 per cent. In this context,
  the appellants' assertion that the Government's decision violates judicial
  independence is, in the words of Dickson C.J.C., at p. 77, "far too long
  a stretch".</p> 
<p> [111] I conclude with a final observation. In <em>Bodner</em>, C&ocirc;t&eacute; J.A.
  recognized the awkward position which governments are in after the <em>P.E.I.
  Reference</em>. They make submissions to an independent commission. Later,
  they must consider and, ultimately, accept or reject the commission's recommendations.
  C&ocirc;t&eacute; J.A. said, at p. 292: </p> 
<p class="indent"> There should be a principled way to handle the interaction
  of the two stages: when the government puts its case to the Commission, and
  then later when the government accepts or rejects the Commission's recommendations,
  with reasons.</p> 
<p> [112] I agree with this thoughtful observation. It would be quite wrong for
  governments to attempt to use their role as final decision-maker to circumvent
  the commission process. There is an essential integrity in that process which
  governments must respect.</p> 
<p> [113] However, it seems to me that C&ocirc;t&eacute; J.A.'s observation also
  applies to the judiciary. The judiciary also plays a role at two stages. In
  the first stage, members of the judiciary make submissions to a commission.
  Here, the judiciary plays the role of supplicant. In the second stage, which
  is triggered if those members of the judiciary challenge a government's decision
  to reject the commission's recommendations, the judiciary plays the role of
  decision-maker when it reviews the government's decision.</p> 
<p> [114] In my view, it is crucial that the judiciary also respect the integrity
  of the commission process. When reviewing government decisions under the 'simple
  rationality' test, courts should focus on the permissible and impermissible
  factors set out clearly in <em>Beauregard</em> and the <em>P.E.I. Reference</em>.</p> 
<p> [115] Courts should be vigilant to identify and reject government decisions
  that are made for an improper or colourable purpose, reduce the compensation
  of judges below a basic minimum, or single out judges for negative treatment.</p> 
<p> [116] Courts should be careful not to go beyond these factors. In particular,
  courts should not misuse the introduction of a constitutional process for determining
  judicial compensation as a vehicle to shield the judiciary from government
  decisions that treat them as well as, or even better than, others paid from
  the public purse. To do this would trivialize the great principle of judicial
  independence.</p> 
<p> [117] I would dismiss the appeal, without costs.</p>
