<p><strong>Synopsis of <em>The Ontario Judges' Association, The Ontario Family
      Law Judges' Association and the Ontario Provincial Court (Civil Division)
      Judges' Association v. The Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of
      Ontario, as represented by the Chair of the Management Board </em></strong></p> 
<p>On September 16 th and 17 th , 2003, a panel of the Court of Appeal for Ontario,
  composed of Associate Chief Justice Dennis O'Connor and Justices Stephen Borins
  and James MacPherson, heard appeals from a decision of Ontario's Divisional
  Court dated February 15, 2002. In that decision, Superior Court Justices John
  O'Driscoll, Edward Then and Tamarin Dunnet dismissed an application for judicial
  review by The Ontario Judges' Association, The Ontario Family Law Judges' Association
  and the Ontario Provincial Court (Civil Division) Judges' Association (“the
  judges' associations”). The judges' associations sought judicial review of
  a decision by Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of Ontario, as
  represented by the Chair of the Management Board (“the Government”) not to
  accept the recommendations of the Fourth Triennial Provincial Judges' Remuneration
  Commission (“the Commission”) relating to pensions for provincial judges. </p> 
<h2>Background </h2> 
<p>The judges' associations represented the justices of the Ontario Court of
  Justice before tthe Commission. The Commission was convened to make recommendations
  relating to judicial compensation for the 1998-2000 period. The Commission's
  jurisdiction and terms of reference were governed by the <em>Courts of Justice
  Act </em> and the Framework Agreement attached as a schedule to that Act.  The
  Commission's recommendations relating to judicial salaries, benefits and allowances
  were binding on the Government. Its recommendations relating to judicial pensions
  were not binding. </p> 
<p>The Commission conducted hearings and received several written submissions
  from the judges' associations and the Government in late 1998 and early 1999.  On
  May 20, 1999, the Commission released its report.  In regard to salary,
  the Commission recommended a staged increase from the then base salary of $130,810
  to $150,000 in 1998, $160,000 in 1999 and $170,000 in 2000. This represented
  a 28 per cent salary increase. Since provincial judges' pensions are linked
  with the current salaries of provincial judges, this salary increase also increased
  provincial judges' pensions. </p> 
<p>The Commission also recommended significant improvements to the provincial
  judges' pension scheme. At the time, provincial judges were entitled to a base
  pension of 45 per cent of salary at 65 years of age and after 15 years of service.
  The Commission offered three different options for improving the provincial
  judges' pension scheme, and recommended that the Government implement one of
  the three options. The Commission also recommended that the Government reform
  its treatment of provincial judges who retired before age 65. </p> 
<p>The Government implemented the Commission's recommendations relating to salary,
  which were binding on the Government.  The Government engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers
  LLP (“PwC”) to review the Commission's pension recommendations. In particular,
  PwC was engaged to determine the cost of the recommended pension options in
  light of the salary increases implemented by the Government. </p> 
<p>On February 1, 2000, the Government indicated in a letter to the Chair of
  the Commission that it had decided not to implement any of the recommendations
  of the Commission concerning pensions. The letter included seven reasons for
  this decision. </p> 
<p>On August 10, 2000, t he judges' associations sought judicial review of the
  Government's decision not to accept the Commission's recommendations relating
  to pensions. They sought an order quashing and setting aside the Government's
  decision and an order directing the Government to implement the Commission's
  recommendations relating to judges' pensions. In response to this application
  for judicial review, the Government filed two affidavits by Owen M. O'Neil,
  the current senior team leader at PwC on the judges' pension file, detailing
  PwC's work for the Government. </p> 
<p>The Divisional Court dismissed the application for judicial review. The Divisional
  Court found that (1) the Government's engagement of the actuarial firm following
  receipt of the Commission's recommendations did not render the commission process
  ineffective, nor did it run contrary to the Framework Agreement governing the
  commission process; (2) the O'Neil affidavits were admissible; and (3) the
  Government's reasons for rejecting the Commission's pension recommendations
  complied with the 'simple rationality' test established by the Supreme Court
  in the <em>P.E.I. Reference </em>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3. The judges' associations
  appealed. </p> 
<h2>Decision of the Court of Appeal </h2> 
<p>The Court of Appeal unanimously affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court
  and dismissed the judges' associations' appeal. </p> 
<p>The Court considered the following issues: </p> 
<ol>
  <li>Did the Divisional Court err by concluding that the Government's engagement 
    of PwC after the Commission delivered its report was constitutional and complied 
    with the Framework Agreement?</li>
  <li>Did the Divisional Court err by admitting the two O'Neil affidavits tendered 
    by the Government in the judicial review proceedings? </li>
  <li>Did the Divisional Court err by concluding that the Government's reasons 
    for not accepting the Commission's recommendations relating to judges' pensions 
    met the 'simple rationality' test from the <em>P.E.I. Reference </em>? </li>
</ol>
<p>The Court began its reasons by noting that judicial independence is a constitutional
  principle. This principle imposes constitutional requirements on the process
  by which judicial compensation is set. In the <em>P.E.I. Reference </em>, the
  Supreme Court held that in order to ensure judicial independence, judicial
  compensation must be determined through an independent commission process.  Once
  a commission has made its report, the government must consider that report.  The
  government is not bound to accept the commission's recommendations; however,
  the recommendations “should not be set aside lightly”. </p> 
<p>On the first issue, the judges' associations argued that the constitutional
  imperative that the commission process be effective required the Government
  to put all of the information and arguments which supported its position before
  the Commission. The Court found that (1) a government considering commission
  recommendations must determine the costs of those recommendations (if the costs
  are unknown) and (2) a government may seek external advice from experts to
  determine those costs. The Commission did not determine the costs of the three
  pension models that it recommended when those models were linked with the judges'
  new salaries. The judges' associations also argued that if the Government sought
  additional information regarding the costs of the pension recommendations,
  it was obligated to return to the commission process so that the Commission
  could determine those costs. The Court found that while the Framework Agreement
  permitted the Government to return to the commission process for this reason,
  the Government was not obligated to do so. </p> 
<p>On the second issue, the Court explained that pursuant to the <em>P.E.I. Reference </em>,
  if a government rejects the recommendations of a commission, it must be prepared
  to justify that decision, “if need be, in a court of law”. Once the Government's
  decision was challenged in a court of law, it was entirely appropriate for
  the Government to place before the reviewing court both the fact of its engagement
  of PwC and the role PwC's advice played in its decision-making process.
  Hence the Divisional Court did not err by admitting the two O'Neil affidavits. </p> 
<p>On the third issue, the Court found that any judicial review of a government's
  final decision with respect to judicial compensation should be a cautious and
  modest review. In the <em>P.E.I. Reference </em>, the Supreme Court stated
  that the standard of review in this context was one of 'simple rationality'.
  The Supreme Court cautioned that a reviewing court applying this standard “does
  not engage in a searching analysis of the relationship between ends and means”.
  The purpose of the 'simple rationality' test is to screen out government decisions
  that are based on purely political or discriminatory reasons and to review
  the reasonableness of the factual foundation underlying a government's decision.
  The Court agreed with the Divisional Court that the Government's reasons were “clear,
  logical, relevant and consistent with the Government's position taken before
  the Commission.” It was not irrational for the Government to respond to the
  Commission, in effect, that a 28 per cent increase in judges' salary and pension
  was enough at that time in light of economic conditions in Ontario and the
  Government's treatment of other people who received their salaries and wages
  from the public purse. The Court therefore dismissed the appeal. </p>
