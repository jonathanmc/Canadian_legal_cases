<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Where, as in this case, the defence of self-defence rested on an apprehended 
  assault, the trial judge's direction that the jury should consider the reasonableness 
  of the appellant's belief in the context of deciding whether there was an unlawful 
  assault was appropriate.</p>
<p>
  [2] We see no error in the instruction on s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>
  [3] We also see no error in the failure to instruct on s. 37. Trial counsel 
  did not request the instruction. The only possible way that s. 37 may have been 
  engaged was if the appellant provoked the assault, thereby removing himself 
  from s. 34(1). The trial judge all but took that possibility away from the jury 
  in his instruction. In all other aspects, s. 37 presented a much higher hurdle 
  to the appellant than did s. 34(1).</p>
<p>
  [4] The Crown relied on the evidence of the appellant's conduct immediately 
  after the assault and his statement to the police to challenge the credibility 
  of the appellant's evidence that he acted in self-defence. The trial judge dealt 
  with this evidence in the same way in his instructions. We see no error.</p>
<p>
  [5] The trial judge admitted evidence of the deceased's peaceful disposition. 
  We see no error in his ruling. The defence &quot;opened the door&quot; to the 
  evidence in its cross-examination and in any event, the evidence was relatively 
  innocuous.</p>
<p>
  [6] Appeal dismissed.</p>
