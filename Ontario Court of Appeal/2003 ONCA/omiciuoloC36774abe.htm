<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The appellant appeals from the dismissal of his claim for damages arising 
  from a motor vehicle accident, as well as from the trial judge's finding that 
  his damages were not caused by the accident. <br>
</p>
<P>[2] Bearing in mind that it is not our function to retry the case, we are satisfied 
  that there was evidence to support the finding of the trial judge that the appellant 
  failed to prove that the respondent was a fault in causing the accident. As 
  the appellant has not succeeded on this aspect of his appeal, it is unnecessary 
  to consider the damages appeal.<br>
</p>
<P>[3] Therefore, we would dismiss the appeal with costs on a partial indemnity 
  scale fixed at $17,500 inclusive of disbursements, plus GST.</p>
