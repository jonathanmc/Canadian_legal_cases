<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] It was open to the trial judge to treat the respondent's bonus and profit 
  sharing as a form of deferred compensation. There was evidence that when the 
  respondent was hired in 1988, he was told that the bonus and profit sharing 
  would be treated as such. It was not until 1997 that the annual compensation 
  statements provided to the respondent by the appellant referred to the eligibility 
  requirements for payment of the bonus and profit sharing. Moreover, consistent 
  with the notion of deferred compensation, the evidence showed that the bonus 
  and profit sharing formed a substantial portion of the respondent's compensation 
  each year. During the years 1993 to 1997, they constituted just over one half 
  of his total compensation. In these circumstances, the trial judge properly 
  included the amounts in issue in the damage award.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] The trial judge awarded damages for one week's vacation earned but not 
  taken. We see no error in that award.<br>
</p>
<P>[3] The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.<br>
</p>
<P>[4] Costs to the respondent are fixed on a partial indemnity basis in the amount 
  of $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
