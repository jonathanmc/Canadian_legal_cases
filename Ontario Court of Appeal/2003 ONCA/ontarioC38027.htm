<p>On appeal from the order of Justice R. J. Flinn of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated February 26, 2002.</p>

<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, Thames Sales Yards Limited is an Ontario cattle dealer who 
  challenges the obligation to pay $2.25 per head of cattle to the respondent 
  Ontario Cattlemen's Association as a license fee on sales to an American slaughter 
  and packinghouse. By a judgment of February 26, 2002, Flinn J. dismissed a motion 
  by the appellant for a declaration that the license fee is an indirect tax and 
  thus beyond the powers of the Province of Ontario, or is a direct tax that is 
  invalid, finding its source in a regulation rather than a statute, and is ultra 
  vires the province to the extent that it purports to apply to export sales. 
  Flinn J. also granted judgment in favour of the respondent's motion that it 
  was entitled to recover the arrears of fees and future assessments in respect 
  of export sales. The Attorney General of Ontario has intervened on the constitutional 
  issues.</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent association was established under the terms of the Agricultural 
  and Horticultural Organizations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.A.9, the objects of which 
  include the promotion of the sale and export of agricultural products. The association's 
  board of directors is composed of representatives elected by 49 local cattlemen's 
  associations. The Beef Cattle Marketing Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.B.5, which applies 
  specifically to this association, expands upon the description of its objects 
  and powers, and provides a funding mechanism through licence fees on cattle 
  sales. These are fixed by Regulation 54, amended to O/Reg. 291/96, at $2.25 
  for each head of cattle sold. </p>
<p>
  [3] Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Regulation read:</p>
<p>
  3. The licence fees payable by a person who sells cattle shall be $2.25 for 
  each head of cattle sold. O. Reg. 291/96, s. 1.</p>
<p>
  4. Subject to section 5, every person who sells cattle shall pay the licence 
  fees referred to in section 3 to the association. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 54, s. 4.</p>
<p>
  5. (1) Every plant operator, public auction sale operator and livestock dealer 
  who receives cattle from a seller thereof shall deduct, from the money payable 
  to the seller, the licence fees payable by the seller to the association respecting 
  the cattle. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 54, s. 5(1); O. Reg. 154/92, s. 3(1).</p>
<p>
  (2) On or before the 15th day of each month, every plant operator, public auction 
  sale operator and livestock dealer shall forward to the association,</p>
<p>
  (a) all licence fees deducted by the operator or dealer under subsection (1) 
  during the preceding calendar month; and</p>
<p>
  (b) a statement showing the number of head of cattle sold and full name, address 
  and postal code of each seller from whom licence fees were deducted during the 
  preceding calendar month. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 54, s. 5(2); O. Reg. 154/92, s. 
  3(2, 3).</p>
<p>
  [4] This is very plain wording setting the amount of the fee, making it payable 
  by the seller, and directing that it be collected and remitted by the purchaser. 
  The fact that the purchaser is outside the jurisdiction does not alter the obligation 
  upon the seller imposed by s. 3.</p>
<p>
  [5] The cattle industry is composed of producers, auction yards, dealers and 
  packinghouses. The appellant is a dealer and sells most of its cattle to a packinghouse 
  in Illinois. Some of the cattle it sells have been sold previously and thus 
  attract more than one license fee. In addition, and this undoubtedly annoys 
  the appellant, it pays a similar fee in Illinois on the same sales attracting 
  the fees in dispute in this proceeding.</p>
<p>
  [6] We are of the view that this appeal should be dismissed. The focus of the 
  appeal was very different from that before the applications judge. There, the 
  main issue was the question whether the licence fee in this case was a fee or 
  was a disguised tax in order to be intra vires the Legislature of the Province. 
  Further, it could not be authorized by mere regulation. If a fee, it must be 
  imposed under a provincial head of power other than the taxing power.</p>
<p>
  [7] On all of these issues we agree with the applications judge's finding that 
  this was a properly authorized fee, and not a tax, for the reasons he gave.</p>
<p>
  [8] The focus on appeal was whether the regulation in question should be read 
  down so as not to apply to the sale of cattle outside the province. In our view, 
  the answer to that question is &quot;no&quot;. We have to look at the pith and 
  substance of the legislation in question to determine its purpose. This association 
  is incorporated under the Agricultural and Horticultural Organization Act. Section 
  28 of that Act sets out the purposes of the association as expanded by s. 2 
  of the Beef Cattle Marketing Act, generally to stimulate and promote the sale 
  of cattle and to disseminate information concerning the industry. The purpose 
  of the fee is to fund this association. It is clear that the association is 
  for the benefit of all cattlemen in Ontario. The appellant is without a doubt 
  carrying on business in Ontario. It resides in Ontario. It raises cattle in 
  Ontario. It benefits from the services of the association. The fact that the 
  quantum of the fee is defined in terms of the number of sales is simply a method 
  of assessing the size of each business and thus the contribution to the fund. 
  The license is payable by the seller pursuant to s. 3 of Regulation 54 as amended 
  to O/Reg. 291/96. The appellant is a seller of cattle carrying on business in 
  Ontario. It is irrelevant whether cattle are sold to people residing in the 
  United States, in Quebec or elsewhere, who are not subject to s. 5 of Regulation 
  54 as that section serves merely to enforce the licence fee that is imposed 
  by s. 3. The extra territorial effect, if any, is minimal and does not affect 
  the constitutional validity of this legislation. Hence, we would dismiss the 
  appeal. The respondent has not asked for costs and none will be awarded.</p>
