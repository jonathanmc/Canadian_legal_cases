<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Lee K. Ferrier of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated May 23, 2001, reported at [2001] O.J. No. 1946. </p>
<p>
  CARTHY J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] There are two appeals before us from judgments in two actions that were 
  tried together in which the plaintiff, Orlando, sought damages from the defendant, 
  Domtar, for the cost of replacing corroded steel roofs on two warehouse buildings. 
  The claims against the co-defendants who installed the roofs were dropped prior 
  to trial. After a lengthy trial, Ferrier J. found both parties to be negligent, 
  and assigned 90% of the fault to the plaintiff. Accordingly, he awarded Orlando 
  $53,551.60 in respect of what I will call the Coast building and $106,615.50 
  in respect of what I will call the Cooper building. The plaintiff appeals and 
  the defendant cross-appeals against the judgments, each claiming essentially 
  that the other should bear the full blame and, in the case of the appellant, 
  that Domtar should at least bear a larger percentage of responsibility.</p>
<p>
  [2] The trial judge analyzed the evidence from a lengthy trial in meticulous 
  and comprehensive reasons. I will attempt no more than a summary of the facts 
  necessary to an understanding of the issues on appeal.</p>
<p>
  [3] Orlando is a developer of properties and buildings. It owns over 300 buildings, 
  most of which are industrial and located in southern Ontario. It does its own 
  architectural and structural design work. We are concerned with two flat-roofed 
  warehouses constructed by Orlando in or about 1990.</p>
<p>
  [4] A typical flat-roofed building is covered by a ribbed steel deck, on top 
  of which an insulation material is affixed. Other materials, which are irrelevant 
  to issues in these actions, are layered on top of the insulation. The Ontario 
  Building Code, R.R.O., Reg. 61, ss. 5.2 and 5.3 requires, in specified circumstances, 
  a vapour barrier and an air barrier. A combined vapour-air barrier is commonly 
  referred to as a &quot;vapour barrier&quot;. The vapour barrier is placed between 
  the steel deck and the insulation. It might typically comprise a sheet of polyethylene 
  that is sealed at all edges and perforations. Its main function is to prevent 
  condensation on the steel deck as warm humid air inside the building is cooled 
  by outside air.</p>
<p>
  [5] For at least ten years prior to 1990, Orlando had used fibreglass insulation. 
  It was not its practice to install a vapour barrier over the warehouse portion 
  of its buildings, notwithstanding the Ontario Building Code requirement.</p>
<p> [6] When the Cooper and Coast buildings were designed, Orlando decided to 
  use an insulation product known as phenolic foam. Phenolic foam was manufactured 
  and sold by Domtar, and claimed to have a higher &quot;R value&quot; than fibreglass.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  It contains a small amount of each of formic and sulfonic acids, both of which 
  are corrosive if leached from the foam by moisture.</p>
<p>
  [7] The Canadian General Standards Board, a national standards-writing organization, 
  published a standard for phenolic foam insulation boards that contained a note 
  reading: </p>
<p class="indent">
  8.5 Corrosion - Phenolic foams may contain some corrosive compounds. When it 
  is anticipated that the foam will be in direct contact with metal, the supplier 
  shall provide the proper installation procedure.</p>
<p>
  [8] Domtar was aware that Orlando did not use vapour barriers in the warehouse 
  portions of its buildings and did not inform Orlando of the acidic content of 
  its product. Its sales brochure refers to compliance with the Canadian General 
  Standards Board requirements, but makes no specific reference to corrosive compounds. 
  The sales brochure reference to vapour barriers reads: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Vapour Retarder: </p>
<p class="indent"> Responsibility for the inclusion of a vapour retarder within 
  the roofing assembly rests with the design authority.</p>
<p class="indent">A vapour retarder performs the vital function of preventing 
  moisture vapour within the interior atmosphere of the building from entering 
  the roof insulation and roof assembly. Moisture entering the roofing assembly 
  can cause insulation to lose its thermal performance and contribute to poor 
  membrane performance.</p>
<p class="indent">Factors when selecting a vapour retarder should include interior 
  relative humidity, climatic conditions, and dew point.</p>
<p>
  Thus, while the Standards Board note refers to corrosion, the brochure refers 
  to degradation of the R value.</p>
<p>
  [9] The reader will at this point in the narrative have guessed that in the 
  warehouse portion of each building condensation occurred above the steel deck, 
  that acid, particularly formic acid, was dissolved in the water, and that sufficient 
  corrosion of the steel decks ensued that, for safety reasons alone, both roofs 
  needed replacement well before their life expectancy.</p>
<p>
  [10] No issue is taken with the preceding facts by the parties to the appeal. 
  The contention of each of the appellant and cross-appellant is that the trial 
  judge erred in the application of these facts and associated expert opinions 
  in reaching his conclusion. Each says that the other is totally at fault for 
  the damage. Alternatively, Orlando claims that the apportionment was wrong.</p>
<p>
  [11] The essence of the trial judge's reasoned conclusion is that Orlando was 
  at fault for failure to use a vapour barrier and Domtar was at fault for failure 
  to warn of the corrosive potential in the use of its phenolic foam without a 
  vapour barrier. He found the predominant cause of the corrosion of the steel 
  deck was the water vapour and that the formic acid was a minor contributor to, 
  perhaps only an accelerator of, the corrosion that was being caused by the water. 
  Thus, he allocated 90 per cent responsibility to Orlando and 10 per cent to 
  Domtar.</p>
<p>
  [12] It is my conclusion that the trial judge's findings were justified and 
  should not be disturbed.</p>
<p>
  Analysis of arguments</p>
<p>
  [13] Orlando says that there was no foreseeability on its part that the failure 
  to use a vapour barrier would cause corrosion damage. Domtar did not inform 
  it of the presence of acids or inform it of the warning note in the Canadian 
  General Standards Board specification. Despite Domtar's awareness of the corrosion 
  potential, its brochure recommended a vapour barrier to protect the R value 
  of the insulation, not the steel deck. Domtar knew Orlando did not use vapour 
  barriers in its warehouse roofs. In effect, Domtar was dealing with a pre-existing 
  condition. Why, it is argued, should Orlando look behind the brochure? It is 
  also noted that Domtar made a claim in an action in the United States against 
  its supplier based on the corrosive potential of the insulation. Additionally, 
  subsequent to its sale to Orlando, Domtar made the use of a vapour barrier mandatory 
  in every phenolic foam installation.</p>
<p>
  [14] This appears to be a formidable argument in favour of Orlando, but there 
  are omissions from it which were persuasive to the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [15] To begin, the trial judge was clearly influenced by the failure of Orlando 
  to call witnesses to explain why vapour barriers were not used. He states: </p>
<p class="indent"> [123] No one involved in the design of these buildings was 
  called as a witness by the plaintiff, yet the plaintiff utilized the services 
  of its own architects and professional engineers in the design of these buildings. 
  Consequently, counsel were left with limited opportunity to cross-examine the 
  plaintiff's witnesses about Orlando's design decision to omit a vapour barrier.</p>
<p class="indent">[124] In 1995, Orlando changed its design policy concerning 
  vapour barriers and thereafter, they were installed in the warehouse or industrial 
  part of its buildings. The reason given by Mr. Turner was that it would give 
  the plaintiff greater flexibility in the uses to which a building could be put, 
  and they could build &quot;on spec&quot; without having to secure a tenant in 
  advance. However, it is to be noted that the plaintiff did not produce one single 
  document on the subject, be it a memorandum explaining the need for a change 
  in policy or a direction to those concerned that there had been a change in 
  policy. Nor did those responsible for this alleged change in policy testify. 
  The defence argues that an inference may be drawn from this. Counsel suggests 
  that by 1995, having cut corners and saved money by omitting vapour barriers, 
  it had become clear to the plaintiff that prudent design required their installation.</p>
<p>
  [16] This suggestion of cost saving is supported by Orlando's failure to even 
  consider vapour barriers for any preventative purpose. The trial judge found: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [125] As part of its sales approach, Domtar gave Orlando its &quot;Roofing Systems&quot; 
  brochure. More will be said about it below, but it included the following about 
  the need for vapour barriers: </p>
<p class="indent10"> Most conventionally insulated roofing assemblies require 
  a vapour retarder. It performs the vital function of preventing moisture vapour 
  within the interior atmosphere of the building from entering the roof insulation 
  and roof assembly &#133;</p>
<p class="indent10">Responsibility for the inclusion of a vapour retarder within 
  the roofing assembly rests with the design authority. The decision-making process 
  should include calculation of interior relative humidity, climatic conditions 
  and dew point.</p>
<p class="indent"> [126] The same information was provided in Domtar's &quot;Rx 
  Roof Insulation&quot; brochure. Mr. Turner of Orlando acknowledged that the 
  types of calculations referred to in the brochure were not done for the Coast 
  and Cooper buildings. He also agreed that they were not difficult calculations.</p>
<p  class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> [128] The plaintiff's witness, Richard Canon, an expert in 
  roofing and structural engineering, acknowledged that a roof designer takes 
  condensation into consideration, calculating the extent to which there will 
  be condensation in the roof, the concern being potential corrosion of the fasteners 
  and the deck, and ridging of and damage to the membrane.</p>
<p class="indent">[129] I am satisfied that the plaintiff gave no thought to the 
  need for vapour barriers in these roofs.</p>
<p>
  [17] The next logical step in the analysis is to determine if this casual approach 
  to the potential for condensation of water could lead to the damage without 
  the presence of formic acid in the insulation. The trial judge made a positive 
  finding on the evidence before him that galvanized fasteners, which could not 
  have been affected by acid, were corroded. He stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> Fastener Corrosion</p>
<p class="indent">[141] There were fastener plates taken from the Coast roof that 
  were corroded to the point of perforation (the plates had three or four times 
  the amount of galvanization than that on the deck). Others were significantly 
  corroded. It was also demonstrated that several fasteners (screws) were more 
  heavily corroded in the area where they passed through the fibreboard than where 
  they passed through the foam. It was also established in evidence that there 
  were instances where the fasteners and plates were significantly corroded, but 
  where the underlying deck was not corroded. The defence argues that this evidence 
  (acknowledged by Dr. Slater) shows that corrosion mechanisms were at work which 
  had nothing to do with the insulation. I agree.</p>
<p class="indent">[142] The defence argues that the plaintiff's theories cannot 
  explain how acids from the insulation could corrode fasteners above the fibreboard 
  and yet not corrode the deck below. Dr. Slater's theory of the &quot;off-gassing&quot; 
  of formic acid could not possibly account for this. Fibreboard has been used 
  on roofs for decades as an insulation. It has been placed directly against steel 
  decking. However, nobody maintains that fibreboard is responsible for corroding 
  fasteners or steel decks. Any such problem would be attributed, rightly, to 
  the presence of water. I agree with this analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">[143] Mr. Canon, for the plaintiff, acknowledged in cross-examination 
  that fasteners which he was shown had been stripped of their epoxy protection 
  by severe corrosion, and this was observable in the part of the fastener shank 
  that passed through the fibreboard and was above the foam. He acknowledged that 
  this was attributable to the presence of water.</p>
<p>
  [18] Further, the evidence was clear that there was no corrosion over the office 
  portions of the Cooper and Coastal buildings where vapour barriers were installed.</p>
<p>
  [19] The trial judge identifies other mechanisms for corrosion by water in urban 
  atmospheric conditions: </p>
<p class="indent"> [105] The defence submits that it would be highly unreasonable 
  to ascribe the blame for corrosion to a low level of formates because they somehow 
  make the water highly conductive. There was no evidence of that. However, there 
  was evidence that there are other substances that could increase the conductivity 
  of water on the deck. The Maxxam Laboratory Report shows the presence of fluoride, 
  chloride and orthophosphates and the Ontario Power Generation report shows ascetic 
  acid and chlorides. According to Dr. Rudin, these substances do not come from 
  the insulation. It must be presumed that there are other substances in the corrosion 
  products that have not been analyzed. Again, the onus is on the plaintiff to 
  do this.[106] Dr. Scepanovic testified about atmospheric corrosion. She said 
  that in urban and industrial atmospheres, the mere absorption of carbon dioxide 
  results in a pH of 4 or 4.5 in any water and that there is enough conductivity 
  from that alone to cause corrosion. She said that hydrogen sulfide is &quot;all 
  over the place&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [20] Moreover, subsequent to the events in issue, there was evidence of corrosion 
  to other Domtar roofs where the insulation was fibreglass. The trial judge recounts: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [122] Domtar, through its own inquiries, discovered that in 1998 the plaintiff 
  had replaced approximately 30,000 sq. ft. of the roof on its Norampac building 
  in Mississauga. The building was about ten years old when the roof had to be 
  removed and the deck scraped and painted. The cause was corrosion due to excessive 
  condensation. The insulation on the Norampac building had been fibreglass and 
  there had been no vapour barrier. Mr. Turner of Orlando acknowledged that there 
  were other roofs that Orlando had to repair because of condensation problems 
  with insulation other than phenolic foam.</p>
<p>[21] Ferrier J. summarizes his view as to the standard of care in the industry 
  in these terms: </p>
<p class="indent"> Standard of Care</p>
<p class="indent">[134] The plaintiff argues that the standard of care in the 
  industry in 1990 and 1991 was to omit a vapour barrier. I disagree. While it 
  was established that 95% of warehouses in the Toronto area did not contain vapour 
  barriers, the literature, industry publications, building codes, and other evidence 
  in this case make it clear that at that time, the design authority had to consider 
  whether a vapour barrier was necessary. When doing so, the designers had to 
  take into account not only the design elements of the building, but also the 
  atmospheric conditions, the dew point calculations and, significantly, the use 
  to which the building would be put. Orlando did none of this.</p>
<p>
  [22] Ferrier J.'s conclusion on the effect of moisture in the roofs was: </p>
<p class="indent"> [321] The presence of moisture in the roof assemblies was by 
  far the greatest contributor to the corrosion in each roof. Very large amounts 
  of water were present in Coast over a period of ten years. The effect of the 
  condensation was the most significant factor in the corrosion process.</p>
<p class="indent">[322] While the effect in Cooper appears to be of a significantly 
  lesser degree, here too moisture and condensation were the major problems.</p>
<p class="indent">[323] It is clear that where a vapour barrier was installed 
  with the insulation, there was no problem - witness the office roofs.</p>
<p class="indent">[324] The Coast warehouse had no vapour barrier, was heavily 
  humidified and had significant air leakage. It was heavily corroded.</p>
<p class="indent">[325] The Cooper warehouse had no vapour barrier, was generally 
  well ventilated and had obvious signs of condensation, but where the foam boards 
  lay flat against the deck, there was virtually no corrosion. Rather, there was 
  corrosion only at the joints where condensation had occurred.</p>
<p class="indent">[326] I conclude on the evidence that had Orlando installed 
  a proper air/vapour barrier in each warehouse roof, as required by the Ontario 
  Building Code, there would have been no corrosion.</p>
<p>
  [23] In dealing with Domtar's liability, the trial found that it failed in its 
  duty to warn that, if not installed with a vapour barrier, its product had the 
  capacity to contribute to corrosion of the steel deck. Formates were found on 
  both steel roofs, indicating that formic acid had been involved in the corrosion 
  process. Thus, the failure to warn was causally connected to the damage. He 
  also found that, by omitting any warning, Domtar had made a negligent misrepresentation 
  as to the suitability of phenolic foam for use over a steel deck without a vapour 
  barrier. He further found that Domtar knew or ought to have known, by testing 
  and analysis, of the corrosive potential in the presence of moisture.</p>
<p>
  [24] Ferrier J. then concludes: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [421] Furthermore, as I have indicated, I accept Dr. Rudin's analysis of the 
  corrosive power of the foam. I agree with his opinion, without hesitation, that 
  the foam had a very limited ability to contribute to the corrosion. However, 
  as I have indicated, it is my view that even though the contribution was slight, 
  the attack on the galvaneal protective cover significantly reduced the deck's 
  capacity to withstand the corrosive effect of moisture.</p>
<p  class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> [423] In addition, Dr. Rudin's opinion, which I accept, was 
  that if all of the formic acid leached out of the foam, it would consume only 
  80 pounds of steel in a 1,000,000 pound deck.</p>
<p class="indent">[424] The defendant argues that if Domtar is found to have contributed 
  to the damages, its contribution is de minimis and it raises the defence of 
  de minimis non curat lex. I disagree that the contribution was de minimis. The 
  deterioration of the deck's galvaneal protective cover, caused in part by the 
  acid in the defendant's product, contributed materially to the corrosion of 
  the steel. However, moisture was by far the major player in the corrosion and 
  the fault for that is the plaintiff's.</p>
<p>
  [25] The principal thrust of the appellant's argument is that it was not foreseeable 
  to it that the failure to use a vapour barrier could cause corrosion. Domtar 
  sold its product with knowledge of its acidic content and with knowledge that 
  Orlando did not use vapour barriers except over office premises. On Orlando's 
  successful prior experience with fibreglass how could it have foreseen the problem? 
  It was pointed out that the trial judge nowhere refers to Orlando foreseeing 
  the problem.</p>
<p>
  [26] A beginning to the answer to this argument is found in the trial judge's 
  observation at para. 420 of his reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [420] I am satisfied that the reason the plaintiff had not had many instances 
  of corrosion using fibreglass insulation was that the fibreglass was air and 
  water permeable, allowing for drying of the roof assembly. The plaintiff failed 
  to consider the effect of a rigid board foam insulation on the drying process 
  within the roof assembly.</p>
<p>
  [27] The essence of the reasons, taken as a whole, is that moisture caused the 
  damage, modestly accelerated by the acid. It was Orlando's obligation to design 
  the buildings appropriately and it knew of the potential for moisture damage, 
  as evidenced by the use of vapour barriers over the offices. There was less 
  humidity in the warehouse areas, but apparently there was still enough humidity 
  to cause moisture damage. If water caused the damage, then it was appropriate 
  for the trial judge to look to Orlando for an innocent explanation. The absence 
  of such an explanation was properly noted. The inference the trial judge drew 
  was that Orlando failed to consider the switch from a permeable to an impermeable 
  insulative material, an implicit finding that it was negligent in doing so. 
  I have no difficulty in reading a finding of foreseeability of consequential 
  damage into that failure to consider permeability. Once it is acknowledged that 
  moisture was the predominant cause of the damage, and was a competent cause 
  of the damage without the involvement of acid, the party who produced that moisture 
  may justifiably be expected to explain that the presence of moisture was not 
  due to its negligence.</p>
<p>
  [28] In Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd., [1997] 
  3 S.C.R. 1210 (S.C.C.) McLachlin J. set out the definition of contributory negligence 
  at p. 1254 in these terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I accept the defendants' submissions. The test for contributory negligence was 
  summarized by Denning L.J. in Jones v. Livox Quarries Ld., [1952] 2 Q.B. 608 
  (C.A.), at p. 615: </p>
<p class="indent10">
  Although contributory negligence does not depend on a duty of care, it does 
  depend on foreseeability. Just as actionable negligence requires the foreseeability 
  of harm to others, so contributory negligence requires the foreseeability of 
  harm to oneself. A person is guilty of contributory negligence if he ought reasonably 
  to have foreseen that, if he did not act as a reasonable, prudent man, he might 
  be hurt himself; and in his reckonings he must take into account the possibility 
  of others being careless.</p>
<p>
  [29] In my view, the evidence amply supports the conclusion that Orlando was 
  not reasonable in simply assuming that an impermeable insulation board could 
  be safely used without a vapour barrier in the face of all of the warnings (if 
  it needed a warning) as to the effect of moisture on steel. It took no account 
  of the possibility that Domtar might be careless. That is the essence of the 
  trial judge's reasoning, and I agree with his conclusion that Orlando must share 
  responsibility.</p>
<p>
  [30] Orlando's further argument is that if it must share blame the trial judge 
  used the wrong approach to apportion that blame. He should have looked at degrees 
  of fault, not the extent of the damage caused.</p>
<p>
  [31] Section 3 of the Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1 reads: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In any action for damages that is founded upon the fault or negligence of the 
  defendant if fault or negligence is found on the part of the plaintiff that 
  contributed to the damages, the court shall apportion the damages in proportion 
  to the degree of fault or negligence found against the parties respectively.</p>
<p>
  [32] Orlando says that the fault of Domtar in selling a product known to contain 
  acids to a company known not to use vapour barriers, and putatively to assure 
  a sale, with no warning, is far more egregious than any fault to be ascribed 
  to Orlando. It was thus wrong to conclude that, since the impact of the acid 
  was minor, the damages should be at the same level. The greater fault should 
  be the measure of apportionment and the trial judge never gave this consideration.</p>
<p>
  [33] This argument has a superficial attraction until thought is given to a 
  fuller description of Domtar's fault or negligence. It was negligent in so conducting 
  itself that if Orlando failed to use a vapour barrier it was foreseeable that 
  its product could make a minor contribution to damage to the steel deck. By 
  paying a minor portion of the loss, its contribution is commensurate with its 
  negligence. It is to be remembered that there was very little formic acid content 
  in the phenolic foam, and corrosion occurred that could not have been caused 
  by acid in the most highly galvanized fasteners. I, therefore, put aside that 
  ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [34] A final ground of appeal was to urge that the allocation of contribution 
  to damages should be different as between the two buildings. There was evidence 
  that at typical temperatures condensation only occurs at or above 45 degrees 
  humidity. While the Coast building ranged around 45 degrees, the Cooper building 
  was maintained well below that level. Thus, Orlando says, the influence of acid 
  must have been higher in the building with less condensing moisture.</p>
<p>
  [35] The trial judge notes that the laying of the concrete floor in the Cooper 
  building, and the consequent release of moisture as the concrete cured, may 
  have lead to the corrosion. He also finds that both roofs required replacement 
  for safety reasons. He then assessed damages and allocates responsibility without 
  comment on this argument - no doubt because it was not put to him.</p>
<p>
  [36] This court should not speculate on fresh arguments dependant upon factual 
  findings we cannot make, and I would reject this ground of appeal. In any event, 
  it seems of dubious merit on the finding of the trial judge that condensation 
  was produced by the curing of the concrete.</p>
<p>
  Cross-appeal</p>
<p>
  [37] The cross-appeal contests the trial judge's finding that Domtar had a duty 
  to warn of the acidic content of its product, citing Hollis v. Dow Corning Corp., 
  [1995] 4 S.C.R. 634 for the proposition that the duty is restricted to inherently 
  dangerous products, which, Domtar says, phenolic foam is not.</p>
<p>
  [38] This is a redundant argument in light of Ferrier J.'s finding of negligence 
  independently of the warning issue. It is also answered by Domtar's own factum 
  in response to the appeal, reading from para. 64: &quot;The test for contributory 
  negligence is no different in a duty to warn case than in other cases. The task 
  of the Court remains to determine the causes of any damage and to apportion 
  liability amongst those who contributed to the damage.&quot; A duty to warn 
  may be only one facet of a general finding of negligence and does not change 
  the formula for allocating responsibility. I would therefore dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p> [39] I would dismiss the appeal and cross-appeal with costs on a partial indemnity 
  scale to the respondent for 90 per cent of an appropriate assessment, reduced 
  by reason of its lack of success on the cross-appeal. At the time of argument, 
  the trial judge had not awarded trial costs. He has now done so but has left 
  quantum open to be spoken to. We are told that there will be an appeal from 
  that disposition. From a reading of the reasons of Ferrier J. as to costs, I 
  see no need that any such appeal be before this panel, nor any reason to defer 
  fixing costs of the present appeal. The respondent may have two weeks to submit 
  an appropriate bill of costs with supporting material and the appellant may 
  have ten days thereafter to make submissions, followed by reply from the respondent 
  within four days.</p>
