<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Frances P. Kiteley of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, sitting without a jury, dated July 31, 2001.</p>
<p>
  LABROSSE J.A.:</p>
<p>
  [1] The husband and wife were married on November 1, 1991. They have two children: 
  Anastasia, born June 12, 1993 and Samantha, born March 31, 1995. The parties 
  separated on December 14, 1997 and were divorced on June 29, 1999. They resolved 
  the issues of custody and access before trial, and the remaining issues of equalization 
  of net family property and child and spousal support were tried before Kiteley 
  J.</p>
<p>
  [2] The wife appeals from the judgment of Kiteley J. on the grounds that the 
  trial judge erred: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1) when she allowed a debt owing by the husband to his mother 
  to be included in the husband's net family property for purposes of equalization; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">2) in the calculation of the parties' incomes for purposes of 
  special or extraordinary expenses for the children under s. 7 of the Federal 
  Child Support Guidelines.</p>
<p>
  [3] The husband cross-appeals on the grounds that the trial judge erred:</p>
<p class="indent"> 1) in requiring him to pay 50% of the realty taxes on the matrimonial 
  home between January 1, 1998 and the closing of the sale of the home; and </p>
<p class="indent">2) on the issue of the costs of the action. </p>
<p>
  The Debt</p>
<p>
  [4] With respect to the first ground of appeal, the debt alleged to be owed 
  by the husband to his mother is in the amount of $120,000.00, which the mother 
  unquestionably contributed to the acquisition of the matrimonial home for the 
  parties. The issue was whether the amount was a gift or a loan to the husband. 
  The trial judge heard considerable evidence on this issue. In her reasons, she 
  provided a detailed review of the evidence of the parties and other witnesses 
  and found that there was a valid subsisting debt owing by the husband to his 
  mother on valuation date. Consequently, she included the amount of the debt 
  in the calculation of the net family property of the husband. This finding of 
  the trial judge is amply supported by the evidence and there is no basis for 
  this court to interfere.</p>
<p>
  Section 7 Expenses</p>
<p>
  [5] The second ground of appeal relates to special or extraordinary expenses 
  for the support of a child that may be ordered under s. 7 of the Guidelines. 
  Section 7(2) provides that these expenses are to be shared by the spouses in 
  proportion to their respective incomes. </p>
<p>
  [6] For the purpose of the child support payable pursuant to the table amount 
  under the Guidelines, the trial judge determined that the husband's annual income 
  was $39,977.54 and that the child support payable was $557.00 per month for 
  the two children. </p>
<p>
  [7] When she addressed the special or extraordinary expenses, the trial judge 
  said at para. 87:</p>
<p class="indent"> Having found that Svitlana's income is $30,000.00, for purposes 
  of calculating the ratio for payment of the section 7 expenses, Schedule III 
  of the Guidelines directs that the child support is deducted from James' income 
  and added to Svitlana's income. As a result of that calculation, Svitlana's 
  income for the ratio is $36,684.00 and James' income is $33,293.00.</p>
<p>
  [8] Although both counsel are in agreement, for the purpose of this appeal, 
  that child support should not have been deducted from or added to the parents' 
  incomes for the purpose of determining s. 7 expenses, it may be helpful for 
  this court to pronounce itself on this issue which has to be frequently addressed 
  by trial judges.</p>
<p> [9] The few cases that have considered the issue of the calculation of income 
  for the purpose of determining payment of s. 7 expenses have reached different 
  results. See e.g.: Peltz v. Peltz, [2000] O.T.C. 732 (Sup. Ct.); Moss v. Moss 
  (1997), 159 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 1 (S.C.); Whittle v. Clements, [1998] N.J. 
  No. 140 (U.F.C.); Magee v. Magee (1997), 159 Sask. R. 223; Prince Edward Island 
  (Director of Maintenance Enforcement) v. Skinner, [2000] P.E.I.J. No. 29 (S.C.(T.D.)). 
  None of these cases has provided an analysis to explain or justify the particular 
  results that were reached. On the other hand, family law commentators have generally 
  expressed the view that child support is not deducted from or included in the 
  parents' incomes for the purpose of determining the payment of s. 7 expenses. 
  See, e.g., P.M. Epstein, &quot;Child Support Guidelines Legislation: An Overview&quot; 
  online: Joel Miller's Family Law Centre &lt;http://www.familylawcentre.com/ccoverview1.html&gt; 
  (date accessed: 16 April 2003); J.D. Payne, Child Support in Canada, 3d ed. 
  (QUICKLAW, 2001), online: QL (PDCS).</p>
<p>
  [10] The Guidelines do not, as stated by the trial judge, direct that the child 
  support payable by the husband be deducted from his income and added to the 
  income of the wife for the purpose of calculating the ratio for payment of the 
  s. 7 expenses.</p>
<p>
  [11] On the contrary, Schedule III of the Guidelines is silent on the issue 
  of child support in calculating income for the purpose of determining special 
  or extraordinary expenses under s. 7. However, the Schedule does specifically 
  mention the deduction of spousal support for this purpose. Subsection 3(2) states:</p>
<p class="indent"> Special or extraordinary expenses</p>
<p class="indent">(2) To calculate income for the purpose of determining an amount 
  under section 7 of these Guidelines, deduct the spousal support paid to the 
  other spouse.</p>
<p>
  [12] This provision directs that spousal support be deducted from the payor's 
  income (and by implication correspondingly be included in the payee's income) 
  in calculating income for determining s. 7 payments. This is in contrast to 
  how income is calculated for the purpose of determining basic child support 
  under the table amount, where spousal support is not included. The express mention 
  of spousal support in calculating s. 7 expenses necessarily implies that child 
  support is purposely excluded from the determination of income for this purpose. 
  This is a logical distinction given that spousal support goes to a parent's 
  ability to contribute to s. 7 expenses whereas child support does not.</p>
<p>
  [13] Moreover, it does not follow that the basic child support payment derived 
  from the table amount be separated from s. 7 expenses. Section 7 expenses are 
  merely special or extraordinary expenses that are determined to be additional 
  costs of raising a child that are not incorporated in the table amounts. This 
  is the reason they are characterized as special or extraordinary - they are 
  outside of the ordinary expenses contemplated by the figures calculated in the 
  table. However, they are still part of child support.</p>
<p>
  [14] Given that s. 7 expenses are added to the base amount of child support 
  provided for by the table to determine the total amount of child support payable, 
  it does not follow that the base amount should be separated from the s. 7 expenses. 
  Nor does it follow that the amount of child support payable according to the 
  table should form part of the income of the custodial parent for the purpose 
  of completing the child support determination under s. 7. The inclusion of this 
  income would be particularly problematic given that s. 7 expenses are those 
  that go beyond the ordinary expenses contemplated by the table and therefore 
  should not be indicative of the ability of the recipient of child support to 
  contribute to extraordinary expenses.</p>
<p>
  [15] Finally, if Parliament had intended for child support payments to be a 
  separate consideration in calculating income for s. 7 expenses, it would have 
  expressly provided for this as it did in the case of spousal support payments. 
</p>
<p>
  [16] Section 7 expenses form part of the overall child support determination 
  and should be calculated (when spousal support is not applicable) on the basis 
  of the non custodial parent's income used to determine the child support payable 
  under the table. By the same token, the parent receiving the support on behalf 
  of the child (not for his or her personal benefit) should not have this amount 
  reflected as part of her own income for the purpose of determining her ability 
  to contribute to the extraordinary expenses of the child. In effect this would 
  be a mischaracterization and, more specifically, an overstatement of the parent's 
  ability to contribute. This would leave open the possibility, as exists in this 
  case, that one spouse would be severely disadvantaged in the determination of 
  the s. 7 expenses.</p>
<p>
  [17] In my view, counsel were correct in agreeing, at the opening of the hearing 
  of the appeal, that child support should not have been deducted from the husband's 
  income and added to the wife's income for the purpose of determining the payment 
  of s. 7 expenses. Counsel are also in agreement that on the basis of the parties' 
  incomes, subject to minor adjustments, the ratio for payment of the s. 7 special 
  or extraordinary expenses should be 57% for the husband and 43% for the wife.</p>
<p>
  Property Taxes</p>
<p>
  [18] In the cross-appeal, the husband questions the disposition by the trial 
  judge of the property taxes on the matrimonial home. The trial judge ordered 
  that the home be sold in accordance with the Minutes of Settlement. The husband 
  argues that the trial judge was in error in ordering him to pay 50% of the property 
  taxes which, he maintains, were properly the responsibility of the wife who 
  was residing in the home with the children of the marriage.</p>
<p>
  [19] The trial judge reviewed considerable evidence relating to this issue. 
  She noted that the Minutes of Settlement in a related action, executed by the 
  parties on January 29,1998, referred to the typical expenses associated with 
  accommodation, except for realty taxes. An interim order dated July 6, 1999 
  contained no reference to realty taxes. She also noted that both parties remained 
  joint owners of the matrimonial home. She concluded that, in the absence of 
  a clear indication by either party in their Minutes of Settlement or by the 
  court in the interim order, the taxes were the equal responsibility of both 
  parties between January 1, 1998 and the date of closing. I see no error in this 
  conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [20] There are two other factors which militate against the position of the 
  husband on this issue. Firstly, on January 18, 2002, on a motion by the wife, 
  Chief Justice McMurtry stayed the sale of the matrimonial home ordered by the 
  trial judge pending the hearing of the wife's appeal. Having won that motion, 
  the wife should not be penalized for the delay. Secondly, and more importantly 
  in my view, the husband will share equally in the equity. There is no unfairness 
  in holding him responsible for one-half of the realty taxes. The house should 
  now be sold forthwith.</p>
<p>
  Costs of Action</p>
<p>
  [21] The other issue raised by the husband in the cross-appeal relates to the 
  disposition of costs of the action by the trial judge. The trial judge ordered 
  the husband to pay the costs for the four days of trial and one day of costs 
  submissions on a party-and-party basis. The husband argues that the trial judge 
  erred in failing to award him party-and-party costs to January 8, 2001 and solicitor-and-client 
  costs thereafter. </p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge noted that the husband had made an offer of settlement 
  in advance of the anticipated trial date and that the judgment was more favourable 
  to the husband than was his offer. She also noted that the wife had made an 
  offer which was delivered minutes before the trial started and that the judgment 
  was &quot;materially less favourable&quot; than was her offer. </p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge recognized the importance of parties making early and reasonable 
  offers (as an incentive to the settlement of litigation). She also recognized 
  that there are circumstances where a party who has made reasonable attempts 
  to settle and who has recovered a judgment more favourable than his/her offer 
  should not be entitled to the costs of the action. She thought that this was 
  such a case. In her view, the secrecy associated with the creation of the debt 
  between the husband and his mother created a situation where &quot;compromise 
  and resolution were well nigh impossible. For that the husband must take responsibility.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [24] However, she also found that the wife should have been more amenable to 
  the husband's offer to settle. Although this was a case where the wife should 
  not be punished for having her day in court when it was the actions of the husband 
  which created the circumstances, she ought not to be rewarded with an order 
  for costs when her offer to settle was made as the trial was scheduled to begin 
  and was less favourable than the judgment. In the context of her reasons, I 
  conclude that the trial judge meant that the wife was not entitled to an order 
  for her full costs.</p>
<p>
  [25] In these circumstances, as I have said, the trial judge ordered the husband 
  to pay costs for the four days of trial and the day that counsel made submissions 
  with respect to costs, on a party-and-party basis. </p>
<p>
  [26] In my view, the trial judge considered all the relevant factors in arriving 
  at a determination of costs pursuant to s. 131 of the Courts of Justice Act 
  and Rules 49 and 57. Having in mind the wide discretion afforded to trial judges 
  when dealing with costs, I am not persuaded that she improperly exercised her 
  discretion on this issue.</p>
<p>
  [27] In the result, I would allow the appeal with respect to the s. 7 expenses 
  and order that the proportion of payment be 57% for the husband and 43% for 
  the wife. In all other respects, I would dismiss the appeal. I would dismiss 
  the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  Costs of Appeal and Cross-Appeal</p>
<p>
  [28] With respect to the costs of the appeal and cross-appeal, success is divided. 
  The major part of the appeal dealt with the $120,000.00 loan and the husband 
  was successful on that issue. On the other hand, although the issue of the s. 
  7 expenses was conceded by the husband, this court only became aware of this 
  concession at the beginning of the hearing of the appeal. This is an important 
  and continuing benefit for the wife. In addition, she was successful in having 
  the cross-appeal dismissed. In my view, success was equally divided and I would 
  make no order as to costs. </p>
