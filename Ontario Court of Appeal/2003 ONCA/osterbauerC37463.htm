<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice B. P. Wright dated December 13, 2001.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT :</p>
<p>[1] The appellant, Ash Temple Limited, appeals from the trial judge's award 
  of damages to the respondent, George E. Osterbauer, for the wrongful termination 
  of his employment. The appellant raises a number of grounds of appeal in relation 
  to the trial judge's findings at trial. However, the main ground of appeal concerns 
  the conduct of the trial. The appellant contends that it was denied the opportunity 
  to fairly present its defence and counterclaim as a result of the trial judge's 
  premature determination of the merits of the case and his numerous interventions 
  in the process. </p> <p>
  [2] The test for reasonable apprehension of bias is well-established. It was 
  reiterated recently by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. S. (R.D.) (1997), 
  118 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.) as being that set out by de Grandpr&eacute; J. 
  in Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 
  369:</p> 
<p class="indent"> &#133; the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable 
  one, held by reasonable and right-minded persons, applying themselves to the 
  question and obtaining thereon the required information.... [T]hat test is &quot;what 
  would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically -- 
  and having thought the matter through -- conclude. Would he think that it is 
  more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, 
  would not decide fairly.</p>
<p>[3] The Supreme Court in R.D.S. also reiterated (at para. 99) the well-established 
  principle that, &quot;if actual or apprehended bias arises from a judge's words 
  or conduct, then the judge has exceeded his or her jurisdiction. This excess 
  of jurisdiction can be remedied by an application to the presiding judge for 
  disqualification if the proceedings are still underway, or by appellate review 
  of the judge's decision. In the context of appellate review, &#133; the conclusion 
  that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias will ordinarily lead inexorably 
  to the decision that a new trial must be held.&quot;</p> <p>
  [4] Regrettably, we must conclude upon review of the record that the trial judge's 
  conduct did in fact give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. Consequently, 
  there must be a new trial. Our reasons can be stated briefly.</p> <p>
  [5] In light of our conclusion, we find it neither necessary nor advisable to 
  set out the facts beyond describing the main issues between the parties. </p> <p>
  [6] The respondent was employed by the appellant from January 1, 1994 until 
  the end of April 2000. It was his position at trial that he was constructively 
  dismissed from his employment when in April 2000 the appellant for the first 
  time sought repayment from him of commissions that he had been paid over several 
  years. The disagreement between the parties was whether under the terms of his 
  employment, the respondent was obliged to repay any excess draw over earned 
  commissions. The claim for the over draw in commissions formed part of the appellant's 
  counterclaim. </p> <p>
  [7] The parties had also been involved in a joint venture that had failed, resulting 
  in a considerable loss. The respondent alleged that after the loss occurred, 
  the respondent had agreed and, as a consequence, was obligated to compensate 
  the appellant for 10% of the loss. This claim also formed part of the counterclaim. 
  </p> <p>
  [8] In his oral reasons, delivered at the conclusion of the trial, the trial 
  judge held that the respondent had been constructively dismissed. He found that 
  at the time of his dismissal, the respondent was earning a guaranteed monthly 
  income consisting of his full salary and full draw on commissions without need 
  for repayment. He held that the appropriate notice period was eight months, 
  and added three months because of the conduct of the employer. After taking 
  into account employment income earned by the respondent in November and December 
  of 2000 as mitigation, the trial judge awarded the respondent damages for wrongful 
  termination of his employment. He dismissed the counterclaim for unearned commissions 
  on the ground that he had already found that the respondent was not required 
  to repay any of his monthly advance commissions. He also dismissed the counterclaim 
  with respect to the loss on the business venture.</p> <p>
  [9] The appellant relies on two statements made by the trial judge early in 
  the trial as well as numerous interventions throughout the trial in support 
  of his contention that the trial judge had pre-judged the merits of the case 
  before the appellant had any chance to present its case. He submits that this 
  is most apparent from the following exchange which took place at the conclusion 
  of the examination-in chief of the first witness, Mr. Osterbauer: </p> 
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: Okay. This case should be settled.</p>
<p class="indent">MR. TIGHE : Many cases ought to be, sir.THE COURT: But 
  this one especially. I think the only live issue is what is the amount of proper 
  notice. That shouldn't be too hard to resolve.</p>
<p class="indent">MR. TIGHE: Well, sir, I think it would be useful to 
  hear the rest of the case.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: I'll hear the rest of the case. All I'm saying 
  it seems to me from what - - I think if you just step back from this case and 
  say and ask yourself what is the probable likely result of this case? What it 
  probably comes down to, what is the appropriate notice?</p>
<p>
  [10] We agree with the appellant that the trial judge's comment on the probable 
  result of the trial was improper. Although the trial judge was probably attempting 
  to assist counsel, the comment suggested a pre-judgment on the issue of liability 
  and the counterclaim at a point in the trial when the cross-examination of the 
  plaintiff had not even commenced. Counsel for the respondent fairly concedes 
  that this exchange is problematic but submits that the trial judge was merely 
  expressing a preliminary tentative view of the evidence. The problem raised 
  by this exchange was compounded by what followed. </p> <p>
  [11] The next exchange that is relied upon heavily by the appellant occurred 
  during the course of the cross-examination of Mr. Osterbauer. Counsel for the 
  appellant was interrupted during the course of questioning Mr. Osterbauer on 
  his position with respect to the alleged obligation to repay 10% of the loss 
  resulting from the joint business venture. The following exchange took place: 
  </p> 
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: Do you recall what I said yesterday what 
  I thought to be the live issue in this case.</p>
<p class="indent">MR. TIGHE: I recall it vividly, Your Honour. </p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: Maybe this one is D-E-A-D.</p>
<p>
  [12] Counsel for the respondent again fairly concedes that this exchange is 
  unfortunate. He submits however, that it was open to the trial judge to express 
  a tentative view on the merits of the counterclaim given the absence of any 
  documentary support for it. </p> <p>
  [13] It is noteworthy that the appellant's counterclaim for 10% of the loss 
  was based on an alleged oral agreement and that, at this early stage of the 
  trial, the defence had not yet opened its case on the counterclaim. </p> <p>
  [14] Given these exchanges, we must unfortunately agree with the appellant's 
  submissions that the trial judge appeared, in effect, to have pre-judged both 
  the issue of liability on the claim for constructive dismissal, and the merits 
  of the counterclaim before the plaintiff had finished giving his testimony. 
  This appearance of pre-judgment was further apparent from another comment by 
  the trial judge towards the end of the trial when counsel for the appellant 
  was examining a witness in chief about whether the appellant was prepared to 
  reinstate the respondent. The trial judge said: </p> 
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: Counsel, you don't listen when I say what 
  are the live issues in this case, and if counsel will recall I think the first 
  day of this trial I tried to persuade both counsel to realize that I thought 
  the only live issue in this case was what? </p>
<p>[15] Counsel for the appellant relies on a number of interventions by the trial 
  judge in support of his further contention that the trial judge improperly curtailed 
  his cross-examination of witnesses on relevant issues that went to the core 
  of the litigation. The respondent, on the other hand, submits that the interventions 
  in question were warranted given the tenuous nature of many of these issues. 
  He submits further that the appellant was not prevented from fully canvassing 
  the issues in question. </p> <p>
  [16] With respect, we disagree with the respondent's position. While some of 
  the trial judge's interventions, had they occurred in isolation, could be interpreted 
  simply as mistakes on his part about the relevance of the evidence, we must 
  conclude otherwise having regard to their context and cumulative effect. In 
  our view, the issues being canvassed by counsel at the relevant times could 
  only be considered as irrelevant by the trial judge if indeed he had already 
  concluded against the position advanced by the appellant. Furthermore, we are 
  satisfied that the appellant was effectively prevented from fully canvassing 
  some of the issues by reason of the trial judge's repeated characterization 
  of the subject-matter as irrelevant. It is noteworthy that some of the matters 
  that counsel for the appellant was prevented from exploring further on the basis 
  that they were irrelevant later formed part of the basis of the trial judge's 
  ultimate findings in his reasons for judgment. </p> <p>
  [17] We are satisfied that the cumulative effect of the exchanges and the interventions 
  relied upon by the appellant meet the test for reasonable apprehension of bias. 
  An informed observer, viewing the matter realistically and practically, would 
  more likely than not conclude that the trial judge, whether consciously or unconsciously, 
  would not decide the issues fairly.</p> <p>
  [18] In light of our conclusion on this ground of appeal, it is neither necessary 
  nor advisable to consider the additional grounds of appeal.</p> <p>
  [19] We would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the judgment and order a 
  new trial. On consent of the parties, any award in respect of the costs of the 
  first trial and the appeal is left at the discretion of the presiding judge 
  at the second trial. If an award is made in respect of the costs of this appeal, 
  those costs are fixed at $5,000.</p>
