<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the appellant, Ken Thomson, is entitled to raise the argument 
  that the motion judge erred in concluding that Stewart House held the monies 
  in trust even though Stewart House itself has not continued its appeal after 
  its bankruptcy. The conclusion of the motion judge that there was a trust affected 
  the appellant's interest and is a conclusion that is as much against the appellant 
  as it is against Stewart House. The appellant is therefore entitled to appeal 
  that conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [2] In our view, on the record before him, the motion judge erred holding that 
  the amounts owing to the respondent were impressed with a trust. In his reasons, 
  the motion judge misconstrued the legal effect of the provision in the agreement 
  relating to the payments by Stewart House to the respondent. </p>
<p>
  [3] The motion judge said the following:</p>
<p class="indent"> Upon sale of the product, Stewart House acquired a contractual 
  right to appropriate to itself 25% of the sale price as a selling agent's commission 
  for the product. Upon appropriating that 25% of the sale price to itself, the 
  remaining funds or net proceeds of sale which represented the product remained 
  the property of the plaintiff. </p>
<p>
  [4] We do not think that the agreement, properly interpreted, means that the 
  net proceeds of sale &quot;remained the property of the respondent&quot;. Rather, 
  the agreement provided that Stewart House was contractually obligated to pay 
  to the respondent 75% of the amount invoiced to purchasers. Payments to the 
  respondent did not depend on receipt of payment by Stewart House. The risk of 
  non-payment was assumed by Stewart House not by the respondent. Indeed, there 
  was a specific provision in the agreement to this effect.</p>
<p>
  [5] This arrangement for payment to the respondent is inconsistent with the 
  notion that the proceeds received from sales of the games were impressed with 
  a trust in favour of the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [6] Another factor which points away from the existence of a trust is that the 
  agreement made no provision for the segregation of the funds received by Stewart 
  House from the sale of the games. </p>
<p>
  [7] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the judgment as against the appellant, 
  Thomson, is set aside and the motion for summary judgment is dismissed. The 
  costs of the appeal are fixed on a partial indemnity basis in the amount of 
  $12,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T. </p>
