<p>On appeal from the judgment entered by Justice Joseph M. W. Donohue of the 
  Superior Court of Justice on January 18, 2001.</p>
<p>
  BORINS JA: </p>
<p>
  [1] This appeal arises from a jury's assessment of non-pecuniary, or general, 
  damages in the amount of $500,000, subsequently adjusted by the trial judge 
  to $274,000 to conform with the cap or limit imposed on general damages by the 
  Supreme Court of Canada. Although the appellants say that the trial judge was 
  correct in principle in not accepting the jury's assessment, adjusting it to 
  the upper limit of the cap and rejecting the respondent's motion to amend the 
  amount claimed in his statement of claim to conform with the jury's assessment, 
  they contend that the damages as adjusted cannot stand. They say that the damages 
  are unreasonable and perverse as the respondent's injuries are not so severe 
  as to attract an award at the upper limit of the cap. The appellants suggest 
  that the jury's $500,000 assessment may have been influenced by a passage in 
  the trial judge's instructions on general damages, which the appellants submit 
  amounted to a misdirection. I agree with the appellants that the award as adjusted 
  cannot stand and would allow their appeal.</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent has cross-appealed from the trial judge's refusal to amend 
  his claim to conform with the jury's $500,000 assessment of his general damages. 
  He submits that there are special circumstances in this case that justify an 
  award in excess of the cap and contends that the trial judge erred in adjusting 
  the award to conform with the cap. I would dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [3] On January 17, 1994, at the age of seventeen, the respondent Jared Padfield 
  was involved in a motor vehicle accident. He was a passenger on the back bench 
  seat of a minivan when it collided with a transport trailer owned by the appellant 
  L.M. Transport Ltd. (&quot;LMT&quot;) and operated by the appellant Leonard 
  Martin. As a result of the accident, Mr. Padfield suffered a perforated bowel 
  and a fracture of the L2 vertebra in his back. He was hospitalized for 15 days, 
  during which he underwent surgery first on his bowel, and later on his fractured 
  vertebra. The repair of the fracture involved the fusion of the L2 and L3 vertebrae.</p>
<p>
  [4] Mr. Padfield and his parents brought an action against LMT and Mr. Martin, 
  as well as the owner and operator of a third vehicle, seeking $100,000 in damages 
  (later amended to $250,000) and making claims under the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. F.3. The action against the third vehicle defendants was dismissed 
  on consent. Liability for the accident was admitted by the appellants and a 
  trial was held before a jury for the purpose of assessing non-pecuniary damages.</p>
<p>
  [5] In addition to testimony about pain and suffering endured by Mr. Padfield 
  and about the emotional and psychological effect of the injuries, evidence was 
  led at trial concerning the prospects that Mr. Padfield might have had as an 
  elite volleyball player but for the accident. At the time of the accident, Mr. 
  Padfield was a competitive player, and had devoted considerable time to the 
  sport both in high school and at a local volleyball club. It was his pre-accident 
  goal to play for the Canadian national volleyball team. After the accident, 
  his playing ability was diminished. He failed to obtain an athletic scholarship 
  at the American universities he contacted after the accident, and gave up playing 
  competitive volleyball in his second year at the University of Western Ontario. 
  He ultimately went to teacher's college, and became a teacher of Grade 7 and 
  8 students and a volleyball coach in Huntsville, Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [6] The defence theory was that the most likely cause of Mr. Padfield's lower 
  back pain and of his inability to pursue his volleyball career was a progressive 
  spinal condition that was present in its initial stage prior to the accident. 
  Their position was that Mr. Padfield had recovered from his injuries in a relatively 
  short time following the accident and that any ongoing pain or disability resulted 
  from the pre-existing condition and was unrelated in any material way to the 
  accident. Mr. Padfield's position was that the spinal condition was asymptomatic 
  prior to the accident, and would probably have remained that way if not for 
  the fusion required as a result of the injuries that he sustained in the accident. 
  His counsel advanced the theory that even if Mr. Padfield's condition would 
  probably have become symptomatic in any event, he would have been able to play 
  out his entire volleyball career but for the injuries caused by the appellants.</p>
<p>
  [7] Defence counsel suggested figures to the jury ranging from $30,000 to $80,000 
  as an appropriate assessment of non-pecuniary damages. Neither Mr. Padfield's 
  counsel nor the trial judge suggested figures to the jury. At the end of a 10-day 
  trial, the jury returned its assessment of Mr. Padfield's damages. To everyone's 
  surprise, the jurors assessed Mr. Padfield's non-pecuniary damages in the amount 
  of $500,000 for pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life and loss of amenities 
  of life. Mr. Padfield's counsel moved for judgment in accordance with this assessment, 
  and in doing so sought permission to amend the amount claimed in the statement 
  of claim from $250,000 to $500,000. Because the jury's award exceeded the cap 
  for general non-pecuniary damages established by the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in the 1978 &quot;Andrews trilogy&quot; (Andrews v. Grand &amp; Toy Alberta 
  Ltd., [1978] 2 S.C.R. 229; Thornton v. Prince George School Board, [1978] 2 
  S.C.R. 267; Arnold v. Teno, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 287), which, the parties agreed, 
  as adjusted by inflation stood at approximately $274,000 at the time of the 
  trial, the trial judge asked for written submissions from the parties on how 
  he should proceed in the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [8] Counsel for LMT argued that the jury's assessment could not stand because 
  it exceeded the Andrews cap, and requested that the trial judge substitute his 
  own assessment on the basis that the jury verdict was perverse. Mr. Padfield's 
  counsel argued that the cap did not apply in the circumstances of this case, 
  and that the statement of claim should be amended to permit judgment to be entered 
  for the amount assessed by the jury. He submitted that the cap was based on 
  the proposition that because plaintiffs receive compensation for all pecuniary 
  aspects of their injuries, the purpose of a general damages award is therefore 
  limited to compensating non-pecuniary loss. Since Mr. Padfield's circumstances 
  meant he would receive virtually no compensation for pecuniary loss in this 
  case by operation of s. 267.1 of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8 (also 
  referred to as Bill 164), the rationale for imposing a cap on general damages 
  did not exist here.</p>
<p>
  [9] In a written endorsement dated January 18, 2001, reported at [2001] O.J. 
  No. 5938, the trial judge rejected Mr. Padfield's argument. In doing so, he 
  applied the decision of this court in Payne v. Alb (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 598 
  where it was held that subsections 267.1(2) and (8) of the Act require that 
  the assessment of non-pecuniary damages be made without regard to a claimant's 
  inability to recover for pecuniary loss. The trial judge also held that permitting 
  Mr. Padfield to amend the amount sought in his statement of claim from $250,000 
  to $500,000 would prejudice LMT and Mr. Martin. He stated that the charge to 
  the jury had not included an instruction on the cap because it had not occurred 
  to anyone that such an instruction might be necessary in the circumstances of 
  this case, noting that &quot;the jury surprised us all with its assessment of 
  $500,000&quot;. Had Mr. Padfield sought $500,000 originally, the trial judge 
  would have had to instruct the jury on the cap, and the jury's deliberations 
  would have proceeded on a different basis. The trial judge concluded, however, 
  that a more modest amendment to conform to the cap ceiling of $274,000 would 
  not result in any prejudice. After subtracting the statutory deduction, the 
  trial judge entered judgment for Mr. Padfield in the amount of $263,079.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellants appealed, arguing that the resulting award is extravagantly 
  high in the circumstances of this case. They ask that a new trial be ordered 
  or that this court substitute its own assessment of the damages under s. 119 
  of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43. Mr. Padfield cross-appealed, 
  reiterating his argument that the trial judge should not have interfered with 
  the jury's assessment because the cap should not apply in these circumstances. 
  At the hearing of this appeal, counsel for Mr. Padfield submitted further that 
  if the cap does apply, the judgment for the cap amount should stand. In the 
  event that this court deems that amount too high, counsel for Mr. Padfield submitted 
  that this court should substitute its own assessment of damages rather than 
  ordering a new trial.</p>
<p>
  Issues</p>
<p>
  [11] In my view, these are the issues to be considered in this appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) As a matter of principle, was the trial judge correct in 
  adjusting the jury's assessment of damages to an amount that conformed with 
  the cap?</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Are there special or exceptional circumstances in this case, 
  as the respondent contends, that justify an award of general damages exceeding 
  the cap amount of $274,000?</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Did the trial judge err in amending the statement of claim 
  to increase the amount claimed from $250,000 to the cap amount of $274,000?</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Is the award of general damages of $274,000 excessive?</p>
<p class="indent">(5) Should a new trial be ordered, or should the court substitute 
  its own assessment of damages?</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  1. As a matter of principle, was the trial judge correct in adjusting the jury's 
  assessment of damages to an amount that conformed with the cap?</p>
<p>
  [12] As a general rule, where a jury's award for general damages exceeds the 
  upper limit set out in the Andrews trilogy, the trial judge is required to enter 
  judgment for an amount that conforms with that cap. In ter Neuzen v. Korn, [1995] 
  3 S.C.R. 674, Sopinka J. held as follows at para. 114: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Whether the jury is or is not advised of the upper limit, if the award exceeds 
  the limit, the trial judge should reduce the award to conform with the &quot;cap&quot; 
  set out in the trilogy and adjusted for inflation. While a trial judge does 
  not sit in appeal of a jury award, the trilogy has imposed as a rule of law 
  a legal limit to non-pecuniary damages in these cases. It would be wrong for 
  the trial judge to enter judgment for an amount that as a matter of law is excessive. 
  While it is true that the matter can be corrected on appeal, an appeal may be 
  unnecessary if the correct amount is fixed at trial [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [13] In the following paragraph, para. 115, Sopinka J. added: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the present case, counsel for the respondent submitted that this was not 
  a case which would approach the upper limit. However, it was submitted that 
  the jury should be instructed on the limit if the appellant's counsel or the 
  trial judge felt otherwise. Counsel for the appellant did not request that the 
  trial judge charge the jury on the upper limit. In these circumstances, I agree 
  with the Court of Appeal that it was reasonable for the trial judge not to give 
  an instruction on the upper limit. However, since the damages awarded for non-pecuniary 
  losses far exceeded the upper limit, the trial judge ought to have reassessed 
  the award in accordance with the Andrews trilogy. [emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [14] It follows that the trial judge did not err in principle by entering judgment 
  for an amount that conformed with the cap rather than the amount assessed by 
  the jury. </p>
<p>
  [15] Whether the trial judge had any alternatives was not addressed by counsel 
  before the trial judge or this court. The availability of alternatives in circumstances 
  similar to this case was considered recently by the British Columbia Court of 
  Appeal in Hoskin v. Han, 2003 BCCA 220 at paras. 1-11 and 97. However, the result 
  on appeal turned on a different issue.</p>
<p>
  [16] As the court stated in Hoskin, in my view, an alternative available to 
  the trial judge in a case where the jury's assessment exceeds the cap amount, 
  is to provide the jury with the proper instructions about the cap and direct 
  it to reconsider its assessment of general damages. This practice was approved 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada in Herd v. Terkuc [1960] S.C.R. 202, which was 
  applied by this court in Allen v. Brazeau (1967), 65 D.L.R. (2d) 37 (Ont. C.A.). 
  </p>
<p>
  [17] Another alternative where the jury's assessment of general damages exceeds 
  the cap amount is for the trial judge, and not the jury, to reassess damages 
  to ensure that they are consistent with the legal principles applicable to general 
  damages in the circumstances of the case. This raises the question of what Sopinka 
  J. meant, particularly in para. 15 of ter Neuzen, where he said that &quot;the 
  trial judge ought to have reassessed the award in accordance with the Andrews 
  trilogy&quot;. On one interpretation of the view of Sopinka J., the only option 
  open to the trial judge is to reduce the general damages to conform with the 
  cap. Another interpretation, to be considered in a case in which it is contended, 
  as in this case, that the cap is excessive, is for the trial judge to assess 
  damages at an amount below the cap. Support for the second interpretation may 
  be found in the concurring reasons of L'Heruex-Dub&eacute; J. where she said 
  at para. 126: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If an award is excessive, I share my colleague's opinion that the judge should 
  reduce it to an amount that he or she believes is appropriate on the facts of 
  the case in order to avoid an otherwise unnecessary appeal.</p>
<p>
  [18] In my view, both alternatives have many advantages. The major advantage 
  in circumstances such as we have in this case is that having the jury reconsider 
  its award, or permitting the trial judge to make the assessment of general damages, 
  is to avoid an appeal, subject of course to error on the part of the jury or 
  the trial judge. While I am satisfied that authority exists for the jury to 
  reconsider its award, I am uncertain that Sopinka J. intended that the trial 
  judge may do more than to reduce the jury's award to the cap amount. The resolution 
  of this question must await a case in which the issue is properly before this 
  court.</p>
<p>
  2. Are there special or exceptional circumstances in this case, as the respondent 
  contends, that justify an award of general damages exceeding the cap amount 
  of $274,000?</p>
<p>
  [19] In his cross-appeal, however, Mr. Padfield argues that the trial judge 
  was wrong to reduce the award to conform with the cap, notwithstanding the directive 
  in ter Neuzen, because the circumstances of this case render the cap inapplicable. 
  Mr. Padfield addresses what he submits are the two elements of the rationale 
  behind the cap, and argues that neither apply in this case.</p>
<p>
  [20] First, he argues that part of the policy as stated in Andrews at p. 262 
  for imposing a cap on non-pecuniary damages is that the plaintiff is to receive 
  full compensation for his or her pecuniary loss, covering where relevant, past 
  and future loss of income and past and future care expenses. See, also, Lindal 
  v. Lindal, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 629 at 639. Mr. Padfield points out that because 
  of his special circumstances, he does not qualify for any compensation for pecuniary 
  loss, past or future, arising from the accident. He submits, therefore, that 
  the reason for applying a cap to non-pecuniary damages does not exist in his 
  case.</p>
<p>
  [21] His special circumstances are as follows. This is a motor vehicle injury 
  case in which pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages are governed by legislation. 
  Because the motor vehicle accident giving rise to Mr. Padfield's claim occurred 
  between January 1, 1994 and October 31, 1996, this action is governed by s. 
  267.1 of the Insurance Act. Where a person sustains injuries or death as a result 
  of the operation of a motor vehicle, subsections 267.1(1) and (2) operate to 
  eliminate tort liability for damages for pecuniary loss, while preserving liability 
  for damages for non-pecuniary loss in the case of death or serious disfigurement 
  or impairment. Pecuniary loss is intended to be compensated instead under the 
  Act's Statutory Accident Benefits Scheme (&quot;SABS&quot;), set out in the 
  Statutory Accidents Benefits Schedule - Accidents after December 31, 1993 and 
  before November 1, 1996, O. Reg. 776/93. Mr. Padfield notes that because he 
  was a student at the time of the accident, he was eligible only for education 
  disability benefits under the statutory accident benefits scheme. Since he was 
  able to return to school and essentially resume his normal activities after 
  the accident, he failed to qualify for SABS (which, in turn, means that under 
  the scheme he was ineligible for loss of earning capacity benefits). He argues, 
  therefore, that he cannot receive compensation for any financial loss arising 
  from his inability to secure a university scholarship, to pursue a professional 
  volleyball career, and ultimately, to reap any of the other financial benefits 
  that could flow from such a career. Therefore, he argues, he has suffered significant 
  pecuniary loss as a result of his injuries for which there is no compensation 
  available either through tort damages or through SABS.</p>
<p>
  [22] The same argument was made before the trial judge on the motion for judgment 
  following the jury's verdict. The trial judge rejected the argument, concluding 
  that the question of whether the cap applies to cases falling under s. 267.1 
  had already been disposed of in Payne, supra. In that case, in which there was 
  a motion to determine a question of law, Morden J.A. held that the term &quot;non-pecuniary 
  loss&quot; means the same in s. 267.1(2) as it does at common law, and, consequently, 
  that it was subject to the common law cap. He noted further at p. 605 that s. 
  267.1(8), paras. 1 and 2, which require that damages for non-pecuniary loss 
  be determined generally without regard to the provisions of s. 267.1, support 
  the conclusion that a plaintiff's inability to recover damages for pecuniary 
  loss under s. 267.1 is irrelevant to an assessment of non-pecuniary damages: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The better view of s. 267.1(8) is that it is directed to the simple common law 
  rule respecting the assessment of damages for non-pecuniary loss, which rule 
  includes the limit imposed by the trilogy. Specifically, s. 267.1(8), para. 
  2(ii) directs that the determination of non-pecuniary damages is to be made 
  without regard to the fact that the defendant is protected from liability for 
  damages for pecuniary loss. This goes to the heart of the appellants' argument, 
  as the statute is clear that a court cannot take into account that the plaintiff 
  is not recovering damages for pecuniary loss.</p>
<p>
  [23] In my view, Payne provides a conclusive answer to the respondent's submission 
  that because he was not entitled to recover pecuniary damages by the operation 
  of s. 267.1, his inability to receive full compensation for what he refers to 
  as his pecuniary loss should be taken into account in his assessing his non-pecuniary 
  damages. </p>
<p>
  [24] Mr. Padfield, however, places emphasis on the assumption of Morden J.A. 
  at p. 604 that statutory accident benefits, while they generally do not amount 
  to full compensation, are generous, and because they are paid on a no fault 
  basis can sometimes exceed common law pecuniary damages for tort liability. 
  If I understand his argument, he submits that the reasoning in Payne is based 
  at least partly on that conclusion, and, therefore, does not apply to this case, 
  because here, Mr. Padfield will receive virtually no compensation for pecuniary 
  loss. The cap should, therefore, not have been imposed in this case, and the 
  jury's assessment should have been allowed to stand.</p>
<p>
  [25] I do not agree. In essence, the respondent's position is that because injured 
  parties are denied pecuniary damages under s. 267.1 of the Act, which damages 
  would compensate them in full, that there should no longer be a limit on non-pecuniary 
  damages permitted under the provision. This argument was made and rejected in 
  Payne in the passage from the reasons of Morden J.A. that I have quoted above. 
  He stated further at p. 604 that the term &quot;damages for non-pecuniary loss&quot; 
  in s. 267.1(2) has the same meaning that it has at common law under the trilogy.</p>
<p>
  [26] In any event, it seems to me that even if the reasoning in Payne is not 
  applicable, there are nevertheless two reasons why Mr. Padfield's argument remains 
  untenable. First, he is in essence proposing that as a remedy for his inability 
  to pursue compensation for loss of earning capacity either through tort damages 
  for pecuniary loss or through the SABS, it should as a matter of law be open 
  to him to recover for such loss through this jury's award of damages for non-pecuniary 
  loss. This court decided in Payne, however, on a second question of law, that 
  loss of earning capacity is not an element of non-pecuniary loss for the purposes 
  of s. 267.1.</p>
<p>
  [27] More importantly, as the trial judge noted in his endorsement, the trial 
  in this case proceeded on the basis that the jury was not to consider loss of 
  earning capacity in its assessment of damages. Indeed, the trial judge instructed 
  the jury that general damages, which they were required to assess, &quot;are 
  intended to compensate the plaintiff for his non-financial loss&quot;. It was 
  not part of the jury's mandate to take into account Mr. Padfield's inability 
  to recover for such loss through other avenues. In my view, it would make little 
  sense to evaluate their assessment on that basis post facto.</p>
<p>
  [28] Mr. Padfield submits that another element of the rationale behind the cap 
  is the desirability of avoiding the social burden of large awards and the need 
  for uniformity and predictability as between injured plaintiffs. He argues that 
  these values are not offended by failing to apply the cap in the special circumstances 
  of this case, because the class of potential plaintiffs with similar circumstances 
  would be very small. He submits that there would be very few people (1) whose 
  cases fell under s. 267.1, and (2) who would be eligible only for education 
  disability benefits, but (3) who could return to school, as he did, and complete 
  their education, thus losing eligibility for loss of earning capacity benefits. 
  He is essentially asking this court to carve out an exception to the application 
  of the cap for members of that limited class.</p>
<p>
  [29] It is in theory open to this court to create an exception to the cap and 
  to decide that it does not apply in certain circumstances on policy grounds. 
  For example, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded in Hill v. Church of Scientology 
  of Toronto, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, that the cap does not apply in defamation 
  cases, because the function of general damages is different in such cases than 
  in personal injury cases. In British Columbia, the Court of Appeal has concluded 
  that the policy reasons for the cap are not present, and therefore the cap does 
  not apply, where the cause of action is an intentional tort involving criminal 
  behaviour, such as sexual assault: S.Y. v. F.G.C. (1996), 26 B.C.L.R. (3d) 155 
  (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [30] The reasons why this part of Mr. Padfield's argument should fail are the 
  same as those that apply to the first part of his argument. To create an exception 
  for people in Mr. Padfield's circumstances would allow an award for non-pecuniary 
  loss under s. 267.1 effectively to compensate members of that class for their 
  loss of future earning capacity. As noted above, this court in Payne ruled that 
  loss of income and loss of future earning capacity are not elements of non-pecuniary 
  loss under s. 267.1. Furthermore, even if this court were to create such an 
  exception in this case, it could not be of any help to Mr. Padfield, because 
  this trial did not proceed with a view to having the jury quantify his lost 
  earning capacity, and the assessment should not now be reviewed as if it had. 
  Moreover, as the appellants point out, Mr. Padfield presented very little evidence 
  of whether, but for his injuries, he would have received a scholarship to an 
  American university and become a professional volleyball player, and of what 
  he might have earned playing professional volleyball.</p>
<p>
  [31] Mr. Padfield advances the alternative position that the courts maintain 
  a residual discretion at common law to award an amount in excess of the upper 
  limit of damages for non-pecuniary losses in exceptional and rare circumstances, 
  and that this discretion applies under s. 267.1. He submits that if the cap 
  applies in this case, that discretion ought to be exercised here.</p>
<p> [32] As noted above, this court in Payne concluded that the definition of 
  non-pecuniary loss in s. 267.1(2) was the same as the common law definition 
  and thus included the cap. Applying that reasoning, it follows that the definition 
  of non-pecuniary loss in s. 267.1(2) includes any common law rule regarding 
  the possibility of exceeding the cap. The decisions in the Andrews trilogy and 
  in Lindal, left open the possibility of permitting awards larger than the cap 
  in rare and exceptional cases.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> </p>
<p>
  [33] Mr. Padfield appears to argue that, in addition to the physical pain he 
  suffers, the prospect of a career in volleyball was such an important aspect 
  of his life that the loss of that prospect in his case constitutes one of the 
  rare circumstances envisioned by the Supreme Court of Canada for exceeding the 
  cap. As support for this argument, he cites the following passage from Payne 
  at p. 608: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [F]or some injured persons the inability to work, or do certain kinds of work, 
  may be an aspect of the diminution in the amenities of life [citations omitted]. 
  If this is so, then I think it could be properly taken into account under this 
  heading when non-pecuniary damages are assessed.</p>
<p>
  [34] The trial clearly proceeded on the basis that Mr. Padfield was seeking 
  to be compensated for the non-pecuniary aspect of his loss of opportunity to 
  pursue a volleyball career. Indeed, in instructing the jury the trial judge 
  said that the jury could consider Mr. Padfield's loss of ability to pursue a 
  U.S. college scholarship as an element of his loss of amenities of life. It 
  is unlikely, however, that the evidence in this case could support the conclusion 
  that any such loss comes within the category of rare circumstances envisioned 
  by the Supreme Court for exceeding the cap. In Lindal, the Supreme Court addressed 
  the possibility of exceeding the cap as follows at pp. 642-643: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is true that the Court in Andrews spoke of exceeding the limit of $100,000 
  in &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;. The variety of possible fact situations 
  is limitless, and it would be unwise to foreclose the possibility of ever exceeding 
  the guide-line of $100,000. But, if the purpose of the guide-line is properly 
  understood, it will be seen that the circumstances in which it should be exceeded 
  will be rare indeed. We award non-pecuniary damages because the money can be 
  used to make the victim's life more bearable. The limit of $100,000 was not 
  selected because the plaintiff could only make use of $100,000 and no more. 
  Quite the opposite. It was selected because without it, there would be no limit 
  to the various uses to which a plaintiff could put a fund of money. </p>
<p>
  [35] It is difficult to discern from this paragraph what circumstances might 
  be so exceptional as to justify a departure from the cap. It is unlikely though, 
  that Mr. Padfield's loss of opportunity to pursue his volleyball career would 
  be such a circumstance. The disappointment and loss of enjoyment suffered by 
  Mr. Padfield was not presented at trial on the basis that it was exceptionally 
  devastating. It is difficult to accept, as important as volleyball was to Mr. 
  Padfield, that an award of the cap amount of $274,000, or some lesser or greater 
  amount, could not, under the functional approach established in Andrews, provide 
  &quot;reasonable solace for his misfortune.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [36] Therefore, I do not accept the respondent's submission that there are special 
  or exceptional circumstances in this case that would have justified the trial 
  judge declining to interfere with the jury's $500,000 assessment of non-pecuniary 
  damages and refusing to amend the statement of claim to conform with the assessment.</p>
<p>
  3. Did the trial judge err in amending the statement of claim to increase the 
  amount claimed from $250,000 to the cap amount of $274,000?</p>
<p>
  [37] At the trial in Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto (1992), 7 O.R. 
  (3d) 489 (Gen. Div.), aff'd on other grounds 18 O.R. (3d) 385 (C.A.), aff'd 
  on other grounds [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, where aggravated and punitive damages 
  were at issue, Carruthers J. outlined at p. 496 the test under rule 26.01 for 
  amending a statement of claim at the end of trial: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Subsequent cases which have dealt with the wording of the rule, to my mind, 
  suggest that &quot;prejudice&quot; within the context of that wording means 
  that the amendment, if allowed, would alter the case to be met and that costs 
  or an adjournment would not permit the defendant the opportunity or ability 
  to fairly meet it. As Osler J. has said, the onus is upon the defendant, or 
  the defendants as the case may be, to demonstrate such prejudice on a balance 
  of probabilities. In this respect, I do not think the fact of the jury's assessment 
  being higher than the amounts claimed in the statement of claim, of itself, 
  satisfies this onus.</p>
<p>
  [38] In this case, the appellants argue that the trial judge should not have 
  amended the amount sought in the statement of claim after the delivery of the 
  jury's verdict because it resulted in prejudice to them. They argue that the 
  amendment altered the case to be met, and that they would have prepared for 
  trial differently had they had notice ahead of time that a higher amount would 
  be sought. </p>
<p>
  [39] In Whiten v. Pilot Insurance (1996), 27 O.R. (3d) 479 (Gen. Div.), var'd 
  on other grounds (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.), aff'd on other grounds 2002 
  SCC 18, (2002) 209 D.L.R. (4th) 257, the trial judge permitted an amendment 
  to a claim for punitive damages from $125,000 to $1,000,000 at the end of the 
  trial, where the defendant could not show it would have defended differently 
  had the claim for $1,000,000 been included in the statement of claim. Similarly, 
  in Papadakis v. Camilleri (1989), 33 C.P.C. (2d) 291 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), a claim 
  for general damages was amended from $40,000 to $100,000, where the arguments 
  made by defence as to what would have been done differently did not, in the 
  trial judge's view, meet the onus of establishing prejudice. See also Aslanovic 
  v. Paterson (1993), 23 C.P.C. (3d) 190 (Ont. Gen. Div.).</p>
<p>
  [40] The appellants' description in their factum of what they would have done 
  differently seems to take into account a hypothetical amendment to $500,000; 
  in fact, the trial judge rejected such an amendment and instead permitted an 
  amendment up to the cap amount. It is difficult to imagine how the Appellants 
  would have defended differently against a claim for $274,000 as compared to 
  $250,000, and therefore I am satisfied that they were not prejudiced as a result 
  of the amendment permitted by the trial judge. Accordingly, the trial judge 
  did not err in amending the statement of claim.</p>
<p>
  4. Is the award of general damages of $274,000 excessive?</p>
<p>
  [41] It now remains to determine whether the circumstances of this case warrant 
  an award of non-pecuniary damages at the upper limit of the cap. The appellants 
  contend that the award of $274,000 is excessive and that this is a proper case 
  in which the award should be set aside and a new trial ordered, or in which 
  this court should substitute its assessment of the respondent's non-pecuniary 
  damages.</p>
<p>
  [42] The leading case on the standard of appellate review of an assessment of 
  damages generally is Nance v. B.C. Electric Railway, [1951] A.C. 601, [1951] 
  3 D.L.R. 705 (P.C.). In that case, the Privy Council held as follows at 713-14 
  D.L.R.: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Whether the assessment of damages be by a Judge or a jury, the Appellate Court 
  is not justified in substituting a figure of its own for that awarded below 
  simply because it would have awarded a different figure if it had tried the 
  case at first instance. Even if the tribunal of first instance was a Judge sitting 
  alone, then, before the Appellate Court can properly intervene, it must be satisfied 
  either that the Judge, in assessing the damages, applied a wrong principle of 
  law (as by taking into account some irrelevant factor or leaving out of account 
  some relevant one); or, short of this, that the amount awarded is either so 
  inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous 
  estimate of the damage (Flint v. Lovell, [1935] 1 K.B. 354, approved by the 
  House of Lords in Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd., [1942] 
  A.C. 601). The last-named case further shows that when on a proper direction 
  the quantum is ascertained by a jury, the disparity between the figure at which 
  they have arrived and any figure at which they could properly have arrived must, 
  to justify correction by a Court of Appeal, be even wider than when the figure 
  has been assessed by a Judge sitting alone. The figure must be wholly &quot;out 
  of proportion&quot; (per Lord Wright, Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries, 
  Ltd. at p. 616).</p>
<p>
  [43] In Koukounakis v. Stainrod (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 299 at 305-306 (C.A.), 
  Doherty J.A. confirmed the appropriate degree of deference in the case of jury 
  assessments of non-pecuniary damages, and explained how the standard of review 
  is to be applied: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Appellate courts do not decide whether a jury made the &quot;correct&quot; award 
  for general non-pecuniary damages, but only whether the award is &quot;beyond 
  the scope of anything that could be accepted as reasonable&quot;.... Review 
  for reasonableness, as opposed to correctness, demands not only deference to 
  the amount awarded, but also deference to the findings of fact underlying the 
  award.... Insofar as the verdict does not reveal findings of fact relevant to 
  the assessment of general non-pecuniary damages, this court should assume that 
  the jury made all findings of fact reasonably available to it and capable of 
  supporting its assessment. Where, as here, the defendant claims that the award 
  is too high, that claim must be judged by reference to the relevant factual 
  findings, if any, implicit in the jury's verdict, combined with any other findings 
  of fact reasonably available to the jury and capable of supporting the plaintiff's 
  claim for general non-pecuniary damages. </p>
<p>
  [44] As a preliminary matter, although the final award in this case involved 
  the trial judge's intervention by reducing the jury's assessment to the cap 
  amount, in my view that amount should be considered as the jury's assessment 
  for the purposes of review. The judge was not substituting his own assessment, 
  but simply correcting the jury's assessment to conform with a legal rule, as 
  required by ter Neuzen. </p>
<p>
  [45] As the trial judge was correct in principle in reducing the jury's assessment 
  to conform with the cap amount, the task is to apply the principles outlined 
  in Koukounakis to that amount of $274,000. Here, the jury's verdict does not 
  reveal relevant findings of fact, so in the first instance, the court &quot;should 
  assume that the jury made all findings of fact reasonably available to it and 
  capable of supporting its assessment&quot;. In my view, it was reasonable in 
  this case for the jury to find as a fact that Mr. Padfield suffered a great 
  deal of physical pain as a result of the accident. It was also reasonable for 
  them to find that the accident was causally related to Mr. Padfield's ongoing 
  pain and to his diminished capacity to play volleyball, notwithstanding the 
  evidence of his pre-existing condition. In Koukounakis, where the plaintiff 
  also had pre-existing medical problems that might or might not have contributed 
  to her post-accident &quot;lot in life&quot;, Doherty J.A. held that it was 
  for the jury to choose between competing views, and that the court should assume 
  that the jury made the finding most favourable to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>
  [46] Similarly, although it may be doubtful whether, but for the accident, Mr. 
  Padfield would have had the opportunity to play on the national volleyball team, 
  receive a scholarship to an American school and/or play volleyball in a professional 
  capacity, there was some evidence, if accepted by the jury, that could have 
  supported that conclusion, and this court should, therefore, again assume that 
  the jury made the finding most favourable to Mr. Padfield. It was reasonable, 
  further, for the jury to find that playing volleyball at an elite level was 
  for Mr. Padfield an important dream.</p>
<p>
  [47] Having made these assumptions of the jury's findings of fact, the next 
  step is to decide whether their assessment (in this case, as corrected by the 
  trial judge), was, with reference to those findings, &quot;beyond the scope 
  of anything that was reasonable&quot;. As noted in Koukounakis at pp. 308-309, 
  a comparison of an award with amounts assessed in other cases is useful in measuring 
  its fairness; indeed, part of the impetus for imposing a cap in Andrews was 
  to promote consistency and uniformity in non-pecuniary damage awards. As acknowledged 
  by the court in Koukounakis, though, it must be kept in mind that comparative 
  analysis with damage awards in other cases offers only limited assistance, because 
  the emphasis in assessing non-pecuniary damages in Canada is on the effect of 
  the injury on the particular plaintiff. </p>
<p>
  [48] The appellants' factum refers to a number of cases involving either similar 
  injuries or plaintiffs who were, like Mr. Padfield, competitive athletes before 
  their injuries. These cases, which might or might not be representative, resulted 
  in general damage awards well below $274,000, even adjusting for inflation. 
  The highest award, a 1991 case, was $80,000. In addition, the parties, in their 
  exchange of several offers to settle, did not contemplate damages in the range 
  of $274,000. At the high end, they ranged from the appellants' offer of $97,000 
  to the respondent's offer of $125,000. Although it would not be proper for a 
  trial judge or a jury to consider offers to settle, it is not inappropriate 
  for an appellate court to do so in reviewing an award of damages made at trial. 
  However, I would observe that in his factum the respondent contends that if 
  his loss of opportunity to play professional volleyball is taken into account 
  as an element of the loss of amenities of life, this could be justification 
  for assessing general damages at the higher end of the range of damages in similar 
  cases, while conceding that this factor would not have the effect of exceeding 
  the cap.</p>
<p>
  [49] In my view, even with the assumption of facts most favourable to the plaintiff, 
  including the importance to him of his dream of playing volleyball at an elite 
  level, and keeping in mind the limitations of a comparative analysis, $274,000 
  is an inordinately high amount to award to Mr. Padfield as &quot;reasonable 
  solace for his misfortune.&quot; I conclude, therefore, that the jury's assessment, 
  as adjusted by the trial judge, cannot stand.</p>
<p>
  5. Should a new trial be ordered, or should the court substitute its own assessment 
  of damages?</p>
<p>
  [50] As I have concluded that an award of general damages of $274,000 is excessive 
  and cannot stand, the issue becomes whether a new trial for the assessment of 
  damages should be ordered or whether we should substitute our own assessment 
  of damages as permitted by s. 119 of the Courts of Justice Act. Although the 
  appellants have asked for a new trial, they do not take exception to this court 
  substituting its own assessment. The respondent, on the other hand, urges that 
  this court assess his damages to avoid the delay and expense of a new trial.</p>
<p> [51] Prior to 1989, where an appeal court in Ontario set aside a jury's assessment 
  of damages, the common law did not permit the court to substitute its own assessment 
  without the consent of counsel; in such circumstances, the court had no choice 
  but to order a new trial: see Sikora v. Asbestonos Corporation Limited, [1975] 
  1 S.C.R. 115; lker v. CFTO Ltd. (1987), 59 O.R. (2d) 104 (C.A.).<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  Since the introduction of what is now s. 119 of the Courts of Justice Act,<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> 
  however, both options have been open to appeal courts in personal injury cases 
  as a matter of statute. Section 119 gives an appeal court the power to substitute 
  its own assessment of damages in a personal injury case, where the court &quot;considers 
  it just&quot; to do so.</p>
<p>
  [52] On at least four occasions since the introduction of s. 119 this court 
  has substituted its own assessment of damages in personal injury cases pursuant 
  to that provision. In To v. Toronto Board of Education (2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 
  641 (C.A.), and Etmanski v. Magnum Glass, [1998] O.J. No. 4057 (C.A.) (an endorsement), 
  the court made a substitution on the basis that on the evidence the amount assessed 
  by the jury at trial was inordinately high. In MacKinnon v. Western Fair Assn., 
  [1993] O.J. No. 472 (C.A.) (an endorsement), the court was asked to give its 
  own assessment of damages where the amount assessed by the jury was greater 
  than the amount claimed and the trial judge who had no alternative, entered 
  judgment for the amount claimed. This court reduced the damages. In Hutton v. 
  Way (1997), 105 O.A.C. 361 (C.A.), although this court found the damages to 
  be excessive, the court concluded that since certain evidence was improperly 
  admitted the relief would ordinarily be a new trial, but substituted its own 
  assessment for damages because that was the remedy sought by the respondent. 
  </p>
<p>[53] At the same time, an appeal court has the general power to order a new 
  trial in a case before it, pursuant to s. 134(1)(a) of the Courts of Justice 
  Act. The test for determining whether to order a new trial is found in s. 134(6), 
  which requires that there be &quot;some substantial wrong or miscarriage of 
  justice&quot;. On two occasions since the introduction of s. 119, an appeal 
  court has ordered a new trial in a personal injury case solely for the purpose 
  of reassessing damages, despite the availability of the option to substitute 
  under s. 119. In Alderson v. Callaghan (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 136 (C.A.), this 
  court declined to substitute its own assessment pursuant to s. 119 and ordered 
  a new trial where the trial judge's instruction to the jury on the issue of 
  contributory causation was held to have been incorrect. In Smilovsky v. Cartwright 
  (2001), 6 C.P.C. (5th) 381 (Ont. Div. Ct.), the Divisional Court ordered a new 
  trial on damages on the basis that the jury's answer to one of the factual questions 
  posed to it was legally perverse, constituting a substantial wrong or miscarriage 
  of justice. The Court in that case, however, did not address the alternate possibility 
  of substituting its own assessment pursuant to s. 119.</p>
<p>
  [54] It is difficult to distill governing principles from such a small sample 
  of cases. One conclusion that might be drawn is that appeal courts have ordered 
  (or in the case of Hutton, would ordinarily have ordered) a new trial on the 
  issue of damages where they have identified a legal error. A substitution, on 
  the other hand, has been made where no legal error has been identified, but 
  the amount awarded is found to be inordinately high or low on the evidence. 
  The exception would be Smilovsky, where a new trial was ordered even though 
  no error was found in the conduct of the trial. As mentioned above, however, 
  the court in Smilovsky did not address the alternate of substituting its own 
  assessment.</p>
<p> [55] The law in England provides some guidance. In that jurisdiction, until 
  recently the common law also required that a new trial be ordered where the 
  parties did not consent to an appellate court assessment of damages: see H. 
  McGregor, McGregor on Damages, 16th ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1997) 
  at para. 2091. Now, by statute, in any case where the Court of Appeal has the 
  power to order a new trial on the ground that the jury's award was excessive 
  or inadequate, the Court may substitute its own assessment of damages.<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a> 
  According to McGregor at para. 2093, however, the power to substitute is still 
  not available in cases where the Court concludes that there has been an error 
  of law, or misconduct by the jury: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he power now given to the Court of Appeal to substitute its own award instead 
  of granting a new trial is confined to cases where the ground for interference 
  is that the jury's award is excessive or inadequate. Where the ground for interference 
  is that there has been misdirection or other error on the part of the trial 
  judge or that there has been misconduct as to damages by the jury, a situation 
  little seen today, the position is unchanged, with no power in the appellate 
  court to substitute its own figure. Even if the result of, say, a misdirection 
  of the trial judge is an award which is too high or too low, the ground for 
  interference is the trial judge's misdirection and not the jury's miscalculation; 
  the excessiveness or inadequacy of the award is only consequential upon the 
  misdirection.</p>
<p> [56] In my view, there is much to be said for this analysis. Where the fairness 
  of the trial is not in issue, and the jury appears simply to have arrived at 
  an inappropriate assessment on the evidence, the interest in avoiding the delay 
  and expense of a new trial would seem to weigh in favour of the appeal court 
  substituting its own assessment.<a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="r5"></a> Conversely, a new trial 
  is likely more appropriate where errors in the conduct of the trial were such 
  that, had those errors not occurred, there might have been a different outcome. 
  In such cases, an appeal court's assessment of what that outcome would have 
  been would likely require much greater speculation. It might be said, in the 
  language of s. 119, that while it would be &quot;just&quot; to substitute where 
  the jury appears simply to have made an inappropriate assessment, often it will 
  not be &quot;just&quot; to do so where there was a significant error at trial. 
  Rather, in the language of s. 134(6), such an error will often constitute a 
  &quot;substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice&quot;, warranting a new trial. 
  Of course, as evidenced by Hutton, an appeal court ultimately maintains the 
  wide discretion under ss. 119 and 134 to grant whatever relief is sought by 
  the successful party.</p>
<p>
  [57] Although up to this point it has not entered into my consideration of this 
  appeal, the appellants submit that the trial judge erred in instructing the 
  jury on the nature of general damages. They submit that the trial judge erred 
  in the following elaboration of the respondent's loss of his ability to enjoy 
  the normal amenities of life: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The ability to enjoy the normal amenities of life. You will consider to what 
  extent the plaintiff is unable and will be unable to enjoy the normal social 
  routine of life which would be enjoyed by a person of his age and the loss of 
  the ability to pursue a U.S. scholarship [emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [58] The appellants contend the italicized language of this instruction may 
  account for the jury's assessment of $500,000 general damages as the jury may 
  have understood from it that as an element of general damages they could include 
  their view of the income loss by the respondent because he was not able to pursue 
  a professional volleyball career. I do not agree.</p>
<p>
  [59] In my view, read as a whole the trial judge's instructions to the jury 
  on the assessment of general non-pecuniary damages are impeccable. Indeed, no 
  objection to this instruction was taken by trial counsel. It is clear that the 
  impugned passage was not an invitation to the jury to consider, as an element 
  of the respondent's general damages, the respondent's loss of any financial 
  benefits that may have come his way had he received a scholarship to a U.S. 
  college. As I have indicated, this instruction was merely an elaboration of 
  the trial judge's earlier explanation of the meaning of a person's loss of ability 
  to enjoy the normal amenities of life as a result of injuries caused by a defendant's 
  negligence. As such, it was in conformity with what this court said in Payne 
  at p. 608, which I have quoted in para. 33. Moreover, the trial judge made it 
  quite clear to the jury that general non-pecuniary damages were not intended 
  to compensate the respondent for his financial loss.</p>
<p>
  [60] As there was no error in the trial judge's instruction to the jury on general 
  non-pecuniary damages, it is open to this court to substitute its own assessment 
  of damages. There is no doubt that this is the desirable course to follow to 
  avoid the delay and expense of a new trial, as well as to achieve the goal of 
  judicial economy.</p>
<p>
  [61] In his opening argument, counsel for the appellants suggested a range of 
  $100,000 to $115,000 if we were inclined to assess the respondent's general 
  damages. In reply, he conceded that this range was too low, and proposed a range 
  of $125,000 to $150,000. As I have indicated, an appellate court in reviewing 
  damages is entitled to take into account all findings of fact favourable to 
  the plaintiff reasonably available to the jury and capable of supporting the 
  plaintiff's claim for general damages. </p>
<p>
  [62] Mindful that caution is required when using a comparative analysis of damage 
  awards in other cases, I would observe that the cap amount is usually reserved 
  for cases of catastrophic injuries which severely disable the injured plaintiff. 
  The respondent's circumstances are far removed from those of one who has been 
  severely disabled. He was prepared to accept $125,000 to settle his claim, which 
  is within the range proposed by the appellants. Given that an amount proposed 
  in a settlement offer usually takes into account a number of contingencies, 
  I would assess the respondent's general damages in the amount of $150,000, plus 
  pre-judgment interest and GST, which in my view is an appropriate award for 
  general damages. This award is subject to the statutory deduction.</p>
<p>
  Result</p>
<p>
  [63] For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal with costs, set aside 
  the trial judge's award of damages and vary the judgment to give effect to these 
  reasons. I would dismiss the respondent's cross-appeal with costs. The parties 
  are to address the costs of the appeal by way of written submissions. The appellants 
  are to provide their submissions and their bill of costs to the Senior Legal 
  Officer within 15 days from the release of these reasons. The respondent is 
  to file his submissions within seven days after receipt of the appellants' submissions. 
  The appellants may reply within seven days thereafter.</p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> The passage quoted above from ter Neuzen 
  might be interpreted as closing off this possibility by describing the cap as 
  a &#147;rule of law&#148; (see S.M. Waddams, The Law of Damages, looseleaf (Aurora, 
  ON: Canada Law Book, 2002) at para. 3.570), but because that question was not 
  argued I will address this issue as if ter Neuzen does not have that effect.</p>

  been the case; in Nance, supra, for example, the Privy Council reduced a jury&#146;s

  67, s. 4.</p>
<p><a name="4"></a><a href="#r4">[4]</a> Section 8 of the Courts and Legal Services 
  Act 1990 reads, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="indent">Powers of Court of Appeal to award damages. </p>
<p class="indent"> 8.&#151;(1) In this section &quot;case&quot; means any case 
  where the Court of Appeal has power to order a new trial on the ground that 
  damages awarded by a jury are excessive or inadequate.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Rules of court may provide for the Court of Appeal, in such 
  classes of case as may be specified in the rules, to have power, in place of 
  ordering a new trial, to substitute for the sum awarded by the jury such sum 
  as appears to the court to be proper.</p>
<p class="indent">R.S.C., Ord. 59, r. 11(4) is the rule that provides for the 
  Court of Appeal to have the power to substitute:</p>
<p class="indent">In any case where the Court of Appeal has power to order a new 
  trial on the ground that the damages awarded by a jury are excessive or inadequate, 
  the Court may, instead of ordering a new trial, substitute for the sum awarded 
  by the jury such sum as appears to the Court to be proper; but except as aforesaid 
  the Court of Appeal shall not have power to reduce or increase the damages awarded 
  by a jury.</p>
<p><a name="5"></a><a href="#r5">[5]</a> Although the legislative debates surrounding 
  the bill that introduced what is now s. 119 shed no light on the matter, it 
  is likely that the provision was designed to address this interest by creating 
  an exception to the common law prohibition on substitution in such cases. </p>
