<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Ted Matlow of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated March 18, 2002, reported at [2002] O.J. No. 1018.</p> <P>
  MACPHERSON J.A.:</p> <P>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p> <P>
  [1] Paletta International Corporation (&quot;Paletta&quot;) is an Ontario company 
  with headquarters in Stoney Creek. It is engaged in the business of land development, 
  contracting and property management throughout Ontario.</p> <P>
  [2] Canada Life Assurance Company (&quot;Canada Life&quot;) is also an Ontario 
  company. It engages in a broad range of commercial and financial activities, 
  including the provision of loans by way of mortgages secured on land holdings.</p> <P>
  [3] In 1991, Paletta and Canada Life entered into negotiations about a large 
  commercial loan. Paletta was to be the borrower; Canada Life would be the lender. 
  The mortgage in question was to be a long term mortgage for $6.9 million secured 
  by a charge on a shopping centre in Burlington.</p> <P>
  [4] The proposed transaction had two features which are typical of such arrangements: 
  (1) upon entering into the mortgage commitment, Paletta paid Canada Life a 'commitment 
  fee' of $138,000 to compensate Canada Life for its risk of entering into the 
  commitment; and (2) the parties specified a 'rental achievement figure', a minimum 
  rental income that the shopping centre had to generate to support the loan before 
  the mortgage would be advanced.</p> <P>
  [5] The transaction did not proceed. Canada Life kept the commitment fee. Paletta 
  sued to get it back.</p> <P>
  [6] After a five day trial, Matlow J. ordered Canada Life to return the commitment 
  fee to Paletta. Canada Life appeals from that decision. The appeal relates entirely 
  to the interpretation of the two contracts entered into by the parties, the 
  Commitment Agreement and the Commitment Fee Agreement.</p> <P>
  B. FACTS</p> <P>
  (1) The contracts</p> <P>
  [7] Paletta and Canada Life entered into two agreements on June 7, 1991. By 
  the terms of the Commitment Agreement (the &quot;CA&quot;), Canada Life agreed 
  to loan Paletta $6.9 million secured by a 25 year mortgage on a shopping centre 
  in Burlington. Paragraph 24 of the CA set out what is commonly referred to as 
  a 'rental achievement figure':</p> 
<P class="indent"> 24. The property shall be producing annualized rental income, 
  from tenants in occupancy, with leases in full force and effect, and paying 
  rent, of at least $1,038,878.00 . . . .</p> 
<P>
  [8] The parties also executed a second contract on the same day, the Commitment 
  Fee Agreement (the &quot;CFA&quot;). Paletta paid $138,000 to Canada Life on 
  the execution of this agreement.</p> <P>
  [9] Paletta never met the rental achievement figure. In February 1991, the shopping 
  centre was yielding rent of $997,380. By September 1991, the projected closing 
  date of the mortgage transaction, the rent level had dropped to $921,000.</p> <P>
  [10] From September 1991 to February 1992, the parties engaged in extensive 
  negotiations to restructure the agreement. The negotiations failed. On February 
  18, 1992, Canada Life advised Paletta that it would not fund the loan. </p> <P>
  [11] Canada Life decided to keep the commitment fee. It did so on the basis 
  of paragraph 29 of the CA and paragraph 2 of the CFA which provided in relevant 
  parts:</p> 
<P class="indent"> Commitment Agreement</p>
<P class="indent">29. If the full advance under the mortgage has not been made 
  by September 1, 1991 . . . the Commitment Fee will be retained by the Lender 
  as liquidated damages and as compensation for the commitment . . . .</p>
<P class="indent"> Commitment Fee Agreement</p>
<P class="indent"> 2. If, for any reason, including, without limiting the generality 
  of the foregoing, any failure or inability of the Borrower to satisfy any of 
  the terms and conditions contained in the said First Mortgage Loan Approval,</p>
<P class="indent"> (a) the mortgage has not been registered by the 1st day of 
  September, 1991, or by such later date as CLMS, in its sole and unfettered discretion, 
  may agree to in writing, or</p>
<P class="indent"> (b) the first advance under the mortgage has not been made 
  by the 1st day of September, 1991, or by such later date as CLMS in its sole 
  and unfettered discretion, may agree to in writing . . .</p>
<P class="indent"> then and in any of such events the Commitment Fee will be . 
  . . retained by CLMS . . . as liquidated damages and as compensation for the 
  commitment . . . .</p>
<P>
  [12] Canada Life took the position that these provisions made it clear that 
  it could retain the $138,000 commitment fee. The borrower, Paletta, had failed 
  to satisfy the rental achievement figure in paragraph 24 of the CA and, as a 
  result, Canada Life had not advanced the mortgage funds by the middle of February, 
  the extended closing date for the transaction to be completed.</p> <P>
  [13] Paletta took a different view. It relied on paragraph 15 of the CA, which 
  it had insisted be added to the agreement:</p> 
<P class="indent"> 15. . . .</p>
<P class="indent15">In the event that this commitment is terminated by the Lender 
  for any reason whatsoever, save and except for default by the Borrower as defined 
  in this Commitment, then the Commitment Fee . . . shall be immediately returned 
  to the Borrower in full without deduction. </p>
<P>
  [14] Paletta's position was that it had not defaulted under the CA. It acknowledged 
  that the rental achievement figure of $1,038,878 had never been reached. However, 
  the failure to meet this term of the agreement was the result of market forces, 
  not any failure or defect in its own performance.</p> <P>
  (2) The litigation</p> <P>
  [15] Paletta brought an action for the return of the commitment fee. It advanced 
  four arguments in support of its claim. Matlow J. heard the action during five 
  days in March 2002. He first considered two issues raised by Paletta in an amendment 
  to its Statement of Claim made in the course of the trial, namely, a claim for 
  rectification of the CA and a claim for its rescission based on an alleged misrepresentation 
  by Canada Life concerning the importance of the rental achievement figure of 
  $1,038,878. The trial judge rejected these claims. Neither issue is relevant 
  to this appeal.</p> <P>
  [16] The trial judge then turned to the central issue, the interpretation of 
  the CA and the CFA. He referred to the three relevant provisions in these documents 
  (set out above). He concluded that neither paragraph 29 of the CA nor paragraph 
  2 of the CFA supported Paletta's position: &quot;There is nothing in either 
  of these provisions that would expressly relieve the plaintiff from their consequences 
  if it were not responsible for the failure . . . to make the full advance by 
  the specified deadline or the extended deadline in February, 1992.&quot;</p> <P>
  [17] The trial judge then considered paragraph 15 of the CA. He observed that 
  the word &quot;default&quot; was not defined in the CA. He invoked the definition 
  in The Concise Oxford Dictionary (8th ed.) - &quot;failure to fulfil an obligation, 
  esp. to appear, pay, or act in some way&quot;. He then reasoned:</p> 
<P class="indent"> It is my view that the failure to achieve the rental target 
  figure specified in the commitment agreement cannot be attributed to any default 
  on the part of the plaintiff . . . . [It] was the result of prevailing economic 
  conditions over which the plaintiff had no control and for which, in my view, 
  it should not be held responsible.</p> 
<P>
  [18] The result of this analysis was that Canada Life was entitled to refuse 
  to advance the mortgage funds and to terminate the transaction. However, Canada 
  Life could not retain the commitment fee because &quot;there is no reason why 
  it should not assume the consequences of the risk that it, too, incurred that 
  the rental target figure would not be achieved.&quot;</p> <P>
  [19] The trial judge then considered a final issue. Throughout the period of 
  negotiations, the parties disagreed about whether Paletta was required to deliver 
  to Canada Life notices of assignments of existing leases so that they could 
  be registered on title. The trial judge regarded this as a deal breaker on Canada 
  Life's side. He concluded that &quot;even if the rental target figure had been 
  achieved, the plaintiff (sic) would not have advanced the mortgage funds.&quot; 
  This provided &quot;a second reason why the transaction failed through no fault 
  or &quot;default&quot; on the part of the plaintiff.&quot;</p> <P>
  [20] Canada Life appeals the trial judge's decision.</p> <P>
  C. ISSUES</p> <P>
  [21] There are two issues on this appeal:</p> <P>
  (1) Did the trial judge err in his interpretation of the contracts and, in particular, 
  paragraphs 15 and 29 of the Commitment Agreement and paragraph 2 of the Commitment 
  Fee Agreement?</p> <P>
  (2) Did the trial judge err in his determination that Canada Life would not 
  have advanced the mortgage funds in any event because Paletta would not deliver 
  to Canada Life notices of assignments of leases which could be registered on 
  title?</p> <P>
  D. ANALYSIS</p> <P>
  (1) The 'default' issue</p> <P>
  [22] The rental achievement figure of $1,038,878 was never achieved at any point 
  in the May 1991 to February 1992 time frame. Much of the evidence at trial related 
  to Paletta's assertion that it had been assured by Canada Life that it could 
  ignore this figure because it was being included for internal Canada Life purposes. 
  The trial judge rejected this argument. He specifically rejected Angelo Paletta's 
  evidence on this issue, concluding that &quot;the rental target figure was a 
  critical component of the agreement and it defies belief that Dane [a Canada 
  Life representative] would tell Paletta in effect that it was of no legal consequence.&quot;</p> <P>
  [23] The trial judge then analyzed the failure to meet the rental achievement 
  figure in light of the three provisions in the CA and the CFA that related to 
  the potential retention of the commitment fee by Canada Life. He determined 
  that both paragraph 29 of the CA and paragraph 2 of the CFA supported retention. 
  I agree with this component of his analysis and conclusions.</p> <P>
  [24] The trial judge then considered paragraph 15 of the CA. Since the pivotal 
  word of the provision, &quot;default&quot;, was not defined in the CA, the trial 
  judge properly turned to a dictionary definition. He used the meaning ascribed 
  to &quot;default&quot; in The Concise Oxford Dictionary (8th ed.) - &quot;failure 
  to fulfil an obligation, esp. to appear, pay, or act in some way.&quot;</p> <P>
  [25] The trial judge then applied this definition. He concluded that &quot;the 
  failure&quot; to meet the rental achievement figure was not Paletta's fault; 
  rather, it flowed from the neutral (from the perspective of the contract) factor 
  of deteriorating economic conditions which caused a diminution in the tenant 
  base at the shopping centre.</p> <P>
  [26] With respect, I disagree with this final component in the trial judge's 
  reasoning. In the dictionary definition set out above, the concept of failure 
  is not linked to fault. The rental income at the shopping centre was Paletta's 
  responsibility; the amount of projected rental income would serve as the principal 
  basis for calculating the security Paletta could, and would, advance to obtain 
  the mortgage loan from Canada Life. As expressed by Goldie J.A. in Prudential 
  Insurance Co. of America v. Cedar Hills Properties Ltd. (1994), 100 B.C.L.R. 
  (2d) 312 at 319 (C.A):</p> 
<P class="indent"> The final determination of, amongst other things, the amount 
  of the loan; the term; the interest rate; the amortization period, if not coincidental 
  with the term, together with other variables more specific to the circumstances 
  of the parties is the product of negotiation in which market forces are at work. 
  The lender seeks a trouble free investment. The terms he offers reflects his 
  appraisal of the risk and the availability of investment opportunities. The 
  borrower seeks terms which reflect his appraisal of the security he can offer 
  and his need.</p>
<P class="indent">[Emphasis added.]</p>
<P>
  [27] Paletta agreed to a rental achievement figure of $1,038,878 which was inserted 
  into paragraph 24 of the CA. Paletta knew its shopping centre operation, and 
  its tenants and their rents, and was a large and experienced player in Ontario 
  commerce. By agreeing to a provision which stated that the property &quot;shall 
  be producing&quot; annual rents of $1,038,878, Paletta was accepting responsibility 
  to ensure compliance with that provision as a term of receiving the $6.9 million 
  loan it desired.</p> <P>
  [28] Interestingly, in a different portion of his reasons, the trial judge cogently 
  described the purpose of the rental achievement figure, and did so in terms 
  that clearly indicated that the responsibility rested with Paletta:</p> <P>
  The obvious purpose of including the provision with respect to the rental target 
  figure was to ensure that at the time of the advance of the mortgage proceeds 
  the plaintiff would have the specified flow of rental income with which to fund 
  its obligations pursuant to the mortgage.</p> <P>
  [29] I agree with this passage. The $1,038,878 figure in paragraph 24 of the 
  CA reflected, as Goldie J.A. expressed it in Prudential, Paletta's &quot;appraisal 
  of the security&quot; it could offer.</p> <P>
  [30] In summary, although I agree with much of the trial judge's reasoning on 
  this issue, in my respectful view he erred by injecting an element of fault 
  into the meaning of &quot;failure&quot;. In a commercial transaction between 
  two sophisticated parties, the reasons for Paletta's failure to meet a condition 
  of the agreement which was its responsibility is irrelevant. Default was failure, 
  period. Paletta failed and, therefore, was in default.</p> <P>
  [31] As the trial judge said, the rental achievement figure was &quot;a critical 
  component of the agreement&quot;. Paletta's default concerning it entitled Canada 
  Life to decline to advance the mortgage funds and to retain the commitment fee.</p> <P>
  (2) The notices of assignments of leases issue</p> <P>
  [32] There can be no question that the principal issue at trial was the rental 
  achievement issue. The primacy of that issue is reflected in the space and attention 
  devoted to it in the trial judge's reasons. However, the trial judge did advance 
  a second, and independent, reason for deciding the action in favour of Paletta.</p> <P>
  [33] In the very early stages of the negotiations, the parties disagreed about 
  whether Paletta should provide notices of assignments of leases capable of being 
  registered on title. Paletta was of the view that Canada Life's position on 
  this issue was not supported by the terms of the CA. It is clear that this issue 
  was never resolved in the extended negotiation period from September 1991 to 
  February 1992.</p> <P>
  [34] In brief reasons, the trial judge stated that Canada Life &quot;never resiled 
  from its position that it would not advance the mortgage funds unless the plaintiff 
  complied with its demand.&quot; Accordingly, he concluded that &quot;even if 
  the rental target figure had been achieved, the plaintiff (sic) would not have 
  advanced the mortgage funds.&quot; This constituted &quot;a second reason why 
  the transaction failed through no fault or &quot;default&quot; on the part of 
  the plaintiff.&quot;</p> <P>
  [35] With respect, the trial judge's conclusion on this issue is speculative. 
  The evidence at trial made it clear that the central issue throughout the five 
  month extended negotiation period was the rental achievement figure. The testimony 
  of the two Canada Life witnesses, Brien Dane and Robert Barnes, established 
  that, in February 1992, it was Paletta's inability to meet its responsibility 
  on this matter that triggered Canada Life's final decision to terminate the 
  transaction. Moreover, in his testimony, Richard Applebaum, Paletta's solicitor 
  throughout the transaction, acknowledged that the assignment of lease issue 
  was still a live one which, based on his past experience with similar transactions, 
  he hoped to resolve in Paletta's favour.</p> <P>
  [36] In short, the transaction never got past the rental achievement figure 
  issue. As a result, the parties did not address themselves to the question of 
  whether the transaction would proceed despite the notice of assignment of lease 
  issue. In these circumstances, what might have happened had the rental achievement 
  figure issue been resolved is speculative and irrelevant.</p> <P>
  E. DISPOSITION</p> <P>
  [37] I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the trial judge and 
  dismiss the action. I would order that the appellant receive its costs of the 
  trial, to be assessed, and its costs of the appeal fixed at $15,000 inclusive 
  of disbursements and GST.</p> <P>
