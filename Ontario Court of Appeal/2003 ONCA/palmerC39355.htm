<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are satisfied on the evidence before us that, in coming to his determination 
  as to quantum of spousal support, the trial judge relied on erroneous figures 
  contained in Exhibit 6, a Support Mate calculation that had been prepared by 
  the appellant's counsel and was entered on consent of both parties. The error 
  overstated the appellant's income from employment. Her actual employment income 
  is $10,026 per year whereas the trial judge relied on an income figure of $16,500 
  per year. In our view, this error is patent on the face of the record and should 
  be rectified with the result that spousal support based on Exhibit 4L, scenario 
  2, in the amount of $400 a month is ordered.</p>
<p>[2] In making this order, we adhere to the trial judge's apparent desire to 
  equalize the parties' net disposable income. We are unable to accede to the 
  appellant's request to depart from an equalization approach to net disposable 
  income because there is an inadequate evidentiary basis on which to so proceed 
  and the appellant has clearly indicated that he does not seek the remedy of 
  a new trial.</p>
<p>[3] In the circumstances, there is no order as to costs.</p>
