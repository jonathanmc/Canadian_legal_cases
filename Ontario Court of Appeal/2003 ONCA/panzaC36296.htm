<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT CONCERNING COSTS</p>
<p>[1] The issues raised on this appeal were straightforward. We see no basis 
  for awarding costs on a substantial indemnity basis or in the amount requested 
  by the respondent. The only complicating factor was that it was necessary that 
  supplementary factums be filed concerning an issue not dealt with by the appellant 
  in his original factum. Accordingly, the costs of the appeal are awarded to 
  the respondent and are fixed at $10,000 on a partial indemnity scale, inclusive 
  of G.S.T. and disbursements.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] An order shall issue that, upon the respondent filing proof of the quantum 
  of the respondent's assessed costs of the trial, the balance of funds standing 
  in Court to the credit of this action shall be paid out of court in the following 
  priority: first, to the respondent's solicitor, in trust, on account of the 
  assessed costs of the trial and the fixed costs of this appeal; and second, 
  in the event that there is any remaining balance following payment of the respondent's 
  costs, to the appellant's solicitor, in trust.</p>
