<p>On appeal from the order dated September 27, 2002 of Justice Bruce C. Hawkins 
  of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting as a summary conviction appeal court 
  judge, overturning the conviction entered by Justice Thomas P. Cleary of the 
  Ontario Court of Justice dated January 31, 2002 and imposing a stay of proceedings.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] The Crown seeks leave to appeal and, if leave be granted, appeals the decision 
  of the summary conviction appeal court judge which allowed the respondent's 
  appeal from a conviction for sexual assault and imposed a stay of proceedings. 
  For the reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal and restore the conviction 
  imposed at trial.</p>
<p>
  (1) Facts</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent was charged with sexual assault. The Crown elected to proceed 
  summarily and the trial was scheduled for January 25, 2002 in the Ontario Court 
  of Justice. At a remand court hearing or &quot;informal&quot; judicial pre-trial 
  held on January 17, 2002, the respondent discharged his counsel. He sought production 
  of a videotape of the complainant's statement to the police, which had earlier 
  been provided to his counsel and seen by the respondent in his counsel's office. 
  When counsel was discharged by the respondent, he returned the videotape to 
  the Crown. The Crown took the position that, since the respondent was no longer 
  represented by counsel, the videotape would be made available for viewing by 
  the respondent at the Crown's office, but that the tape itself would not be 
  given to him. The presiding pre-trial judge felt that a copy of the videotape 
  should be provided to the respondent; however, he made no ruling in that regard. 
  Rather, he told the respondent to present his request for the videotape to the 
  trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [3] The trial was held before Cleary J., as scheduled, on January 25, 2002. 
  The respondent represented himself and was assisted by his son. The complainant 
  alleged that the respondent sexually assaulted her in her apartment by repeatedly 
  kissing her and touching her body. The respondent denied her version of events 
  and testified that it was the complainant who made sexual advances towards him. 
  Two brief references were made to the videotape by the respondent's son during 
  his cross-examination of the complainant on behalf of the respondent. Those 
  references concerned what the complainant had called the respondent in the videotape, 
  and her description of the respondent. There was no request by the respondent 
  for the production, or the viewing by the trial judge, of the videotape.</p>
<p>
  [4] On January 31, 2002, the respondent was found guilty of sexual assault and 
  received a suspended sentence, plus twelve months' probation.</p>
<p>
  [5] The respondent appealed his conviction to the summary conviction appeal 
  court by a notice of appeal dated February 26, 2002. One of the stated grounds 
  of appeal related to the videotape. Subsequently, the respondent also brought 
  an application to obtain a copy of the videotape. That application was dismissed 
  by Hamilton J. who endorsed on the application record that the appeal judge 
  could determine if production of the videotape was necessary.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appeal was heard before Hawkins J. on September 27, 2002. The appeal 
  was allowed and the proceedings were stayed. The entire endorsement of the summary 
  conviction appeal court judge reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Crown seeks to restrict the condition under which the videotape of the complainant's 
  statement may be viewed by the accused e.g. in the Crown's office during business 
  hours. This is allegedly a practice because of the &quot;sensitive&quot; nature 
  of sexual assault (and similar) proceedings. I see no reason why the accused's 
  access be so limited. This is the fourth appearance by the accused. In view 
  of this the appeal is allowed and the proceeding stayed. It might be useful 
  if the Crown appealed this ruling. </p>
<p>
  The Crown now appeals that ruling.</p>
<p>(2) The Disclosure Issue</p>
<p>
  [7] The videotape in question was provided by the Crown to counsel for the respondent 
  and was viewed by the respondent with his counsel prior to January 17, 2002. 
  After he was discharged by the respondent, defence counsel gave the videotape 
  back to the Crown. The Crown opposed the respondent's subsequent request for 
  production of a copy of the videotape, but offered to afford the respondent 
  an opportunity to view the videotape at the Crown's offices. The issue that 
  arises on this appeal is whether, in those circumstances, the Crown's disclosure 
  obligations concerning the complainant's videotaped statement were satisfied.</p>
<p>
  [8] The Crown's disclosure obligations in a criminal case are well-established. 
  The Crown has a legal duty to disclose all relevant information to the defence. 
  That duty, however, is not absolute. The Crown retains a discretion concerning 
  the withholding of information and the timing and manner of disclosure, and 
  regarding the relevance of information. The Crown's discretion in that connection 
  is reviewable by the trial judge, who must be guided by the controlling principle 
  that, unless non-disclosure is justified by the law of privilege, information 
  should not be withheld from the defence if there is a reasonable possibility 
  that the withholding will impair the right of an accused to make full answer 
  and defence: R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326 at paras. 11 and 19-21, 
  per Sopinka J.</p>
<p>
  [9] In this case, the Crown did not fail to make disclosure of the videotape 
  prior to trial. It did so prior to the discharge by the respondent of his trial 
  counsel. The evidence established that the respondent reviewed the videotape, 
  together with his counsel. Accordingly, as the Crown properly submits, the issue 
  here is not one of non-disclosure but, rather, the adequacy of the form of further 
  disclosure proposed by the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [10] The Crown submits that in sensitive cases involving allegations of sexual 
  abuse and a self-represented accused, as in this case, the Crown's disclosure 
  obligations are satisfied, and the public interest is fostered, by providing 
  the self-represented accused with an opportunity to view the videotaped statement 
  of a complainant at the Crown's office. On the facts of this case, we agree 
  with the Crown for the following reasons.</p>
<p>
  [11] The Crown relies upon the Report of the Attorney General's Advisory Committee 
  on Charge Screening, Disclosure and Resolution Discussions (1993), in which 
  the Crown's disclosure obligations to an unrepresented accused are addressed. 
  In that Report, the Advisory Committee recommends at p. 217: </p>
<p class="indent"> 9. (a) Defence counsel should not leave disclosure material 
  in the unsupervised possession of an accused person.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) An unrepresented accused is entitled to the same disclosure 
  as the represented accused. However, if there are reasonable grounds for concern 
  that leaving disclosure material with the unrepresented accused would jeopardize 
  the safety, security, privacy interests, or result in the harassment of any 
  person, Crown counsel may provide disclosure by means of controlled and supervised, 
  yet adequate and private, access to the disclosure materials. Incarcerated, 
  unrepresented accused persons are entitled to adequate and private access to 
  disclosure materials under the control and supervision of custodial authorities. 
  Crown counsel shall inform the unrepresented accused, in writing, of the appropriate 
  uses and limits upon the use of the disclosure materials [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [12] In its commentary to those recommendations, the Advisory Committee states 
  at pp. 218-19: </p>
<p class="indent"> It is a basic principle, of course, that the unrepresented 
  accused, like the accused who is represented, is entitled to full disclosure.</p>
<p class="indent">There is, however, one obvious difference between the represented 
  and the unrepresented accused that has a direct and practical bearing on disclosure. 
  Where an accused is unrepresented, there is no officer of the Court, acting 
  for the defence, who can ensure that the disclosure material is used only to 
  prepare to answer the charge, and not for some other improper purpose. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Ultimately, defence counsel, as an officer of the Court, is 
  expected to act responsibly. An unrepresented accused, however, is not required 
  to comply with professional standards. Providing full disclosure to an unrepresented 
  accused, when there is a reasonable basis for concern as outlined in paragraph 
  9(b), may, therefore, in the Committee's view, be accomplished in a somewhat 
  different manner.</p>
<p class="indent">The Committee has recommended that, where there is a reasonable 
  basis for concern that leaving disclosure materials with the unrepresented accused 
  would jeopardize the safety, security, privacy interests, or result in the harassment 
  of any person, Crown counsel should take such reasonable steps as are necessary 
  to prevent these harms, by providing private access to disclosure materials 
  (or copies thereof) in controlled conditions. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Where there is a reasonable basis for concern, which leads to 
  disclosure being made in a supervised setting as provided for in paragraph 9(b), 
  the accused must none the less be provided with full disclosure. Further, the 
  Committee wishes to emphasize that the supervision required in these circumstances 
  cannot impair the right of the accused to prepare, in a reasonable manner, to 
  meet the charge(s) he or she is facing. &#133; [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [13] The Advisory Committee also recommends, at p. 222 of its Report, that Crown 
  counsel should provide to the accused: &quot;[A] reasonable opportunity, in 
  private, to view and listen to the original or a copy of any audio or video 
  recordings of any statements made by a potential witness other than the accused.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [14] The disclosure recommendations of the Advisory Committee properly recognize, 
  and underscore, the harmful consequences that can flow from the improper use 
  of disclosure materials and the importance of preventing what the Committee 
  described at p. 218 of its Report as the risk of &quot;grave interference with 
  the administration of justice&quot;. The risk of harm from the improper use 
  of disclosure materials is particularly pronounced, in our view, in cases involving 
  sexual abuse. The Report of the Advisory Committee, in the context of such cases, 
  reflects the important public policy concern that sensitive materials, including 
  statements by complainants, not be exposed to misuse by unrepresented litigants 
  during or after pending criminal proceedings. For that reason, the Committee 
  endorsed the provision by the Crown to an unrepresented accused of private access 
  to disclosure materials, including videotaped witness statements, under controlled 
  circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [15] The approach urged by the Advisory Committee was adopted by the Crown in 
  this case. Disclosure of the videotape was first provided to the respondent 
  through his counsel. Thereafter, in accordance with the Report of the Advisory 
  Committee, the Crown offered to provide the respondent with another opportunity 
  to view the videotape under controlled conditions, that is, at the Crown's offices 
  during business hours.</p>
<p>
  [16] The Crown's proposal for the provision of further access to the videotape 
  was unobjectionable unless there was an evidentiary basis on the record before 
  the summary conviction appeal court judge to conclude that there was a reasonable 
  possibility that the respondent's right to make full answer and defence would 
  be impaired thereby. No such evidence was adduced by the respondent in this 
  case, nor was any challenge of the Crown's conduct brought by him under the 
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Moreover, although expressly informed by the 
  pre-trial judge of his ability to renew his production request before the trial 
  judge, the respondent failed to do so.</p>
<p> [17] In our view, therefore, there was no breach of the Crown's disclosure 
  obligations in this case concerning the complainant's videotaped statement. 
  The statement had already been disclosed and, when the respondent became self 
  represented, the proposed additional access to the videotape was in conformity 
  with the recommendations of the Advisory Committee's Report. The position of 
  the Crown was reasonable in the absence of any evidence of prejudice to the 
  respondent. In any event, it was open to the summary conviction appeal court 
  judge to order the production of the videotape if he believed that it was necessary 
  to permit the respondent to properly present his appeal and to make full answer 
  and defence. There was, however, no valid reason to allow the appeal.</p>
<p>
  (3) The Stay of Proceedings </p>
<p>
  [18] On the facts of this case, for the reasons given, it cannot be said that 
  the manner of disclosure was inadequate and constituted a breach of the respondent's 
  Charter rights. Even if it were otherwise, however, this case is not one of 
  those clearest of cases requiring the extreme remedy of a stay of proceedings. 
  The record does not support a conclusion that the respondent's right to make 
  full answer and defence was impaired, or that irreparable prejudice would result 
  to him under the Crown's production proposal. See R. v. Dixon, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 
  244. Thus, there was no evidentiary basis for the granting of any remedy under 
  s. 24(1) of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  (4) Disposition</p>
<p>
  [19] For these reasons, leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed. 
  The conviction imposed at trial is restored and the imposed stay of proceedings 
  is set aside. The appeal from conviction is remitted to the summary conviction 
  appeal court for disposition on the merits.</p>
