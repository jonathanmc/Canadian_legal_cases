<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The essence of the appellant's position is that the trial judge failed 
  to assess the Crown's case based on all of the evidence viewed in totality but, 
  rather, dealt with each issue related to the complainant's credibility separately. 
  He resolved each issue in favour of the complainant, thereby overlooking the 
  significance of the number of problems with her evidence on a cumulative basis. 
</p>
<p>[2] In our view, the trial judge's use of lengthy reasons and a seriatim approach 
  to the issues raised by the complainant's testimony was far from the optimal 
  way to deal with the case. Having said that, the trial judge was entitled, after 
  considering all of the evidence, to conclude that he accepted the complainant's 
  evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, and to discount or explain the inconsistencies 
  in her evidence. We are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in his assessment 
  of the complainant's evidence or in his conclusion that he was satisfied of 
  the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>[3] The appellant also appeals his sentence of ten years in total for the three 
  offences after taking into account the 482 days of pre-trial custody, which 
  the trial judge treated as two years. Although these offences are extremely 
  serious and egregious, we agree with the appellant's submission that the sentence 
  is beyond the range for these offences. We note that the trial judge exceeded 
  by a considerable margin the sentence suggested by Crown counsel at trial of 
  seven and a half years minus the 482 days of pre-trial custody on a one for 
  one basis. In our view, taking into account the pre-trial custody, an appropriate 
  sentence is six years. </p>
<p>[4] The appeal against conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence is 
  granted. The appeal against sentence is allowed and the sentence is reduced 
  to six years concurrent for each offence.</p>
