<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Charbonneau J. was correct to dismiss these appellants' application
  dated February 10, 2003. The relief sought in that application was exactly
  the same as the relief sought in the prior applications brought by these appellants,
which were heard by Lederman J. and disposed of by him on January 9, 2003. </p>
<p>[2]&nbsp; All the issues in the February 10, 2003 application were or could
  have been raised before Lederman J. </p>
<p>[3]&nbsp; The appeal is dismissed. </p>
