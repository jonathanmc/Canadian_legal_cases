<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] On January 9, 2003 Lederman J. granted a declaration that the Crown had 
  not answered the Constitutional issue decided by this Court in R. v. Parker 
  (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 482 and accordingly the regulations dealing with medical 
  use of marihuana were invalid. He suspended the declaration for six months to 
  July 9, 2003.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant seeks an order staying the judgment of Lederman J. pending 
  appeal. Arrangements are being made directed to an appeal hearing of this and 
  related appeals in late July but there is, of course, no certainty that the 
  issue will be resolved at that time. A stay would effectively extend the six 
  month suspension to the hearing date with no evidence or rationale supporting 
  doing so except that the appeal hearing is approaching.</p>
<p>
  [3] Lederman J. granted the postponement to enable something to be done, not 
  to enable an appeal to be completed. Why shouldn't his judgment take effect? 
  Is there prejudice? Is more time needed? No evidence is put forward to answer 
  these questions or to address why the six month period was inappropriate.</p>
<p>
  [4] The Crown's material supporting its application was confined to references 
  to one of the respondent's website where he chortled over the Crown's problems 
  in obtaining an appeal hearing before July 9th. There never was a realistic 
  chance for a hearing within the six months and this evidence is irrelevant to 
  this motion.</p>
<p>
  [5] The motion must be dismissed for want of supporting material or grounds 
  for the relief being sought. There will be no costs. </p>
