<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Antonio Dizio of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice, sitting without a jury, dated December 5, 2000.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals his conviction for one count of abduction of a child 
  under 14 contrary to section 283 of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant raises 3 grounds of appeal. They are first, failure of the 
  trial judge to adequately weigh the complainant's evidence having regard to 
  various inconsistencies in her testimony; second, whether the trial judge in 
  effect reversed the burden of proof; and third whether he erred in law in his 
  application of the defence of consent.</p>
<p>
  [3] With respect to the first ground of appeal the trial judge adverted to some 
  of the inconsistencies between the complainant's trial evidence and statements 
  she gave in affidavits filed in the family law matter. Having done so, he accepted 
  her explanation for the inconsistencies and found as a fact that she had not 
  consented to the child leaving the country. The trial judge was entitled to 
  make the finding he did. We would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [4] With respect to the second ground of appeal we are satisfied that, reading 
  the reasons as a whole, the trial judge did not err in his application of the 
  burden of proof. </p>
<p>
  [5] Finally, the appellant submits that in order to be found guilty, the Crown 
  had to prove more than lack of consent by the other parent. At the outset of 
  his reasons, the trial judge asked counsel whether the only issue was whether 
  or not the child had been removed without the consent of the other parent and 
  defence counsel agreed. The mental element of &quot;intent to deprive a parent&quot; 
  of possession of a child is established if the taker knows or foresees that 
  his or her actions would be certain or substantially certain to result in the 
  parent being deprived of the child. This case was not argued before the trial 
  judge on the basis that more than lack of consent was required to satisfy the 
  mental element. In any event, on this record, there is no air of reality to 
  the defence of lack of intent to deprive. There is ample evidence to support 
  the trial judge's decision. </p>
<p>
  [6] The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.</p>
