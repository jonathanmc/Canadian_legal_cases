<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice J. R. R. Jennings dated February 8, 
  2002.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from the dismissal of his action for damages for 
  injuries suffered when he was struck as a pedestrian by an unidentified motor 
  vehicle. </p><p>
  [2] The trial judge found that the appellant had little or no recall as to what 
  actually happened on the day in question. He suspected that the appellant's 
  lifestyle at the relevant time, which included a history of alcohol and substance 
  abuse, was the main reason for the &quot;extraordinary discrepancies&quot; in 
  his evidence on discovery and at trial and his lack of recollection. The trial 
  judge concluded that he could not rely on the appellant's evidence at all with 
  respect to the events on the day of the accident. However, the trial judge was 
  satisfied on the basis of the medical evidence that the appellant's injuries 
  were caused by a motor vehicle running over his left leg. </p><p>
  [3] It was the appellant's position at trial that the accident happened on a 
  public street, some distance away from the location where he had been found. 
  The trial judge rejected this evidence and found that the accident happened 
  where the appellant was found, namely in a vacant parking lot at the corner 
  of Victoria and Shuter Streets in Toronto. </p><p>
  [4] The question then arose whether the accident happened on a &quot;highway&quot; 
  so as to give rise to the reverse onus provision of s. 193(1) of the Highway 
  Traffic Act R.S.O. 1990, c. H-8. Under that provision, when loss or damage is 
  sustained by a person by reason of a motor vehicle on a highway, the onus of 
  proof that the injury did not arise through the negligence or improper conduct 
  of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle is upon the owner or driver. </p><p>
  [5] The trial judge found that the only evidence about the location where the 
  accident happened was that of the ambulance attendant who testified that it 
  was &quot;a private parking lot&quot;. He therefore concluded that s.193 did 
  not apply to this case. He further concluded that negligence could not be presumed 
  from the fact of the injury alone because there were &quot;any number of plausible 
  scenarios as to how the injury might have been received.&quot; The trial judge 
  therefore dismissed the action. </p><p>
  [6] The appellant concedes that the onus was on him to prove on a balance of 
  probabilities that the accident in fact happened on a highway within the meaning 
  of the Act before the onus shifted on the defendant to disprove negligence. 
  He argues that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence when he stated that 
  the ambulance attendant testified the lot was a &quot;private parking lot.&quot; 
  He submits that the trial judge then erred in concluding that the plaintiff 
  had failed to show that the parking lot constituted a highway within the meaning 
  of the Act. </p><p>
  [7] We recognize that the trial judge did not accurately describe the evidence 
  of the ambulance attendant when he stated that the parking lot was a &quot;private&quot; 
  parking lot. Rather, the transcript reveals that the ambulance attendant agreed 
  with the suggestions put to him by counsel that it was &quot;a vacant parking 
  lot&quot;, and that it was not part of the hospital facility located across 
  the street. Nonetheless, we are not persuaded that this error assists the appellant. 
  In our view, it was open to the trial judge to find, as in effect he did, that 
  the appellant had not met the onus of proving that the accident had happened 
  on a public highway. It is noteworthy on this point that the trial judge clearly 
  rejected the appellant's evidence and position with respect to the location 
  of the accident. </p><p>
  [8] We are further of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the 
  trial judge's conclusion that negligence could not be inferred from the injuries 
  alone and that, consequently, the appellant had failed to prove his claim at 
  trial. </p>
<p> [9] The appeal is dismissed. As the respondent seeks no costs, we make no 
  order as to costs. </p>
