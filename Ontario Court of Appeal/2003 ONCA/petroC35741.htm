<p>On appeal from the judgment of Judge F.A. Sargent from the Ontario Court of 
  Justice dated July 24, 2000.<br>
  <br>
  GOUDGE J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] This appeal raises two questions of law concerning the application of the 
  due diligence defence to a strict liability charge. The first is whether, to 
  engage the defence, the accused must prove the precise cause of the particular 
  event giving rise to the charge in order to show that the steps it took to prevent 
  that event constitute all reasonable care. The second, and more commonplace 
  question, involves the onus of establishing the defence, and who bears it.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The charge faced by the respondent Petro-Canada in this case was that it:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">On or about the 14th and 15th days of January 1993, 
  at or near 300-106th Street, in the City of Thunder Bay, in the District of 
  Thunder Bay, did commit the offence of discharging or causing or permitting 
  the discharge of a contaminant, namely gasoline, into the natural environment 
  that causes or was likely to cause an adverse effect, contrary to Section 14(1) 
  of the Environment Protection Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.19, as amended.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] At trial, Justice of the Peace Logan made a number of findings of fact. 
  He found that a spill of gasoline had occurred during the relevant dates at 
  Petro-Canada's premises in Thunder Bay. The spill resulted from the failure 
  of a pipe at the point where it was passing through an earthen berm. The spread 
  of the spilled gasoline was compounded by two of Petro-Canada's employees. One 
  employee had manipulated gasoline reconciliation records thereby disguising 
  the spill. The other employee had failed to close a valve upstream of the point 
  where the pipe failed.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven all the essential elements 
  of the offence. Having determined that this was a strict liability offence, 
  he then turned to the due diligence defence. He found that Petro-Canada had 
  a number of safety systems and procedures in place both to prevent a pipe failure 
  and, if it happened, to quickly detect it and mediate its effects.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] However, he said that he was unable to apply that defence in this case 
  because there was no evidence before him explaining why the pipe failed and 
  without that he could not determine if Petro-Canada had taken reasonable care. 
  He put his point this way at p. 6 of his reasons:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The test in reference to due diligence is to be applied 
  to this event, and I find I am unable to do this. I cannot because there is 
  no evidence before me on the subject of the cause of the failure. Was the failure 
  caused by say, corrosion, a frost heave, sabotage or mechanical accident? This 
  is unknown. </p>
<p>[6] Two pages later he reiterated the point: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Beyond this I have no evidence before me as to say for 
  example, the age of the pipes or their conformation to industry standards, if 
  in fact the standard exists, or the required industry precaution if any, for 
  pipe sections where they pass through berms, or anything on the condition of 
  the pipes beyond a somewhat casual observation of a crown witness that they 
  appeared in his estimation, to be in excellent condition.<br>
  I cannot apply the standard of that of a balance of probabilities, that is the 
  test in the application of due diligence, in reference to the efforts of Petro-Canada, 
  just listed, because I do not know why the pipe failed.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] The trial judge then went on to interpret R. v. ITT Industries of Canada 
  Ltd. (Ont. C.A. unreported April 13, 1993) as requiring that the precise cause 
  of the failure be proven by the accused in order for the defence to apply. Since 
  Petro-Canada had not done so in this case, the trial judge found that the defence 
  had not been made out. As a consequence, he concluded that it must be convicted.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] On appeal to the Ontario Court of Justice, Sargent J. concurred that this 
  is a strict liability offence and that the Crown had proven the required elements 
  of it.<br>
</p>
<p>[9] However, the appeal judge disagreed with the view of the trial judge that 
  the defence of due diligence could not be applied in this case because the cause 
  of the pipe failure was unknown. He then briefly reviewed the evidence heard 
  at trial about the safeguards that Petro-Canada had in place to prevent such 
  an accident and concluded that the defence of due diligence had been established 
  by saying the following at p. 6:<br>
  After reviewing the case law and all the facts as found by the Justice of the 
  Peace, this Court believes that a due diligence defense is made out in this 
  case, unless it was patently obvious that reasonable care amounting to due diligence 
  was not met or that it violated industry standards and/or statutory commitments.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] In the result, the appeal judge set aside the conviction and directed 
  an acquittal.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] Rosenberg J.A. found that this case raises the questions of law recited 
  above and therefore granted leave to this court.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] The first of these questions concerns the different views of the trial 
  judge and the appeal judge about the burden on the accused to establish the 
  precise cause of the pipe failure in order to raise a due diligence defence.<br>
</p>
<p>[13] The answer to this question must begin with the seminal judgment of Dickson 
  J. (as he then was) in Regina v. City of Sault Ste. Marie (1978), 40 C.C.C. 
  (2d) 353 (S.C.C.). There, as here, the accused was charged with discharging 
  or causing to be discharged certain polluting substances into a water system. 
  Dickson J. used this context to give recognition to a third category of offences, 
  in addition to those requiring proof of mens rea, and those of absolute liability 
  requiring mere proof of the prohibited act. The famous passage in which he did 
  so is at p. 374 and reads as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">2. Offences in which there is no necessity for the prosecution 
  to prove the existence of mens rea; the doing of the prohibited act prima facie 
  imports the offence, leaving it open to the accused to avoid liability by proving 
  that he took all reasonable care. This involves consideration of what a reasonable 
  man would have done in the circumstances. The defence will be available if the 
  accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would 
  render the act or omission innocent, or if he took all reasonable steps to avoid 
  the particular event. These offences may properly be called offences of strict 
  liability. [Emphasis added.]<br>
</p>
<p>[14] Dickson J. described the balance in this approach by saying that while 
  it relieved the Crown of the burden of proving mens rea, it also stopped short 
  of imposing absolute liability, which would deny an accused any defence whatsoever. 
  He explained the fairness of putting the burden on the accused to establish 
  the due diligence defence as follows at p. 373:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In a normal case, the accused alone will have knowledge 
  of what he has done to avoid the breach and it is not improper to expect him 
  to come forward with the evidence of due diligence.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] While, in the end, Dickson J. ordered a new trial, he did describe briefly 
  how the defence of reasonable care might operate in the context of the charge 
  in that case. At p. 377, he made clear that the question would be whether the 
  accused had negated its wilful involvement in the act charged and &quot;&#133;whether 
  the accused exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to 
  prevent commission of the offence and by taking reasonable steps to ensure the 
  effective operation of the system.&quot; The focus of the defence is the discharge 
  and the steps taken to prevent it.<br>
</p>
<p>[16] In my view, it is clear from Dickson J.'s reasoning that in a case like 
  this one, &quot;the particular event&quot; which the accused must show it has 
  taken all reasonable steps to avoid is the discharge of the polluting substance 
  into the particular water system. There is no suggestion in the language of 
  Dickson J. that the accused must first prove the precise cause of the discharge 
  before it can engage the defence of due diligence.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] Moreover, such a requirement would be inconsistent with the fairness described 
  by Dickson J. While the accused will know what it has done to avoid the discharge 
  and can fairly be asked to say so, the accused may well not know precisely how 
  the discharge came about. In my view, to require the accused to prove something 
  that may well be beyond its knowledge to trigger this defence moves this category 
  of offence closer to absolute liability than Dickson J. intended.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] The same approach is implicit in the language used by Catzman J.A. for 
  this court when he said this about the due diligence defence in Ontario v. London 
  Excavators &amp; Trucking Ltd. (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 32 (C.A.) at 36:<br>
  It is common ground between the parties that the offence with which the appellant 
  was charged is one of strict liability. Once the actus reus of a strict liability 
  offence is proved, a conviction must follow unless the accused establishes that 
  it exercised due diligence to avoid the commission of the offence.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] Returning to this case, the offence charged is that the accused discharged 
  or caused to be discharged a contaminant, namely gasoline, into the natural 
  environment that caused, or was likely to cause, an adverse effect. Once the 
  Crown proves this, the accused can successfully defend itself by showing on 
  a balance of probabilities that it took all reasonable steps to avoid or prevent 
  the discharge. The &quot;particular event&quot; is discharging or causing the 
  discharge of gasoline as described in the charge.<br>
</p>
<p>[20] For these reasons I do not think that the law requires the accused to 
  prove precisely how the discharge came about - in this case precisely why the 
  pipe failed - in order to avail itself of the due diligence defence. On the 
  other hand, in a case where the accused can do this, it may be able to narrow 
  the range of preventative steps that it must show to establish that it took 
  all reasonable care. However where, as here, the accused cannot prove the precise 
  cause of the pipe failure the due diligence defence is not rendered unavailable 
  as a result. That being said, it must be emphasized that to invoke the defence 
  successfully in such circumstances, the accused must show that it took all reasonable 
  care to avoid any foreseeable cause. <br>
</p>
<p>[21] In my view, the ITT case, supra, is not inconsistent with this approach. 
  In that case the accused was charged with permitting the discharge of a contaminant. 
  The exact cause of the discharge was undetermined. The accused attempted unsuccessfully 
  to establish due diligence simply by showing that it had purchased and installed 
  the best equipment and that the recording devices on this equipment showed no 
  breakdown.<br>
</p>
<p>[22] In denying leave to appeal, Carthy J.A. noted that the latter evidence 
  leads nowhere once a discharge is established. He went on to indicate that the 
  due diligence defence was flawed in this case by the failure to demonstrate 
  what happened, why, and what steps were taken to prevent the occurrence in the 
  functioning of the plant on that day. In saying this Carthy J.A. was not making 
  proof of the precise cause of the discharge a legal prerequisite to the due 
  diligence defence. He is simply saying that the defendant must go beyond the 
  purchase and installation of the best equipment to show what steps were taken 
  to prevent the discharge on that day and that these steps constitute reasonable 
  care, something which may be more easily demonstrated if it can be shown how 
  the discharge occurred.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] Thus my answer to the first question of law is that the defendant need 
  not establish the precise cause of the pipe failure in order to successfully 
  raise a due diligence defence. I conclude that the appeal judge was correct 
  in finding that the trial judge erred in concluding otherwise.<br>
</p>
<p>[24] The second question of law referred to by Rosenberg J.A. arises from the 
  passage quoted earlier from the reasons of the appeal judge and relates to the 
  onus of proving due diligence.<br>
</p>
<p>[25] Before turning to this issue, it appears that the quoted passage reveals 
  another error of law. The appeal judge finds that the evidence indicates that 
  the Petro-Canada terminal met all statutory and regulatory requirements and 
  had a safety system that met industry standards. The findings of fact by the 
  trial judge were exactly to the contrary in that there was no evidence that 
  the pipes met industry standards. It was not open to the appeal judge to retry 
  this aspect of the case.<br>
</p>
<p>[26] More importantly, however, the appeal judge said that the due diligence 
  defence is made out unless it is patently obvious that reasonable care amounting 
  to due diligence was not met or that it violated industry standards and/or statutory 
  commitments. <br>
</p>
<p>[27] This clearly appears to place the onus of disproving due diligence on 
  the Crown. As well it suggests that only where the care taken falls so much 
  short of the &quot;all reasonable steps&quot; requirement that this shortcoming 
  is &quot;patently obvious&quot; will the defence fail. In both these respects 
  the appeal judge departs from the law as set out in R. v. Sault Ste. Marie, 
  supra, where it is made clear that the onus is on the defendant to establish, 
  on a balance of probabilities, that it took all reasonable steps to avoid the 
  particular event. Thus, in both respects, I think the appeal judge erred in 
  law. His finding that the due diligence defence has been made out cannot stand.<br>
</p>
<p>[28] I would, therefore, conclude that while the appeal judge was correct to 
  set aside the conviction at trial, he erred in law in directing an acquittal. 
  Regrettably, given the length of time that has passed, the appeal must be allowed 
  and a new trial directed.</p>
