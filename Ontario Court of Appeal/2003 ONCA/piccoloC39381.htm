<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Mrs. Piccolo advances three main submissions on behalf of her husband and 
  herself:</p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The motions judge erred in failing to find that the appellants' 
  affidavit material raised a triable issue about whether the respondent Muroff 
  breached a fiduciary duty to Mr. and Mrs. Piccolo;</p>
<p class="indent">2. The motions judge erred in granting summary judgment in the 
  face of genuine credibility issues requiring a trial; and</p>
<p class="indent">3. The motions judge should not have granted summary judgment 
  because the respondent refused to give the appellants his file on their mortgage 
  transactions.</p>
<p>
  We decline to give effect to any of these grounds of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [2] On the first submission, the appellants' allegations of breach of fiduciary 
  duty are conclusory at best. Even accepting that the respondent Muroff had a 
  fiduciary duty to the appellants, they have put forward no material facts to 
  show that the respondent breached his duty or that any acts or omissions by 
  him caused the appellants' damages. </p>
<p>
  [3] The undeniable fact is that the appellants did not have the financial means 
  to maintain the property. They defaulted on each of the three mortgages, they 
  could not pay the municipal taxes and they could not find a buyer. The sale 
  to LeBlanc did not close apparently because of the purchaser's inability to 
  pay the purchase price. Nothing in the record suggests that Mr. Muroff prevented 
  the sale from taking place. </p>
<p>
  [4] On the appellants' second submission, we see no credibility issues that 
  need to be resolved by a trial. The motions judge was entitled to take a hard 
  look at the record and his conclusion that the material did not raise a genuine 
  triable issue seems to us unassailable. </p>
<p>
  [5] On the appellants' third submission, we note that they had a lawyer at the 
  time who did not request the file from the respondent; that six days before 
  the motion, the respondent's solicitor offered to make the file available for 
  inspection and copying but the appellants declined to take up the offer; and 
  that the appellants have not shown any prejudice from not having the file. </p>
<p>
  [6] For these brief reasons the appeal is dismissed. The respondent is entitled 
  to his costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis, which we fix at $4,000 
  plus disbursements and GST.</p>
