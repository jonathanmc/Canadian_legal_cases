<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Archie G. Campbell of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 23, 2002.<br>
</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from the dismissal of its application for an order 
  quashing a search warrant issued on January 2, 2001, and declaring that s. 487 
  of the Criminal Code, to the extent that it authorizes the search of law offices 
  and the seizure of documents therein, is unconstitutional and of no force and 
  effect. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] The appellant urged this court, as it was urged upon the applications judge, 
  to endorse the reasoning of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Festing 
  (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 97, and to declare s. 487 unconstitutional in respect 
  of law offices on the ground that the solicitor-client privilege could not be 
  adequately protected by the discretion afforded the issuing justice to impose 
  appropriate conditions in accordance with common law principles. The applications 
  judge rejected this argument and concluded as follows: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">For the reasons given in Festing by Romilly J. at first instance at para. 102 
  -107 I conclude that s. 487 is constitutional in respect of law office searches 
  so long as the search complies with the procedures mandated by the Ontario Court 
  of Appeal in this case and complied with in this case. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] We agree with this conclusion. Further, it is our view that the recent 
  decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lavallee (2002), 167 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) confirms that the constitutional imperatives for the protection 
  of solicitor-client privilege can be adequately met through the application 
  of common law principles relating to the issuance of search warrants. Counsel 
  correctly noted that the constitutionality of s. 488.1, and not s. 487, was 
  in issue in Lavallee; however, he was unable to articulate why s. 487, if applied 
  in conformity with the principles in that case, would be unconstitutional. It 
  is our view that s. 487 of the Criminal Code is constitutional in respect of 
  law offices provided that the guidelines set out in Lavallee (at para. 49) are 
  followed. <br>
</p>
<p>[4] In his oral submissions, counsel for the appellant argued, in the alternative, 
  that the Lavallee principles were not adequately complied with in this case. 
  In our view, there was no evidentiary basis to support counsel's alternative 
  argument. <br>
</p>
<p>[5] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed. </p>
