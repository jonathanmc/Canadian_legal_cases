<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] In refusing the application to transfer the charge of first degree murder
  to the Youth Court, the transfer judge gave very careful and thorough reasons.
  In our view, there was ample evidence to support the important findings of
  fact made by the transfer judge. We are not persuaded that he misapprehended
  or ignored any of the material evidence.</p>
<P> [2] Accepting those findings of fact, as we must, we agree with the transfer
      judge's conclusion that the appellant has not discharged the onus
      of showing that the public can be adequately protected through the disposition
      scheme established under the Young Offenders Act. The appeal is, therefore,
  dismissed.</p>
