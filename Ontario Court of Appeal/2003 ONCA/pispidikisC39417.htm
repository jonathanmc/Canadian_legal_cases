<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant, John Pispidikis, appeals from the judgment of Rouleau J., 
  dated December 18, 2002, striking out the claims against various defendants 
  in an action, including a justice of the peace, two correctional officers and 
  the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appeal, and the action, arise out of an unfortunate error in recording 
  the sentence imposed on the appellant after he pleaded guilty to the office 
  of driving with a suspended licence in violation of s. 53(1) of the Highway 
  Traffic Act. The justice of the peace, the respondent G. Donald Scroggie, recorded 
  the guilty plea and orally imposed the minimum fine of $1000 plus court costs 
  of $5, with one year to pay. Unfortunately, the sentence recorded on the information 
  placed the words "1 year" next to the typed words "sentenced 
  to imprisonment for" rather than next to the typed words "Time to 
  pay". Eight days later, the same justice of the peace signed a committal 
  warrant for the appellant's committal which repeated the error that the 
  appellant had been sentenced to a one year term of imprisonment. The appellant 
  was arrested and taken to jail where he alleges that he was beaten by other 
  prisoners. A week later, an emergency appeal was heard, the Crown asked that 
  the charges be withdrawn, and Judge Paris allowed the appeal and dismissed the 
  charges.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant commenced an action, essentially for wrongful arrest and imprisonment, 
  against the justice of the peace, three police officers, a police chief, three 
  correctional officers and the Crown. On a series of Rule 21 motions, the motions 
  judge struck out the claims against the justice of the peace, two of the correctional 
  officers, the Crown in relation to potential vicarious liability for the actions 
  of the justice of the peace and the two correctional officers, and certain of 
  the claims against the police chief. The appellant appeals these components 
  of the motions judge's decision. </p>
<p>
  [4] At the outset of oral argument, the appellant abandoned his appeal from 
  the motions judge's order striking the claims of vicarious liability as 
  against the Crown and the police chief.</p>
<p>
  [5] In our view, the appeal can be disposed of readily. We agree with the motions 
  judge that in connection with the justice of the peace, the appellant did not 
  meet his obligation under the Rules of Civil Procedure to plead malice or bad 
  faith with particularity. Both are simply left, on the appellant's pleading, 
  as bald allegations. The pleading of the signing by the justice of the peace 
  of the committal warrant and of his writing on the sentence report can serve 
  as no support for, or evidence of, malice or bad faith. </p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant can point to nothing else. Thus, even if the immunity accorded 
  to a judicial official in the conduct of his duties could be displaced by a 
  properly pleaded claim based on malice or bad faith, it is plain and obvious 
  that this is not such a case.</p>
<p>
  [7] Similarly, on the appellant's pleading, we see no basis on which to 
  interfere with the motions judge's decision concerning the two correctional 
  officers against whom the appellant's claims were struck.</p>
<p>
  [8] We also see no reason to interfere with the motions judge's refusal 
  to permit the appellant to further amend his pleading to allege, on the same 
  asserted facts, breaches of the appellant's rights under the Charter of 
  Rights and Freedoms as against the defendants in respect of whom the appellant's 
  claims have been struck. For clarity, this does not prevent the appellant, if 
  so advised, from seeking to amend his pleading to advance Charter claims against 
  the remaining defendants.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appeal is dismissed, with costs to the respondent G. Donald Scroggie 
  and the Crown fixed at $2500 and $2500 respectively, both inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST. The enforcement of these costs awards is suspended until the final 
  disposition of the action against the remaining defendants.</p>
