<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] With respect to the conduct of Crown counsel, specifically, his sarcastic 
  questions and observations, no doubt they reflected badly on Crown counsel but 
  we are far from persuaded that the number of the incidents and nature of what 
  was said resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>
  [2] Respecting the &quot;McNeil&quot; point, assuming that the comments of Crown 
  counsel and the trial judge's statement reflected an error, we are satisfied 
  that they occasioned no prejudice to the appellant. It would have been obvious 
  to the jury that Stevenson would have denied any assault on Fidler and there 
  was no pre-charge or post-charge objection to the charge as given.</p>
<p>
  [3] With respect to self-defence and the issue raised respecting provocation, 
  we are satisfied that it would have been obvious to the jury that there was 
  no evidence of provocation. Accordingly, the trial judge's failure to so instruct 
  the jury would have resulted in no prejudice. There was no objection to the 
  charge on this point.</p>
<p>
  [4] The remaining point with respect to self-defence is based on the trial judge's 
  misstatement of the evidence on page 742 in volume 3 of the transcript. This 
  misstatement was corrected by what the trial judge said to the jury both before 
  and after this passage and, again, there was no objection to the charge.</p>
<p>
  [5] In the result, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
