<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Both parties acknowledge that the damages awarded by the jury were so high 
  as to justify our intervention. Based on the helpful submissions of counsel, 
  on the evidence of the experts and of the family's circumstances, and given 
  the ranges usually awarded for non-pecuniary damages, we would substitute the 
  following awards:</p>

<p>[2] We do not read the decision of this court in Padfield v. Martin as requiring 
  us to consider the offers to settle in assessing the damages, and, in the circumstances 
  of this case, do not feel it would be appropriate to do so.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, and the damages are varied in accordance 
  with these reasons. On consent, there will be no order for costs.</p>
