<p>On appeal from the summary conviction imposed by Justice Barry G. A. MacDougall 
  of the Superior Court of Justice dated May 22, 2003 reported at [2003] O. J. 
  No. 2021.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] We see no reason to interfere with the decision of the summary conviction 
  appeal judge in this matter. The appeal judge correctly identified the key issue 
  as that of mens rea. He also correctly identified and applied the appropriate 
  test as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. King, [1962] S.C.R. 
  746. He concluded that there was evidence upon which the trial judge could make 
  his findings of fact and that, on the totality of evidence, the trial judge's 
  determinations could not be said to be unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  [2] There was sufficient evidence for the appeal judge to conclude that the 
  appellant could reasonably have been expected to foresee the consequences of 
  his actions and/or that he was reckless in having assumed the risk that he might 
  have become impaired. In the circumstances of this case, there is no need to 
  decide whether recklessness is a necessary component of the analysis. In the 
  circumstances of this case, there is no need to decide whether recklessness 
  is a necessary component of the analysis.</p>
<p> [3] In coming to his conclusions, the appeal judge noted the following findings 
  of fact: </p>
<ul>
  <li> within months preceding the incident, the appellant experienced two significant 
    changes in his medication: both the dosage and rate of daily consumption were 
    significantly increased;</li>
  <li> shortly before the incident, the appellant had experienced losses of memory 
    that he thought could be caused by the increased medication;</li>
  <li> the appellant failed to make any inquiry of his doctor of the connection 
    between his memory gaps and the increased use of the medication; </li>
  <li>the appellant admitted that he knew the drug could make him drowsy; and</li>
  <li> on the date of the incident, the appellant had consumed either the maximum 
    dosage or an amount close to the maximum dosage before getting into his car 
    to go shopping.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [4] We see no basis upon which to interfere with the decision of the summary 
  conviction appeal court and would, therefore, dismiss the appeal. </p>
