  Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20 (the &quot;CCRA&quot;), contained in this court's judgment 
  dated December 4, 2002 in this case, are in error. All references to that section 
  should be references to s. 125(1)(a)(ii) of the CCRA.</p><p>
  [2] Accordingly, the reference to s. 125(1)(b) of the CCRA in paragraph 19 of 
  the judgment dated December 4, 2002 is hereby deleted, and replaced with a reference 
  to s. 125(1)(a)(ii) of the CCRA. In addition, the terms of s. 125(1)(b) of the 
  CCRA, as quoted in paragraph 19 of the judgment, are deleted, and replaced with 
  the following:</p>
<p class="indent"> 125(1) This section and section 126 apply to an offender 
  sentenced, committed or transferred to penitentiary for the first time, otherwise 
  than pursuant to an agreement entered into under paragraph 16(1)(b), other than 
  an offender</p>
<p class="indent">(a) serving a sentence for one of the following offences, 
  namely, </p>
<p class="indent15"> (ii) an offence set out in Schedule 1,</p>
<p class="indent15">&#133; </p>
<p class="indent15">(vi) a criminal organization offence within the meaning of 
  section 2 of the Criminal Code, including an offence under subsection 82(2);</p>
<p>[3] Paragraph 20 of the judgment dated December 4, 2002 refers to s. 1(a) of 
  Schedule 1 of the CCRA. The wording of that section, as quoted in paragraph 
  20, is deleted, and replaced with the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. An offence under any of the following provisions 
  of the Criminal Code, that was prosecuted by way of indictment:</p>
<p class="indent15"> (a) paragraph 81(2)(a) (causing injury with intent);</p>
<p>
  [4] Paragraphs 21, 24, 26, 27, 30, 31, 32 and 33 of the judgment dated December 
  4, 2002 each contain references to s. 125(1)(b) of the CCRA. In each instance, 
  the reference to s. 125(1)(b) is deleted, and replaced with a reference to s. 
  125(1)(a)(ii) of the CCRA. </p><p>
  [5] In all other respects, the judgment of this court dated December 4, 2002 
  remains unchanged.</p><p>
