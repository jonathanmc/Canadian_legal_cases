<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant asserts that he did not understand the potential consequences 
  of his guilty pleas until he saw and reviewed the complainant's victim impact 
  statement with the result that the trial judge erred by declining to allow him 
  to withdraw his pleas. In our view, the trial judge did not err. </p>
<p>[2] The appellant bears the onus of proving that his pleas were invalid. There 
  is no evidence on the record before us that the appellant did not appreciate 
  the nature of the charges or the fact that he would be sentenced in respect 
  to those charges. The fact that the appellant may have wished, after his pleas, 
  to take issue with some of the comments made in the complainant's victim impact 
  statement that were unrelated to the essential elements of the offence is not 
  a ground to set aside the pleas.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
