<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice A.J. Abbey of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated May 29 and 31, 1999 and from the 
  sentences imposed on August 30 and 31, 1999.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellants, Wilfredo Portillo and Noe Portillo, were convicted of second 
  degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole 
  for 12 years. They appeal conviction and sentence. </p>
<p> [2] The grounds of appeal fall into three groups: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the reasonableness of the verdicts;</li>
  <li>the admissibility of certain evidence tendered by the Crown; and</li>
  <li>the correctness of the trial judge's instructions to the jury.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge erred in admitting what was described as the &quot;footwear&quot; 
  evidence. This error necessitates the quashing of both convictions. I am satisfied 
  that the admissible evidence does provide a basis upon which a reasonable jury, 
  properly instructed, could convict the appellants. Consequently, I would quash 
  the convictions and order a new trial.</p>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  [4] The deceased was strangled to death. The Crown claimed that the two appellants, 
  acting together, killed him and stole property from his apartment. The Crown's 
  case was entirely circumstantial. The appellants did not testify and did not 
  call a defence.</p>
<p>
  [5] The deceased was in his early fifties and was partially disabled by a stroke. 
  He was found dead on the morning of May 2, 1998 lying on the floor beside his 
  bed in his small apartment. There was a cushion over his head and some linen 
  and a cloth over his body. His underwear was around his ankles. There was a 
  white extension cord around the deceased's neck with a bicycle handle bar wrapped 
  into the cord at the back of the neck, presumably to facilitate the use of the 
  cord to strangle the deceased. </p>
<p>
  [6] There was no sign of forced entry into the apartment, or of any scuffle 
  in the living room. The bedroom was in disarray, but there was evidence that 
  this was not unusual.</p>
<p>
  [7] The deceased was a heavy drinker and his blood/alcohol level at the time 
  of his death was .400. He was known to entertain in his apartment and there 
  was often a lot of drinking. The appellants knew the deceased and had been in 
  his apartment before the night of the homicide. </p>
<p>
  [8] The appellants began drinking with a group of men in the early evening of 
  Friday, May 1. Noe Portillo went to the deceased's apartment about 7:00 p.m. 
  on Friday night with some vodka to visit the deceased. A friend of the deceased 
  was visiting with him when Noe Portillo arrived. There was some evidence that 
  the deceased did not want Noe in his apartment. Noe left about a half an hour 
  later indicating that he would return. </p>
<p>
  [9] The friend of the deceased left at about 11:00 p.m. He put the deceased 
  to bed, tidied the apartment and left locking the main door. He left the patio 
  door slightly ajar and blocked it with a piece of wood. This same friend found 
  the body the next morning at about 11:00 a.m. The patio door was open.</p>
<p>
  [10] There was considerable circumstantial evidence from which it could be inferred 
  that the appellants were in the deceased's apartment drinking beer after 1:30 
  a.m. on Saturday morning. The Thrashers, neighbours of the deceased, heard the 
  deceased quarrelling with someone between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on Saturday 
  morning. It was open to the jury to infer that the appellants were present when 
  this quarrel took place. There was also evidence from which it could be inferred 
  that whoever was visiting the deceased in the early morning hours of Saturday, 
  May 2 left in a hurry leaving full bottles of beer on the table and the stove 
  turned on. </p>
<p>
  [11] The Crown led evidence of certain hairs found in the deceased's apartment. 
  One scalp hair, which matched Noe Portillo's DNA profile, was found somewhere 
  on the deceased's underwear. A second scalp hair matching Noe Portillo's DNA 
  profile was found on the bedroom floor near the deceased's body. A body hair 
  matching Wilfredo Portillo's DNA profile was found on the skin of the deceased 
  high on his thigh near the buttocks. Hair that was microscopically similar to 
  Wilfredo Portillo's scalp hair was found on the back of the deceased's sweater. 
  Three scalp hairs that were microscopically similar to the deceased's hair were 
  found on pillowcases seized from the apartment of Wilfredo. These pillowcases 
  were similar in pattern to pillowcases found in the deceased's apartment.</p>
<p>
  [12] The defence challenged the &quot;hair&quot; evidence in two ways. First, 
  they established through cross-examination that hair could be transferred from 
  one surface to another with relative ease. The deceased was sitting in his living 
  room in his underwear the night before he was killed and he could have picked 
  up hairs from the furniture both on his underwear and on his thigh just below 
  the buttocks. The defence also sought to establish that the crime scene had 
  not been properly safeguarded and that there was considerable potential for 
  contamination before the forensic samples were retrieved.</p>
<p>
  [13] The admissibility of the &quot;hair&quot; evidence was not contested at 
  trial. On appeal, counsel contend that the evidence that certain hairs were 
  microscopically similar to the hair of the deceased and the appellants should 
  have been excluded. </p>
<p>
  [14] The deceased owned a red bicycle that, according to his friend, was in 
  the deceased's apartment at 11:00 p.m. on May 1 when the friend left. That bicycle 
  was in the possession of Wilfredo Portillo on May 4. Wilfredo Portillo was seen 
  taking the bicycle from his apartment to a field and hiding it under a piece 
  of plywood. Immediately before leaving his apartment with the bicycle, Wilfredo 
  Portillo had been visited by his brother, Noe Portillo.</p>
<p>
  [15] A green bicycle belonging to the deceased was recovered from the basement 
  of Noe Portillo's apartment. There was no evidence as to when or how this bicycle 
  came into Noe Portillo's possession. </p>
<p>
  [16] There was some evidence from which it could be inferred, that some cash, 
  a wallet and a bank card were taken from the deceased on the night of his death. 
  None of this property was recovered. </p>
<p>
  [17] Home sewn pillow cases were seized from Wilfredo Portillo's apartment. 
  Forensic examination revealed that the thread used in those pillowcases were 
  similar to thread used in home sewn pillowcases found in the deceased's apartment. 
  The pillowcases also had the same floral print design.</p>
<p>
  [18] A few pieces of costume jewellery were found in clothing belonging to Wilfredo 
  Portillo. On cross-examination, the defence elicited evidence from the police 
  officer who seized that jewellery, that an expert had examined the jewellery 
  and compared it to costume jewellery found in the deceased's apartment. After 
  some discussion among counsel and the trial judge, that expert was called by 
  the Crown. The expert described the jewellery as mass-produced women's costume 
  jewellery having minimal value. He said there was a general similarity in value 
  and quality between the jewellery found in the deceased's apartment and the 
  jewellery found in the possession of Wilfredo Portillo. The expert acknowledged 
  that jewellery of that kind was very common. </p>
<p>
  [19] There was no objection taken to the admissibility of the &quot;jewellery&quot; 
  evidence at trial. On appeal, counsel submit that the evidence should have been 
  excluded. </p>
<p>
  [20] The police found two Addidas running shoes in the vicinity of Wilfredo 
  Portillo's apartment. An expert testified that impressions taken of the treads 
  of those running shoes were similar to two partial footprints found at the scene 
  of the homicide. The admissibility of the &quot;footwear&quot; evidence was 
  objected to at trial and that objection is renewed on appeal. I will describe 
  the &quot;footwear&quot; evidence in more detail when I consider that ground 
  of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [21] Mrs. Thrasher, one of the deceased's neighbours who heard arguing between 
  4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. on May 2, testified that she recognized one of the voices 
  as that of Noe Portillo. The day after Mrs. Thrasher gave this evidence, counsel 
  argued that this evidence was improperly before the jury and moved for a mistrial. 
  After that motion was rejected, counsel eventually took the position that the 
  trial judge should expressly instruct the jury that the purported voice identification 
  of Mrs. Thrasher had no probative value. That position is renewed on appeal. 
  I will address the voice identification evidence in more detail when I consider 
  that ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  The Admissibility Issues</p>
<p>
  (i) The &quot;footwear&quot; evidence</p>
<p>
  [22] In the course of the investigation at the homicide scene, the police found 
  an envelope under the deceased's head with blood on it and a partial shoe print 
  beside the blood. They found a second partial shoe print in the mud outside 
  of the patio door of the deceased's apartment. Two days later, a police officer 
  found two Addidas running shoes in the vicinity of Wilfredo Portillo's apartment. 
  One was found in an alley about 15 feet to the right of a set of stairs leading 
  to Mr. Portillo's apartment. Those stairs provide access to other apartments 
  as well. This running shoe was closer to the door leading to the apartment next 
  to Wilfredo Portillo's apartment. The second Addidas running shoe was found 
  in the entrance to the same alley about 20 feet away from the first running 
  shoe. It was on a boulevard in front of an auto body shop. The two running shoes 
  were the same brand, colour and size. Both appeared to have been worn. One shoe 
  had a lace, the other did not. </p>
<p>
  [23] There was no evidence that Wilfredo Portillo had ever worn running shoes 
  like those found in the vicinity of his apartment. There was no evidence that 
  Wilfredo's feet were capable of fitting into the shoes. Although there were 
  apparently tests which could be performed to determine whether shoes had been 
  regularly worn by an individual, those tests were not conducted in this case. 
  The police did not canvass the area where the shoes were found or take any other 
  investigative steps to try and locate the owner or owners of the shoes.</p>
<p>
  [24] An expert compared photographic impressions taken of the treads of the 
  recovered running shoes with photographic impressions of the footprints found 
  at the scene. He testified that the patterns on the treads of the shoes were 
  similar in size, shape and orientation to the patterns found in the footprints. 
  The expert observed no accidental characteristics on the treads of the shoes 
  or footprint impressions which would allow him to make a more definitive comparison. 
  The expert had no idea how many shoes had the same tread pattern as the running 
  shoes found in the vicinity of Wilfredo's apartment. He could not say whether 
  other types of Addidas running shoes had that same pattern and he could not 
  say whether other brands of running shoes had that same pattern. </p>
<p>
  [25] The footwear evidence was tendered as part of a package of circumstantial 
  evidence from which the Crown asked the jury to ultimately infer that the appellants 
  participated in the deceased's killing. If it was reasonably open to the jury 
  to find that the partial footprint on the envelope under the deceased's head 
  was made by Wilfredo, that inference provided cogent evidence of Wilfredo's 
  involvement in the killing.</p>
<p>
  [26] The use to which the Crown urged the jury to put the &quot;footwear&quot; 
  evidence is set out in counsel's closing address. He said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  What other evidence do we have connected to that apartment? [Wilfredo's apartment] 
  Well, you have those two blue running shoes. You have the evidence and the photographs 
  as to where they were located outside apartment nine. Yes, there's other people 
  that live in and around that apartment building and yes there's obviously a 
  lot of Addidas shoes with a similar tread pattern, but there was no evidence 
  that those people left their finger and hand impressions on beer bottles, on 
  a wine glass in Ted Purchla's apartment [the deceased], left their DNA on a 
  cigarette, left their hair on the victim's body. Putting that all together, 
  I submit you can find that those shoes are connected to Wilfredo Portillo. What 
  are their significance? Well, you've heard the evidence of the yellow coloured 
  envelope with a shoe impression, part of a impression on that envelope that 
  is similar to those Addidas shoes, just similar, not a positive identification 
  like a fingerprint. It is just similar. Another coincidence? That's for you 
  to decide [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [27] In holding that the evidence was admissible, the trial judge considered 
  probative value and potential prejudicial effect. He concluded that the evidence 
  had some probative value, although he acknowledged that the fact that the shoes 
  were not found in Wilfredo's possession, diminished their probative value. The 
  trial judge also concluded that there was no potential prejudicial effect. He 
  said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; There is no potential unfairness to the accused in the sense that this 
  evidence if introduced might be used by the jury for other than its intended 
  and proper purpose.</p>
<p>
  [28] On appeal, Mr. Downes, for the Crown, argued that the &quot;footwear&quot; 
  evidence was potentially powerful circumstantial evidence placing Wilfredo Portillo 
  in very close proximity to the body when the homicide occurred. Mr. Downes submitted, 
  quite correctly, that as the evidence was but one part of the Crown's circumstantial 
  case its relevance and ultimate probative value had to be assessed in the context 
  of the rest of the circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>
  [29] The Crown's argument both at trial and on appeal as to the probative value 
  of the &quot;footwear&quot; evidence is seductive. I agree, however, with Ms. 
  Oleskiw's contention that the Crown's argument as to the relevance of the evidence 
  is ultimately based on circular reasoning. </p>
<p> [30] The &quot;footwear&quot; evidence consisted of two primary facts: </p>
<ul>
  <li>two partial shoe prints found at the scene were similar to impressions from 
    two shoes found by the police in the course of their investigation; and</li>
  <li>the shoes were found in the vicinity of Wilfredo Portillo's apartment. </li>
</ul>
<p> [31] The &quot;footwear&quot; evidence was relevant if it could reasonably 
  be inferred from those primary facts, considered in the context of the rest 
  of the evidence, that Wilfredo Portillo was at the scene of the homicide in 
  close proximity to the body. That conclusion could be drawn only if these two 
  inferences were reasonably available from the &quot;footwear&quot; evidence: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the shoes found by the police made the prints at the scene; and</li>
  <li>the shoes belonged to Wilfredo Portillo.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  [32] The &quot;footwear&quot; evidence had relevance only if both of the above 
  inferences could be drawn. With respect to the first inference, that the shoes 
  made the prints found at the scene, other evidence (e.g. hair and fingerprint 
  evidence) connecting the appellant to the scene could only help in concluding 
  that the shoes made the prints if the trier of fact had already drawn the second 
  inference and concluded that the shoes belonged to Wilfredo Portillo. Without 
  that latter inference, evidence that Wilfredo Portillo was at the scene had 
  no logical connection to the question of whether those shoes made the prints. 
  With respect to the second inference, that the shoes belonged to Wilfredo Portillo, 
  evidence of the comparison between the prints found at the scene and the impressions 
  from the shoes could assist in connecting those shoes to Wilfredo Portillo only 
  if the jury had already drawn the first inference and concluded the shoes in 
  fact made the prints at the scene. </p>
<p>
  [33] The &quot;footwear&quot; evidence could assist in proving either of the 
  factual inferences needed to give the evidence relevance, only if the Crown 
  could first prove the other factual inference for which the &quot;footwear&quot; 
  evidence was offered.</p>
<p>
  [34] As indicated above, the evidence connecting Wilfredo Portillo to the homicide 
  scene could not assist the jury in determining whether the shoes made the prints 
  found at the scene unless other evidence established that the shoes belonged 
  to Wilfredo Portillo. The only other evidence connecting Wilfredo Portillo to 
  the shoes was the evidence that they were found in the vicinity of Wilfredo 
  Portillo's apartment. That fact alone could not reasonably support the inference 
  that the shoes belonged to Wilfredo Portillo as opposed to the many other people 
  who had equal access to that area. Similarly, the evidence of the prints found 
  at the scene could only assist in identifying Wilfredo Portillo as the owner 
  of the shoes if there was other evidence from which it could be inferred that 
  the prints were made by those shoes. The only other evidence, was the expert's 
  evidence that the treads on the shoes were similar to the partial prints found 
  at the scene. That evidence, standing alone, could not reasonably support the 
  inference that those shoes made those prints. This is particularly so given 
  the expert's frank concession that he could not say how many shoes had the same 
  tread pattern. His evidence amounted to no more than an assertion that the shoes 
  found near Wilfredo Portillo's apartment were among an undetermined number of 
  shoes that could have made the prints at the scene of the homicide. </p>
<p>
  [35] The &quot;footwear&quot; evidence could not, absent assumption of facts 
  not proved, or speculation, support either the inference that the shoes made 
  the prints found at the scene or that the shoes belonged to Wilfredo Portillo. 
  The evidence was not relevant. </p>
<p>
  [36] Having argued that the &quot;footwear&quot; evidence was not only admissible, 
  but was also &quot;powerful&quot; evidence, Mr. Downes does not seek the shelter 
  of the curative proviso. In my view, the proviso cannot overcome the improper 
  admission of the &quot;footwear&quot; evidence. The evidence was offered through 
  an expert witness who gave evidence in a forthright and objective manner. The 
  expert used a variety of demonstrative aids, including charts and photographs 
  to explain his evidence to the jury. Both the source of the evidence, and the 
  manner in which it was presented, may well have given it an aura of cogency 
  which on close analysis it does not deserve.</p>
<p>
  [37] More importantly, in the passage quoted above from Crown counsel's closing 
  argument (para. 26), the jury was invited to engage in the circular reasoning 
  I have described above. While initially attractive, on close analysis, that 
  reasoning goes beyond inference to assumption and speculation. The jury may 
  well have engaged in the very reasoning that Crown counsel invited them to undertake. 
  The curative proviso cannot be applied. </p>
<p>
  [38] The &quot;footwear&quot; evidence was directly admissible against only 
  Wilfredo Portillo. It was, however, the Crown's theory that the appellants had 
  acted together in the homicide. If the jury used the &quot;footwear&quot; evidence 
  to place Wilfredo Portillo in very close proximity to the body of the deceased 
  it would have furthered the Crown's case against Noe Portillo as well. Both 
  appellants are entitled to a new trial based on the erroneous admission of the 
  &quot;footwear&quot; evidence.</p>
<p>
  (ii) The voice identification evidence</p>
<p>
  [39] In examination-in-chief, Mrs. Thrasher identified the voice of Noe Portillo 
  as the person who was arguing with the deceased in the early morning of Saturday, 
  May 2. Mrs. Thrasher had not given this evidence previously. The next day counsel 
  advised the court that he had not appreciated that Mrs. Thrasher had given the 
  voice identification evidence until he read it in the newspaper. While this 
  might seem odd, the trial judge and trial counsel agreed that Mrs. Thrasher's 
  testimony was difficult to hear and understand. The trial judge had her evidence 
  replayed so that he could be determine whether she had identified Noe Portillo's 
  voice. </p>
<p>
  [40] Counsel moved for a mistrial. The trial judge conducted a voir dire to 
  determine the basis upon which Mrs. Thrasher had purported to identify Noe Portillo's 
  voice. It turned out that her opinion was based on one very brief prior conversation 
  with Noe Portillo. The trial judge dismissed the application for a mistrial, 
  but indicated that he saw no foundation for Mrs. Thrasher's voice identification 
  evidence. Crown counsel made it clear that he would not rely on that evidence. 
  The trial judge indicated he would caution the jury against placing reliance 
  on it. At first, counsel for Noe Portillo agreed with this approach, but later 
  he asked the trial judge to specifically tell the jury that the voice identification 
  evidence should be disregarded entirely.</p>
<p>
  [41] In his instructions, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; As I said, there is no foundation given in the evidence of Mrs. Thrasher 
  for her ability to have identified the voice of Noe Portillo if, in fact, her 
  testimony was to that effect. In those circumstances I must direct you, and 
  I do now, that it would be dangerous to an extreme degree to place any appreciable 
  weight or significance whatever on the evidence of Mrs. Thrasher should you 
  recall it to be so that she identified the voice of this accused in the victim's 
  apartment [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [42] I agree with the trial judge that there was no foundation for the opinion 
  evidence advanced by Mrs. Thrasher. For that reason, it was not admissible evidence. 
  The trial judge should have told the jury to disregard that evidence in its 
  entirely. There was a danger, especially in an entirely circumstantial case, 
  that if this evidence was given any weight it could tip the balance in favour 
  of the Crown. As Commissioner Kaufman observed in his Report:<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The &#133; danger is that other evidence which has some weight and is worthy 
  of consideration by a jury (whether or not sufficient to sustain guilt) may 
  elevate this evidence of minimal value to a heightened credibility it should 
  not possess.</p>
<p>
  [43] I need not decide whether the trial judge's failure to take the voice identification 
  evidence away from the jury amounts to reversible error since I am satisfied 
  that the improper admission of the &quot;footwear&quot; evidence requires a 
  new trial. On the new trial, the jury will not hear the voice identification 
  evidence. </p>
<p>
  (iii) The hair comparison evidence</p>
<p>
  [44] On appeal, counsel contend that the evidence that certain hairs were microscopically 
  similar to the hairs of the appellants and deceased should not have been admitted 
  into evidence. No objection is taken to the admissibility of the hair comparisons 
  that were matched by DNA analysis to the appellants. </p>
<p>
  [45] The challenged hair comparison evidence cleared the relevance threshold. 
  When considered in combination with the rest of the evidence, the hairs could 
  support the inference that the appellants were at the scene and that Wilfredo 
  Portillo was in possession of the deceased's property (the pillow cases). Both 
  facts were in turn relevant to the identification of the appellants as participants 
  in the homicide: R. v. Morris, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190. </p>
<p>
  [46] On appeal, counsel does not suggest that the hair comparison evidence was 
  irrelevant, but instead argues that its prejudicial potential exceeded its very 
  limited probative value. They rely on the critique of hair comparison evidence 
  found in the Kaufman Report, supra, at pp. 311-24.</p>
<p>
  [47] I accept that in many cases, hair comparison evidence based only on microscopic 
  similarities has limited probative value and may in some cases be excluded under 
  the well recognized power to exclude prosecution evidence if the potential prejudice 
  flowing from the admission of the evidence exceeds its probative value. The 
  evaluation of probative value and prejudicial effect is, however, contextual. 
  For example in this case, the fact that hairs which were a DNA match to the 
  appellants were found on the deceased could add to the probative value of the 
  evidence that certain other hairs found at the scene were microscopically similar 
  to the appellants' hairs, and at the same time diminish the potential prejudice. 
  In any event, the trial judge was not asked to exclude the evidence. I cannot 
  say that he erred in law in failing, on his own initiative, to exclude this 
  evidence on the basis that its potential prejudicial effect exceeded its probative 
  value. </p>
<p>
  (iv) The jewellery evidence</p>
<p>
  [48] The appellants argue that evidence that Wilfredo Portillo was in possession 
  of costume jewellery similar to costume jewellery in the deceased's possession 
  was irrelevant and should not have been admitted into evidence. Not only was 
  this objection not made at trial, evidence comparing the jewellery found in 
  possession of Wilfredo Portillo and that belonging to the deceased was led at 
  the insistence of the defence. </p>
<p>
  [49] It was the Crown's case that the appellants had stolen from the deceased 
  on the night of the homicide and that theft was at least one of the motives 
  for the homicide. Evidence placing the appellants in possession of property 
  owned by the deceased was relevant. While the evidence that the cheap jewellery 
  in the possession of Wilfredo Portillo was generically similar to the cheap 
  jewellery in the possession of the deceased could not alone support the inference 
  that the jewellery in Wilfredo Portillo's possession belonged to the deceased, 
  there was other evidence placing Wilfredo Portillo in possession of the deceased's 
  property (the red bicycle and pillow cases). In considering whether the costume 
  jewellery belonged to the deceased, a jury could properly consider that Wilfredo 
  Portillo was in possession of other property belonging to the deceased.</p>
<p>
  [50] My analysis satisfies me that the jewellery evidence was relevant. There 
  was no attempt at trial to exclude the evidence on the basis that its potential 
  prejudicial effect outweighed its potential probative value. As with the hair 
  comparison evidence, I cannot say that the trial judge should have excluded 
  the evidence on his own initiative. </p>
<p>
  IV</p>
<p>
  The Reasonableness of the Verdicts</p>
<p>
  [51] The appellants submit that when only the properly admissible evidence is 
  considered, there was no basis upon which a reasonable jury, properly instructed, 
  could convict either of them. They ask this court to enter acquittals. The reasonableness 
  standard as applied to the review of criminal convictions is well established 
  and need not be repeated here: see R. v. Biniaris, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381. The 
  question is not whether a conviction was the only reasonable verdict, but whether 
  it was a reasonable verdict.</p>
<p>
  [52] In considering the reasonableness of the verdicts, I start with the concession 
  made by counsel for the appellants in this court. They acknowledge, quite properly 
  in my view, that the circumstantial evidence could support the inference that 
  the appellants were at the deceased's apartment when the homicide occurred. 
  Counsel also observe, again quite properly in my view, that the same evidence 
  could support the inference that there were more than two people in the apartment 
  with the deceased when the homicide occurred.</p>
<p>
  [53] In addition to the evidence placing the appellants in the apartment when 
  the homicide occurred, there was evidence that the apartment was very small 
  and that the deceased had an argument with someone in that apartment in the 
  early morning hours of May 2. I think a jury could infer that the homicide occurred 
  in the course of that argument. Next, there was evidence that whoever was present 
  in that apartment left in a hurry. Again, I think the jury could infer that 
  the departure occurred immediately after the homicide. Finally, there was evidence 
  that the device used to strangle the deceased had to be assembled thus suggesting 
  that the strangulation was not a spur of the moment act. </p>
<p>
  [54] In addition to the evidence outlined above, there was evidence that Wilfredo 
  Portillo was in possession of the deceased's red bicycle two days after the 
  homicide. On the evidence of the deceased's friend, that bike was taken from 
  the deceased's apartment some time after 11:00 p.m. on Friday night. A jury 
  could reasonably infer that the bicycle was stolen at the time of the homicide 
  and that Wilfredo Portillo stole it. A jury could also infer that theft was 
  a motive for the homicide and that the thief was a party to the killing: Reference 
  re R. v. Coffin (1956), 114 C.C.C. 1 per Taschereau J. at 13-14, per Kellock 
  J. at 31-32 (S.C.C.). The evidence placing Wilfredo Portillo at the scene when 
  the deceased was killed following a quarrel, his quick exit from the apartment, 
  combined with the evidence that Wilfredo Portillo stole the deceased's bicycle 
  at the time of the homicide provided a basis upon which a reasonable jury, properly 
  instructed, could convict Wilfredo Portillo of murder.</p>
<p>
  [55] The evidence connecting Noe Portillo to the theft from the deceased was 
  weaker than was the evidence connecting Wilfredo Portillo to that theft. I am 
  satisfied, however, on the totality of that evidence, that a reasonable jury 
  could conclude that Noe Portillo was involved in the theft. There was evidence 
  from which the jury could conclude that Noe Portillo was with Wilfredo Portillo 
  when both left the deceased's apartment after the homicide with Wilfredo Portillo 
  in possession of the deceased's red bicycle. There was also evidence from which 
  the jury could infer that Noe Portillo was complicit in Wilfredo Portillo's 
  attempts to hide that red bicycle some two days later. Finally, I think a reasonable 
  jury could, in the context of the evidence concerning the red bicycle, conclude 
  that Noe Portillo stole the green bicycle belonging to the deceased that was 
  found in his possession two days after the homicide at the same time that Wilfredo 
  Portillo stole the red bicycle. The evidence provides a basis upon which a reasonable 
  jury, properly instructed, could convict Noe Portillo of murder.</p>
<p>
  V</p>
<p>
  The Charge to the Jury</p>
<p>
  [56] As I would order a new trial for both appellants, I will refer to the submissions 
  concerning the charge to the jury only to the extent that my comments might 
  assist on the new trial. In doing so, I recognize that there is no guarantee 
  that the evidence heard on the new trial will track the evidence heard on the 
  first trial, and that my comments may be of limited help on the retrial.</p>
<p>
  (i) The instruction on recklessness</p>
<p>
  [57] In the course of explaining murder as defined in s. 229(a)(ii), the trial 
  judge defined the concept of recklessness in these terms: </p>
<p class="indent"> In other words, if a person knows that the bodily harm he is 
  inflicting will likely cause death but goes ahead and inflicts it anyway that 
  person is reckless or heedless of the consequences. </p>
<p class="indent">In regard to reckless I have already said to you that you should 
  give it its ordinary meaning, meaning careless as to the consequences or lacking 
  in prudence or caution [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [58] In R. v. Nygaard (1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 417 at 435 (S.C.C.), Cory J. considered 
  the mental element of murder as defined in s. 229(a)(ii).</p>
<p class="indent"> The section requires that the Crown prove that the accused 
  meant to cause the victim such bodily harm that he knew that it was likely to 
  cause the death of the victim and was reckless whether death ensued or not as 
  a result of causing that bodily harm. The essential element is that of intending 
  to cause bodily harm of such a grave and serious nature that the accused knew 
  that it was likely to result in the death of the victim. The aspect of recklessness 
  is almost an afterthought insofar as the basic intent is concerned. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Thus the section required the accused to intend to cause the 
  gravest of bodily harm that is so dangerous and serious that he knows it is 
  likely to result in death and to persist in that conduct despite the knowledge 
  of the risk.</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, the vital element of the requisite intent is that 
  of causing such bodily harm that the perpetrator knows that it is likely to 
  cause death and yet persists in the assault &#133; [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [59] The emphasized part of the trial judge's instructions captures the meaning 
  of recklessness described in Nygaard, supra. While criminal lawyers prickle 
  at the use of words or terms such as &quot;careless&quot; or &quot;lacking in 
  prudence&quot; to describe criminal liability, I think the jury would have taken 
  the meaning to be given to those words from the immediately preceding instruction. 
  It would have been better had the trial judge avoided the use of words like 
  &quot;careless&quot; or &quot;lacking in prudence&quot;, but I am satisfied 
  that his instruction as a whole properly conveyed the meaning of recklessness 
  in s. 229(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>
  (ii) The intoxication instruction</p>
<p>
  [60] The trial judge instructed the jury that they could consider evidence of 
  alcohol consumption by the appellants in determining whether the Crown had proved 
  that the appellants had the requisite criminal intent. There was no evidence 
  as to how much the appellants had had to drink during the evening of May 1 and 
  the early morning of May 2, and there was no evidence as to the effect, if any, 
  that alcohol consumption had had on the appellants. There was evidence that 
  the appellants were part of a group which spent Friday evening and early Saturday 
  morning drinking a great deal of alcohol. I seriously doubt whether intoxication 
  was a live issue at this trial. The relative insignificance of the evidence 
  of intoxication to the appellants' defence is best demonstrated by the fact 
  that neither counsel for Wilfredo nor Noe Portillo made any reference to intoxication 
  in their closing address to the jury. </p>
<p>
  [61] Assuming that there was a basis upon which the jury could properly consider 
  the evidence of alcohol consumption in determining the criminal culpability 
  of the appellants, I do agree that the trial judge should have separately related 
  the evidence of alcohol consumption to the mens rea component of s. 21(2) liability. 
  Where an accused is potentially liable for murder under s. 21(2) and intoxication 
  is a &quot;live&quot; issue, it is particularly important that the intoxication 
  instruction be related to the mental component of s. 21(2). Under that section, 
  an accused is liable for murder only if he knew that another party to the joint 
  venture would commit murder as a probable consequence of carrying out that joint 
  venture. In the present case, one appellant could be liable under s. 21(2) only 
  if he formed an intention in common to steal and knew that it was probable that 
  a party to the common design would commit murder in the course of the theft. 
  Evidence of a level of intoxication which may be of no avail to an appellant 
  whose liability flowed from s. 21(1) could take on a more prominent role in 
  a jury's determination of liability rested on s. 21(2).</p>
<p>
  (iii) The instruction on party liability</p>
<p>
  [62] The appellants make three submissions arising out of the instructions to 
  the jury on s. 21(1) and s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code. First, they submit that 
  the trial judge should not have made any reference to potential liability based 
  on omissions in his instructions on s. 21(1)(b) and that his reference to liability 
  based on omissions could have prejudiced the appellants if the jury concluded 
  that one or both was present when the homicide occurred and did nothing to prevent 
  the homicide. Next, the appellants contend that the evidence did not support 
  the conclusion that more than one person was involved in the homicide and that 
  it was, therefore, improper to instruct the jury on aiding (s. 21(1)(b)) or 
  abetting (s. 21(1)(c)). Finally, the appellants submit that there was no evidence 
  of a common design to either kill or steal from the deceased and that criminal 
  liability flowing from a joint venture either under s. 21(1) or s. 21(2) should 
  not have been left with the jury.</p>
<p>
  [63] If the appellants' second and third submissions are correct, the trial 
  judge should have told the jury that only one of the appellants could be found 
  culpable and if the jury could not determine which of the two was culpable, 
  it must acquit both: R. v. Schell and Paquette (No. 1) (1977), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 
  422 at 428 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Schell and Paquette (No. 2) (1979), 47 C.C.C. 
  (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [64] I agree with the appellants' submission that the trial judge's reference 
  to liability based on omissions was inappropriate and potentially prejudicial. 
  There was no basis upon which either appellant could be found to have aided 
  in the homicide by virtue of a mere failure to act. A failure to act by one 
  present at the scene of the crime will not amount to aiding in the crime absent 
  a duty to act and an intention to aid the perpetrator: R. v. Davey (2000), 137 
  O.A.C. 53 at 59 (C.A.). Although the trial judge did tell the jury that mere 
  presence at the scene does not constitute aiding, it would have been better 
  had he not made any reference to omissions in his instructions on liability 
  under s. 21(1). </p>
<p>
  [65] As to the second and third arguments advanced by the appellants, their 
  reliance on Sparrow, supra, and Schell and Paquette, supra, is misplaced. In 
  Sparrow, supra, the deceased was found shot to death at the side of the road. 
  There was circumstantial evidence connecting the accused, Sparrow, to the shooting. 
  The trial judge instructed the jury that Sparrow could be convicted as an aider 
  or abetter. On appeal, counsel argued that there was no basis upon which Sparrow 
  could be found to be other than the actual perpetrator of the shooting. The 
  Crown argued that the location and manner in which the shooting occurred supported 
  the inference that more than one person must have been involved in the shooting 
  thereby justifying the instruction on aiding and abetting. Martin J.A. rejected 
  this submission stating at p. 457: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Suffice it to say that, having regard to the deceased's intoxicated state, the 
  circumstances relied upon do not support the proposition that the killing required 
  more than one person.</p>
<p>
  [66] The appellants read this passage as meaning that the Crown must prove that 
  a killing &quot;required more than one person&quot; before liability based on 
  aiding or abetting can be put to the jury. This submission is wrong. There are 
  many cases where there is overwhelming evidence of aiding or abetting and yet 
  it could not be said that the &quot;killing required more than one person&quot;. 
  The words of Martin J.A. must be understood as a response to the Crown's submission 
  that the circumstances surrounding the killing demonstrated that it must have 
  been more than a &quot;one man&quot; operation thus justifying an aiding and 
  abetting instruction. Martin J.A. rejected this view of the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [67] The aiding and abetting provisions are properly left as a basis for liability 
  if there is evidence upon which a jury could conclude that an accused was an 
  aider or abetter as defined in the Criminal Code. Martin J.A. made this clear 
  in the passage immediately following the passage relied on by the appellants: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where, on a joint trial, there is evidence that a crime was committed by two 
  or more accused persons acting in concert, it is, of course, appropriate to 
  charge the jury with respect to the provisions of s. 21 of the Code even though 
  it is uncertain which accused was the actual perpetrator [citations omitted]. 
  I am of the view that it is also appropriate, where an accused is being tried 
  alone and there is evidence that more than one person was involved in the commission 
  of the offence, to direct the jury with respect to the provisions of s. 21 of 
  the Charter even though the identity of the other participant or participants 
  is unknown, and even though the precise part played by each participant may 
  be uncertain. It is, in my view, however, improper to charge the jury with respect 
  to the liability of the accused as a party under s. 21 when there is no evidence 
  proper to be left with the jury that more than one person was actually involved 
  in the commission of the offence &#133; [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [68] Schell and Paquette, supra, also has no application. That case stands 
  for the proposition that on a joint trial, if there is no evidence that the 
  accused acted together in the commission of the crime charged or in the furtherance 
  of some other criminal object, the jury should not be instructed on aiding and 
  abetting or potential liability under s. 21(2). The jury must also be told that 
  if it cannot determine which of the accused committed the crime, then both must 
  be acquitted.<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> </p>
<p>
  [69] In this case, there was evidence from which the jury could infer that both 
  appellants were present in the deceased's relatively small apartment during 
  an argument that culminated in his death by a means which required some preparation. 
  The jury could also infer that the appellants fled the apartment together. Finally, 
  the jury could infer that the appellants were party to a theft which occurred 
  in the course of the same transaction as the homicide, and that the theft was 
  a motive for the homicide. On this record, there was a basis upon which to leave 
  liability under s. 21(1)(b), s. 21(1)(c) and s. 21(2). </p>
<p>
  [70] As I understand the evidence, even if the jury was satisfied that the appellants 
  were somehow involved in the death of the deceased, they may well have been 
  unable to determine the exact nature of each appellant's participation in the 
  homicide. Specifically, even if the jury were satisfied that both appellants 
  were involved in the killing, they may have been unable to determine whether 
  one, the other, or both actually participated in the strangling of the deceased. 
  </p>
<p> [71] In these circumstances, I suggest that potential liability under s. 21(1) 
  might be explained along the following lines: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The liability of each accused under s. 21(1) must be determined separately. 
    Each accused may be found not guilty, guilty of murder, or not guilty of murder 
    but guilty of manslaughter. The verdicts with respect to each accused do not 
    have to be the same. </li>
  <li>To convict an accused of murder or manslaughter, the jury must be satisfied 
    that the accused participated in the killing.</li>
  <li>Participation means doing something that caused the death of the deceased 
    or doing something for the purpose of helping another person to do something 
    that caused the death of the deceased. </li>
  <li>If the jury is satisfied that an accused participated in the killing as 
    described above, it is unnecessary for the jury to determine the exact nature 
    of that participation.</li>
  <li>If the jury is satisfied that an accused participated in the killing of 
    the deceased, he is guilty of either murder or manslaughter. He is guilty 
    of murder if he did so with the necessary blameworthy state of mind and manslaughter 
    if the Crown has not proved the blameworthy state of mind.</li>
  <li>The blameworthy state of mind consists of intending that the deceased should 
    be killed; or intending that he should suffer bodily harm of a kind likely 
    to result in death and yet proceeding despite knowledge of that risk: R. v. 
    Kirkness (1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 127 (S.C.C.).</li>
</ul>
<p> [72] The jury would also have to be instructed on potential liability for 
  murder and manslaughter under s. 21(2). Liability for murder under s. 21(2) 
  requires that the Crown prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the accused was a party to a common design to steal from the deceased;</li>
  <li>another person who was a party to that same common design committed murder 
    as defined in s. 229(a) in the course of carrying out the theft; and </li>
  <li>the accused knew that murder was a probable consequence of carrying out 
    the common design to steal from the deceased.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [73] If the Crown proves the first two of the three elements described above, 
  but fails to prove that the accused knew that murder was a probable consequence 
  of carrying out the common design, the accused is not guilty of murder but is 
  guilty of manslaughter if a reasonable person would have foreseen the risk of 
  harm to the deceased as a result of carrying out the common design to steal 
  from him: R. v. Jackson, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 573.</p>
<p>
  VI</p>
<p>
  [74] I would allow the appeals, quash the convictions and order a new trial.
