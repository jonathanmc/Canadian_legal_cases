<p>An application for leave to appeal and if leave is granted, an appeal from 
  the sentence imposed by the Justice Edward F. Ormston, of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice, on April 18, 2002.</p>
<p>DOHERTY J.A.:</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>[1] The respondent pled guilty to one count of mischief to property (s. 430(1)(a) 
  of the Criminal Code) and one count of cruelty to animals (s. 446(1)(a) of the 
  Criminal Code). On April 18, 2002, he was sentenced to 90 days intermittent 
  on the cruelty to animals charge and to a consecutive, conditional 18 month 
  sentence followed by three years probation on the mischief charge. </p>
<p>[2] The Crown seeks leave to appeal and if leave is granted, seeks an order 
  varying the sentences so as to require the respondent to serve an additional 
  10 months in custody.</p>
<p>[3] I would grant leave to appeal the sentences, but would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>[4] The respondent and two others<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> captured a healthy domestic 
  cat belonging to an unknown third party and took it to an abandoned building. 
  They proceeded to torture and finally kill the helpless animal. The respondent 
  videotaped this process. The police, acting on information received from a roommate 
  of the respondent, went to his apartment. They discovered the skinned body of 
  the cat hanging in the refrigerator. The cat&#146;s head was in a zip lock bag 
  in the freezer. The police also located the videotape made of the torturing 
  and killing of the cat. This videotape became the centrepiece of the Crown&#146;s 
  case.</p>
<p>[5] The torturing and killing of the cat took almost six minutes. I will not 
  attempt to describe the wanton cruelty visited upon this poor animal by the 
  respondent and his two associates. Their conduct is nauseous in the literal 
  sense of that word. It is obvious from the videotape that the respondent was 
  in charge. It is equally clear that all three were willing and full participants 
  in the torture of the cat. I see little point in distinguishing among the various 
  acts of cruelty perpetrated by each individual. They were all equally responsible 
  for everything that was done to this animal.</p>
<p>[6] There was considerable debate in the sentencing proceeding as to the respondent&#146;s 
  motivation for this vile act. The trial judge found that the respondent did 
  not set out to catch and torture a cat:</p>
<p class="indent">I believe that this was a misguided venture conceived in furtherance 
  of his artistic desire to challenge the conventions of a meat eating society 
  &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; I do not believe that he [Mr. Power] meant the cat to 
  suffer. I believe that he intended to kill it quickly, but was incompetent. 
  It became cruel and he was reckless in letting it happen.</p>
<p>[7] This court must show deference to the trial judge&#146;s findings of fact. 
  I have no difficulty in accepting his finding as to the respondent&#146;s intention 
  and state of mind prior to the commencement of the torture of the cat. If, however, 
  the trial judge&#146;s findings go so far as to hold that even during the infliction 
  of the torture on the cat, the respondent did not intend that the cat should 
  suffer, I must reject that finding of fact as patently unreasonable. Although 
  the respondent had apparently ingested some drug, there is nothing in the videotape 
  or in his subsequent conduct to suggest that he did not fully appreciate and, 
  indeed, to some extent, relish in the cruelty inflicted upon this cat. It is 
  impossible to interpret his actions as indicative of a desire to bring about 
  a quick end to the cat&#146;s suffering. While it may help those who cannot 
  reconcile this act with the respondent&#146;s character, to rationalize his 
  actions as some form of artistic endeavour or artistic commentary gone amuck, 
  that interpretation is inconsistent with the contents of the videotape. Whatever 
  the respondent&#146;s intentions or motives at the outset, this became torture 
  for torture&#146;s sake.</p>
<p>[8] The trial judge characterized this case as &#147;very high on the continuum 
  of the worst offence&#148;, although not the worst offence. I agree with Crown 
  counsel that the &#147;worst offence&#148; appellation is properly applied to 
  that group of offences which, because of the manner in which they are committed, 
  could attract the maximum penalty depending on the factors particular to the 
  offender: R. v. Olson (1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 355 at para. 49 (Ont. C.A.). The 
  cruelty practised here brings this case within that category of worst offence. 
</p>
<p>[9] The respondent is, however, far from the worst offender. Indeed, the conduct 
  which brought him before the criminal court was completely out of character. 
  He was twenty-one years of age at the time he committed these offences and had 
  no criminal record. The respondent is an intelligent, artistically gifted, principled 
  young man with a strong social conscience that has led him to strongly support 
  various worthwhile causes. He is truly remorseful for his actions and the negative 
  repercussions those actions have had on his family and others. He has felt the 
  wrath of the community in a very direct way, but continues to enjoy the strong 
  support of his immediate family and those in charge of the school he attends. 
</p>
<p>[10] Dr. Klassen, a psychiatrist, provided a detailed psychiatric assessment 
  of the respondent. He was satisfied that the respondent did not suffer from 
  a mental disorder and that he did not present a risk to the community. Dr. Klassen 
  observed:</p>
<p class="indent">My clinical impression, based on my time spent with Mr. Power, 
  the results of psychometric testing, and a review of collateral information, 
  is that this individual offended out of some combination of adolescent self-importance, 
  an ultimately egocentric morality (insofar as while the pretext for his actions 
  has typically been to challenge and inform society. His lack of awareness of 
  the nature of the response that his actions might garner suggests that he ultimately 
  was relatively egocentric in his thinking), association with particular peers 
  and, perhaps to an extent, the need to challenge conventions of morality that 
  is seen as an imperative in some artistic circles.</p>
<p>[11] In summary, the trial judge was faced with the difficult task of crafting 
  a fit sentence for a young first offender who, but for this terrible act, is 
  a good person with considerable potential.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>[12] The trial judge&#146;s reasons for sentence are thorough and thoughtful. 
  He observed that the offence of cruelty to animals was a summary conviction 
  offence with a maximum penalty of six months. The offence of mischief to property 
  where, as in this case, the Crown proceeded by indictment, was subject to a 
  maximum penalty of two years. The trial judge concluded, quite properly, that 
  despite the positive features of the respondent&#146;s character and background, 
  principles of deterrence and denunciation required a period of incarceration 
  on the cruelty to animals charge. He imposed a sentence of 90 days intermittent 
  having regard to the seven days the respondent had spent in the Don Jail prior 
  to his release on bail. In effect, the trial judge imposed a three and a half 
  month sentence on the cruelty to animals charge.</p>
<p>[13] The trial judge also concluded that a consecutive sentence on the mischief 
  charge was appropriate. He imposed an 18 month conditional sentence to be followed 
  by three years probation. The trial judge attached stringent terms to the conditional 
  sentence, including virtual house arrest for the first nine months and an order 
  requiring that the respondent perform 240 hours of community service. The respondent 
  is subject to some form of supervision for five years by virtue of the sentences 
  imposed on him. </p>
<p>[14] The respondent has completed his intermittent sentence, the most stringent 
  portion of the conditional sentence, and has performed well over half of the 
  community service he is required to perform under the conditional sentence. 
  He has complied with all court orders.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>[15] In submitting that the sentence should be varied to require an additional 
  ten months incarceration, the Crown accepts that the two offences properly attracted 
  consecutive sentences and that both offences warrant incarceration. I cannot 
  accept either premise. The real harm to which this sentence had to be directed 
  was the cruelty done to the cat. While the mischief charge was made out given 
  that the cat belonged to someone else, that charge added little to the wrong 
  for which the respondent had to be punished. That wrong, the cruelty to the 
  cat, is punishable by a maximum of six months in jail. That maximum cannot be 
  artificially increased by adding a second charge which arises from exactly the 
  same conduct and addresses an interest which is only tenuously engaged in the 
  circumstances. I repeat, the conduct for which the respondent primarily had 
  to be punished was the cruelty done to the cat and not the interference with 
  some unknown person&#146;s property rights in the cat. </p>
<p>[16] In sentencing the respondent, the trial judge was required to focus on 
  the cruelty done to the cat as this was the conduct for which the respondent 
  most deserved punishment. In fixing the appropriate penalty, the trial judge 
  had to bear in mind that six months was the maximum penalty provided for that 
  offence. It may well be that the present maximum is wholly inadequate. That 
  is, however, a matter for Parliament.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> Considering the maximum 
  penalty available and the total effect of the sentences imposed by the trial 
  judge, it cannot be said that those sentences do not adequately reflect the 
  seriousness of the respondent&#146;s conduct and the harm done by that conduct.</p>
<p>[17] I would grant leave to appeal, but would dismiss the appeal by the Crown.</p>
