<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] This appeal was restored to the list. There are three grounds of appeal 
  raised with respect to the appellant's conviction for robbery. The first ground 
  of appeal relates to the issue of whether the trial judge's charge to the jury 
  was adequate on the issue of reasonable doubt. Although the charge did not comply 
  with the suggested charge in R. v. Lifchus (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), 
  we are of the opinion that the jury could not have misunderstood their duty. 
  Given the nature of the defence, alibi, the instruction on reasonable doubt 
  given by the trial judge, the R. v. W(D) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.) 
  instruction with respect to the defence of alibi and defence counsel's address 
  to the jury, we are satisfied that the jury would not have misunderstood the 
  standard of proof. This ground of appeal is dismissed.</p>    <P>
  [2] There is no merit to the second ground of appeal. Namely, that the trial 
  judge improperly curtailed cross examination. The trial judge did not limit 
  defence counsel's right to make full answer and defence. </p>    <P>
  [3] The third ground of appeal was not pursued for the very good reason that 
  any initial misimpression in the charge was cured by the charge on alibi. </p>    
<P> [4] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
