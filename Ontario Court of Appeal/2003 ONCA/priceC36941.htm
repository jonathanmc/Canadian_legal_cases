<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice James M. Farley of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated August 9, 2001. </p>
<p>GOUDGE J.A.</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal from the judgment of Farley J. by the appellants, Olympia 
  &amp; York Realty Corp. (OYRC) and its wholly owned subsidiary Olympia &amp; 
  York SF Holdings Corp. (OYSF). The respondent, who succeeded at trial, is Price 
  Waterhouse Coopers Inc. as the trustee in bankruptcy of Olympia &amp; York Developments 
  Ltd. (OYDL).</p>
<p>[2] The judgment concluded a trial which scrutinized a transaction done on 
  March 16, 1992 between OYDL and the appellants. The trial judge concluded that, 
  pursuant to s.100 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 
  (BIA), this was a reviewable transaction in which there was a conspicuous difference 
  between the fair market value of what OYDL received and what it gave up. The 
  trial judge also found that pursuant to s. 248 of the Ontario Business Corporations 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16 (OBCA), the transaction constituted oppression of 
  the creditors of OYDL. He determined that the appropriate remedy was the same 
  for each claim, namely to give the trustee in bankruptcy of OYDL the appellants&#8217; 
  remaining assets to make up for the loss. </p>
<p>[3] The appellants argue that the trial judge erred in a number of respects 
  in applying both s. 100 of the BIA and s. 248 of the OBCA. For the reasons that 
  follow, I conclude that he did not err, except in one minor respect which does 
  not affect the outcome. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>THE FACTS</p>
<p>[4] In 1992, OYDL owned 100 percent of the shares of OYRC which, in turn, owned 
  100 percent of the shares of OYSF. OYRC held a significant number of US real 
  estate investments and, through OYSF, shares in certain US public companies.</p>
<p>[5] At the date of the transaction in question in this litigation, March 16, 
  1992, OYSF owed OYDL approximately $391 million, secured by a promissory note 
  that it had given to OYDL (the OYSF note). </p>
<p>[6] In addition, OYSF had pledged a large proportion of its shareholdings to 
  guarantee various financial obligations of OYDL and its other subsidiaries. 
  Of these, a significant number of its marketable securities were pledged to 
  guarantee a major loan made by the European Investment Bank (EIB) under an agreement 
  that constituted these securities a security interest in favour of EIB only 
  on the occurrence of a &#8220;triggering event&#8221;. If no triggering event 
  occurred, these securities were free of any EIB charge and would be available 
  to OYDL to recover under the OYSF note.</p>
<p>[7] As of March 16, 1992, Hong Kong Bank Canada (HKBC) had extended a US $25 
  million credit facility to OYDL secured in part by a guarantee from OYSF. Pursuant 
  to s. 20 of the OBCA, HKBC asked for a certificate by OYSF that it was solvent 
  as defined in that section of the Act. However, no solvency certificate was 
  required by s. 20(2)(c) of the OBCA, since OYSF was indirectly a wholly owned 
  subsidiary of OYDL. HKBC had requested the solvency certificate as part of its 
  standard checklist. When this had happened in the past, HKBC had typically been 
  advised by a borrower or counsel if an exemption applied. Neither OYDL nor its 
  counsel had raised the issue of the exemption with HKBC. </p>
<p>[8] The impugned transaction of March 16, 1992 involved several steps. OYDL 
  acquired additional OYRC shares from OYRC for a stated consideration of $397.8 
  million. OYRC acquired additional OYSF shares from OYSF for a stated consideration 
  in the same amount. OYSF directed that $390.8 million be repaid to OYDL for 
  the OYSF note and that $7 million be advanced to OYDL to be evidenced by a note 
  from OYDL to OYSF. No money actually changed hands. The end result for OYDL 
  was that it acquired additional shares in OYRC and surrendered the OYSF note. 
</p>
<p>[9] On May 22, 1992, petitions for a receiving order under the BIA were issued 
  against OYDL and a number of its subsidiaries including OYRC and OYSF. After 
  the bankruptcy petition with respect to OYDL was heard on December 20, 1994, 
  a receiving order was issued and the respondent was appointed trustee in bankruptcy 
  of OYDL. OYRC and OYSF have not been adjudged bankrupt.</p>
<p>[10] After OYDL was adjudged bankrupt, all of OYSF&#8217;s marketable securities 
  were sold and secured creditors were paid the proceeds from the securities which 
  had been pledged. Thereafter, there was approximately US $30 million left over, 
  representing the remaining proceeds of realization on OYSF&#8217;s assets. These 
  funds have been held in trust to await the outcome of this litigation. </p>
<p>[11] In this action, the respondent trustee in bankruptcy for OYDL claimed 
  that under s. 100 of the BIA, the fair market value of the OYSF note was conspicuously 
  greater than the fair market value of the additional OYRC shares which OYDL 
  received in the transaction. It also claimed under s. 248 of the OBCA that the 
  transaction unfairly disregarded the interests of the creditors of OYDL and 
  thus constituted an act of oppression.</p>
<p>[12] The trial judge held that the fair market value of the OYSF note was between 
  US $30 and $50 million. He further held that the fair market value of the additional 
  OYRC shares was nil and that there was therefore a conspicuous difference of 
  US $30 to $50 million for purposes of s. 100 of the BIA. He found that the appellants 
  had not satisfied him that he should exercise his residual discretion under 
  s. 100(2) of the BIA to refuse judgment for that conspicuous difference.</p>
<p>[13] Turning to s. 248 of the OBCA the trial judge held that, in the circumstances, 
  the respondent was a proper complainant and that the transaction constituted 
  an oppression of the creditors of OYDL. </p>
<p>[14] By way of remedy, the trial judge ordered that the respondent was entitled 
  to the funds held in trust on either basis: pursuant to s. 100 of the BIA or 
  pursuant to s. 248 of the OBCA. He reasoned that even the low end of the range 
  of conspicuous difference which he had found, when coupled with prejudgment 
  interest and then converted to US dollars, was equivalent to the value of the 
  funds held in trust to the credit of this action. Hence this sum was required 
  to compensate the respondent for its loss due to the transaction. Before us, 
  the appellants take no issue with this remedy if the trial judge is found to 
  have properly applied these two sections.</p>
<p>ANALYSIS</p>
<p>[15] The appellants raise challenges to a number of the trial judge&#8217;s 
  conclusions in both his analysis under s. 100 of the BIA and his analysis under 
  s. 248 of the OBCA. So far as these challenges are to findings of fact, the 
  trial judge&#8217;s conclusions are entitled to significant deference in this 
  court. We can interfere only if the trial judge has made a palpable and overriding 
  error. In Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 Iacobucci and Major JJ. 
  said this at para. 1:</p>
<p class="indent">A proposition that should be unnecessary to state is that a 
  court of appeal should not interfere with a trial judge&#8217;s reasons unless 
  there is a palpable and overriding error. The same proposition is sometimes 
  stated as prohibiting an appellate court from reviewing a trial judge&#8217;s 
  decision if there was some evidence upon which he or she could have relied to 
  reach that conclusion.</p>
<p>[16] With this in mind I will first address the appellants&#8217; arguments 
  in relation to s. 100 of the BIA and then those in relation to s. 248 of the 
  OBCA.</p>
<p>THE S. 100 ISSUE</p>
<p>[17] Section 100(1) and (2) of the BIA read as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">100(1) Where a bankrupt sold, purchased, leased, hired, supplied 
  or received property or services in a reviewable transaction within the period 
  beginning on the day that is one year before the date of the initial bankruptcy 
  event and ending on the date of the bankruptcy, both dates included, the court 
  may, on the application of the trustee, inquire into whether the bankrupt gave 
  or received, as the case may be, fair market value in consideration for the 
  property or services concerned in the transaction.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where the court in proceedings under this section finds 
  that the consideration given or received by the bankrupt in the reviewable transaction 
  was conspicuously greater or less than the fair market value of the property 
  or services concerned in the transaction, the court may give judgment to the 
  trustee against the other party to the transaction, against any other person 
  being privy to the transaction with the bankrupt or against all those persons 
  for the difference between the actual consideration given or received by the 
  bankrupt and the fair market value, as determined by the court, of the property 
  or services concerned in the transaction.</p>
<p>[18] In making an inquiry under this section, the court must find that there 
  is a reviewable transaction and that it was made within the required time frame. 
  Then the court must determine the fair market value of what the bankrupt gave 
  up and the fair market value of what it received in the transaction. If the 
  former is conspicuously greater than the latter, the section confers a discretion 
  on the court to give judgment against the party to that transaction for the 
  amount of the difference.</p>
<p>[19] While the appellants accept that the time frame requirement is met here, 
  and do not contest the amount of the judgment, they challenge every other step 
  in the trial judge&#8217;s analysis under s. 100 of the BIA. </p>
<p>[20] First, although their oral argument was muted on this point, the appellants 
  contend that there was no &#8220;reviewable transaction&#8221; here but rather 
  a series of separate transactions involving different parties. </p>
<p>[21] This argument can be disposed of quickly. Pursuant to s. 100(1), the court 
  may inquire into whether the bankrupt gave or received fair market value in 
  consideration for the property involved in the transaction. Here the consideration 
  given by OYDL was the OYSF note and the consideration received was the additional 
  shares in OYRC. That is the transaction in issue regardless of the steps taken 
  to achieve this exchange of debt for equity. The purpose of s. 100 cannot be 
  averted simply by using a subsidiary corporation to act as an intermediary. 
  This was a reviewable transaction.</p>
<p>[22] Second, the appellants attack the trial judge&#8217;s finding that the 
  OYSF note which OYDL gave up in the transaction had a fair market value of $30 
  to $50 million. He held that the note would be worth that much to a vulture 
  fund assessing the possible reward against the risk that an undiscovered triggering 
  event could have occurred so as to render the assets of OYSF subject to the 
  security charge in favour of EIB and therefore unavailable to satisfy the note.</p>
<p>[23] Contrary to the appellant&#8217;s submission, the trial judge did not 
  assume an imprudent purchaser in reaching this conclusion. Rather, he accepted 
  the respondent&#8217;s expert evidence that, given the way vulture funds operate, 
  a vulture fund acting prudently would be satisfied with the limited due diligence 
  available to it to assess the possible occurrence of a triggering event and 
  would deal with this uncertainty by discounting its offer price accordingly. 
  This expert evidence proceeded not on the assumption that no triggering event 
  had occurred but, rather, on the basis that there was uncertainty on this score 
  which would cause a vulture fund purchaser to offer a discounted price. It was 
  entirely open to the trial judge to accept this evidence in determining the 
  fair market value of the OYSF note.</p>
<p>[24] Nor are the appellants correct to argue that the trial judge also assumed 
  an imprudent vendor in arriving at his conclusion about the fair market value 
  of the OYSF note. The imprudence advanced by the appellants is that OYDL as 
  the vendor of the OYSF note would have to know that in order to realize value 
  from the note any purchaser would immediately put OYSF and thus OYDL itself 
  into bankruptcy to preempt a subsequent triggering event in favour of EIB. While 
  this was so, and the trial judge clearly understood it, the error in this submission 
  is that it seeks to inject into the analysis factors subjective to the circumstances 
  of OYDL as vendor and not intrinsic to the value of the OYSF note. The calculation 
  of fair market value does not permit this but rather must assume an unconstrained 
  vendor. </p>
<p>[25] The appellants further argue that the trial judge erred in determining 
  the fair market value of the OYSF note by reference to a transaction which was 
  entirely speculative because it was never considered by OYDL nor would it have 
  been since it would have resulted in OYDL&#8217;s own bankruptcy. I disagree. 
  The transaction hypothesized by the trial judge was one between a notional, 
  willing, prudent and informed vendor and purchaser based on factors relevant 
  to the OYSF note itself rather than the particular circumstances of OYDL as 
  the seller of the note. This is an entirely appropriate way to determine the 
  fair market value of the OYSF note.</p>
<p>[26] Finally, the trial judge did not err in not discounting the fair market 
  value of the OYSF note for any alleged equitable set off OYSF would have against 
  OYDL or any purchaser of the note. Such a claim could arise only once the OYSF 
  equities pledged to guarantee OYDL debts had been sold by OYDC creditors and 
  at the date of the transaction no such claim existed. OYSF would thus have had 
  no set off claim when the purchaser of the OYSF note put it into bankruptcy 
  immediately upon making the purchase.</p>
<p>[27] The appellants&#8217; third attack on the trial judge&#8217;s s. 100 analysis 
  focuses on his finding that the additional OYRC shares received by OYDL in the 
  transaction had no value. The trial judge based this conclusion in part on his 
  finding that at the date of the transaction the US real estate assets underlying 
  OYRC (and therefore OYRC itself) had a negative value because their debt load 
  exceeded their market value. In making this finding the trial judge relied primarily 
  on the opinion to that effect of Citibank, OYRC&#8217;s principal banker. The 
  Citibank evidence was given by one of its executives who in turn relied on reports 
  by Citibank experts concerning US real estate values. These experts were not 
  themselves called at trial and the appellants objected to admitting their reports 
  for their truth, although the appellants did not challenge the admissibility 
  of Citibank&#8217;s own opinion as distinct from the reports of its experts.</p>
<p>[28] The trial judge found that he could rely on Citibank&#8217;s own opinion 
  as a foundation for his conclusion that at March 16, 1992 the OYRC real estate 
  interests (and hence OYRC itself) had a negative value and therefore shares 
  in OYRC were worth nothing. The trial judge concluded that he could do so both 
  because Citibank was a significant creditor who could therefore be considered 
  a privy of OYRC and because of Citibank&#8217;s experience in the US real estate 
  market.</p>
<p>[29] In my view, his first reason is erroneous. There was no privity between 
  Citibank and the appellants that would warrant treating the reports of the Citibank 
  experts as admissions of the appellants and therefore admissible for the truth 
  of their contents. Citibank and the appellants shared no privity of title. Nor 
  was it enough that Citibank was a significant creditor of the appellants. Indeed, 
  I think that the divergent interests of creditor and debtor make it unwarranted 
  to take the statements of one about the value of the security underlying the 
  debts as admissions by the other, based on privity. There was simply not a sufficient 
  identity of interest to permit the admissibility of the reports of the Citibank 
  experts as the admissions of the appellants. See J. Sopinka, S.N. Lederman and 
  A.W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2nd ed. Toronto: (Butterworths), 
  1999 at p. 302.</p>
<p>[30] In the end I do not think this matters, because I see no error in the 
  other reason offered by the trial judge for accepting the opinion of Citibank 
  as a basis for finding that as of March 16, 1992 the OYRC real estate interests 
  had a negative value and therefore so did OYRC. The opinion of Citibank itself 
  as to the value of the OYRC real estate was not that of an expert qualified 
  by the court to give an opinion on the value of US real estate. However, it 
  was the opinion of a major lender whose commercial success depended in part 
  upon its deep interest in and experience in the US real estate market. As such 
  its opinion was no doubt admissible. Indeed the appellants did not dispute that 
  at trial, quarrelling only with the admission of the reports of Citibank&#8217;s 
  own experts. The weight to be given to the Citibank opinion was a matter for 
  the trial judge and I see no palpable and overriding error in his use of that 
  evidence as one basis to come to his factual conclusion about the worth of OYRC 
  at the date of the transaction. </p>
<p>[31] Moreover, the trial judge had before him significant additional expert 
  evidence that the fair market value of OYRC as a whole was negative both before 
  and after the transaction. In particular, there were two appraisers&#8217; reports 
  admitted on consent concerning the value of OYRC&#8217;s US real estate and 
  the respondent&#8217;s expert evidence concerning OYRC&#8217;s non-real estate 
  assets. There was thus an ample basis for the trial judge to conclude that at 
  the relevant time the value of OYRC was negative and the fair market value of 
  shares in OYRC including the additional shares received by OYDL in the transaction 
  was nil. </p>
<p>[32] The trial judge also rejected the appellants&#8217; expert evidence that 
  the potential for a rebound in the value of the assets of OYRC gave the shares 
  in OYRC some value. He did so on the basis that there was no evidence that this 
  turnaround was a reasonable expectation. This was a conclusion he was perfectly 
  entitled to draw, given the record before him.</p>
<p>[33] In short there was no palpable error in the trial judge&#8217;s finding 
  that since the assets underlying OYRC had negative value at the relevant times, 
  OYRC&#8217;s shares including the additional shares received by OYDC were worthless. 
</p>
<p>[34] Nor did the trial judge err when he confirmed this conclusion by saying 
  that the transaction of March 16, 1992 added no value to OYRC and that the original 
  100 percent of the shares in OYRC were worth exactly the same as those shares 
  taken together with the additional shares received by OYDL in the transaction, 
  namely nil. The trial judge made clear that this represented both the value 
  of the additional OYRC shares to OYDL and their fair market value given that 
  OYRC then had a negative value. </p>
<p>[35] To summarize, save for the one narrow finding I have referred to I can 
  find no reversible error in the trial judge&#8217;s determination that the fair 
  market value of the OYSF note given up by OYDL was between $30 to $50 million 
  and the fair market value of the additional OYRC shares it received was nil. 
  As I have explained, in neither case did the trial judge depart from a proper 
  fair market value analysis to value the note or the additional shares simply 
  to OYDL. And by any measure the disparity between $30 to $50 million and nil 
  is a conspicuous difference for the purposes of s. 100 of the BIA. </p>
<p>[36] The trial judge&#8217;s final step was to examine the equities in the 
  exercise of the residual discretion given to him under s. 100(2) of the BIA. 
  Here too the appellants say he erred. </p>
<p>[37] In my view, this argument must also fail. There is limited scope for appellate 
  intervention in the exercise of this sort of discretion at first instance. There 
  was no error in principle in the exercise undertaken here. The trial judge was 
  clearly alive to the considerations relevant to the exercise of his discretion. 
  He drew on the factors outlined by this court in Standard Trustco Ltd. (Trustee 
  of) v. Standard Trust Co. (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 1. He made clear the obligation 
  on the appellants to establish the equities which they say disentitle the respondent 
  to relief. He found that it was not enough for the appellants to point to the 
  broad provision of security that OYSF had historically given to OYDL since that 
  was in place prior to and independent of the transaction. Nor was he persuaded 
  by the appellants&#8217; assertion that the transaction had to be undertaken 
  to provide HKBC with a solvency certificate of OYSF. The trial judge concluded 
  that a solvency certificate not required by statute was not an equitable basis 
  to decline to order a s. 100 remedy. He found that the fair value to OYDL of 
  the additional shares in OYRC was nil (as was their fair market value) because 
  OYDL already owned 100 percent of OYRC. Beyond these factors the trial judge 
  found that the appellants had merely made vague allegations but had not proven 
  any facts so as to warrant equitable relief. I cannot say that anything in this 
  analysis constitutes reversible error. </p>
<p>[38] I therefore conclude that the appellants&#8217; various challenges to 
  the trial judge&#8217;s s. 100 conclusion must all fail.</p>
<p>THE S. 248 ISSUES</p>
<p>[39] The trial judge concluded that the circumstances here made this a proper 
  case to allow the respondent trustee in bankruptcy to be a complainant and seek 
  an oppression remedy pursuant to s. 248 of the OBCA. He went on to find that 
  the transaction was oppressive in that it unfairly disregarded the interests 
  of the creditors of OYDL and concluded that this served as a second basis for 
  the remedy that was appropriate under s. 100 of the BIA.</p>
<p>[40] In this court the appellants attack both the finding that the respondent 
  was a proper complainant and the finding that the transaction was oppressive.</p>
<p>[41] Section 245 of the OBCA sets out the definition of &#8220;complainant&#8221; 
  for the purposes of seeking an oppression remedy under s. 248. The trial judge 
  acted here pursuant to s. 245(c) which gives the court a discretion to determine 
  who is a proper person to be a complainant. The definition of &#8220;complainant&#8221; 
  in s. 245 reads as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> 245. In the Part &#8230;</p>
<p class="indent">&#8220;complainant&#8221; means,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) a registered holder or beneficial owner, and a former registered 
  holder or beneficial owner, of a security of a corporation or any of its affiliates,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) a director or an officer or a former director or officer 
  of a corporation or of any of its affiliates,</p>
<p class="indent">(c) any other person who, in the discretion of the court, is 
  a proper person to make an application under this Part.</p>
<p>[42] Section 248(2) is also a discretionary provision. Indeed it gives the 
  court a double discretion. The court must first satisfy itself that the act 
  in question constitutes oppression and having exercised its discretion to come 
  to that conclusion the court may order a remedy. Section 248(1) and (2) read 
  as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">248. (1) A complainant and, in the case of an offering corporation, 
  the Commission may apply to the court for an order under this section.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where, upon an application under subsection (1), the court 
  is satisfied that in respect of a corporation or any of its affiliates,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) any act or omission of the corporation or any of its affiliates 
  effects or threatens to effect a result;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the business or affairs of the corporation or any of its 
  affiliates are, have been or are threatened to be carried on or conducted in 
  a manner; or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the powers of the directors of the corporation or any of 
  its affiliates are, have been or are threatened to be exercised in a manner,</p>
<p class="indent">that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to or that unfairly 
  disregards the interests of any security holder, creditor, director or officer 
  of the corporation, the court may make an order to rectify the matters complained 
  of.</p>
<p>[43] Both of the findings which the appellants challenge constitute exercises 
  of discretion and are therefore entitled to deference in this court. Unless 
  the trial judge erred in principle or made a significant error in determining 
  and weighing the considerations relevant to these findings they are beyond the 
  scope of appellate review.</p>
<p>[44] In challenging the determination that the respondent can be a complainant 
  the appellants argue that the trial judge erred in principle because that status 
  can never be conferred on a trustee in bankruptcy where the bankrupt was a party 
  to the transaction which is said to be oppressive. The appellants say that the 
  decision of Houlden J.A. sitting as a General Division judge in Canada (Attorney 
  General) v. Standard Trust Co. (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 660 stands for this proposition.</p>
<p>[45] It may be that the finding in that case is simply that in the circumstances 
  there the trustee in bankruptcy would not be given a remedy under s. 248 and 
  therefore ought not to be accorded standing as a complainant. If, however, that 
  case sets out the absolute prohibition contended for by the appellants, as I 
  tend to think it does, then despite the great respect due its author I would 
  disagree. The simple reason is that s. 245(c) confers on the court an unfettered 
  discretion to determine whether an applicant is a proper person to commence 
  oppression proceedings under s. 248. This provision is designed to provide the 
  court with flexibility in determining who should be a complainant in any particular 
  case that accompanies the court&#8217;s flexibility in determining if there 
  has been oppression and in fashioning an appropriate remedy. The overall flexibility 
  provided is essential for the broad remedial purpose of these oppression provisions 
  to be achieved. Given the clear language of s. 245(c) and its purpose, I think 
  that where the bankrupt is a party to the allegedly oppressive transaction, 
  the trustee is neither automatically barred from being a complainant nor automatically 
  entitled to that status. It is for the judge at first instance to determine 
  in the exercise of his or her discretion whether in the circumstances of the 
  particular case, the trustee is a proper person to be a complainant.</p>
<p>[46] In this case the appellants were affiliates of OYDL, the party with which 
  the allegedly oppressive transaction was concluded. In that transaction, OYDL 
  gave up something of significant value (the OYSF note) in return for something 
  of no value (additional shares in OYRC). It would have been reasonable for the 
  trial judge to conclude that since the appellants unfairly disregarded the interests 
  of the OYDL creditors, those creditors have properly been recognized as complainants. 
  Thus it was equally reasonable in the circumstances for the trial judge to find 
  that this was a proper case in which to conclude that the trustee of OYDL was 
  a proper person to be a complainant in effect on behalf of the creditors of 
  OYDL. This conclusion is consistent with the bankruptcy principle of collective 
  action to pursue the claims of the creditors of the bankrupt and the trustee&#8217;s 
  role as their representative. See Husky Oil Operations Ltd. v. Canada (Minister 
  of National Revenue), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 453. The appellants have put forward no 
  reason why this principle should not be followed in this case. The trial judge 
  therefore exercised his discretion reasonably in finding that the respondent 
  was a proper person to be a complainant here and I would dismiss the appellants&#8217; 
  first argument. </p>
<p>[47] The appellants&#8217; second argument is that the trial judge ought not 
  to have found the transaction to be oppressive. In essence the appellants say 
  that this was an ordinary course transaction reflective of normal business decisions. 
  The trial judge however found that the exchange of a note of substantial value 
  for shares worth nothing inappropriately deprived the OYDL creditors of a very 
  significant value to which they would otherwise have been entitled. He found 
  that by participating in this transaction the appellants had unfairly disregarded 
  the interests of those creditors. He was satisfied that in this way the transaction 
  effected an oppressive result. In my view, it was entirely reasonable for the 
  trial judge to focus on these aspects of the transaction in coming to his conclusion. 
  He properly exercised his discretion and this court should not interfere. Therefore 
  the appellants&#8217; second argument also fails.</p>
<p>[48] In summary, the appeal must be dismissed. The respondent acknowledges 
  that a costs order against the appellants would be of academic interest only 
  in these circumstances. There is no point in making such an order here. Therefore 
  there will be no costs of the appeal.</p>
