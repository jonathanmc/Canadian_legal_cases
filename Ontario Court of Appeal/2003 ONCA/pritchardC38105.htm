<p>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Justices James M. Farley, 
  Albert J. Roy and Mary A. Sanderson) dated January 10, 2002 and reported at 
  [2002] O.J. No. 1169.</p>
<p>ARMSTRONG J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The issue raised in this appeal is whether a legal opinion prepared for 
  the Ontario Human Rights Commission (the &quot;Commission&quot;) by its in-house 
  counsel is protected by solicitor-client privilege. <br>
</p>
<p>[2] The opinion was one of a number of documents that the Commission had before 
  it when pursuant to s. 34(1)(b) of the Human Rights Code R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19 
  (the &quot;Code&quot;) it decided not to deal with the complaint of the respondent, 
  Colleen Pritchard. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] On a motion before MacFarland J., sitting as a motions judge in the Divisional 
  Court, she determined that the opinion was not protected by solicitor-client 
  privilege and in so doing relied upon a judgment of the New Brunswick Court 
  of Appeal in Melanson v. New Brunswick (Workers' Compensation Board) (1994), 
  146 N.B.R. (2d) 294 (C.A.); leave to appeal denied by the Supreme Court of Canada 
  [1994] S.C.C.A. No. 26. <br>
</p>
<p>[4] The decision of the motions judge, reported at (2001), 148 O.A. C. 260 
  (Div. Ct.), was upheld by a three-judge panel of the Divisional Court.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] In my view, the motions judge and the three-judge panel erred in holding 
  that the legal opinion was not cloaked with solicitor-client privilege. I would 
  therefore allow the appeal for the reasons which follow.<br>
</p>
<p>THE FACTS<br>
</p>
<p>[6] It would be an understatement to say that the proceedings that give rise 
  to the issue before the Court have had a tortured history. Fortunately, it is 
  not necessary for the determination of this appeal to review the proceedings 
  in their entirety. The following is what I consider to be the essential factual 
  context.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] Ms. Pritchard was terminated from her employment with Sears Canada Inc. 
  (&quot;Sears&quot;), in July 1996. In January 1997, Ms. Pritchard filed a human 
  rights complaint which alleged that she had been subjected to gender discrimination 
  and sexual harassment during her employment with Sears. She also alleged that 
  she had been subjected to reprisal for exercising her rights under the Code. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[8] On January 20, 1998, the Commission decided, pursuant to s. 34(1)(b) of 
  the Code, not to deal with most of Ms. Pritchard's complaint. Section 34(1)(b) 
  of the Code provides that the Commission may, in its discretion, decide not 
  to deal with a complaint, where it appears to the Commission that, &quot;the 
  subject-matter of the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in 
  bad faith.&quot; The Commission was of the view that Ms. Pritchard had acted 
  in bad faith because she had signed a release which expressly released claims 
  under the Code. An application for reconsideration pursuant to s. 37 of the 
  Code was dismissed by the Commission. <br>
</p>
<p>[9] Ms. Pritchard commenced an application for judicial review of the Commission's 
  refusal to deal with most of her complaint. The Commission did not defend the 
  application for judicial review and, in fact, consented to the order sought 
  by Ms. Pritchard although the order was opposed by Sears. The Divisional Court 
  quashed the decisions of the Commission and remitted the matter back to the 
  Commission for redetermination under s. 34 of the Code. Sears sought leave to 
  appeal to this Court which was dismissed. <br>
</p>
<p>[10] The complaint was again considered by the Commission pursuant to s. 34, 
  and in what appears to have been a reversal of the position it had taken before 
  the Divisional Court, the Commission again exercised its discretion under s. 
  34(1)(b) of the Code not to deal with most of Ms. Pritchard's complaint. The 
  motions judge commented that if one compared the earlier decision of the Commission 
  with its later decision, they are strikingly similar.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] Ms. Pritchard brought a second application for judicial review before 
  the Divisional Court to strike the Commission's latest decision not to proceed 
  with the complaint. In the course of that application, counsel for Ms. Pritchard 
  wrote to counsel for the Commission and requested production of various documents 
  including a &quot;Legal Opinion that was provided to the Commissioners&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] Counsel for the Commission refused the request for documents including 
  the request for production of the legal opinion. <br>
</p>
<p>[13] Counsel for Ms. Pritchard brought this motion in the Divisional Court 
  requesting &quot;all information - both oral and written - which was placed 
  before the Commission for its consideration of her complaint which resulted 
  in the Commission's decision under s. 34(1)(b) of the Code&quot;. The motions 
  judge ordered the Commission to provide all such information including the legal 
  opinion.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] Counsel for the Commission requested a three-judge panel of the Divisional 
  Court to review the motions judge's decision, limited to the issue of the production 
  of the legal opinion. In a brief endorsement, the three-judge panel confirmed 
  the order of the motions judge.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] This matter now comes before us pursuant to an order of O'Connor A.C.J.O., 
  Goudge and MacPherson JJ.A. granting leave to appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>THE DECISION OF THE MOTIONS JUDGE<br>
</p>
<p>[16] The issues that were before the motions judge were much broader than the 
  single issue that is presently before us. The motions judge had to deal with 
  a fairly broad-based motion for production. Much of her carefully constructed 
  reasons relates to production generally, apart from the production of the legal 
  opinion. <br>
</p>
<p>[17] In concluding that the legal opinion was not protected by solicitor-client 
  privilege and must therefore be produced, the motions judge stated at para. 
  57:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">It seems to me, however, that the Human Rights Commission 
  is in many ways like the Workers' Compensation Board in the sense that it is 
  not adverse in interest to claimants who come to it seeking to enforce their 
  rights. The Human Rights Commission is the guardian, to whom the legislature 
  has entrusted the most important of duties and responsibilities - the enforcement 
  of human rights. Because there is no adversity, I share the view expressed by 
  the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in Melanson v. Workers' Compensation Board 
  (N.B.) (1994), 146 N.B.R. (2d) 294; 374 A.P.R. 294; 25 Admin. L.R. (C.A.), at 
  228 [Admin. L.R.] as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent10">Having indicated my intended disposition of this case, I want 
  to say something with respect to the legal opinions which the W.C.B. refused 
  to produce. As I see it, the opinions are not privileged.</p>
<p class="indent10">The fundamental premise, the reason for protecting the opinions, 
  is missing. The social legislation creating the Workers' Compensation Board 
  does not purport to make the board a party adverse in interest to claimants. 
  It may be that employers and employees have traditional adversarial interests, 
  but the board ought not to be, or perceive itself to be, a party with interest 
  inimical to them or either of them. It manages an enormous fund and is charged 
  with the unique responsibility of determining the validity of claims coming 
  within the scope of its responsibility. To a certain extent, as authorized by 
  the Legislature of New Brunswick, it may create policy and interpret its own 
  legislation, but it must not meddle in the claims procedure when that has been 
  given over to specially created bodies established by by-laws. The review committee 
  and the appeals board must be permitted to function independently so that they 
  fulfil their raison d'&ecirc;tre according to the objectives set forth in the 
  by-laws creating them. Each claim, despite policy, must be considered on its 
  own merits.</p>
<p class="indent10">Legal opinions given in relation to the interpretation of 
  legislation which is germane to a claim before one of the board's tribunals 
  is [sic] not privileged. Such professional opinions are, in my view, for the 
  benefit of employers, employees, and dependants in the processing of claims 
  by the Workers' Compensation Board, not simply something for the exclusive use 
  of the board. When the W.C.B. is in an adversarial position or has caused the 
  legal opinion to be generated for matters unrelated to claims, a solicitor-client 
  privilege relationship arises vis-&agrave;-vis other parties. However, when 
  the legal opinions relate to the interpretation of W.C.B. legislation or the 
  duty or obligation to pay claims, they must not be withheld from the employers, 
  employees or their dependants. Privilege does not attach. When the opinions 
  were requested, litigation was not contemplated nor in hand as between the administrator 
  of the fund and the employer, employee, or a dependant. See Solosky v. Canada, 
  [1980] 1 S.C.R. 821, per Dickson J. at pp. 833-834.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] The motions judge then concluded at para. 58:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, there is no basis upon which the Commission 
  here can claim privilege for a legal opinion they admit was before the Commissioners 
  when they considered their decision, which is the subject of this Judicial Review 
  application and it must be produced.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] In the reasons of the motions judge there is much discussion of this Court's 
  judgment in Payne v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission) (2000), 192 D.L.R. (4th) 
  315 (Ont. C.A.). The Payne case involved the obligation of the Commission to 
  make general disclosure of information and did not deal with the particular 
  issue of solicitor-client privilege. It is therefore primarily related to that 
  part of the case at bar which is not under appeal in this Court.<br>
</p>
<p>DECISION OF THE FULL PANEL OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT<br>
</p>
<p>[20] On the review of the motions judge's order, the full panel of the Divisional 
  Court, in a very brief endorsement, affirmed her decision and expressly approved 
  her application of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal's decision in Melanson, 
  supra.<br>
</p>
<p>REVIEW OF THE LEGAL OPINION BY THE COURT<br>
</p>
<p>[21] The legal opinion was not produced to MacFarland J. or the three-judge 
  panel for review. Before us, there was some initial disagreement between counsel 
  for the Commission and counsel for Ms. Pritchard concerning whether the opinion 
  should be produced for review by the Court. Counsel for Ms. Pritchard submitted 
  in her factum that there was no evidence as to the nature of the contents of 
  the document nor as to any expectation of confidentiality. Counsel for Ms. Pritchard 
  also submitted that the Court should only review the document where the party 
  asserting the privilege has filed an affidavit which sets out a prima facie 
  case of privilege and where the party seeking production is the one who has 
  made the request of the Court to review it. Since neither of these circumstances 
  obtained the document ought not to be reviewed by the Court. Counsel for the 
  Commission submitted in her factum that the Court should review the document. 
  Counsel for the Attorney General took the position that it is only advisable 
  for the Court to review the document in question if there is a dispute as to 
  whether it is a legal opinion.<br>
</p>
<p>[22] On the hearing of the appeal, all counsel agreed that we should review 
  the document and so we did. After we reviewed the document, the President of 
  the panel advised counsel that the document was indeed a legal opinion related 
  to the case and that it did not contain extraneous facts that were not included 
  in the case analysis prepared by the Commission and produced to the parties. 
  In light of my conclusion on this appeal, I would order that the copies of the 
  legal opinion filed with the Court are to be sealed. <br>
</p>
<p>THE DOCTRINE OF SOLICITOR-CLIENT PRIVILEGE<br>
</p>
<p>[23] The doctrine of solicitor-client privilege has been one of the cornerstones 
  of the English common law for centuries. Although historically it was regarded 
  as no more than a rule of evidence, it has developed into a much broader concept 
  that protects communications between a client and his or her lawyer in a wide 
  range of circumstances.<br>
</p>
<p>[24] There is a helpful analysis of the rationale and development of the doctrine 
  in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Solosky v. Canada (1979), 
  [1980] 1 S.C.R. 821. In that case, Dickson J. (as he then was) provided the 
  following commentary at pp. 833-836:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">As I have indicated, the main ground upon which the 
  appellant rests his case is solicitor-client privilege. The concept of privileged 
  communications between a solicitor and his client has long been recognized as 
  fundamental to the due administration of justice. As Jackett C.J. aptly stated 
  in Re Director of Investigation and Research and Shell Canada Ltd. (1975), 22 
  C.C.C. (2d) 70 at pp. 78-9:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent10">&#133;the protection, civil and criminal, afforded to the 
  individual by our law is dependent upon his having the aid and guidance of those 
  skilled in the law untrammelled by any apprehension that the full and frank 
  disclosure by him of all his facts and thoughts to his legal advisor might somehow 
  become available to third persons so as to be used against him.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The history of the privilege can be traced to the reign 
  of Elizabeth I (see Berd v. Lovelace (1577), 21 E.R. 33, and Dennis v. Codrington 
  (1580), 21 E.R. 53). It stemmed from respect for the 'oath and honour' of the 
  lawyer, duty-bound to guard closely the secrets of his client, and was restricted 
  in operation to an exemption from testimonial compulsion. Thereafter, in stages, 
  privilege was extended to include communications exchanged during other litigation, 
  those made in contemplation of litigation, and finally, any consultation for 
  legal advice, whether litigious or not. The classic statement of the policy 
  grounding the privilege was given by Brougham L.C. in Greenough v. Gaskell (1833), 
  39 E.R. 618, at p. 620:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent10">The foundation of this rule is not difficult to discover. 
  It is not (as has sometimes been said) on account of any particular importance 
  which the law attributes to the business of legal professors, or any particular 
  disposition to afford them protection (though certainly it may not be very easy 
  to discover why a like privilege has been refused to others, and especially 
  to medical advisers).</p>
<p class="indent10">But it is out of regard to the interests of justice, which 
  cannot be upholden, and to the administration of justice, which cannot go on 
  without the aid of men skilled in jurisprudence, in the practice of the courts, 
  and in those matters affecting rights and obligations which form the subject 
  of all judicial proceedings. If the privilege did not exist at all, every one 
  would be thrown upon his own legal resources. Deprived of all professional assistance, 
  a man would not venture to consult any skilful person, or would only dare to 
  tell his counsellor half his case.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The rationale was put this way by Jessel M.R. in Anderson 
  v. Bank of British Columbia (1876), 2 Ch. 644, at p. 649:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent10">The object and meaning of the rule is this: that as, 
  by reason of the complexity and difficulty of our law, litigation can only be 
  properly conducted by professional men, it is absolutely necessary that a man, 
  in order to prosecute his rights or to defend himself from an improper claim, 
  should have resource to the assistance of professional lawyers, and it being 
  so absolutely necessary, it is equally necessary, to use a vulgar phrase, that 
  he should be able to make a clean breast of it to the gentleman whom he consults 
  with a view to the prosecution of his claim, or the substantiating of his defence 
  against the claim of others; that he should be able to place unrestricted and 
  unbounded confidence in the professional agent, and that the communications 
  he so makes to him should be kept secret, unless with his consent (for it is 
  his privilege, and not the privilege of the confidential agent), that he should 
  be enabled properly to conduct his litigation.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Wigmore [8 Wigmore, Evidence (McNaughton revision) (1961) 
  para. 2292] framed the modern principle of privilege for solicitor-client communications, 
  as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent10">Where legal advice of any kind is sought from a professional 
  legal adviser in his capacity as such, the communications relating to the purpose 
  made in confidence by the client are at his instance permanently protected from 
  disclosures by himself or by the legal adviser, except the protection be waived.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are exceptions to the privilege. The privilege 
  does not apply to communications in which legal advice is neither sought nor 
  offered, that is to say, where the lawyer is not contacted in his professional 
  capacity. Also, where the communication is not intended to be confidential, 
  privilege will not attach, O'Shea v. Woods, [1891] P. 286 at p. 289. More significantly, 
  if a client seeks guidance from a lawyer in order to facilitate the commission 
  of a crime or a fraud, the communication will not be privileged and it is immaterial 
  whether the lawyer is an unwitting dupe or knowing participant. The classic 
  case is R. v. Cox and Railton (1884), 14 Q.B.D. 153, in which Stephen J. had 
  this to say (p. 167): &quot;A communication in furtherance of a criminal purpose 
  does not 'come in the ordinary scope of professional employment'.&quot;<br>
  Recent case law has taken the traditional doctrine of privilege and placed it 
  on a new plane. Privilege is no longer regarded merely as a rule of evidence 
  which acts as a shield to prevent privileged materials from being tendered in 
  evidence in a court room. The courts, unwilling to so restrict the concept, 
  have extended its application well beyond those limits [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>[25] Dickson J. in Solosky concluded at p. 839 that solicitor-client privilege 
  had evolved into a &quot;fundamental civil and legal right&quot;. In R. v. McClure, 
  [2001] 1 S.C.R. 445 at para. 2, Major J. made a similar observation when he 
  described solicitor-client privilege as &quot;fundamental to the justice system 
  in Canada&quot;. <br>
</p>
<p>[26] There is a useful formulation of the modern doctrine of solicitor-client 
  privilege by Lamer J. (as he then was) in Desc&ocirc;teaux v. Mierzwinski, [1982] 
  1 S.C.R. 860 at 875 that was reaffirmed recently by Arbour J. in Lavallee, Rackel 
  &amp; Heintz v. Canada (A. G.), 2002 SCC 61:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">It would, I think, be useful for us to formulate this 
  substantive rule, as the judges formerly did with the rule of evidence; it could, 
  in my view, be stated as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">1. The confidentiality of communications between solicitor 
  and client may be raised in any circumstances where such communications are 
  likely to be disclosed without the client's consent.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">2. Unless the law provides otherwise, when and to the 
  extent that the legitimate exercise of a right would interfere with another 
  person's right to have his communications with his lawyer kept confidential, 
  the resulting conflict should be resolved in favour of protecting the confidentiality.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">3. When the law gives someone the authority to do something 
  which, in the circumstances of the case, might interfere with that confidentiality, 
  the decision to do so and the choice of means of exercising that authority should 
  be determined with a view to not interfering with it except to the extent absolutely 
  necessary in order to achieve the ends sought by the enabling legislation.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">4. Acts providing otherwise in situations under paragraph 
  2 and enabling legislation referred to in paragraph 3 must be interpreted restrictively.<br>
</p>
<p>[27] In Lavallee, Arbour J. emphasized in very strong language the nearly absolute 
  nature of the doctrine of solicitor-client privilege. At para. 36, she said:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed solicitor-client privilege must remain as close 
  to absolute as possible if it is to retain relevance. Accordingly, this Court 
  is compelled in my view to adopt stringent norms to ensure its protection.<br>
</p>
<p>[28] While Lavallee and other cases refer to solicitor-client privilege as 
  being &quot;as close to absolute as possible&quot; there are exceptions. As 
  discussed by Dickson J. in Solosky, supra, if a client seeks legal advice for 
  the purpose of conducting some criminal activity, no privilege attaches to such 
  communication. Another exception was articulated in Smith v. Jones, [1999] 1 
  S.C.R. 455, when the Court held that where public safety is at stake, the privilege 
  may be abrogated but only if there is a clear and imminent risk of serious bodily 
  harm or death to an identifiable person or group. In McClure, the Court held 
  that, in limited circumstances where there is a genuine risk of a wrongful conviction, 
  the privilege may yield to allow an accused to make full answer and defence. 
  Also, of course, the privilege may be abrogated by statute. There are other 
  exceptions referred to in Solosky, supra. <br>
</p>
<p>THE MAIN POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES ON THIS APPEAL<br>
</p>
<p>[29] I do not propose to set out in full the positions of each of the parties. 
  What follows are the principal arguments which were advanced on behalf of each 
  of them.<br>
</p>
<p>[30] Counsel for the Commission argued that the privilege attaches equally 
  to communications with external legal counsel and in-house legal counsel. She 
  further argued that the privilege applies equally to all clients, without regard 
  to whether the client is an individual, corporation or governmental body.<br>
</p>
<p>[31] Counsel for the Commission further submitted that the New Brunswick Court 
  of Appeal decision in Melanson, supra, was distinguishable from the case at 
  bar in that the legal opinion ordered to be produced in that case was necessary 
  in order to permit the affected party to know the case she had to meet. In the 
  alternative, counsel submitted that the Melanson reasons in respect of solicitor-client 
  privilege were obiter.<br>
</p>
<p>[32] The Commission also relied upon the doctrine of deliberative secrecy to 
  support the withholding of the legal opinion. Finally, the Commission submitted 
  that if solicitor-client privilege did not apply, then the &quot;Wigmore criteria&quot; 
  for determining privilege on a case-by-case basis adopted by the Supreme Court 
  of Canada in Slavutych v. Baker (1975), [1976] 1 S.C.R. 254 at 260-261 were 
  satisfied and therefore served to protect the legal opinion from production.<br>
</p>
<p>[33] Counsel for the Attorney General supported the Commission. She submitted 
  that the Melanson reasons on the production of a legal opinion were obiter or 
  alternatively, represented a departure from the weight of previous authorities. 
  She also argued that the New Brunswick Court of Appeal's comments to the effect 
  that privilege attaches only when a public board is in an adversarial position 
  vis-&agrave;-vis the party seeking the opinion are wrong and that the Supreme 
  Court's judgment in Solosky does not support that conclusion.<br>
</p>
<p>[34] Counsel for the Attorney General also argued that there are valid policy 
  reasons why solicitor-client privilege ought to attach in the circumstances 
  here even where there is no adversarial context. She also pointed out that there 
  is nothing in the Code or the Judicial Review Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  J.1, requiring production of a legal opinion prepared for the Commissioners.<br>
</p>
<p>[35] Counsel for Ms. Pritchard argued inter alia that the legal opinion was 
  part of the record before the Commissioners and was required to be produced 
  in accordance with s.10 of the Judicial Review Procedure Act. She relied upon 
  the judgment of the courts below and in particular on the Melanson judgment 
  to support her position that there was no privilege attaching to the opinion. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[36] Counsel for Ms. Pritchard submitted in the alternative that if the Court 
  was of the view that solicitor-client privilege applied, then it had been waived 
  by the Commission. This submission was based on the fact that before the first 
  judicial review application, the Commission had produced a legal opinion of 
  another staff lawyer that had commented directly on the first decision that 
  the Commission had made not to investigate Ms. Pritchard's complaint.<br>
</p>
<p>DOES THE DOCTRINE OF SOLICITOR-CLIENT PRIVILEGE APPLY IN THIS CASE?<br>
</p>
<p>[37] There is no doubt that the document which has been described throughout 
  as a legal opinion is indeed a legal opinion provided by staff counsel to the 
  Commission. In my view, the only way that any court could hold that the legal 
  opinion is not cloaked with solicitor-client privilege is if it is abrogated 
  by statute; or it falls within one of the known common law exceptions to the 
  doctrine; or if the reasoning of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in Melanson 
  is adopted to create a new common law exception. <br>
</p>
<p>[38] As indicated above, counsel for Ms. Pritchard relied upon s. 10 of the 
  Judicial Review Procedure Act, which provides:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">When notice of an application for judicial review of 
  a decision made in the exercise or purported exercise of a statutory power of 
  decision has been served on the person making the decision, such person shall 
  forthwith file in the Court for use on the application the record of the proceedings 
  in which the decision was made.<br>
  Counsel submitted that the language of s. 10 is mandatory and therefore there 
  can be no expectation of confidentiality for any aspect of the record. From 
  this she reasoned that the doctrine of solicitor-client privilege is not available 
  in respect of any part of the record of the proceedings before the Commission 
  including a legal opinion. I disagree. <br>
</p>
<p>[39] If the Legislature had intended to abrogate the right of a party to a 
  judicial review application to claim the protection of solicitor-client privilege 
  for a legal opinion, it would have done so in clear and unequivocal terms. There 
  is nothing in s. 10 of the Judicial Review Procedure Act which gives any indication 
  that the Legislature intended to abrogate solicitor-client privilege.<br>
</p>
<p>[40] During the hearing of this appeal, reference was made to s. 39(6) of the 
  Code which provides:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">A member of the Board of Inquiry hearing a complaint 
  must not have taken part in any investigation or consideration of the subject-matter 
  of the inquiry before the hearing and shall not communicate directly or indirectly 
  in relation to the subject-matter of the inquiry with any person or with any 
  party or any party's representative except upon notice to and opportunity for 
  all parties to participate, but the board may seek legal advice from an adviser 
  independent of the parties and in such case the nature of the advice shall be 
  made known to the parties in order that they may make submissions as to the 
  law [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>It is important to note that s. 39(6) deals with the procedure that is to be 
  followed once a matter is referred to a board of inquiry (now called the &quot;Tribunal&quot;). 
  Under the Code, the Commission acts as an impartial investigator pursuant to 
  sections 32 to 36. Once the matter is referred to a board of inquiry, the Commission 
  is a party to the proceedings before the board and has carriage of the complaint.<br>
</p>
<p>[41] Counsel for the Attorney General took comfort from the above language 
  and submitted that the section did not require the production of a legal opinion 
  but only the nature of the legal advice received. She then submitted that there 
  was no other similar section of the Code which expressly required the production 
  of a legal opinion provided to the Commissioner.<br>
</p>
<p>[42] Counsel for Ms. Pritchard submitted that s. 39(6) of the Code, by analogy, 
  supports production of the legal opinion at the Commission (investigative) stage. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[43] In my view, s. 39(6) of the Code is not directly relevant. However, it 
  is an illustration that where the Legislature intends to abrogate or abridge 
  the right of a person to claim the protection of solicitor-client privilege, 
  it does so in express language. <br>
</p>
<p>[44] Ms. Pritchard quite properly relied on the judgments below and on the 
  Melanson case in the New Brunswick Court of Appeal. I turn now to consider that 
  case. I think it would be helpful to provide a brief summary of the facts in 
  Melanson. Mr. Melanson had a heart attack while at work. His widow claimed benefits 
  under the Workers' Compensation Act, R.S.N.B. 1973, c. W-13. Her initial claim 
  was denied but a review committee held that her husband died during the course 
  of his employment and allowed her appeal. However, for some reason, not readily 
  apparent from the case report, the committee did not communicate its decision 
  to Mrs. Melanson. The Chair of the Workers' Compensation Board then referred 
  the matter to counsel. Counsel retained a physician who concluded, after reviewing 
  the file, that Mr. Melanson's death was unrelated to his employment. Counsel 
  then provided an opinion that the medical report constituted new evidence. The 
  Chair of the Board forwarded the medical report together with the legal opinion 
  to the review committee, which proceeded to reverse its decision. Mrs. Melanson, 
  having been informed this time of the committee's decision, exercised her right 
  of appeal. There were a number of issues in the appeal. Suffice it to say that 
  during the course of these proceedings, her counsel pursued and obtained with 
  the assistance of the Court both the medical opinion and the legal opinion that 
  had not previously been provided to her. <br>
</p>
<p>[45] Counsel for the Commission and for the Attorney General invited the Court 
  to distinguish the Melanson case on its facts or to find that the Court's comments 
  in regard to solicitor-client privilege are obiter. <br>
</p>
<p>[46] While counsel may be correct in noting that the comments of the Court 
  in Melanson on the question of solicitor-client privilege were incidental to 
  the question before the Court and hence obiter, the Divisional Court's adoption 
  of its reasoning in deciding this case certainly was not. I am not prepared 
  therefore to disregard this decision on that basis.<br>
</p>
<p>[47] I agree that the Melanson case is distinguishable on its facts from the 
  case at Bar. That said, I come to a different legal conclusion than the Court 
  in Melanson and in the courts below irrespective of the differing factual context 
  of the two cases.<br>
</p>
<p>[48] Central to the motions judge's adoption of the reasoning in Melanson is 
  her conclusion that the Commission is not adverse in interest to Ms. Pritchard. 
  In Melanson, the Court's &quot;fundamental premise&quot; was that the Workers' 
  Compensation Board is not adverse in interest to its claimants. From that &quot;fundamental 
  premise&quot;, the Court in Melanson concluded that privilege did not attach.<br>
</p>
<p>[49] While I readily accept in the case at bar that the Commission is not adverse 
  in interest to Ms. Pritchard, I cannot accept that this so called &quot;fundamental 
  premise&quot; leads to the conclusion reached by the New Brunswick Court of 
  Appeal and by the courts below.<br>
</p>
<p>[50] In my view, there is nothing in any of the authorities of either this 
  Court or the Supreme Court of Canada which could lead to such a conclusion. 
  I note again the comments of Dickson J. in Solosky, supra, when speaking of 
  the expansion of the doctrine of solicitor-client privilege, he said that it 
  included &quot;any consultation for legal advice whether litigious or not&quot;. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[51] In Melanson, the New Brunswick Court of Appeal articulated a policy position 
  that professional opinions germane to claims before the Workers' Compensation 
  Board are for the benefit of employees, employers and dependants in the processing 
  of such claims and therefore should be produced to such persons. With respect 
  to medical opinions, I agree. However, I disagree with the Court's conclusion 
  that legal opinions related to the interpretation of Workers' Compensation Board 
  legislation or to the duty or obligation to pay claims fall into the same category 
  as medical opinions. <br>
</p>
<p>[52] With all due respect to the New Brunswick Court of Appeal, I am unable 
  to agree with its decision and I decline to follow it.<br>
</p>
<p>[53] Counsel for Ms. Pritchard also submitted that the principles enunciated 
  in Melanson are consistent with a line of cases in the Ontario courts in other 
  contexts which have held that no solicitor-client privilege attaches to a legal 
  opinion where a common interest exists for the parties to share information 
  set out in the legal opinion. Here she cited cases arising in executor/beneficiary, 
  insurer/insured and trade union/union member contexts. I have reviewed the cases 
  she cited and I am not persuaded that they advance the issue in the case at 
  bar. See: Ballard Estate (re) (1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 350; McKinlay Transport Ltd. 
  v. Motor Transport Industrial Relations Bureau, [1992] O.J. No. 5; McKinlay 
  Transport Ltd. v. Motor Transport Industrial Relations Bureau, [1992] O.J. No. 
  303; Samoila v. Prudential of America General Insurance Co. (Canada) (2000), 
  50 O.R. (3d) 65; Chersinoff v. Allstate Insurance Co. (1969), 3 D.L.R. (3d) 
  560.<br>
</p>
<p>[54] On a policy basis, I find the submission of counsel for the Attorney General 
  in the case at bar persuasive. Counsel submitted that it is desirable for statutory 
  decision-makers to engage in internal debates about which of several possible 
  interpretations of their statutory mandates best serve the public interest, 
  and to be able to weigh those interpretations against other considerations, 
  such as the procedures available to them to regulate or enforce different mandates. 
  Statutory decision-makers, who are often persons with technical expertise in 
  a particular area but not lawyers, need confidential legal advice with respect 
  to the interpretation of relevant legislation and other legal issues in order 
  to facilitate candid discussions. Further, it is my view that procedural fairness 
  can be achieved without the production of such legal opinions. The ultimate 
  question on any judicial review of the Commission's decision should not be whether 
  the legal opinion it received was correct or not, but whether the decision of 
  the Commission can be upheld. The legal opinion is therefore irrelevant.<br>
</p>
<p>[55] In my view, if we were to hold that legal opinions generated in such circumstances 
  are not cloaked with solicitor-client privilege, we would be creating an exception 
  which would clearly go against the weight of authority to the present time. 
  I believe such a change in the law is best left to the Legislature. <br>
</p>
<p>[56] Finally, counsel for Ms. Pritchard submitted that in the event we were 
  to find that solicitor-client privilege attaches to the legal opinion, we should 
  conclude that privilege has been waived by virtue of the Commission's having 
  produced an earlier opinion of another lawyer given prior to the first application 
  for judicial review. I do not agree that the production of another opinion related 
  to a different decision of the Commission (although a decision of the same character), 
  can constitute waiver of the privilege attaching to the second opinion. It is 
  clear that &quot;privilege can only be claimed document by document&quot;: see 
  Solosky, supra, at p. 837.<br>
</p>
<p>[57] In view of the conclusion I have reached in this case, it is unnecessary 
  to deal with the Commission's submissions in regard to deliberative secrecy 
  and the Wigmore criteria.<br>
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION<br>
</p>
<p>[58] In the result, the appeal is allowed, the order of the three-judge panel 
  of the Divisional Court is set aside and the order of the motions judge, only 
  as it relates to the production of the legal opinion, is similarly set aside. 
  The copies of the legal opinion, filed with the Court, are to be sealed and 
  placed in the court file.<br>
</p>
<p>COSTS<br>
</p>
<p>[59] This case raises an issue of first impression in Ontario. In the circumstances, 
  I would make no order as to costs. </p>
