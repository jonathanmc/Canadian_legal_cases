<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice John D. D. Evans of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice dated July 29, 2003.</p>
<p>
  WEILER J.A.:</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant seeks leave to appeal his sentence and, if leave is granted, 
  appeals his sentence of 5 &frac12; months in jail for assault causing bodily 
  harm. He has served approximately 1 month of his sentence. The appellant seeks 
  to have this court impose a conditional sentence for the balance of his sentence 
  or, alternatively, a suspended sentence.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant raises two grounds of appeal. First, he submits that the sentencing 
  judge erred in principle in not considering the imposition of a conditional 
  sentence. Second, he submits that the sentence was manifestly unfit. </p>
<p>
  [3] The chronology and underlying facts giving rise to the appeal are as follows. 
  On April 1, 2003, the appellant was arrested and charged with theft under $5,000 
  and possession of break and enter tools in Burlington, Ontario. He was released 
  pending trial upon entering into an undertaking with conditions, which included 
  a curfew of 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., except for employment. </p>
<p>
  [4] On April 23, 2003, the appellant was again arrested in Burlington and charged 
  with breaching this undertaking by failing to observe the curfew. The appellant 
  was again released pending trial upon entering into a second undertaking, which 
  included a condition that he remain at his residence (with his parents near 
  Burlington, Ontario) between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. and abide by house rules. </p>
<p>
  [5] On May 16, 2003, in breach of his undertakings, the appellant travelled 
  to Bracebridge, Ontario with his girlfriend and friend, Ben Schreiber. The appellant 
  rented a motel room intending to spend the weekend.</p>
<p>
  [6] On the evening of May 16, 2003 the victim and two of his friends met Ben 
  Schreiber at a local Mike's Mart and returned with him to the motel room rented 
  by the appellant, where they continued drinking. The victim, having spent most 
  of the evening in various drinking establishments, was very drunk. After the 
  victim left, Mr. Schreiber noticed that some money he had left on a table was 
  missing. He suspected that the victim had taken it. He and the appellant found 
  the victim nearby on the street. Schreiber accused him of taking his money. 
  The victim denied it. The appellant then struck him in the face and kneed him 
  in the stomach. The victim fell to the ground, where he was kicked and punched 
  by the appellant and Mr. Schreiber. The victim then took money out of his pocket 
  and gave it to Mr. Schreiber. The appellant and Mr. Schreiber returned to the 
  motel room. They were arrested the following morning and charged with the offences 
  that form the subject of this sentence appeal.</p>
<p>
  [7] As a result of the assault, the victim suffered a black eye, a laceration 
  around one eyebrow (which required three or four stitches), abrasions to his 
  left elbow, which left a scar, and abrasions to his right flank, for which he 
  was treated in hospital.</p>
<p>
  [8] On July 8, 2003, Ben Schreiber was sentenced to 2 months imprisonment following 
  a guilty plea to assault causing bodily harm and one count of breach of a curfew. 
  He had already served 53 days of pre-trial custody for which the sentencing 
  judge credited him on a two for one basis and the effective sentence was therefore 
  6 months. In addition, he was placed on probation for two years. Mr. Schreiber 
  did not have a criminal record but was on release at the time for the offence 
  of robbery. </p>
<p>
  [9] On July 23, 2003, the appellant plead guilty to some of the Burlington charges. 
  Namely, he plead guilty to theft under $5,000, two counts of possession under 
  $5,000 and one count of fail to comply. He received a 40 day conditional sentence 
  to be followed by 15 months of probation. </p>
<p>
  [10] On July 29, 2003, the appellant plead guilty to assault causing bodily 
  harm and two counts of failing to comply with an undertaking before Mr. Justice 
  Evans of the Ontario Court of Justice sitting in Bracebridge, Ontario. He was 
  twenty years old at the time and he had the benefit of a good and supportive 
  family background.</p>
<p>
  [11] Following the appellant's plea of guilt, defence counsel (who is not counsel 
  on this appeal) asked the judge to impose a sentence that would allow the appellant 
  to attend a business accounting program at the community college to which he 
  had been admitted and suggested a &quot;short, sharp&quot; period of incarceration. 
  The Crown sought a period of incarceration of 9 to 12 months noting that the 
  assault, which included kicking the victim in the body and head area while he 
  was down on the ground, could have resulted in far more serious injuries and 
  that deterrence and denunciation were paramount.</p>
<p>
  [12] The sentencing judge sentenced the appellant to 5 &frac12; months imprisonment 
  for the assault and two months concurrent on each fail to comply. This sentence 
  was in addition to 7 days served in pre-trial custody. In addition, a D.N.A. 
  order and a weapons prohibition for five years were imposed. </p>
<p>
  [13] With respect to the first ground of appeal, we note that at no time during 
  the proceedings did the appellant's counsel ask the sentencing judge to consider 
  imposing a conditional sentence. Having regard to the positions of counsel at 
  the sentencing hearing, it is not surprising that the sentencing judge's reasons 
  for sentence do not reflect any overt consideration of whether a conditional 
  sentence was appropriate. In the circumstances, we are not persuaded that this 
  omission amounts to an error in principle. The sentencing judge was clearly 
  of the opinion that a conditional sentence was not appropriate having regard 
  to the principle of parity in sentencing and the appellant's disregard for the 
  conditions of his release at the time these offences were committed. The fact 
  that the appellant did not commit a further offence during the short time he 
  was on bail for these offences does not, in and of itself, mean that a conditional 
  sentence should have been imposed. </p>
<p>
  [14] With respect to the second ground of appeal, the appellant submits that 
  the sentencing judge did not balance the principle of rehabilitation against 
  general deterrence. Although the sentencing judge's reasons do not specifically 
  mention any sentencing principles, we are not persuaded that he failed to consider 
  rehabilitation as well as general and specific deterrence. The sentence he imposed 
  was midway between the period of incarceration sought by each counsel in his 
  submissions and is itself some indication that the sentencing judge was attempting 
  to balance these principles. In any event, the sentence was not manifestly unfit.</p>
<p>
  [15] In the absence of an error in principle or the sentence originally imposed 
  being manifestly unfit, we are not at liberty to interfere with the sentence. 
  We note that the fresh evidence filed, which indicates that the appellant is 
  attending his business classes and appears to be functioning satisfactorily 
  in the community, could be brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities 
  in support of a request that the appellant be considered for immediate temporary 
  absence or parole as soon as he is eligible. </p>
<p>
  [16] Accordingly, while we would grant leave to appeal sentence, the appeal 
  as to sentence is dismissed.</p>
