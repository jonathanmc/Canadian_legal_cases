<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant, R.A., was found guilty of theft under $5,000 and assault 
  with a weapon. He appeals from that finding. While the appellant also originally 
  appealed the disposition imposed by the trial judge we were advised at the hearing 
  of this appeal that the appeal as to disposition was being abandoned as moot.</p>
<p>[2] The first issue on this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in refusing 
  to reopen the proceedings to hear fresh evidence that the defence had obtained 
  between the date the appellant was found guilty and the date of his sentencing 
  hearing. The fresh evidence proferred was a letter from Much Music as to the 
  date a concert had taken place that was attached as an exhibit to an affidavit 
  of defence counsel's secretary. The secretary swore that the letter had been 
  received. There was, however, no evidence as to the truth of the contents of 
  the letter. In addition, there was no evidence as to whether the group had performed 
  at Much Music only on the day in issue or on other dates as well. We would dismiss 
  this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>[3] In relation to the count of theft, the identity of the appellant was admitted 
  at trial. Thus, the second ground of appeal relates to the assault charge only. 
  In relation to the assault charge, the appellant submits that the decision was 
  unreasonable. The appellant submits that the identification evidence was fraught 
  with frailty having regard to the condition of the complainant at the time of 
  the assault, and having regard to the eyewitness identification evidence of 
  the appellant by the complainant's girlfriend. In our opinion the trial judge's 
  decision was not unreasonable and he was entitled to reach the conclusion that 
  he did on the identification evidence. </p>
<p>[4] With regard to the theft conviction the trial judge did not err on the 
  issue of mens rea. There was no evidence to support the submission that the 
  appellant had a colour of right to the cell phone. The appellant himself conceded 
  that he refused to return the cell phone when asked. </p>
<p>[5] The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
