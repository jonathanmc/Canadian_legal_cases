<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of assaulting his wife, causing her bodily 
  harm, and with choking her with intent to enable him to commit the offence of 
  assault causing bodily harm. We did not call upon the Crown with respect to 
  the conviction for assault causing bodily harm, which was amply made out on 
  the evidence. We would, however, set aside the conviction for choking. The record 
  does not make out that the alleged choking was anything other than part and 
  parcel of the appellant's assault on his wife, and does not bear out the finding 
  that the choking took place in order to enable the appellant to continue or 
  facilitate his assaultive behaviour.</p>
<p>[2] For these reasons, we would set aside the appellant's conviction on count 
  2 and enter an acquittal on that count. The appeal is otherwise dismissed.</p>
<p>[3] With respect to sentence, against which there is no appeal, we observe 
  that the sentence of 3 months plus probation is a fit sentence of the offence 
  for which the appellant's conviction has been affirmed.</p>
