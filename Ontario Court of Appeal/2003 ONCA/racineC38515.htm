<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Mrs. Racine has several complaints about the order of Boissoneault J. and 
  other complaints that are not pertinent to this appeal. However, we can find 
  no basis for interfering with the decision except to make a conceded adjustment 
  to the equalization amount.</p>
<p> [2] Mrs. Racine maintains that the 1979 agreement between her and her husband 
  should be recognized as binding. That is not the issue. It is binding. The issue 
  is whether the 1979 agreement operates to exclude the matrimonial home from 
  the calculation of the equalization payment. It does not, given its language 
  and the law as expressed by this court in Bosch v. Bosch. Secondly, Mrs. Racine 
  firmly believes that her husband has won a considerable sum in the lottery, 
  which should have been taken into account, but there was no evidence before 
  the applications judge supporting that claim and it is based on speculation.</p>
<p> [3] Mrs. Racine pointed out in her materials, and Mr. Ellery acknowledges, 
  that there was a double count in the calculation concerning one vehicle and 
  therefore, the equalization must be reduced by $10,500. In other respects though, 
  Mrs. Racine&#8217;s complaints do not provide a basis for interfering with the 
  order.</p>
<p> [4] The equalization payment is therefore reduced by $10,500 but in all other 
  respects, the appeal is dismissed. The respondent is entitled to his costs of 
  the appeal, fixed at $2,500.</p>
