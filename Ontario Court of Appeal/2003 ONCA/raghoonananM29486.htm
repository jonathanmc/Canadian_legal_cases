<p>SIMMONS J.A.:</p>  <p>
  [1] Simon Raghoonanan applies for bail under s. 20 of the Extradition Act, S.C. 
  1999 c. 18 (&quot;the Act&quot;). </p>  <p>
  [2] Mr. Raghoonanan was arrested in Etobicoke on November 30, 1999 following 
  a request by The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (&quot;Trinidad&quot;) on November 
  18, 1999 that a provisional warrant be issued under s. 12 of the Act for his 
  arrest. </p>  <p>
  [3] On January 18, 2001, Dilks J. committed Mr. Raghoonanan for extradition 
  on charges of murder and accessory after the fact to murder. Mr. Raghoonanan 
  has appealed that decision. He is also awaiting a decision from the Minister 
  of Justice under s. 40 of the Act concerning whether he will be surrendered 
  (&quot;the Minister's surrender decision&quot;).</p>  <p>
  [4] If convicted of murder, Mr. Raghoonanan faces a mandatory sentence of death 
  by hanging.</p>  <p>
  [5] Counsel are essentially agreed on the modifications necessary to the Criminal 
  Code test for release when dealing with an application under the Act. Accordingly, 
  the main issue on this application is whether Mr. Raghoonanan has met the requirements 
  of that test. </p>  <p>
  [6] For the reasons that follow, Mr. Raghoonanan's application for bail pending 
  the Minister's surrender decision is granted on terms to be settled following 
  submissions of counsel. His application for bail pending appeal is adjourned 
  to no fixed date returnable on two days notice following the Minister's surrender 
  decision. </p>  <p>
  Background to the Charge</p>  <p>
  [7] Mr. Raghoonanan and three others are jointly charged with the murder of 
  Clint Huggins (&quot;Mr. Huggins&quot;). Mr. Huggins was Mr. Raghoonanan's cousin. 
  He was found dead at the side of a road in Trinidad during the early morning 
  of February 20, 1996. He died as the result of being shot and stabbed. </p>  <p>
  [8] At the time of his death, Mr. Huggins was the key prosecution witness in 
  the impending trial of Dole Chadee, a reputed Trinidadian gang leader, and eight 
  of his associates, for four drug related murders on January 10, 1994. The prosecution 
  alleged that Chadee had ordered the execution of a former gang member and any 
  witnesses to his murder. Mr. Huggins was a party to the murders, but received 
  immunity for implicating and testifying against the others who were involved. 
  Immediately prior to his death, Mr. Huggins was in protective custody, awaiting 
  the trial.</p>  <p>
  [9] At about 5 a.m. on February 18, 1996, Mr. Huggins arrived unexpectedly at 
  the home of Leslie Huggins (another cousin) and Leslie's common-law wife, Swarsatee 
  Maharaj (&quot;Maharaj&quot;). Over the next two days, Mr. Huggins spent his 
  time socializing with friends and family, including Mr. Raghoonanan, who was 
  staying temporarily at Leslie Huggins' home.</p>  <p>
  [10] On February 21, 1996, Mr. Raghoonanan, Leslie Huggins and Junior Phillip 
  were arrested in connection with the Mr. Huggins' death. Mr. Raghoonanan and 
  Leslie Huggins gave exculpatory statements. Maharaj gave a statement on February 
  24, 1996 confirming their stories. The three men were released on February 24, 
  1996. Search warrants were executed at the homes of Leslie Huggins, Junior Phillip 
  and Mr. Raghoonanan's sister on February 25, 1996, but no incriminating evidence 
  was found. Junior Phillip gave an exculpatory statement on November 6, 1996.</p>  <p>
  [11] On November 4, 1999, Junior Phillip gave a further statement to police 
  allegedly implicating himself, Leslie Huggins, Arnold Huggins (another cousin), 
  and Mr. Raghoonanan in the murder. Phillip admitted to striking Mr. Huggins 
  on the head three times with a sawed-off shotgun. However, Mr. Raghoonanan contends 
  that the full contents of this statement, including any details about the role 
  of Mr. Raghoonanan, have not been disclosed.</p>  <p>
  [12] On November 11, 1999, Maharaj gave a statement to police allegedly implicating 
  Leslie Huggins, Arnold Huggins, Junior Phillip and Mr. Raghoonanan in the murder. 
  Once again, Mr. Raghoonanan contends that the details of this statement have 
  not been disclosed.</p>  <p>
  [13] On November 12, 1999, Arnold Huggins gave a statement to police disclaiming 
  any knowledge of a plan to kill Mr. Huggins, but acknowledging that he shot 
  him twice and claiming that it was an accident. Arnold Huggins' statement places 
  Mr. Raghoonanan at the scene of the killing.</p>  <p>
  [14] On November 16, 1999, Mr. Raghoonanan, Leslie Huggins, Arnold Huggins, 
  and Junior Phillip were jointly charged with the murder of Mr. Huggins. </p>  
<p> [15] On December 2, 1999, Maharaj gave a further statement to police. She 
  claimed that in the early morning of February 20, 1996, she, Mr. Huggins, Leslie 
  Huggins, Arnold Huggins, Junior Phillip, and Mr. Raghoonanan set off in two 
  cars to attend a Carnival event. Leslie Huggins drove a Nissan Laurel with Maharaj 
  in the front passenger seat and Mr. Huggins in the back seat. Mr. Raghoonanan 
  drove a Mitsubishi Lancer with Arnold Huggins in the front passenger seat and 
  Junior Phillip in the back seat.</p>
<p>
  [16] According to Maharaj, Mr. Raghoonanan followed the car driven by Leslie 
  Huggins. At some point, Leslie Huggins pulled over to the side of the road. 
  Mr. Raghoonanan pulled in behind him, turned off his headlights, but left the 
  engine running. Arnold Huggins came up to the Laurel, holding a gun, and told 
  Maharaj to go and sit in the Lancer. Junior Phillip joined Arnold Huggins. Mr. 
  Huggins got out of the Laurel and faced Arnold Huggins, who shot him. </p>  <p>
  [17] After the shot was fired, Mr. Raghoonanan pulled out from behind the Laurel 
  and drove to the next traffic light. He then made a u-turn and returned to the 
  scene, and stopped on the opposite side of the road. Mr. Huggins ran across 
  the highway towards the Lancer, but Leslie Huggins drove the Laurel across the 
  highway and knocked Mr. Huggins into a chain link fence. Mr. Raghoonanan backed 
  the Lancer up to where the Laurel had stopped. Arnold Huggins, Leslie Huggins 
  and Junior Phillip grabbed Mr. Huggins and put him in the back seat of the Laurel. 
  Leslie Huggins called to Mr. Raghoonanan to come and stab Mr. Huggins but Mr. 
  Raghoonanan remained in the Lancer. After stabbing Mr. Huggins, striking him 
  with a piece of wood, and setting the Laurel on fire with Mr. Huggins' body 
  inside, Leslie Huggins, Arnold Huggins and Junior Phillip got into the Lancer 
  and all five occupants drove away.</p>  <p>
  [18] According to Maharaj, after arriving at the Huggins/Maharaj residence, 
  Mr. Raghoonanan vacuumed the Lancer and told the others to throw their jeans 
  in the latrine. He also suggested that they get their stories straight because 
  the police would be questioning them. Leslie Huggins, Junior Phillip and Mr. 
  Raghoonanan told Maharaj to tell the police that Mr. Huggins had borrowed her 
  car and that they had not seen him since. Maharaj claimed that Leslie Huggins 
  told her that he had three million dollars to collect for killing Mr. Huggins. 
  She also said that she was with Leslie Huggins later when he disposed of the 
  gun and a knife. </p>  <p>
  [19] On February 26, 2000, based on the foregoing information, the Minister 
  of Justice issued an Authority To Proceed under the Act against Mr. Raghoonanan 
  on a charge of accessory after the fact to murder, even though the Trinidadian 
  charge was murder.</p>  <p>
  [20] On September 27, 2000, the Director of Public Prosecutions for Trinidad 
  undertook not to prosecute Maharaj for any criminal offence she was involved 
  in prior to that date provided she made full disclosure of all information she 
  had relating to Mr. Huggins' murder. On the same day, Maharaj gave a further 
  statement, describing a conversation on February 19, 1996 between Leslie Huggins 
  and Mr. Raghoonanan. Leslie Huggins asked Mr. Raghoonanan, &quot;[w]here we 
  going to get a gun from, how we going to do this&quot;. Mr. Raghoonanan replied, 
  &quot;[w]ell, go up to Mathura for Arnold, he has a gun&quot;. Leslie Huggins 
  replied, &quot;[o]kay&quot;.</p>  <p>
  [21] During a deposition on October 6, 2000, Maharaj apparently clarified her 
  understanding of what Leslie Huggins was referring to in saying, &quot;how we 
  going to do this&quot;. She said she understood he meant to kill Clint Huggins.</p>  <p>
  [22] On November 28, 2000, the Minister of Justice amended the Authority To 
  Proceed to include the offence of murder.</p>
<p>
  Personal Circumstances of Mr. Raghoonanan </p>  <p>
  [23] Mr. Raghoonanan was born in Trinidad on March 4, 1962. He first came to 
  Canada as a visitor on December 5, 1988. He applied for refugee status, and, 
  while living in Canada, attended a welding school and obtained a welding certificate. 
  When his refugee claim was denied, he purchased his own ticket and returned 
  to Trinidad.</p>  <p>
  [24] In May 1996, Mr. Raghoonanan was married, in Trinidad, to a woman he met 
  while in Canada. On October 31, 1996, with the benefit of his wife's sponsorship, 
  he applied to return to Canada, and eventually re-entered this country on September 
  30, 1998.</p>  <p>
  [25] On November 15, 1998, at age 36, Mr. Raghoonanan suffered a heart attack. 
  He underwent six-artery by-pass surgery on March 1, 1999. He suffered moderate 
  damage as the result of the heart attack, which could place him at risk for 
  the development of heart failure.</p>  <p>
  [26] Mr. Raghoonanan does not have a criminal record in Canada. In Trinidad, 
  he was once charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. 
  On September 10, 1998, he was reprimanded and discharged in relation to this 
  charge.</p>  <p>
  [27] At the time of his arrest, Mr. Raghoonanan was working as a welder. He 
  and his wife are now separated. Mr. Raghoonanan claims that the separation is 
  the result of the hardship caused by his incarceration.</p>  <p>
  The Proposed Sureties</p>  <p>
  [28] Mr. Raghoonanan's sister, Jean Huggins, and his mother, Lorna Raghoonanan 
  have offered to act as his sureties. Jean was born in Trinidad on November 2, 
  1956. Jean moved to Canada seventeen years ago and became a Canadian citizen 
  thirteen years ago. She works two jobs, one as a &quot;select packer&quot; at 
  a manufacturing company, and the other as a housekeeper at Etobicoke General 
  Hospital. With the income from her employment she supports herself, her mother, 
  and to a lesser extent her 25 year old son.</p>  <p>
  [29] Jean purchased a house on November 29, 2001, paying $25,000 in cash on 
  the purchase price of $227,000. Her son co-signed the mortgage and is therefore 
  also listed as an owner on title.</p>  <p>
  [30] Jean does not have a criminal record. She is aware of the allegations against 
  her brother. She claims that she learned about the possibility of charges from 
  her sister in Trinidad soon after the co-accused were arrested, and discussed 
  the possibility of an arrest with her brother. She says that he did not attempt 
  to hide or run away. She is prepared to sign a recognizance for $25,000 and 
  have her brother live in her home.</p>  <p>
  [31] Lorna was born in Trinidad on November 27, 1939. She came to Canada nine 
  years ago, is a Canadian citizen, and does not have a criminal record. Although 
  she goes out occasionally, most days she is at home. She has about $3000 in 
  savings and does occasional babysitting. Her daughter supports her. She is prepared 
  to sign a recognizance in an appropriate amount.</p>  <p>
  Interpretation of Legislation Setting Out the Test for Release</p>  <p>
  [32] Mr. Raghoonanan applies for bail under both ss. 20(a) and (b) of the Act:</p>  <p>
  20. Section 679 of the Criminal Code applies, with any modifications that the 
  circumstances require, to the judicial interim release of a person pending</p>  
<p class="indent"> (a) a determination of an appeal from an order of committal 
  made under section 29;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the Minister's decision under section 40 respecting 
  the surrender of the person; or </p>
<p class="indent">(c) a determination of a judicial review of the Minister's 
  decision under s. 40 to order the surrender of the person. [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [33] Subsection s. 679(3) of the Criminal Code is the applicable provision in 
  this case:</p>  
<p class="indent"> 679(3) In the case of an appeal referred to in paragraph 
  (1)(a) of (c), the judge of the court of appeal may order that the appellant 
  be released pending the determination of his appeal if the appellant establishes 
  that </p>
<p class="indent">(a) the appeal or application for leave to appeal is 
  not frivolous;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) he will surrender himself into custody in accordance 
  with the terms of the order; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) his detention is not necessary in the public interest.</p>
<p>
  [34] Mr. Raghoonanan relies on two distinct footings for bail under s. 20 of 
  the Act. Both counsel suggest that they be considered separately. With respect 
  to the application for bail pending appeal, the only modification Mr. Raghoonanan's 
  counsel suggests is under ss. 679(3)(c) of the Criminal Code. He submits that, 
  in the extradition context, the public interest in having the committal order 
  enforced weighs less heavily against the granting of bail than does the public 
  interest in immediate enforcement of a sentence where the appeal is against 
  a criminal conviction: see R. v. Farinacci (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.).</p>  <p>
  [35] Counsel for the respondent does not contest this modification, and I agree 
  that it is appropriate. </p>  <p>
  [36] With respect to the application for bail pending the Minister's surrender 
  decision, Mr. Raghoonanan's counsel submits that, in addition to the modification 
  required under s. 679(3)(c), a modification is also necessary under ss. 679(3)(a). 
  He says that two options are available. One is to ignore ss. 679(3)(a) altogether, 
  because there is no appeal to evaluate. The other option is to apply a test 
  modelled on that used in interim stay applications, namely, whether the applicant 
  has raised a serious question for the Minister's determination: see RJR-MacDonald 
  Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311. </p>  <p>
  [37] Counsel for the respondent submits that ss. 679(3)(a) should not be ignored, 
  and that the modified test should be &quot;whether the issues raised in the 
  applicant's submissions to the Minister are not frivolous&quot;.</p>  
<p> [38] I agree that ss. 679(3)(a) should not be ignored. Parliament has indicated 
  a clear intention in that section that bail not be granted unless the issues 
  raised by an applicant reach a certain threshold. The Minister's surrender decision 
  is triggered only once a committal order has been made. Although an executive 
  decision embracing considerations well beyond the Sheppard<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  test, and a decision subject to only limited judicial review, I see no reason 
  to exempt applicants from the obligation of demonstrating issues warranting 
  the Minister's consideration as a pre-condition to a release order. </p>
<p>
  [39] I adopt the test proposed by the respondent. It preserves the language 
  of s. 679(3)(a), and, in my view, is the practical equivalent of the test proposed 
  by the applicant. See R.J.R -MacDonald at paragraph 50 where the test is also 
  expressed as follows:</p>  
<p class="indent"> Once satisfied that the application is neither vexatious 
  nor frivolous, the motions judge should proceed to consider the second and third 
  tests&#133; [emphasis added]</p>  
<p>
  Analysis</p>  <p>
  i) Application for Release Pending the Minister's Surrender Decision</p>  <p>
  [40] I will deal with the application for bail pending the Minister's surrender 
  decision first. Counsel for the respondent concedes that Mr. Raghoonanan has 
  satisfied the first branch of the test for release. I agree. The charge pending 
  against Mr. Raghoonanan in Trinidad is murder. Section 4 of the Offences Against 
  the Person Act (Chapter 11:08 Trinidad and Tobago) provides:</p>  
<p class="indent"> Every person convicted of murder shall suffer death.</p>  
<p> Other provisions confirm that any sentence of death is to be carried out by 
  hanging.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a></p>
<p>
  [41] In United States of America v. Burns (2001), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 97, the Supreme 
  Court of Canada confirmed that, while there is no absolute constitutional prohibition 
  on extradition to face capital punishment, &quot;assurances [that the death 
  penalty will not be imposed] are required in all but exceptional cases&quot;. 
  In this case, because of the mandatory nature of the penalty to be imposed, 
  there is no indication of how such assurances might be provided. However, the 
  Minister is entitled, under ss. 44(2) of the Act, to refuse to make a surrender 
  order &quot;if satisfied that the conduct in respect of which the extradition 
  request is made is punishable by death&quot;. In addition, under ss. 40(3) of 
  the Act, the Minister is entitled to impose a condition that the person be prosecuted 
  only for the offence specified in the surrender order.</p>  <p>
  [42] It is not for this court to speculate concerning the Minister's ultimate 
  decision. However, in my view, it is clear that the mandatory death penalty 
  provision raises an issue for the Minister's consideration that is far from 
  frivolous.</p>  <p>
  [43] Nevertheless, there are important factors weighing against Mr. Raghoonanan's 
  release under the second and third branches of the test. On the second branch 
  of the test, the mandatory death penalty in the event of conviction undoubtedly 
  gives rise to a strong temptation to flee weighing against the likelihood of 
  surrender. On the third branch of the test, there are several factors that weigh 
  against release. They include the finding by a Superior Court judge that there 
  is sufficient evidence to warrant a committal; the seriousness of the charge; 
  the fact that the murder amounted to a contract killing of a state witness; 
  and the importance of Canada fulfilling its international obligations. </p>  <p>
  [44] However, I am satisfied that Mr. Raghoonanan has met the test for release 
  for four reasons.</p>  
<p> [45] First, dealing with the second branch of the test, aside from the discharge 
  that I have referred to, Mr. Raghoonanan has no criminal record. In particular, 
  he has no history of offences for failing to appear or breaching court orders. 
  Significantly, there is no evidence in the record before me of any attempt to 
  evade these charges.<a href="#r3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a></p>
<p>
  [46] Second, other than in Trinidad, Mr. Raghoonanan's roots are in this community. 
  He lived and worked here after leaving Trinidad between 1988 and 1995, and again, 
  subsequent to 1998. His mother, one sister, and his estranged wife all live 
  here. Aside from an unsubstantiated suggestion in the Trinidadian request for 
  a provisional arrest warrant, dated November 18, 1999, that Mr. Raghoonanan 
  &quot;is a member of a notorious drug gang&quot; in Trinidad, there is no suggestion 
  that, once his travel documents have been surrendered, Mr. Raghoonanan has the 
  type of connections that could enable him to flee. Finally, although his health 
  problems would not appear to preclude his ability to flee, they do not enhance 
  the prospect of flight. </p>  <p>
  [47] Third, I am satisfied that Mr. Raghoonanan's mother and sister are appropriate 
  sureties and that satisfactory conditions of supervision can be fashioned to 
  minimize any risk that Mr. Raghoonanan will not surrender. I had concerns that, 
  in their affidavits, neither proposed surety addressed their views on fulfilling 
  their obligations even if it means Mr. Raghoonanan will face the death penalty. 
  However, both indicated their willingness to comply with the obligations of 
  a surety, and neither was cross-examined. Moreover, the decision in Burns raises 
  a serious question concerning the likelihood of an outright surrender. </p>  <p>
  [48] Significantly, Jean has worked long and hard to establish herself, her 
  son, and her mother in this country. Lorna is dependant on Jean for her support. 
  I conclude that there is a strong probability that neither would do anything 
  to jeopardize all that Jean has accomplished in this country. In my view, both 
  the flight risk posed by the prospect of the death penalty and any risk that 
  the sureties would fail to fulfill their obligations because of it can be minimized 
  by requiring Mr. Raghoonanan's arrest or surrender into custody prior to the 
  Minister's surrender decision. </p>  <p>
  [49] In summary, I am satisfied that, provided appropriate conditions are imposed, 
  Mr. Raghoonanan has established that he will surrender into custody. </p>  <p>
  [50] Fourth, turning to the third branch of the test, I conclude that four important 
  considerations militate in favour of Mr. Raghoonanan's release. </p>  
<p> [51] One, although Mr. Raghoonanan has been committed for extradition, unlike 
  in the ordinary situation of bail pending appeal, the presumption of innocence 
  remains operative, as does the Charter right not to be denied reasonable bail 
  without just cause. <a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a></p>
<p>
  [52] Two, to the extent that it has been disclosed, the prosecution's case against 
  Mr. Raghoonanan rests primarily on the testimony of a witness who has provided 
  contradictory and piecemeal statements and who has been granted immunity from 
  prosecution. While I would not describe the prosecution's case against Mr. Raghoonanan 
  as frail, I conclude that it is less than formidable. </p>  <p>
  [53] Three, Mr. Raghoonanan has raised what I would describe as a very serious 
  issue for the Minister's consideration. Again, without speculating on the Minister's 
  ultimate decision, Mr. Raghoonanan's submissions raise a very serious issue 
  concerning whether a surrender order will be made. </p>  
<p> [54] Four, although he waived the time limit in s. 40 of the Act for the Minister's 
  surrender decision in order to secure an extension of time for making his submissions 
  to the Minister, Mr. Raghoonanan has now been waiting for the Minister's decision 
  for more than fourteen months. Counsel for the respondent advises that the Minister 
  is actively considering this matter. However, the outer limit under the Act 
  for the Minister's surrender decision is 150 days<a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="r5"></a> 
  from the date of committal. </p>
<p>
  [55] Absent a waiver, in default of a surrender decision within the stipulated 
  time periods, a detained person is entitled to apply, under s. 69 of the Act, 
  for an order that he be discharged out of custody. Although a waiver was given 
  in this case, I do not consider that that means it is therefore unnecessary 
  that the Minister's surrender decision be made in a timely way. Excluding the 
  time frame required for Mr. Raghoonanan submissions, the elapsed time in this 
  case is almost three times the usual outer limit, and there is no indication 
  of when the Minister's surrender decision will be forthcoming. I conclude that 
  the continuing delay is one of the factors weighing in favour of a release order. 
  </p>  <p>
  [56] Taking these four considerations into account, I am satisfied that Mr. 
  Raghoonanan has demonstrated that the public interest considerations favouring 
  his release outweigh those favouring his detention, and that his continued detention 
  pending the Minister's surrender decision is not necessary in the public interest. 
  </p>  
<p> ii) Application for Release Pending Appeal of the Committal Order</p>
<p>
  [57] I have decided to adjourn Mr. Raghoonanan's application for bail pending 
  his appeal of the committal order for two reasons. First, in my view, if his 
  appeal from the committal order meets the test of &quot;not frivolous&quot;, 
  it does so barely. Second, I have concluded that the risk of flight could change 
  significantly based on the Minister's surrender decision, and that Mr. Raghoonanan 
  should surrender as a condition of bail pending that decision. In these circumstances, 
  it is more appropriate that the application for bail pending appeal be disposed 
  after the Minister's surrender decision is made. </p>  <p>
  Disposition</p>  <p>
  [58] Mr. Raghoonanan's application for bail pending the Minister's surrender 
  decision is granted on terms to be settled following submissions of counsel. 
  The release order shall not be effective until the terms of release are settled. 
  Counsel were to submit proposed conditions for release in any event. If deemed 
  appropriate, counsel may seek an appointment for an attendance through the registrar 
  of this court. Any such attendance may be in person or by conference call.</p>  <p>
  [59] Mr. Raghoonanan's application for bail pending appeal is adjourned to no 
  fixed date returnable on two days notice following the Minister's surrender 
  decision. </p>  <p>

  [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067.</P>
<p><a name="2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a> On October 13, 2000 the Offences Against 
  the Person (Amendment) (No. 2) Act was enacted. It apparently creates three 
  categories of murder, only one of which carries a mandatory sentence of death. 
  However, in his submissions to the Minister Mr. Raghoonanan claims that the 
  new law will make no difference in this case because, even if the new law applies, 
  capital murder includes contract killings and the murder of a witness. </P>
<p><a name="3"></a><a href="#r3">[3]</a> There is a statement in the November 
  18, 1999 letter from the Attorney General of Trinidad requesting that a provisional 
  arrest warrant be issued that &quot;Leslie Huggins and Junior Phillip are in 
  custody for the murder of Thackoor Boodram, Dole Chadee's brother. When these 
  two men were arrested for the murder of Thackoor Boodram, Simon Raghoonanan 
  left Trinidad for Canada&quot;. However, it is not clear that this was intended 
  as a suggestion that Mr. Raghoonanan fled as a result of these arrests. In any 
  event, there is no evidence or particulars in the record supporting such an 
  inference nor any response to Mr. Raghoonanan's assertion that he applied to 
  return to Canada on October 31, 1996 and that his application required clearance 
  from Trinidadian police.</P>

</P>
<p><a name="5"></a><a href="#r5">[5]</a> Section 40(1) of the Act prescribes an 
  initial period of 90 days for the surrender decision. Section 40(5)(b) allows 
  the Minister to extend that time frame for one additional period, not exceeding 
  60 days. Although s. 41(1) allows the Minister to postpone the surrender decision 
  pending appeal of the committal order on filing a notice of postponement with 
  the court of appeal within the time period stipulated in s. 40(1), there is 
  no indication that that was done in this case.</p>
