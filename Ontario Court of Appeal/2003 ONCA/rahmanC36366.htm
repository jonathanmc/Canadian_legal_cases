<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Ted Matlow of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated November 7, 2000 and from the sentence 
  imposed by Justice Matlow dated November 14, 2000.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was tried, by a court composed of Matlow J. and a jury, on 
  numerous offences as a result of the shooting and wounding of the complainant 
  Kimberly McLean. He pleaded guilty to a charge of being in possession of a weapon 
  while under prohibition. He was acquitted on a charge of attempted murder and 
  was convicted of aggravated assault, discharge of a firearm with intent to wound, 
  and use of a firearm during the commission of an indictable offence. The last 
  charge was stayed on the Kienapple principle. In addition to having served 11 
  months in pre-trial custody, the appellant was sentenced to a total of 8 years' 
  imprisonment, plus a lifetime weapons prohibition and a DNA order.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant appeals against both conviction and sentence.</p>
<p>
  [3] The complainant testified that she met the appellant one evening while partying 
  with friends. Later, in the early morning hours, they proceeded to the appellant's 
  apartment where they had sex. At one point, the appellant took out a revolver, 
  pointed the gun at her and repeatedly pulled the trigger, eventually shooting 
  her in the neck. The complainant suffered life-threatening injuries with long-term 
  effects, which have a continuing devastating impact upon her life.</p>
<p>
  [4] The Crown's case rested almost entirely on the complainant's testimony. 
  Expert witnesses testified that the gun could not have been fired at the angle 
  and at the proximity described by the complainant.</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant did not testify and the defence did not lead any other evidence. 
  The defence position was that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt as 
  to the appellant's guilt because the complainant's evidence was unreliable and 
  she was not a credible witness. It was submitted that there was uncertainty 
  as to whether the appellant was holding the gun when it fired. It was also submitted 
  that if the appellant was holding the gun, there was uncertainty as to whether 
  the appellant had fired it accidentally.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appeal from conviction raises the following issues:</p>
<p>
  (a) Did the trial judge err by failing to give the jury an appropriate limiting 
  instruction regarding the evidence of the appellant's post-offence conduct?</p>
<p>(b) Did the trial judge err by failing to properly instruct the jury on the 
  position of the defence, and the evidence supporting that position?</p>
<p>[7] The appeal against sentence raises the following issues: </p>
<p>
  (a) Did the sentencing judge err by failing to consider mitigating factors?</p>
<p>(b) Did the sentencing judge err by overemphasizing the principle of denunciation, 
  resulting in a sentence that is excessive and unfit?</p>
<p>
  1. The Appeal From Conviction </p>
<p>(a) The Appellant's Post-Offence Conduct</p>
<p>[8] The post-offence conduct consisted of evidence of the appellant's delay 
  in obtaining help after the complainant was shot, and evidence of concealment, 
  which included the appellant asking the complainant to lie about the shooting, 
  his failing to remain at the hospital and his attempting to destroy the mattress 
  on which the complainant had bled after she was shot. The appellant concedes 
  that the evidence of delay in obtaining help after the complainant was shot 
  is relevant to his state of mind at the time of the shooting. The appellant 
  submits, however, that the evidence as to concealment is not relevant because 
  a defence of accident was raised and the attempts at concealment were equally 
  consistent with panic or fear. He submits that the trial judge should have instructed 
  the jury accordingly. We disagree. The conduct in issue was one course of conduct. 
  Like any piece of circumstantial evidence, evidence of concealment may be subject 
  to competing interpretations and must be weighed by the jury in light of all 
  the evidence to determine whether it is consistent with guilt and inconsistent 
  with any other rational explanation. See R. v. White, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72 at 
  para. 21.</p>
<p>
  [9] In addition, it was undisputed that the complainant was shot when she was 
  alone with the appellant in his bedroom. There were only two persons who could 
  have pulled the trigger. Given that the appellant did not testify, there was 
  simply no evidence supporting the suggestion that the complainant fired the 
  gun or that the shooting was accidental. Moreover, in the absence of evidence 
  to the contrary, the only reasonable inference was that the appellant intended 
  to wound the complainant. In the circumstances of this case, there was no real 
  possibility that the jury would lose sight of the innocent explanation for the 
  shooting advanced by the defence, or misuse the evidence of post-offence conduct 
  for an improper purpose.</p>
<p>
  [10] It follows, in our view, that the trial judge was not required to instruct 
  the jury that the appellant's post-offence conduct could not be used to draw 
  the inference that the shooting had been deliberate or that the appellant had 
  the specific intent to wound the complainant.</p>
<p>
  [11] Even if the appellant's post-offence conduct were somehow not relevant 
  to these issues, we would have no hesitation in concluding, in the circumstances 
  of this case, that the absence of a limiting instruction caused no substantial 
  wrong or miscarriage of justice. The evidence in support of the convictions 
  was overwhelming.</p>
<p>
  (b) The Trial Judge's Treatment of the Position of the Defence</p>
<p>[12] With respect to this ground of appeal, it is submitted that the trial 
  judge failed to adequately instruct the jury on two &quot;accident&quot; scenarios 
  advanced by defence counsel, namely: (i) the appellant had pulled the trigger 
  accidentally; and (ii) the appellant had pulled the trigger believing, incorrectly, 
  that there was no bullet in the chamber.</p>
<p>
  [13] The trial judge charged the jury in accordance with his pre-charge discussion 
  with defence counsel. More specifically, although the instructions of the trial 
  judge on this issue were brief, he highlighted the frailties of the complainant's 
  evidence and instructed the jury to assess whether they undermined her reliability 
  and gave rise to a reasonable doubt. He also raised the possibility that the 
  complainant may have been holding the gun or that it may have discharged accidentally.</p>
<p>
  [14] Defence counsel, who was in the best position to gauge the fairness of 
  the charge, did not object to the trial judge's presentation of the position 
  of the defence. Moreover, given that the appellant did not testify and there 
  was no evidence supporting either accident scenario, we would not accede to 
  this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  2. Appeal from Sentence</p>
<p>[15] The Crown sought a global sentence of 10 to 12 years' imprisonment in 
  addition to pre-sentence custody of 11 months, combined with an order under 
  s. 743.6 of the Criminal Code. Defence counsel sought a global sentence of 3 
  to 4 years. The trial judge imposed a global sentence of 8 years' imprisonment 
  in addition to pre-sentence custody, including a one-year consecutive sentence 
  for possession of a revolver while prohibited. He did not impose the s. 743.6 
  order sought by the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [16] The appellant terrorized the complainant in his apartment. It was only 
  a fortuitous accident of fate that he did not kill her. He deserves little credit 
  for his tardy efforts to obtain medical assistance for the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [17] The trial judge noted the young age (23) of the appellant and his prior 
  criminal record. He also noted the absence of evidence explaining what mental 
  forces led the appellant to shoot and injure the complainant. He concluded that 
  the appellant had demonstrated that he represents a danger to society.</p>
<p>
  [18] Although there is a wide range of sentences imposed for crimes bearing 
  some similarity to those in this case, the sentence ordered by the trial judge 
  falls within the acceptable range of sentences imposed for comparable offences. 
  The sentence reflects no error in principle and is fit.</p>
<p>
  [19] Accordingly, the appeal with respect to conviction is dismissed. Leave 
  to appeal sentence is granted, and the appeal against sentence is dismissed.</p>
