<p>A review of the detention orders made on October 9, 2002 by Justice P.R. German 
  pursuant to s. 680.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The applicants who are husband and wife are charged with the second degree 
  murder of their eleven month old son. They were arrested in August 2002, some 
  eight months after his death. The applicants were denied bail in October 2002 
  by German J. In December 2002, the Chief Justice of Ontario ordered a review 
  of that denial of bail. A preliminary inquiry is scheduled for July 2003.</p>
<p>
  [2] The case against the applicants appears to be formidable. There is evidence 
  that the young child suffered multiple trauma injuries on at least three occasions 
  prior to his death. The injuries which resulted in death occurred shortly before 
  death and there is evidence that the applicants had exclusive opportunity to 
  inflict those injuries. <br>
  [3] The applicants have no record and have strong support from family and friends. 
  </p>
<p> [4] German J. relied on the secondary ground in concluding that the applicants 
  had not shown cause why they should be released. She was concerned that if released, 
  the applicants might gain access to or custody of Sabrina, their other child. 
  Sabrina was born in August 2002. German J. was concerned that some harm could 
  come to Sabrina if the applicants gained access or custody of her. German J. 
  also expressed concern that the applicants' parents could not be relied on to 
  comply with or enforce any bail order purported to prevent the applicants from 
  seeing Sabrina. German J. was not impressed with the parents who testified before 
  her on the bail hearing. <br>
</p>
<p>[5] In denying bail, German J. concluded:</p>
<p class="indent"> The birth of Sabrina in August 2002 is a very complicating 
  factor in this bail application. Mrs. Gail Rajab is so biased in favour of her 
  son's innocence that I believe she would not report any breaches of his bail 
  order to the police if she felt that it would be the cause of returning him 
  to jail. Even if I made orders that Tania and Joe could not see Sabrina, in 
  all the circumstances I am not satisfied that Joe Rajab and Tania Rajab would 
  comply with the order, and I do not have any faith that the sureties would enforce 
  it.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] We agree with the concerns of German J. and we accept her assessment of 
  the witnesses. We do not, however, agree that the detention of the applicants 
  was the only way to adequately protect Sabrina. Sabrina is currently in the 
  custody of the Children's Aid Society, which has commenced wardship proceedings 
  and is strongly opposed to any contact between the applicants and Sabrina. We 
  are satisfied that Sabrina can be protected without denying the applicants, 
  who are presumed innocent at this point, their freedom. We have in mind release 
  on a term which would prohibit the applicants from any contact or any attempt 
  to contact Sabrina either directly or through any intermediary. In making this 
  order, we have relied on the undertaking of Vivia Williams, the mother of Tania 
  Rajab, to withdraw her custody application and her undertaking that she would 
  not attempt to gain any access to Sabrina while these charges are pending. </p>
<p> [7] We think that the authorities, both the Crown and the Children's Aid Society, 
  are well positioned to guard against any attempt by the applicants to make any 
  kind of contact with Sabrina. We are not satisfied that the detention of the 
  applicants is the only way that Sabrina can be adequately protected. Detention 
  is not necessary on the secondary ground.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] German J. declined to make a detention order on the tertiary grounds. We 
  see no error in her assessment of that ground. The Crown does not suggest that 
  detention is necessary on the primary ground.</p>
<p> [9] In the light of our conclusion, it is unnecessary for us to consider the 
  fresh evidence tendered on this application, or the jurisdictional issue raised 
  by the Crown which, in our view, arises only if we were disposed to rely on 
  the fresh evidence.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] We will receive further submissions from counsel as to any other appropriate 
  terms and appropriate sureties. In our view, the parents of the applicants should 
  be sureties if for no purpose other than to impose a term upon them requiring 
  them to abstain from any contact with Sabrina. </p>
