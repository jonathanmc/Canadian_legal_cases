<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] While this was a very serious offence, it is not apparent from the trial 
  judge's reasons what weight, if any, the trial judge gave to the appellant's 
  prospects for rehabilitation. The appellant was a 15 year-old first offender 
  when this offence was committed. He is now nearly 18 and has completed the secure 
  custody portion of the disposition. He has done well during this period. In 
  our view, no further purpose would be served by keeping the appellant in open 
  custody. Accordingly leave to appeal sentence is granted, the open custody portion 
  of the disposition is struck out. The probation term will remain on the terms 
  imposed by the trial judge.</p>
