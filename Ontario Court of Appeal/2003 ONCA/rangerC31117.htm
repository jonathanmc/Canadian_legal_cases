<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice Eugene Ewaschuk of the Ontario 
  Court (General Division), now the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a 
  jury, on June 26, 1998.</p>
<p>
  CHARRON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I. OVERVIEW</p>
<p>
  [1] In the morning of August 16, 1995, two teenaged sisters, Marsha and Tamara 
  Ottey, were stabbed to death in their home. The appellant and his cousin, Adrian 
  Kinkead, were jointly charged with their murders. The charges were eventually 
  severed and the two men were tried separately.</p>
<p>
  [2] Following his trial by a judge and jury, the appellant was convicted of 
  first degree murder in relation to Marsha Ottey and of manslaughter in relation 
  to Tamara Ottey. The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the first 
  charge and to fifteen years' concurrent imprisonment on the second charge. He 
  appeals against both convictions. </p>
<p>
  [3] This court heard the appellant's appeal at the same time as it heard Adrian 
  Kinkead's appeal against his convictions for the murders of Marsha and Tamara 
  Ottey. This judgment deals with the appeal by Mr. Ranger only. </p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant advances numerous grounds of appeal in support of his overarching 
  contention that his trial was unfair. Some of the grounds relate to the admission 
  of evidence, the more significant relating to expert opinion and after-the-fact 
  conduct. With respect to the first category of evidence, the appellant argues 
  that the trial judge erred in admitting unscientific criminal profiling analysis 
  as expert opinion evidence. He submits that, in the result, the Crown effectively 
  and improperly couched its theory of the case in scientific terms by having 
  an expert link the crime scene, described as a staged break-in, to the appellant. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] With respect to the after-the-fact conduct, the appellant submits that the 
  trial judge erred in admitting evidence relating to his trip to Jamaica, months 
  after the events in question, as evidence of flight from which the jury could 
  infer a consciousness of guilt when there was no evidentiary basis to support 
  any such inference. The appellant submits that the prejudicial effect of this 
  evidence was further heightened by the narrative provided by the investigating 
  officer, describing first, how inmates at the prison in Jamaica were shouting 
  at him (after the appellant was taken into custody) that they wanted to kill 
  the appellant to avenge the Ottey sisters, and second, how a mob of 300 to 400 
  local people had gathered at the airport at the time of their departure from 
  Jamaica shouting &quot;shame&quot; and &quot;you shamed Jamaica.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [6] The other grounds of appeal concern the trial judge's instructions to the 
  jury, the more significant relating to the Crown's theory of false alibi, the 
  theories of liability, and the identification evidence. On the first point, 
  the appellant submits that the trial judge's instructions were inadequate to 
  remedy the prejudice occasioned by the Crown's suggestion to the jury that the 
  appellant attempted to fabricate an alibi when there was no evidence to support 
  such a theory. On the second point, the appellant submits that the fairness 
  of the trial was irremediably undermined when the trial judge, after the addresses 
  of counsel and contrary to the pre-closing submissions and pre-charge discussions, 
  left the jury with an additional theory of liability that the Crown had explicitly 
  disavowed. On the third point, the appellant submits that the trial judge's 
  instructions on identification evidence were inadequate to convey to the jury 
  the danger of accepting the very weak, but critical, evidence of two neighbours 
  who placed the appellant in the walkway across from the Ottey residence either 
  on the morning before, or the morning of, the homicides. </p>
<p>
  [7] I agree with the position advanced by the appellant on each of the grounds 
  of appeal that I have described so far. There can be no question that the cumulative 
  effect of these errors necessitates a new trial. I would therefore order a new 
  trial. </p>
<p>
  [8] I will deal in turn with each of the grounds of appeal that I have identified 
  as more significant. In light of my conclusion that there must be a new trial, 
  I will address the other grounds of appeal raised by the appellant only to the 
  extent that they may impact on the conduct of the new trial. </p>
<p>
  II. FACTS</p>
<p>
  [9] At the time of their deaths, Marsha Ottey was 19 years old and Tamara Ottey 
  was 16 years old. They both lived at home with their mother in Scarborough. 
  Marsha Ottey was a gifted athlete and had won a full track and field scholarship 
  to attend Arkansas State University. She was scheduled to leave for university 
  two days after she was killed. Tamara Ottey was a high school student, working 
  during her summer vacation. </p>
<p>
  [10] Avis Ottey, the mother of Marsha and Tamara Ottey, left for work at about 
  7:00 a.m. on August 16, 1995. Marsha and Tamara were both at home at the time 
  she left. Tamara was getting ready to go to work herself. Marsha had finished 
  working for the summer and was making final preparations to leave for Arkansas. 
  She was still in bed when her mother left for work. </p>
<p>
  [11] Avis Ottey returned home later in the day between 5:15 and 5:20 p.m. Once 
  inside, Mrs. Ottey immediately noticed that the furnishings were in a state 
  of disarray and that something appeared to be wrong. She tried to call 911, 
  but could not get a dial tone. She went to the basement, where she saw Marsha 
  lying on the floor. She ran to a neighbour's house to obtain assistance. Mrs. 
  Ottey directed her neighbour to the basement of her home, where the neighbour 
  discovered the dead bodies of Marsha and Tamara.</p>
<p>
  [12] Emergency crews arrived shortly after. Marsha Ottey was found partially 
  clothed, lying on her stomach. Tamara was found fully clothed, lying on her 
  side. Both sisters had been viciously stabbed and were covered in blood. Autopsies 
  revealed the cause of death for both young women as multiple cut and stab wounds 
  to their neck and chest areas. </p>
<p>
  [13] Although the house appeared to have been ransacked, nothing was taken other 
  than three items: a gold necklace given to Marsha by the appellant and which 
  she always wore, a videotape of Marsha playing soccer, and Marsha's electronic 
  organizer. Mrs. Ottey did not discover that the videotape and electronic organizer 
  were missing until several months later and there was some dispute at trial 
  whether these items were in fact taken from the home on the day of the homicides. 
  The state of the crime scene was the subject-matter of the expert opinion evidence 
  referred to earlier and more will be said about this evidence later. </p>
<p>
  [14] The appellant became an immediate suspect in the police investigation into 
  these deaths because of his relationship with Marsha Ottey. Marsha had met the 
  appellant in high school in 1990. The two began dating in 1991 and were involved 
  in a romantic relationship for about three years. Marsha Ottey ended this relationship 
  in the fall of 1994 because the appellant had become too possessive and controlling. 
  It was the Crown's position at trial that the appellant never accepted that 
  his relationship with Marsha was over and that he had relentlessly stalked and 
  harassed her. The evidence concerning the relationship between Marsha and the 
  appellant included the testimony of eighteen Crown witnesses who gave evidence 
  about statements that Marsha Ottey made to them after the break-up of the relationship. 
  Their evidence forms the subject-matter of one of the additional grounds of 
  appeal raised by the appellant that I will deal with at the end of this judgment. 
  </p>
<p>
  [15] The Crown's theory at trial was that the appellant decided that if Marsha 
  was going to go to the United States and he couldn't have her, then no one would 
  and that the appellant enlisted Adrian Kinkead to help him kill Marsha. According 
  to the Crown's theory, the appellant stood in the walkway across from the Ottey 
  home on the mornings preceding the homicides, staking out the early morning 
  activities at the Ottey home. On the morning of the homicides, the appellant 
  and Adrian Kinkead returned to the Ottey home. Mr. Kinkead intercepted Tamara 
  Ottey as she walked towards her bus and forced her to return to the Ottey house. 
  The appellant remained in the walkway across the street until Adrian Kinkead 
  and Tamara Ottey were safely inside, and then the appellant also entered the 
  house. </p>
<p>
  [16] The Crown called five of the Ottey neighbours in support of this theory. 
  The neighbours testified about seeing a man in a walkway across the street from 
  the Ottey home on the mornings preceding, or morning of, August 16, 1995 and 
  about seeing Tamara being led to her house by a man on the morning of August 
  16. Two of the witnesses gave evidence implicating the appellant as the man 
  seen the mornings before and the morning of the homicides. Their evidence is 
  the subject of appeal and will be described in more detail later. </p>
<p>
  [17] The police approached the appellant on August 17, 1995, the day after the 
  homicides. The appellant provided the police with a statement and with the clothes 
  that he had been wearing the day of the homicides. The appellant was placed 
  under 24-hour surveillance. During the subsequent investigation, no forensic 
  evidence was found to link the appellant to the crime scene. </p>
<p>
  [18] The investigation continued for months without any arrest being made. In 
  early January 1996, the police uncovered a central piece of evidence in the 
  case. Concurrent with the Ottey murder investigation, the police were investigating 
  the robbery-murder of a subway attendant and two aggravated sexual assaults 
  that occurred in October 1995. The appellant's cousin, Adrian Kinkead, was a 
  suspect in these investigations. During their investigation into these other 
  crimes, the police discovered that Adrian Kinkead's DNA profile matched a DNA 
  profile found under one of Marsha Ottey's fingernails. The police arrested Mr. 
  Kinkead in February 1996 and charged him with the murders of Marsha and Tamara 
  Ottey, as well as the murder of the subway attendant and the two aggravated 
  sexual assaults. In July 1997, Adrian Kinkead entered guilty pleas to the murder 
  of the subway attendant and to the aggravated sexual assaults. Following a trial 
  by judge and jury, Adrian Kinkead was convicted in June 1999 of the murders 
  of Marsha and Tamara Ottey.</p>
<p>
  [19] In February 1996, following Adrian Kinkead's arrest for the murders of 
  Marsha and Tamara Ottey, the appellant was arrested and also charged with these 
  murders. </p>
<p>
  [20] At the time of Adrian Kinkead's arrest, the appellant was in Jamaica. He 
  had travelled there with his father the month before, but had not returned with 
  his father as scheduled. The Crown's theory was that the appellant's overstay 
  was evidence of flight indicating consciousness of guilt and that the appellant 
  only returned to Canada when he realised that his life was in danger in Jamaica. 
  A police officer who went to Jamaica to bring the appellant back to Canada testified 
  about threats made about the appellant in Jamaica in connection with the deaths 
  of Marsha and Tamara Ottey. The evidence relating to the appellant's trip to 
  Jamaica is also the subject of appeal and I deal with it further on. </p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant and Adrian Kinkead had a very close relationship and spent 
  a lot of time together before August 16, 1995. The records for the appellant's 
  cellular phone established that the appellant telephoned Adrian Kinkead over 
  100 times between mid-June and mid-July 1995. Surveillance evidence following 
  the deaths of the Ottey sisters showed that the appellant's formerly frequent 
  contacts with Adrian Kinkead came to a complete stop, with one exception that 
  is not relevant to this appeal. </p>
<p>
  [22] Adrian Kinkead testified for the Crown at the appellant's trial. Mr. Kinkead 
  had previously given the police three versions of events, only one of which 
  implicated the appellant. Mr. Kinkead did not adopt any of these three versions 
  at trial. The trial judge ruled that Mr. Kinkead was an adverse witness and 
  gave the Crown leave to cross-examine him. Mr. Kinkead testified that he, the 
  appellant, and Tamara planned to take Marsha on a surprise farewell outing to 
  Canada's Wonderland on the morning of August 16, 1995. After the appellant and 
  Mr. Kinkead arrived at the house, the appellant and Marsha went to the basement. 
  Mr. Kinkead and Tamara were kissing when they heard a struggle in the basement. 
  They went downstairs to investigate. Mr. Kinkead saw the appellant threatening 
  Marsha with a knife. Tamara fainted when she saw the appellant. Mr. Kinkead 
  testified that he attempted to intervene in the struggle between Marsha and 
  the appellant. This was Adrian Kinkead's explanation of why his DNA evidence 
  was under Marsha's fingernail. Mr. Kinkead fled the Ottey home after the appellant 
  threatened him with a knife. He returned to the house later that morning to 
  see if the appellant was still there and to retrieve his hat. Upon his return 
  to the house, Mr. Kinkead discovered the dead bodies of Marsha and Tamara Ottey. 
  Mr. Kinkead did not call the police, but rather, called the appellant on his 
  cellular phone and arranged to meet him later that day. The appellant told Mr. 
  Kinkead not to talk to anyone about what happened, or else the two of them would 
  spend the rest of their lives in jail.</p>
<p>
  [23] The appellant did not testify or call any evidence at his trial. The defence 
  theory at trial was that Adrian Kinkead, a psychopath with a propensity for 
  violence, was the sole killer. The appellant relied heavily on a security videotape 
  that showed him at the Scarborough Town Centre minutes after the homicides, 
  arguing that this was extremely compelling evidence that he could not have been 
  present at the Ottey home when Marsha and Tamara were killed. The Crown's closing 
  submissions and the trial judge's charge to the jury regarding this evidence 
  are the subject of appeal and are discussed later in these reasons.</p>
<p>
  [24] I will now deal with each issue in turn.</p>
<p> <strong>III. THE EXPERT OPINION EVIDENCE</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong> A. The <em><em>voir dire</em></em> on admissibility </strong></p>
<p>
  [25] Detective Inspector Kathryn Lines is the manager of the Behavioural Sciences 
  Section of the Ontario Provincial Police. The Behavioural Sciences Section provides 
  the police with specialized investigative support services, including criminal 
  profiling. Criminal profiling involves the analysis of a crime scene and other 
  details about a crime, in conjunction with the analyst's understanding of cases 
  of a similar nature, for the purpose of inferring the motivation for the offence 
  and producing a description of the type of person likely to be responsible for 
  its commission. </p>
<p>
  [26] Detective Inspector Lines was contacted by the police investigators in 
  the Ottey case in September 1996, several months after the appellant and Adrian 
  Kinkead had been arrested and charged with the murders of Marsha and Tamara 
  Ottey. Detective Inspector Lines reviewed photographs and a videotape of the 
  crime scene and attended at the Ottey home herself. She also received information 
  from the police regarding their investigative findings as well as the post-mortem 
  reports. Based on all the information provided to her, Detective Inspector Lines 
  formed the opinion that whoever killed the Ottey sisters had staged a break-in 
  at the Ottey home, that the perpetrator had staged the scene in order to divert 
  suspicion from himself, and that the perpetrator had a particular interest in 
  Marsha Ottey. </p>
<p>
  [27] At trial, the Crown sought to call Detective Inspector Lines as an expert 
  witness regarding crime scene staging in order to elicit her opinion that the 
  crime scene in this case had been altered to look like a break-in. The Crown 
  submitted that this evidence was relevant to identity because a staged crime 
  scene is circumstantial evidence that the crime was committed by someone who 
  wants to divert suspicion from himself as a likely suspect, which in this case 
  would include the appellant. </p>
<p>
  [28] Defence counsel argued that the proposed evidence was not necessary because 
  the jurors did not require the assistance of an expert to determine whether 
  the crime scene appeared staged. In particular, defence counsel noted that the 
  evidence of another police officer, Detective Ian Mann, who identified photographs 
  and a videotape of the crime scene, already provided an evidentiary basis for 
  the jury to conclude on their own that the crime scene was staged. </p>
<p>
  [29] Based on the submissions of counsel, the trial judge ruled as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am satisfied that opinion evidence is needed in this case in the sense that 
  it will likely provide information that is outside the experience and knowledge 
  of the jury. The factual issue of whether a break and entry is authentic or 
  staged is not likely to be a subject within the common knowledge of the jurors. 
  This, of course, is subject to the Crown qualifying the proposed expert as an 
  expert in this particular area. </p>
<p>
  [30] Detective Inspector Lines was then called as a witness in the presence 
  of the jury. Crown counsel questioned the witness at length on her qualifications. 
  In the course of that testimony, she described criminal profiling very broadly 
  as &quot;a behavioural approach to criminal investigation&quot; and gave a number 
  of examples of the kind of services provided by the Behavioural Sciences Section. 
  </p>
<p>
  [31] Detective Inspector Lines testified that she had done criminal profiling 
  in approximately 1,000 cases, about 500 of which had been homicide investigations. 
  Twenty-five of the cases that she had analysed had involved crime scene staging, 
  half of which were homicides. In explaining the meaning of &quot;staging&quot;, 
  the witness stated that it was an activity that occurs where it appears that 
  the offender intends to misdirect an investigation. </p>
<p>
  [32] Before cross-examining Detective Inspector Lines on her qualifications, 
  defence counsel sought clarification of the scope of expert qualification sought 
  by the Crown. The Crown replied affirmatively to the trial judge's questions: 
  &quot;I take it you're proffering her as an expert witnesses in the area of 
  staged crimes, are you? And, in particular, as to whether or not there was a 
  staged break and enter in relation to the homicide of the two Ottey sisters?&quot; 
  Defence counsel then cross-examined Detective Inspector Lines on how an opinion 
  that a crime scene was staged could be verified. It appears from the witness's 
  testimony that no independent or objective process exists to verify an analyst's 
  staging opinions. Detective Inspector Lines testified, however, that one project 
  involving the utility and accuracy of criminal profiling was presently under 
  way.</p>
<p>
  [33] Following Detective Inspector Lines' testimony about her qualifications 
  and her field of expertise, the trial judge invited submissions from counsel 
  in the absence of the jury. Neither the Crown nor defence counsel made submissions 
  about Detective Inspector Lines' qualifications. The trial judge briefly ruled 
  that she was qualified &quot;to give expert opinion as to staged crimes.&quot; 
  </p>
<p>
  [34] Following this ruling, defence counsel expressed concern, and sought clarification, 
  about whether Detective Inspector Lines would be testifying about the motivation 
  of perpetrators. The Crown replied: &quot;I'm not going there at all.&quot; 
  The Crown explained that he would show Detective Inspector Lines photographs 
  of the crime scene and &quot;have her tell us by means of the photographs what 
  it is about this scene that tells her that it's a staged scene&quot;. A discussion 
  then ensued about whether the Crown could ask Detective Inspector Lines about 
  the only items missing from the Ottey home (a gold necklace, an electronic organizer, 
  and a videotape), which belonged to Marsha Ottey. Defence counsel was concerned 
  that this area of questioning went &quot;into the psychological and psychiatric 
  realm of what would be the motivation of a perpetrator&quot;, an area for which 
  the witness was not qualified. The Crown agreed to simply ask Detective Inspector 
  Lines whether the fact that these were the only missing items added to or detracted 
  from her opinion that the crime scene was staged. </p>
<p>
  [35] As I will describe in more detail later, Detective Inspector Lines' testimony 
  was not confined to the opinion that the crime scene was staged. Notwithstanding 
  the Crown's assurance that he would not elicit evidence relating to motivation, 
  Detective Inspector Lines' examination-in-chief included an opinion about the 
  motivation of the perpetrator for staging the scene and a description of the 
  most likely suspect as someone who had a particular interest in Marsha Ottey. 
  </p>
<p class="indent"><strong> B. The issues on appeal
</strong><p>
  [36] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in permitting Detective 
  Inspector Lines to give expert evidence. The appellant makes three arguments 
  in support of this ground of appeal. First, the evidence did not meet the reliability 
  or necessity criteria for admissibility of expert evidence set out in R. v. 
  <em>Mohan</em>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, 89 C.C.C. (3d) 402. Second, the trial judge improperly 
  restricted defence counsel's cross-examination of Detective Inspector Lines 
  when he sought to establish that her opinion may have been tainted by the opinion 
  of the investigating officers that the appellant was responsible for the murders. 
  Third, the trial judge's charge to the jury about this expert testimony was 
  deficient. Counsel for the appellant takes the position that, if the expert 
  testimony had been admitted, albeit in error, solely on the question whether 
  the crime scene was staged, this may be a case for the application of the curative 
  proviso. However, in light of the wider scope of the opinion evidence, it is 
  submitted that a new trial should be ordered on this ground alone. </p>
<p>
  [37] The Crown responds to this ground of appeal by arguing that defence counsel 
  did not object at trial to the reliability of the expert evidence, but limited 
  his objections to the necessity of this evidence. With respect to necessity, 
  the Crown argues that the jury likely would not have had any way to assess how 
  burglars typically behave and that Detective Inspector Lines' evidence offered 
  the jury insights into the normal behaviour of burglars, which would have assisted 
  the jury in deciding if the break-in at the Ottey home in fact was staged. The 
  Crown also argues that the trial judge properly restricted defence counsel in 
  his cross-examination when defence counsel attempted to ask Detective Inspector 
  Lines questions beyond her expertise. Last, the Crown submits that the trial 
  judge's charge regarding this expert evidence was fair and adequate, and that 
  the trial judge provided the jury with sufficient warning not to be overwhelmed 
  by the expert evidence and that he properly characterized Detective Inspector 
  Lines' evidence for the jury. </p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>C. The testimony of the expert witness </strong></p>
<p>
  [38] The Crown questioned Detective Inspector Lines extensively regarding her 
  opinion that the crime scene had been staged to look like the Ottey home had 
  been broken into. Much of the Crown's examination-in-chief of Detective Inspector 
  Lines was spent reviewing numerous photographs of the Ottey home as it appeared 
  after the discovery of the bodies of Marsha and Tamara Ottey, with the witness 
  explaining why, in her opinion, the depicted scenes appeared staged. </p>
<p>
  [39] As noted earlier, in addition to her evidence that the apparent break-in 
  to the Ottey home had been staged, the trial judge permitted the Crown to elicit 
  opinion evidence from Detective Inspector Lines about the motivations or characteristics 
  of the likely perpetrator. This happened on three occasions during the course 
  of the witness's examination-in-chief.</p>
<p>
  [40] On the first occasion, the Crown sought to ask Detective Inspector Lines 
  whether the fact that the videotape, but not its case, appeared to be missing 
  affected her opinion that the apparent break-in was staged. Defence counsel 
  objected to this question, arguing that this went beyond the scope of what had 
  been ruled admissible. The trial judge remarked that he had not made any specific 
  ruling with respect to the missing items. After hearing further from Crown counsel, 
  the trial judge observed that what the Crown was really seeking was an ancillary 
  opinion that this evidence suggested that the perpetrator was interested in 
  Marsha Ottey, and not Tamara. Crown counsel agreed with the trial judge's suggestion. 
  Defence counsel objected to this line of questioning, arguing that this required 
  speculation about the perpetrator's psychology, an area beyond the scope of 
  the witness's expertise. The trial judge rejected this position and permitted 
  the Crown to ask the question. Detective Inspector Lines testified that there 
  were two points of interest about the missing videotape. The first was that 
  the person who took the video would know what the contents were because of the 
  label and the second was that, in leaving the case behind, it might not be noticed 
  that the tape was missing.</p>
<p>
  [41] On the second occasion, at the beginning of the second day of Detective 
  Inspector Lines' testimony, the Crown advised that he intended to elicit Detective 
  Inspector Lines' opinion about the class of persons who normally engage in staging, 
  in addition to eliciting her opinion that the break-in to the Ottey home had 
  been staged. In connection with the issue of the class of persons likely to 
  stage crime scenes, the Crown sought a ruling permitting him to put to Detective 
  Inspector Lines a passage of a book entitled &quot;Crime Classification Manual&quot;. 
  The particular passage read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Staging is when someone purposely alters the crime scene prior 
  to the arrival of police. There are two reasons why someone employs staging: 
  to redirect the investigation away <em>from the most logical suspect</em> or 
  to protect the victim or victim's family. When a crime is staged, the responsible 
  person is not someone who just happens upon the victim. <em>It is almost always 
  someone who had some kind of association or relationship with the victim</em> 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [42] Defence counsel objected to this area of questioning on the basis that 
  the Crown, in essence, was putting its theory that the appellant fit within 
  the class of likely perpetrators through the mouth of the expert witness. Defence 
  counsel argued that this amounted to &quot;dime store psychology&quot; and that 
  it was very dangerous to admit this kind of evidence. The trial judge rejected 
  defence counsel's objection on the basis that the evidence would only go as 
  far as establishing that, if the break-in was staged, the perpetrator likely 
  would have known the victim. The Crown then proceeded to put the passage to 
  Detective Inspector Lines, who adopted its contents.</p>
<p>
  [43] On the third occasion, the Crown asked Detective Inspector Lines whether 
  she drew any inference from the facts that Marsha Ottey's identification was 
  found outside her wallet on a table top and that the only items missing from 
  the Ottey home belonged to Marsha Ottey. Detective Inspector Lines replied that 
  she drew an inference of &quot;a particular interest in the possessions or things 
  related to Marsha Ottey&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [44] In cross-examination, defence counsel first asked Detective Inspector Lines 
  questions relating to her relationship with the police investigators with whom 
  she worked on this case. Detective Inspector Lines described her role in the 
  following exchange: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q: So you obviously had discussions with the Crown and the 
  investigators about their theory of this crime, right?</p>
<p class="indent">A: Yes, sir, I did.</p>
<p class="indent">Q: And you know why you were being asked questions specifically 
  about missing items at the scene, right?</p>
<p class="indent">A: Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="indent">Q: And you know that the reason for doing that was to attempt 
  to link Mr. Ranger, in the box here, into this crime scene, right?</p>
<p class="indent">A: My purpose actually in them bringing this case to me, my 
  understanding was to provide an independent review. The purpose of my review 
  was an exercise to see if it did coincide with those investigators, and it did.</p>
<p class="indent">Q: Okay. And their view is that Mr. Ranger committed this crime, 
  right?</p>
<p class="indent">A: Yes. He was under arrest at that time.</p>
<p class="indent">Q: And your view coincides with the view of the investigators.</p>
<p class="indent">A: It would, yes.</p>
<p>[45] The trial judge at this point interrupted defence counsel's 
  cross-examination to remind the jury that it was their opinion that mattered, 
  not the views of Detective Inspector Lines or the police. A discussion followed 
  in the absence of the jury about this line of questioning. The trial judge ruled 
  that any linkage between the witness's opinion and the appellant as a known 
  suspect was a matter for argument only. It is in this respect that the appellant 
  submits that defence counsel's cross-examination was improperly restricted. 
  More will be said about this later. </p>
<p>
  [46] Following this discussion, defence counsel moved on to a line of questioning 
  intended to show that the staging suggested that the perpetrator did not necessarily 
  have an interest in Marsha Ottey, as the witness had testified but, rather, 
  that he had an interest in Tamara. In this respect, defence counsel questioned 
  Detective Inspector Lines about Tamara Ottey's wallet, which appeared to have 
  been moved during the staging of the crime scene, about items belonging to Marsha 
  Ottey that were not disturbed or taken, and about the fact that Marsha's bedroom 
  was no more in a state of disarray than the other rooms. Defence counsel also 
  questioned Detective Inspector Lines about perpetrators retaining items taken 
  from the crime scene and reviewed with her the fact that none of the items missing 
  from the Ottey home, which all belonged to Marsha Ottey, were found during a 
  search of the appellant's home. </p>
<p>
  [47] In re-examination, the Crown asked Detective Inspector Lines: &quot;And 
  what else is it, apart from [Marsha Ottey's] belongings if those are excluded, 
  what else is it about this crime scene that tells you that there's an interest 
  in Marsha Ottey?&quot; To which Detective Inspector Lines replied: &quot;The 
  injuries that were inflicted on her.&quot; Defence counsel immediately objected 
  to this question and answer, but was overruled by the trial judge on the basis 
  that it was the defence who had opened the area. The Crown further re-examined 
  the witness on a number of matters related to the perpetrator's identity or 
  likely motivations. I note the following by way of example: whether the fact 
  that DNA was left behind by only one person said anything on the question whether 
  that person was the only one in the house at the time of the murders; whether, 
  assuming there was more than one person at the scene at the time of the murders 
  and one left his DNA at the scene, this told the witness anything about who 
  staged the crime scene; and whether, assuming the items were taken by a person 
  having some prior association with Marsha, it would surprise the witness if 
  those items were not found in the possession of that person when his residence 
  was searched. The witness answered all these questions in the negative. With 
  respect to the latter question, she explained that &quot;due to the fact of 
  the connection with - with staging and someone's potential connection with the 
  crime, it may, in fact, be dangerous to retain such items for any period of 
  time.&quot; </p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>D. Analysis</strong></p>
<p> [48] The test for the admissibility of expert evidence is well established 
  and need not be discussed at length here. It was consolidated by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in <em>R. v. <em>Mohan</em>, supra</em>, and subsequently restated in 
  many other cases. The party seeking to introduce expert opinion evidence must 
  meet four criteria: relevance, necessity, the absence of any other exclusionary 
  rule, and a properly qualified expert. Even where these requirements are met, 
  the evidence may be rejected if its prejudicial effect on the conduct of the 
  trial outweighs its probative value: see <em>R. v. D.D.</em>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 
  275 at para. 11, 148 C.C.C. (3d) 41. The first two criteria and the assessment 
  of whether the probative value outweighs the prejudicial effect also include 
  an inquiry into the reliability of the proposed evidence. In the case of novel 
  scientific evidence, this latter inquiry is often critical.</p>
<p> [49] It is also well established that the application of the four <em>Mohan</em> criteria 
  is case-specific. McLachlin C.J.C. (dissenting but not on this point) provided 
  a useful summary of the law relating to the case-specific nature of the test 
  in R. v. D.D., supra, at paras. 12-13. She reiterated the principle that the 
  required determinations must be made within the factual context of the trial, 
  having regard to the other evidence, the issues, and the particular jury. She 
  repeated Sopinka J.'s words in<em> R. v. Morin</em>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345 at 
  para. 64, 44 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 218, that the inquiry into relevance &quot;is 
  very much a function of the other evidence and issues in a case&quot;. Similarly, 
  the trial judge is in the best position to determine what are the live issues 
  in the trial and whether the evidence will be necessary to enable the jury to 
  dispose of them. McLachlin C.J.C. stated at para. 12 that: </p>
<p class="indent"> [t]he point was well put in <em>R. v. F. (D.S.)</em> (1999), 
  43 O.R. (3d) 609 at p. 625, 132 C.C.C. (3d) 97, 169 D.L.R. (4th) 639 (C.A.): 
</p>
<p class="indent"> The trial judge has the advantage of hearing the evidence in 
  issue, observing the jury and being able to appreciate the dynamics of the particular 
  trial . . . [T]he trial judge may also be in a better position to determine 
  what may come within the normal experience of the average juror in the community 
  in which the case is being tried.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the trial judge may be in the best position to determine 
  whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial 
  effect on the trial. The trial judge knows the issues, the evidence and the 
  jury and is charged with the ultimate responsibility of running a fair trial.</p>
<p>
  [50] Hence, a trial judge's decision to admit or reject expert evidence is entitled 
  to considerable appellate deference. McLachlin C.J.C. also noted at para. 13 
  that &quot;the case-specific nature of the inquiry means that an appellate court 
  cannot lay down in advance broad rules that particular categories of expert 
  evidence are always inadmissible.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [51] Before applying the test for admissibility to the evidence in this case, 
  I will deal with the Crown's contention that the appellant is raising some of 
  the issues related to admissibility for the first time on appeal. The Crown 
  submits that the defence's objection to the evidence at trial was based solely 
  on the ground that the necessity requirement was not met and that no issue was 
  raised with respect to the reliability of the proposed evidence. Consequently, 
  the Crown argues that the appellant cannot, on an incomplete record, raise new 
  issues on appeal. </p>
<p>
  [52] I find no merit to this contention. It is correct that the main focus of 
  the defence argument was on necessity at the time the Crown first sought to 
  introduce the expert opinion evidence. However, on my review of the record, 
  it is clear that the argument was so tailored in response to the Crown's submission 
  that the evidence would be restricted to the opinion that the crime scene was 
  staged and would not include matters related to the motivations or characteristics 
  of the perpetrator. It is also apparent from the record, the salient parts of 
  which I have reviewed earlier, that the defence consistently objected during 
  the course of Detective Inspector Lines' testimony when the Crown purported 
  to present evidence that went beyond the scope as initially defined. Those later 
  objections, without question, were based on issues relating to the lack of reliability 
  and to the prejudicial effect of the evidence. As noted earlier, the scope of 
  the expert opinion evidence expanded during the course of its presentation.</p>
<p> [53] In this case it becomes important in applying the <em><em>Mohan</em></em> criteria, 
  to distinguish between, first, the expert witness's opinion that the crime scene 
  appeared staged, and, second, her various opinions on the motivations and characteristic 
  of the likely perpetrator as a person associated with the victims, in particular 
  Marsha. I will refer to the first category as &quot;crime scene evidence&quot; 
  and the second as &quot;criminal profiling.&quot; By adopting these labels, 
  I do not intend any suggestion that the question of admissibility can be determined 
  simply by categorizing the proposed evidence. As noted earlier, such an approach 
  would not be consistent with the case-specific nature of the test. I use these 
  labels mainly for convenience and also to assist in identifying the scope of 
  the expert opinion with more precision. </p>
<p>
  [54] As I will explain, I would have found no reason to interfere with the trial 
  judge's discretion to admit the expert opinion testimony in relation to the 
  crime scene evidence had it been properly restricted within that scope. However, 
  Detective Inspector Lines' testimony, from the outset, went far beyond the scope 
  of properly admissible evidence and, eventually, included evidence of criminal 
  profiling that, in my view, was clearly inadmissible. </p>
<p> [55] I will deal first with the crime scene evidence and consider the <em><em>Mohan</em></em> 
  criteria as they relate to the opinion that the crime scene was staged and then 
  I will deal with the criminal profiling evidence. </p>
<p class="indent15"> <em>1. The crime scene evidence</em></p>
<p>
  [56] As noted by the Crown at trial, the fact that the crime scene may have 
  been staged to look as if the house had been burglared is a piece of circumstantial 
  evidence that may provide some insight into the perpetrator's motivation and, 
  in turn, his or her identity. No issue has been raised with respect to the relevance 
  of this aspect of the expert evidence. Similarly, no real issue is raised with 
  respect to the reliability of the evidence on this narrow point. The reliability 
  of any opinion that a crime scene was staged would be very much a function of 
  the particular witness's experience with scenes of break and enter. Further, 
  no issue was raised with respect to Detective Inspector Lines' qualifications. 
  The real issue with respect to her staging opinion is whether it is necessary 
  to present this evidence through the mouth of an expert witness with all the 
  associated dangers that this form of evidence presents. That was the crux of 
  the defence's objection at trial. The objection is repeated on appeal. </p>
<p>
  [57] The appellant argues that expert opinion evidence on staging was not necessary. 
  He submits that there was an evidentiary basis for the jury to conclude on its 
  own that the crime scene was staged. The Crown had introduced photographs and 
  a videotape of the Ottey residence. In addition, Detective Mann, an experienced 
  forensic identification officer who had examined numerous crime scenes, including 
  hundreds of break-ins, had already testified as to many aspects of the crime 
  scene as it compared to the usual appearance of a burglared home. (I note, by 
  contrast, that Detective Inspector Lines had never been personally involved 
  in a break and enter investigation other than through the investigative support 
  services.) For example, Detective Mann had testified about what items are generally 
  attractive to burglars such as jewellery, identification documents such as passports 
  and bank cards, cameras, clock radios, VCRs, and sound equipment. He testified 
  that, in this case, a large number of such valuable and moveable items had been 
  left at the scene. Detective Mann also testified that burglars often use bags 
  or suitcases found at the crime scene to transport the stolen goods and that 
  several bags and suitcases were found in the Ottey home after the homicides. 
  Similarly, he observed that drawers had not been rifled through and that stereo 
  equipment had been moved but the wires had not been disconnected as one might 
  expect in a burglary.</p>
<p>
  [58] Hence, the appellant submits that it was not necessary to introduce additional 
  evidence in the form of expert opinion testimony in support of the argument 
  that the crime scene had been staged. It would have been open to the jury to 
  draw its own conclusion on the evidence. The Crown concedes that there may have 
  been some evidentiary foundation to suggest that the scene was staged without 
  Detective Inspector Lines' testimony. However, the Crown takes the position 
  that Detective Inspector Lines provided some additional insights into the normal 
  behaviour of burglars and certain aspects of the crime scene, without which 
  there was a significant danger that the jury would not have properly assessed 
  the issue of whether the burglary was staged. </p>
<p>
  [59] Although the appellant's argument on the issue of necessity is not without 
  merit, I am of the view that it was open to the trial judge to find that it 
  was necessary to admit some form of expert opinion on this issue. As quoted 
  earlier, the inquiry on the question of necessity &quot;is very much a function 
  of the other evidence and issues in a case.&quot; The trial judge was in a better 
  position to determine whether the subject matter was one that may come within 
  the normal experience of this jury or whether they were likely to come to a 
  wrong conclusion without expert assistance on the issue of whether the crime 
  scene was staged. </p>
<p> [60] However, the dangers associated with the reception of expert opinion 
  evidence do not disappear simply because the evidence, on its face, meets the 
  four criteria set out in <em><em>Mohan</em></em>. As noted earlier, evidence should not 
  be admitted if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. In my view, 
  the manner in which the crime scene evidence was packaged for the jury in this 
  case exemplifies the usual dangers associated with expert opinion evidence. 
  I will review some of those dangers and comment further on the presentation 
  of the crime scene evidence in this case to explain my point. </p>
<p> [61] The Supreme Court of Canada reviewed the dangers associated with expert 
  opinion evidence in <em><em>Mohan</em> </em>and more recently in <em>R. v. D.D.</em>, 
  supra. The primary danger is that the evidence may distort the fact-finding 
  process. As stated by Sopinka J. in <em><em>Mohan</em></em> (at para. 19): </p>
<p class="indent">
  Dressed up in scientific language which the jury does not easily understand 
  and submitted through a witness of impressive antecedents, this evidence is 
  apt to be accepted by the jury as being virtually infallible and as having more 
  weight than it deserves.</p>
<p>
  [62] Other significant dangers include the usual resistance of the expert opinion 
  to effective cross-examination and the reliance by the expert on out-of-court 
  material that would be otherwise inadmissible. Finally, the admission of expert 
  opinion evidence often results in significant costs in time and money to the 
  parties and strains upon judicial resources. </p>
<p>
  [63] Those dangers must be considered in the balancing process that forms part 
  of the test for admissibility. Further, the trial judge's gatekeeper function 
  does not end with the ruling on admissibility. The expert evidence must be carefully 
  constrained in its presentation with a view to minimizing the associated dangers 
  so that, in the end result, the judge is still satisfied that the probative 
  value of the evidence exceeds its prejudicial effect and is properly admissible. 
  </p>
<p>
  [64] For example, in this case, the inference that the crime scene was staged 
  was neither complex nor particularly sophisticated. While I defer to the trial 
  judge's conclusion that this inference may not have been one that could have 
  been made by the average juror without expert assistance, I am of the view that 
  it was not necessary for the Crown to dress it up, as was done in this case, 
  as a subset of the entire scope of services provided by the Behavioural Sciences 
  Section of the Ontario Provincial Police Investigative Support Bureau. The description 
  of Detective Inspector Lines' field of operation, as elicited by the Crown in 
  examination-in-chief alone, covers some 30 pages of transcript, most of which 
  was unrelated to her opinion that the crime scene was staged. This testimony 
  dealt rather with the broader field of criminal profiling, including specialized 
  training in a wide range of subject matters such as criminal harassment, drug 
  investigation techniques, advanced law enforcement, corporate management investigations, 
  enterprise crimes, micro-computers and child abuse. This lead-up to the presentation 
  of the crime scene evidence, quite apart from the additional criminal profiling 
  opinions that were elicited and which I will discuss later, did nothing to lessen 
  the dangers discussed earlier. Rather, it served to give the staging evidence 
  an omniscient glow that enhanced the likelihood that the jury would give the 
  expert opinion more weight than it deserved. </p>
<p>
  [65] Further, Detective Inspector Lines was permitted to bolster her opinion 
  that this crime scene was staged by stating that she had her opinion verified 
  by more than ten colleagues, similarly trained and experienced in this field, 
  from Ontario, Manitoba, California, Washington and Virginia who all agreed with 
  her conclusion. This hearsay evidence was clearly inadmissible. </p>
<p>
  [66] I make the following additional comment about the record in this case to 
  further explain this point on the &quot;packaging&quot; of the crime scene evidence. 
  I agree with the appellant's submission that the factual basis that would support 
  the inference that the crime scene was staged had already been admitted through 
  the testimony of the identification officer, Detective Mann. All that was missing 
  from his evidence was testimony making this specific inference. The Crown was 
  seeking to adduce such testimony through Detective Inspector Lines. Accepting 
  that this additional evidence was necessary, I query whether it might not have 
  been best to present it through Detective Mann by means of a few additional 
  questions. It seems to me that the presentation of the evidence in that form 
  would have served the same purpose without the additional dangers presented 
  by Detective Inspector Lines' testimony. I note in respect of Detective Mann's 
  qualifications that he was qualified by the court to give opinion evidence in 
  the field of forensic identification. The defence did not contest his qualifications, 
  agreeing that Detective Mann was &quot;very competent.&quot; Further, there 
  was no objection at trial, or on this appeal, in respect of the numerous opinions 
  that Detective Mann did provide about the appearance of the crime scene as it 
  compared to the usual burglary. Indeed, it would appear from his testimony that 
  he was eminently qualified to give this evidence. </p>
<p>
  [67] However, because of the manner in which the staging opinion evidence was 
  presented through Detective Inspector Lines, it is my view that the danger that 
  the jury might give the evidence more weight than it deserved far outweighed 
  its probative value. Further, the stage was set for far-reaching opinion evidence 
  on criminal profiling and, unfortunately, Detective Inspector Lines' evidence 
  did include matters that went beyond the permissible scope of admissibility. 
  This leads to the analysis of the criminal profiling evidence elicited from 
  Detective Inspector Lines. </p>
<p class="indent15"> <em>2. The criminal profiling evidence </em></p>
<p> [68] Earlier in this judgment, I defined criminal profiling as involving the 
  analysis of a crime scene and other details about a crime, in conjunction with 
  the analyst's understanding of cases of a similar nature, for the purpose of 
  inferring the motivation for the offence and producing a description of the 
  type of person likely to be responsible for its commission. This is by no means 
  the only way to describe this technique. Indeed, as noted by one English author, 
  David C. Ormerod, in his article entitled <em>The Evidential Implications of 
  Psychological Profiling</em> [1996] Crim. L.R. 863, &quot;[d]efinitional difficulties 
  stem from the fact that there is considerable theoretical disagreement about 
  approaches to profiling.&quot; He describes the process as follows at pp. 865-866: 
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The profiler begins by reconstructing how the crime occurred, on which is based 
  an inference as to why the crime happened, and culminates in an educated guess 
  about the characteristics of the offender. This WHAT to WHY to WHO is seen as 
  the nucleus of the criminal profile. Profiles incorporate many factors, including: 
  evaluations of the crime scene and neighbourhood, post-mortem reports, information 
  as to the victim's movements prior to the crime, the suspect's interaction with 
  the victim, etc. Ideally, the resulting profile should include information as 
  to the &quot;age, race, occupational level, marital status, intelligence, educational 
  level, arrest history, military history, family background, social interests, 
  socioeconomic level, residence in relation to the crime and with whom residing, 
  personality characteristics (rigid, passive, manipulative, aggressive), colour, 
  age and description of vehicle, [and] suggested interview techniques for the 
  offender [footnotes omitted].</p>
<p> [69] The author goes on to describe the various uses of criminal profiling 
  by the police as an investigative tool. The Honourable Fred Kaufman in the <em>Report 
  of the Kaufman Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy Paul Morin</em> (Toronto: 
  Queen's Printer for Ontario, 1998) also discusses the use of criminal profiling 
  as an investigative tool used to assist police in directing their investigation. 
  The integrity of the profile used in the investigation of Guy Paul Morin was 
  questioned by the Commission and the Report contains certain recommendations 
  about the use of criminal profiling by the police. These included limitations 
  on the use of criminal profiling such as the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> <span class="underline">Recommendation 110</span>: Limitations 
  upon criminal profiling</p>
<p class="indent">Police officers should be trained as to the appropriate use 
  of, and limitations upon, criminal profiling. Undue reliance upon profiling 
  can misdirect an investigation. <span class="underline">Profiling once a suspect 
  is identified can be misleading and dangerous, as the investigators' summary 
  of relevant facts may be coloured by their suspicions</span>. A profile may 
  generate ideas for further investigation and, to that extent, it can be an investigative 
  tool. But it is no substitute for a full and complete investigation, untainted 
  by preconceptions or stereotypical thinking [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [70] Accepting that criminal profiling may be a useful, <em>albeit</em> potentially 
  dangerous, aid to police investigations, its use as a means of proof in a courtroom 
  is quite another matter. It becomes important to distinguish between matters 
  related to the description and analysis of a crime scene, the &quot;WHAT&quot; 
  referred to in Ormerod's article, and matters related to the motivation or characteristics 
  of the offender, the &quot;WHY&quot; or the &quot;WHO&quot;. All aspects of 
  expert opinion testimony of course must meet the same test for admissibility 
  and I am not suggesting that the simple characterization of the evidence answers 
  the question on admissibility. I am simply observing that expert opinion testimony 
  about &quot;WHY&quot; or &quot;WHO&quot; usually raises more concerns. These 
  concerns relate most frequently to two aspects of the <em><em>Mohan</em></em> test for 
  admissibility: the requirement that the evidence be sufficiently reliable to 
  warrant its admission and the requirement that its probative value exceed its 
  prejudicial effect. I note the following examples to explain the difference. 
</p>
<p>
  [71] Crime scene analysis (which I find useful to label as the &quot;WHAT&quot; 
  referred to earlier) results in many forms of expert opinion evidence that regularly 
  meets the legal requirements for admissibility. A few examples readily come 
  to mind: an expert's opinion in an arson case that a fire was not accidental 
  but, rather, deliberately set; opinion evidence explaining the significance 
  of blood splatters; a pathologist's opinion about the likely cause of death 
  or of injuries observed on a deceased victim; an expert's opinion on how a motor 
  vehicle accident happened. There are many more examples. This kind of evidence 
  assists the trier of fact in understanding WHAT the crime scene shows. The admissibility 
  of that kind of evidence will usually turn on questions of relevance or the 
  witness's particular expertise. Of course, issues may also arise under any other 
  aspect of the <em>Mohan</em> test. However, the scientific basis for this kind of evidence 
  is usually not contentious. </p>
<p>
  [72] By contrast, attempts to adduce expert opinion evidence about WHY an offence 
  was committed in a particular manner and, more particularly, about WHO is more 
  likely to have committed the offence, that is, the kinds of evidence that I 
  have labelled more particularly as criminal profiling, have generally not met 
  with success, either in this jurisdiction or elsewhere. I will refer to some 
  American and English jurisprudence later in this judgment. However, in so far 
  as Canadian jurisprudence is concerned, the best example is <em>Mohan</em> itself.</p>
<p> [73] In <em>Mohan</em>, the accused was a pediatrician charged with four counts 
  of sexual assault on four female patients between the ages of 13 and 16. Counsel 
  for the accused sought to call a psychiatrist to testify that, in his opinion, 
  the perpetrator of the alleged assaults was a member of a limited and unusual 
  group of persons, and that the accused's characteristics excluded him from that 
  group. On a<em> <em>voir dire</em></em> to determine the admissibility of the evidence, 
  the psychiatrist described certain general psychosexual profiles, including 
  those of pedophiles and sexual psychopaths, and explained that persons matching 
  these profiles were members of unusual and limited classes. He then gave his 
  opinion on the psychosexual profile of the perpetrator of each of the alleged 
  assaults. It was also envisaged that his testimony would include his opinion 
  that the accused did not have &quot;the characteristics attributable to any 
  of the three groups in which most sex offenders fall.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [74] The trial judge excluded this evidence, and the Supreme Court of Canada 
  held that he had been correct to do so. Sopinka J. set out the four criteria 
  mentioned above for determining the admissibility of expert evidence. In particular, 
  he observed at para. 28 that expert evidence that is based on novel science 
  will require &quot;special scrutiny to determine whether it meets a basic threshold 
  of reliability&quot; and necessity. He added the following caution: &quot;The 
  closer the evidence approaches an opinion on an ultimate issue, the stricter 
  the application of this principle.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [75] Turning specifically to expert evidence relating to an accused's disposition, 
  Sopinka J. held that for such evidence to be admissible, there must first be 
  something distinctive about the behavioural characteristics of either the accused 
  or the perpetrator that makes a comparison of the two sets of characteristics 
  helpful in determining innocence or guilt. He then explained (at para. 45) that 
  in making this determination, the trial judge must evaluate the scientific reliability 
  of the expert's opinion as to the behavioural characteristics of the perpetrator: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The trial judge should consider the opinion of the expert and whether the expert 
  is merely expressing a personal opinion or whether the behavioural profile which 
  the expert is putting forward is in common use as a reliable indicator of membership 
  in a distinctive group. Put another way: Has the scientific community developed 
  a standard profile for the offender who commits this type of crime? An affirmative 
  finding on this basis will satisfy the criteria of relevance and necessity.</p>
<p>
  [76] Sopinka J. ultimately concluded at para. 46 that the psychiatrist's evidence 
  did not meet the required threshold of reliability: </p>
<p class="indent"> [T]here was no material in the record to support a finding 
  that the profile of a pedophile or psychopath has been standardized to the extent 
  that it could be said that it matched the supposed profile of the offender depicted 
  in the charges. The expert's group profiles were not seen as sufficiently reliable 
  to be considered helpful. In the absence of these <em>indicia</em> of reliability, 
  it cannot be said that the evidence would be necessary in the sense of usefully 
  clarifying a matter otherwise unaccessible, or that any value it may have had 
  would not be outweighed by its potential for misleading or diverting the jury.</p>
<p> [77] The Supreme Court of Canada considered criminal profiling evidence again 
  in <em>R. v. J.-L.J.</em>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 600, 148 C.C.C. (3d) 487. As in <em>Mohan</em>, 
  the accused in <em>J.-L.J.</em> sought to adduce the evidence of an expert psychiatrist, 
  who was of the opinion that the perpetrator of the offences in question had 
  a highly distinct personality disorder, and that the accused did not exhibit 
  the traits of someone with that disorder. The evidence was held to be insufficiently 
  reliable to warrant admission. The Court emphasized that a profile must be to 
  some degree or another &quot;standardized&quot; if it is to be at all useful 
  for the purpose of demonstrating the distinctiveness of the perpetrator. As 
  Binnie J. states at para. 44: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The requirement of a &quot;standard profile&quot; is to ensure that the profile 
  of distinctive features is not put together on an ad hoc basis for the purpose 
  of the particular case. </p>
<p> [78] The Crown in its factum characterizes Detective Inspector Lines' testimony 
  as &quot;opinion about the motivation of staging behaviour.&quot; However, as 
  noted in the excerpts from her evidence described earlier, her opinion on WHY 
  a perpetrator would employ staging (&quot;to redirect the investigation away 
  <em>from the most logical suspect</em>&quot;) included and extended to WHO that 
  person would be (<em>&quot;almost always someone who had some kind of association 
  or relationship with the victim.&quot;</em>). The Crown states further in its 
  factum that this type of expert evidence has been accepted in Canada and the 
  United States and, in support of this argument, cites the following cases: <em>R. 
  v. Clark</em>, [1998] O.J. No. 5590 (Gen. Div.); <em>R. v. Klymchuk</em> (2000), 
  155 C.C.C. (3d) 423 (Ont. S.C.J.); <em>New York v. McDonald</em>, 231 A.D.2d 
  647 (1996); <em>California v. Singh</em>, 37 Cal. App. 4th 1343 (1995); and 
  <em>USA v. Yost</em>, 24 F.3d 99 (10th Cir. 1994). </p>
<p> [79] The rulings in <em>Clark and Klymchuk</em> were made in the course of 
  trials that have now been completed. An appeal from the resulting conviction 
  in each case is pending before this court. I do not propose to comment on either 
  case. I do wish to note, however, that the American cases relied upon by the 
  Crown did not go so far as to admit criminal profiling evidence. The expert 
  opinion evidence introduced in those three cases was limited, rather, to the 
  opinion that the crime scene had been staged. In any event, it is important 
  to note that, while the American authorities can provide assistance, the comparable 
  rule regarding the admission of expert evidence, although similar, is not the 
  same as that articulated in <em>Mohan</em>.</p>
<p> [80] The English Court of Appeal recently had the opportunity to consider 
  the admissibility of a related kind of evidence in <em>R. v. Gilfoyle</em>, 
  [2001] 2 Cr. App. Rep. 57. In <em>Gilfoyle</em>, the accused, who was charged 
  with the murder of his wife, sought to admit fresh evidence before the Court 
  of Appeal from a psychologist who had conducted a &quot;psychological autopsy&quot; 
  of the deceased. Based on his examination of some of the evidence, including 
  the deceased's diary, other documents written by her, and various post-mortem 
  reports by a psychiatrist and a pathologist, the psychologist formed the opinion 
  that the evidence strongly supported a conclusion that the deceased had taken 
  her own life. </p>
<p>
  [81] The Court of Appeal ruled that the psychologist's opinion was inadmissible 
  as a matter of law for a number of reasons, including that there was no identifiable 
  way to test the reliability of his testimony: &quot;there is no data base comparing 
  real and questionable suicides and there is no substantial body of academic 
  writing approving his methodology.&quot; The Court made the following comment 
  that is apposite to the evidence in question on this appeal (at p. 68): </p>
<p class="indent">
  [Defence counsel] accepted that, if evidence of this kind were admissible in 
  relation to the deceased, there could be no difference in principle in relation 
  to evidence psychologically profiling a defendant. In our judgment, the roads 
  of enquiry thus opened up would be unending and of little or no help to a jury. 
  The use of psychological profiling as an aid to police investigation is one 
  thing, but its use as a means of proof in court is another.</p>
<p>
  [82] In this case, Detective Inspector Lines' opinions about the perpetrator's 
  likely motivation for staging the crime scene and his characteristics as a person 
  associated with the victims and having a particular interest in Marsha constituted 
  evidence of criminal profiling. Criminal profiling is a novel field of scientific 
  evidence, the reliability of which was not demonstrated at trial. To the contrary, 
  it would appear from her limited testimony about the available verification 
  of opinions in her field of work that her opinions amounted to no more than 
  educated guesses. As such, her criminal profiling evidence was inadmissible. 
  The criminal profiling evidence also approached the ultimate issue in this case 
  and, hence, was highly prejudicial. The prejudice was further heightened by 
  the limits placed on defence counsel's cross-examination and by the prominence 
  that the trial judge gave to Detective Inspector Lines' evidence in his charge. 
  This brings me to the additional grounds of appeal with respect to this evidence. 
  In light of my conclusion on the issue of admissibility, my comments on these 
  additional grounds will be brief. </p>
<p class="indent15"> <em>3. The limits on cross-examination</em></p>
<p> [83] As noted earlier, the trial judge refused to permit defence counsel to 
  cross-examine Detective Inspector Lines about the possibility that her conclusions 
  were influenced by her involvement with the police investigators and by their 
  belief that the appellant was involved in the crime. The trial judge was of 
  the view that the investigators' belief in the guilt of the appellant was irrelevant 
  and that this was a matter of argument and not cross-examination. The appellant 
  submits that the trial judge erred in his ruling. In support of his contention, 
  he refers to the recommendation from the <em>Kaufman</em> inquiry, referred 
  to earlier, that &quot;profiling once a suspect has been identified can be misleading 
  and dangerous, as the investigators' summary of relevant facts may be coloured 
  by their suspicions.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [84] I agree with the appellant's position on this point. The line of cross-examination 
  was highly relevant and should have been permitted.</p>
<p class="indent"> <em>4. The trial judge's charge to the jury</em></p>
<p>
  [85] The appellant raises several concerns about the trial judge's instructions 
  to the jury on what use they could make of Detective Inspector Lines' testimony. 
  In light of my conclusion that her evidence, at least in part, was inadmissible, 
  I do not find it necessary to deal with the concerns that were raised. It is 
  important to note, however, in relation to this ground of appeal that Detective 
  Inspector Lines' evidence figured prominently in the trial judge's charge to 
  the jury. After reviewing her evidence, the trial judge instructed the jury 
  that this evidence &quot;may be important should you find that Rohan Ranger 
  had a motive to kill Marsha Ottey and would have been considered as an obvious 
  suspect. It may also be important should you find as a fact that Adrian Kinkead 
  had no motive to kill either Ottey sister and therefore was at 88 Valley Road 
  only at the behest of his cousin, Rohan Ranger. Kinkead would have had no need 
  to divert suspicion from himself.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [86] The trial judge also referred to the staging evidence on four occasions 
  while reviewing the Crown's theory for the jury, pointing out that it was the 
  Crown's position that the appellant staged the crime scene in order to divert 
  suspicion from himself as the most obvious or likely suspect and that Adrian 
  Kinkead, who was not an obvious suspect, would not have needed to stage the 
  scene if he was the sole perpetrator. </p>
<p>
  [87] The trial judge last referred the jury to the staging evidence almost at 
  the very end of his charge, in the context of his instructions about how the 
  jury should approach the evidence. This part of the charge will be discussed 
  in further detail later in this judgment. Of significance in relation to this 
  ground of appeal is the fact that the staging evidence was mentioned specifically 
  in relation to the jury's ultimate determination of the verdict. </p>
<p> [88] The trial judge instructed the jury that finding that the appellant was 
  in or about the Ottey home around the time of the killings &quot;will be a giant 
  step towards your being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused 
  unlawfully participated in the killings of the Ottey sisters&quot;. He further 
  instructed them that &quot;in making that determination, you must assess the 
  evidence cumulatively and not in piecemeal fashion. Thus the evidence of Victor 
  Lo must not be assessed in isolation but must be weighed together with all the 
  evidence; including the evidence of motive, association death threats, <em>staging</em> 
  and any other evidence you find relevant to this determination [emphasis added]&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [89] The trial judge further instructed the jury that even if they were not 
  satisfied that the appellant was in or about the Ottey home at the relevant 
  time, they could still find the appellant guilty as an aider and abettor, but 
  that it was &quot;critical&quot; in this situation that they find as a fact 
  that the appellant had the sole motive to kill Marsha Ottey and &quot;that Adrian 
  Kinkead had no motive to kill either Ottey sister and that a false break and 
  enter was staged to divert suspicion from Marsha Ottey's ex-boyfriend.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [90] In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the failure to properly 
  circumscribe the expert opinion evidence on this issue occasioned no harm. For 
  these reasons, I would give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p> <strong>IV. AFTER-THE-FACT CONDUCT: THE JAMAICA EVIDENCE</strong></p>
<p>
  [91] In January 1996, the appellant and his father flew to Jamaica with tickets 
  for a one-week round trip. The father returned to Canada a week later but the 
  appellant did not. In February 1996, the police arrested Mr. Kinkead and issued 
  a warrant for the appellant's arrest on charges of murdering Marsha and Tamara 
  Ottey. The appellant agreed to return voluntarily to Canada and to surrender 
  to the police in connection with these charges. </p>
<p>
  [92] Over the objections of defence counsel, the trial judge permitted the Crown 
  to introduce evidence about the appellant's trip to Jamaica and his overstay 
  as evidence of flight from which the jury could infer consciousness of guilt. 
  The Crown argued that, at the time the appellant left Canada in January 1996, 
  the police had begun to investigate Adrian Kinkead in connection with the deaths 
  of Marsha and Tamara Ottey and, although it could not be proven, it was possible 
  that the appellant had come to know that and that this knowledge was what had 
  precipitated his departure. The trial judge also permitted the Crown to introduce 
  evidence of the hostile climate of the populace in Jamaica to rebut the possible 
  defence argument that the appellant's surrender to the police and return to 
  Canada one month later was voluntary. The trial judge later reversed his ruling 
  and ultimately told the jury to disregard this evidence on the issue of consciousness 
  of guilt. </p>
<p>
  [93] The appellant argues that the Jamaica evidence was of no probative value, 
  highly prejudicial and, consequently, inadmissible. He submits that the prejudicial 
  effect of the evidence was aggravated by the Crown's use of this evidence in 
  closing submissions to the jury. Finally, he argues that the instructions to 
  the jury were insufficient to remedy the error. </p>
<p>
  [94] In response to this ground of appeal, the Crown reiterates its position 
  at trial that the Jamaica evidence is evidence of flight, showing that the appellant 
  left Canada once the police began to investigate Adrian Kinkead more seriously 
  in connection with the deaths of Marsha and Tamara Ottey, and also showing that 
  the appellant did not decide to return to Canada until he became concerned about 
  his personal safety in Jamaica.</p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>A. The Jamaica evidence</strong></p>
<p>
  [95] Little evidence was called in relation to the plans for the trip to Jamaica 
  other than the testimony of the travel agent who had booked the trip for the 
  appellant and his father. Most of the evidence about the trip to Jamaica related 
  to the circumstances surrounding the appellant's return to Canada. </p>
<p>
  [96] In this respect, the Crown introduced evidence about discussions relating 
  to the appellant's return to Canada between the appellant's lawyer at the time 
  (who was not defence counsel at trial) and Detective Mendelson, one of the police 
  officers involved in the Ottey investigation. Detective Mendelson testified 
  that two days after the police arrested Adrian Kinkead, and a couple of hours 
  before the police were to hold a press conference announcing the issuance of 
  a warrant for the appellant's arrest for the Ottey murders, he received a voice-mail 
  message from the appellant's lawyer stating that the lawyer would be meeting 
  the appellant's father later that day. The police officer returned the call, 
  and told the lawyer about the press conference. The lawyer said he did not have 
  instructions yet to disclose the appellant's whereabouts, but would call again 
  in two days. </p>
<p>
  [97] Two days later, the lawyer called Detective Mendelson. Detective Mendelson 
  testified that the lawyer told him in this second telephone conversation that 
  the appellant was in Jamaica but wanted to return to Toronto voluntarily and 
  surrender. Detective Mendelson also testified that the lawyer told him that 
  the appellant was concerned for his personal safety in Jamaica. </p>
<p>
  [98] Arrangements were made for the police and a defence counsel to fly to Jamaica. 
  The plan was for the appellant to return voluntarily to Toronto with the police 
  and defence counsel, and for the appellant to be arrested once he was on Canadian 
  soil. By the time the police and defence counsel arrived in Jamaica, news of 
  the warrant for the appellant's arrest was already circulating. It appears that 
  the deaths of Marsha and Tamara Ottey received attention in Jamaica because 
  the Otteys' extended family is well-known there. As it turned out, the appellant 
  was already in the custody of the Jamaican police who, for the appellant's own 
  protection, detained him overnight in an office located in a local police station 
  until he was turned over to the Toronto police. Detective Mendelson, defence 
  counsel, and the appellant then flew back to Toronto, where the appellant was 
  immediately arrested.</p>
<p>
  [99] Detective Mendelson also testified about the public anger towards the appellant 
  in Jamaica. He described walking by a courtyard at the Jamaican police station 
  that housed a makeshift prison cell, and hearing shouts by some of the prisoners, 
  directed at him but in relation to the appellant. Detective Mendelson quoted 
  the following: &quot;Hey, Mr. Canada, bring us the Ranger boy. We kill him. 
  Bring us the fuck, and he drink jail water [explained as meaning urine]&#133;. 
  We kill the fuck, Mr. Canada.&quot; One voice shouted: &quot;I avenge the Otteys&quot; 
  and then there was a chorus of &quot;Bring us the Ranger fuck.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [100] Detective Mendelson also described the airport departure area in Jamaica 
  when the appellant was scheduled to leave. A group of 300 to 400 people, who 
  were visibly antagonistic toward the appellant, attended the airport when the 
  appellant was scheduled to leave. Detective Mendelson testified that some were 
  shouting but that he could not make out what they were saying other than hearing 
  &quot;shame&quot; a lot and &quot;shame on you&quot; and &quot;you shamed Jamaica.&quot; 
  Detective Mendelson had the departure area blocked off because of concerns for 
  their safety. </p>
<p>
  [101] After Detective Mendelson finished describing the events at the police 
  station and at the airport in Jamaica, the trial judge immediately gave the 
  following instruction to the jury: </p>
<p class="indent">
  All right. Let me give you this instruction. Whatever various members of the 
  Jamaican populace expressed in emotional terms toward Mr. Ranger has nothing 
  to do with the issue of whether Mr. Ranger either killed or participated in 
  the killing of the Ottey sisters. It is relevant only to, and I repeat, it is 
  relevant only to the issue of whether Mr. Ranger surrendered voluntarily to 
  the Toronto Police or whether Mr. Ranger surrendered because of the general 
  hostility of various members of the Jamaican populace toward him.</p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>B. Crown's closing submissions regarding the Jamaica 
  evidence</strong></p>
<p>
  [102] As noted by the appellant, the Crown placed much emphasis on this evidence 
  during the course of his final address to the jury. The Crown asked the jury 
  to draw three main inferences from the Jamaica evidence, the gist of which can 
  be described as follows: that the appellant left for Jamaica in a hurry at a 
  time when it could easily have come to his attention that the police investigation 
  into the deaths of the Ottey sisters was continuing; that the appellant's father 
  was aware of a connection between his son and Adrian Kinkead in regard to the 
  deaths of the Ottey sisters and that this led the father to call the lawyer 
  as soon as Adrian Kinkead was arrested; and that the appellant agreed to surrender 
  to the Toronto police only because &quot;the reality in Jamaica was even more 
  daunting and frightening than the reality of being arrested here in Toronto 
  for murder.&quot; </p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>C. Trial judge's instructions to the jury regarding 
  the Jamaica evidence</strong></p>
<p>
  [103] After both counsel had completed their closing addresses to the jury, 
  the trial judge, on his own motion and contrary to his earlier ruling, advised 
  counsel of his intention to tell the jury &quot;to disregard the Jamaica evidence 
  as far as consciousness of guilt.&quot; The trial judge then raised the Jamaica 
  evidence with the jury on three separate occasions during the course of his 
  charge. </p>
<p> [104] The first time was during the course of his general instructions on 
  after-the-fact conduct. The trial judge first cautioned the jury that &quot;the 
  doctrine of consciousness of guilt is inappropriately titled and should properly 
  be titled consciousness or awareness of fault&quot;. This caution was presumably 
  given in an attempt to comply with <em>R. v. Peavoy</em> (1997), 117 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 226 (Ont. C.A.) and<em> R. v. White</em>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72, 125 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 385, where the use of a more neutral label such as &quot;post-offence conduct&quot; 
  was held to be preferable. The trial judge listed five items of circumstantial 
  evidence relied on by the Crown &quot;to establish consciousness of fault.&quot; 
  The fifth item listed was the &quot;flight to Jamaica and a voluntary surrender 
  there to Toronto Police.&quot; (The fourth item to which I will refer to later 
  was &quot;an attempt to create a false alibi&quot;.) The trial judge did not 
  instruct the jury at this point to disregard any part of this evidence. Rather, 
  he continued at some length to give general instructions on the use of this 
  kind of circumstantial evidence. </p>
<p>
  [105] The second time was after these general instructions on &quot;consciousness 
  of fault&quot;, when the trial judge commented specifically on two of the five 
  items of circumstantial evidence relied on by the Crown as evidence of consciousness 
  of guilt. The trial judge stated the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> Let me address the issue of an attempted false alibi. The accused 
  is not relying on the defence of alibi. Thus you must disregard the Crown's 
  reference to a possible false alibi. Simply disregard it. </p>
<p class="indent">Let me then address the matter of Jamaica. When the accused 
  left for Jamaica, there was no warrant for arrest or no warrant imminent for 
  his arrest. He had a legal right to go to Jamaica. As for possible and voluntary 
  surrender, he was under no obligation in a foreign country to surrender to Canadian 
  police. Had he insisted on extradition proceedings, that would have been his 
  legal right. You must also disregard this evidence as to the issue of consciousness 
  of guilt.</p>
<p>
  [106] Again, I will deal with the question of the attempted false alibi later.</p>
<p>
  [107] Notwithstanding this instruction to disregard the Jamaica evidence on 
  the issue of consciousness of guilt, the trial judge, during his final review 
  of the Crown's theory towards the end of his charge, referred to this evidence 
  a third time, without telling the jury to disregard it. He stated the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Crown submits that Ranger's after-the-fact conduct is relevant 
  to show that he had a guilty conscience. His conduct indicates that he was aware 
  that he had unlawfully participated in the killing of the Ottey sisters. His 
  sudden rupture of his association with his inseparable cousin, his use of pay 
  phones, his surveillance consciousness, his walks in the parks and open space 
  and <em>his trip to Jamaica</em> all reflect consciousness of guilt [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>D. Analysis</strong></p>
<p>
  [108] In my view, the Jamaica evidence was of no probative value and highly 
  prejudicial to the appellant. In light of the trial judge's later ruling, I 
  do not need to explain why, on this record, the evidence was not probative of 
  flight and should not have been admitted at trial on that basis. </p>
<p>
  [109] I agree with the appellant's submission that the jury might have inferred 
  guilt from the highly speculative evidence of the appellant's lawyer's discussions 
  with Detective Mendelson, particularly the suggestion that the father had contacted 
  the lawyer immediately after Adrian Kinkead's arrest because, as the Crown put 
  it, &quot;everybody seems to know of a connection between [the appellant] and 
  Adrian Kinkead in terms of the murders of these two young women.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [110] I am also of the view that the evidence of the public animosity towards 
  the appellant in Jamaica was highly inflammatory and suggested that anyone who 
  knew anything about the appellant knew that he was responsible for the deaths 
  of the Ottey sisters. This aspect of the evidence was also of no probative value. 
  The appellant aptly puts it in his factum as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is hard to understand how evidence that local citizens and inmates were shouting 
  at the appellant, after he was taken into custody by the Jamaican authorities, 
  supported the appellant's purported earlier concern about his safety when no 
  one apparently knew that he was in Jamaica until the appellant contacted the 
  police and advised them of his whereabouts. </p>
<p>
  [111] The trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to call the Jamaica evidence 
  in the first place. Having allowed the evidence in, the trial judge then erred 
  in his instructions to the jury regarding this evidence. Although the trial 
  judge instructed the jury to disregard the Jamaica evidence &quot;in regard 
  to consciousness of fault&quot;, he failed to instruct them that they should 
  not consider this evidence at all. Further, having taken the evidence away from 
  their consideration, on the issue of consciousness of guilt at least, the trial 
  judge nonetheless brought the evidence back for the jury's consideration when 
  he later reviewed the Crown's overall position one last time.</p>
<p>
  [112] For these reasons, I would give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p> <strong>V. AFTER-THE-FACT CONDUCT: THE ALLEGED FALSE ALIBI</strong></p>
<p>
  [113] The appellant relies on the fact that he and a friend, Ricardo Bernardo, 
  were captured on a security video at the Scarborough Town Centre at 8:08 on 
  the morning of the homicides as compelling evidence of innocence. The appellant's 
  position at trial was that the Scarborough Town Centre evidence established 
  that there was an exceptionally small, if not non-existent, window of opportunity 
  for him to have killed or helped to kill Marsha and Tamara Ottey. Taking the 
  evidence at its highest, the appellant would have had between 16 and 26 minutes 
  to enter the Ottey house, kill each sister by stabbing them numerous times, 
  find the personal items of Marsha that were taken, ransack the house, clean 
  himself up from the stabbings, drive to the Scarborough Town Centre, park his 
  car, and make his way to the food court, where he was captured on a security 
  videotape. </p>
<p>
  [114] The appellant contends that Crown counsel greatly undermined the significance 
  of the Scarborough Town Centre evidence by referring to it in his jury submissions 
  as evidence of a false alibi, and that the trial judge erred in his charge to 
  the jury by failing to correct the damage resulting from the Crown's speculative 
  theory of false alibi. In response, the Crown argues that the trial judge properly 
  instructed the jury to disregard the Crown's reference to a possible false alibi. 
  </p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>A. Crown's closing submissions regarding the Scarborough 
  Town evidence</strong></p>
<p>
  [115] The Crown's closing submissions to the jury regarding the Scarborough 
  Town Centre evidence were extensive, covering 20 pages of transcript. During 
  these submissions, the Crown argued that the appellant had deliberately created 
  a false alibi by going to the Scarborough Town Centre minutes after the murders 
  precisely for the sole purpose of being captured on a security video, stating 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> &#133; [O]ne of the things that people do when they commit 
  murder is they make efforts to ensure that they don't get caught. Well, what's 
  one of the ways that you don't get caught? One of the ways you don't get caught 
  or think you're not going to get caught is if you don't leave any physical traces 
  behind. &#133; [B]ut as well as that, it's a very nice thing if you can create 
  an alibi for yourself, so think about it. If you've just come from committing 
  two grievous, awful, gruesome murders and you want to ensure that nobody is 
  going to hold you accountable for them, what better way to give yourself some 
  assurance than to be some place with another person who can vouch for you being 
  there and if you think about it, what better place than a place where there's 
  a camera? &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; So think about the Scarborough Town Centre. What are 
  these guys doing there at that hour of the morning? &#133; He's getting on camera, 
  ladies and gentlemen. He's getting on camera. He's creating an alibi for himself 
  or trying. Well, but what is Mr. Bernardo doing going towards the bank of phones 
  you ask? Well, consider this for a moment. You heard from Mr. Rolland that there's 
  really nothing open in that food court, as I recollect his evidence, at that 
  time of the day, and the only people in there are these mall walkers or whatever 
  they were called and so on, but there's nothing really to do in there except 
  to use the phone. Well, if you wanted to use a phone, but you had no other reason 
  to be there, why would you go to Scarborough Town Centre where the evidence 
  is that you have to go past a security guard &#133; and get permission to go 
  in there &#133;? Why would you bother? &#133; [T]hey're getting on camera and 
  creating this alibi or what they hope will suffice as an alibi &#133;</p>
<p>
  [116] The Crown also argued that the jury could look to the Scarborough Town 
  Centre evidence as providing an incriminating reason about why the appellant 
  and his friend wanted to use a telephone that early in the morning: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; Why do they want to make a phone call? Because they want to phone 88 
  Valley Stream and they want to see - remember all that evidence about what happens 
  when the phone's off the hook and when it goes to voice mail and how many rings 
  you get and so on? Well, ladies and gentlemen, what better way, if you've been 
  in this premise at 88 Valley Stream and if you've committed two gruesome murders 
  and if Mr. Rohan Ranger thinks, well, I've been seen by this same pesky guy 
  who goes walking by two days in a row, he keeps staring at me and, you know, 
  you've been seen by at least that person and possibly others and Mr. Kinkead 
  knows that he's been seen by Dwight Powrie &#133; what better way to see whether 
  your efforts in the basement of 88 Valley Stream have been discovered than to 
  leave the phone off the hook and phone back there at a later time because if 
  you phone back there and all you get is an immediate ring cum voice mail, then 
  you know that the phone is off the hook where you left it. &#133;</p>
<p>
  [117] The Crown reinforced these submissions by alerting the jury to the fact 
  that the Crown had admitted the fact that the appellant was at the Scarborough 
  Town Centre: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The other thing you should understand about admissions is that the defence can 
  only make an admission if the Crown lets it make an admission, so in order for 
  an admission to be put before you and be established as a fact, it requires 
  the consent of the Crown. Well, the Crown consented here, so now it's a fact 
  before you that you must take account of that Mr. Bernard together with Mr. 
  Ranger were at the Scarborough Town Centre at about 8:08 in the morning of the 
  16th of August of '95.</p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>B. Trial judge's instructions to the jury regarding 
  the Scarborough Town Centre evidence </strong></p>
<p>
  [118] The trial judge referred to the Scarborough Town Centre evidence, in identical 
  terms, in the course of reviewing the defence's position for the jury at the 
  beginning and again towards the end of his charge, stating each time as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The defence then asks you to look at the time available for the killings. It 
  is undisputed that the accused, Ranger, was at the Scarborough Town Centre at 
  around 8:08 a.m. on the morning of Wednesday, August 16, 1995. Thus the window 
  of opportunity for the accused, Rohan Ranger, to have participated in the Ottey 
  killings would have been only perhaps fifteen to twenty minutes. Ranger would 
  have had to have left the Ottey home by 7:50 a.m. at the latest in order to 
  have arrived at the Scarborough Town Centre by 8:08 a.m. By definition, a person 
  cannot be in two places at the same time. Thus the window for the Crown to put 
  the accused at the scene is very limited in time.</p>
<p>
  [119] The trial judge referred to the Crown's false alibi theory on two occasions 
  during his charge to the jury. As mentioned earlier, when the trial judge listed 
  the five items of circumstantial evidence relied on by the Crown &quot;to establish 
  consciousness of fault&quot;, the fourth item listed was &quot;an attempt to 
  create a false alibi&quot;. The trial judge then specifically said the following 
  about the issue of attempted false alibi: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Let me address the issue of an attempted false alibi. The accused is not relying 
  on the defence of alibi. Thus you must disregard the Crown's reference to a 
  possible false alibi. Simply disregard it. </p>
<p>
  [120] Finally, when reviewing the Crown's position almost at the conclusion 
  of his charge to the jury, the trial judge reminded the jury that the Scarborough 
  Town Centre evidence constituted &quot;evidence of opportunity, not evidence 
  of alibi&quot;. The trial judge also referred again to the Crown's theory of 
  false alibi, notwithstanding his earlier instruction to the jury to disregard 
  this theory. The trial judge stated as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Had Ranger left the Ottey home by 7:45, he would unquestionably 
  have been at the Scarborough Town Centre by 8:08 a.m., some twenty-three minutes 
  later. Ranger knew that there was a video camera that photographed Bernard and 
  himself. <em>This was the construction of a false alibi.</em> Bernard phoned 
  the house to see if the murders had been discovered [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>C. Analysis</strong></p>
<p>
  [121] An attempt by an accused to create a false alibi can constitute an affirmative 
  piece of circumstantial evidence against him or her. However, a jury cannot 
  be so instructed unless there is evidence capable of supporting a finding of 
  fabrication. In this case, there is no dispute that there was no evidence to 
  support the Crown's theory that the appellant had deliberately sought to get 
  himself filmed on the security video in order to create a false alibi. Hence, 
  there was no basis for Crown counsel to suggest in his closing submissions that 
  this alleged attempt to create a false alibi could be considered by the jury 
  as evidence against the accused. This suggestion was highly prejudicial because 
  of the importance of the Scarborough Town Centre evidence to the defence. This 
  evidence provided a basis on which the jury could conclude that the appellant 
  did not have a reasonable opportunity to kill the Ottey sisters as contended. 
  Hence, in this context, I agree with the appellant's submission that the exculpatory 
  value of the Scarborough Town Centre evidence was significantly undermined by 
  the Crown's speculation of false alibi. </p>
<p> [122] In my view, the trial judge's instructions to the jury did not remove 
  the prejudice created by the Crown's submissions. Rather, they served to exacerbate 
  the problem. First, it was an error for the trial judge to repeatedly refer 
  to the &quot;false alibi&quot; as one item of evidence relied upon by the Crown 
  to establish its case. Second, the instruction that the jury was to &quot;disregard 
  the Crown's reference to a possible false alibi&quot; because &quot;the accused 
  is not <em>relying on the defence of alibi</em>&quot; further undermined any 
  exculpatory value of the Scarborough Town Centre evidence. Rather, the jury 
  should have been told that the reason that they must disregard this reference 
  was because there was no evidence to support the Crown's theory of an attempt 
  to create a false alibi. </p>
<p>
  [123] Although the matter is of less significance, I also agree with the appellant 
  that the trial judge should have specifically instructed the jury that there 
  was no evidence to support the Crown's speculation that the appellant wanted 
  to phone the Ottey home to see if the phone was still off the hook. </p>
<p>
  [124] For these reasons, I would give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p> <strong>VI. THEORIES OF LIABILITY</strong> </p>
<p>
  [125] The Crown at trial relied on two alternative theories of how the appellant 
  participated in the murders: either the appellant killed both Ottey sisters 
  himself, with the help of Adrian Kinkead; or Adrian Kinkead killed one or both 
  sisters, with the appellant's assistance. It is clear from the Crown's conduct 
  of its case throughout the trial that either Crown theory depended on the jury 
  being satisfied that the appellant was present in the Ottey home when Marsha 
  and Tamara Ottey were killed. For example, the Crown called evidence to establish 
  that two black men were seen outside the Ottey home on August 16, 1995 around 
  7:30 a.m., shortly before the time of the deaths. The Crown also led evidence 
  that the Ottey home had been ransacked to look like a burglary and submitted 
  to the jury that two people could easily have accomplished this ransacking within 
  a short period. Similarly, the Crown's position was that the nature of the killings 
  suggested two perpetrators. Marsha and Tamara Ottey were young, strong, and 
  athletic. The Crown's theory was that the Ottey sisters could not have been 
  stabbed at the same time so viciously by only one person; rather, there must 
  have been two perpetrators, with one perpetrator restraining one of the sisters 
  while the other stabbed the other sister. As well, the Crown never suggested 
  to Adrian Kinkead during his testimony that Mr. Kinkead was by himself in the 
  Ottey home when Marsha and Tamara were killed. </p>
<p>
  [126] The appellant's position at trial was that Adrian Kinkead was the sole 
  killer and that he was not present in the Ottey home when Marsha and Tamara 
  Ottey were killed. As discussed in the previous section, the defence relied 
  heavily on the Scarborough Town Centre evidence, which placed him away from 
  the scene of the crime minutes after Marsha and Tamara Ottey were killed. The 
  appellant refers to the Scarborough Town Centre evidence as the centrepiece 
  of his defence, relying on it as highly persuasive evidence that he was not 
  present at the Ottey home when Marsha and Tamara were killed. </p>
<p>
  [127] In addition to the two theories of liability advanced by the Crown, the 
  trial judge left it open to the jury to find the appellant guilty even if he 
  was not present &quot;in or about&quot; the Ottey home, if the jury was satisfied 
  that the appellant aided or abetted Adrian Kinkead in killing the Ottey sisters. 
  The trial judge told the jury that it would be critical to their determination 
  that the appellant was an aider or abettor for them to find as a fact that the 
  appellant had the sole motive to kill Marsha Ottey, that Adrian Kinkead had 
  no motive to kill either sister, and that a false break and enter was staged 
  to divert suspicion from the appellant. The appellant contends that the trial 
  judge erred in leaving this third theory of liability with the jury. </p>
<p>
  [128] First, the appellant argues that there was no evidentiary basis to support 
  the third theory of liability. The appellant submits that a conviction cannot 
  reasonably be based solely on evidence of motive and association with Adrian 
  Kinkead in the absence of any evidence to suggest that he had asked, or in any 
  way, aided or abetted, Adrian Kinkead to kill Marsha or Tamara Ottey. Second, 
  the appellant submits that it was fundamentally unfair to leave this additional 
  theory with the jury when the Crown had expressly disavowed it and defence counsel 
  had addressed the jury based on the understanding that the trial judge would 
  not charge the jury on this basis. The appellant submits that this third theory, 
  which left it open to the jury to convict him even if they found that he was 
  not in or about the Ottey home at the relevant time, was critical since it could 
  potentially rebut his strongest piece of exculpatory evidence, the Scarborough 
  Town Centre evidence. The appellant notes that the instructions on aiding and 
  abetting were obviously of interest to the jury since they asked a question 
  on the subject-matter during the course of their deliberations. Indeed, the 
  appellant submits that the verdict of manslaughter in respect of the death of 
  Tamara Ottey suggests that the jury may have convicted the appellant on this 
  third theory of liability. </p>
<p>
  [129] In response to this ground of appeal, the Crown argues that trial judges 
  are duty bound to instruct juries on every basis of liability and on every defence 
  with a sufficient evidentiary foundation, regardless of the position of either 
  counsel for the Crown or the defence. The Crown submits that the evidence in 
  this case could support a conclusion that the appellant had aided or abetted 
  Adrian Kinkead in committing the offences without the appellant being present 
  when the Ottey sisters were killed. The Crown also argues that the trial judge's 
  instructions regarding aiding or abetting did not catch the appellant by surprise. 
  The Crown states that at trial, as well as on this appeal, there was no suggestion 
  that the appellant might have done anything differently had he known that the 
  trial judge would charge the jury as he did. Rather, the appellant would have 
  maintained the same position that he took throughout the trial: that he had 
  nothing to do with any aspect of killing Marsha and Tamara Ottey. </p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>A. The Issues</strong> </p>
<p>
  [130] This ground of appeal raises the following issues: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) Was there a sufficient evidentiary basis to leave it open 
  to the jury to convict the appellant even if they were not satisfied that he 
  was in or about the Ottey home on the morning of the homicides? </p>
<p class="indent">(b) Assuming that there was a sufficient evidentiary basis, 
  was the instruction on the additional theory of liability unfair in the circumstances 
  of this case? </p>
<p>
  [131] On the first question, the Crown submits that there was evidence upon 
  which a reasonable and properly instructed jury could conclude that the appellant 
  was a party to the offences while still having a reasonable doubt about whether 
  he was actually present at the Ottey home during the homicides. The appellant 
  submits that there was no air of reality to this third theory of liability. 
  </p>
<p>
  [132] It is clear that the instruction would constitute reversible error if 
  there were no evidentiary basis to leave the third theory of liability to the 
  jury. However, I do not find it necessary (or advisable since there will be 
  a new trial) to make a final determination on this question since, in my view, 
  this ground of appeal turns on the question of trial fairness. I will therefore 
  address only issue (b) and assume that the instruction on the third theory of 
  liability was supported by the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [133] As I will explain, it is the trial judge's role to instruct the jury on 
  all relevant questions of law that arise on the evidence. In some cases, these 
  instructions will not accord with the position advanced by counsel for the Crown 
  or the defence. In all cases, however, the trial judge's role will be circumscribed 
  by the need to ensure trial fairness. In the particular circumstances of this 
  case, it is my view that the trial judge's failure to notify counsel of his 
  intention to charge the jury on this additional basis of liability undermined 
  the appellant's ability to make full answer and defence. </p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>B. Analysis</strong></p>
<p class="indent15"> <em>1. The trial judge's role</em></p>
<p> [134] The underlying question that arises is whether the Crown is bound by 
  the theory that it advances. To put the question in another way, can an accused 
  be convicted on a basis other than that advanced by the Crown? In this respect, 
  it is important to note that there is a distinction between particulars given 
  by the Crown under s. 587 of the Criminal Code and the Crown's theory of the 
  case. While the Crown is generally bound to prove formal particulars, it is 
  not bound to prove the theory that it advances in order to secure a conviction. 
  A conviction is based, rather, on proof of the necessary elements of the offence. 
  Hence this court, in <em>R. v. Groot </em>(1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 293, aff'd 
  [1999] 3 S.C.R. 664, 144 C.C.C. (3d) 287, rejected the general proposition that 
  once the Crown presented a particular theory it would be unfairly prejudicial 
  to the accused in any case to allow the trier to convict on a different theory. 
  The question turned, rather, on whether the accused, in the particular case 
  under review, was able to present a full and fair defence. </p>
<p>
  [135] We must therefore start from the premise that the jury is not bound by 
  the theory of the Crown in its consideration of the evidence. Nor is it bound 
  by the theory of the defence. Hence, in order to provide the jury with the assistance 
  that it requires in dealing with the evidence, the trial judge may well find 
  it necessary to instruct the jury in a manner that does not accord with the 
  theory advanced by either Crown or defence counsel at trial. </p>
<p>
  [136] I did not interpret the appellant's submissions in this case as disputing 
  this general principle. The concern that was raised relates, rather, to its 
  particular application in this case. Indeed, in any case where the trial judge 
  instructs the jury on a material point in a manner that does not accord with 
  the position advanced by either party, a question may arise whether this course 
  impacted on the fairness of the trial. For example, depending on the circumstances, 
  an accused may argue that his or her principal defence was undermined by the 
  manner in which the trial judge left an alternative defence open to the jury. 
  The concern about trial fairness, however, will be greater when the instruction 
  relates to a theory of liability that has not been advanced by the Crown.</p>
<p> [137] In <em>R. v. Gregory</em> (1981), 77 Cr. App. R. 41 (C.A.), the precise 
  question was raised whether the trial judge erred in instructing the jury on 
  a new alternative basis of liability without counsel being given the opportunity 
  to comment upon it during their addresses. In the particular circumstances of 
  the case, the English Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge's failure 
  to notify counsel in a timely manner did not constitute a material irregularity 
  and, even if it did, the court was prepared to apply the curative proviso on 
  the basis that no miscarriage of justice had actually occurred. However, the 
  court commented as follows (at p. 47): </p>
<p class="indent">
  Nevertheless, we think it right to say that it is desirable that counsel should 
  be told by the judge, before speeches begin, of any direction which he proposes 
  to give to the jury which would allow of a conviction upon a basis of which 
  no previous indication had been given during the trial up to that point. </p>
<p> [138] For examples of other cases where the trial judge instructed the jury 
  in respect of a theory of liability that was not advanced by the Crown, see 
  <em>R. v. Kent et al</em>. (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 405 (Man. C.A.); <em>R. v. 
  Cousins</em> (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 432 (Nfld. C.A.) and <em>R. v. Oakwell</em>, 
  [1978] 1 All E.R. 1223 (C.A.). However, I do not find it necessary for the disposition 
  of this ground of appeal to consider these decisions further. The question whether 
  a trial judge's instruction on an alternate theory of liability had an adverse 
  impact on the fairness of the trial is one that can only be determined on a 
  case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>
  [139] This ground of appeal therefore turns on the particular circumstances 
  of the case as they relate to this issue. </p>
<p class="indent15"> <em>2. The discussions at trial and the instructions to the 
  jury </em></p>
<p>
  [140] I note at the outset that there is no suggestion that the appellant was 
  prejudiced by the introduction of the third theory of liability in the marshalling 
  of the evidence. In other words, the appellant does not argue, and in my view 
  could not argue, that he would have conducted the cross-examination of Crown 
  witnesses differently or that he would have called evidence on his behalf if 
  he had known that this third theory of liability would be left with the jury. 
  Although the theories of the Crown, throughout the trial, were that the appellant 
  himself had killed the Ottey sisters, or that he had assisted Kinkead in killing 
  them, the jury is not bound by those theories and the question of whether the 
  appellant could be found guilty based on some other form of participation remained 
  open to the jury depending on the evidence. The allegation of prejudice in this 
  case is based, rather, on the discussions that transpired after the Crown's 
  case was closed. The appellant submits that he was led to believe that the jury 
  would be instructed solely in accordance with the theories advanced by the Crown 
  and that, consequently, counsel was deprived of the opportunity to address the 
  third theory of liability in his closing address to the jury. It therefore becomes 
  necessary to review some of those discussions in more detail to determine whether 
  the appellant was prejudiced as contended.</p>
<p>
  [141] The question of whether the appellant could be found guilty if the jury 
  was not satisfied that he was present in the Ottey house at the time of the 
  killings arose several times during discussions among the trial judge, the Crown 
  and defence counsel. The question first arose during a motion for a directed 
  verdict. The matter was also canvassed among the trial judge and counsel at 
  least four times after the appellant elected not to call any evidence and before 
  defence counsel started his closing address to the jury. The question next arose 
  during the pre-charge discussions that followed both counsel's closing addresses. 
  Finally, the issue was raised in defence counsel's objections to the trial judge's 
  charge to the jury. </p>
<p class="indent20">
  (a) Motion for a directed verdict</p>
<p>
  [142] At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence moved for a directed 
  verdict of acquittal. It is apparent from the submissions and the exchanges 
  among the trial judge and both counsel on the motion that no one anticipated 
  at that time that the appellant could be found guilty if the jury was not satisfied 
  that he was present in the Ottey house at the time of the killings. The question 
  was simply never raised. In particular, I note the following.</p>
<p>
  [143] During the course of his submissions, defence counsel stated: &quot;Well, 
  I feel on this evidence here, on this evidence, the Crown has got to prove and 
  put the accused in that house.&quot; To which the trial judge responded: &quot;Yes. 
  Oh, no doubt, no doubt.&quot; Crown counsel, in responding to the motion, never 
  suggested that the appellant could be found guilty without being at the scene. 
  To the contrary, when asked by the trial judge whether he was going to suggest 
  to the jury that there must have been more than one person involved, the Crown 
  stated: &quot;Yes. Yes, I am, and I'm going to suggest to the jury in due course 
  that indeed there were two people there because of several things.&quot; Crown 
  counsel then explained why he thought the evidence supported the theory of two 
  persons being in the house at the time of the killings.</p>
<p>
  [144] The motion for a directed verdict was dismissed and the defence elected 
  to call no evidence. </p>
<p class="indent20">
  (b) Discussions prior to defence counsel's address to the jury </p>
<p> [145] The trial judge, Crown counsel and defence counsel discussed the appellant's 
  liability on the basis that he was not present during the commission of the 
  offences on four occasions after the appellant elected not to call any evidence 
  and before defence counsel started his closing address to the jury. The discussions 
  generally arose in the context of whether the trial judge would charge the jury 
  on the counselling provisions set out in s. 22 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. 
  The trial judge first raised this possibility when he canvassed counsel prior 
  to their closing addresses proposing a pre-charge conference. The trial judge 
  asked Crown counsel, by way of example, whether the Crown would want the jury 
  instructed on the possibility of convicting the appellant on the basis of counselling, 
  assuming the jury found that Adrian Kinkead went into the house alone and killed 
  the two sisters. Crown counsel stated that that he did want this possibility 
  to be left with the jury. Defence counsel objected on the basis that there was 
  no evidence in support of this theory. The matter was left unresolved and the 
  court adjourned. </p>
<p> [146] The discussion resumed two days later when various issues regarding 
  the trial judge's charge were discussed, including whether the jury should be 
  charged in regard to the counselling provisions set out in s. 22 of the <em>Criminal 
  Code</em>. The following exchange took place between the trial judge and the 
  Crown: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Court: Okay. The counselling would only go on the scenario 
  that Mr. Kinkead alone &#133; committed the murders.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Clark: Yes.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court: Do you want that possibility to be put?</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Clark: Yes, if it please the Court&#133; you may have one 
  or more jurors who aren't satisfied that Mr. Ranger was there&#133;. </p>
<p>[147] Very shortly after this exchange, defence counsel stated 
  that he was &quot;very troubled about the fact that there may be a charge on 
  the issue of counselling&quot;, given that there was no evidence, according 
  to defence counsel, that Adrian Kinkead committed the murders without the appellant 
  being present. The trial judge, after confirming with the Crown that counselling 
  would be a &quot;tertiary&quot; approach, suggested that the Crown think about 
  his position and stated &quot;if you don't want me to put it to the jury, I 
  won't put it to the jury, but if you end up at that time wanting me to put it 
  to the jury, I'll put it to the jury&quot;. At this point, court adjourned until 
  the following Monday, when the Crown was to start his closing address to the 
  jury. </p>
<p>
  [148] When court next resumed, Crown counsel, just before starting his closing 
  address to the jury, asked the trial judge not to leave counselling with the 
  jury. The relevant exchange was as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Mr. Clark: The first thing is, I've reflected upon this at 
  some length, the question that Your Lordship put last day which is whether the 
  Crown wanted you to leave counselling with the jury. I've decided I'd ask you 
  not to leave it.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court: All right. That's fine.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Charles: What? I didn't hear that.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Scott: Not leave counselling.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court: Not leave counselling, s. 22.</p>
<p>
  [149] Crown counsel then made his final address to the jury. At no point in 
  his closing address did the Crown even imply that the appellant was not present 
  at the Ottey home when Marsha and Tamara were killed or that the jury could 
  find the appellant guilty if they were not satisfied he was present when the 
  killings took place. To the contrary, when describing who can be a party to 
  an offence, the Crown told the jury: </p>
<p class="indent"> What does abet mean you ask? Abet is simply a legal word that 
  means encourage or incite if you will. If someone is stabbing another person 
  and I say, &quot;Atta boy, give it to him&quot;, I'm guilty just as if I were 
  the stabber. Why? Because I've abetted the person, so you have to understand 
  about parties, as I say, because to a certain extent, there will at the end 
  of the day perhaps be in your minds some uncertainty as to exactly how events 
  unfolded in that basement, <em>but so long, ladies and gentlemen, as you're 
  satisfied that Mr. Ranger was in that basement</em> and if he wasn't the stabber, 
  he was certainly doing something to either aid, help, assist, call it what you 
  want, or encourage Mr. Kinkead to do anything, then he's equally guilty, <em>but 
  I'm going to suggest to you at the end of the day that it's obvious that it's 
  this man, Mr. Ranger, who in fact is the stabber for reasons I'll develop in 
  due course</em> [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [150] At a recess during the Crown's closing submissions, the trial judge advised 
  counsel that he had prepared portions of his jury charge. In this context, he 
  stated: &quot;I've got some of the sections done. &#133; I'll have to excise 
  counselling to commit an offence.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [151] The following exchange then occurred between defence counsel and the trial 
  judge immediately before defence counsel's closing submissions to the jury: </p>
<p class="indent"> Mr. Charles: And there is one theory, as I understand the Crown's 
  case, it is that it was Mr. Ranger who killed those two girls.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court: It doesn't matter who killed them if there's aiding 
  and abetting. I obviously have to put aiding or abetting.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Charles: But there is not one scintilla of aiding and abetting, 
  a scintilla of evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court: No, if the other person's present in there, that 
  would bespeak greatly of a joint plan to kill, so if there's a joint plan to 
  kill, it's both aiding and abetting. If he's there, he's guilty as either a 
  principal or a secondary offender.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Charles: The point in this case is has the Crown been able 
  to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Ranger was in that house&#133; 
  That is the pivotal issue in this case.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court: I tend to agree.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Charles: Yes.</p>
<p class="indent">The Court: Do you tend to agree Mr. Clark?</p>
<p class="indent"><em>Mr. Clark: Yes</em>, I think that's in some sense fair, 
  yes.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">The Court: You want me to put that the Crown has to prove that 
  somehow he was inside the premises.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Charles: Yes, and the video, which is the most compelling 
  evidence, better than a thousand witnesses, puts him there at Scarborough Town 
  Centre at a certain time [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="indent20">(c) Defence's closing address</p>
<p>
  [152] Defence counsel then addressed the jury on the basis that his client could 
  not be found guilty unless the jury was satisfied that he was present when Marsha 
  and Tamara Ottey were killed. For example, at one point defence counsel stated 
  the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> Now, Mr. Clark makes much of the association between Rohan 
  Ranger and Adrian Kinkead, but a lot of his evidentiary basis for this comes 
  from a tainted source, that being Mr. Kinkead himself. In any event, in this 
  country we cannot be found guilty through association. T<em>he association, 
  in my submission to you, of Ranger with Kinkead cannot lead to his guilt unless 
  you conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that they were both at the crime scene,</em> 
  one or the other aiding, either both directly involved or aiding and abetting 
  the other [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [153] In a similar vein, defence counsel, at the close of his jury address, 
  framed the issue for the jury as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The pivotal issue here is this. Are you sure on the evidence before this Court 
  that Rohan Ranger was at 88 Valley Stream in the early morning of August 16, 
  1995? &#133; The evidence points much more strongly to Kinkead being the sole 
  killer of the Ottey sisters and fails to prove Mr. Ranger's guilt by a long 
  measure, never mind a reasonable doubt. </p>

  (d) Pre-charge discussion following closing submissions</p>
<p>
  [154] The pre-charge discussions that followed both counsels' closing submissions 
  included further references to the appellant's liability if he was not at the 
  scene. At one point, the trial judge stated to counsel that in his view there 
  were three scenarios on which the jury could convict, the third being one where 
  &quot;Ranger isn't there and they can only convict on that scenario on the basis 
  that he aids and abets as a positive act in the sense of aiding and abetting.&quot; 
  Defence counsel reminded the trial judge at this point about the Crown's request, 
  made before either counsel had made closing jury submissions, that the trial 
  judge not instruct the jury on counselling. The trial judge responded to this 
  by distinguishing between counselling and aiding and abetting and by stating 
  that neither he nor the jury were bound by the Crown's position. </p>
<p class="indent20">
  (e) Trial judge's charge to the jury</p>
<p>
  [155] The trial judge instructed the jury that there were three scenarios according 
  to which they could find the appellant guilty of any offence in respect of the 
  death of Marsha or Tamara Ottey. The first scenario was that the jury was satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant actually killed one or both of 
  the Ottey sisters. The second scenario was that they were satisfied beyond a 
  reasonable doubt that Adrian Kinkead actually killed one or both of the Ottey 
  sisters and that the appellant, while in the basement of the Ottey home, aided 
  or abetted him. The third scenario, and the one that is in question on this 
  appeal, was that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Adrian Kinkead 
  actually killed one or both of the Ottey sisters and that the appellant aided 
  or abetted him, but in this scenario the appellant was not present in the basement 
  or at the crime scene when he aided or abetted Adrian Kinkead. </p>
<p>
  [156] During the course of his main charge, the trial judge instructed the jury 
  on five separate occasions that they could convict the appellant, even if he 
  was not present in the basement or at the crime scene at the time that Marsha 
  and Tamara Ottey were killed. One of these instructions was made in the context 
  of explaining the meaning of &quot;abet&quot;. The trial judge instructed the 
  jury on this point as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> It is necessary to keep in mind that the Crown need not prove 
  that the accused, Ranger, was present in the basement in order to prove beyond 
  a reasonable doubt that the accused, Ranger, aided or abetted Adrian Kinkead 
  in the latter's intentional killings of the Ottey sisters.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Abetting simply means the giving of any form of encouragement. 
  However, the encouragement must have been given by Ranger, the secondary offender, 
  again with the knowledge and the purpose that Kinkead intentionally kill the 
  Ottey sisters.</p>
<p class="indent">Assuming you find as a fact that the accused, Ranger, enlisted 
  the aid of his cousin to intentionally kill the Ottey sisters, it is then open 
  to you to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Ranger is guilty as a 
  secondary party to Kinkead's murders of the Ottey sisters so long as the accused 
  requested the aid of Kinkead with the knowledge and purpose that the Ottey sisters 
  be intentionally killed by Kinkead. A request to kill someone constitutes a 
  positive act of abetting or encouragement. I repeat, a request to kill someone 
  constitutes a positive act of abetting or encouragement.</p>
<p>
  [157] The final instruction on this issue was given almost at the very end of 
  his charge, when the trial judge summarized for the jury what approach they 
  should take. He told the jury that, first, they must evaluate the evidence in 
  a global fashion in an attempt to determine the truth of the case, and second, 
  they must relate their evaluation of the whole of the evidence to the essential 
  elements that must be proven by the Crown. He then twice repeated the following 
  instruction: </p>
<p class="indent"> It seems to me that should you find as fact that the accused, 
  Rohan Ranger, was in or about 88 Valley Stream around the time the Ottey sisters 
  were killed, that finding of fact will be a giant step towards your being satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused unlawfully participated in the killing 
  of the Ottey sisters. In making that determination, you must assess the evidence 
  cumulatively and not in piecemeal fashion. Thus the evidence of Victor Lo must 
  not be assessed in isolation but must be weighed together with all the evidence, 
  including the evidence of motive, association, death threats, staging and any 
  other evidence you find relevant to this determination.</p>
<p class="indent">Assuming, however, that the Crown fails to prove to your satisfaction 
  the accused, Rohan Ranger, was in or about 88 Valley Stream around the time 
  the Ottey sisters were killed, it would still be open to you to be satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, Rohan Ranger, unlawfully participated 
  in the killing of the Ottey sisters. In making that determination, I again caution 
  you not to fall into the trap of assessing evidence in isolation from all the 
  other evidence relevant to that determination. </p>
<p class="indent">However, it will be critical to your determination that the 
  accused, Rohan Ranger, was an aider or abettor that you find as fact that the 
  accused, Rohan Ranger, had the sole motive to kill Marsha Ottey, that Adrian 
  Kinkead had no motive to kill either Ottey sister and that a false break and 
  enter was staged to divert suspicion from Marsha Ottey's ex-boyfriend [emphasis 
  added]. </p>
<p>
  [158] During the course of the deliberations, the jury returned with three questions, 
  including the following: &quot;how does aiding apply to a person who has indirectly 
  caused the death?&quot; After recharging the jury on what a secondary party 
  is and giving examples of aiding and abetting, the trial judge instructed the 
  jury, in the context of manslaughter, that &quot;it is fundamentally important 
  to note, and I think I have mentioned this already, that a secondary party to 
  an offence need not, need not be present at the crime scene in order to be criminally 
  responsible as either an aider or an abettor.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [159] Similarly, the trial judge later stated: &quot;For either second degree 
  murder or a planned and deliberate first degree murder, an accused may be liable 
  as a secondary party by either aiding or abetting the murder and need not have 
  been present when the murder was committed by the principal offender.&quot; 
  </p>
<p>
  [160] The trial judge's entire re-charge, which included the portions just referred 
  to, was typed out later that day and read again to the jury the next day. As 
  well, each member of the jury received a copy of the typed version of the trial 
  judge's re-charge.</p>
<p class="indent20">
  (f) Defence counsel's objections to the instructions </p>
<p>
  [161] At the conclusion of the trial judge's charge to the jury, and again following 
  the trial judge's re-charge, defence counsel objected to the instruction that 
  the jury could find the appellant guilty without being satisfied that he was 
  present at the crime scene. Counsel took the position that the trial judge's 
  instruction to the jury that they could find the appellant guilty of aiding 
  and abetting, without finding him present at the crime scene, was, effectively, 
  the same as the jury finding that the appellant counselled Adrian Kinkead, a 
  matter on which the trial judge had said he would not charge the jury. The trial 
  judge declined defence counsel's request that he re-charge the jury on this 
  issue. </p>
<p class="indent15"> <em>3. Conclusion </em></p>
<p>
  [162] It is clear that the trial judge's instructions left it open to the jury 
  to find the appellant guilty, even if they did not accept that the appellant 
  was present at the time of the killings, if they were satisfied that the appellant 
  somehow aided or abetted Adrian Kinkead in killing Marsha and Tamara Ottey. 
  In light of what transpired at trial, it is my view that it was reasonable for 
  defence counsel to have understood from the discussions that preceded his closing 
  address to the jury that the trial judge would not charge the jury on that basis. 
  Independent of any conclusions as to whether the trial judge's instructions 
  were correct in law and whether they were supported by the evidence, in the 
  context of this case, they effectively undermined the essence of the defence's 
  position, that is, that the appellant should be acquitted because the Crown 
  failed to prove that he was at the Ottey home in the early morning of August 
  16, 1995. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the appellant was not 
  materially prejudiced by the trial judge's failure to notify counsel of his 
  intention to charge the jury on this additional theory of liability before counsel's 
  final address to the jury. </p>
<p>
  [163] In the particular circumstances that I have described, I would give effect 
  to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p> <strong>VII. THE IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE</strong></p>
<p>
  [164] The identification evidence was a very important part of the Crown's case. 
  The Crown called five witnesses who testified about having seen a man in a walkway 
  across the street from the Ottey home around 7:30 a.m. on the days immediately 
  preceding and on the morning that Marsha and Tamara Ottey were killed. Two of 
  those witnesses, Victor Lo and Neville Downes, gave evidence directly implicating 
  the appellant as the person seen in the walkway. </p>
<p>
  [165] Victor Lo testified that he saw the same man crouching in the walkway 
  around 7:30 a.m. on August 15 and on August 16. Mr. Lo was shown a police photo 
  line-up on September 14, 1995. He was 90 percent sure that the appellant's photograph 
  was a photograph of the man he had seen in the walkway and about 30 percent 
  sure that another man's photograph was of the man in the walkway. Mr. Lo answered 
  &quot;yes&quot; to the question: &quot;The person that you saw in the walkway 
  those two days, do you think that you'd recognize that person if you were to 
  see that person again?&quot; Mr. Lo, however, was then unable to identify the 
  appellant as that person in court. </p>
<p>
  [166] Neville Downes saw a man standing in the walkway shortly before 7:30 a.m. 
  on August 15. Mr. Downes picked someone other than the appellant in a photo 
  line-up shortly after the event, yet he purported to identify the appellant 
  in?dock a year and a half later. </p>
<p>
  [167] There is no doubt that it would be a critical finding against the appellant 
  if the jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was in 
  the walkway across from the Ottey home, particularly on the morning of August 
  16. As the trial judge put it in his final instructions, that finding would 
  be &quot;a giant step&quot; towards the jury being satisfied beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that the appellant unlawfully participated in the murders. The critical 
  importance of this evidence was not lost on this jury, as demonstrated by their 
  request during the course of their deliberations that the evidence of all the 
  identification witnesses be read back to them. In these circumstances, it was 
  essential that the trial judge instruct the jury properly in connection with 
  this evidence, most particularly with respect to the evidence of Mr. Lo and 
  Mr. Downes, the two witnesses who directly implicated the appellant. </p>
<p>
  [168] The appellant raises several concerns with the trial judge's charge to 
  the jury. The gist of the appellant's position on this ground of appeal is that 
  the trial judge's instructions, when considered as a whole and in the light 
  of the Crown's closing submissions, did not effectively convey to the jury the 
  dangers of relying on the evidence of the walkway witnesses. Rather, these instructions 
  may have left the jury with the impression that they could place greater weight 
  on this evidence than it reasonably deserved. I agree with this contention. 
  I will review the most significant features of the charge that lead me to that 
  conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [169] First, there is no question that Mr. Downes' evidence had no probative 
  value on the question of identification of the appellant. He had not only been 
  unable to pick out the appellant from a photo line-up, but had picked out another 
  person as the person he had seen in the walkway. Nonetheless, Mr. Downes purported 
  to identify the appellant in-dock at the preliminary hearing and at the trial. 
  </p>
<p>
  [170] Mr. Lo's evidence was also very weak. His identification of the appellant 
  in the photo line-up was, at best, equivocal and at trial, non-existent. Although 
  the trial judge gave general instructions on the frailties of identification 
  evidence and, in particular, on the &quot;negligible&quot; value of in-dock 
  identification, his juxtaposition of Mr. Lo's and Mr. Downes' evidence may have 
  left the jury with the impression that Mr. Downes' evidence had some evidentiary 
  value, and that Mr. Lo's evidence was more reliable in conjunction with Mr. 
  Downes' than it was standing alone. In this respect, I note the following excerpt 
  from the jury charge: </p>
<p class="indent"> In this case, Neville Downes &#133; was unable to identify 
  anyone in the photo line-up, even though the accused's picture was included 
  in the photo line-up. However, Mr. Downes was able to identify the accused much 
  later when he saw him in the flesh at the preliminary inquiry. Conversely, Victor 
  Lo identified the accused from a photo line-up much earlier after the event 
  but was unable to identify him in court at this trial. Inasmuc<em>h as Victor 
  Lo identified the accused from a group of twelve more closely to the day when 
  he allegedly saw the accused, his evidence is <strong>much more reliable </strong>than 
  that of Mr. Downes</em>. After all, Mr. Downes identified the accused much later 
  after the event and did not do so in an objective comparison with others but 
  in a biased setting where it should have been obvious to him who the accused 
  was [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [171] Second, the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that they were entitled 
  to give some weight to Mr. Lo's failure to identify the appellant at trial: 
  see <em>R. v. Hibbert</em>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 445 at para. 49, 163 C.C.C. (3d) 
  129. Rather, he instructed jury as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> However, Mr. Lo did not identify the accused in court. Obviously, 
  the accused while in court was wearing a suit and tie, had glasses on and was 
  not wearing a cap as the stranger was on the days in question. <em>The fact 
  that Mr. Lo did not identify the accused in court should not otherwise undermine 
  the reliability of his identification evidence</em>. However, it is for you 
  to determine whether Mr. Lo's evidence is otherwise reliable, keeping in mind 
  the inherent weakness of identification evidence [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [172] Third, when the trial judge's instructions are considered as a whole and 
  in the context of the Crown's theory, I find merit to the appellant's submission 
  that the repeated reference to Mr. Lo's evidence as &quot;identification&quot; 
  was, if not a mischaracterization as contended, certainly a dangerous exaggeration 
  of his description of the man he had seen in the walkway. As noted by the appellant 
  in his factum, Mr. Lo's testimony was referred to as &quot;identification&quot; 
  evidence at least eight times during the course of the trial judge's charge 
  and eighteen times in the Crown's closing submissions. </p>
<p> [173] Finally, I also agree with the appellant's submission that the trial 
  judge's failure to properly instruct the jury on Mr. Lo's evidence was aggravated 
  by the misstatement of the evidence by the Crown concerning a critical part 
  of Mr. Lo's description and the trial judge's repetition of this error in his 
  charge. The Crown argued that it was no coincidence that <em>all but one</em> 
  of the walkway witnesses described the hair of the person seen in the walkway 
  as being &quot;close cropped and virtually shaved up the sides.&quot; A photo 
  of the appellant taken on the day after the Ottey sisters were killed showed 
  him sporting a short, shaved haircut. Crown counsel dealt with this evidence 
  in his closing address by stating the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> Well, look at the big inset, ladies and gentlemen, and look 
  at the haircut on that man. Look at the haircut and recall for yourselves when 
  you look at it, recall the evidence of all those walkway people and I think 
  and I stand to be corrected, but with the exception of Kevin Peters, who is 
  Mr. Downes' stepson, with the exception of Mr. Peters, who as I recollect didn't 
  give an account of what the man at the end of the walkway's hair looked like,<em> 
  the other witnesses all talked about it being close cropped and virtually shaved 
  up the sides</em>. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's exactly what you've got 
  in Exhibit 236-10. You've got somebody with a shaved haircut. So is it just 
  again one more unfortunate coincidence? Mr. Lo gets the wrong guy out of the 
  picture, so will the defence say, and not only do they get the wrong guy, but 
  they get the wrong guy and <em>describe a man with a short, shaved haircut </em>and, 
  gee whiz, there's Mr. Ranger with a short, shaved haircut. One more unfortunate 
  coincidence. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; [W]hen you turn it around, [Mr. Lo's evidence] becomes 
  very powerful identification evidence. A month later he picks out the only guy 
  we know who's connected to that street, <em>describes him having a haircut just 
  like he had.</em> That photograph's taken the very next day, ladies and gentlemen, 
  the very next day. I suggest to you Mr. Lo got it right [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [174] In his charge to the jury, the trial judge reiterated the Crown's description 
  of the evidence in his review of the Crown's position: </p>
<p class="indent"> Look at Exhibit 236-10 from 330 McCowan taken the next day, 
  on Thursday, August 17, 1995 in which Ranger is not wearing glasses and has 
  close-cropped hair shaven at the sides, <em>exactly as described by the majority 
  of the witnesses</em> [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [175] In fact, of the five witnesses who saw a young black male in the walkway, 
  only Mr. Peters described the man as having the sides of his head shaved bald. 
  The Crown's claim that Mr. Lo described the man as having a &quot;short, shaved 
  haircut&quot; was contrary to the evidence. Mr. Lo testified that he was not 
  sure if the man he saw had any head hair because he had his hat pulled down. 
  Given the critical importance of Mr. Lo's evidence, I cannot agree with the 
  Crown's contention on appeal that this error was &quot;little&quot; or &quot;harmless.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [176] For these reasons, I conclude that the instructions to the jury on identification 
  evidence were inadequate and constituted reversible error. </p>
<p> <strong>VIII. OTHER GROUNDS OF APPEAL</strong></p>
<p>
  [177] In view of my conclusion that there must be a new trial based on the errors 
  discussed above, I will briefly address the other grounds of appeal that may 
  impact on the conduct of a new trial. </p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>A. Leaving manslaughter as an available verdict</strong></p>
<p> [178] It is common ground between the parties that the trial judge erred in 
  leaving manslaughter as an available verdict on the basis that rage could constitute 
  a partial defence to the charge of murder. In a decision released sometime after 
  this trial, the Supreme Court of Canada held that there is no defence of rage 
  reducing murder to manslaughter: <em>R. v. Parent</em>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 761, 
  154 C.C.C. (3d) 1. </p>
<p>
  [179] The Crown takes the position, however, that this error benefited the appellant. 
  The appellant disagrees, arguing that the manner in which manslaughter was left 
  to the jury undermined his principal defence in this case, which was that he 
  had nothing at all to do with the killing of Marsha and Tamara Ottey.</p>
<p>
  [180] In light of the fact that there will be a new trial on the charges of 
  first degree murder and manslaughter, it serves no useful purpose to deal with 
  this additional argument. </p>
<p class="indent"> <strong>B. Hearsay evidence </strong></p>
<p>
  [181] Eighteen witnesses called by the Crown testified about statements that 
  Marsha Ottey made to them relating to her relationship with the appellant after 
  their break-up. In these statements, Marsha had related that the appellant was 
  making unwanted calls and visits to her, that he was unhappy with her plans 
  to go to school in the United States, and that he had threatened her. Marsha 
  had also described how the appellant was persistent in his obsessive and jealous 
  behaviour towards her, and how she was scared of him. </p>
<p> [182] The trial judge held a <em>voir dire</em> to determine the admissibility of these 
  statements as exceptions to the rule against hearsay. Over the objection of 
  the appellant, the trial judge did not hear oral evidence during the<em> <em>voir dire</em></em>. Rather, he relied either on transcripts of the evidence that the 
  proposed witnesses gave at the preliminary inquiry or on statements they had 
  given to the police. The <em><em>voir dire</em></em> proceeded with the trial judge reviewing 
  each hearsay statement, with defence counsel either conceding or objecting to 
  the admissibility of the statement.</p>
<p> [183] The appellant raises three main concerns with the <em>voir dire</em> procedure 
  followed by the trial judge. First, he submits that it was incumbent upon the 
  trial judge to hear oral evidence on the <em><em>voir dire</em></em> to determine whether 
  it was sufficiently reliable to warrant admission at trial. Second, he submits 
  that the trial judge did not make a threshold assessment of the reliability 
  of each individual proposed statement; rather, it appears that he accepted the 
  Crown's argument that this criterion could be met on the basis that Marsha was 
  &quot;a reliable historian.&quot; The appellant argues that this approach is 
  improper and contrary to the factors for assessing threshold reliability set 
  out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>R. v. Starr</em>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 
  144, 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449. Third, the appellant submits that the trial judge 
  made no inquiry into the necessity of calling all these witnesses, whose evidence 
  was repetitive. He submits that the calling of these witnesses turned the trial, 
  for a large part, into a trial about the appellant's relationship with Marsha.</p>
<p>
  [184] I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. My reasons with respect 
  to each point can be stated succinctly. </p>
<p>
  [185] First, I see no reason to interfere with the trial judge's decision to 
  proceed on the basis of transcripts and summaries of the proposed evidence. 
  The question whether oral evidence will be required or not on the <em>voir dire</em> 
  is one to be determined according to the nature of the evidence in question 
  and the issues to be canvassed. I note in this respect that, later in the course 
  of the <em>voir dire</em>, the trial judge modified his ruling and indicated that he 
  would permit either party to call those witnesses who had not testified at the 
  preliminary hearing if they saw fit. Neither party sought to call witnesses 
  at that time. When considered in its entirety, I am not persuaded that the procedure 
  followed did not allow for a full canvassing of the relevant issues. </p>
<p> [186] Second, the trial in this matter occurred two years before the Supreme 
  Court of Canada's decision in <em>R. v. Starr, supra</em>. The Crown concedes 
  that the trial judge referred to factors the Supreme Court later held should 
  not be considered when deciding threshold reliability. The Crown submits, however, 
  that the trial judge's decision that the statements were reliable was inevitable. 
  I do not find it necessary to determine whether the trial judge erred in admitting 
  any of the statements on the basis that he did. In view of the fact that there 
  will be a new trial, this is a matter to be determined in light of the more 
  recent jurisprudence at the new trial.</p>
<p> [187] Third, I see no merit to the appellant's contention that the trial judge 
  erred in failing to consider whether it was necessary to call all of the proposed 
  witnesses. The necessity component of the two-part threshold test for the admission 
  of hearsay evidence does not extend to an assessment of whether the proposed 
  evidence is unnecessary in the sense that it may be repetitious. What, in fact, 
  the appellant is arguing is that there is an overall discretion for the trial 
  judge to exclude evidence that is otherwise relevant and probative, if its prejudicial 
  effect outweighs its probative value. On this point, he relies on the decision 
  in <em>R. v. Parsons</em> (1996), 146 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 210 (Nfld. C.A.), 
  where some 40 witnesses were called to make one point. In the case at bar, however, 
  the hearsay witnesses related different statements made by Marsha Ottey or gave 
  evidence about different events. Further, the record reveals that the trial 
  judge was mindful of the cumulative effect of the admission of all of this evidence. 
  To the extent that the issue was raised at trial, the trial judge dealt with 
  the argument that the evidence would be unduly repetitive. I see no reason to 
  interfere with his decision on this issue. </p>
<p> <strong>IX. CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>
  [188] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial. The 
  Crown has not cross-appealed with respect to the conviction for manslaughter. 
  Therefore, there is to be a new trial on first-degree murder with respect to 
  Marsha and on manslaughter with respect to Tamara.</p>
