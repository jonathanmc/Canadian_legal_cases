<p>On appeal from the disposition imposed by Justice Richard E. Jennis of the 
  Ontario Court of Justice dated January 9, 2003.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant pleaded not guilty to the offence of theft under $5,000 and, 
  on consent of the Crown, pleaded guilty to assault simpliciter. The plea was 
  accepted by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant's friend was seen by a homeowner carrying a knapsack and a 
  stereo. Assuming that the goods had been taken from his home, the owner approached 
  the appellant's friend and a confrontation ensued. The appellant approached 
  the area and punched and shoved the owner to help his friend. The appellant 
  also threatened the owner and then exposed himself in front of the owner. Thereafter, 
  the appellant and his friend fled the scene and were later apprehended by the 
  police. Both were found to be significantly intoxicated.</p>
<p>
  [3] The owner did not suffer any injury at the time of the incident and suffered 
  no loss of property.</p>
<p>
  [4] During submissions on disposition on November 4, 2002, defence counsel emphasized 
  the appellant's remorse, his industriousness, his renowned good character, and 
  the support he was receiving from his family, relatives and friends in submitting 
  that a conditional discharge with proper conditions was warranted in the circumstances. 
  Crown counsel noted the seriousness of the charge and the positive contents 
  of the pre?disposition report. He was clearly not opposed to the defence submissions. 
  He also said he supposed that it would be unlikely that the trial judge would 
  feel it necessary to incarcerate the appellant. It was only after the trial 
  judge remarked that incarceration may be necessary that Crown counsel deferred 
  to the trial judge's view. Even then, he did not appear to endorse a custodial 
  disposition.</p>
<p>
  [5] On January 9, 2003, the trial judge imposed a disposition of secure custody 
  for 45 days plus probation for a period of 15 months. The appellant seeks leave 
  to appeal that disposition and, if leave be granted, appeals his disposition. 
  He was released pending appeal by order of this court on January 23, 2003.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant is 18 years of age. He was 17 years old at the time of the 
  offence. Neither he nor anyone in his family has had contact with the criminal 
  justice system. He lives with his family and appears to have enjoyed a stable 
  and happy upbringing in a good family. References submitted on his behalf confirmed 
  that he was well-adjusted, polite and well- behaved. He does not appear to have 
  a problem with alcohol, drugs or anger management. He is in the final stage 
  of completing high school and plans to attend Mohawk College next September 
  to learn a trade. He has held numerous part-time jobs.</p>
<p>
  [7] The circumstances of this offence are viewed as an isolated incident that 
  was completely out of character for the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant pleaded guilty at an early stage. Furthermore, in the intervening 
  13 months between the incident and the imposition of the disposition, he has 
  not had any legal problems and has not breached any condition of his release.</p>
<p>
  [9] The trial judge was obliged to consider and explore other alternative dispositions 
  short of custody for a young offender. He failed to do so and, as a result, 
  erred in law. Moreover, in the circumstances, the conclusion of the trial judge 
  that a non-custodial disposition would be contrary to the public interest and 
  would bring the administration of justice into disrepute is not supported by 
  the record and is unreasonable. In our view, the trial judge failed to properly 
  consider and apply the sentencing principles pertaining to first-time offenders 
  and he also failed to properly consider rehabilitation and the needs of the 
  young person. </p>
<p>
  [10] We would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and vary the disposition 
  to time served. The probation order will stand. </p>
