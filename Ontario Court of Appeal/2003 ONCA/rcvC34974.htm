<p>On appeal from the conviction of Justice V.A. Lampkin of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice dated July 2, 1999 and for leave to appeal the sentence imposed dated 
  July 13, 2000.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: April 24, 2003</p>
<p>[1] We only called on the Crown to respond to two issues: the trial's judges 
  approach to the need for corroborative and explanatory evidence, and sentence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [2] The trial judge properly recognized that this was a case requiring him to 
  proceed with caution. In his reasons, he dealt only with matters of genuine 
  concern: opportunity, concoction, and C.'s ongoing willingness to return to 
  the V. home. While he might have been clearer in addressing other inconsistencies 
  in the evidence, such as those relating to time, place or frequency of the incidents, 
  we are satisfied that, at the end of the day, it is implicit in his reasons 
  that he did not consider those inconsistencies to be of sufficient moment to 
  prevent him from relying on C.'s evidence to convict. </p>
<p> [3] With respect to the other issues, it was open to the trial judge to find 
  that R. V. was in a position of trust in connection with the female complainant 
  and we see no basis for interfering with his conclusion in this regard. Neither 
  do we think he misdirected himself on reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>
  [4] Accordingly, the appeals against conviction are dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [5] With respect to sentence, we think that the trial judge was correct to characterize 
  the offences as extremely serious and, taking into account the background of 
  the offenders, he did not err in concluding that a penitentiary term in the 
  upper single digit range was called for. </p>
<p>
  [6] However, we are not persuaded that in the exercise of his discretion, he 
  gave sufficient credit for pre-trial custody. In the unique circumstances of 
  this case, given the delays attaching to the ultimately abandoned dangerous 
  offender application and the undue length of time it took to complete 30 days 
  of evidence, particularly in light of the appellants' express wish to have the 
  trial and sentencing dealt with more expeditiously, we think they were entitled 
  to two for one credit for pre-trial custody, that is, five years and four months. 
  The appellants have now served two years and nine months of the sentence imposed 
  by the trial judge. This means that they have effectively served just over eight 
  years in prison, a fit sentence in these circumstances. </p>
<p>
  [7] Accordingly, we would grant leave to appeal sentence and vary the sentences 
  of each appellant to time served.</p>
