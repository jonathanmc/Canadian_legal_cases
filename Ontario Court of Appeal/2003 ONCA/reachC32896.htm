<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice A. William Maloney of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated August 9, 1999, and reported at [1999] O.J. No. 2853.</p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. Introduction</p>
<p>
  [1] The general question on this appeal is whether a trade association is liable 
  in tort for economic harm that it caused to a third party. </p>
<p>[2] In the late 1980s the appellant, Reach M.D. Inc., created and distributed 
  to Canadian doctors and other health care professionals a humorous and popular 
  wall calendar called &#147;Herman M.D.&#148; Reach made money on this venture 
  by selling advertising space in the calendar to drug companies, many of whom 
  were members of a voluntary trade association, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers 
  Association of Canada (&#147;PMAC&#148;). In March 1990 and again in August 
  1990, PMAC told its members that advertising in the calendar contravened the 
  Association&#146;s Code of Marketing Practices (the &#147;Code&#148;). This 
  direction was fatal to Reach&#146;s business. </p>
<p>[3] Reach sued PMAC and others for various economic torts, including intentional 
  interference with economic relations. The trial judge, Maloney J., found that 
  the letter PMAC sent to Reach&#146;s customers on March 28, 1990, wrongfully 
  interfered with Reach&#146;s economic relations. But the trial judge did not 
  award any damages for this tort. In his opinion, the March letter was cured 
  by PMAC&#146;s &#147;perfectly legitimate&#148; decision in August 1990 that 
  Reach&#146;s calendar did not comply with the Code. </p>
<p>[4] Reach appeals to this court only against PMAC. It asks that we find PMAC 
  liable in tort and that we direct a reference on damages. Reach seeks to hold 
  PMAC liable on either of two bases: first, PMAC did not have authority under 
  its Code - either in March 1990 or in August 1990 - to rule on whether its members 
  could advertise in the calendar; or second, PMAC&#146;s August decision could 
  not cure its previous unlawful act because the two were linked - the one would 
  not have happened without the other. </p>
<p>[5] Both bases of liability depend on showing that PMAC committed an unauthorized 
  act and that this act satisfied the elements of the tort of intentional interference 
  with economic relations.</p>
<p>[6] PMAC cross-appeals. It asks us to hold that the trial judge erred in concluding 
  Reach had made out the tort of intentional interference with Reach&#146;s economic 
  relations. PMAC submits that it did have authority under its Code to rule against 
  Herman M.D. PMAC also submits that it did not intend to injure Reach, that its 
  March 28, 1990, letter was not an illegal or unlawful act and that the letter 
  did not cause Reach to suffer economic loss. </p>
<p>[7] The appeal and the cross-appeal thus raise these four issues: </p>
<p class="indent">1. Did the Code authorize PMAC to direct its members to stop 
  advertising in Herman M.D;</p>
<p class="indent">2. If the answer to question 1 is no, was the Committee&#146;s 
  ruling in August 1990 a tortious act;</p>
<p class="indent">3. Did the trial judge err in concluding that sending the March 
  28, 1990, letter was a tortious act; and</p>
<p class="indent">4. If the answer to question 3 is no, did the trial judge err 
  in concluding that PMAC&#146;s decision in August 1990 cured its previous unlawful 
  act?</p>
<p>[8] I would answer these questions no, yes, no and no. I would therefore hold 
  that Reach has succeeded on its main ground of appeal: the Committee had no 
  jurisdiction under its Code to direct PMAC&#146;s members to stop advertising 
  in Herman M.D. I would direct a reference on damages limited to one year&#146;s 
  loss of profits. </p>
<p>B. Background Facts</p>
<p>
  [9] In 1988, Reach created a wall calendar containing Herman cartoons, drawn 
  by the Canadian cartoonist Jim Unger. Reach called the calendar &#147;Herman 
  M.D.&#148; because it featured Unger&#146;s Herman character in medical settings. 
</p>
<p>[10] Reach produced the first Herman M.D. for the 1989 calendar year. It published 
  the calendar both in English and in French. Drug manufacturers paid to insert 
  a two inch by nine inch advertisement at the bottom of a calendar page. Advertising 
  revenues for the first Herman M.D. exceeded $800,000. Reach distributed the 
  calendar free of charge to approximately 45,000 doctors and other health care 
  professionals across Canada. </p>
<p>[11] The calendar was well received. Reach received many letters of praise 
  and not a single complaint from the public. The trial judge also liked the calendar. 
  He found, &#147;It was attractive and it was popular. Certainly it appealed 
  to this court. It was seemingly harmless and obviously widely appreciated.&#148; 
</p>
<p>[12] During the time period that Reach launched Herman M.D., many pharmaceutical 
  companies distributed their own advertising products. For example Merck Frosst 
  Canada Inc., a PMAC member, had for a long time produced its own promotional 
  calendar called Dingbat. Other products included Post-it Notes, scratch pads, 
  hockey pucks, golf tees, pens, agendas, rulers and fridge magnets. Theses advertising 
  products distributed by the drug companies were known as &#147;service-oriented 
  items&#148;. </p>
<p>[13] In the mid to late 1980s, the increasing cost of prescription drugs in 
  Canada gave rise to criticism of the marketing practices of the pharmaceutical 
  industry. The practice of distributing service-oriented items especially came 
  under public scrutiny. Many viewed these items as frivolous. They increased 
  advertising costs - and thus the cost of medication - but did not add to the 
  doctors&#146; or patients&#146; knowledge about medical conditions or treatment. 
</p>
<p>[14] In the wake of this criticism and scrutiny, PMAC became concerned that 
  the government might attempt to regulate the prices and practices of its members. 
  To avoid this, PMAC adopted a self-regulatory scheme. In February 1988, it introduced 
  a revised Code. This Code targeted the marketing activities of PMAC members, 
  including the distribution of service-oriented items. </p>
<p>[15] A PMAC committee - the Marketing Practices Review Committee - administered 
  the Code. Article 12.1 of the Code authorized the Committee to review and adjudicate 
  written complaints concerning the marketing activities of PMAC members. Article 
  12.4 made adherence to the Committee&#146;s decisions a condition of continued 
  membership in PMAC. Article 10.1 - critical on this appeal - stipulated that 
  &#147;member companies shall refrain from distributing service-oriented items&#148;. 
</p>
<p>[16] In the summer and fall of 1989, the Committee ruled on a number of service-oriented 
  items distributed by member companies and decided that these &#147;single sponsored 
  items&#148; contravened the Code. Word then spread through the industry that 
  the Committee might begin to apply the Code to &#147;multi-sponsored items&#148;, 
  such as Herman M.D. The resulting uncertainty prompted Reach to ask the Committee 
  for clarification and for assurance that Herman M.D. would not be affected by 
  the Code. In a letter dated September 26, 1989, to Paul Lucas, chair of the 
  Committee, Reach noted that &#147;This is a grave matter affecting the viability 
  of our business.&#148; The letter continued,</p>
<p class="indent">Paul, I need a letter from you confirming your statement that 
  PMAC member companies may indeed advertise in the 1990 editions of Herman M.D. 
  while the P.M.A.C. continues its deliberations and search for guidelines that 
  can be applied fairly and equally to all service-oriented items. </p>
<p>[17] Lucas replied the same day. He wrote that the Committee had not yet decided 
  whether multi-sponsored service items contravened the Code &#147;because of 
  the far-reaching implications of such a decision on the companies selling these 
  vehicles&#148;. He assured Reach that even if the Committee eventually ruled 
  against it, PMAC members would not be prohibited from advertising in the 1990 
  Herman M.D. </p>
<p class="indent">The Code is currently undergoing review and this issue will be part of the 
  review process. This process will be complete by late 1989 or early 1990. In 
  the meantime it is recognized that the companies involved have closing dates 
  for their 1990 programs which are imminent and that that there is a high level 
  of uncertainty amongst P.M.A.C. companies as to whether they should participate. 
  The Marketing Practices Review Committee has agreed that pending a final decision 
  on this issue, existing programs with closing dates pre-January 1989 will not 
  be ruled in contravention of the Code during 1990 regardless of the decision. 
  Herman M.D. 1990 calendars have been included in this category. </p>
<p>[18] Lucas also told Reach that the Committee had not received any complaint 
  about Herman M.D. and that if it did receive one Reach would be given &#147;lots 
  of time to try and fix it&#148;. Lucas acknowledged in his testimony that PMAC 
  was concerned about the effect of the Committee&#146;s decisions on third-party 
  suppliers such as Reach. Although perhaps not &#147;a high priority item&#148;, 
  nonetheless, PMAC did not want to put these suppliers out of business. Instead 
  it began a dialogue with them. In November 1989, for example, PMAC&#146;s marketing 
  section met with Reach and other third-party suppliers to hear their concerns. 
  PMAC agreed to decide which items conformed to the spirit of the Code by July 
  1, 1990. </p>
<p>[19] With this reprieve, Reach&#146;s business surged. Companies who, months 
  earlier, had been reluctant to buy advertising space, now bought space in the 
  1990 Herman M.D. Between October 12 and December 20, 1989, Reach obtained 18 
  advertising contracts worth nearly half a million dollars. </p>
<p>[20] The reprieve was short-lived. In January 1990, the Committee ruled that 
  Merck Frosst&#146;s Dingbat calendar did not comply with the Code. In February 
  1990, Brian McLeod, the vice president of Merck Frosst and also the vice chair 
  of the Committee, filed a complaint against Herman M.D. He claimed that the 
  Committee had to rule consistently: if the Dingbat calendar contravened Article 
  10.1 of the Code, so too did Herman M.D. He outlined this concern in his letter 
  of complaint to Lucas. </p>
<p class="indent">I am aware that the Board is concerned that a ruling of non-compliance in a 
  &#147;third-party&#148; situation such as this potentially puts in jeopardy 
  the continued viability of publishers of the calendar as well as suppliers of 
  other promotional services. I share this concern; however, I would stress that 
  the Board has as its primary mandate to rule on the promotional activity in 
  question and not the way in which it is supplied. </p>
<p class="indent">In the case of these third-party situations, I recommend that the Board decide 
  and that all sponsors be advised, that such an activity is not in compliance 
  with the Code. At the same time, I would recommend that the Board institute 
  for these situations an exempt status. This exempt status would provide a two-year 
  period ending December 1991 in which companies could continue to advertise in 
  such third-party media without having this activity show in our reporting of 
  infractions. During this same period of time, the third-party suppliers would 
  have time to revise their promotional vehicles so that their services meet the 
  guidelines of the Code. </p>
<p class="indent">With such an action, the Board would be ruling in a consistent manner on all 
  promotional activities regardless of their method of production and distribution 
  and would be communicating clearly to all involved, that in the Board&#146;s 
  opinion, certain activities are not in compliance with the Code. </p>
<p>[21] The Committee met on March 20, 1989, and reviewed a number of complaints, 
  including that of Merck Frosst against Herman M.D. The trial judge found that 
  the Committee did not rule on the Merck Frosst complaint because there was no 
  evidence of such a ruling. </p>
<p>[22] On March 26, 1990, McLeod again wrote to Lucas undertaking that Merck 
  Frosst would no longer distribute the Dingbat calendar.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  He then added an important caveat: &#147;Inherent in this commitment is the 
  assumption that your Committee will reach the same ruling on all calendars, 
  irrespective of their method of production and distribution&#148;. </p>
<p>[23] Although this caveat seemed to confirm the trial judge&#146;s finding 
  that the Committee had not yet ruled on Herman M.D., on March 28, 1990, Lucas 
  wrote to each of Reach&#146;s advertisers to say that the Committee had decided 
  that &#147;sponsorship of service-oriented items, such as the Herman M.D. calendar&#148; 
  did not comply with Article 10 of the Code. </p>
<p class="indent">The Marketing Practices Review Committee is aware that your 
  Company is one of several PMAC members sponsoring the specialty 1990 Herman 
  M.D. calendars.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, we wish to advise that sponsorship of service-oriented 
  items, such as the Herman M.D. calendar, are not in compliance with Section 
  10 (Service-Oriented Items) of the PMAC Code of Marketing Practices.</p>
<p class="indent">We realize that plans for your sponsorship of the 1990 calendar 
  would have been made many months ago at which time your Company may not have 
  been in possession of full clarification with respect to acceptable service-oriented 
  items. That is why we wish to draw your attention to this matter well in advance 
  of the completion of your marketing plans for 1991.</p>
<p class="indent">Because such service-oriented items are not in compliance with 
  the Code, the Committee would be obliged, upon receipt of a written complaint, 
  to rule against any Company sponsoring such items in 1991. </p>
<p>[24] The trial judge found that &#147;absent a ruling by the Committee&#133; 
  what Lucas did on behalf of PMAC was an improper and unwarranted act&#148;. 
</p>
<p>[25] PMAC did not send a copy of this letter to Reach, but Reach later received 
  a copy from one of its customers. Between March and July 1990, the Committee 
  met with Reach&#146;s representatives to discuss revisions to the Herman M.D.</p>
<p>[26] Reach then redesigned its calendar to try to bring it into compliance 
  with the Code. Reach included information for doctors and patients on various 
  topics. It worked with various charities, including the Heart and Stroke Foundation 
  and the Canadian Cancer Society, to add educational content. The revised Herman 
  M.D. was approved by the Canadian Medical Association&#146;s Committee on Ethics. 
</p>
<p>[27] On August 23, 1990, Reach presented its redesigned calendar to the Committee. 
  However, McLeod, on behalf of the Committee, told Reach that its calendar still 
  did not comply with the Code. Thus, any PMAC member that advertised in the 1991 
  Herman M.D. would violate Article 10. In a letter dated September 7, 1990, the 
  Committee confirmed this advice.</p>
<p class="indent">The Committee took careful note of the measures taken by Reach 
  M.D. to make the calendar a more relevant and informative vehicle. In particular, 
  we were impressed with your efforts in dialoguing with various disease-specific 
  organizations to develop the counselling information which has been incorporated 
  in the calendar.</p>
<p class="indent">Notwithstanding, I must advise that, after careful consideration, 
  the Committee concluded that the primary function of the vehicle is that of 
  a calendar. Accordingly, it was the unanimous decision of the Committee that 
  the Herman M.D. calendar, as presented to us during the meeting, does not comply 
  with Section 10 of the PMAC Code of Marketing Practices. Consequently, if any 
  PMAC member advertises in the calendar as currently formatted, and a written 
  complaint is received by the Committee, it is the opinion of the Committee that 
  the Company in question would be found to be in contravention of the Code [emphasis 
  in original]. </p>
<p>[28] The Committee&#146;s determinations in March and then in August 1990 spelled 
  the demise of the Herman M.D. calendar. For the 1991 calendar, advertising revenues 
  plummeted to around $200,000. Reach floundered until 1993, when it stopped production 
  of the calendar. </p>
<p>C. Analysis</p>
<p>
  First issue: Did the Code authorize PMAC to direct its members to stop advertising 
  in Herman M.D.? </p>
<p>[29] The trial judge held that PMAC had committed the tort of intentional interference 
  with Reach&#146;s economic relations. He so held because he found that Lucas&#146; 
  March 28, 1990 letter was an unlawful act. It was an unlawful act because the 
  Committee had not ruled on whether PMAC members who advertised in Herman M.D. 
  would violate the Code. Conversely, the trial judge found that the ruling in 
  August was &#147;perfectly legitimate&#148; because that ruling had been made 
  by the Committee. </p>
<p>[30] The trial judge did not expressly consider whether the prohibition in 
  Article 10.1 was broad enough to cover members&#146; advertising in service-oriented 
  items produced and distributed by non-members, such as Reach. But his findings 
  implicitly assumed that Article 10.1 did cover these multi-sponsored items. 
  PMAC, of course, supports the trial judge&#146;s position on the scope of Article 
  10.1.</p>
<p>[31] Reach&#146;s main submission on this appeal is that Article 10.1 did not 
  clothe the Committee with jurisdiction to prohibit members of PMAC from advertising 
  in Herman M.D. Article 10.1 prohibited members of PMAC from distributing their 
  own service-oriented items. It did not prohibit members from advertising in 
  service-oriented items produced and distributed by non-members. Thus, Reach 
  submits that PMAC had no authority to rule against Herman M.D.: the Committee&#146;s 
  August ruling was not authorized and, had it ruled in March, that ruling too 
  would not have been authorized. I agree with this submission. </p>
<p>[32] Reach&#146;s submission should be viewed in the context of two general 
  principles concerning court review of the actions of a voluntary trade association. 
  First, where the association exercises authority beyond the scope of its own 
  rules, a court can set aside a decision for lack of jurisdiction. Second, however, 
  an association&#146;s rules and regulations should be interpreted broadly: only 
  where the association has clearly exceeded its authority should the court intervene. 
  PMAC&#146;s Code emphasized this second principle in Article 1, which stipulated, 
  &#147;Observance of the PMAC Code of Marketing Practices is to be in spirit, 
  as well as in letter&#148;.</p>
<p>[33] Both principles were discussed by Steele J. in MacDonald v. Windsor-Essex 
  County Real Estate Board (1982), 38 O.R. (2d) 589 (H.C.) at 592.</p>
<p class="indent">A private body such as the defendant should be allowed great flexibility in 
  interpreting its own by-laws and rules and regulations to which members have 
  contracted to be bound. The courts should only interfere where it is obvious 
  the body has clearly not exercised power within such laws and regulations. Having 
  contracted with its member to adhere to its own rules and regulations it cannot 
  purport to exercise power outside them.</p>
<p>[34] In this case, the article of the Code that must be interpreted is 10.1. 
  As originally drafted in February 1988, Article 10.1 provided: </p>
<p class="indent">10. Service-Oriented Items</p>
<p class="indent">10.1 Member companies shall refrain from distributing service-oriented 
  items and from conducting &#147;special promotions&#148; which cannot be justified 
  if subjected to professional and public scrutiny.</p>
<p>[35] Article 10.3 contemplated that PMAC would publish guidelines on acceptable 
  criteria for service-oriented items. It did so in November 1989. These guidelines 
  established a checklist for determining whether a service-oriented item could 
  &#147;withstand professional and public scrutiny&#148;. </p>
<p class="indent">General Principle</p>
<p class="indent">Member companies shall refrain from distributing service-oriented 
  items and from conducting &#147;special promotions&#148; which cannot be justified 
  if subjected to professional and public scrutiny.</p>
<p class="indent">The following checklist was developed by the Marketing Section 
  in an attempt to establish acceptable criteria for service-oriented items. If 
  member companies can answer YES to the following questions, the service-oriented 
  item should be able to withstand professional and public scrutiny.</p>
<p class="indent">Is the item in question: </p>
<p class="indent">1) Of value/utility to the healthcare professional?</p>
<p class="indent">2) Not commercially/readily available to the healthcare professional?</p>
<p class="indent">3) Of minimal commercial or real value?</p>
<p class="indent">4) Designed to facilitate patient/healthcare professional understanding 
  of a condition?</p>
<p class="indent">If each of the foregoing is answered in the affirmative, the 
  final assessment rests in determining whether or not, in your opinion, the service-oriented 
  item has a high potential to draw criticism from either healthcare professionals 
  or the lay public. </p>
<p>[36] Even after it had been redesigned the Herman M.D. did not satisfy this 
  checklist. Question 4, in particular, was not met. Had a member of PMAC published 
  and distributed the 1990 or the 1991 Herman M.D., that member would have violated 
  Article 10.1 of the Code. Further, had the member contracted out the publishing 
  and distribution to a third-party, the member would still have violated Article 
  10.1. Such an arrangement would at least violate the spirit of the Code, if 
  not the letter. </p>
<p>[37] But that is not what happened here. No member of PMAC, either directly 
  or through a third-party, distributed Herman M.D. Instead, members of PMAC bought 
  advertising space in Reach&#146;s wall calendar. &#147;Distributing&#148; ordinarily 
  means &#147;dealing out&#148; or delivering items to people: The New Shorter 
  Oxford English Dictionary, (Thumb Index ed.) p. 709; Black&#146;s Law Dictionary, 
  7th ed. p. 487. No matter how broadly the word &#147;distributing&#148; is interpreted, 
  its meaning here cannot be extended to include merely advertising. Indeed, advertising 
  is dealt with separately in the Code in Article 2. </p>
<p>[38] Any doubt that the prohibition in Article 10.1 did not include advertising 
  in service-oriented items distributed by non-members of PMAC was put to rest 
  by the May 1990 amendment to that Article. The amendment added a critical second 
  sentence to Article 10.1, so that the entire Article then provided: </p>
<p class="indent">10. Service-Oriented Items</p>
<p class="indent">10.1 General Principle</p>
<p class="indent">Member companies shall refrain from distributing service-oriented 
  items and from conducting &#147;special promotions&#148; which cannot be justified 
  if subjected to professional and public scrutiny. Member companies are also 
  encouraged to use judgement in selecting advertising vehicles which may not 
  be consistent with this general principle [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>[39] The second sentence was directed to those members who were considering 
  advertising in a service-oriented item such as Herman M.D. And although the 
  sentence cautions members to use their judgment, those who did choose to advertise 
  would not contravene Article 10.1, and, therefore, would not be subject to the 
  Code&#146;s sanctions, including loss of membership in PMAC. </p>
<p>[40] Undoubtedly, as Reach acknowledged, PMAC could have drafted Article 10.1 
  more broadly to prohibit members from advertising in service-oriented items, 
  such as Herman M.D., which did not meet the Association&#146;s guidelines. It 
  simply did not do so. The Committee, therefore, had no authority to rule as 
  it did in August 1990 that advertising in Herman M.D. would contravene the Code. 
</p>
<p>[41] PMAC advances a secondary position in defence of the judgment at trial. 
  Even if Article 10.1 was not broad enough to prohibit advertising in Reach&#146;s 
  calendar, PMAC contends that the Committee did not rule or decide against Herman 
  M.D. in August 1990. Instead, it just gave an advisory opinion for future guidance. 
  PMAC points out that the Committee made decisions under Article 10.1 in response 
  to formal complaints. Yet, the Committee&#146;s August opinion did not result 
  from a complaint, but from a process Reach voluntarily participated in to address 
  the Committee&#146;s concerns about its calendar. </p>
<p>[42] I do not accept PMAC&#146;s contention for three reasons. First, it is 
  contrary to the position PMAC took at trial, a position that was accepted by 
  the trial judge. At trial PMAC insisted that in August 1990, the Committee made 
  a ruling under Article 10.1 that it was authorized to make. Second, whether 
  called a decision or an opinion, the adverse effect on Reach was identical. 
  The Committee signalled that its members who advertised in Herman M.D. would 
  contravene Article 10.1. Third, the August ruling may fairly be seen as a decision 
  on Herman M.D., which was precipitated by Merck Frosst&#146;s complaint in February 
  1990. </p>
<p>[43] I conclude, therefore, that the Code did not authorize PMAC to direct 
  its members to stop advertising in Herman M.D., and that in so ruling in August 
  1990, the Committee acted beyond its jurisdiction. </p>
<p>Second issue: Was the Committee&#146;s ruling in August 1990 a tortious act?</p>
<p>[44] Reach cannot succeed on its main ground of appeal merely by showing that 
  the Committee&#146;s August 1990 ruling was unauthorized. Instead, it must show 
  that this ruling amounted to the tort of intentional interference with economic 
  relations. To establish this tort, Reach must prove three elements: </p>
<p class="indent">i) PMAC intended to injure Reach;</p>
<p class="indent">ii) PMAC interfered with Reach&#146;s business by illegal or 
  unlawful means; and</p>
<p class="indent">iii) As a result of the interference Reach suffered economic 
  loss.</p>
<p>See Lineal Group Inc. v. Atlantis Canadian Distributors Inc. (1998), 42 O.R. 
  (3d) 157 (C.A.).</p>
<p>[45] As I will discuss, the trial judge concluded that Reach made out these 
  elements of the tort in connection with Lucas&#146; unauthorized March 1990 
  letter. Equally, I conclude that Reach has satisfied the elements of the tort 
  in connection with the Committee&#146;s unauthorized August 1990 ruling. </p>
<p>[46] To satisfy the first element, Reach need not prove that PMAC&#146;s predominant 
  purpose was to injure it. This first element of the tort will be met as long 
  as PMAC&#146;s unlawful act was in some measure directed against Reach. That 
  is so even if - as PMAC claims - its predominant purpose was to advance its 
  own interest and those of its members. In short, &#147;The defendant&#146;s 
  manoeuvre must have been targeted against the plaintiff, although its predominant 
  purpose might well have been to advance his own interests thereby rather than 
  to injure the plaintiff&#148;. See John G. Fleming, The Law of Torts, 9th ed., 
  (1998) at p. 769.</p>
<p>[47] The trial judge found that PMAC targeted Reach when Lucas sent his letter 
  to PMAC members in March 1990. Similarly, the Committee&#146;s August 1990 ruling 
  targeted Reach and its Herman M.D. calendar. Even though PMAC may have acted 
  to protect its members, its ruling was in some measure directed against Reach. 
  Indeed the trial judge found at para. 23, &#147;PMAC was clearly aware of the 
  current and potential effects of its efforts on third parties such as the plaintiff&#148;. 
  PMAC recognized these effects when, in September 1989, it decided not to black-list 
  the 1990 Herman M.D. The Committee must also have recognized these effects when 
  it ruled in August 1990. On all the evidence, I see no other reasonable inference. 
  See Lonhro plc. v. Fayed, [1989] 2 All E.R. 65 (C.A.), and Daishowa Inc. v. 
  Friends of the Lubicon (1996), 27 O.R. (3d) 215 (Div. Ct.). </p>
<p>[48] The second element of the tort - that PMAC interfered with Reach&#146;s 
  business by illegal or unlawful means - on the facts of this case is the most 
  contentious element. Unquestionably, the Committee&#146;s August 1990 ruling 
  interfered with Reach&#146;s business, but did this ruling satisfy the &#147;illegal 
  or unlawful means&#148; branch of the tort? </p>
<p>[49] The case law reflects two different views of &#147;illegal or unlawful 
  means&#148;, one narrow, the other broad. The narrow view confines illegal or 
  unlawful means to an act prohibited by law or by statute. See Dunlop v. Woollahra 
  Municipal Council, [1981] 1 All E.R. 1202 (P.C.). Though unauthorized, the Committee&#146;s 
  August 1990 ruling was not prohibited either by law or by statute. </p>
<p>[50] The broader view, however, extends illegal or unlawful means to an act 
  the defendant &#147;is not at liberty to commit&#148; - in other words, an act 
  without legal justification. Lord Denning espoused this broader view in Torquay 
  Hotel Co. Ltd. v. Cousins, [1969] 1 All E.R. 522 at 530 (C.A.): </p>
<p class="indent">I must say a word about unlawful means, because that brings in another principle. 
  I have always understood that if one person deliberately interferes with the 
  trade or business of another, and does so by unlawful means, that is, by an 
  act which he is not at liberty to commit, then he is acting unlawfully, even 
  though he does not procure or induce any actual breach of contract. If the means 
  are unlawful, that is enough. </p>
<p>[51] The trial judge adopted the principle in Torquay Hotel in finding that 
  Lucas&#146; March 28 letter was &#147;an improper and unwarranted act&#148; 
  that satisfied the second element of the tort. Several Canadian appellate courts 
  have taken the same view. For example, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal applied 
  this principle in finding a franchisor liable for unlawful interference with 
  economic interests because of its unauthorized instruction to a franchisee&#146;s 
  bank not to honour certain cheques. See Volkswagen Canada Ltd. v. Spicer (1978), 
  91 D.L.R. (3d) 42 (N.S.S.C. App. Div.). See also United Food &amp; Commercial 
  Workers Local 1252 v. Cashin, [1996] N.J. No. 343, aff&#146;d [2002] N.J. No. 
  223 (Nfld. C.A.) and No. 1 Collision Repair and Painting (1982) Ltd. v. Insurance 
  Corp. of British Columbia, [2000] B.C.J. No. 1634 per Lambert J.A. dissenting. 
</p>
<p>[52] I think that the trial judge was right to take a broader view of illegal 
  or unlawful means. It is, however, unnecessary to decide the outer limits of 
  the principle in Torquay Hotel. Unlawful means at least include what occurred 
  here: the Committee made a ruling that it was not authorized to make. Its ruling 
  was beyond its powers. I see no policy reasons for taking a narrower view of 
  unlawful means. Indeed, to do so would preclude redress against organizations 
  like PMAC and others for any number of unauthorized acts that on a common sense 
  view would be considered unlawful, but nonetheless, were not prohibited by law 
  or by statute. </p>
<p>[53] Taking this broader view of unlawful means, I conclude that the Committee&#146;s 
  August 1990 ruling was an act PMAC &#147;was not at liberty to commit&#148;. 
  Reach has, thus, met the second element of the tort of intentional interference 
  with economic relations. It has shown that PMAC interfered with its business 
  by unlawful means. </p>
<p>[54] Reach has also satisfied the third element of the tort. As a result of 
  PMAC&#146;s interference, Reach obviously suffered economic loss. The Committee&#146;s 
  August ruling caused Reach&#146;s advertising sales to plummet. Within a couple 
  of years, Herman M.D. could no longer survive. I therefore conclude that because 
  of the Committee&#146;s August 1990 ruling, PMAC is liable to Reach for the 
  tort of intentional interference with economic relations. </p>
<p>Third issue: Did the trial judge err in concluding that sending of March 28, 
  1990 letter was a tortious act?</p>
<p>[55] Although I would allow Reach&#146;s appeal on its main submission, I will 
  also address its alternative submission. Its alternative submission advances 
  an entirely different theory of liability. This theory accepts the trial judge&#146;s 
  implicit conclusion that Article 10.1 of the Code prohibited PMAC members from 
  advertising in promotional items such as Herman M.D. Nevertheless, Reach contends 
  that but for PMAC&#146;s unauthorized act in March 1990, it would not have ruled 
  against Herman M.D. in August. </p>
<p>[56] Therefore, Reach&#146;s alternative submission depends on upholding the 
  trial judge&#146;s finding that Lucas&#146; March 28, 1990 letter was a tortious 
  act, and on setting aside the trial judge&#146;s later finding that the Committee&#146;s 
  decision in August 1990 cured this earlier tort. Here I deal with whether the 
  trial judge erred in finding that PMAC intentionally interfered with Reach&#146;s 
  economic relations by sending the March 28, 1990 letter to its members. Largely 
  for the reasons I have already discussed, I conclude that he did not err. </p>
<p>[57] However, the third element of the tort - economic loss flowing from the 
  unlawful interference - requires separate consideration. That Reach suffered 
  economic loss because of the Committee&#146;s August ruling was abundantly evident 
  from the financial data in the record. But PMAC submits that Reach suffered 
  no loss flowing from Lucas&#146; March letter because of the nature of the calendar 
  business. That business is mainly a six-month business. Typically, advertising 
  contracts for a given year&#146;s calendar are concluded between July and December 
  of the previous year. PMAC, therefore, contends that Reach suffered no loss 
  between March 1990 and the Committee&#146;s decision in August.</p>
<p>[58] The trial judge concluded at para. 46, &#147;there can be no dispute that 
  the plaintiff has suffered economic loss, and has therefore met step three&#148;. 
  He found that &#147;almost immediately&#148; after Lucas&#146; letter &#147;virtually 
  all of the plaintiff&#146;s customers ceased doing business with it.&#148; He 
  did not, however, explain why this was due to the letter in March rather than 
  the Committee&#146;s ruling in August. Moreover, the evidence of any loss of 
  advertising contracts between March and August is sketchy. At the very least, 
  however, Reach suffered a loss of goodwill because of Lucas&#146; letter. That 
  loss of goodwill suffices to meet the third element of the tort. I find no error 
  in the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that PMAC committed a tortious act in March 
  1990. </p>
<p>Fourth issue: Did the trial judge err in concluding that PMAC&#146;s decision 
  in August 1990 cured its previous unlawful act?</p>
<p>[59] The trial judge did not award damages for PMAC&#146;s tortious March 28, 
  1990 letter because in his view the Committee&#146;s &#147;perfectly legitimate&#148; 
  ruling in August that the Herman M.D. did not comply with the Code &#147;accomplished 
  the same effect and created the same result&#148;. Regardless of what occurred 
  in March, the ruling in August would inevitably, and did, prompt advertisers 
  to withdraw their support for the 1991 calendar. </p>
<p>[60] Reach submits that the trial judge erred in concluding that the August 
  ruling &#147;cured&#148; the March tort. Reach contends that the trial judge 
  erroneously viewed the March ruling and the August decision as unrelated events. 
  Instead, Reach says that they were inextricably linked. To hold that Herman 
  M.D. would have been ruled against in August without the letter in March is, 
  Reach says, entirely speculative. I do not agree. </p>
<p>[61] I suppose that the trial judge could have adopted Reach&#146;s position. 
  But the standard of appellate review comes into play. The trial judge effectively, 
  if not expressly, found that even if nothing had happened in March, PMAC would 
  still have ruled against Reach&#146;s calendar in August. That finding is a 
  finding of fact. It is entitled to deference from this court. The evidence in 
  the record and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence 
  amply support the trial judge&#146;s finding. </p>
<ul>
  <li>By the fall of 1989, there was a &#147;buzz&#148; in the industry about 
    the fate of multi-sponsored items. Indeed by then the Committee had already 
    discussed whether Herman M.D. complied with the Code. </li>
  <li>Reach knew about these discussions and knew by late September 1989 that 
    PMAC had serious concerns about whether Herman M.D. violated at least the 
    spirit of the Code. </li>
  <li>PMAC then asked Reach and other third-party suppliers to submit their products 
    for the Committee&#146;s consideration. Lucas, the chair of the Committee, 
    told Reach and others that they would know the Committee&#146;s positions 
    by the summer of 1990, and thus, well before publication of the 1991 calendar. 
  </li>
  <li>After the Committee ruled against the Dingbat calendar in February 1990, 
    Merck Frosst complained about PMAC members advertising in Herman M.D. The 
    Committee had a mandate to investigate and rule on this complaint. Even if 
    it did not rule on Merck Frosst&#146;s complaint in March, likely it would 
    have done so soon after. </li>
  <li>Thus, it is a fair inference that even if Lucas had never sent his letter 
    in March, the dialogue between Reach and the Committee over changes to Herman 
    M.D. would still have occurred. That dialogue led directly to the August ruling. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>[62] In the light of these considerations, the trial judge&#146;s finding that 
  the August ruling cured the March tort is reasonable. Therefore, I would not 
  give effect to Reach&#146;s alternative theory of liability. </p>
<p>D. Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [63] I would allow Reach&#146;s appeal and set aside the trial judge&#146;s 
  order. I would declare that the Article 10.1 of the Code of Marketing Practices 
  did not authorize PMAC to direct its members to stop advertising in Herman M.D. 
  I would find that because of its August 1990 ruling, PMAC is liable to Reach 
  in tort for intentionally interfering with Reach&#146;s economic relations. 
  I would dismiss PMAC&#146;s cross-appeal. </p>
<p>[64] The trial judge did not assess damages. Part of the trial record is missing, 
  thus preventing this court from making its own assessment. I would, therefore, 
  direct a reference on Reach&#146;s damages. However, I would limit those damages 
  to loss of profits for the 1991 calendar. I impose a one-year limit on Reach&#146;s 
  damages because, as even Reach acknowledges, PMAC could have drafted Article 
  10.1 of the Code broadly enough to prohibit its members from advertising in 
  multi-sponsored items such as Herman M.D. Had PMAC been told in August 1990 
  that its Code did not authorize the Committee&#146;s ruling, one can reasonably 
  conclude PMAC would have amended its Code to prohibit its members from advertising 
  in the 1992 Herman M.D. </p>
<p>[65] Finally, the parties may make written submissions on the costs of the 
  trial and of the appeal. In accordance with this court&#146;s practice direction, 
  the submission on the costs of the appeal should include a bill of costs and 
  a proposed amount. </p>
