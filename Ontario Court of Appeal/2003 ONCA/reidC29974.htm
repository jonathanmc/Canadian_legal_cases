<p>On appeal from conviction for second degree murder by Justice Paul Hermiston 
  of the Superior Court of Justice, and a jury, on May 8, 1997 and from the sentence 
  of life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for fifteen years imposed 
  on May 21, 1997.</p>
<p>MOLDAVER J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] On May 6, 1997, after trial before Justice Paul Hermiston and jury, the 
  appellant was convicted of second degree murder. On May 21, 1997, he was sentenced 
  to life imprisonment and his period of parole ineligibility was increased from 
  ten to fifteen years. The appellant appeals from both conviction and sentence. 
  If successful on his conviction appeal, he seeks a new trial. If the conviction 
  appeal fails, he seeks a reduction in the period of his parole ineligibility.</p>
<p>
  [2] For reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction. With 
  respect to sentence, I would allow the appeal and reduce the period of parole 
  ineligibility from fifteen to twelve years.</p>
<p>
  OVERVIEW</p>
<p>[3] In the early morning hours of June 28, 1995, the appellant killed Daniel 
  Parker. He did so by first striking Parker over the head with a hammer, causing 
  his skull to fracture, and then by stabbing him 20 times in the chest, back 
  and abdomen with a knife. Of the 20 knife wounds, 8 penetrated Parker's chest 
  and 7 were directed into his back. Parker died from loss of blood. Indeed, when 
  found at the scene by the police and ambulance personnel a short time after 
  the stabbing, he was literally soaked in blood, so much so that his clothing 
  was of no evidentiary value to the forensic blood spatter analyst.</p>
<p>
  [4] The pathologist who performed the autopsy found but a single defensive wound 
  on Parker's entire body. It was a blunt force injury to his forearm and according 
  to the pathologist, it almost certainly occurred when Parker was trying to cover 
  his face or chest. Of particular note, the pathologist found no defensive wounds 
  linked to the knife attack. </p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant did not deny responsibility for the various injuries. On the 
  contrary, he readily admitted that he caused them but claimed that they were 
  inflicted in the course of a life and death struggle with the deceased. His 
  sole defence at trial was self-defence. Manslaughter was left to the jury on 
  the basis of lack of intent but, given the nature and extent of the injuries 
  to the deceased and the appellant's admission that he was aware that the force 
  he was using could cause death or serious injury, it was hardly a viable option. 
  Manslaughter on the basis of provocation was not left to the jury. Defence counsel 
  at trial (not Mr. Litkowski) acknowledged that the evidence did not support 
  that defence and the appellant does not suggest otherwise on appeal.</p>
<p>
  The Case for Self-defence</p>
<p>[6] The appellant's claim to self-defence rested essentially on his own evidence. 
  He testified that on the night in question, after spending the day and evening 
  with his friend Joan Snider, he returned to his room at Joan Glover's apartment 
  and went to bed. He recounted how, earlier that evening, he and Ms. Snider had 
  run into Parker and Ms. Glover and that Ms. Snider and Ms. Glover had engaged 
  in a heated argument about Parker's assaultive behaviour towards women. The 
  appellant had not met Parker previously and by all accounts, he and Parker did 
  not have a problem with each other at that time.</p>
<p>
  [7] Joan Glover and the appellant had known each other for many years. From 
  1989 to the summer of 1994, they were involved in a long-term relationship. 
  More will be said about the nature of their relationship in due course. For 
  the moment, it is common ground that at the time of the homicide, Ms. Glover 
  was allowing the appellant to use the second bedroom in her apartment until 
  he could get back on his feet. From her perspective, the romantic aspect of 
  their relationship was over. </p>
<p>
  [8] According to the appellant, after returning home from his evening with Ms. 
  Snider, he went to bed and as he was falling asleep, he heard the apartment 
  door open. A few moments later, Ms. Glover opened his bedroom door. Their eyes 
  met and she closed the door. He then heard her say &quot;Oh, he is here&quot;. 
  A male voice then responded &quot;the sooner we're rid of this bastard, the 
  better&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [9] That remark made the appellant very nervous. He put on his shorts and went 
  out into the hallway. He saw Parker and told him to &quot;get the fuck out of 
  here&quot;. Parker then came at him. Parker was holding a hammer in his right 
  hand. As Parker was about to hit him with the hammer, the appellant caught Parker's 
  wrist and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, a door opened and the appellant 
  heard Ms. Glover scream &quot;stop it, stop it&quot;. He then heard the front 
  door open with a bang. </p>
<p>
  [10] The struggle continued and, in the course of it, the appellant acknowledged 
  that the hammer may have bounced off Parker's head a few times. Eventually, 
  he was able to wrestle the hammer from Parker's grip and, with both hands, he 
  struck Parker &quot;quite hard&quot; on the top of his head. Parker then fell 
  backwards and the appellant let go of the hammer. In cross-examination, he agreed 
  that he not only dropped the hammer but that he pushed it away from himself 
  towards Parker.</p>
<p>
  [11] According to the appellant, moments later Parker was up again attacking 
  him with the hammer. The appellant quickly retreated to his room and retrieved 
  a knife from his toolbox. With the knife in his left hand, he returned to the 
  hall to confront Parker. Parker immediately swung the hammer at him. The appellant 
  caught it with his right hand and the two struggled over it once again. Fearing 
  that Parker was gaining the upper hand, the appellant stabbed him in the side 
  with the knife. According to the appellant, Parker flinched at this point and 
  said &quot;Oh, a knife, eh?&quot; He then renewed his attack on the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [12] On the first knife thrust, the knife got stuck in Parker's body and the 
  appellant lost control of it momentarily. Upon retrieving it, he plunged it 
  repeatedly into Parker's right side. He had no idea how many times this occurred. 
  He was in a state of panic at the time and he was terrified that he would lose 
  his own life.</p>
<p>
  [13] Eventually, Parker began to sway on his feet and his blood splashed onto 
  the hardwood floor. Parker then raised his free hand, admitted defeat, and fell 
  on the appellant with all his weight. The appellant then backed him down the 
  hallway into the living room and let go of him. Parker fell to the floor in 
  the living room. That is where he was found shortly afterwards by police and 
  ambulance personnel. He was lying face down in a pool of his own blood. Some 
  of the personnel observed a hammer under his body near his right hand, others 
  claimed that he was actually clutching it in his right hand. Ironically, Parker's 
  parents testified that their son was left-handed and that several years earlier, 
  he had lost two fingers on his right hand. A photograph confirming the loss 
  of the two fingers was made an exhibit at trial. </p>
<p>
  [14] Following Parker's collapse, the appellant went to his room to retrieve 
  his cigarettes, lighter, watch and keys. He then called the police and an ambulance. 
  When the police arrived, he took every opportunity to insist that he had acted 
  throughout in self-defence. </p>
<p>
  The Case Against Self-defence</p>
<p>[15] Apart from a small amount of direct evidence from the witness Joan Glover, 
  the case against self-defence rested on a compelling body of circumstantial 
  evidence. More will be said about the direct evidence of Ms. Glover in due course. 
  For the moment, suffice it to say that her evidence and the evidence surrounding 
  it gives rise to the appellant's primary ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [16] As indicated, the case against self-defence rested on a compelling body 
  of circumstantial evidence that told a much different story from the one told 
  by the appellant. Far from confirming his version of a life and death struggle, 
  it painted a picture of a one-sided onslaught. </p>
<p>
  [17] As I have already pointed out, the deceased suffered massive injuries to 
  his skull and upper body. And yet, apart from one blunt force defensive wound 
  on his forearm, no other defensive wounds were located. The lack of defensive 
  wounds is telling, especially in relation to the knife attack. It supports the 
  inference that before the knife attack, the deceased was in a weakened and vulnerable 
  state from his head injuries and virtually incapable of defending himself. The 
  force of that inference is strengthened by the lack of injuries to the appellant. 
  Apart from a scrape on his shin, no other recent injuries were detected. A yellowish 
  discoloration on his forehead, visible in a photograph taken shortly after the 
  event, was said by the pathologist to be &quot;three to four weeks old&quot;. 
  His opinion did not coincide with the appellant's claim that he had received 
  a &quot;glancing blow&quot; to his head from the hammer. According to the pathologist, 
  had the appellant received such a blow, he would have had a mark on his forehead 
  unless he had been hit &quot;absolutely dead flat&quot;. The appellant's &quot;glancing 
  blow&quot; injury was called into further question by a police officer who testified 
  that shortly after the appellant's arrest, he touched the appellant's forehead 
  and felt no swelling.</p>
<p>
  [18] In sum, to the extent that the appellant received any injuries, they hardly 
  attested to the &quot;life and death&quot; struggle he described. </p>
<p>
  [19] That is not to say that the appellant did not do his best to convince others 
  that the deceased had attacked him in a life-threatening manner. For example, 
  although he denied it, his friend Ms. Snider testified that after his arrest, 
  the appellant told her that Parker had attacked him and hit him repeatedly on 
  his side with a hammer. The appellant made no mention of that at the time of 
  his arrest and no injuries to his side were noticed. According to the pathologist, 
  had the appellant received repeated blows to his side from a hammer, bruising 
  and swelling would have been observable and the appellant might also have sustained 
  bruised or fractured ribs. </p>
<p>
  [20] Other aspects of the appellant's testimony did not hold up against the 
  circumstantial and forensic evidence. By way of illustration, the appellant's 
  evidence that the deceased collapsed on him at the end of the knife attack was 
  irreconcilable with the small amount of blood found on the appellant's clothing. 
  Likewise, the appellant's testimony that Parker was holding the hammer in his 
  right hand did not accord with the evidence that Parker was left-handed and 
  that he was missing two fingers on his right hand. In turn, that called into 
  question the finding of the hammer in or near Parker's right hand and gave rise 
  to an inference that the appellant planted it there after the event. That inference 
  is supported by the appellant's testimony that after the deceased collapsed 
  on him in the hallway, he backed the deceased into the living room before letting 
  go. On that scenario, unless the deceased was somehow able to keep hold of the 
  hammer after collapsing, the hammer should have been found in the hallway. The 
  fact that it was not supports the inference that the appellant placed it underneath 
  the deceased after he had collapsed on the living room floor; so too does the 
  appellant's comment to the police after his arrest that &quot;he may have moved 
  the hammer&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [21] Other internal and external inconsistencies in the appellant's testimony 
  also call into question the veracity of his evidence. The following three examples 
  are offered by way of illustration. </p>
<p>
  [22] First, in his testimony at trial, the appellant claimed that Parker attacked 
  him in the hallway after he had come out of his bedroom. And yet, in a post-arrest 
  statement to the police (which the appellant denied), he reported that Parker 
  had attacked him while he was lying in bed. </p>
<p>
  [23] Second, in his testimony in-chief, the appellant claimed that he was not 
  aware that his defensive actions would kill Parker. In cross-examination, he 
  backed away from that claim and admitted to knowing that Parker could die, both 
  from being struck over the head with a hammer and from the knife attack. </p>
<p>
  [24] Third, the hammer that was found under Parker belonged to the appellant. 
  Normally, the appellant kept it in his room or car. At trial, in an effort to 
  explain how Parker had obtained it without entering his room, he testified that 
  he had loaned it to Ms. Glover. He conceded however that in his statement to 
  the police, he did not make mention of this. In addition, Ms. Glover testified 
  that she had three hammers of her own and she was not asked in cross-examination 
  whether she had borrowed a hammer from the appellant and if so, why. </p>
<p>
  [25] It is against this backdrop that I turn to the direct evidence of Joan 
  Glover and the legal issues surrounding it.</p>
<p>
  Direct Evidence of Joan Glover</p>
<p>
  [26] Ms. Glover testified that when she and Parker returned to her apartment, 
  she opened the appellant's bedroom door and observed the appellant in bed. Contrary 
  to the appellant's evidence, she denied making eye contact with him. She did 
  agree that before closing his door, she may have said &quot;Oh, he is here&quot;. 
  </p>
<p>
  [27] Ms. Glover then went to the washroom and while there, she heard a loud 
  bang, following which she heard the appellant say &quot;get the fuck out of 
  here&quot;. That aspect of her evidence did not conform with her testimony at 
  the preliminary hearing in which she stated that she heard an unrecognizable 
  voice say &quot;what the fuck are you doing&quot;? </p>
<p>
  [28] In her trial testimony, Ms. Glover stated that after hearing the loud bang 
  and the words spoken by the appellant, she left the bathroom and saw the appellant 
  with a hammer in his left hand. He and Parker were standing apart and she saw 
  the appellant hit Parker with the hammer. Parker remained standing and the two 
  men started to struggle. Parker was attempting to grab the hammer but the appellant 
  had the upper hand.</p>
<p>
  [29] Once again, that aspect of her evidence did not accord with what she had 
  told the police in her statement of June 28, nor did it accord with her evidence 
  at the preliminary hearing. In neither instance had she mentioned that the appellant 
  had a hammer or that he had hit Parker with it. As well, in both instances, 
  she stated that she did not know who had the upper hand. </p>
<p>
  [30] At trial, Ms. Glover testified that when she saw the men begin to struggle, 
  she tried to pull the appellant away from Parker but she was unable to do so. 
  She then fled the apartment and ran to the superintendent's apartment where 
  she called the police. She agreed that, in total, she had witnessed five to 
  ten seconds of the fight.</p>
<p>
  [31] The inconsistencies in Ms. Glover's testimony came as no surprise to the 
  Crown or the defence. Prior to trial, Ms. Glover had provided the police with 
  the additional information that formed the basis of her trial testimony, information 
  that she had not disclosed in her June 28 statement to the police nor in her 
  evidence at the preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>
  [32] Once in possession of the additional information, Crown counsel made it 
  available to the defence. Thus, prior to commencing the trial, both sides knew 
  that Ms. Glover's description of the event was likely to differ from what she 
  had initially told the police and confirmed at the preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>
  [33] In accordance with its continuing disclosure obligations, the Crown also 
  advised the defence that Ms. Glover had an explanation for the inconsistencies. 
  In short, the defence was told that if asked, she would testify that her initial 
  failure to fully disclose what she had observed and heard was due to a number 
  of factors (the effects of which she had not appreciated at the time) including 
  her fear of the appellant, her mistrust of the system, and feelings of shock, 
  trauma and denial occasioned by the event itself.</p>
<p>
  [34] Beginning with her fear of the appellant and her mistrust of the system, 
  the defence was told that in the course of her enhanced pre-trial disclosure, 
  Ms. Glover revealed that from 1989 to 1994, she had been physically, sexually 
  and psychologically abused by the appellant on a regular basis and the system 
  had generally failed to provide her with adequate protection. If need be, she 
  was willing to testify to ten or eleven specific incidents which, in combination, 
  painted a rather bleak picture of the appellant, portraying him as a man given 
  to violence, possessiveness and jealousy and a need to dominate and control. 
  As well, it was made known to the defence that nine independent witnesses were 
  available to give evidence that confirmed Ms. Glover's evidence of abuse.</p>
<p>
  [35] The defence was also told that Dr. Peter Jaffe, a clinical psychologist, 
  had conducted a psychological assessment of Ms. Glover. If asked, Dr. Jaffe 
  was prepared to state that Ms. Glover suffered from two psychiatric conditions 
  known as Battered Women's Syndrome and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and that 
  in his opinion, these conditions were capable of explaining the incremental 
  nature of her disclosure. </p>
<p>
  [36] In sum, the defence was put on notice, well in advance of Ms. Glover testifying, 
  that the Crown had in its possession a substantial body of evidence that could 
  reasonably explain the apparent inconsistencies in her evidence if the defence 
  chose to raise them. By the same token, the Crown made it known that it would 
  not seek to lead any of that evidence if the defence agreed not to expose the 
  inconsistencies.</p>
<p>
  [37] The defence refused the Crown's offer and chose to expose the inconsistencies. 
  Accordingly, Crown counsel brought a pre-trial motion in which he sought permission 
  to bring out as part of his case in-chief the inconsistencies arising from Ms. 
  Glover's incremental disclosure and the evidence he planned to lead to explain 
  them. That, of course, was the proper procedure to follow. The proposed explanatory 
  evidence involved evidence of the appellant's bad character and as such, it 
  would normally not be admissible. As well, the opinion evidence was of a type 
  that required judicial screening.</p>
<p>
  The Trial Judge's Ruling</p>
<p>
  [38] In accordance with this court's decision in R. v. Speid (1985), 20 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 534 at pp. 546-7, the trial judge ruled that Ms. Glover would be permitted 
  to explain her prior inconsistent statements even though her explanation would 
  result in the disclosure of crimes and other forms of disreputable conduct committed 
  by the appellant. Although the trial judge made no mention in his ruling of 
  the nine independent witnesses whom the Crown proposed to call in support of 
  Ms. Glover's testimony, that is because the defence did not challenge the admissibility 
  of their evidence. The trial judge did, however, address the admissibility of 
  Dr. Jaffe's evidence. As the record reveals, it was his evidence that the defence 
  was primarily contesting. </p>
<p>
  [39] In ruling against the defence, the trial judge found that in her enhanced 
  disclosure to the police, Ms. Glover linked the inconsistencies in her earlier 
  statements to the appellant's abusive conduct and thus satisfied the connection 
  needed to permit Dr. Jaffe to testify. He further found that Dr. Jaffe's expert 
  opinion would &quot;be helpful to the jury to understand the dynamics of couples 
  and spousal abuse&quot; and that Dr. Jaffe had &quot;the necessary expertise 
  to meet the required threshold of reliability&quot;. In accordance with Speid, 
  supra, he was satisfied that the Crown could call Dr. Jaffe to support Ms. Glover's 
  explanation of her prior inconsistent statements to the extent that her explanation 
  hinged on the appellant's prior abusive treatment of her. Finally, in ruling 
  Dr. Jaffe's evidence admissible, the trial judge held that his testimony was 
  &quot;relevant and probative to the issue of the credibility of Joan Glover, 
  upon which ultimately the jury will make a finding&quot; and that its probative 
  value would not be overshadowed by its prejudicial effect.</p>
<p>
  EVIDENTIARY ISSUES</p>
<p>(a) The Explanatory Evidence</p>
<p>
  [40] On appeal, counsel for the appellant did not challenge the admissibility 
  of Dr. Jaffe's evidence in total. On the contrary, with his usual candour, Mr. 
  Litkowski conceded in oral argument that a brief description of the nature and 
  root causes of the psychiatric conditions known as the Battered Women's Syndrome 
  and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and their possible effects on disclosure 
  patterns would have been acceptable. The chief complaint now is that Dr. Jaffe's 
  evidence exceeded the limited purpose for which it was receivable and that it 
  contravened the rule against oath-helping.</p>
<p>
  [41] Aside from the impermissible aspects of Dr. Jaffe's evidence, Mr. Litkowski 
  raised an overriding concern about the sheer volume of evidence that was led 
  to explain Ms. Glover's prior inconsistent statements. In this regard, he drew 
  our attention to the hundreds of pages of transcript devoted to Ms. Glover's 
  evidence of prior abuse and the related evidence of Dr. Jaffe and the nine confirmatory 
  witnesses called by the Crown and he submitted that the prejudicial effect of 
  that body of evidence far outweighed its probative value. </p>
<p>
  [42] According to Mr. Litkowski, the prejudice occasioned by that evidence took 
  three forms. First, it portrayed the appellant as an evil man. Second, it placed 
  the appellant in the position of having to defend himself not only against the 
  murder charge but against a series of abuse allegations as well. (The appellant 
  denied many of the allegations of abuse and sought to portray others in a different 
  light than Ms. Glover). Third, given the large number of abusive incidents and 
  the conflicting evidence in relation to them, there was a real risk that the 
  jury's attention would be deflected away from the murder charge and drawn instead 
  to the abuse allegations.</p>
<p>
  [43] Balancing these concerns against the probative value of the evidence, which 
  according to Mr. Litkowski went solely to Ms. Glover's credibility, Mr. Litkowski 
  maintained that the cost of receiving the evidence far outweighed its limited 
  value. In the end, I understood Mr. Litkowski to say that in the interest of 
  trial fairness, it was essential that the explanatory evidence be pared down 
  and limited to its bare essentials. To achieve this, the trial judge should 
  have excluded the evidence of the nine confirmatory witnesses and much of Dr. 
  Jaffe's evidence.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [44] I propose to begin my analysis with Dr. Jaffe's evidence. I shall then 
  turn to the appellant's overriding concern about the sheer volume of explanatory 
  evidence and the prejudice occasioned by it. </p>
<p>
  [45] With respect to Dr. Jaffe, I am of the view that his evidence suffered 
  from many flaws, the most egregious being that it exceeded its proper purpose 
  and crossed the line into impermissible oath-helping.</p>
<p>
  [46] In my view, Dr. Jaffe's evidence was admissible but only for a limited 
  purpose. It should have been restricted to a brief description of the nature 
  and root causes of the conditions known as Battered Women's Syndrome and Post-traumatic 
  Stress Disorder and their possible effects on disclosure patterns. Had the evidence 
  been so limited, it could have been given in brief compass. That is what should 
  have occurred (see R. v. K.(A.) (1999), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at 278 (Ont.C.A.) 
  and R. v. F.(D.S.) (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 109 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [47] As it is, Dr. Jaffe's evidence consumed the better part of 100 pages of 
  transcript. With respect, much of it was taken up with long, drawn-out examples 
  that bore little relationship to the case at hand and rambling unstructured 
  answers that took the form of a lecture. The fault in this regard does not rest 
  entirely with Dr. Jaffe. Defence counsel failed to object and Crown counsel 
  failed to rein Dr. Jaffe in.</p>
<p>
  [48] Apart from these general concerns, it was highly improper for Crown counsel 
  to put a 16 page hypothetical question to Dr. Jaffe that tracked in detail the 
  various incidents of abuse described by Ms. Glover and ended with the question 
  &quot;does that scenario say anything to you?&quot; Not unexpectedly, that question 
  evoked a rambling response that went on for the better part of 12 pages. In 
  it, Dr. Jaffe confirmed that the scenario described had all of the hallmarks 
  of Battered Women's Syndrome and that if he had assessed the hypothetical victim, 
  he would have diagnosed her as &quot;somebody who was suffering from battered 
  wife syndrome&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [49] As if that was not enough, the Crown then proceeded to go through the hypothetical 
  scenario again, this time focusing on particular aspects of the victim's conduct 
  and asking whether they were consistent or inconsistent with someone in an abusive 
  relationship. Not surprisingly, Dr. Jaffe found the various responses of the 
  hypothetical victim to be entirely consistent with a woman caught up in an abusive 
  relationship.</p>
<p>
  [50] The Crown then followed the same tack with respect to the second psychiatric 
  variant known as Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. He did so by presenting Dr. 
  Jaffe with a hypothetical scenario that tracked the events witnessed by Ms. 
  Glover on the night of the homicide and then asking whether the nature of that 
  event, in combination with the violence experienced by the first hypothetical 
  victim, could give rise to Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. Not unexpectedly, 
  Dr. Jaffe answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>
  [51] Crown counsel then proceeded to describe, again in the form of a lengthy 
  hypothetical question, the initial disclosure given by Ms. Glover and the enhanced 
  version that formed the basis of her trial testimony. Crown counsel continued 
  by asking Dr. Jaffe whether the pattern of disclosure described was consistent 
  or inconsistent with what he would expect from the hypothetical victim under 
  consideration. As expected, Dr. Jaffe found it to be entirely consistent with 
  someone suffering from Battered Women's Syndrome and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. 
  In other words, in Dr. Jaffe's opinion, the psychiatric conditions could be 
  looked to as a complete explanation for Ms. Glover's prior inconsistent statements.</p>
<p>
  [52] In my view, the hypothetical questions and answers went far beyond the 
  legitimate purpose for which Dr. Jaffe's expert testimony was receivable. The 
  jury was presented with a neatly wrapped package that effectively masked the 
  weaknesses in Ms. Glover's testimony and cloaked it with an aura of scientific 
  reliability. Contrary to the submission of the respondent, I do not accept that 
  Dr. Jaffe's evidence merely had the effect of bolstering Ms. Glover's credibility. 
  In my view, it was calculated to achieve that end and as such, it was improper. 
  (See R. v. K.(A.), supra at pp. 277-8 and R. v. Marquard (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 
  193 at 229 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [53] Remarkably, the improper scope of Dr. Jaffe's testimony did not stop there. 
  Before completing his examination-in-chief, Crown counsel elicited from Dr. 
  Jaffe the fact that he had assessed Ms. Glover prior to trial and that based 
  on his assessment, he was satisfied that she was suffering from Battered Women's 
  Syndrome at the time of the homicide and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder thereafter. 
  </p>
<p>
  [54] In the circumstances, that evidence was highly improper. Unquestionably, 
  Dr. Jaffe's opinion was based in part on Ms. Glover's description of the appellant's 
  abusive conduct towards her. In concluding that she was suffering from Battered 
  Women's Syndrome and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, he was effectively telling 
  the jury that in his professional opinion, Ms. Glover was telling the truth 
  about the various incidents of abuse attributed to the appellant. Had that aspect 
  of her evidence been uncontested, the harm would have been minimal. As it is, 
  the appellant denied many of the incidents and portrayed others in a different 
  light than Ms. Glover. The resulting credibility dispute was for the jury to 
  resolve. Dr. Jaffe's testimony effectively usurped that function.</p>
<p>
  [55] For these reasons, I agree with the appellant that much of Dr. Jaffe's 
  evidence was inadmissible and it should not have been presented to the jury. 
  That however is where I draw the line. I do not share the appellant's further 
  concern that the trial judge should have excluded the evidence of the nine confirmatory 
  witnesses. Specifically, for reasons that follow, I reject the appellant's overriding 
  submission that the prejudicial effect of the explanatory evidence overshadowed 
  its probative value. </p>
<p>
  [56] First, as I have already pointed out, defence counsel did not object to 
  the testimony of the confirmatory witnesses. Accordingly, the trial judge can 
  hardly be faulted for admitting their evidence.</p>
<p>
  [57] Second, I am of the view that the evidence relating to Ms. Glover's prior 
  abuse has far greater probative value than the appellant is prepared to admit. 
  The appellant has attempted to marginalize its value by suggesting that it goes 
  solely to the issue of Ms. Glover's credibility. If that were so, I might have 
  been more receptive to his overriding submission that by its sheer volume, the 
  explanatory evidence created a level of prejudice that was unacceptable. That 
  however, is not the case. In addition to being probative of Ms. Glover's credibility, 
  the evidence of prior abuse went directly to the issue of motive and provided 
  the Crown with the missing link needed to complete its formidable circumstantial 
  case against the appellant. </p>
<p>
  [58] To be precise, the evidence of prior abuse was admissible to shed light 
  on the nature of the appellant's relationship with Ms. Glover. It disclosed 
  his need to dominate and showed him to be a man given to violence, possessiveness 
  and jealousy. Based on this, Crown counsel was entitled to go to the jury, as 
  he did, and invite them to find that the appellant killed Parker not in self-defence 
  but in a fit of jealous rage. Viewed that way, I am satisfied that the probative 
  value of Ms. Glover's evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect and justified 
  the admission of the evidence given by the nine confirmatory witnesses.</p>
<p>
  [59] Third, although by no means decisive, I am satisfied that defence counsel's 
  decision to cross-examine Ms. Glover on her prior inconsistent statements was 
  a tactical one made with full knowledge of the potential consequences. In short, 
  as the record reveals, the defence wanted the best of both worlds. By exposing 
  Ms. Glover's prior inconsistent statements, defence counsel hoped to cast doubt 
  on her credibility. As for the evidence of prior abuse, it provided Ms. Glover 
  with a motive to fabricate evidence against the appellant because of the suffering 
  he had caused her for so many years. Not unexpectedly, that is precisely the 
  approach taken by defence counsel in his closing address to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [60] In the end, I would give effect to this ground of appeal but only in so 
  far as it relates to the scope and extent of Dr. Jaffe's testimony.</p>
<p>Reply Evidence</p>
<p>
  [61] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown 
  to lead reply evidence from Police Constable Kennedy. Constable Kennedy testified 
  about a statement made to him by the appellant shortly after his arrest in which 
  the appellant stated that Parker had attacked him while he was lying in bed.</p>
<p>
  [62] According to the Crown, Constable Kennedy's evidence took on significance 
  only after the appellant had testified and stated that Parker first attacked 
  him in the hallway after he had come out of his bedroom. In cross-examination, 
  it was put to the appellant that he had told Constable Kennedy that the initial 
  attack had occurred in his bedroom. The appellant denied making any such statement. 
  </p>
<p>
  [63] In my view, the trial judge did not err in permitting the reply evidence. 
  This is not a case in which the appellant was caught off guard or unfairly trapped 
  by the Crown. Constable Kennedy's 'will-say' statement had been disclosed to 
  the appellant and the appellant therefore knew what his evidence would be. The 
  Crown was not required to lead the appellant's statement to Constable Kennedy 
  in-chief. At that stage, it amounted to little more than a self-serving uncorroborated 
  statement of marginal relevance. As the respondent points out, &quot;calling 
  [Constable Kennedy's] evidence in-chief would not have materially advanced the 
  inquiry into how Mr. Parker died&quot;. Once the appellant testified however, 
  Constable Kennedy's evidence took on real significance and in my view, it was 
  properly admissible in reply. </p>
<p>
  [64] In ruling the reply evidence admissible, the trial judge found that because 
  the appellant had admitted the voluntariness of his statements to the police, 
  that admission carried with it a presumption that he had made the various statements 
  attributed to him. In view of that, the trial judge viewed the appellant's denial 
  of having made the statement as a retreat from his earlier concession, something 
  the Crown could not foresee. Accordingly, the trial judge considered the proposed 
  reply evidence to be proper.</p>
<p>
  [65] The trial judge erred in his analysis. An admission of voluntariness in 
  respect of a statement does not translate into an admission that the statement 
  was actually made (R. v. Gauthier (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 14 at 20 (S.C.C.)). 
  In the circumstances, however, the error was harmless. While the trial judge's 
  analysis of the issue may have been wrong, he reached the right conclusion. 
  Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES RELATING TO THE CHARGE</p>
<p>
  [66] The appellant raised a number of issues relating to the trial judge's charge 
  to the jury. Most can be dealt with in brief compass. The only one of concern 
  relates to the manner in which the jury was instructed on the principles enunciated 
  in R. v. W.(D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.). In particular, the question 
  that arises is how those instructions should be framed when the primary defence 
  is self-defence. </p>
<p>
  The Elements of Self-defence</p>
<p>
  [67] Commencing with the more straightforward issues, the appellant submitted 
  that in instructing the jury on self-defence under s. 34(2) of the Criminal 
  Code, the trial judge misled the jury into thinking that the defence would not 
  apply if the appellant knew that the injuries he was inflicting to Parker were 
  likely to kill him. The impugned passage from the charge reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The accused man testified in his cross-examination &#133; that at the time he 
  hit Parker with the hammer he knew there was a potential to cause Parker serious 
  injury or death. &#133; The accused admits that throughout the whole process 
  of stabbing Parker he had knowledge that he could be killing Parker. Ladies 
  and gentlemen, these admissions go directly to the elements of murder and the 
  issue of self-defence.</p>
<p>
  [68] I would not give effect to this ground. While the instructions on self-defence 
  were not a model of perfection, I am not persuaded that the jury was misled 
  as the appellant suggests. I do not read the impugned passage as speaking to 
  the elements of self-defence. Rather, as the respondent points out, when read 
  in context, it is simply a reference to the appellant's credibility and its 
  importance to the jury in assessing his claim to self-defence.</p>
<p>
  Reasonable Doubt</p>
<p>
  [69] The appellant takes issue with the trial judge's instruction on reasonable 
  doubt. Specifically, he submits that the trial judge erred by telling the jury 
  that the words 'reasonable doubt' should be given their ordinary meaning and 
  by failing to locate the criminal standard of proof. Bearing in mind this court's 
  recent jurisprudence on the subject (see for example R. v. Rochon and McAuley, 
  [2003] O.J. No. 1155), I am satisfied when the charge is read as a whole, that 
  the jury would have understood the correct standard of proof. Accordingly, I 
  would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  The W.(D.) Instruction</p>
<p>
  [70] The trial judge's instruction on the application of the W.(D.) principles 
  is more troublesome. The impugned passage from the charge reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  First, if you accept the evidence favouring the accused, including his testimony 
  on this matter, and find it to be factually true when weighed against the contradictory 
  evidence, you may acquit the accused. Second, even if you do not find as a fact 
  that the evidence favouring the accused in this matter is true, but have a reasonable 
  doubt as a result of it, you may also acquit the accused. Third, even if you 
  do not have a reasonable doubt on this matter as a result of the evidence favouring 
  the accused because you reject that evidence as untrue, you must still determine 
  whether the Crown has convinced you of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable 
  doubt on the basis of the evidence which you do accept and find to be factually 
  true.</p>
<p>
  [71] Although the appellant took issue with several aspects of that instruction, 
  in my view, the only area of concern is the portion in which the trial judge 
  directed the jury that they may acquit if they believe the appellant's evidence 
  or if it leaves them in a state of reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>
  [72] At one level, that instruction is understandable because the defence of 
  self-defence contains objective components. Accordingly, the defence can fail 
  even if the jury accepts the accused's evidence. The problem with the instruction 
  is that it fails to bring home to the jury the circumstances under which they 
  must acquit. While I am satisfied that in other portions of the charge, the 
  trial judge made it clear to the jury that they must acquit if they believed 
  or had a reasonable doubt that the appellant was acting in lawful self-defence 
  when he killed Parker, I believe that it would have been preferable had that 
  message been brought home in the context of the W.(D.) instructions. Such an 
  approach would avoid the possibility of the jury being misled into thinking 
  that they retained an overriding discretion to convict even though they otherwise 
  believed or had a reasonable doubt that the appellant was acting in lawful self-defence 
  at the time of the killing. To guard against that possibility, I would suggest 
  that in future cases, when the defence of self-defence is raised and the trial 
  judge believes that a W.(D.) instruction is warranted, the jury should be instructed 
  along these lines with respect to the first two principles: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. If you accept the accused's evidence and on the basis of 
  it, you believe or have a reasonable doubt that he/she was acting in lawful 
  self-defence as I have defined that term to you, you will find the accused not 
  guilty.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Even if you do not accept the accused's evidence, if, after 
  considering it alone or in conjunction with the other evidence, you believe 
  or have a reasonable doubt that he/she was acting in lawful self-defence as 
  I have defined that term to you, you will find the accused not guilty.</p>
<p>
  [73] As indicated, the W.(D.) instruction given by the trial judge was potentially 
  confusing. However, when it is considered in the context of the charge as a 
  whole, I am satisfied that the jury would not have been misled into thinking 
  that they could convict even though they otherwise believed or had a reasonable 
  doubt that the appellant was acting in lawful self-defence at the time of the 
  killing. Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  Instructions Relating to Dr. Jaffe's Evidence</p>
<p>
  [74] The final two grounds relating to the charge involve Dr. Jaffe's evidence. 
  First, the appellant submits that the trial judge misled the jury as to the 
  content of Dr. Jaffe's evidence on the subject of validity testing that he performed. 
  I do not agree with that submission. In my view, the trial judge accurately 
  recited the evidence and defence counsel at trial did not contend otherwise. 
  </p>
<p>
  [75] Second, the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to adequately 
  instruct the jury on the permissible and impermissible uses of Dr. Jaffe's testimony. 
  Again, I disagree. The trial judge told the jury that they could use Dr. Jaffe's 
  evidence in deciding whether there was an explanation for the inconsistencies 
  in Ms. Glover's testimony. At the same time, the trial judge made it clear that 
  it was for the jury to decide whether or not they accepted the explanations 
  offered by Dr. Jaffe, that they were not required to accept his opinion merely 
  because he was an expert and that it was for them alone to decide whether Dr. 
  Jaffe's opinions were or were not sound. Finally, the trial judge told the jury, 
  in forceful terms, that it was for them to decide whether Ms. Glover's allegations 
  of abuse were true and if so, &quot;whether the result of this abuse caused 
  [her] to make her incremental disclosure as she did, as outlined by Dr. Jaffe.&quot; 
  The jury was given a similar instruction regarding Ms. Glover's evidence &quot;as 
  to what she saw&quot; on the night in question. </p>
<p>
  [76] Once again, defence counsel at trial raised no objection to this aspect 
  of the trial judge's instructions. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that 
  the instructions were adequate. </p>
<p>
  FRESH EVIDENCE</p>
<p> [77] The appellant sought to introduce fresh evidence with a view to establishing: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>that Ms. Glover may have been suffering from Bipolar Disorder in and around 
    the time of the homicide;</li>
  <li>that such a disorder may have affected her ability to process information 
    and accurately recollect events;</li>
  <li>that Dr. Jaffe may have missed the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder in concluding 
    that Ms. Glover suffered from Post-traumatic Stress disorder; and</li>
  <li>if Ms. Glover was suffering from Bipolar Disorder, the reliability of Dr. 
    Jaffe's opinion would be called into question.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I would not receive the proposed fresh evidence for several reasons.</p>
<p>
  [78] First, it could have been adduced at trial through due diligence. Second, 
  taken at its highest, it does nothing more than raise the possibility that in 
  the year 2000, five years after the homicide, Ms. Glover may have been suffering 
  from Bipolar Disorder. Beyond that, there is no evidence capable of establishing 
  that Ms. Glover was suffering from Bipolar Disorder at the time of the homicide 
  in 1995 or at the time of trial in 1997. Accordingly, the proposed evidence 
  lacks the probative value required to meet the fourth test in Palmer and Palmer 
  v. The Queen (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193 at 205 (S.C.C.). (See also R. v. Smith 
  (2001), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at pp. 24-5 (Ont.C.A.)). In sum, I am not at all persuaded 
  that the proposed evidence, if believed, could reasonably be expected to have 
  affected the verdict. Accordingly, I would not receive it.</p>
<p>
  THE CURATIVE PROVISO</p>
<p> [79] On this record, the admission of Dr. Jaffe's oath-helping evidence was 
  the only error of potential consequence. Assuming the worst, the jury would 
  have used it to explain the inconsistencies in Ms. Glover's testimony and adopted 
  her trial testimony as truthful. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  [80] Manifestly, Ms. Glover's testimony did not advance the appellant's case 
  of self-defence. By the same token, given the brief time frame within which 
  she made her observations (between 5 to 10 seconds) and bearing in mind the 
  appellant's testimony that the hammer may have glanced off Parker's head in 
  their initial struggle, and that once he got control of it, he struck Parker 
  over the head with it, there was certainly room for the jury to reconcile Ms. 
  Glover's momentary observations with the appellant's testimony. In that event, 
  the harm caused by Dr. Jaffe's impermissible evidence would have been negligible 
  and it would have had no impact on the jury's verdict.</p>
<p>
  [81] Assuming the worst however, the question that must be answered is whether 
  the verdict would necessarily have been the same had Ms. Glover's direct evidence 
  of the fight been rejected. I have framed the matter that way because disbelief 
  of her trial testimony would have left the Crown without direct evidence helpful 
  to its case; it would not have created evidence favourable to the appellant. 
  Viewed that way, I am satisfied that the remainder of the evidence was so overwhelming 
  that the verdict would necessarily have been the same even if the jury had disbelieved 
  Ms. Glover's brief direct testimony.</p>
<p>
  [82] Earlier in these reasons, I outlined the evidence for and against the defence 
  of self-defence. I see no reason to review it. Suffice it to say that in my 
  opinion, the circumstantial case against the appellant, based as it was on a 
  powerful body of forensic evidence, betrayed the appellant's version of the 
  events and painted the picture of a one-sided onslaught. That picture would 
  not change at a new trial. The only possible change would be the scope of Dr. 
  Jaffe's evidence and the impact that might have, if any, on the jury's assessment 
  of Ms. Glover's credibility.</p>
<p>
  [83] In these circumstances, like Arbour J. in R. v. Arradi (2003), 173 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), I would adopt the following statement made by Binnie J. in 
  R. v. Jolivet, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 751 at para. 46: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Ordering a new trial raises significant issues for the administration of justice 
  and the proper allocation of resources. Where the evidence against an accused 
  is powerful and there is no realistic possibility that a new trial would produce 
  a different verdict, it is manifestly in the public interest to avoid the cost 
  and delay of further proceedings. Parliament has so provided.</p>
<p>
  [84] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction.</p>
<p>
  SENTENCE APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [85] The trial judge gave brief but succinct reasons for increasing the appellant's 
  period of parole ineligibility from ten to fifteen years. In arriving at that 
  figure, he was not guided by the jury. As representatives of the community, 
  they chose to make no recommendation. </p>
<p>
  [86] In his reasons, the trial judge quite properly emphasized the gravity and 
  seriousness of the appellant's crime. This was a brutal and senseless homicide 
  born out of misplaced jealousy and rage. The appellant's prior abusive conduct 
  towards Ms. Glover was also a serious aggravating feature. In the end, the trial 
  judge was fully justified in increasing the appellant's period of parole ineligibility. 
  </p>
<p>
  [87] That said, I am of the view that in raising the period from ten to fifteen 
  years, the trial judge failed to give adequate consideration to the appellant's 
  personal circumstances and characteristics and his prospects for rehabilitation. 
  Apart from the prior abusive conduct towards Ms. Glover, the appellant had no 
  prior convictions for violence. In respect of the crime itself, to his credit, 
  after inflicting the terrible injuries to Parker, the appellant did not flee 
  the scene but instead, he called the police. As well, despite the trial judge's 
  observations that he was without remorse, the appellant did express regret for 
  what had occurred.</p>
<p>
  [88] Other evidence available at the sentence hearing indicated that the appellant 
  was still a relatively young man (in his early 30's at the time of the homicide) 
  and that he had been gainfully employed for most of his adult life. A number 
  of character letters attested to his prior good character and his family remained 
  very supportive.</p>
<p>
  [89] Unfortunately, these redeeming features seem to have been ignored by the 
  trial judge. Indeed, in his reasons, the trial judge stated that &quot;there 
  are no redeeming features that I can discern in your character&quot;. That remark 
  confirms my opinion that the trial judge failed to give adequate consideration 
  to the appellant's rehabilitative prospects in imposing the sentence he did.</p>
<p>
  [90] In all of the circumstances, I am of the view that this case called for 
  an increase in the period of parole ineligibility from ten to twelve years. 
  Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal the sentence and reduce the period 
  of parole ineligibility to twelve years.</p>
