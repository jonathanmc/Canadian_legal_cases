<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was acquitted on three charges of sexual assault and one 
  charge of trafficking in a narcotic. He was convicted on one count of trafficking 
  in a narcotic. The conviction rested entirely on the evidence of T.M. who testified 
  that the appellant, a cab driver, purchased a small amount of marijuana for 
  her from another cab driver outside of a store called &quot;Mike's Mart&quot; 
  in Timmins, Ontario. </p>
<p>
  [2] T.M. was also the complainant on two of the sexual assault charges and gave 
  evidence against the appellant on the third sexual assault charge. She was the 
  only witness on the other trafficking charge as well. The trial judge rejected 
  her evidence on all other counts. In doing so, he accepted the appellant's position 
  that she had fabricated the sexual assault charges in an effort to avoid paying 
  a debt that she owed to the appellant. Indeed, she had gone so far as to enlist 
  the aid of a friend in her efforts to frame the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [3] In choosing to accept T.M.'s evidence on the one trafficking charge, the 
  trial judge referred to that evidence as &quot;unchallenged&quot; and noted 
  that the evidence was &quot;detailed&quot;. He made no reference to any specific 
  detail in her evidence that in his view gave this part of her testimony the 
  ring of truth despite his rejection of the rest of her evidence. </p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge made no reference to the appellant's evidence on this count. 
  The appellant denied trafficking in a narcotic on that occasion or any other 
  occasion. He was not cross-examined on this denial. </p>
<p>
  [5] We are satisfied that the conviction cannot stand. A trier of fact may, 
  of course, believe part of a witness's evidence even if other parts of that 
  witness's evidence are found to be unreliable and incredible. However, where 
  that witness is found to have deliberately fabricated a criminal allegation 
  against an accused, we think the trier of fact must have a clear and logical 
  basis for choosing to accept one part of that witness's testimony having rejected 
  the rest of it. We can find no clear or logical basis for drawing a distinction 
  between this witness's credibility on the trafficking charge and the credibility 
  of the rest of her evidence. </p>
<p>
  [6] The trial judge was wrong in describing T.M.'s evidence as unchallenged. 
  She was cross-examined on this allegation. Her evidence was also no more detailed 
  on this allegation than it was on all of the other allegations which she made 
  in the course of her evidence against the appellant. Finally, the trial judge, 
  in our view, should have considered the appellant's evidence on this count. 
  </p>
<p>
  [7] In the result, we are satisfied that the conviction was unreasonable in 
  that no reasonable trier of fact, having found T.M. to be incredible on all 
  of the other charges, could have been satisfied of the appellant's guilt on 
  the trafficking charge based exclusively on T.M.'s evidence.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appeal is allowed, the conviction is set aside and an acquittal is entered.</p>
