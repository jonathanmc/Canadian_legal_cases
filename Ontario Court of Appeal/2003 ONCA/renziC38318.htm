<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The Crown appeals from the sentence imposed by the trial judge of nine 
  years including 30 months of pre-trial custody which he counted as five years. 
  The trial judge effectively imposed a five-year sentence on the respondent for 
  conspiracy to kidnap his wife and counselling the murder of his wife, and four 
  years consecutive for one count of counselling the murder of a Crown attorney 
  and of his wife. </p>
<p>
  [2] The Crown submits that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly 
  unfit. We agree with that submission. </p>
<p>
  [3] Although the trial judge referred to the serious nature of the crimes and 
  the need for general deterrence and denunciation in imposing sentence, he failed 
  to give sufficient weight to these factors in the egregious circumstances of 
  this case, nor did he sufficiently address the numerous aggravating factors 
  in these offences. </p>
<p>
  [4] Foremost among the aggravating factors is the identity of the victims and 
  the requirement that the court recognize the special protection that must be 
  accorded to a spouse as well as to all persons who are involved in the administration 
  of justice. The threat to harm a spouse and a Crown attorney and his wife require 
  that the court emphasize denunciation and general deterrence in imposing sentence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] The other aggravating factors here are the deliberate, calculating and callous 
  conduct of the respondent which continued over an extended period of time; the 
  fact that the counselling to kidnap and murder his wife a second time and to 
  extend the crime to the Crown Attorney and his wife was carried out while the 
  appellant was in custody after being arrested for his first attempt to have 
  his wife kidnapped; the fact that there were three intended victims; and the 
  fact that the plan included gratuitous violence. </p>
<p>
  [6] The result of the foregoing is that this court is at liberty to review the 
  sentence and to impose a sentence that we consider fit and appropriate. The 
  Crown at trial and on appeal seeks a total sentence of fourteen years including 
  five years of pre-trial custody. The Crown does not object to the trial judge's 
  apportionment of five years for the offences involving the respondent's wife. 
  He says that the four years for the offence against the Crown Attorney and his 
  wife should be increased to nine years. In our view, the four-year sentence 
  for the offence against the Crown attorney and his wife should be increased 
  from four years to eight years. The total sentence is therefore thirteen years, 
  giving credit for five years of pre-trial custody. </p>
<p>
  [7] In the result, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed, 
  the sentence in respect of the third count is increased to eight years, and 
  the total sentence is increased from nine years to thirteen years.</p>
