<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant brought a motion seeking an extension of the time to seek 
  a review of an order of Doherty J.A. made on December 12, 2002, and if the extension 
  is granted, asking that the order be set aside or varied. The order required 
  him to post $250,000 in security in a form agreeable to the parties by February 
  12, 2003.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant's solicitor explained that an appeal of Doherty J.A.'s decision 
  of December 12, 2002 was not filed within four days because Doherty J.A., in 
  oral reasons, indicated that the appellant would be permitted a reasonable period 
  to arrange to post the security ordered and that he (Doherty J.A.) would remain 
  seized of the matter going forward. </p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant attempted to comply with the order by offering to place a 
  mortgage on his interest, if any, in the Woodlawn Road property and Vardon Drive 
  property. The respondents found the offered security unacceptable. The parties 
  attended upon Doherty J.A. on February 6, 2003 by way of telephone conference 
  call at which time Doherty J.A. made a further order that the proposed security 
  did not constitute security for costs and that he would not direct that the 
  proffered mortgages were suitable security. Four days later, on February 10, 
  2003, the appellant served a Notice of Appeal, seeking a review of the December 
  12, 2002 and February 6, 2003 orders.</p>
<p>
  [4] In the circumstances, we are not satisfied that an extension of time is 
  necessary. If it is, however, we grant it. The appellant's solicitor has explained 
  that he understood that the period for review would not expire before the period 
  granted for compliance with the order of December 12, 2002, in light of the 
  fact that Doherty J.A. had said he would remain seized of the matter. We accept 
  his explanation.</p>
<p>
  [5] On this appeal the appellant does not challenge the finding of Doherty J.A. 
  that the appellant corporation is not impecunious in the extended sense that 
  the shareholders and principals of the corporation are unable to fund security 
  for costs. What the appellant appeals is the finding that the appellant or others 
  on its behalf, would be able to post security in the amount of $250,000 in a 
  form acceptable to the respondents, which they have said must be by cash or 
  letter of credit. </p>
<p>
  [6] In our view, Doherty J.A. was entitled to decide, based on the record, that 
  $250,000 was an appropriate figure for security for costs and that given the 
  lack of clarity of the appellant's financial capability, to conclude that it 
  was reasonable to require security to be posted in that amount by the appellant 
  or on its behalf. </p>
<p>
  [7] No further evidence was presented on this appeal suggesting that the appellant 
  could post security but only in a lesser amount.</p>
<p>
  [8] In the circumstances, we are prepared to allow the appellant a further period 
  of time to post the security in the full amount of $250,000 in a form satisfactory 
  to the respondents, acting reasonably. The security is to be posted on or before 
  June 30, 2003. </p>
<p>
  [9] As the respondents were unsuccessful in opposing the extension of time to 
  appeal issue, costs to the respondents on the merits, fixed at $1,500 to Airstruc 
  and Dalziel, $1,000 to Tacoma and $1,000 to Yeadon. </p>
