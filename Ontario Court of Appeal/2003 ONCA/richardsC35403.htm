<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>[1] The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent by Justice Dempsey 
  of the Ontario Court of Justice on November 10, 2000 on two counts of dangerous 
  driving causing death.</p>
<p>
  1. Background</p>
<p>
  [2] The charges against the respondent arose from a horrific motor vehicle accident 
  beside a four lane regional highway situated east of Ottawa, Ontario, which 
  resulted in two fatalities. On the night in question, the respondent was driving 
  a motor vehicle westbound on the highway. He was accompanied by two passengers. 
  He lost control of the vehicle while on the highway, causing it to leave the 
  road and cross onto a grass median which divided the eastbound and westbound 
  lanes of the highway. Thereafter, his vehicle struck a concrete pillar. The 
  car exploded violently on impact with the pillar, resulting in a series of explosions 
  and a fire which engulfed the car. The respondent's passengers died instantaneously 
  on impact.</p>
<p>
  [3] An investigating police officer testified, based on his calculations after 
  the accident, that the respondent's vehicle was travelling at a minimum speed 
  of 119 kilometres per hour in a 100 kilometre per hour zone when it left the 
  highway. The trial judge, in accepting that evidence, observed that it did not 
  take into account the fact of the collision with the pillar, that is, the estimate 
  assumed that the vehicle would have come to a full stop in its forward momentum 
  just before the collision with the pillar. However, had the collision with the 
  pillar been taken into account, the estimate of the vehicle's minimum speed 
  would have been increased substantially. The same police evidence suggested 
  that the speed range of the respondent's vehicle on dry grass would have been 
  between 103 to 133 kilometres per hour, and between 83 to 119 kilometres per 
  hour on wet grass. Various eye witnesses to the accident described the speed 
  of the respondent's vehicle at the time of impact as between 80 to 120 kilometres 
  per hour.</p>
<p>
  [4] After the accident, approximately 140 to 150 metres of tire marks from the 
  respondent's vehicle were observed, beginning on the highway and continuing 
  to the point of impact with the pillar, thus indicating that the respondent 
  applied his brakes while he was still on the roadway. However, there was no 
  evidence of steering of the vehicle by the respondent before the steering wheel 
  locked on application of the brakes.</p>
<p>
  [5] The Crown submits that, other than his excessive rate of speed, no cause 
  explaining the respondent's loss of control of his vehicle was open on the evidence 
  at trial.</p>
<p>
  [6] The respondent did not testify at trial. However, he introduced videotape 
  evidence of the roadway through a defence private investigator in support of 
  the suggestion that he may have lost control of his vehicle when he missed, 
  or failed to successfully navigate, a 12 foot jog to the right in the highway, 
  situated a distance of approximately two-tenths of a kilometre before the interchange 
  where the accident occurred. The trial judge rejected that theory of causation 
  on the basis that it was unsupported by the evidence. He also held that there 
  was no evidence to support a conclusion that: (i) the respondent's vehicle had 
  collided with another vehicle; (ii) a tire had blown on the respondent's vehicle; 
  (iii) a mechanical defect existed in or on the vehicle; or (iv) the incident 
  was alcohol-related.</p>
<p>
  2. Discussion</p>
<p>
  [7] The Crown raises several issues in support of its appeal. In our view, we 
  need address only one ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [8] The trial judge correctly observed that, to enter a conviction, it was necessary 
  that he be satisfied that the respondent's driving amounted to a marked departure 
  from the standard of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the 
  respondent's situation. Further, he noted that the mens rea for the offence 
  of dangerous driving must be assessed objectively, in the context of all the 
  circumstances surrounding the incident: R. v. Hundal (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 
  97 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [9] However, the trial judge subsequently stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> In summary, however, I find that when the evidence in this 
  matter is reduced to its essentials the only evidence remaining is evidence 
  of excessive speed. The Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Pezzo (1972), 9 C.C.C. 
  (2d) 530, confirmed that in and of itself evidence of speed alone is insufficient 
  to ground a conviction under Section 249 of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p class="indent">I am therefore left with only evidence of speed, which given 
  the direction of the Ontario Court of Appeal, would not amount to proof beyond 
  a reasonable doubt of the charges before this Court [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[10] The Crown argues that the trial judge erred in law in his interpretation 
  of the decision of this court in Pezzo, by holding that evidence of excessive 
  speed alone can never support a conviction for dangerous driving. We agree.</p>
<p>
  [11] This court recognized in Pezzo that, under certain circumstances, evidence 
  of excessive speed, in itself, can constitute the offence of dangerous driving 
  (per Arnup J.A. at p. 531 and Gale, C.J.O. at p. 532). As properly recognized 
  by counsel for the respondent, that principle has been confirmed by this court 
  in various subsequent decisions, including in R. v. M. (M.K.) (1998), 35 M.V.R. 
  (3d) 319 in which this court said at p. 319: </p>
<p class="indent"> The trial judge concluded that in the circumstances the appellant's 
  excessive speed amounted to dangerous driving. The evidence at trial amply supported 
  his conclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">Depending on the context in which it occurred, excessive speed 
  can amount to a marked departure from the standard of care of a prudent driver.</p>
<p>
  [12] With respect, the trial judge's mistaken interpretation of Pezzo was a 
  serious error. Consequently, the verdict of acquittal cannot stand.</p>
<p>
  [13] The Crown submits that the facts here are essentially uncontroverted, and 
  that the findings of fact by the trial judge, which are said to be supported 
  by the evidence, are sufficient to permit this court to set aside the verdict 
  of acquittal and to substitute convictions on the two charges against the respondent 
  of dangerous driving causing death. The respondent argues that critical facts 
  in this case are in dispute, and that other key factual findings were not made 
  by the trial judge. In our view, there is substance to the respondent's argument.</p>
<p>
  [14] While the trial judge found that the respondent was travelling at a minimum 
  speed of 119 kilometres per hour when his vehicle left the highway, no opinion 
  evidence was led concerning the applicable increase to that minimum speed estimation 
  to be made when consideration of the impact with the pillar is taken into account. 
  The evidence of the lay witnesses indicated that the respondent's rate of speed 
  on impact was between 80 to 120 kilometres per hour. In addition, and of more 
  importance, there was evidence at trial from a police officer that, although 
  the posted speed in the area of the accident is 100 kilometres per hour, speeds 
  in the passing lane of up to 130 kilometres per hour are not uncommon. In the 
  slower right-hand lane, speeds range from 80 to 110 kilometres per hour, depending 
  on traffic.</p>
<p>
  [15] Accordingly, the respondent's actual rate of speed, which was not quantified 
  at trial, is a live issue. Given the evidence which indicated the speeding practices 
  of other drivers on the highway where the accident occurred, we are not persuaded 
  that the demonstrated evidence supports no conclusion other than the conclusion 
  that the respondent's driving was a marked departure from the standard of care 
  of a reasonable driver in a similar situation. A new trial must be held to determine 
  that central issue.</p>
<p>
  3. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [16] Accordingly, for the reasons given, we set aside the acquittal entered 
  by the trial judge and direct a new trial.</p>
