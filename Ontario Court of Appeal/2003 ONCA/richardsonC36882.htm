<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice Douglas J.A. Rutherford, 
  sitting with a jury, dated April 14, 1998.</p>
<p>
  O'CONNOR A.C.J.O.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The three appellants were convicted of first degree murder and sentenced 
  to life imprisonment with parole ineligibility for 25 years. They were also 
  convicted of four counts of kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault, assault causing 
  bodily harm and unlawful use of a firearm arising out of the same series of 
  events that gave rise to the murder convictions. Charges of unlawful confinement 
  and possession of a prohibited weapon were stayed.</p>
<p>
  [2] In all, the appellants raise seven grounds of appeal against their convictions. 
  The most significant grounds relate to the admissibility of a statement under 
  the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule and the trial judge's 
  charge on the co-conspirator's exception to the hearsay rule.</p>
<p>
  [3] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeals.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [4] It is not necessary to set out the facts in detail. However, a brief overview 
  of the circumstances of the offences will provide context for the discussion 
  of the grounds of appeal that follow. </p>
<p>
  [5] Late in the evening of October 25, 1995, the deceased, Sylvain Leduc, along 
  with three other victims were kidnapped and taken to an apartment on Banner 
  Road in Nepean, Ontario. Three of the victims, Leduc, Natalie Brindamour and 
  Daniel Chartrand were subjected to vicious assaults in the master bedroom. The 
  fourth victim, Melanie Rainville was bound, gagged and blindfolded and was confined 
  in a storage room in the apartment. </p>
<p>
  [6] Leduc and Chartrand were beaten into unconsciousness and Brindamour was 
  burned on her back, legs and inside her vagina with a red-hot curling iron. 
  The beatings only stopped because of the unexpected arrival of the police who 
  had been called by a neighbour. Leduc died as a result of the injuries inflicted 
  in the apartment.</p>
<p>
  [7] There was overwhelming evidence that the three appellants had been actively 
  involved in kidnapping and confining the four victims in the apartment. Indeed, 
  the appellants, Williams and Edwards, conceded that they were guilty of kidnapping, 
  unlawful confinement and, as parties, to assaults on Leduc and Chartrand. Edwards 
  also conceded guilt for manslaughter in Leduc's death.</p>
<p>
  [8] The evidence showed that, in addition to the appellants, a number of other 
  individuals, some of them young persons, were involved in the kidnappings and 
  the assaults. </p>
<p>
  [9] The Crown suggested three possible motives for these horrific events: one 
  was gang related, a second related to a racial slur and a third to a concern 
  about a set-up in connection with a debt of $400.</p>
<p>
  [10] At trial, the Crown's submission was that the appellants were guilty of 
  first degree murder in the death of Leduc, either as a planned and deliberate 
  act or by virtue of a murder committed in the course of an unlawful confinement 
  under s. 231(5)(e) of the Criminal Code. The thrust of the defence was that 
  the Crown had failed to establish that the appellants inflicted the assaults, 
  including the fatal beating of Leduc, or that they had formed the requisite 
  mens rea to commit murder.</p>
<p>
  [11] There was evidence which, if accepted, placed each of the appellants in 
  the master bedroom at various times during the course of the beatings. There 
  was also evidence of comments made by the appellants or comments made in their 
  presence supporting an inference of the intention to kill the four victims. 
  </p>
<p>
  [12] The appellants did not testify at trial, nor did they call any evidence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [13] The appellants do not argue that the convictions were unreasonable or that 
  they cannot be supported by the evidence. Rather, they take issue with the admissibility 
  of two pieces of evidence and the manner in which the trial judge instructed 
  the jury on a number of different points.</p>
<p>
  GROUND #1 - Past recollection recorded</p>
<p>
  (a) Background </p>
<p>
  [14] The appellants argue that the trial judge erred in admitting a portion 
  of a statement made by Natalie Brindamour to the police under the past recollection 
  recorded exception to the hearsay rule. Brindamour was a Crown witness at the 
  trial.</p>
<p>
  [15] In examination-in-chief, Brindamour testified about a conversation she 
  had with the appellant, Edwards, while he was leading her up the stairwell to 
  the apartment where the assaults were shortly to take place. She testified that 
  she asked Edwards where Melanie Rainville (one of the other victims) was and 
  he said, &quot;not to worry, she's okay&quot;. Then she asked Edwards what was 
  going on. He replied that if she co-operated, everything would be fine. At trial, 
  she could not recall any other conversation taking place in the stairwell. </p>
<p>
  [16] With a view to refreshing her memory about what else Edwards said to her 
  in the stairwell, the Crown directed Brindamour to a statement that she made 
  to the police approximately 16 hours after the events in issue. After reviewing 
  the statement, Brindamour testified that her memory was not refreshed. She could 
  not remember the additional conversation referred to in the statement. She testified, 
  however, that at the time she made the statement, the events were fresh in her 
  mind and that she was trying to be accurate and truthful. The trial was 2 &frac12; 
  years after the events. </p>
<p>
  [17] Following a voir dire, the trial judge ruled that the part of Brindamour's 
  statement which she could not remember was admissible as past recollection recorded. 
  Brindamour was then directed to read to the jury that part of her statement 
  in which she recounted the conversation with Edwards in the stairwell. It was 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  And he was showing me every stair, like, he was going, &quot;okay, there's another 
  stair here.&quot; Where it started, where it ended and where we turned. And 
  I said, &quot;I didn't say anything to no police, I haven't been talking to 
  nobody.&quot; And he goes, &quot;I know you haven't.&quot; And then I go, &quot;So 
  why are you guys doing this?&quot; He goes, &quot;It's too late now,&quot; he 
  goes, &quot;because we already picked up you and your cousin [Leduc]. &quot;So 
  then if we killed both of them then you're the only eyewitness left.&quot; And 
  I said, &quot;Where's Melanie [Rainville]?&quot; And he said, &quot;Don't worry 
  about Melanie.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [18] The statement in question was the second of three statements made by Brindamour 
  to the police. The details of each are set out in the Crown's factum in the 
  following manner (with alterations for clarity): </p>
<p class="indent"> The First Statement was made to Constable Adams on October 
  26, 1995 from 3:24 to 4:25 a.m., approximately one to two hours after the infliction 
  of her burns. The statement was taken in a patient cubicle at the hospital, 
  prior to Brindamour receiving any treatment. The officer recorded the statement 
  in his handwriting as Brindamour &quot;was in no condition to write that statement 
  on her own.&quot; She was &quot;traumatized&quot; and &quot;something less than 
  in control.&quot; The statement was 9 pages long.</p>
<p class="indent">The Second Statement was made to Detective MacDougall and Sergeant 
  Wisker on October 26, 1995 at 6:12 p.m., roughly 16 hours after Brindamour was 
  burned. By that time she had received medical attention. The statement was audio-taped 
  for an hour and 20 minutes and subsequently transcribed into a 58 page document. 
  Before the statement was made, Brindamour had spoken with Melanie Rainville 
  at the hospital. One of the topics discussed by the girls was Rainville's belief 
  that she had been abducted because Edwards viewed her attempt to collect the 
  $400 as a &quot;set up&quot;.</p>
<p class="indent">The Third Statement was made to Sergeants Balkwill and Lengacher 
  on October 28, 1995 between 7:40 and 9:00 p.m. It was audio-taped and transcribed 
  into a 72 page document. Brindamour wanted to speak with the police in order 
  to put names to the people whose conversations and actions were described in 
  her earlier statements.</p>
<p>
  [19] It was only in the second statement that Brindamour described the exchange 
  that took place in the stairwell, which was admitted as past recollection recorded. 
  In addition, she did not refer to that exchange when giving evidence at the 
  proceedings against the young offenders or at the appellants' preliminary hearings.</p>
<p>
  [20] In her testimony, Brindamour acknowledged that prior to providing the police 
  with her second statement, she spoke to Rainville at the hospital and that they 
  briefly discussed what had happened to each of them. However, Brindamour said 
  that they did not discuss her conversation with Edwards in the stairwell.</p>
<p>
  (b) The trial judge's ruling</p>
<p> [21] In admitting the challenged part of Brindamour's second statement as 
  past recollection recorded, the trial judge found: </p>
<ul>
  <li>it was not disputed that the transcription of the statement was accurate 
    and Brindamour vouched for its truth and accuracy;</li>
  <li>the passage of 16 hours between the events and their recording in the second 
    statement fell inside &quot;the traditional bounds within which the freshness 
    of the recollection gives rise to an assumption of reliability&quot;;</li>
  <li>although there was some conversation between Rainville and Brindamour at 
    the hospital before the second statement, there was &quot;no foundation on 
    which to suspect, however, that there could have been any contamination of 
    Ms. Brindamour's recollection of what transpired between her and Edwards &#133; 
    Ms. Rainville was not privy to that event and I cannot see how it could be 
    imagined that their limited conversation could have interfered in any way 
    with Ms. Brindamour's recollection of it&quot;; and</li>
  <li>Brindamour had 'an imperfect present recollection' of the communication 
    with Edwards and, while &quot;she does retain a present recollection of some 
    of the things that he said,&quot; that did not preclude her &quot;past recorded 
    recollection of the contentious exchange between her and Edwards&quot; from 
    being put before the jury.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [22] It is apparent that the trial judge accepted Brindamour's evidence that 
  she could not recall the critical part of the exchange in the stairwell, and 
  that she had been trying to be accurate and truthful when she made the statement 
  to the police.</p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge assessed the admissibility of the evidence against the 
  criteria for the admission of evidence under the past recollection recorded 
  exception to the hearsay rule. The trial judge's ruling preceded the Supreme 
  Court of Canada's decision in R. v. Starr (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449 and the 
  trial judge did not subject the evidence to an analysis under the principled 
  approach to the admission of hearsay evidence. </p>
<p>
  (c) Past recollection recorded</p>
<p>
  [24] Past recollection recorded is a well established exception to the hearsay 
  rule. Although the test has been described in different language over the years, 
  the essential conditions for admissibility are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Reliable record: The past recollection must have been recorded 
  in a reliable way. This requirement can be broken down into two separate considerations: 
  First, it requires the witness to have prepared the record personally, or to 
  have reviewed it for accuracy if someone else prepared it. Second, the original 
  record must be used if it is available.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Timeliness: The record must have been made or reviewed within 
  a reasonable time, while the event was sufficiently fresh in the witness's mind 
  to be vivid and likely accurate.</p>
<p class="indent">3. Absence of memory: At the time the witness testifies, he 
  or she must have no memory of the recorded events.</p>
<p class="indent">4. Present voucher as to accuracy: The witness, although having 
  no memory of the recorded events, must vouch for the accuracy of the assertions 
  in the record; in other words, the witness must be able to say that he or she 
  was being truthful at the time the assertions were recorded. </p>
<p>
  See R. v. Fliss (2002), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 225; Wigmore on Evidence (Chadbourn 
  rev., 1970) vol. 3 at para. 734-755; John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman and Alan 
  W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2d ed. (Toronto, Butterworths, 1999) 
  at para. 16.83-16.86.</p>
<p>
  [25] In my view, there was sufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable 
  him to conclude, as he did, that the four conditions required for the admission 
  of the statement on the basis of past recollection recorded were established.</p>
<p>
  [26] There is no issue as to the reliability of the record. The statement was 
  audio recorded and accurately transcribed.</p>
<p>
  [27] The timeliness requirement does not call for strict contemporaneity. It 
  is sufficient if the record is prepared close enough to the events to ensure 
  accuracy. The appropriate length of time will vary with the circumstances of 
  the case. The key is whether the events were fresh in the declarant's mind. 
  See R. v. Lauzon, [2000] O.J. No. 3940 (C.A.) (3 days); R. v. Weinberg, [1993] 
  O.J. No. 4041 (C.A.) (48 hours); R. v. Eisenhauer (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 37 
  (N.S.C.A.) (6 days). </p>
<p>
  [28] It was open to the trial judge in this case to conclude that the passage 
  of 16 hours between the events and the recording came within the acceptable 
  bounds to give rise to an assumption of reliability. There is nothing in the 
  evidence to suggest that the passage of time had affected the witness's ability 
  to recall the events accurately when she gave her second statement to the police.</p>
<p>
  [29] As to the absence of memory, Ms. Brindamour testified that she could not 
  recall the critical exchange and it is apparent that the trial judge accepted 
  her memory loss as genuine. </p>
<p>
  [30] The appellants argue, however, that because Ms. Brindamour had some recollection 
  of the events surrounding the challenged evidence, the absence of memory requirement 
  was not met. I disagree. The absence of memory requirement does not mean that 
  a statement is admissible as past recollection recorded only where the witness 
  has a total loss of memory regarding the relevant events. Wigmore at para. 734 
  sets out that the past recollection recorded exception can be used where the 
  witness &quot;is either devoid of a present recollection or possessed of an 
  imperfect present recollection&quot;. Wigmore went on to warn at para. 755 that 
  courts should avoid deploying these rules &quot;as inflexible dogmas&quot;. 
  </p>
<p>
  [31] The trial judge in this case relied on Wigmore to find that the exception 
  could apply where the witness has no recollection of a portion of the statement, 
  but remembers other parts of it. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal also cited 
  Wigmore in R. v. Eisenhauer, supra, and came to a similar conclusion. </p>
<p>
  [32] The fourth criterion, the need for a witness to vouch for the accuracy 
  of the statement was clearly satisfied in this case. In her examination-in-chief, 
  Ms. Brindamour testified that at the time she made the statement, she was being 
  truthful. </p>
<p>
  (d) The principled approach</p>
<p>
  [33] The appellants go on to argue that even if the statement in issue was properly 
  admitted under the common law exception for past recollection recorded, it nonetheless 
  did not satisfy the requirements of the principled approach to the admission 
  of hearsay evidence. They argue that following the Supreme Court of Canada's 
  decision in R. v. Starr, supra, the past recollection recorded criteria are 
  no longer determinative of admissibility.</p>
<p>
  [34] At the outset, it is important to note that in Starr, Iacobucci J. emphasized 
  the continued importance of the traditional hearsay exceptions. Even within 
  the principled approach to the admission of hearsay evidence, compliance with 
  a traditional exception is often indicative of admissibility. Importantly, the 
  past recollection recorded exception is grounded in a concern for reliability, 
  and compliance with the requirements of that exception, in my view, should weigh 
  strongly in favour of admissibility under the principled approach. </p>
<p>
  [35] It is worth noting that the Supreme Court decided R. v. Fliss, supra, after 
  Starr. In Fliss, Binnie J. analyzed the admissibility of the challenged evidence 
  against the criteria for past recollection recorded and did not suggest that 
  the exception should be changed to reflect the principled approach. </p>
<p>
  [36] In this case, the appellants did not argue strenuously that the necessity 
  criterion had not been met. Loss of memory has been found to satisfy that criterion: 
  R. v. C.C.F. (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (S.C.C.); R. v. Lauzon, supra. The 
  trial judge's conclusion that Ms. Brindamour had no present recollection of 
  the impugned exchange with Edwards in the stairwell satisfied the necessity 
  requirement.</p>
<p>
  [37] The requirement for threshold reliability involves identifying the specific 
  hearsay dangers inherent in admitting an out-of-court statement for its truth 
  and assessing whether the facts surrounding the hearsay statement provide sufficient 
  circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness to compensate for the hearsay dangers: 
  Starr, supra; R. v. K.G.B. (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [38] In my view, the circumstances of this case meet the threshold of reliability 
  requirement. Although the statement itself was not made under oath, Brindamour 
  did testify under oath that she was being truthful and accurate when she made 
  the statement. The statement was made when the details were fresh in Brindamour's 
  mind and the trial judge found that it was made voluntarily, without suggestive 
  or leading questions. The statement was accurately recorded. </p>
<p>
  [39] Importantly, defence counsel were able to conduct a full cross-examination 
  about the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement and how it was 
  that Brindamour could recall some events and not others. It is difficult to 
  imagine that the cross-examination would have been significantly different if 
  Brindamour had recalled the critical exchange and testified about it directly 
  rather than having it introduced through the past recollection recorded exception. 
  The jury had the opportunity of observing Brindamour giving her evidence, seeing 
  her demeanour and assessing her credibility.</p>
<p>
  [40] The appellants attach importance to the fact that Brindamour did not mention 
  the impugned exchange in her first and third statements to the police or when 
  testifying at the young offenders proceeding or at the appellants' preliminary 
  hearings. However, these were matters that went to the issue of the ultimate 
  reliability of the challenged statement. At trial, defence counsel vigorously 
  cross-examined Brindamour about why it was that she only recounted the exchange 
  in issue in the second statement to the police. The jurors were able to consider 
  her failures to mention the critical exchange on other occasions in determining 
  the weight to be attached to it. </p>
<p>
  [41] The appellants also argue that the statement in issue fails to meet the 
  threshold of reliability because it was tainted by the conversation that Brindamour 
  had with Rainville before making the second statement.</p>
<p>
  [42] The trial judge specifically addressed this argument and found that Brindamour's 
  conversation with Rainville did not contaminate her recollection of what transpired 
  between her and Edwards in the stairwell.</p>
<p>
  [43] In my view, there was ample evidence to support the trial judge's finding. 
  Rainville was not present in the stairwell when the impugned exchange took place 
  and Brindamour testified that she did not discuss what happened in the stairwell 
  with Rainville. Further, Brindamour's second statement, read as a whole, does 
  not lend support to the argument that Brindamour added the impugned exchange 
  to her story after speaking to Rainville in order to implicate Edwards. In other 
  parts of the same statement, she made comments about Edwards that were inconsistent 
  with an intention to unfairly implicate him in the offences. Indeed, she described 
  certain events in that statement, as she did on other occasions, which could 
  only be viewed as favourable to Edwards' position at trial. Moreover, the impugned 
  exchange in the stairwell is consistent with certain comments made by Edwards 
  in the truck on the way to the Banner Road apartment making it less likely that 
  Brindamour made up the exchange after speaking to Rainville.</p>
<p>
  [44] In summary, I am satisfied that the impugned portion of Brindamour's second 
  statement to the police was properly admissible under the principled approach 
  to the admission of hearsay evidence.</p>
<p>
  (e) The trial judge's charge</p>
<p>
  [45] In his charge to the jury, the trial judge commented that the jury was 
  &quot;only entitled to hear that kind of evidence [of past recollection recorded] 
  where it satisfied some particular conditions that at least objectively suggests 
  that it may be something on which you can rely.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [46] While it would have been better if the trial judge had not mentioned the 
  criteria governing the admissibility of this evidence to the jury, as they may 
  have taken the comment as an indication that special weight should be attached 
  to the evidence, I am nonetheless satisfied that the trial judge addressed any 
  possible prejudice arising from this comment. In his charge, he told the jury 
  that it was their task to determine what facts may be relied upon and what facts 
  may not and what weight was to be put on all the evidence. In his recharge, 
  the trial judge told the jury that they must &quot;consider very carefully&quot; 
  and give &quot;extra cautious scrutiny&quot; to the evidence of past recollection 
  recorded before placing reliance on it. He said that past recollection recorded 
  is a &quot;lower form of evidence&quot; because the witness cannot even recall 
  it and that, in contrast with other evidence, these statements were not given 
  under oath. </p>
<p>
  [47] In my view, the instructions to the jury satisfactorily addressed any prejudice 
  arising from the trial judge's comments about the admissibility of the past 
  recollection recorded evidence. </p>
<p>
  GROUND #2 - The co-conspirator's exception to the hearsay rule</p>
<p>
  [48] The appellants argue that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury 
  on the co-conspirator's exception to the hearsay rule.</p>
<p>
  [49] The co-conspirator's exception to the hearsay rule is not limited to charges 
  of conspiracy. It may also apply where it is alleged that an accused is a member 
  of a common design. Thus, the exception may operate in conjunction with an allegation 
  under s. 21(2 ) of the Criminal Code. </p>
<p>
  [50] In this case, the Crown alleged, and the evidence overwhelmingly supported, 
  that the three appellants were members of a common design to unlawfully confine 
  the four victims who were taken to the apartment on Banner Road. It was, therefore, 
  appropriate for the trial judge to instruct the jury on the possibility of finding 
  liability for murder and the assaults pursuant to s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code 
  and to also instruct them on the use of the co-conspirator's exception to the 
  hearsay rule.</p>
<p>
  [51] The appellants concede that the trial judge properly described the three-step 
  analysis for the admission of hearsay evidence in the context of a common enterprise 
  that is set out in R. v. Carter (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 568 (S.C.C.). However, 
  the appellants argue that the trial judge made two errors in instructing the 
  jury on how that analysis should be applied to this case. </p>
<p>
  [52] First, the appellants say that the trial judge erred in failing to review 
  the evidence on which the Crown relied to show that each appellant was linked 
  to the common design by his own acts or declarations - the second step in the 
  Carter approach. Although as a general rule, it is desirable for a trial judge 
  to review such evidence, it was not necessary to do so in this case. The appellants 
  Edwards and Williams conceded guilt for unlawful confinement and clearly were 
  acting jointly in the commission of that offence. The evidence against the appellant 
  Richardson that established that he was a member of the enterprise to confine 
  the four victims was overwhelming.</p>
<p>
  [53] There was no doubt that each of the appellants was a member of a common 
  design by virtue of his own acts or declarations. Indeed, if the trial judge 
  had reviewed all the relevant evidence, he would have emphasized evidence that 
  was not at all helpful to the position of the appellants. If anything, the trial 
  judge's failure to review such evidence enured to the benefit of the appellants. 
  </p>
<p>
  [54] The appellants also argue that the manner in which the trial judge charged 
  the jury on s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code, in conjunction with his charge on 
  the co-conspirator's exception, may have left the jury with the impression that 
  it was only necessary to prove the appellants guilt for the substantive offences 
  of murder and assault on a balance of probabilities. I disagree. </p>
<p>
  [55] As part of his charge on the use of the co-conspirator's exception to the 
  hearsay rule, the trial judge referred to the second step of the Carter approach 
  which requires the Crown to establish on a balance of probabilities that an 
  accused was linked to the common enterprise by evidence directly admissible 
  against that accused. The trial judge's charge made it clear that the use of 
  the balance of probabilities' onus was limited to the analysis necessary to 
  consider the admissibility of hearsay evidence and was not part of the analysis 
  in determining the issue of the overall guilt of the appellants.</p>
<p>
  [56] Throughout his charge, the trial judge repeatedly instructed the jury that 
  the onus was on the Crown to prove the appellants' guilt of the offences charged 
  beyond a reasonable doubt. The main issue at trial was the mens rea for murder. 
  The trial judge took great care in telling the jurors that the mens rea required 
  for murder was subjective, and that in order to find the appellants guilty, 
  they must be satisfied that the necessary mens rea had been established beyond 
  a reasonable doubt. In my view, there was no possibility that the jury may have 
  misunderstood the onus of proof required for findings of guilt.</p>
<p>
  GROUND #3 - Bad character evidence - Richardson </p>
<p>
  [57] The Crown led evidence about a conversation that took place on the evening 
  of October 25, 1995, shortly before the assaults occurred. In that conversation, 
  the appellant, Richardson, described an incident in the United States involving 
  a girl and a curling iron in what &quot;wasn't a nice context&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [58] The witness who recounted the curling iron conversation also testified 
  that she felt intimidated by Richardson, and as an explanation for her role 
  in the ensuing events, she was permitted to explain that her feeling of intimidation 
  resulted from Richardson's talk about gang-related incidents involving killing 
  and violence. </p>
<p>
  [59] The appellants concede that the discussion about the curling iron was properly 
  admitted into evidence. However, they argue that the evidence that the witness 
  was intimidated by Richardson and Richardson's description of the gang related 
  activities should not have been admitted as part of the Crown's case.</p>
<p>
  [60] In my view, there was no prejudice resulting from the fact that the Crown 
  was permitted to lead the challenged evidence as part of the examination-in-chief. 
  Defence counsel cross-examined the witness extensively about her role in the 
  events that took place in the apartment. That line of cross-examination led 
  to the witness's explanation about being afraid of Richardson. It seems likely 
  that the challenged evidence would have been before the jury, even if the Crown 
  had not led it as part of the examination-in-chief. In fact, it was for that 
  reason that the trial judge admitted the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [61] In any event, the trial judge properly instructed the jury in his charge 
  that they could not use evidence that the appellants were involved with gangs 
  to conclude that they were more likely to have done what they were charged with. 
  That was a proper limiting instruction. There was no objection to this part 
  of the charge and, in particular, defence counsel did not ask the trial judge 
  to instruct the jury further with respect to the limited use that could be made 
  of the specific comments about gang-related activities attributed to Richardson.</p>
<p>
  [62] I see no merit to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  GROUND #4 - Omissions</p>
<p>
  [63] The trial judge instructed the jury that liability pursuant to s. 21(1)(b) 
  and (c) of the Criminal Code could be based on acts or omissions. However, he 
  did not specifically say that liability based on omissions can only arise where 
  there is an omission in circumstances where there is a legal duty to act . See 
  R. v. Nixon (1990), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (B.C.C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [64] The Crown's theory of liability was not based on an omissions theory. The 
  Crown's theory and the evidence pointed to all three appellants as active participants 
  in the kidnapping and unlawful confinement. There was sufficient evidence to 
  establish party liability for murder and for the assaults on the basis of the 
  appellants' actions, assuming the jury concluded that they possessed the requisite 
  intent and that they intended that their actions would aid or abet the assailants.</p>
<p>
  [65] In his charge, the trial judge did not emphasize the omissions aspect of 
  party liability under s. 21(1)(b) and (c). Indeed, the trial judge made clear 
  on several occasions that mere passive acquiescence or being a bystander was 
  not enough for party liability. Rather than leaving open the possibility of 
  a finding based on an omission, the trial judge told the jury that there must 
  be some actual participation, assistance rendered or active encouraging or urging 
  that the offence be carried out. A mere bystander, he said, was not an aider 
  or abetter.</p>
<p>
  [66] I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  GROUND #5 - The review of the evidence/position of the defence </p>
<p>
  [67] The appellants argue that the trial judge erred in failing to adequately 
  review the positions of the defence and in particular the evidence in support 
  of those positions. </p>
<p>
  [68] I see no error in this regard. This case was not factually complex. The 
  positions of the Crown and the defence were relatively straightforward. The 
  jurors were permitted to take notes throughout the trial and they heard lengthy 
  addresses from counsel. In his charge, the trial judge specifically incorporated 
  by reference the defence addresses to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [69] Moreover, during the course of the charge, the trial judge reviewed the 
  positions of the appellants separately and made reference to key evidence relied 
  upon by each in support of the defence theories. </p>
<p>
  [70] The defence was essentially that the Crown had failed to prove the charges 
  against the appellants and was premised mainly on the lack of credibility or 
  reliability of key Crown witnesses. The trial judge at different points in his 
  charge specifically addressed the defence positions. He alerted the jury to 
  discrepancies in the testimony of Crown witnesses and the need for care in assessing 
  the weight to be attached to the various witnesses' evidence. He spoke of the 
  lack of memory of some witnesses, the criminal record of some and Brindamour's 
  motivation to implicate the appellants. </p>
<p>
  [71] In my view, the jury was adequately alerted to particular parts of the 
  evidence that related to the positions taken by the appellants and I see no 
  merit to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  GROUND #6 - Section 231(5)(e)</p>
<p>
  [72] The appellants argue that the trial judge failed to adequately instruct 
  the jury as to the degree of participation required for first degree murder 
  pursuant to s. 231(5)(e) of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>
  [73] The trial judge's charge carefully tracked the five-step approach to s. 
  231(5) set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Harbottle (1993), 84 
  C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 14.</p>
<p>
  [74] In dealing with s. 231(5), the trial judge told the jury that in order 
  to find the accused guilty of first degree murder, it was necessary for the 
  Crown to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the underlying crime of domination, 
  that is forcible confinement. He continued: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The person must be guilty of the forcible confinement. The accused must also 
  be guilty of murder by being a party, either committing it or aiding or abetting 
  it or being a party by subsection (2) of 21. The accused must have been shown 
  to have participated - and this is the crux of it - in the murder in such a 
  manner that he was the substantial cause of the death of the victim. </p>
<p>
  [75] In my view, the trial judge's instruction was proper and I see no merit 
  to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  GROUND #7 - Available verdicts</p>
<p>
  [76] The appellants submit that the trial judge failed to adequately instruct 
  the jury as to the available verdicts against each of the appellants regarding 
  the charge of first degree murder.</p>
<p>
  [77] I am satisfied that the trial judge properly set out the available verdicts. 
  He instructed the jury that they could find the appellants guilty of first or 
  second degree murder or manslaughter. He also told the jury that they had to 
  consider each count as it related to each accused separately. The trial judge 
  properly defined first and second degree murder and manslaughter, and correctly 
  explained the application of subsections 21(1) and (2) and the test under s. 
  231(5)(e) for first degree murder.</p>
<p>
  [78] I see no merit to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [79] For the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeals of each of the appellants.</p>
