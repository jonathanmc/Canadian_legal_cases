<p>On appeal from the decision of Justice Clair Marchand of the Summary Conviction 
  Appeal Court dated July 22, 2002, setting aside the acquittal entered by Justice 
  Jon-Jo Douglas dated December 3, 2001. </p>
<p>
  WEILER J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] We dismissed this appeal at the conclusion of the argument and indicated 
  that the reasons would follow. These are the reasons.</p>
<p>[2] The issues in this case are whether the right of the appellant, Mr. Richfield, 
  to counsel under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms s. 10(b) was breached 
  and whether the evidence obtained as a result of that breach ought to be excluded 
  pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. </p>
<p>A. The Background</p>
<p>
  [3] The underlying facts are succinctly summarized in the Crown&#146;s factum 
  at paras. 4, 5 and 6, as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">4. On April 16, 2001, at 1:00 a.m., the appellant was arrested 
  by Constable McCrea after failing a roadside breath screening test. At 1:07 
  a.m., the appellant was advised of his right to retain and instruct counsel 
  without delay and he indicated that he understood that right. He then stated 
  that he wished to speak with a particular lawyer (Lonnie Mark). At 1:09 a.m., 
  the officer read him the caution and the breath sample demand.</p>
<p class="indent">5. Constable McCrea then transported the appellant to Barrie 
  Police Service in order to facilitate the breathalyser demand, arriving at 1:35 
  a.m. At 1:42 a.m., after the appellant was paraded before the duty sergeant, 
  Constable McCrea placed a phone call for Mr. Mark, having located a phone number 
  from the Lawyers&#146; Handbook. He received the answering service for Mr. Mark 
  which was staffed by a live person. Constable McCrea left a message with that 
  person with the information of the appellant&#146;s arrest. Anticipating a quick 
  call back from the answering service or Mr. Mark, Constable McCrea placed the 
  appellant in the print room, next to the booking room. After waiting 20 to 30 
  minutes, Constable McCrea placed the appellant in a cell and attended to the 
  administrative duties of the case.</p>
<p class="indent">6. Constable McCrea retrieved the appellant from the cell at 
  2:44 a.m. At that point, one hour and 45 minutes had lapsed from the time of 
  the arrest and there had been no call back from Mr. Mark or the answering service 
  in the hour since the call had been placed. Constable McCrea advised the appellant 
  that his lawyer had not called back and he asked if he would like to speak to 
  duty counsel. The appellant stated that he did not want to speak to duty counsel; 
  he only wanted to speak to Mr. Mark. Constable McCrea advised the appellant 
  that a demand was going to be made shortly to provide samples of his breath 
  and if he was going to get advice from counsel that he should do so now prior 
  to the demand. He further explained that duty counsel is a lawyer that is provided 
  by the government free of charge, that they can be contacted 24 hours a day, 
  and it is specifically set up for people in his situation to get advice before 
  they make decisions that may affect him. The appellant disregarded that advice. 
  Conscious of the two hour period within which a breath sample had to be taken 
  in order for the prosecution to be able to rely on the evidentiary presumption 
  in section 258(1)(d) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, and in the 
  face of these refusals, he handed the appellant over to Constable Middleton, 
  the breath technician. At Constable Middleton&#146;s request, the appellant 
  agreed to provide the breath samples. When Constable Middleton handed the appellant 
  back, counsel still had not phoned.</p>
<p>[4] The trial judge found that there was a breach of the appellant&#146;s right 
  to counsel of his choice and held that the breathalyzer results should be excluded 
  under s. 24(2) because the admission of the results would be contrary to R. 
  v. Stillman (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.). As a result of the evidence 
  being excluded, the appellant was acquitted.</p>
<p>[5] On the Crown&#146;s appeal from the appellant&#146;s acquittal, the summary 
  conviction appeal judge upheld the trial judge&#146;s finding that the appellant&#146;s 
  right to counsel had been breached. Although he did not specifically say that 
  the trial judge erred in principle in relation to his s. 24(2) analysis, it 
  was implicit in his conclusion that he considered that the trial judge had done 
  so. The summary conviction appeal judge considered the three factors applicable 
  to a s. 24(2) analysis, namely: (i) the fairness of the trial; (ii) the seriousness 
  of the Charter violation, and, as he put it, (iii) the possibility that the 
  administration of justice could be brought into disrepute by excluding the evidence 
  even though it was obtained in violation of the Charter. He held that the evidence 
  should be admitted and directed a new trial. The appellant appealed.</p>
<p>B. The Right to Counsel </p>
<p> [6] A person detained by the police must be provided with a reasonable opportunity 
  to exercise the right to counsel, and, except in cases of urgency or danger, 
  the police must refrain from eliciting evidence from the detainee until he or 
  she has had that reasonable opportunity. The detained or arrested person who 
  is offered the opportunity to contact counsel and asserts his right to a &quot;particular 
  counsel&quot; must, however, exercise the right diligently. R. v. Bartle (1994), 
  92 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.) per Lamer C.J.C. at 301; R. v. Brydges (1990), 53 
  C.C.C. (3d) 330 (S.C.C.) per Lamer J. at 341; R. v. Smith (1989), 50 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 308 (S.C.C.) per Lamer J. at 313; R. v. Black (1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 1 
  (S.C.C.) per Wilson J. at 13-14.</p>
<p>[7] Whether legal advice has been sought diligently by the detained person 
  depends on the context of the situation. The element of reasonableness in furnishing 
  a detainee with the opportunity to retain and instruct counsel necessarily excludes 
  the concept of an absolute right to counsel of choice. As Lamer J. (as he then 
  was) noted in R. v. Ross (1989), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) at 135: </p>
<p class="indent">Although an accused or detained person has the right to choose counsel, it 
  must be noted that, as this court said in R. v. Tremblay (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 
  565 (S.C.C.), a detainee must be reasonably diligent in the exercise of these 
  rights, and if he is not, the correlative duties imposed on the police and set 
  out in Mannien (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.), are suspended. Reasonable 
  diligence in the exercise of the right to choose one's counsel depends upon 
  the context facing the accused or detained person. On being arrested, for example, 
  the detained person is faced with an immediate need for legal advice and must 
  exercise reasonable diligence accordingly. By contrast, when seeking the best 
  lawyer to conduct a trial, the accused person faces no such immediacy. Nevertheless, 
  accused or detained persons have a right to choose their counsel and it is only 
  if the lawyer chosen cannot be available within a reasonable time that the detainee 
  or the accused should be expected to exercise the right to counsel by calling 
  another lawyer.</p>

<p>[8] In considering whether the appellant has been given a reasonable opportunity 
  to exercise the right to counsel and has acted exercised this right with reasonable 
  diligence, the existence of 24 hour duty counsel services is a crucial factor 
  that must be considered. In R. v. Brydges, supra at 350-351, the Supreme Court 
  of Canada recognized that the existence of a duty counsel system may affect 
  what constitutes &#147;reasonable diligence&#148;: </p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, if the purpose of s.10(b) is to assist initially persons upon their 
  being detained as regards their rights and as regards their exercise thereof, 
  we might well have to put time-limits, not on access to counsel, but on access 
  to counsel of one's choice. It may be that it is unreasonable not to seek the 
  advice of available counsel when the only one available is either duty counsel 
  or a Legal Aid Lawyer. We must not, as a court, lose sight of the realities 
  of crime investigation and the functioning of modern police forces of varying 
  sizes, with shifts, labour agreements and limitations put on overtime for financial 
  considerations of course, but also, if not more important because police officers 
  have a right to a personal and family life. Waiting for eight to ten hours for 
  counsel of the detainee's choice to become available may not be justified in 
  a purposive approach when duty counsel has been available all along... [A]s 
  a corollary to the obligation imposed on the police to inform detainees of the 
  existence and availability of duty counsel services and Legal Aid plans, there 
  may have to be an adjustment to the meaning of &#147;reasonable diligence&#148; 
  [ emphasis added].</p>
<p>[9] Similarly in R. v. Prosper (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.) at 367 and 
  375, Chief Justice Lamer, for the majority, held: </p>
<p class="indent"> In addition, provision of duty counsel would seem to offer concrete benefits 
  to law enforcement authorities and to the courts. That is, not only does ensuring 
  that legal advice is available at the outset save time and allow police to proceed 
  more quickly with their investigatory work and with laying charges, but also 
  it is likely to facilitate the admission into evidence of various statements 
  made to police by detained persons. &#147;Brydges duty counsel&#148; is also 
  likely, at least in the long run, to be cost efficient. It would decrease the 
  overtime costs associated with having police &#147;hold off&#148; to provide 
  the necessary &quot;reasonable opportunity&quot; to contact counsel and, by 
  reducing the number of motions which centre around ss.10(b) and 24(2) of the 
  Charter, would help to save on court resources. </p>
<p>. . . . </p>
<p>In my view, what constitutes a &#147;reasonable opportunity&#148; will depend 
  on all the surrounding circumstances. These circumstances will include the availability 
  of duty counsel services in the jurisdiction where the detention takes place. 
  As the majority in Brydges suggested (at p.350), the existence of duty counsel 
  services may affect what constitutes &#147;reasonable diligence&#148; of a detainee 
  in pursuing the right to counsel, which will in turn affect the length of the 
  period during which the state authorities' s.10(b) implementational duties will 
  require them to &#147;hold off&#148; from trying to elicit incriminatory evidence 
  from the detainee [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>[10] The trial judge in this case failed to appreciate the significance of 
  the availability of duty counsel as a factor in determining whether the appellant 
  exercised his right to counsel with reasonable diligence in making his ruling 
  that there was a breach of the appellant&#146;s s. 10(b) Charter rights. In 
  so doing, the trial judge committed a palpable and overriding error and the 
  summary conviction appeal judge erred in upholding his decision.</p>
<p>[11] It may be that initially the police were not as diligent as they could 
  have been in facilitating the appellant&#146;s access to counsel of his choice 
  after calling the lawyer&#146;s number and getting the answering service. They 
  could have called the lawyer&#146;s number again or tried to find his home telephone 
  number in the phone book. However, the police waited for over an hour for the 
  lawyer to call back and during that time the police refrained from making any 
  further demands upon the appellant. More importantly, the police followed up 
  in trying to make counsel available to the appellant. When the lawyer had not 
  phoned back, the police offered the appellant the assistance of duty counsel. 
</p>
<p>[12] The appellant, upon being informed that the lawyer that he had asked the 
  police to call had not called back, did not ask to make a further call to his 
  counsel of choice or to another counsel. When asked if he wished the assistance 
  of duty counsel, the appellant indicated that he did not. The appellant was 
  not reasonably diligent in exercising his right to counsel in the circumstances. 
  The fact that the police could have made greater efforts earlier does not detract 
  from the appellant&#146;s own lack of diligence at a later stage in exercising 
  his right to counsel. </p>
<p>[13] At trial, the officer was asked what he would have done had the appellant 
  indicated that he wanted to speak to duty counsel, that is, whether the officer 
  would have waited before making a demand that the appellant give a sample of 
  his breath. This question called for speculation on the part of the officer 
  and the answer has no bearing on this appeal. </p>
<p>C. Section 24(2)</p>
<p>
  [14] Because of our decision that there was ultimately no breach of the appellant&#146;s 
  s. 10(b) Charter right, it is unnecessary to decide whether the evidence should 
  have been excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. We note, however, that 
  in giving his reasons why the evidence should not be excluded pursuant to s. 
  24(2), the summary conviction appeal judge observed that the appellant did not 
  really have much choice about providing a breath sample because even if he had 
  contacted a lawyer, he would have been given the advice to submit to a breathalyzer. 
  This was not a proper consideration and ought not to have formed part of his 
  s. 24(2) analysis: R. v. Bartle, supra, at 319-320.</p>
<p>[15] On the other hand, in considering whether to admit the evidence under 
  s. 24(2), the summary conviction appeal judge considered and balanced the three 
  factors that normally form part of the s. 24(2) analysis. The trial judge did 
  not go through the analysis of the three groups of factors because he considered 
  that he was compelled by Stillman to automatically exclude the evidence. </p>
<p>[16] In Stillman, Cory J., writing for the majority, said that the compelled 
  provision of bodily substances in breach of Charter rights for purposes of self-incrimination 
  will generally result in an unfair trial and, therefore, the evidence should 
  be excluded. However, Cory J. pointed out at p. 356 of Stillman that some procedures, 
  such as fingerprinting and breath samples, are so unintrusive and so routinely 
  performed that, even when performed as a result of a Charter violation, they 
  may be an exception to the general exclusionary rule for conscripted evidence. 
  This is because the Criminal Code provisions pertaining to breath samples are 
  &#147;both minimally intrusive and essential to the control of the tragic chaos 
  caused by drinking and driving.&#148; </p>
<p>[17] The summary conviction appeal judge specifically referred to the passage 
  in Stillman in which Cory J. addressed the minimally intrusive nature of the 
  provision of breath samples. It is apparent that the summary conviction appeal 
  judge concluded that the breach of the appellant&#146;s Charter right was minor 
  and that the intrusion upon the appellant&#146;s dignity and privacy was minimal.</p>
<p>[18] The general rule that conscripted evidence obtained in violation of an 
  accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights should automatically be excluded because it 
  impacts on trial fairness has the advantage of predictability. This general 
  rule may, however, provide a disproportionate remedy when the resulting Charter 
  violation is minimal. See D.M. Paciocco, &quot;Stillman, Disproportion and the 
  Fair Trial Dichotomy under Section 24(2)&quot; (1997) 2 Can. Crim. L.R. 163. 
  In Stillman,, Cory J. also commented, at p. 351, that although the admission 
  of conscriptive evidence would generally render a trial unfair, &quot;[t]hat 
  general rule, like all rules, may be subject to rare exceptions.&quot; Other 
  obiter comments by the Supreme Court, in R. v. Fliss (2002), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 
  225 at 247-8 and R. v. Law (2002), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 465, suggest that 
  the Supreme Court may be prepared to modify its approach to the automatic exclusion 
  of conscriptive evidence obtained through a minor breach of Charter rights. 
  See also P. Cory, &quot;General Principles of Charter Exclusion (Exclusion of 
  Conscriptive and Non-Conscriptive Evidence)&quot; (1998) 47 U.N.B.L.J. 229 at 
  236. That said, as we have indicated, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether 
  the summary conviction appeal judge's conclusion that the trial judge erred 
  in excluding the evidence under s. 24(2) was correct and we do not do so.</p>
<p>D. Disposition </p>
<p>
  [19] Having concluded that the appellant&#146;s s. 10 (b) Charter rights were 
  not breached, I would therefore dismiss the appeal. </p>
