<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Bonnie L. Croll of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated February 27, 2002.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] Section 19(1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, S.O.R./97-175 (the 
  &quot;Guidelines&quot;), authorizes a court to &quot;impute such amount of income 
  to a spouse as it considers appropriate in the circumstances&quot;. One of the 
  circumstances a court may consider is whether &quot;the spouse is intentionally 
  under-employed or unemployed&quot;. This appeal invites consideration of this 
  provision in the context of a spouse who claims that he gave up a high income 
  derived from his independent electrical contracting business in favour of a 
  salaried position with a different company which generated a significantly lower 
  income.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appeal also raises the issue of a trial judge's discretion to &quot;gross 
  up&quot; imputed income from corporate sources to take into account the sometimes 
  substantial differences in tax liability between this category of income and 
  personal income.</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  (1) The parties and the events</p>
<p>
  [3] Frederick Riel (&quot;Riel&quot;) and Jan Holland (&quot;Holland&quot;) 
  were married on December 14, 1981. They separated 16 years later, on September 
  5, 1997. There are two children of the marriage, Amanda, born September 3, 1984, 
  and Christopher, born January 21, 1988.</p>
<p>
  [4] After their separation, Riel and Holland entered into Minutes of Settlement 
  on November 17, 1998, which became a consent judgment on the same date. The 
  Minutes of Settlement required Riel to pay monthly child support of $1732, based 
  on his represented income of $147,250. Riel was also required to pay Christopher's 
  hockey costs and an equivalent amount for Amanda's expenses and spousal support 
  of $150 per month, indexed to a cost of living adjustment.</p>
<p>
  [5] Riel is an electrician by trade. In 1982, he and Holland incorporated Dominion 
  Electric and Equipment which bought and sold electrical equipment. This company 
  was closed in 1994. In the same year, a new company was incorporated, Dominion 
  Electric (Canada) Ltd. (&quot;Dominion Electric&quot;), with Riel as the sole 
  shareholder. This new company did regular electrical contracting work.</p>
<p>
  [6] At trial, Riel claimed that in the summer of 2000 he ceased operating Dominion 
  Electric as an independent electrical contractor and took a salaried position 
  with Markham Electric at $52,500 per year plus a car allowance of $450.00 per 
  month. Although this job was personal in nature, Riel submitted invoices through 
  Dominion Electric and payments were made to Dominion Electric, not Riel.</p>
<p>
  [7] In January 2001, Riel terminated his relationship with Markham Electric 
  and took a salaried position with Lawrcon Electric Machine Corporation (&quot;Lawrcon 
  Electric&quot;) at $55,000 annually. Once again, he organized matters so that 
  payments were made to Dominion Electric.</p>
<p>
  (2) The litigation</p>
<p>
  [8] On November 27, 2000, Riel brought an application to reduce his child support 
  obligation to $912 per month. He also asked to reduce his obligations for Christopher's 
  hockey and Amanda's expenses.</p>
<p>
  [9] Section 12 of the Guidelines authorizes a court to order a spouse to provide 
  security for the payment of a child support order. On March 8, 2001, Ferrier 
  J. made an interim order permitting Holland to register charging orders of $50,000 
  each against Riel's cottage and home. At trial, Riel sought to have the charging 
  orders discharged.</p>
<p>
  [10] Holland brought a cross-application requesting that Riel's application 
  be dismissed for failure to make proper disclosure and failure to comply with 
  support obligations. In the alternative, she requested child support in accordance 
  with the Guidelines and an increase in spousal support. In addition, Holland 
  questioned whether Riel had actually closed down Dominion Electric's business 
  operations.</p>
<p>
  [11] The application and cross-application, including testimony by the parties, 
  were heard by Croll J. over the course of three days in November and December 
  2001. The trial judge released comprehensive reasons for judgment on February 
  23, 2002.</p>
<p>
  [12] On the central issue of Riel's current income, the trial judge rejected 
  Riel's submission that it should be the $55,000 salary he was receiving from 
  Lawrcon Electric. After a careful and detailed analysis of Riel's and Dominion 
  Electric's available financial records, she determined that Riel used Dominion 
  Electric as a vehicle for paying personal expenses and that the real income 
  available to Riel when he operated Dominion Electric as an independent electrical 
  contracting business was $78,706 in 1998, $127,178 in 1999 and $132,000 in 2000. 
  The trial judge acknowledged that some of her figures might be somewhat generous. 
  However, she found that this was due to &quot;the completely inadequate disclosure 
  that colors this entire proceeding&quot; and that Riel &quot;must accept any 
  adverse inferences that result from his failure to disclose&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [13] The trial judge then stated that her detailed analysis of these records 
  would be irrelevant if she accepted Riel's submission that he earned only $55,000 
  from his salaried position with Lawrcon Electric. However, she rejected this 
  submission: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am not persuaded that this is the case. I note that the financial statement 
  sworn by Mr. Riel on October 9, 1997 stated that his income was $18,000, yet 
  on cross-examination he said his income at that time was between $40,000 and 
  $60,000. This is further inconsistent with the numbers Mr. Riel uses to calculate 
  money available to him in 1997. In other words, Mr. Riel has provided three 
  different answers to the question of his available income in 1997. In addition 
  &#133; there was no reason for Mr. Riel to wind down Dominion Electric. Even 
  on his numbers, the income available to Mr. Riel went from $41,649 in 1998, 
  to $111,149 in 1999 to almost $73,000 in 2000, a year in which he says that 
  he did not work the entire 12 months. Even accepting that 1999 was an unusually 
  good year, there is no evidence of a gross decline in funds available to Mr. 
  Riel such that, on an objective basis, the business had to be discontinued. 
  The business may have been difficult, and challenging, but to his credit, the 
  numbers imply that Mr. Riel was able to meet the challenge.</p>
<p>
  [14] Based on this analysis, the trial judge concluded that Riel was 'intentionally 
  underemployed' within the meaning of s. 19(1) of the Guidelines. She then applied 
  s. 17(1) of the Guidelines which permits an averaging of the last three years 
  of a spouse's income. She said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Mr. Riel asks the court to accept that, despite what he may have earned in earlier 
  years, he earns less now. I am not satisfied that this is the case, and, in 
  my view, the three-year averaging is the most reliable indicator of Mr. Riel's 
  current income.</p>
<p>
  [15] The trial judge then noted that Riel's use of a corporate vehicle to earn 
  income and pay personal expenses in 1998, 1999 and 2000 resulted in substantial 
  tax savings for him. This meant that Riel had significantly more real income 
  than he would have had if he had been required to pay tax on personal income 
  in the high figures he had earned during the 1998-2000 period. She reasoned: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Accordingly &#133; I find that the income for the year 1998 should be grossed 
  up from $78,706 to approximately $125,000, for the year 1999 from $127,178 to 
  $215,000 and for the year 2000 from $132,000 to $224,000. The average of these 
  three grossed up amounts is $188,000. This is the income to be imputed to Mr. 
  Riel for the year 2001 pursuant to section 17(1) of the Guidelines. On an income 
  of $188,000, the child support guidelines provide for child support of $2156.20 
  per month.</p>
<p>
  [16] On the security issue raised by Riel, the trial judge decided that the 
  charging orders against Riel's home and cottage properties should remain in 
  place.</p>
<p>
  [17] Finally, the trial judge dismissed Holland's cross-application for an increase 
  in spousal support.</p>
<p>
  [18] Riel appeals from the trial judge's conclusions on the 'intentional underemployment', 
  'grossing up' of imputed income and security for support issues. Holland Cross-appeals 
  from the trial judge's disposition of the spousal support issue.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [19] The issues on the appeal and Cross-appeal are: </p>
<p class="indent"> Appeal</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Did the trial judge err by determining that Riel was 'intentionally 
  underemployed' within the meaning of s. 19(1) of the Guidelines?</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Did the trial judge err by 'grossing up' Riel's income to 
  take account of the circumstance that Riel paid very little tax on his business 
  income?</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Did the trial judge err by continuing the charging orders 
  imposed by Ferrier J. as security for spousal and child support payments?</p>
<p class="indent">Cross-appeal</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Did the trial judge err by refusing to increase the spousal 
  support payment?</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  Appeal issues</p>
<p>
  (1) The 'intentional underemployment' issue</p>
<p>
  [20] Section 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  19.(1) The court may impute such amount of income to a spouse as it considers 
  appropriate in the circumstances, which circumstances include the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) The spouse is intentionally underemployed or unemployed . . . .</p>
<p>
  [21] The trial judge invoked this provision. She could see no reason for Riel 
  to abandon his successful and reasonably lucrative independent electrical contracting 
  business in favour of a position as an employee with another company at a greatly 
  reduced income.</p>
<p>
  [22] Riel contends that the trial judge erred in two respects: first, by giving 
  no or insufficient weight to Riel's explanation for the change in his employment 
  status; and second, by refusing to admit into evidence an expert's report which 
  Riel wanted to use to corroborate his contention that he acted reasonably, from 
  a financial standpoint, in not continuing his independent electrical contracting 
  business.</p>
<p>
  [23] I do not agree with these submissions. Riel's explanation for his decision 
  to take a salaried position with another company - lack of credit, difficulty 
  financing jobs, bad debts, trouble finding big jobs due to a lack of regular 
  employees - was belied by the strong financial results of Dominion Electric 
  in 1998, 1999 and 2000. I agree with the appellant's submission that &quot;the 
  numbers are not everything&quot; in an 'intentional underemployment' analysis. 
  However, the numbers must certainly be an important part of the analysis. Here, 
  Riel claims that he made an employment decision that he says reduced his income 
  by more than half. He coupled that decision with an almost immediate attempt 
  to seek a reduction by almost half in his child support payments. It seems to 
  me that an employment decision that would lead to two children receiving $912 
  instead of $1732 per month needs to be justified in a compelling way. There 
  was nothing in Riel's conduct or testimony that came close to providing such 
  a justification.</p>
<p>
  [24] I note that this court considered the meaning of 'intentional underemployment' 
  in Drygala v. Pauli (2002), 219 D.L.R. (4th) 319. Gillese J.A. said, at p. 328: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Read in context and given its ordinary meaning, &quot;intentionally&quot; means 
  a voluntary act. The parent required to pay is intentionally underemployed if 
  that parent chooses to earn less than he or she is capable of earning.</p>
<p>
  In my view, Riel's employment decision in 2000 - a decision he has maintained 
  since then - fits precisely within this definition.</p>
<p>
  [25] Nor do I see any basis for disagreeing with the trial judge's ruling excluding 
  the expert report the appellant sought to introduce. The reasons in support 
  of her ruling - the duplication between the expert's financial analysis and 
  Riel's own information, the absence of backup documentation for the report and 
  the irrelevance of the expert's opinion on the legal question of 'intentional 
  underemployment' - are, in my view, entirely sound.</p>
<p>
  (2) The 'grossing up' issue</p>
<p>
  [26] The appellant reaches this submission only if he is unsuccessful on his 
  first ground of appeal. The premises of this second submission are that the 
  trial judge was correct to calculate Riel's income as the pre-tax income of 
  his independent electrical contracting business and that she was also correct 
  to employ the three year averaging (1998-2000) of that income.</p>
<p>
  [27] The appellant relies on s. 18 of the Guidelines in support of his position 
  on this issue. Section 18 provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> 18. (1) Where a spouse is a shareholder, director or officer 
  of a corporation and the court is of the opinion that the amount of the spouse's 
  annual income as determined under section 16 does not fairly reflect all the 
  money available to the spouse for the payment of child support, the court may 
  consider the situations described in section 17 and determine the spouse's annual 
  income to include</p>
<p class="indent">(a) all or part of the pre-tax income of the corporation, and 
  of any corporation . . . for the most recent taxation year; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) an amount commensurate with the services that the spouse 
  provides to the corporation, provided that the amount does not exceed the corporation's 
  pre-tax income.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) In determining the pre-tax income of a corporation for the 
  purposes of subsection (1), all amounts paid by the corporation as salaries, 
  wages or management fees, or other payments or benefits, to or on behalf of 
  persons with whom the corporation does not deal at arm's length must be added 
  to the pre-tax income, unless the spouse establishes that the payments were 
  reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [28] The appellant contends that this provision imposes a cap or ceiling on 
  the use a court may make of a spouse's income from a corporation. The ceiling, 
  explicit in both subparagraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section 18(1), is the corporation's 
  pre-tax income including any 'add-ons' flowing from s. 18(2). Accordingly, the 
  appellant submits, once the trial judge determined that the pre-tax income of 
  Dominion Electric was $78,706 for 1998, $127,178 for 1999 and $132,000 for 2000, 
  that was the end of the exercise. Section 18(1) of the Guidelines precluded 
  a further 'grossing up' of these amounts to take account of the reality that 
  Riel, through Dominion Electric, paid very little tax on this income.</p>
<p>
  [29] I do not agree with the appellant's argument that s. 18 of the Guidelines 
  is, in effect, a code with respect to income derived from a corporation. I begin 
  by noting the stark difference in the income taxes paid by Riel and the income 
  taxes that would be paid by a salaried employee. In 1998, Riel paid income tax 
  of $3110. In 1999, he paid income tax of $4467. Riel did not disclose his income 
  tax for 2000.</p>
<p> [30] At the trial, the trial judge admitted into evidence, and relied on, 
  a report by Melanie Russell, a chartered accountant, who calculated the amount 
  of pre-tax income required to realize several levels of income after the payment 
  of personal income taxes: </p>

</table>
<p>[31] It is clear from the juxtaposition of the actual tax paid by Riel and 
  Ms. Russell's table that Riel derives a substantial benefit from organizing 
  his affairs under a corporate umbrella and using the corporation to pay personal 
  expenses.</p>
<p>
  [32] In a series of decisions, judges of the Superior Court have 'grossed up' 
  a spouse's income to take account of similar striking differences in tax consequences 
  between salaried employees and persons in receipt of other forms of income: 
  see Orser v. Grant, [2000] O.J. No. 1669; Moran v. Cook (2000), 9 R.F.L. (5th) 
  352; Sarafinchin v. Sarafinchin (2000), 189 D.L.R. (4th) 741; Manis v. Manis, 
  [2000] O.J. No. 4539; and Brans v. Brans (2000), 13 R.F.L. (5th) 335.</p>
<p>
  [33] The leading case is Orser v. Grant in which Benotto J. analyzed the issue 
  in this fashion, at paras. 10-13: </p>
<p class="indent"> Gross-Up for Tax</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Grant has arranged his financial affairs so that he paid 
  only $7,362.31 in income tax, substantially less than he would pay were he a 
  salaried employee. It means that he enjoys a net income after tax of $55,405.67.</p>
<p class="indent">The Child Support Guidelines base support on the payor's gross 
  taxable income. One of the objectives of the guidelines is to ensure &quot;consistent 
  treatment&quot; of those who are in &quot;similar circumstances&quot;. Thus, 
  there are provisions to impute income where a parent is exempt from paying tax, 
  lives in a lower taxed jurisdiction, or derives income from sources that are 
  taxed at a lower rate.</p>
<p class="indent">Where, as here, a parent arranges his or her affairs to pay 
  substantially less tax on income, the income must be grossed up before the table 
  is applied. This is the only way to ensure the consistency mandated by the legislation.</p>
<p class="indent">Here, I have been asked to use a 36% average tax rate. This 
  is reasonable. If I apply that gross-up to his net after tax income, his gross 
  income would be over $85,000. Thus, Mr. Grant would have to earn this gross 
  amount to net $55,405 for himself. This greater amount is what the table amount 
  of support should be based on. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [34] Benotto J.'s analysis was explicitly adopted by Speigel J. in Moran v. 
  Cook, Sachs J. in Sarafinchin v. Sarafinchin, Lane J. in Manis v. Manis and 
  Greer J. in Brans v. Brans. It was also followed by Rooke J. in Lavoie v. Wills 
  (2000), 13 R.F.L. (5th) 93 (Alta. Q.B.).</p>
<p> [35] Subject to observing that s. 19 of the Guidelines defines certain specific 
  circumstances<a name="r1"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> in which income may be imputed 
  and sets out the criteria to be met in those circumstances , I agree with the 
  general approach adopted in these cases. Section 1(d) of the Guidelines states 
  that one of the objectives of the Guidelines is &quot;to ensure consistent treatment 
  of spouses and children who are in similar circumstances&quot;. An interpretation 
  of sections 18 and 19 of the Guidelines that would impute the same income for 
  child support purposes to two parents, one earning a salary of $128,000 and 
  paying tax of $48,000 and the other receiving business income of $128,000 and 
  paying tax of $5000, would be remarkably out of step with the &quot;consistent 
  treatment&quot; objective of the Guidelines.</p>
<p>
  [36] Fortunately, such an interpretation is not required. The wording of s. 
  19 of the Guidelines is open-ended (&quot;which circumstances include&quot;), 
  thus indicating that the categories listed in that section are merely examples 
  of situations in which income may be imputed. There are, therefore, other potential 
  scenarios in which income can, and should, be imputed. Where significant amounts 
  of untaxed business income are used for payment of personal expenses, 'grossing 
  up' business income to place a spouse's real income on a par with what it would 
  be in a salary income context is, in my view, another such scenario. As Lane 
  J. expressed it, in a particularly practical fashion, in Manis v. Manis, at 
  para. 99: &quot;The fundamental principle is that the Court must estimate the 
  actual means which the parent has available for child support. If less tax is 
  paid, more is available.&quot; I would add only the reminder that the Guideline 
  table amounts are based on the gross income of salaried employees without regard 
  to potential differences in deductions. Accordingly, attempting to achieve absolute 
  consistency between salaried employees and the self-employed is neither necessary 
  nor appropriate.</p>
<p>
  [37] Finally, I wish to highlight the trial judge's findings that Riel failed 
  to make proper disclosure and that she did not accept his assertions that he 
  earns less now than he did in the past. These findings support the trial judge's 
  decision to gross up Riel's business income as part of determining his real 
  income. </p>
<p>
  (3) The security issue</p>
<p>
  [38] The trial judge refused to discharge the charging orders of $50,000 each 
  against Riel's cottage and home. She found that &quot;Mr. Riel has been in arrears 
  of support from the commencement of this application and throughout the entire 
  trial&quot;. She also commented adversely on Riel's non-disclosure of relevant 
  financial information and his failure to send proper cheques to the Family Responsibility 
  Office.</p>
<p> [39] I agree with the trial judge's analysis and conclusion on this issue. 
  The record before the trial judge established that &quot;[t]here is enough in 
  the husband's conduct, especially in relation to his failure to provide support 
  to the children, to raise the concern that some security should be provided&quot;:

  Cross-appeal issue</p>
<p>
  (4) The spousal support issue</p>
<p>
  [40] Holland Cross-appealed on the issue of spousal support, seeking an increase 
  from $150 to $3500 per month.</p>
<p>
  [41] The trial judge's conclusion on this issue was: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The evidence of Ms. Holland is that at the time of the settlement before Spiegel 
  J. in November 1998, she was prepared to accept $150 per month in spousal support 
  as she was satisfied with child support in the amount of $1732 per month. I 
  have determined that the child support should be increased to $2156.20 per month, 
  and I am not persuaded that Ms. Holland's position is significantly different 
  from what it was in November 1998. In addition, in light of section 15.3 of 
  the Divorce Act, and the priority to be given to child support, I make no change 
  to the existing spousal support order.</p>
<p>
  [42] I see no basis for disagreeing with this analysis and conclusion.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [43] I would dismiss the appeal and the Cross-appeal. In accordance with the 
  joint submission of counsel relating to this potential disposition, I would 
  award the respondent costs fixed at $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and 
  GST.</p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> For example, s. 19(1)(g) permits the 
  court to impute income where &quot;the parent or spouse unreasonably deducts 
  expenses from income&quot; [emphasis added] while s. 19(1)(h) requires that 
  a parent or spouse derive &quot;a significant portion of income&quot; [emphasis 
  added] from sources that are taxed at a lower rate than employment or business 
  income&quot; as a pre-condition to imputing income.</p>
<p><a name="r2"></a><a href="#2">[2]</a> I note that Holland brought a motion 
  seeking dismissal of Riel's appeal because he was substantially in arrears of 
  his child and spousal support obligations. The motion was withdrawn when Riel 
  deposited $39,200 with the Family Responsibility Office virtually on the eve 
  of the appeal hearing.</p>
