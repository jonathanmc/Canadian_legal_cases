<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals his conviction for sexual interference contrary to 
  s. 151 of the Criminal Code and raises two grounds of appeal.</p>
<p>1. Did the trial judge fail to resolve critical inconsistencies in the complainant's 
  evidence? </p>
<p>[2] The trial judge was alive to the inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence 
  and noted them. He also instructed himself that he had to scrutinize her evidence 
  very carefully. He did so and we are satisfied that he resolved the inconsistencies 
  in her evidence applying a common sense approach having regard to her age, the 
  submissions that were made to him, and the fact she was unshaken about the essential 
  elements of the offence and how it occurred. </p>
<p>2. Did the trial judge err in the manner he dealt with the prior consistent 
  statements and conduct of the complainant?</p>
<p>[3] Having regard to the trial judge's reasons as a whole we are satisfied 
  he did not misuse the evidence that the complainant disclosed the allegations 
  to three friends or the evidence of the complainant's demeanor when she made 
  this disclosure. Rather the trial judge used the evidence to accept the complainant's 
  explanation for not reporting the abuse earlier and in response to the defence 
  position that her failure to disclose to adults brought her credibility into 
  question. The trial judge also used the evidence to rebut the defence of motive 
  to fabricate. </p>
<p>[4] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
