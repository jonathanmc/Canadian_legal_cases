<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We do not think that the trial judge erred in his application of section 
  2(8) of the Family Law Act. There was evidence reasonably supporting his finding 
  of facts and we cannot say that he exercised his discretion wrongly.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] With respect to spousal support, while it may be that the trial judge's 
  award was somewhat generous, we are not persuaded that the award reflects any 
  misapprehension of the evidence or error in principle.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] With respect to the equalization payment, having regard to the length of 
  the marriage, the fact that the wife made no contribution to the acquisition, 
  preservation, maintenance or improvement to the matrimonial home, it was open 
  to the trial judge to apply section 5(6) of the Family Law Act and include in 
  the husband's net family property the growth in value of the matrimonial home 
  during the marriage. Further, on the evidence, it was open to the trial judge 
  to conclude that the increase in value was $11,100.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] With respect to the Algoma Steel shares, given the nature of the shares, 
  the manner of their acquisition, and the restrictions on their disposition, 
  it was open to the trial judge to order disposition in specie.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Accordingly, the appeal and the cross-appeal are both dismissed. [Costs 
  submissions.] There will be no order respecting costs.</p>
