<p>On appeal from the order of Justice J. R. Henderson of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated October 4, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ADDENDUM ON COSTS<br>
</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] On December 16, 2002, the court dismissed the appeal in this matter. In 
  its decision, the court granted leave to the parties to make written submissions 
  respecting costs of the appeal and the proceedings in first instance. </p>
<p>[2] Having received those submissions and considered them, we are of the opinion 
  that the parties should bear their own costs of the appeal and of the application. 
  The appeal raised the novel issue of whether the Superior Court should exercise 
  its general supervisory jurisdiction when the timelines contemplated by the 
  Child and Family Services Act R.S.O. 1990, c. C11 (the Act) respecting protection 
  applications for children who had been apprehended were grossly exceeded. </p>
<p>[3] The application judge acknowledged that the issues before him, &#147;were 
  unusual and perhaps unique&#148;. He declined to make an order that there be 
  no costs on the basis that the applicants sought an order that would have benefited 
  them and that in bringing the application they had to be aware of the risk that 
  costs would be ordered against them. </p>
<p>[4] We do not agree that the facts demonstrate that the foster parents were 
  motivated only by their own self-interest as opposed to acting in what they 
  perceived to be the best interests of the children. Budgell J. of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice had ordered that it was in the children&#146;s best interests 
  to remain in their present foster setting but that reasonable access be afforded 
  to the family members pending the outcome of the child protection proceedings. 
  The CAS&#146;s interpretation of &#147;reasonable access&#148; was that it had 
  the right to place the children on extended visits with the family members with 
  the result that the children would be residing with the appellants only a few 
  days in between these visits. The foster parents were concerned that this in 
  effect undermined the court&#146;s order and ignored the possible effect on 
  the children of such a disruption in the continuity of their care. This concern 
  was a major factor driving the proceedings before Henderson J. The fact that, 
  in the unusual circumstances of this case, they ultimately chose the wrong forum 
  in which to bring their concerns forward for adjudication should not result 
  in an award of costs against them. It is not the norm for costs to be awarded 
  in child protection cases where an applicant is unsuccessful. See e.g. Catholic 
  Children&#146;s Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) v. C.M., 
  [1994] 2 S.C.R. 165 and, by analogy, Rule 24 of the Family Law Rules which provides 
  that the presumption that a successful party is entitled to costs does not apply 
  in a child protection case. </p>
<p>[5] Accordingly, leave to appeal the costs order of Henderson J. is granted, 
  the costs order is set aside, and in its place an order will go that each party 
  bear his or her own costs of the application. We further order that there be 
  no costs of this appeal. </p>
