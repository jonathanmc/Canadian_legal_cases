<p>On appeal from the stay of proceedings ordered by Justice Robert L. Maranger 
  of the Superior Court of Justice, dated November 13, 2002.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This is a Crown appeal from a stay of proceedings ordered on November 13, 
  2002 by Justice R. L. Maranger of the Superior Court of Justice sitting in Perth. 
  The trial judge stayed the charges of aggravated assault, careless handling 
  of a firearm, sexual assault, incest, unlawful confinement and uttering threats 
  against the respondent on the basis that a delay of five years and six weeks 
  (61&frac12; months) from the date of arrest to the trial date violated his right 
  to be tried within a reasonable time guaranteed by s. 11(b) of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  [2] The 61&frac12; month period can usefully be divided into three blocks of 
  time: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) September 26, 1997 to May 16, 2000 (31&frac12; months) 
  - arrest to commencement of preliminary inquiry;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) May 16, 2000 to September 11, 2001 (16 months) - commencement 
  of preliminary inquiry to committal; and</p>
<p class="indent">(3) September 11, 2001 to November 13, 2002 (14 months) - committal 
  to stay (in superior court).</p>
<p>
  [3] The Crown contends that the trial judge erred in three respects in granting 
  a stay: (1) attributing the delay from the commencement to the completion of 
  the preliminary inquiry entirely to the lack of institutional resources; (2) 
  finding that the period of systemic delay in the case was &quot;clearly unacceptable&quot;, 
  and (3) failing to sufficiently consider the conduct of the respondent throughout 
  the proceedings in his assessment of whether the respondent was prejudiced by 
  the delay.</p>
<p>
  [4] I disagree. Our starting point is the observation that criminal cases should 
  not take 61&frac12; months to reach trial. As the pages of the calendar turn 
  from months to years, there is a duty on all participants in the case - Crown 
  counsel, defence counsel and the presiding judge - to formally recognize that 
  the case has become a real problem and is in jeopardy of not being heard on 
  the merits because of a violation of s. 11(b) of the Charter, as interpreted 
  in the leading judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada: see R. v. Askov (1990), 
  59 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Morin (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [5] In this case, there was simply not appropriate recognition by any of the 
  participants that it was a case in jeopardy. Between September 26, 1997 and 
  October 4, 1999, the case did not advance because of a series of mishaps which 
  were no one's fault, including the death of the respondent's counsel and the 
  respondent's illness. In spite of this 24 month delay, on October 4, 1999 the 
  preliminary inquiry was set, without much discussion, for May 16-18, 2000. On 
  May 18, 2000, with the calendar at 31 months, when the preliminary inquiry was 
  not completed it was adjourned to December 1, 2000. There was not a word from 
  anyone about whether this proposed continuation date was appropriate in light 
  of s. 11(b) of the Charter. On December 1, 2000, with the calendar at 38&frac12; 
  months, the case was adjourned to December 11, not to be continued, but rather 
  to set a new date for its continuation. Again, the presiding judge and both 
  counsel did not say anything that evinced a recognition that this criminal matter 
  had been proceeding for more than three years, but was still mired in only the 
  preliminary inquiry component of the trial. On December 11, 2000, the preliminary 
  inquiry was given a resumption date seven months away, on September 11, 2001, 
  solely because of the conflicting schedules of counsel. On September 11, 2001,with 
  the calendar at 48 months, the preliminary inquiry was completed and the respondent 
  was committed for trial.</p>

<p>[6] This chronology is, as the trial judge said, &quot;clearly unacceptable&quot;. 
  He said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [W]hat became a serious problem &#133; was once the inquiry started. The inquiry 
  finally got started in May of 2000 and took a full 16 months to complete, being 
  May 2000 to September 11th , 2001. That time frame has to be measured in the 
  context of the history of the proceedings. Here, the case in May 2000 had already 
  been in the system for two and a half years. It should have been fast tracked 
  but instead it got swallowed up and didn't speed up much more once in the system.	
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [7] I agree with this analysis. In R. v. Satkunananthan (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 
  321 at 343, this court said that &quot;[a] seven-month delay in scheduling the 
  continuation of a preliminary hearing is too long.&quot; In the present case, 
  the preliminary inquiry was adjourned for seven months on one occasion and then 
  for nine months on a second occasion.</p>
<p>
  [8] I do not say that long delays in the progress of a preliminary inquiry are 
  always avoidable or indicative of systemic delay. The complexities of certain 
  criminal trials, institutional resources, underestimates by counsel of the time 
  required to complete the preliminary inquiry, and the position of the parties, 
  especially any express waiver of time periods by the accused, might justify 
  some delays.</p>
<p> [9] However, what I do say is that it is incumbent on the presiding judge 
  and both counsel to explicitly recognize a case that is in trouble and to discuss 
  fully on the record how to deal with the problem.<a href="#r1">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
  If an adjournment of a preliminary inquiry is required, there should not be 
  a pro forma &quot;what is the next available date&quot; conversation. Instead, 
  the time period that has already elapsed should be explicitly acknowledged on 
  the record and there should be a frank discussion about how to solve the problem. 
  The focus of the discussion should be on ways to speed up the proceeding. The 
  presiding judge, the trial co-ordinator if necessary, and both counsel should 
  attempt quite consciously to schedule the continuation of the preliminary inquiry 
  - not several months down the road, but at the earliest possible date, taking 
  into account the commitments of the presiding judge and counsel. Then, once 
  a continuation date is set, counsel should explicitly state on the record their 
  position with respect to the implications of the further delay in a Charter 
  s. 11(b) context.</p>
<p>
  [10] None of this happened in this case. The trial judge was right to identify 
  the fundamental problem that led to an unacceptable 61&frac12; month delay, 
  namely, the preliminary inquiry &quot;got swallowed up&quot; in the system without 
  anyone raising the problem on the record or moving to solve it in an appropriate 
  fashion.</p>
<p>
  [11] I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
