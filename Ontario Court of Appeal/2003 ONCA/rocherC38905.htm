<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John D. Ground of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 19, 2002.</p>
<P>
  FELDMAN J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The respondent trustee in bankruptcy initially failed to realize on the 
  bankrupts' interests in two condominium units because the bankrupts' Statements 
  of Affairs misrepresented the value of the condominiums and the value of the 
  encumbrances on the properties. Following his discharge, the trustee learned 
  the true facts regarding the value of the condominiums and now seeks to realize 
  on the bankrupts' interests in the two properties for the benefit of the creditors. 
  The appellant, Rocher, is a creditor with a claim in the bankruptcy, and is 
  also a tenant in common of the two properties with the bankrupts. He opposes 
  the action of the trustee because he claims that he is now entitled to full 
  ownership of the two properties. The application judge ruled in favour of the 
  trustee in bankruptcy. I agree with the conclusion of the application judge 
  and, for the reasons that follow, would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>FACTS</P>  <P>
  [2] The bankrupts, Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson, along with the appellant (who was 
  their accountant) invested in two condominium units on Marbrook Lane in Toronto. 
  On December 28, 1990, they took title as tenants in common, with each owning 
  an undivided one-third interest. The units were purchased from the developer, 
  Cascades Partnership, which took back a mortgage as part of the financing of 
  the purchases. </P>  <P>
  [3] This developer and these units were included in a series of lawsuits in 
  the early 1990's involving the Mastercraft group of companies. In those lawsuits, 
  the condominium unit investors claimed that various misrepresentations and breaches 
  of the Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990 c. S.5 by the developers who sold them the 
  units, allowed them either to rescind the purchases or to obtain judgments for 
  damages against the developers in an amount equal to or greater than the mortgage 
  debts. The investors were successful against the developers. (The investors 
  were not successful against financial institutions in cases where the mortgage 
  debt had been assigned by the developer to a financial institution.) </P>  <P>
  [4] The mortgages on the Ferguson/Rocher units were never assigned by Cascades 
  to a financial institution. Consequently, although no one was able to produce 
  the relevant judgments, the application judge concluded from the record that, 
  as a result of the litigation, Cascades owed the investors damages in an amount 
  equal to or greater than the mortgage debts. Cascades never paid those damages, 
  nor were the mortgages discharged. As a result, although the mortgages continued 
  to appear as encumbrances against the properties, effectively, neither the Fergusons 
  nor Mr. Rocher owed Cascades anything in respect of those mortgages.</P>  <P>
  [5] Unfortunately, the record before the court regarding the litigation and 
  its effect is very unsatisfactory. The application judge asked the parties, 
  through their counsel, to provide him with copies of the judgments in the Cascades 
  litigation that affected the Ferguson/Rocher properties, but counsel were unable 
  to do so. However, in his cross-examination, Mr. Rocher confirmed his understanding 
  of what had occurred in that litigation. In further confirmation that effectively 
  nothing was owed on the mortgages, when Mr. Rocher asked Cascades for discharges 
  of the mortgages in 2001, the discharges were provided by Cascades' counsel 
  on the basis that nothing was owed on them.</P>  <P>
  [6] On January 22, 1997, the Fergusons made voluntary assignments in bankruptcy 
  and the respondent was appointed as trustee in bankruptcy of their estates. 
  They swore Statements of Affairs which listed the two condominium units at a 
  value of $80,000 each (presumably for their 2/3 interest). They also listed 
  secured debt of $80,000 in favour of the Hong Kong Bank on each of the two condominium 
  units as well as unsecured debt of $17,000 on each property to the same institution. 
  No security was shown in favour of Cascades, although its mortgages were not 
  discharged until 2001. In fact, there were no mortgages in favour of Hong Kong 
  Bank.</P>  <P>
  [7] The trustee in bankruptcy did not investigate to confirm the status of the 
  mortgages. Mr. Rocher was also a creditor of the bankrupts who proved in the 
  bankruptcy. As a one-third owner of the properties, he had full knowledge of 
  the status of the mortgages. At no time did he inform the trustee of the true 
  state of affairs in respect of the two properties or of the mortgages. </P>  <P>
  [8] The Fergusons were automatically discharged from bankruptcy on October 22, 
  1997, and the trustee was discharged on January 7, 1999. In response to a request 
  from Mr. Rocher, the respondent provided him with a letter dated April 5, 2001, 
  addressed &quot;to whom it may concern&quot;, stating that the trustee had no 
  interest in the condominium units. Relying on that letter, on the trustee's 
  discharge and on the statement in the trustee's final accounts that &quot;condos-retourner 
  au creancier&quot; (condos returned to creditor), Mr. Rocher arranged to obtain 
  discharges of the mortgages from Cascades on payment of some administration 
  fees. Mr. Rocher operated the properties both during and after the Fergusons' 
  bankruptcy, collecting rents and making all applicable payments. </P>  <P>
  [9] Following their discharge from bankruptcy, Mr. Rocher asked the Fergusons 
  to transfer their interests in the condominium properties to him. Although there 
  is a dispute on the record as to whether they agreed to make those transfers, 
  it is common ground that as a result of Mr. Rocher's request, Mrs. Ferguson 
  contacted the trustee, who then learned about the discharges of the mortgages 
  and that the condominiums were realizable assets for the benefit of the bankrupt 
  estate. The trustee then moved under s. 41(11) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
  Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 for an order reappointing the trustee, and amended 
  the registers to show the trustee as owner of a two-thirds interest in the properties.</P>  <P>
  [10] In response to these actions by the trustee, Mr. Rocher applied for an 
  order declaring that the trustee had no interest in the properties and for an 
  order under s. 40(1) or (2) of the BIA, returning the properties to the bankrupts. 
  The trustee brought a counter-application for partition and sale of the properties 
  and for a reference to take accounts as between the tenants in common. The application 
  judge granted the counter-application and ordered partition and sale.</p>
<p>GROUNDS OF APPEAL</P>  <P>
  [11] The appellant raises three main grounds of appeal: </P>  
<P class="indent"> (1) The trial judge had no basis on which to make his finding 
  of fact that the Cascades mortgages were not valid encumbrances on the properties 
  during the currency of the bankruptcies. Therefore the value of the properties 
  increased only when the mortgages were discharged after the discharge of the 
  bankrupts from bankruptcy. Consequently the increase in value coming post-bankruptcy, 
  does not form part of the bankrupt estate. </p>
<P class="indent">(2) The trustee having been negligent in his investigations 
  and having disclaimed any interest in the properties, cannot now go back and 
  claim them when Mr. Rocher has taken financial steps based on the trustee's 
  disclaimer.</p>
<P class="indent">(3) The appellant is entitled to apply under s. 40(1) of the 
  BIA for an order transferring the properties to him and therefore has status 
  on this application.</p>
<P>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>(1) Is the trustee entitled to reopen the bankruptcy to realize on unrealized 
  value in properties of the bankrupt? Does it matter if the value arose before 
  or after the discharge of the bankrupts from bankruptcy?</P>  <P>
  [12] As noted, the record on this application and appeal with respect to the 
  investor litigation regarding these properties is most unsatisfactory. Neither 
  counsel was able to provide the court with copies of any court orders or other 
  documentation respecting that litigation, as it affects the subject properties. 
  The application judge, who was also the judge with primary carriage of the Mastercraft/Cascades 
  litigation, stated that the result of the investor litigation against Cascades 
  directly was either that the mortgages were declared null and void or the condominium 
  purchasers were awarded damages greater than the mortgage debts. In his concluding 
  reasons, the application judge stated that the bankrupts knew that the mortgages 
  had been declared invalid as a result of the litigation against Cascades. </P>  <P>
  [13] The cross-examination of Mr. Rocher suggests that he believed that although 
  the investors had been successful in the litigation against Mastercraft (Cascades), 
  they could not collect from Mastercraft because it had no money. He had decided 
  to wait ten years from the time when Cascades first sent him a demand letter 
  with respect to the arrears on the mortgages before seeking a discharge. Had 
  Cascades sought to enforce the mortgages, he would have resisted. His cross-examination 
  also suggests that he believed there was a judgment which offset what was owed 
  on the mortgages and which would provide a defence to an action on the mortgages. 
  An April 23, 2001 letter from counsel for Cascades to Mr. Rocher's former counsel 
  states that &quot;the two mortgages no longer appear to be outstanding&quot; 
  and offers to execute discharges. No payment of any principal or interest was 
  requested.</P>  <P>
  [14] Although the record seems more consistent with the conclusion that the 
  mortgages were unenforceable because there was an offsetting judgment against 
  Cascades, rather than that the mortgages had been declared null and void, for 
  the purposes of this matter it makes no difference. The important finding is 
  that during the currency of the bankruptcies, the mortgages did not diminish 
  the value of the bankrupts' interests in the properties. There is no basis on 
  the record to overturn the finding made by the application judge.</P>  <P>
  [15] In Zemlak v. Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells Limited (1987), 66 C.B.R. 1 (Sask. 
  C.A.), the trustee in bankruptcy was precluded from asserting a right to property 
  which had increased in value following the discharges of the debtor and the 
  trustee. That is not the situation in this case. I agree with the application 
  judge that the trustee was entitled to seek reappointment in order to complete 
  his duties by realizing on the value of property which existed in the bankrupt 
  estates during the currency of the bankruptcies, but had not been disclosed 
  to him: Carriere v. P.J. Kelleher Ltd. (1994), 26 C.B.R. (3d) 297 (Man. C.A.).</p>
<p>(2) Is the trustee effectively estopped from reclaiming the property?</P>  <P>
  [16] The appellant's position is that during the bankruptcy, the respondent 
  trustee took no steps to verify the status of the mortgages. The trustee was 
  discharged and turned the properties back to what he thought was the secured 
  creditor, the Hong Kong Bank, then specifically disclaimed any interest in the 
  properties in the April 5, 2001 &quot;to whom it may concern&quot; letter. The 
  appellant says that in reliance on the words and acts of the trustee, he took 
  steps to take over the entire properties and is now entitled to keep them. Consequently, 
  the trustee is not entitled to reinstate himself as trustee and retake the properties. 
  I agree with the application judge that there is no merit in this position. 
  </P>  <P>
  [17] The application judge noted that because this was a summary administration 
  bankruptcy, the trustee did little to investigate the affairs of the bankrupts 
  and took their information at face value. That information turned out to be 
  inaccurate and misleading. The application judge concluded that the bankrupts 
  knew this to be the case. Whether or not they knew (they were not parties to 
  this litigation), the trustee relied on their Statements of Affairs and was 
  thereby misled as to both the value of the condominiums and as to the identity 
  of the secured creditor. He acted to the detriment of the estate as a result, 
  by not seeking to realize on the properties. </P>  <P>
  [18] The application judge also noted that Mr. Rocher had been acting as the 
  owner of both properties from the time of the bankruptcies so that he in fact 
  had not relied on the actions of the trustee in assuming that role. On the other 
  hand, he presumably would not have obtained the mortgage discharges and sought 
  a transfer of the bankrupts' interests had he not believed that the trustee 
  was making no claim to the properties. Be that as it may, any expenditures made 
  by Mr. Rocher can be compensated in the accounting procedure on the reference 
  in respect of the partition and sale proceedings. Furthermore, Mr. Rocher knew 
  the true facts regarding the value of the properties and did not advise the 
  trustee. The equities are not with him. They are with the trustee on behalf 
  of the creditors. </P>  <P>
  [19] I agree with the application judge that s. 41(11) of the BIA was properly 
  invoked in this case to allow the trustee to realize on the properties. The 
  section provides:</P>  
<P class="indent"> s. 41 (11) The court, on being satisfied that there are assets 
  that have not been realized or distributed, may, on the application of any interested 
  person, appoint a trustee to complete the administration of the estate of the 
  bankrupt, and the trustee shall be governed by the provisions of this Act, in 
  so far as they are applicable.</p>
<P class="indent">(3) Does the appellant have status on this application and is 
  he entitled to apply to have the properties transferred to him under s. 40(1) 
  of the BIA?</p>
<P>
  [20] Section 40(1) of the BIA provides:</P>  
<P class="indent"> s. 40 (1) With the permission of the inspectors, any property 
  of a bankrupt found incapable of realization shall be returned to the bankrupt 
  prior to the trustee's application for discharge.</P>  
<P>
  [21] The trustee submits that the properties, which vested in him upon bankruptcy 
  (s. 71(2)), but were not realized, did not revest in the bankrupts upon discharge: 
  R. v. Lifshen (1977), 25 C.B.R. (NS) 12 aff'd (1977), 25 C.B.R. (NS) 232 (Sask. 
  C.A.). Under s. 40(1), the properties had to be specifically returned to them, 
  and that was not done. </P>  <P>
  [22] The application judge held that only the bankrupt could apply for such 
  return and not a third party. There is authority to support that conclusion: 
  Petro Canada Inc. v. 490300 Ont. Inc. (1989), 74 C.B.R. 33 (Registrar Ferron). 
  However, the appellant relies on his status as a creditor of the bankrupts and 
  as manager of the properties to make him a &quot;person aggrieved&quot; within 
  the meaning of s. 37 of the BIA which provides:</P>  
<P class="indent"> 37. Where the bankrupt or any of the creditors or any other 
  person is aggrieved by any act or decision of the trustee, he may apply to the 
  court and the court may confirm, reverse or modify the act or decision complained 
  of an make such order in the premises as it thinks fit.</P>  
<P>
  [23] It is not necessary to decide the status issue and the interaction of ss. 
  37 and 40(1), as I have found that the appellant's application was properly 
  dismissed on the merits and that the actions of the trustee in taking steps 
  after his discharge to realize on the assets that formed part of the bankrupt 
  estate were properly taken. </P>  <P>
  [24] I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs to the trustee of $10,000.</p>
