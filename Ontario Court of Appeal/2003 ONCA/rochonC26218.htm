<p>On appeal from the convictions by Justice James B. Chadwick of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on December 22, 1995.</p>   <P>
  MACPHERSON J.A.:</p>   <P>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>   <P>
  [1] Jason Rochon and his mother Bonnie McAuley were convicted of the first degree 
  murder of William McAuley following a seven week trial presided over by Justice 
  James Chadwick. William McAuley was Bonnie's husband and Jason Rochon's step 
  father. A third co accused, Gerald Sheppard, was convicted of second degree 
  murder. Ms. McAuley and Mr. Rochon received the automatic sentences for first 
  degree murder - life imprisonment with parole ineligibility of 25 years.</p>   
<P> [2] Ms. McAuley and Mr. Rochon appeal their convictions.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  They do so largely on the basis of alleged defects in the trial judge's charge 
  to the jury. The issues raised by this component of the appeal include the trial 
  judge's treatment of domestic abuse in the McAuley home, the charge on self 
  defence, the charge on parties to the offence, the sufficiency of the trial 
  judge's caution about the testimony of some of the Crown witnesses, the instruction 
  about the use the jury could make of statements by Jason in the case against 
  his mother, and the charge on reasonable doubt.</p>
<P>
  [3] In addition, Jason Rochon appeals on the ground that the Crown's cross examination 
  of him was so abusive as to compromise the fairness of the trial.</p>   <P>
  B. FACTS</p>   <P>
  [4] William McAuley (&quot;William&quot;) was found dead on the floor of his 
  home in Ottawa on July 26, 1993. He had been stabbed with a knife and beaten 
  with a baseball bat. Jason Rochon (&quot;Rochon&quot;) and his friend Gerald 
  Sheppard (&quot;Sheppard&quot;) admitted that they had confronted and killed 
  William, but argued that they acted in self defence. Alternatively, Rochon contended 
  that he was acting in defence of his mother, or that he had been provoked by 
  William and should therefore be convicted only of manslaughter.</p>   <P>
  [5] The theory of the defence was that William was a heavy drinker who frequently 
  and brutally beat his wife, Bonnie McAuley (&quot;Bonnie&quot;), and on occasions 
  assaulted her three children, including Rochon. Some months earlier, William 
  had also threatened to kill Rochon if he ever set foot in the house again. On 
  the morning of July 26, 1993, Bonnie called Rochon and told him that William 
  hit her during an argument and that she planned to go to her parents' home with 
  her other children later that day. Rochon had grown sick of watching his mother 
  being brutalized and, fearing for her safety and that of the children, decided 
  to confront William and do whatever it took to prevent William from hurting 
  his family.</p>   <P>
  [6] Rochon initially intended to confront William outside a bar where William 
  was drinking. In order to conceal their identities, he and Sheppard put on black 
  clothes and gloves. They also brought along two baseball bats and a knife for 
  protection. However, the parking lot outside the bar was too bright, so Rochon 
  and Sheppard went to the McAuley home to wait for him there. When William arrived 
  home, he lunged at Rochon. Sheppard struck William with a bat. Fearing that 
  William would kill him or, at some later time, his mother, Rochon also struck 
  him with a bat. He testified that William fell, and he continued to strike him 
  in a blind rage. He did not recall using the knife, but remembered pulling it 
  out of William's chest.</p>   <P>
  [7] Following the homicide, Bonnie, Rochon and Sheppard, along with several 
  of the young men's friends, attempted to cover up Rochon's and Sheppard's participation 
  in the killing. The defence theory was that the Crown used the involvement of 
  these friends as leverage to induce them to give false testimony implicating 
  Bonnie and Rochon in a conspiracy to kill William in order to collect insurance 
  money. In particular, the defence contended that the testimony of Steven Loken 
  was especially suspect. He had been threatened with a first degree murder charge. 
  He eventually pleaded guilty to a charge of obstructing a police officer and 
  received a suspended sentence. He testified as a Crown witness. The defence 
  contended that his testimony changed significantly between his initial statement 
  to the police and his testimony at trial, and each time it changed it gave further 
  support to the Crown theory of the case.</p>   <P>
  [8] The Crown theory was that Bonnie and Rochon agreed that Rochon would kill 
  William and they would share the insurance money, including on a policy that 
  Bonnie had placed on William's life three days before William's death. Bonnie 
  and Rochon had often told people that they would like to kill William and collect 
  insurance money. Specifically, Rochon had repeatedly told people that his mother 
  wanted him to kill William, and that she would buy him a car and send him and 
  his friends on a vacation. Bonnie was experiencing serious financial difficulty 
  and needed the money. Nonetheless, she told a neighbour to hold on to a sports 
  car that was for sale &quot;until she could arrange financing&quot;. Rochon 
  and Bonnie both attempted to find a hitman to do the job but were not successful. 
  The ultimate plan was that Bonnie would go to the movies so that she would have 
  an alibi, and Rochon and Sheppard would do the killing, making it look like 
  a break in. Rochon and Sheppard arrived at the apartment, unscrewed the light 
  bulbs and hid in the dark. They attacked William the moment he walked in the 
  door.</p>   <P>
  [9] This brief and general summary of the facts, anchored in the essential features 
  of the case put forward by the Crown and the defence, needs to be supplemented 
  by reference to other facts. However, it is preferable to refer to these additional 
  facts in the context of the specific issues to which they relate.</p>   <P>
  C. ISSUES</p>   
<P> [10] The appellants advance six grounds of appeal, two relating to Rochon, 
  two relating to Bonnie, and two relating to them jointly.</p>
<P class="indent"> (1) Rochon issues</p>
<P class="indent"> (a) Did the trial judge err in his instruction to the jury 
  on self defence?</p>
<P class="indent"> (b) Was the Crown's cross examination of Rochon so abusive 
  that it compromised the fairness of the trial?</p>
<P class="indent"> (2) Bonnie issues</p>
<P class="indent"> (a) Did the trial judge err in his instruction to the jury 
  about how to assess Bonnie's potential liability as a party to the offence?</p>
<P class="indent"> (b) Did the trial judge err by failing to properly instruct 
  and caution the jury with respect to the use of statements made by Rochon as 
  evidence against Bonnie?</p>
<P class="indent"> (3) Joint issues</p>
<P class="indent"> (a) Did the trial judge provide a sufficient caution with respect 
  to the testimony of several Crown witnesses, especially Steven Loken?</p>
<P class="indent"> (b) Was the trial judge's instruction on reasonable doubt defective?</p>
<P>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>   <P>
  (1) Rochon issues</p>   <P>
  (a) Self defence</p>   <P>
  [11] The appellant makes several arguments about the trial judge's charge relating 
  to self defence. I would group these arguments into three categories - the trial 
  judge's treatment of the evidence relating to domestic abuse, his charge on 
  s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code, and whether he 'overcharged' by leaving too many 
  of the Code's self defence provisions with the jury.</p>   <P>
  (i) Domestic abuse</p>   <P>
  [12] Rochon submits that the trial judge erred in three specific ways in dealing 
  with the evidence concerning the violence perpetrated by the deceased in the 
  family home. First, he minimized the significance of this evidence by instructing 
  the jury that it was of limited relevance to the factual issues to be resolved 
  by them. Second, he failed to refer to important aspects of this evidence when 
  summarizing it for the jury. Third, he failed to identify the specific issues 
  to which this evidence related, and to instruct the jury adequately concerning 
  how they could use that evidence in determining those issues.</p>   <P>
  &quot;Limited relevance&quot; of domestic abuse</p>   <P>
  [13] The trial judge's comment that the evidence of domestic abuse was of limited 
  relevance appears early in the charge in the following context:</p>   
<P class="indent"> At the beginning of the review of the facts, let me first deal 
  with spousal abuse. There is conflicting evidence about the relationship between 
  Bonnie McAuley and Bill McAuley. After listening to all the evidence, I get 
  the feeling that we are dealing with a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Some people 
  see him in one light and some people see him in another light. I do not know 
  what the true story is. Spousal abuse is, of course, of grave concern to the 
  courts. We have been taking a very strong and responsible approach to spousal 
  abuse.</p>
<P class="indent">Having said that, it is of limited relevancy in this particular 
  case. If Bonnie McAuley was charged as the actual perpetrator, the one who had 
  committed the murder, it would be very relevant to her position. However, she 
  is not and I will explain in a short time how she is brought into this particular 
  charge. </p>
<P class="indent">The family situation of abuse may have a bearing upon Jason 
  Rochon and his state of mind. It may also have relevancy when you consider the 
  actions of Bonnie McAuley. It may help explain why she said or did certain things 
  prior to the death of William McAuley. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<P>
  [14] Read as a whole, rather than minimizing the evidence of domestic abuse, 
  this passage accurately set out its role in the trial and focused the jury's 
  attention on its relevance and permissible use. The evidence of domestic abuse 
  carried with it the potential for misuse by engendering feelings of hostility 
  against the deceased. Although the trial judge might have gone further and instructed 
  the jury that they must not conclude, based on this evidence, that the deceased 
  deserved punishment for his behaviour, the impugned instruction struck an appropriate 
  balance by directing the jury's attention to the permissible use of the evidence. 
  In particular, the linkage between the domestic abuse and Rochon's state of 
  mind appropriately presaged an issue that would be central to Rochon's defences 
  under ss. 34(2) and 37 of the Code.</p>   <P>
  Failure to refer to important evidence</p>   <P>
  [15] I agree with Rochon's submission that, in his summary of the evidence relating 
  to self-defence, the trial judge failed to mention evidence from a former neighbour 
  concerning an incident of extreme violence in 1982 in which William threatened 
  to kill not only Bonnie, but also Rochon, and that he also failed to mention 
  Rochon's step-sister's evidence confirming that the abuse persisted until at 
  least 1992. However, I do not agree with his submission that these were significant 
  omissions.</p>   <P>
  [16] Rochon contends that these omissions are important because, although the 
  Crown did not contest the relevance of domestic abuse to the issues at the trial, 
  it asserted that Bonnie overplayed the abuse and that, if there was abuse, it 
  was not at a level that would support a claim of self-defence.</p>   <P>
  [17] However, it is important to recall that the trial judge commented on the 
  conflicting evidence and said &quot;I get the feeling that we are dealing with 
  a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, conveying the impression that he thought the 
  evidence of domestic abuse was worthy of belief. Moreover, in reviewing the 
  evidence relevant to self-defence, the trial judge properly focused the jury's 
  attention on Rochon's understanding of what had occurred. For example, near 
  the beginning of his summary of the evidence relating to ss. 34(1) and (2), 
  the trial judge said:</p>   
<P class="indent"> On examination-in-chief, [Rochon] was asked about his state 
  of mind, and Rochon said that in June of 1993 the picture he has was that McAuley 
  came home drunk every night and that he was violent towards his mother and his 
  brother and sister.</p>
<P class="indent">He was convinced, according to his evidence, that his mother 
  would be killed. You will recall from his evidence that he spoke to Jeff Walker 
  at the Children's Aid Society and that he also spoke to Sherry Bennett who worked 
  at the Billings House. Obviously, he got no satisfaction from them&#133;.</p>
<P>
  [18] The trial judge alluded to the former neighbour's evidence and to Rochon's 
  step-sister's evidence elsewhere in the charge. In my view, the trial judge 
  adequately reviewed the evidence of domestic abuse relating to the critical 
  issue that the jury had to determine, namely, Rochon's state of mind.</p>   <P>
  Failure to relate evidence to specific issues</p>   <P>
  [19] Rochon's third submission on the basis of domestic abuse is that the trial 
  judge failed to identify the specific issues to which the evidence of domestic 
  abuse related and to instruct the jury adequately concerning how it could use 
  that evidence in determining those issues. In support of this submission, Rochon 
  relies on three distinct instances where he claims the trial judge erred.</p>   <P>
  [20] First, Rochon asserts that, when dealing with s. 34(2) of the Code, the 
  trial judge reviewed the evidence globally and failed to point out to the jury 
  that the evidence of domestic abuse was relevant to the specific issues of whether 
  Rochon was under a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm 
  at the time of the killing, and whether Rochon believed, on reasonable grounds, 
  that he could not otherwise preserve himself. In addition, the trial judge failed 
  to explain to the jury how they could use the evidence of domestic abuse in 
  determining those issues.</p>   <P>
  [21] I disagree. When the trial judge turned to the issue of self defence, he 
  reviewed the facts relevant to a s. 34(2) defence:</p>   
<P class="indent"> According to Rochon, there were at least three confrontations 
  between McAuley and Rochon during the period of time that Rochon lived with 
  the McAuleys. He described those confrontations in detail. You may recall they 
  were not brutal confrontations, but they were confrontations and there was perhaps 
  some shoving and some threats at that time.</p>
<P class="indent">When he left the home after this snow shovelling incident we 
  heard so much about, Rochon's evidence is that McAuley told him, &quot;If you 
  ever step foot in this house again, I will kill you.&quot; And Rochon in his 
  evidence in chief said he believed McAuley when McAuley said that.</p>
<P class="center"> . . . . .</p>   
<P class="indent"> On examination in chief, he was asked about his state of mind, 
  and Rochon said that in June of 1993 the picture he had was that McAuley came 
  home drunk every night and that he was violent towards his mother and his brother 
  and sister. [Emphasis added.]</p>   
<P>
  [22] In addition, in his recharge concerning s. 34(2), the trial judge referred 
  to the evidence relating to Rochon's background, including the history of violence, 
  again highlighting the potential relevance of this evidence to the specific 
  issue of Rochon's subjective fear:</p>   
<P class="indent"> Based upon his fear of McAuley, was Rochon in reasonable apprehension 
  of danger or death or grievous bodily harm and had he no other solution but 
  to kill his attacker, McAuley? So, it is the state of mind of Rochon that you 
  have to look at, taking into consideration all of the evidence that you have 
  heard about the family violence.</p>
<P class="indent">Rochon does not have to wait until the attack is in full progress 
  before he makes this assessment. In other words, you do not have to wait until 
  you are beaten to death before you make the assessment that you may be in fear 
  of your life. The background of Rochon and the history of family violence, and 
  his fear of McAuley, are all relevant in determining what Rochon believed about 
  the threats made by McAuley and Rochon's apprehension of fear and the need to 
  use deadly force to repel the attack by McAuley. [Emphasis added.] </p>
<P>
  [23] In my view, it is clear from these passages that the trial judge reviewed 
  the relevant evidence relating to domestic abuse and related it to the central 
  issues of self defence.</p>   <P>
  [24] Second, Rochon contends that, when dealing with s. 37 of the Code, the 
  trial judge failed to instruct the jury that the evidence of domestic abuse 
  was specifically relevant to whether Rochon used more force than was necessary 
  to prevent an assault on his mother or himself under s. 37 of the Code.</p>   <P>
  [25] I disagree. The trial judge outlined Rochon's position concerning the protection 
  of others, and framed the issue as whether Rochon was entitled to defend himself 
  and his mother from the threat of the deceased by using no more force than necessary 
  to prevent any assault or its repetition by the deceased. Referring to the evidence 
  on this issue, the trial judge said:</p>   
<P class="indent"> You should consider the following evidence and any other relevant 
  evidence when considering whether or not Rochon was acting in self defence within 
  the meaning of 37. Once again, consider the attack by McAuley, the grabbing 
  of the shirt and the verbal threats to Rochon and Bonnie McAuley. Did Rochon 
  use more force than necessary to repel this assault by McAuley?</p>
<P class="indent">Consider Rochon's state of mind which I have already referred 
  to, and his background. Consider the amount of force used by McAuley. The bat, 
  the knife, the fact of his size, the fact that Sheppard was there, the fact 
  that Sheppard also had a bat. Consider the extent of the injuries that I have 
  just read to you by Dr. Johnston. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<P>
  [26] Rochon's final submission under this heading is that the trial judge failed 
  to instruct the jury that they could use the evidence of domestic abuse in assessing 
  the likelihood that the deceased was the initial aggressor, and concerning the 
  plausibility of Rochon's evidence that he took the bats and the knife for protection 
  and that he intended only to confront the deceased.</p>   <P>
  [27] I disagree. Trial counsel did not request either of these instructions. 
  In any event, both considerations flowed naturally from the evidence. In particular, 
  Rochon explained at the trial that he took the bats and the knife for protection. 
  In these circumstances, I see no realistic possibility that the jury would not 
  have recognized these potential uses of the evidence. </p>   <P>
  (ii) Section 34(2)</p>   <P>
  [28] Rochon contends that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury on s. 
  34(2) in three ways: (1) the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that even 
  an accused who provokes an assault can rely on s. 34(2); (2) the trial judge 
  improperly stated that s. 34(2) is more stringent than s. 34(1); and (3) the 
  trial judge improperly narrowed his s. 34(2) defence by removing a scenario 
  in which he had a mistaken belief as to the existence of an assault by the deceased.</p>   <P>
  Section 34(2) where accused provoked assault</p>   <P>
  [29] I do not agree that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury 
  that s. 34(2) is available even when an accused provokes an assault. There is 
  a distinction between telling a jury that an accused who provokes an assault 
  cannot rely on s. 34(2) and not telling a jury that even an accused who provokes 
  an assault can rely on s. 34(2). As explained by Laskin J.A. in R. v. Jenkins 
  (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 440 at 452 (Ont. C.A.):</p>   
<P class="indent"> It is an error in law to expressly tell the jury that an accused 
  who provokes an assault cannot rely on s. 34(2). Whether it is an error in law 
  not to tell the jury that even an accused who does provoke an assault can rely 
  on s. 34(2) depends on the rest of the instructions on self defence. If the 
  instructions as a whole reasonably could have misled the jury into believing 
  that an accused who provokes an assault is deprived of the defence of self defence 
  under s. 34(2), then the non direction on provocation is an error of law.</p>   
<P>
  [30] In the present case, the trial judge carefully outlined the respective 
  components of ss. 34(1) and (2) of the Code. The requirement that Rochon not 
  have provoked the assault was addressed on s. 34(1), but not on s. 34(2). There 
  are only two sentences in the charge that created any possible suggestion that 
  s. 34(2) includes a similar requirement. First, after completing his review 
  of ss. 34(1) and (2), the trial judge said the following:</p>   
<P class="indent"> As we have no way of knowing whether you will find Jason Rochon 
  commenced or provoked the assault, then you must turn to the next section, which 
  is section 35. [Emphasis added.] </p>
<P> Second, when dealing with s. 35, the trial judge read the following 
  definition of provocation:</p>
<P class="indent"> Provocation includes, for the purposes of sections 34 and 35, 
  provocation by blows, words or gestures. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<P>
  [31] In my view, the manner in which the trial judge instructed the jury on 
  ss. 34(1) and (2) excludes any possibility that either of these sentences would 
  have misled the jury into concluding that an accused who provokes an assault 
  cannot rely on s. 34(2). The trial judge told the jury that &quot;s. 34(1) provides 
  a defence &#133; if you believe, or are left with a reasonable doubt that&quot; 
  and listed four requirements, including absence of provocation. Similarly, the 
  trial judge told the jury that &quot;34(2), it provides a defence &#133; if 
  you believe or are left with a reasonable doubt that&quot; and listed three 
  requirements. The trial judge made no reference to absence of provocation in 
  relation to s. 34(2). It would have been obvious to the jury from these instructions 
  that s. 34(2) was different from s. 34(1) and that a defence was available under 
  s. 34(2) so long as the listed requirements were satisfied.</p>   <P>
  [32] Moreover, it is not incumbent on a trial judge to charge on every variation 
  of a self defence provision. Read as a whole, the trial judge's charge on s. 
  34(2) placed Rochon's defence under this provision before the jury in a straightforward, 
  comprehensible and fair fashion. Rochon's defence under this provision was that 
  William assaulted him when he entered the house and that Rochon defended himself. 
  The trial judge presented this defence to the jury.</p>   <P>
  Section 34(2) as &quot;more stringent&quot; than s. 34(1)</p>   <P>
  [33] Rochon also contends that the trial judge erred by observing: &quot;You 
  can see by examining both of these subsections that 34(2) has more stringent 
  conditions for its application than 34(1).&quot; Rochon submits that since the 
  trial judge also told the jury (correctly, Rochon concedes) that he did not 
  think that s. 34(1) applied, the description of s. 34(2) as &quot;more stringent&quot; 
  might have left the jury with the impression that it was a particularly difficult 
  defence for an accused to establish.</p>   <P>
  [34] I disagree. In several important respects, the conditions of s. 34(2) are 
  quite different from those relating to s. 34(1). Section 34(2) applies only 
  to situations where a serious threat (&quot;reasonable apprehension of death 
  or grievous bodily harm&quot;) is joined with a proportionately serious response 
  (self defence causing &quot;death or grievous bodily harm&quot;). Section 34(1) 
  does not require the reasonable apprehension and belief that are necessary to 
  invoke s. 34(2).</p>   <P>
  [35] In any event, the trial judge gave a full and clear charge on s. 34(2). 
  It is evident from a reading of his charge as a whole that he regarded s. 34(2) 
  as central to Rochon's defence and instructed the jury accordingly.</p>   <P>
  Mistaken belief as to existence of assault</p>   <P>
  [36] In his charge to the jury, the trial judge stated that &quot;self defence 
  is only available to Rochon if the force used by him was in response to an unlawful 
  assault by McAuley.&quot; In fact, self defence is available where the accused 
  had a reasonable but mistaken belief that he was being assaulted: see R. v. 
  Malott, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 123 at 132. Rochon argues that this distinction is relevant 
  in light of the evidence of McAuley's prior assaults on Rochon and his history 
  as a &quot;fighter&quot; and abusive spouse, all of which make it more likely 
  that Rochon might have mistakenly believed he was being assaulted by McAuley.</p>   <P>
  [37] I do not agree that the question of whether Rochon reasonably but mistakenly 
  believed in the existence of an assault was a live issue in this trial. Rochon's 
  evidence was that McAuley attacked first, lunging at him and grabbing his shirt. 
  This is not a case, such as Malott, where it was unclear whether the alleged 
  conduct of the deceased - even accepting the accused's testimony - actually 
  amounted to an assault. In Malott, the &quot;unlawful assault&quot; consisted 
  of opening a car door and putting one foot on the ground, while the accused 
  stood outside the car. The history of abuse and the surrounding events in Malott 
  were critical in establishing that this otherwise unremarkable act could result 
  in a reasonable belief in an assault.</p>   <P>
  [38] In the present appeal, the issue was whether the nature of McAuley's assault, 
  as described by Rochon, justified the use of deadly force. On this issue, the 
  trial judge properly reviewed the evidence of McAuley's violent history, and 
  related it to Rochon's reasonable belief that he needed to use deadly force 
  to repel the attack.</p>   <P>
  (iii) Overcharge</p>   <P>
  [39] The trial judge instructed the jury with respect to ss. 27, 34(1), 34(2), 
  35 and 37 of the Code. Rochon contends that the inclusion of s. 34(1) amounted 
  to an overcharge which probably had the effect of confusing the jury. I disagree, 
  for two reasons.</p>   <P>
  [40] First, in pre charge discussions both Rochon's counsel (a very experienced 
  criminal counsel) and Crown counsel submitted that s. 34(1) should be left with 
  the jury. Rochon's counsel explained his position as follows:</p>   
<P class="indent"> THE COURT: Sections 34 and 35?</p>
<P class="indent"> MR. NEVILLE: Yes.</p>
<P class="indent"> THE COURT: Both parts of Section 34?</p>
<P class="indent">MR. NEVILLE: Yes. Now, obviously, given the, not just the head 
  injuries and the knife injuries, I don't think the jury would be troubled very 
  long with 34(1), because that has, as its underlying premise, no intention to 
  kill or cause bodily harm. Clearly that was inflicted. Given, however, Rochon's 
  evidence that he goes into a blackout or rage state, as he defined it, would 
  certainly be a relevant area of evidence as to whether he had any lethal intent 
  with a mind that was functioning as opposed to in a rage. That is why, I suppose, 
  34(1) is nominally a live issue because, was his mind actually functioning other 
  than in a rage when the fatal harm was inflicted?</p>
<P>
  [41] In R. v. Pintar (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.), which I note was 
  decided after the trial in the present case, Moldaver J.A. discussed the difficulties 
  of determining which Criminal Code provisions to place before a jury in a self 
  defence case. He discussed the particular problem relating to ss. 34(1) and 
  (2) and suggested an approach for resolving the problem at p. 417:</p>   
<P class="indent"> On a practical level, in those cases where s. 34(1) remains 
  theoretically available, it is often difficult, if not impossible, to imagine 
  a scenario wherein the jury would reject the wider justification afforded by 
  s. 34(2) and apply s. 34(1) to acquit. The question then becomes whether the 
  risk of confusing the jury and complicating the charge justifies the inclusion 
  of instruction on s. 34(1), when its application is at best tenuous and its 
  scope of justification narrower than that available under s. 34(2).</p>
<P class="indent">For my part, I am of the view that when trial judges are faced 
  with situations like this, they should call upon counsel to justify instruction 
  on the narrower provision. If the results of that exercise reveal either the 
  lack of an evidentiary base for putting the narrower provision, or an inability 
  to demonstrate how the narrower provision might be available to fill a gap not 
  provided for by the broader one, the narrower provision should be discarded. 
  Once again, let me be clear that the underlying purpose of this exercise is 
  not to remove self defence from the jury's consideration. Rather it is designed 
  to focus the jury's attention on the essence of the claim to self defence and 
  the available Code provision(s) most relevant to it.</p>
<P>
  [42] In my view, the trial judge did precisely what Moldaver J.A. suggested 
  in this passage. He raised the issue with counsel, listened to their justification 
  concerning s. 34(1), and decided to leave it with the jury.</p>   <P>
  [43] Second, the trial judge made it clear that the jury should focus on s. 
  34(2), not s. 34(1). He said:</p>   
<P class="indent"> With reference to 34(1), I would suggest the conduct of the 
  accused Rochon does not fit within this provision. This section does not apply 
  if you find that the force Rochon used was intended to cause death. On the facts 
  before you, I would think you would have very little difficulty reaching that 
  conclusion. However, this is something that you must decide, as jurors. It is 
  not for me to decide.</p>   
<P>
  In my view, this instruction struck an appropriate balance between the trial 
  judge's recognition that s. 34(1) was, barely, a live issue and Rochon's counsel's 
  request, in which the Crown joined, that it be left with the jury.</p>   <P>
  (b) Abusive cross examination</p>   <P>
  [44] Rochon submits that Crown counsel's cross examination of him was abusive 
  and improper to a degree that the fairness of the trial was compromised. Rochon 
  divides this submission into two components: first, a contention that the Crown 
  cross examined on irrelevant and prejudicial matters and in a condescending 
  and sarcastic manner; and second, a contention that the Crown improperly pitted 
  Rochon's evidence against that of the Crown witnesses by inviting Rochon to 
  comment on whether the Crown witnesses were lying.</p>   <P>
  [45] The Crown's cross examination of Rochon took place over two days. It covers 
  230 pages of transcript and involved several thousand questions and answers. 
  It was not a perfect cross examination, especially in its early minutes.</p>   <P>
  [46] Almost at the start of the cross examination, this exchange took place:</p>   
<P class="indent"> Q. Now, seeing as you've admitted that you killed William McAuley, 
  why aren't you pleading guilty?</p>
<P class="indent">MR. NEVILLE: That's not a proper question, your Honour, with 
  great respect. This is a trial. It's a matter for the jury. </p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: Mr. Berzins, there's more than one charge included 
  in the offence.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. BERZINS:</p>
<P class="indent">Q. Are you guilty of first degree murder?</p>
<P class="indent">A. You don't believe so, sir.</p>
<P class="indent">Q. Are you guilty of second degree murder?</p>
<P class="indent">A. I don't believe so, sir.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. NEVILLE: This is just doing it in a more detailed way. Your 
  Honour just told him to move on. It's not for Mr. Rochon to express his opinion 
  of what level of guilt, if any, he has. It's for the court.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: Move on to something else.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. BERZINS:</p>
<P class="indent">Q. Well, I submit to you that this story that you have made 
  up for the members of the jury is in order to get off on manslaughter, isn't 
  that correct?</p>
<P class="indent">A. It's the truth, sir.</p>
<P class="indent">Q. Isn't that your real reason, you want to go down only for 
  manslaughter?</p>
<P class="indent">MR. NEVILLE: I'm going to object again. These are improper questions, 
  they are legal questions.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: Mr. Neville, I have heard your objection.</p>
<P class="indent">MR. BERZINS:</p>
<P class="indent">Q. And your evidence is that Mr. McAuley attacked you; right?</p>
<P class="indent">A. Yes, he did, sir.</p>
<P class="indent"><span class="indent">Q. And you were in fact acting in self 
  defence?</span></p>
<P class="indent"> A. I didn't act, sir. Actually when he grabbed me Jay had struck 
  him and then I acted after.</p>
<P class="indent"> Q. But you were acting in self defence essentially after that 
  because he was going to attack you?</p>
<P class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<P class="indent"> Q. All right. So maybe you're not guilty of anything at all, 
  if you were acting in self defence.</p>
<P class="indent"> MR. NEVILLE: Maybe not, maybe he's not.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: Mr. Neville, please.</p>
<P class="indent">THE WITNESS: That's for the jury to decide, sir.</p>
<P>
  [47] Crown counsel's questions in this exchange were improper, defence counsel 
  properly objected, and the trial judge upheld the objections on the first two 
  occasions. Crown counsel briefly continued with this line of questioning, defence 
  counsel continued to object, and the trial judge noted, but did not uphold, 
  the objection. Crown counsel then moved on to other areas. Although the questions 
  should not have been asked and although it would have been preferable for the 
  trial judge to move the Crown off this topic in a firmer fashion, in the context 
  of a two day cross examination, I do not regard this brief exchange as sufficiently 
  serious to constitute an abuse.</p>   <P>
  [48] Rochon also contends that Crown counsel improperly placed him in the position 
  of calling several Crown witnesses liars. By way of example, Crown counsel referred 
  to the testimony of Rebecca Sturdevant and asked Rochon: &quot;Do you know of 
  any reasons why she would have to lie?&quot; Defence counsel properly objected 
  and, on appeal, counsel for the Crown conceded that this type of question was 
  improper: see R. v. R. (A.J.) (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 168 at 178 (Ont. C.A.).</p>   <P>
  [49] Again, I do not think that this transgression rises to the level of 'abusive' 
  in the context of the cross examination as a whole. A useful discussion of the 
  limits of cross examination is contained in R. (A.J.), wherein Doherty J.A. 
  said at p. 176:</p>   
<P class="indent"> Crown counsel is entitled, indeed, in some cases expected, 
  to conduct a vigorous cross examination of an accused. Effective cross examination 
  of an accused serves the truth finding function as much as does effective cross 
  examination of a complainant.</p>
<P class="indent">There are, however, well established limits on cross examination. 
  Some apply to all witnesses, others only to the accused. Isolated transgressions 
  of those limits may be of little consequence on appeal. Repeated improprieties 
  during the cross examination of an accused are, however, a very different matter. 
  As the improprieties mount, the cross examination may cross over the line from 
  the aggressive to the abusive. When that line is crossed, the danger of a miscarriage 
  of justice is very real. If improper cross examination of an accused prejudices 
  that accused in his defence or is so improper as to bring the administration 
  of justice into disrepute, an appellate court must intervene: R. v. Fanjoy (1985), 
  21 C.C.C.(3d) 312, 21 D.L.R. (4th) 321, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 233; R. v. Ruptash (1982), 
  68 C.C.C. (2d) 182 at p. 189, 36 A.R.346 (C.A.). </p>
<P>
  [50] I do not think that the Crown's cross examination of Rochon in the present 
  case crossed the line from aggressive to abusive. Although on several occasions 
  Crown counsel impermissibly framed questions in terms of lying or motives for 
  lying, for the most part he framed his questions in this domain in a proper 
  fashion - namely, he set out what the Crown witness had said and invited Rochon 
  to respond.</p>   <P>
  [51] Moreover, I think it essential to consider the cross examination in its 
  entirety. On my reading, it was a regular and ordinary cross examination, both 
  in tone and in substance. Indeed, in the entire 230 page transcript, the only 
  objections made by Rochon's counsel were in the two areas I have set out. As 
  well, there was no objection or motion made at the conclusion of the cross examination. 
  In short, the Crown's cross examination of Rochon was far removed from the egregious 
  cross examination of the accused described so vividly in R. (A.J.).</p>   <P>
  (2) Bonnie McAuley issues</p>   <P>
  (a) Party to the offence</p>   <P>
  [52] Bonnie advances two submissions with respect to the trial judge's charge 
  dealing with how the jury was to approach its assessment of her potential liability. 
  The submissions relate to, respectively, ss. 21(1)(c) and 22 of the Criminal 
  Code.</p>   <P>
  (i) Section 21(1)(c)</p>   <P>
  [53] Section 21(1)(c) defines party liability in terms of a person who &quot;abets&quot; 
  another person who commits the offence. Both in the charge and in the recharge, 
  the trial judge used the word &quot;support&quot; as part of the definition 
  of &quot;abet&quot;.</p>   <P>
  [54] Bonnie contends that this was an error in that it makes the definition 
  of &quot;abet&quot; too broad. In support of this submission, Bonnie relies 
  on R. v. Greyeyes, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 825 at 837 wherein Cory J. said &quot;[t]o 
  abet within the meaning of s. 21(1)(c) includes encouraging, instigating, promoting 
  or procuring the crime to be committed&quot;, and the French version of s. 21(1)(c) 
  which provides &quot;quiconque encourage quelqu'un &agrave; la commettre&quot;.</p>   <P>
  [55] For several reasons, I do not accept this submission.</p>   <P>
  [56] First, the trial judge did not use only the word &quot;support&quot; in 
  defining &quot;abet&quot;. Indeed, the principal word he used was &quot;encourage&quot;. 
  As I read his charge, his references to the definition of &quot;abet&quot; were: 
  &quot;whether . . . she provided guidance or encouragement to Rochon&quot;; 
  &quot;abetting means to encourage or to support&quot;; &quot;An abettor may 
  encourage or lend moral support to the principal offender&quot;; &quot;it would 
  make her a party to the offence, just the same as Rochon, if you find that she 
  provided guidance and counselling&quot;; &quot;was she counselling him&quot;; 
  &quot;if she intended to counsel or guide Rochon&quot;; and &quot;if she intended 
  . . . to encourage or support Rochon&quot;. When I examine the phraseology employed 
  by the trial judge, particularly in the context of his review of the evidence, 
  it seems clear that the jury would have understood that it could find Bonnie 
  liable as an abettor only if it was convinced that she played an active role 
  in encouraging Rochon to commit the offence.</p>   <P>
  [57] Second, I do not think that the word &quot;support&quot; is impermissible 
  in the context of a proper definition of &quot;abet&quot; in s. 21(1)(c). Indeed, 
  there are many cases in which appellate courts have approved a formulation employing 
  the linkage of &quot;encourage&quot; and &quot;support&quot;: see, for example, 
  R. v. E. (L.) (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 228 at 247 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Rhyno (1944), 
  83 C.C.C. 186 at 189 (N.S.S.C.); and R. v. Vinette, [1969] 3 C.C.C. 172 at 174 
  (B.C.C.A.).</p>   <P>
  [58] Third, it is important to note that the word &quot;support&quot; has many 
  meanings. In The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 
  1993) the definition of the verb &quot;support&quot; covers almost a full page 
  and is divided into seven principal meanings, including &quot;Strengthen the 
  position of (a person . . .) by one's assistance or backing&quot;, &quot;give 
  confidence or strength to; encourage&quot; and &quot;Occupy a position by the 
  side of (a person) in order to give assistance or encouragement&quot;. In my 
  view, these definitions of the word &quot;support&quot; clearly imply an element 
  of action; indeed, they tend to treat &quot;support&quot; and &quot;encourage&quot; 
  almost as synonyms.</p>   <P>
  [59] Combining these three reasons, the crucial point, in my view, is to examine 
  the trial judge's charge relating to s. 21(1)(c) in its entirety. When I do 
  that, I am certain that the words the trial judge employed - encourage, guide, 
  counsel, support - and his review of the evidence would have left the jury with 
  the proper understanding that Bonnie could be found liable under s. 21(1)(c) 
  only if she played an active role in promoting the crime committed by her son.</p>   <P>
  [60] Bonnie also contends that the trial judge might have left open the possibility 
  that she could be convicted on the basis of having &quot;encouraged&quot; Rochon, 
  without the need to link that encouragement to the homicide. This argument rests 
  on the possibility that the jury could have taken the instruction to mean that 
  it could convict on the basis that Bonnie simply encouraged Rochon's hatred 
  of McAuley, or encouraged him in some other general manner only indirectly linked 
  to the offence. In support of this submission, Bonnie refers to the trial judge's 
  references to moral support, and &quot;setting up&quot; her son, &quot;sort 
  of knowing that he would react eventually&quot;.</p>   <P>
  [61] I do not accept this submission. In my view, the trial judge explicitly 
  linked the idea of encouragement with the offence committed. He said:</p>   
<P class="indent"> [I]n order to find her guilty of murder by this route, you 
  would have to be satisfied that the crown has proven that she actually abetted 
  Rochon, did the counselling as I told you, and intended to abet him to commit 
  the offence of murder.</p>   
<P>
  (ii) Section 21(2)</p>   <P>
  [62] Bonnie submits that liability as a party pursuant to s. 21(2) of the Code 
  should not have been left with the jury because the circumstances relating to 
  the alleged unlawful purpose (to kill William) were indistinguishable from the 
  offence charged (first degree murder): see R. v. Simpson, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 3 
  at 15.</p>   <P>
  [63] I disagree. The trial judge instructed the jury that the unlawful common 
  purpose was to assault William whereas the offence Rochon committed while carrying 
  out the assault was murder. Although there is an overlap in the conduct comprehended 
  by the two offences, that does not detract from the fact that they are separate 
  offences: see R. v. Vang (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 32 at 39 41 (Ont. C.A.); and 
  R. v. Light (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 221 at 253 54 (B.C.C.A.). Moreover, it is 
  important to note that the trial judge instructed on s. 21(2) only with respect 
  to possible verdicts of second degree murder and manslaughter. Bonnie was convicted 
  of first degree murder. Accordingly, even if the judge erred by deciding to 
  include s. 21(2) in his charge (and I conclude he did not), the error is of 
  no moment.</p>   <P>
  (b) Use of Rochon's statements re Bonnie</p>   <P>
  [64] Several Crown witnesses testified about Rochon's statements to them about 
  his desire and intention to kill his step father. According to some of these 
  witnesses, Rochon implicated his mother in this enterprise. Bonnie contends 
  that the trial judge did not adequately caution the jury about the use it could 
  make of this testimony. Specifically, Bonnie submits that the trial judge failed 
  to provide the instruction dealing with several people acting in concert in 
  committing an offence required by R. v. Carter, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938.</p>   <P>
  [65] In the general portion of his charge, the trial judge said:</p>   
<P class="indent"> As I mentioned to you, there have been statements made by one 
  accused that may involve another accused. A statement alleged to have been made 
  by an accused is only evidence in respect of the maker. In other words, if Jason 
  Rochon has made a statement to someone, that statement can only be used against 
  him. You may give it as much weight as you see fit in respect to its maker.</p>
<P class="indent">You must not consider it, however, in respect of any accused 
  other than the accused who is alleged to have made it. It only relates to and 
  may be used in relation to its maker, even if it mentions by name or other description 
  the activities of other accused. </p>
<P class="indent">I will comment a little further upon that because of the question 
  of co accused here and also the question of alleged conspiracy or common intent 
  between the parties. But basically speaking, statements made by one accused 
  is not evidence against the other unless the other accused is present and has 
  adopted it.</p>
<P>
  This was a good general instruction to which Bonnie takes no exception.</p>   <P>
  [66] When he turned to Bonnie's potential liability under s. 21(2), the trial 
  judge said:</p>   
<P class="indent"> You have to be careful when you are looking at statements that 
  have been made by Rochon to others, such as Rochon to Bradley, Rochon to Hale, 
  Rochon to Loken. It is one thing when statements are made by Rochon which tell 
  what he is going to do, but it becomes very difficult when there are statements 
  made as to what his mother was going to do.</p>
<P class="indent">And what I say about that is that before you can even look at 
  those statements, you have to find that there was a common conspiracy between 
  the two of them and that it was murder, in order that the statements made by 
  Rochon about what his mother in other words, to stab him in the lung, whether 
  that could be applied to Bonnie McAuley. You would have to find a common intention 
  before this can happen.</p>
<P class="indent">And the statements have to be made in furtherance of the common 
  intention. In other words, if they are made after all of this has been discussed, 
  after this plot has been launched, then they cannot be used against her. For 
  example, I think one example that comes to mind is the discussion in Bradley's 
  back yard after the bat has been given and after the common intention, if you 
  find that, had been hatched. This is after the fact and really is only a narrative 
  of what may take place.</p>
<P class="indent">So you have to be very, very careful in the use you make of 
  any statement made by Rochon that would bring in Bonnie McAuley, unless she 
  was present, and I cannot recall any of the evidence where she was present.</p>
<P>
  [67] Bonnie objects to the trial judge's use of the word &quot;find&quot; in 
  the above passage and submits that it diminished the Carter requirement that 
  the jury be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Bonnie and Rochon had formed 
  a common intention before considering such statements.</p>   <P>
  [68] I disagree. Early in his charge, after defining reasonable doubt, the trial 
  judge said:</p>   
<P class="indent"> In the course of the charge I will be referring to the Crown 
  proving or establishing something. Or I may refer to your making some finding 
  or being satisfied with something. When I use these expressions, I mean, in 
  all cases, proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>   
<P>
  [69] On a broader plane, it is true that the component of the charge set out 
  above does not track the precise language of Carter. However, in my view, it 
  is very close. Moreover, importantly, from the examples the trial judge chose 
  (e.g. the post offence conversation in Bradley's backyard) and his language 
  (&quot;very, very careful&quot; and &quot;I cannot recall any of the evidence 
  where she was present&quot;), I cannot conclude that there was any risk that 
  the jury misunderstood the use to which it could put Rochon's statements to 
  others which potentially implicated his mother.</p>   <P>
  (3) Joint issues</p>   <P>
  (a) Caution re evidence of Crown witnesses</p>   <P>
  [70] The Crown called as witnesses several of Rochon's friends - Steven Loken, 
  Shawn Bradley, Mike Joanis, Ken Hale, Steven Zetchus and Rebecca Jefferson - 
  who were with him on July 26, 1993. Their testimony was, to varying degrees, 
  crucial to the Crown's case of first degree murder against Rochon. To a lesser 
  extent, the testimony also implicated Bonnie McAuley.</p>   <P>
  [71] The appellants contend that the testimony of these witnesses was highly 
  suspect and that the trial judge did not provide the jury with a sufficiently 
  strong caution about accepting their testimony.</p>   <P>
  [72] The focal point of the appellants' submission on this issue is the testimony 
  of Steven Loken. He was a very good friend of Rochon and a co worker at a nightclub 
  in Hull. He loaned Rochon his car and knew that Rochon and Sheppard intended 
  to confront William McAuley. Loken was arrested and the police told him that 
  they were considering charging him with first degree murder. Within a few hours, 
  Loken provided a statement to police. He subsequently pleaded guilty to obstructing 
  a police officer and received a sentence of probation for three years, 300 hours 
  of community service and a $500 charitable donation.</p>   <P>
  [73] Loken testified at the preliminary inquiry and the trial. There were many 
  inconsistencies among his initial statement to the police, his testimony at 
  the preliminary inquiry and his trial testimony. In addition, he remembered 
  important details that seriously implicated both Rochon and McAuley just before 
  the trial. He also admitted that he was prepared to lie under oath.</p>   <P>
  [74] The appellants contend that in light of these problems, it was incumbent 
  on the trial judge to deliver &quot;a clear and sharp warning&quot; about Loken's 
  testimony: see R. v. Vetrovec, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811 at 831. The appellants submit 
  that the trial judge failed to fulfil this responsibility.</p>   <P>
  [75] I disagree. The nature and strength of a warning about the testimony of 
  a witness is very much a matter in the discretion of the trial judge: see R. 
  v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599 at 610 12 and R. v. Brooks, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 237 
  at 243 44. Moreover, it is important to consider the adequacy of any warning 
  in the context of the jury charge as a whole, and not simply by dissecting the 
  warning portions of the charge: see R. v. Winmill (1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 380 
  at 405 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Harriott (2002), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 494 (Ont. 
  C.A.), aff'd. 2003 SCC 5.</p>   <P>
  [76] Against the backdrop of these principles, I cannot say that the trial judge's 
  caution to the jury about Steven Loken was inadequate. The trial judge gave 
  the jury the standard instruction about how to consider contradictory statements 
  made by witnesses. In addition, on four occasions he provided cautions about 
  Loken's testimony specifically.</p>   <P>
  [77] In the general part of his charge, the trial judge singled out Loken and 
  Bradley for special attention:</p>   
<P class="indent"> With reference to Steve Loken and Bradley, you should view 
  their testimony with great caution and you should look for other supporting 
  evidence before you adopt and accept their evidence. In this case you have the 
  evidence of Rochon, who supports some of the evidence of the various witnesses 
  that I have referred to. During the course of my discussions with you, I will 
  attempt to refer to some of the supporting evidence when I review the evidence 
  of the witnesses.</p>
<P class="indent">In other words, you have heard that Loken was charged and then 
  the charges were reduced. You have to consider his evidence under those circumstances. 
  But you will find at least my view is that you will find a lot of what Rochon 
  says confirms what was told to these people. But that is for you to weigh and 
  for you to consider.</p>
<P>
  [78] In the portion of his charge dealing with Rochon, the trial judge said:</p>   
<P class="indent"> Steven Loken you will recall the conversation that Loken alleges 
  he had with Rochon who told Loken he was going to ask a friend about getting 
  a gun to use on his stepfather. And I talked to you about exercising caution 
  in some of these witnesses such as Loken. You can look to the other witnesses 
  to see whether there is supporting evidence that confirms it, so that the particular 
  conversation about getting a gun seems to tie in with what was said by the previous 
  witness, Zetchus. You may recall him; he was the fence from the Citi Club. As 
  far as Loken's conversation, Rochon didn't recall that.</p>   
<P class="center"> . . . . .</p>   
<P class="indent"> Also, in considering the evidence of Loken, you have to remember 
  that he was originally charged with conspiracy to commit murder. There were 
  outstanding charges. He made a deal, I suppose, if you want to call it that, 
  or plea bargain in a reduced charge. He got a fairly favourable sentence. You 
  will have to consider whether that in itself taints his evidence at all.</p>   
<P>
  [79] In the portion of the charge dealing with Bonnie, the trial judge said:</p>   
<P class="indent"> In considering Bonnie McAuley's conduct, look, as well, at 
  the conversation that Loken alleged took place on the balcony. I have already 
  commented upon how you must look at his evidence with caution. But this conversation 
  was the one where the alibi was being set up. Going to the movie was to be used 
  as an alibi to cover her whereabouts while Rochon and Sheppard carried out the 
  killing, or at least the assault on McAuley. This may be some indication of 
  a common plan or common intention between the two of them to arrange for the 
  death of William McAuley.</p>   
<P>
  [80] In my view, these warnings about Loken's testimony were sufficient. There 
  were four different warnings, two of the warnings (the first and third) were 
  particularly strong, and the trial judge coupled the warnings with some comment 
  about potentially confirmatory evidence, as required by Vetrovec and its progeny.</p>   <P>
  [81] In addition, the trial judge provided specific warnings about the testimony 
  of Shawn Bradley (see above) and Steven Zetchus:</p>   
<P class="indent"> Steven Zetchus was, you recall, the bouncer from Toronto. There 
  was a warrant for his arrest. He admitted that he was a fence, what you would 
  call one of those unsavoury characters, so you have to weigh his evidence very 
  carefully and have to be very cautious about how you apply it. You should look 
  for some other evidence to support what he says.</p>   
<P>
  [82] In summary, the number, nature and strength of the warnings given by the 
  trial judge about the testimony of several Crown witnesses, especially Steven 
  Loken, complied with the requirements of the leading cases in this domain - 
  Vetrovec, Bevan and Brooks.</p>   <P>
  (b) Reasonable doubt</p>   <P>
  [83] The appellants contend that the trial judge's jury charge relating to reasonable 
  doubt was inadequate. The charge was delivered in 1995 before the decision in 
  R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320. The appellants point to three defects in 
  the charge when compared to the model charge set out in Lifchus: first, the 
  trial judge told the jury that &quot;when I speak of reasonable doubt, I use 
  the words in their ordinary and natural meaning, not as a legal term having 
  some special connotation&quot;; second, in addition to instructing the jury 
  that a reasonable doubt is based upon reason and common sense, he ought to have 
  instructed that it must be logically connected to the evidence or the absence 
  of evidence; and third, the trial judge did not make it clear that the criminal 
  standard of proof is substantially higher than the civil standard of proof.</p>   <P>
  [84] In R. v. Rhee, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 364, Arbour J. reviewed the Lifchus charge 
  and subsequent cases in which it has been considered by the Supreme Court of 
  Canada, including R. v. Starr, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, R. v. Beauchamp, [2000] 
  2 S.C.R. 720, R. v. Russell, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 731 and R. v. Avetysan, [2000] 
  2 S.C.R. 745. She said, at pp. 375 76:</p>   
<P class="indent"> Appellate review of a charge to the jury is not a mechanical 
  task, but rather an assessment of whether the deficiencies in the charge, as 
  compared to the Lifchus standard, cause serious concern about the jury's verdict. 
  However, the failure of such charges to reflect Lifchus principles &quot;cannot 
  be taken to raise by that alone the spectre of an unfair trial or miscarriage 
  of justice&quot; (Russell, supra, at para. 24). Rather, the key question to 
  ask is whether the charge in question substantially complies with the principles 
  expressed in Lifchus, so that, as a whole, it does not give rise to the reasonable 
  likelihood that the jury misunderstood the correct standard of proof.</p>   
<P>
  [85] Based on my review of the trial judge's jury charge, I do not conclude 
  that it gave rise to a reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the 
  correct standard of proof. Indeed, although the charge does contain the three 
  defects alleged by the appellants, there are many cases in which jury charges 
  containing these defects have been upheld: see for example, R. v. Rhee, supra; 
  R. v. Feeley, 2003 SCC 7; R. v. Tavenor (2001), 140 O.A.C. 78; R. v. Satkunananthan 
  (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Phillips (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 
  345 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Varga (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 502 (Ont. C.A.); and R. 
  v. Van Nguyen (2002), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 433 (Ont. C.A.).</p>   <P>
  [86] In my view, the trial judge delivered a well organized and well worded 
  jury charge following a long and difficult trial. The components relating to 
  the presumption of innocence and the assessment of the credibility of witnesses 
  were accurate and are important contextual points when considering the charge 
  on reasonable doubt. </p>   <P>
  [87] In summary, based on my review of the trial judge's jury charge and my 
  understanding of the similar cases listed above, I reach the conclusion that 
  the component of the trial judge's charge relating to reasonable doubt complies 
  with the test set out in Rhee.</p>   <P>
