<p>On appeal from the order of Justice W. J. Lloyd Brennan of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 12, 2002.</p>
<p>
  BORINS J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, Zbigniew Belz, appeals from an order of Brennan J. holding 
  him in contempt of court in respect of a beach of confidentiality arising from 
  a mandatory mediation conducted pursuant to Rule 24.1 of the Rules of Civil 
  Procedure. The mediation took place in the context of a libel action brought 
  by the respondent concerning certain articles published in a Polish language 
  newspaper known as Gazeta, of which the appellant was the editor and publisher. 
  For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal. </p>
<p>
  The Facts</p>
<p>
  [2] The mediation session took place on January 15, 2002. The mediator was William 
  R. McMurtry. The parties and their lawyers were present. Prior to the commencement 
  of the mediation, counsel for the parties signed what the court was told was 
  a standard form mediation agreement. Clause 4 of the agreement reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 4. CONFIDENTIALITY</p>
<p class="indent">The mediator will not disclose to anyone who is not a party 
  to the mediation any information or documents submitted to the mediator, EXCEPT: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) to the lawyers, or any experts retained by the parties, 
  as deemed appropriate by the mediator;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) where ordered to do so by judicial authority or where required 
  to do so by law;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) with the written consent of all parties. </p>
<p class="indent">The parties agree that they will not require the mediator to 
  testify in court, to submit any report for use in legal proceedings or otherwise 
  to disclose any written or oral communication that has taken place during the 
  mediation.</p>
<p>
  [3] Mr. McMurtry explained to the parties that it was fundamental to the mediation 
  process that discussions forming part of it be kept confidential. At the end 
  of the mediation agreement he added in handwriting the following clause, which 
  was signed by the parties: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The parties agree that everything that is said or done in the mediation is strictly 
  confidential and privileged, and no reference will be made to anyone other than 
  the parties or their solicitors of anything that is said during the process. 
  </p>
<p>
  [4] On January 16, 2002, the appellant wrote and published in Gazeta an article 
  reporting on the mediation session which reads, in part, as follows [English 
  translation]: </p>
<p class="indent"> No reconciliation was reached in the action brought against 
  Gazeta and its Editors Alicja Gettlich and Zbigniew Belz.</p>
<p class="indent">After a mediation session that lasted for a few hours last Tuesday, 
  Ms. Elzbieta Rogacka, the Plaintiff (let us refresh our memory: a private action 
  taken, corporate money used) rejected the Gazeta editors' proposal which might 
  have served as a basis for reconciliation of the parties. </p>
<p>
  [5] On January 28, 2002, the appellant was examined for discovery. Subsequently, 
  he wrote and published a lengthy article in Gazeta in which he described his 
  experience on being examined for discovery and recalled the content of some 
  of the questions he was asked by the respondent's counsel. In addition, the 
  appellant provided editorial comments concerning some of the questions. </p>
<p>
  The Contempt Motion</p>
<p>
  [6] On the basis of the two articles, the respondent moved for the following 
  orders: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. An order that the defendant, Zbigniew Belz, be found in 
  contempt of court for breach of Rule 24.1.14 of the Rules of Civil Procedure 
  and the Confidentiality Agreement which guard the confidentiality of Mediations;</p>
<p class="indent">2. An order that the defendant, Zbigniew Belz, be found in contempt 
  of court for breach of the deemed undertaking rule.</p>
<p>
  She gave as grounds for her motion, rules 24.1.14, 30.1.01, 60.05 and 60.11 
  of the Rules of Civil Procedure and the &quot;Confidentiality Provision&quot; 
  that Mr. McMurtry added to the mediation agreement. Rule 30.1 is the deemed 
  undertaking rule.</p>
<p>
  [7] In his affidavit in response to the motion, the appellant discussed the 
  two articles. In respect to the first article, he stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> 7. In the meantime a mediation was held on January 15, 2002, 
  which lasted four hours. I was present, along with Mr. Czuma, Mrs. Gettlich, 
  Mrs. Rogacki, two lawyers for Mrs. Rogacki and Mr. McMurtry, the mediator. A 
  great deal was said during those four hours, some of it intemperate since the 
  matters in issue provoked strong emotions on both sides. I did sign the Confidentiality 
  Agreement, and whatever I did write, I did not include any details whatsoever 
  about what was discussed, although a great deal was discussed, and the experience 
  was a very emotional one for everyone concerned. </p>
<p class="indent">8. Gazeta is published five times a week, Monday to Thursday 
  as a regular edition, and on Friday the weekly edition comes out, which includes 
  a supplement. The mediation took place on January 15. The Article appeared in 
  the next day's issue of Gazeta and consisted of a very brief report about the 
  mediation, certainly nothing in terms of length with respect to details of what 
  occurred. We were interested in settling the claim, and I was frustrated that 
  it had not been settled. I do not believe that what I wrote is a contempt of 
  court and was certainly never intended to be an insult to the court and, in 
  my view, does not violate the Confidentiality Agreement. </p>
<p>
  [8] In respect of the second article, the appellant stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  11. Prior to writing the article, I was completely unaware that I was unable 
  to report on this part of the court proceeding. There was no confidentiality 
  agreement signed in advance and neither Mr. Bell, nor my own lawyer, told me 
  that I could not write about my experiences on the Examination for Discovery. 
  I found it an interesting experience, which I thought might interest my readers, 
  who have been following the progress of this law suit in our pages. Had I known 
  that I should not write about it, I certainly would not have written about it 
  and I will never do so again. I did not intend any insult towards the court. 
  As far as I was aware it was a court proceeding, and it could be made public. 
  If there was any offence in what I did, I certainly apologize to the court, 
  but it was entirely unintended. Perhaps Mr. Czuma would not suspect that I would 
  write such an article, but he certainly did not tell me that I could not write 
  such an article. Since he has told me, I have certainly not written any other 
  articles about what happens at the discovery, or released any other confidential 
  information. </p>
<p>
  The Motion Judge's Reasons</p>
<p>
  [9] The motion judge found the appellant in contempt of court in respect to 
  the first article, but not in respect to the second article. </p>
<p>
  [10] In his endorsement, the motion judge wrote: </p>
<p class="indent"> Motion granted. I find the defendant Belz in contempt of court 
  in respect of his breach of the confidentiality of the mediation process. The 
  importance of maintaining that confidentiality is demonstrated by the content 
  of the Rule, elevating &quot;all communications at a mediation session&quot; 
  to (deemed) without prejudice discussions. Further emphasis of that importance 
  should have been apparent to Belz from the fact that the mediator insisted on 
  the parties signing an express agreement on the matter. </p>
<p class="indent">I am not satisfied that publication of information about his 
  own examination for discovery falls within the prohibition found now in Rule 
  30.1 and the deemed undertaking rule as I accept the submission made on his 
  behalf that he consents to its use as Rule 30.1.01(4) provides. Even if some 
  of the information published about his examination does not fall within such 
  consent, I am not satisfied of his wilfulness in that regard, as contempt relief 
  would require. </p>
<p class="indent">As suggested by counsel I am limiting my decision at this point 
  to the finding that Belz's conduct amounts to contempt of court and requires 
  that the court exercise some control of his conduct relating to the process 
  of the court in the future [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [11] In a subsequent endorsement, the motion judge imposed the following sanction 
  on the appellant to &quot;remedy&quot; his contempt: </p>
<p class="indent"> To remedy his contempt I order that Mr. Belz conform with the 
  confidentiality provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure and that he cause 
  to be published on the front page of Gazeta the following text, without comment. 
  The Polish version is to be provided by a translator mutually acceptable to 
  counsel, in accordance with their agreement at the hearing before me on June 
  11, 2002. </p>
<p class="indent">Rogacki v. Belz, Gazeta and Gettlich: <br>
  Publisher Belz found to be in contempt of court.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of Rogacki v. Belz, Gazeta and Gettlich a motion 
  was brought asking the court to find that Zbigniew Belz was in contempt of court. 
  On May 29, 2002 the Superior Court of Justice granted the motion, finding that 
  Mr. Belz was in contempt in allowing the publication of an article in Gazeta 
  No. 11 on January 16, 2002 entitled &quot;The case of the President of the National 
  Council of the Canadian-Polish Congress v. Gazeta: No Reconciliation So Far&quot;. 
  The court found that publication of the story was a willful breach of confidentiality 
  requirements of its Rules of Civil Procedure. </p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Belz has been ordered to conform with the confidentiality 
  provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure and to pay court costs in the amount 
  of $11,700.00 plus GST and disbursements to indemnify the plaintiff in respect 
  of her costs of the motion [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  In addition, the motion judge ordered that the respondent be awarded costs on 
  a substantial indemnity basis. </p>
<p>
  [12] The following paragraphs of the formal judgment of the court are also relevant: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. THIS COURT ORDERS that the defendant Zbigniew Belz is in 
  contempt of court in respect of breach of confidentiality of the mediation process. 
</p>
<p class="indent">3. THIS COURT ORDERS that the defendant Zbigniew Belz pay costs 
  in the amount of $11,700.00 plus GST in the amount of $819.00 plus disbursements 
  in the amount of $380.34 for a total of $12,899.34 to the plaintiff forthwith 
  and in any event of the cause. </p>
<p class="indent">4. THIS COURT ORDERS that the defendant Zbigniew Belz cause 
  to be published on the front page of the weekend edition of Gazeta the text 
  attached as Schedule A hereto as translated into Polish, without comment. </p>
<p class="indent">5. THIS COURT ORDERS that the defendant Zbigniew Belz conform 
  with the confidentiality provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure. </p>
<p>
  Relevant Rules of Civil Procedure</p>
<p>
  [13] The following rules are relevant to this appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> Rule 24.1</p>
<p class="indent">24.1.14 All communications at a mediation session and the mediator's 
  notes and records shall be deemed to be without prejudice settlement discussions. 
</p>
<p class="indent">Rule 30.1</p>
<p class="indent">30.1.01 (1) This Rule applies to,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) evidence obtained under,</p>

<p class="indent">. . .</p>
<p class="indent">(3) All parties and their counsel are deemed to undertake not 
  to use evidence or information to which this Rule applies for any purposes other 
  than those of the proceeding in which the evidence was obtained.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Subrule (3) does not prohibit a use to which the person 
  who disclosed the evidence consents. </p>
<p class="indent">Rule 60</p>
<p class="indent">60.05 An order requiring a person to do an act, other than the 
  payment of money, or to abstain from doing an act, may be enforced against the 
  person refusing or neglecting to obey the order by a contempt order under rule

<p class="indent"><span class="indent">60.11 (1) A contempt order to enforce an 
  order requiring a person to do an act, other than the payment of money, or abstain

<p class="indent"> (5) In disposing of a motion under subrule (1) the judge may 
  make such order as is just, and where a finding of contempt is made, the judge 
  may order that the person in contempt,</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) be imprisoned for such period and on such terms as are 
  just;</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) be imprisoned if he or she fails to comply with a term 
  of the order;</p>
<p class="indent"> (c) pay a fine;</p>
<p class="indent"> (d) do or refrain from doing an act;</p>
<p class="indent"> (e) pay such costs as are just; and</p>

</p>
<p class="indent"> and may grant leave to issue a writ of sequestration under 
  rule 60.09 against the person's property [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  The issues</p>
<p>
  [14] In the respondent's notice of motion for the contempt order she relied 
  on Rule 60 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. In my view, the respondent's reliance 
  on Rule 60 raises the issue of the availability of the contempt power in the 
  circumstances of this case, primarily because of the language of rules 60.05 
  and 60.11(1), which are parts of Rule 60, which is entitled &quot;Enforcement 
  of Orders&quot;. Rule 60.05 provides for the enforcement of &quot;an order requiring 
  a person to do an act... or to abstain from doing an act... by a contempt order 
  under Rule 60.11&quot;. Rule 60.11(1) provides for a contempt order to enforce 
  compliance with such an order &quot;on a motion to a judge in the proceeding 
  in which the order to be enforced was made&quot;. It is also apparent from the 
  language of rule 60.11(5), which contains the sanctions that the court may impose 
  where a finding of contempt is made, that the focus of the contempt power in 
  Rule 60 is the failure of an individual to comply with an order made by the 
  court. (Under Rule 1.03 &quot;order&quot; includes a judgment.) In this case, 
  no order had been made that was enforceable under Rule 60.</p>
<p>
  [15] In seeking the order under appeal, it was the respondent's position that 
  in publishing the article reporting on the result of the mandatory mediation 
  session the appellant was in contempt of court because he was in breach of both 
  rule 24.1.14 and the &quot;Confidentiality Provision&quot; that was added to 
  the mediation agreement. Thus, the first issue to be decided is whether either 
  rule 24.1.14 or the &quot;Confidentiality Provision&quot; is an order within 
  the meaning of Rule 60 and, therefore, capable of enforcement under that rule 
  by a contempt order. </p>
<p>
  [16] If, however, I am of the opinion that neither rule 24.1.14 nor the &quot;Confidentiality 
  Provision&quot; is an order within the meaning of Rule 60, I think that the 
  inherent jurisdiction of the court to invoke the contempt power should be considered 
  if that jurisdiction forms a basis for the order under appeal, notwithstanding 
  the fact that the respondent relied on Rule 60 and not on the inherent jurisdiction 
  of the court. Although, as Morden J.A. pointed out in Forrest v. Lacroix Estate 
  (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 619 at para. 23 (C.A.), rule 60.11(1) &quot;is intended 
  to occupy the field in proceedings under the Rules of Civil Procedure relating 
  to the enforcement of court orders which require an act to be done&quot;, the 
  inherent jurisdiction of the court may be exercised to invoke the contempt power 
  where the impugned conduct does not involve a failure to comply with a court 
  order. See R. v. Bunn (1994), 97 Man. R. (2d) 20 (C.A.); R. v. Vermette, [1987] 
  1 S.C.R. 577. In the circumstances of this case, under the inherent jurisdiction 
  of the court, the second issue then becomes whether the articles written and 
  published by the appellant, or either of them, constitute a contempt of court 
  as recognized by the Canadian authorities. </p>
<p>
  The Rule 60 issue</p>
<p>
  [17] In my opinion, Rule 60 was not available to the respondent as the foundation 
  for a contempt order based on the article written and published by the appellant 
  reporting on the result of the mandatory mediation session. Rule 60, and in 
  particular rules 60.05 and 60.11(1), by their plain language provide for a contempt 
  order to enforce a court order. There was no order of the court prohibiting 
  the publication of the article. Indeed, in her notice of motion the respondent 
  did not rely on the appellant's breach of a court order. The grounds for her 
  motion were &quot;breach of Rule 24.1.14... and the Confidentiality Agreement&quot; 
  signed by the parties at the outset of the mediation session. The respondent 
  has provided no authority that the breach of a rule of court or a private agreement 
  is equivalent to an order of the court within the meaning of Rule 60, and I 
  have been unable to locate any such authority. The Rules of Civil Procedure 
  contain many sanctions where a party has failed to comply with a rule of court. 
  In the few instances where a contempt order is provided as a sanction for failing 
  to comply with a rule, as in rules 34.15(2) and 69.14(9), such sanction is expressly 
  provided. Had the Civil Rules Committee, in the exercise of its powers under 
  s. 66(2)(s) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, intended to 
  provide that the contempt power may be used to enforce the obligations imposed 
  on litigants under rule 24.1, it would have done so expressly. </p>
<p>
  [18] In my respectful opinion, the motion judge not only misapprehended the 
  contempt power contained in Rule 60, but he also misinterpreted rule 24.1.14. 
  As I understand his reasons, as reflected in paragraph 1 of the formal order 
  of the court, the motion judge appeared to interpret rule 24.1.14 as providing 
  for the &quot;confidentiality of the mediation process&quot;. (A similar misapprehension 
  of rule 24.1.14 is reflected in paragraph 5 of the order which required the 
  appellant to &quot;conform with the confidentiality provisions of the Rules 
  of Civil Procedure&quot;.) This is not what rule 24.1.14 states, nor is there 
  any other subrule within Rule 24.1 that addresses the confidentiality of the 
  mandatory mediation process. By deeming &quot;all communications at a mediation 
  session and the mediator's notes and records... to be without prejudice settlement 
  discussions&quot;, rule 24.1.14 codifies the principle that communications made 
  without prejudice in an attempt to resolve a dispute are not admissible in evidence 
  unless they result in a concluded resolution of the dispute. As such, rule 24.1.14 
  is a necessary ingredient of Rule 24.1 as it furthers the public interest in 
  promoting free and frank settlement discussions by protecting communications 
  for that purpose from compelled disclosure in subsequent proceedings involving 
  the parties to the settlement discussions, such as discovery or trial, in circumstances 
  where the mediation fails to resolve the litigation. In this regard, Clause 
  4 of the mediation agreement is consistent with the purpose of rule 24.1.14. 
  Another rule, which serves a purpose similar to rule 24.1.14 is rule 50.03 which 
  precludes disclosure of communications made at a pre?trial hearing at a subsequent 
  trial or motion. See Bell Canada v. Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. (1994), 
  17 O.R. (3d) 135 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  The inherent jurisdiction issue</p>
<p>
  [19] Having found that a motion for a contempt order under Rule 60 was not available 
  to the respondent in respect of the article published by the appellant reporting 
  on the result of the mandatory mediation session, I turn to whether the inherent 
  jurisdiction of the court may be exercised to sanction the appellant for publishing 
  the article. I will include within my analysis the second article, in respect 
  of which the respondent had unsuccessfully sought a contempt order under Rule 
  60 on the ground that its publication was in breach of Rule 30.1, the deemed 
  undertaking rule. In this article, the appellant discussed his experience when 
  he was examined for discovery. Although there is no cross?appeal from the dismissal 
  of the contempt motion respecting this article, in her factum the respondent 
  suggested that the publication of the article infringed Rule 30.1. In my view 
  the motion judge was correct in dismissing the contempt motion for reasons that 
  I will outline subsequently. </p>
<p>
  [20] For the appellant to be found in contempt of court in respect of either 
  article, the respondent was required to prove that the appellant did the relevant 
  act (actus reus) with the necessary intent (mens rea). There is no doubt that 
  the appellant published the articles. However, to complete the actus reus it 
  was also necessary for the respondent to prove that the articles had some significant 
  adverse effect on the administration of justice. If the respondent proved the 
  actus reus, it would then be necessary for her to prove that the appellant published 
  the articles with the necessary intent. </p>
<p>
  [21] There are many forms of contempt of court. The publication of the two articles 
  comes closest to that form of contempt embraced by the sub judice rule, which 
  seeks to avoid prejudicing the fair trial of pending litigation by precluding 
  the publication of material that would have that effect. As such, the sub judice 
  rule represents the intersection of two principles of fundamental importance: 
  freedom of expression, and the rule of law which precludes interference with 
  the administration of justice. As stated by Jeffrey Miller in The Law of Contempt 
  in Canada (Scarborough, Ont.: Carswell, 1997) at pp. 101-102, the leading case 
  in Canada on this subject remains Attorney General v. Times Newspapers Ltd., 
  [1973] 3 All E.R. 54 (H.L.), from which the author extracted the following principles 
  to be considered in assessing an impugned pre?trial publication: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) The issues must not be prejudged in a manner likely to 
  affect the mind of the trier of fact.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Contempt exists only if there is a real risk of prejudice 
  as opposed to a mere possibility of interference with the due administration 
  of justice.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The rule applies even if the litigation is in a quiescent 
  stage, such as during protracted settlement discussions.</p>
<p>
  [22] Although civil contempts, as in this case, and criminal contempts take 
  a variety of forms, it is important to emphasize that each involves an interference 
  with the due administration of justice. Indeed, contempt of court, both civil 
  and criminal, has existed for centuries. It is the mechanism used by the court 
  to ensure compliance with its orders and to protect its process. As such, it 
  is a sanction that serves the administration of justice in the public interest.</p>
<p>
  [23] It is helpful to repeat what was said by Dickson C.J.C. in B.C.G.E.U. v. 
  British Columbia (Attorney General), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 214 at 234: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In some instances the phrase &quot;contempt of court&quot; may be thought to 
  be unfortunate because, as in the present case, it does not posit any particular 
  aversion, abhorrence or disdain of the judicial system. In a legal context the 
  phrase is much broader than the common meaning of &quot;contempt&quot; might 
  suggest and embraces &quot;where a person, whether a party to a proceeding or 
  not, does any act which may tend to hinder the course of justice or show disrespect 
  to the court's authority&quot;, &quot;interfering with the business of the court 
  on the part of a person who has no right to do so&quot;, &quot;obstructing or 
  attempting to obstruct the officers of the Court on their way to their duties&quot;: 
  see Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law, 2nd ed., vol. 1, at p. 441. </p>
<p>
  [24] I find nothing in the record that would support a finding of contempt with 
  respect to either article. As for the first article, it reported that a mandatory 
  mediation session had taken place that did not result in a settlement of the 
  respondent's claim. The second article was concerned with the appellant's perception 
  of his examination for discovery interspersed with some comments critical of 
  the questions that he had been asked. Although it would have been better in 
  the circumstances of this hotly contested litigation had the appellant not published 
  the articles, as I have explained, I find nothing in Rule 24.1 that precluded 
  him from publishing the first article. Nor, as I will explain, did Rule 30.1 
  preclude him from publishing the second article. As he explained in his affidavit, 
  in writing the articles he did not intend an insult to the court. In my view, 
  each article has not been demonstrated to constitute a contempt of court. There 
  is nothing in either article that was prejudicial to the respondent and that 
  could have compromised a fair trial. Indeed, the respondent presented no evidence 
  to that end. </p>
<p>
  [25] Earlier I expressed agreement with the motion judge's dismissal of the 
  contempt motion arising from the appellant's publication of the article about 
  his own examination for discovery. However, in my view the motion judge was 
  not correct in dismissing the motion on the application of rule 30.1.01(4) which, 
  as I will explain, in the circumstances of this case does not apply.</p>
<p>
  [26] This motion was brought on the ground that the article was in &quot;breach 
  of the deemed undertaking rule&quot;, which is Rule 30.1. The motion judge dismissed 
  the motion because he was of the view &quot;that the appellant's publication 
  of information about his own examination for discovery&quot; did not fall &quot;within 
  the prohibition found now in Rule 30.1 and the deemed undertaking rule&quot;. 
  He was further of the view that because the appellant &quot;consented&quot; 
  to the &quot;use&quot; of the information, rule 30.1(4) permitted its use for 
  purposes other than those of the proceedings in which the information was obtained.</p>
<p>
  [27] In my view, the motion judge was correct in concluding that the deemed 
  undertaking provided by rule 30.1(3) did not apply in the circumstances of this 
  case. The deemed, or implied, undertaking rule at common law was thoroughly 
  discussed by Morden A.C.J.O. on behalf of this court in Goodman v. Rossi (1995), 
  24 O.R. (3d) 359 (C.A.). As explained in Rossi, there is an implied undertaking 
  by the discovering party to a proceeding to whom testimony or documents are 
  provided by the discovered party in the course of the discovery process that 
  he or she will not use such information for purposes other than those of the 
  proceeding in which the testimony or documents were obtained. Because the undertaking 
  is to the court, its breach gives rise to direct sanctions that a court may 
  impose, such as a finding of contempt of court, and can be relieved or modified 
  by an order of the court. See, also, Orfus Realty v. D.G. Jewellery of Canada 
  Ltd. (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 379 (C.A.). Subsequent to the decision in Rossi, and 
  based on it, the Civil Rules Committee introduced Rule 30.1.</p>
<p>
  [28] The documents and testimony obtained from the discovered party are protected 
  by the deemed undertaking from improper use by the discovering party. Under 
  Rule 30.1 the discovered party is not constrained from any use of his testimony 
  or the documents elicited by the discovering party. It is the discovering party's 
  use of information obtained from the discovered party for a purpose other than 
  that of the litigation in which it was obtained that is precluded by Rule 30.1. 
  See Tanner v. Clark (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 508 (C.A.). It follows, as the appellant 
  was the discovered party, that in publishing the article recounting his experience 
  on being examined for discovery he did not infringe Rule 30.1. In the circumstances, 
  therefore, rule 30.1.01(4) has no application. Nevertheless, the motion judge 
  correctly dismissed the contempt motion based on the publication of the discovery 
  article.</p>
<p>
  [29] I would apply the following passage from the reasons of Dubin J.A. in R. 
  v. Kopyto (1987), 62 O.R. (2d) 449 at 525-526 (C.A.) to the circumstances of 
  this case: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Is was essential for the Crown to prove that the statement made by the appellant 
  was calculated to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. That is 
  the actus reus of this offence. The mere fact that the words are capable of 
  bringing the administration of justice into disrepute does not suffice. What 
  must be shown is that, by reason of the statement made by the appellant, there 
  was a serious risk that the administration of justice would be interfered with. 
  The risk of prejudice must be serious, real or substantial. </p>
<p>
  [30] To this I would add the following passage written by Lord Reid in Times 
  Newspapers Ltd., supra, at p. 60, quoted with approval by Dubin J.A. in Kopyto 
  at p. 512: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The law on this subject is and must be founded entirely on public policy. It 
  is not there to protect the private rights of parties to a litigation or prosecution. 
  It is there to prevent interference with the administration of justice and it 
  should in my judgment be limited to what is reasonably necessary for that purpose. 
  Public policy generally requires a balancing of interests which may conflict. 
  Freedom of speech should not be limited to any greater extent than is necessary 
  but it cannot be allowed where there would be real prejudice to the administration 
  of justice [emphasis added by Dubin J.A.].</p>
<p>
  [31] I find nothing in either article that even suggests the risk of serious, 
  real or substantial prejudice to the administration of justice.</p>
<p>
  [32] I conclude with the observation, found in many of the authorities, that 
  it is a serious matter for a person to be found in contempt of court. Even in 
  a case of civil contempt such as this, a contempt proceeding is punitive in 
  nature with broad powers given to the court including the power to order imprisonment. 
  Because of the criminal nature of contempt proceedings, the person who is its 
  object has many of the safeguards accorded a person accused of a criminal offence. 
  The onus is on the applicant to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See 
  Bhatnager v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 
  217. Given the gravity of a finding of contempt, the court's contempt power 
  should be exercised with scrupulous care and only when the circumstances are 
  clear and beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  Result</p>
<p>
  [33] For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal with costs, set aside 
  paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the order of the motion judge, and in their place 
  make an order dismissing in its entirety the respondent's motion for contempt 
  with costs. The parties are to address the costs of the motion and the appeal 
  by way of written submissions. The appellant is to provide the Senior Legal 
  Officer with his submissions on costs and his bill of costs within 15 days from 
  the release of these reasons. The respondent may file her submissions within 
  7 days after the receipt of the appellant's submissions. The appellant may respond 
  within 7 days thereafter. </p>
<p> &quot;S. Borins J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree Robert P. Armstrong J.A.&quot;</p>

<p>
  ABELLA J.A. (Concurring): </p>
<p>
  [34] I have had the benefit of reading the excellent reasons of Borins J.A. 
  While I agree with his conclusions, I think this appeal raises important policy 
  questions about the mandatory mediation process. </p>
<p>
  [35] Rule 24.1 compels parties to attend a mediation and to exchange information. 
  Rule 24.1.14 provides that the settlement discussions are &quot;without prejudice&quot;. 
  </p>
<p>
  [36] I agree with Borins J.A. that rule 24.1.14 does not create an enforceable 
  guarantee of confidentiality, but that does not mean that there do not exist 
  significant public policy reasons for keeping the mediation sessions confidential. 
  </p>
<p>
  [37] The purpose of protecting confidentiality in the mandatory mediation process 
  is to further the public policy goal of encouraging settlement discussions. 
  The particular significance of upholding confidentiality in mandatory mediation 
  within the legal system is explained by Jonnette Watson Hamilton in her article, 
  &quot;Protecting Confidentiality in Mandatory Mediation: Lessons from Ontario 
  and Saskatchewan&quot; (1999) 24 Queen's L.J. 561 at 574 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> In any process forced upon parties, they must have confidence 
  in the integrity of the process and those who have a major role in it. One of 
  the results of requiring mediators to testify or produce documents may be a 
  perception that the mediator, the program or the process itself does not keep 
  confidences. While such a perception might normally cause parties to avoid mediation, 
  they cannot do so where it is mandatory. They might, however, treat mediation 
  as a mere formality.</p>
<p class="indent">Treating mediation as a formality would frustrate the goals 
  of annexing it to the legal system. The goals of mandatory mediation include 
  efficiency improvements for court systems and administrators by relieving case 
  load pressures and reducing delay and cost for litigants, qualitative improvements 
  for participants through more satisfying or more appropriate procedures and 
  outcomes, relationship preservation and improvement and community and responsibility 
  building. Indeed, if participation in mediation becomes merely an empty gesture, 
  then the legal system will become less efficient, and the parties less satisfied 
  rather than more. [citations omitted].</p>
<p> (See also Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Paul (2001), 198 D.L.R. (4th) 633 
  at 643 (T.D.) per Sexton J.A.; Owen V. Grey, &quot;Protecting the Confidentiality 
  of Communications in Mediation&quot; (1998) 36 Osgoode Hall L.J. 667 at 677; 
  David Vaver, &quot;Without Prejudice Communications - Their Admissibility and 
  Effect&quot; (1974) 9 U.B.C.L. Rev. 85 at 94; and Lawrence Boulle and Kathleen 
  Kelly, Mediation: Principles, Process, Practice (Markham: Butterworths, 1998)).</p>
<p>
  [38] The failure to protect confidentiality could profoundly prejudice the effectiveness 
  of mandatory mediation. It is difficult to see how anyone would agree to be 
  open and frank in discussions designed to effect settlement - discussions they 
  have no choice about participating in - when there is no protection for the 
  confidentiality of the process. </p>
<p>
  [39] A useful analogy can be made, it seems to me, with the implied undertaking 
  found to be crucial to the integrity of the discovery process in Goodman v. 
  Rossi (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 359 (C.A.). This court held that much like an order, 
  statutory rules for examinations for discovery require disclosure of relevant 
  evidence, and as a result, the court can cite for contempt anyone who breaches 
  an implied undertaking not to use discovery evidence for a collateral or ulterior 
  purpose. </p>
<p>
  [40] At p. 370 of Goodman v. Rossi, Morden A.C.J.O explained the basis for the 
  implied undertaking rule and the availability of contempt to sanction its breaches. 
  Citing Prudential Assurance Company v. Fountain Page Limited [1991] 1 W.L.R. 
  756 at 764-65 (Q.B.) per Hobhouse J., he said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The rational basis for the rule is that where one party compels another, either 
  by the enforcement of a rule of court or a specific order of the court, to disclose 
  documents or information whether that other wishes to or not, the party obtaining 
  the disclosure is given this power because the invasion of the other party's 
  rights has to give way to the need to do justice between those parties in the 
  pending litigation between them; it follows from this that the results of such 
  compulsion should likewise be limited to the purpose for which the order was 
  made, namely, the purposes of that litigation then before the court between 
  those parties and not for any other litigation or matter or any collateral purpose: 
  see, for example, per Lord Keith of Kinkel in Home Office v. Harman [1983] 1 
  A.C. 280, 308 [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [41] Again referring to Prudential, supra at pp. 764-65, Morden A.C.J.O. aptly 
  described the implied undertaking in connection with discoveries as follows 
  at p. 370: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is an obligation which arises from legal process and therefore is within 
  the control of the court, gives rise to direct sanctions which the court may 
  impose (viz. contempt of court) and can be relieved or modified by an order 
  of the court. </p>
<p>
  [42] Morden A.C.J.O. emphasized the necessity of having a contempt of court 
  order available as a remedy to protect confidentiality during the discovery 
  process at p. 371: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I think that there would be a serious gap in the range of possible sanctions 
  for breach of the obligation not to make improper use of documents disclosed 
  on discovery, if it were not associated with an implied undertaking to the court 
  and, therefore, capable of giving rise to a contempt of court order.</p>
<p>
  [43] This analysis is equally applicable to mandatory mediation, and, it seems 
  to me, compels the same protection that the implied undertaking in discoveries 
  affords. Just as parties to litigation are compelled by the discovery rules 
  to disclose information they might not otherwise disclose, so too parties falling 
  within the scope of Rule 24.1 are required to attend a mediation session and 
  are required to submit certain information in the mediation process. </p>
<p>
  [44] It is true that the purpose of mandatory mediation is to settle a dispute 
  outside of the court's process, and, as in discovery, it is not conducted by 
  a judge. But it is also true that aspects of mandatory mediation directly engage 
  the court's process. First and foremost, the fact that mediation is mandated 
  by the commencement of a proceeding under the rules, directly implicates the 
  mediation in the court's process. Rule 24.1.09 provides that the mediation session 
  shall take place within 90 days after the first defence has been filed. Rule 
  24.1.10 provides that at least seven days before the mediation, each party is 
  to prepare a form that identifies the factual and legal issues in dispute, briefly 
  sets out the position and interests of the party making the statement and, requiring 
  the &quot;party making the statement [to] attach to it any documents that the 
  party considers of central importance to the action&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [45] In addition, Rule 24.1 sets out what conduct constitutes non-compliance: 
  failure to provide a copy of a statement of issues to the mediator and the other 
  parties; failure to provide a copy of the pleadings to the mediator and failure 
  to attend within the first thirty minutes of the scheduled mediation session. 
  Upon the occurrence of any of these events, a party files a certificate of non-compliance 
  with the mediation co-ordinator, who then refers the matter to a case management 
  master or judge who in turn can convene a case conference and make a number 
  of orders pursuant to rule 24.1.13(2) such as an order striking pleadings, to 
  pay costs, or &quot;any other order that is just&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [46] And while the mediation is mandatory, rule 24.1.05 provides that the court 
  may make an order on a party's motion exempting its action from mandatory mediation, 
  a course of conduct the courts have been rare to indulge. (See O. (G.) v. H. 
  (C.D.) (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 82 at 85 (S.C.J.)). </p>
<p>
  [47] Mandatory mediation is a compulsory part of the court's process for resolving 
  disputes in civil litigation. Wilful breaches of the confidentiality it relies 
  on for its legitimacy, in my view, represent conduct that can create a serious 
  risk to the full and frank disclosures the mandatory mediation process requires. 
  It can significantly prejudice the administration of justice and, in particular, 
  the laudable goal reflected in Rule 24.1 of attempting to resolve disputes effectively 
  and fairly without the expense of a trial. </p>
<p>
  [48] However, given the potential gravity of the consequences of a contempt 
  finding, it should only be exercised, as Borins J.A. indicated, &quot;when the 
  circumstances are clear and beyond reasonable doubt&quot;. In the absence of 
  a Rule or legislative provision explicitly declaring what most lawyers and participants 
  to the mandatory mediation process likely assume, namely, that is confidential, 
  no such clarity exists at this time sufficient to justify attracting so powerful 
  a remedy.</p>
<p>
  [49] I therefore agree with Borins J.A. that the appeal should be allowed.</p>
