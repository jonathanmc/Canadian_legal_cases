<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by and the sentence imposed by Justice 
  Paul H. Megginson of the Ontario Court of Justice on October 24, 2000.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant was convicted of sexual assault pursuant to s. 246(1) of the 
  Criminal Code and touching for a sexual purpose pursuant to s. 146(1) of the 
  Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 13 months imprisonment, concurrent on each 
  count. His appeal is from both conviction and sentence. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant was living in a common law relationship with the mother of 
  the complainant. During the summer of 1988, when the complainant was 14 years 
  old, she had been having problems with her back due to a scoliosis condition. 
  According to the evidence of the complainant, the appellant visited her bedroom 
  in the mornings before he went to work and gave her back massages.</p>
<p>
  [3] The complainant testified that during the course of a few months, the appellant 
  continued to provide these massages on a sporadic basis and eventually he began 
  to place his hand further down her side and touch her breasts. On one occasion, 
  he asked her to turn over in order to feel her breasts. He told her that her 
  body was acting sexually and he was just responding to it. </p>
<p>
  [4] She testified that on subsequent occasions, the appellant put his hand between 
  her legs and rubbed her vagina and stuck his finger inside. He again told her 
  that her body was sexually active and he was responding to it. </p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant testified in his own defence. He admitted that he provided 
  back massages to the complainant. He testified that the back rubs had been recommended 
  by a health care professional. According to his evidence, during one of those 
  back massages she experienced an orgasm which he discussed with her. During 
  the discussion, she complained about having sore breasts and asked him to look 
  at them. The appellant testified that he thought he reached over and touched 
  her breast and told her it was growing. After this incident, he did not again 
  provide any back massages.</p>
<p>
  [6] While the trial judge did not give extensive reasons, it is clear that he 
  accepted the evidence of the complainant, which he found was confirmed by her 
  prompt complaint to her mother, and the appellant's lack of &quot;any credible 
  explanation for the admitted acts of 'bare skin back rubs', and discussing with 
  the complainant her sexual development, rather than leaving these matters to 
  the mother&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant raised the following grounds of appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> AS TO CONVICTION</p>
<p class="indent">(a) The trial judge misapprehended the evidence of the complainant;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) The trial judge improperly shifted the burden to the appellant 
  to offer a credible explanation for his conduct;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) The trial judge erred in finding that the appellant convicted 
  himself out of his own mouth;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) The verdicts are inconsistent with the trial judge having 
  found him not guilty of further counts of sexual assault and touching for a 
  sexual purpose;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) The conviction is unreasonable and cannot be supported by 
  the evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">AS TO SENTENCE</p>
<p class="indent">(a) The sentence is harsh and excessive, given the findings 
  made by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [8] On the appeal before us, the appellant sought to lead fresh evidence through 
  an affidavit of his son who had lived with his father and the complainant and 
  her family between the ages of three years and eight years. The son had been 
  unavailable at the time of the trial because he was in the custody of provincial 
  authorities in Manitoba. The thrust of his proposed evidence was that, while 
  living with the complainant's family, he had been subject to severe physical 
  abuse at the hands of the complainant's mother and brother, some of which was 
  witnessed by the complainant. </p>
<p>
  [9] It was not entirely clear why the appellant wished to put the affidavit 
  evidence of his son before this court. However, during the course of the trial, 
  there was some evidence led on the issue of the alleged abuse of the appellant's 
  son on the theory that the charges before the court were brought by the complainant 
  in retaliation for allegations previously made against her brother and mother. 
  While it is doubtful that the proposed fresh evidence satisfies the test for 
  admission in R. v. Palmer and Palmer, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, we did read it. Nevertheless 
  on the view that we take of this appeal, it is not necessary to rely upon it. 
  </p>
<p>
  [10] We have concluded that the trial judge erred when he accepted that the 
  appellant's lack of any credible explanation for the admitted acts of bare skin 
  back rubs and discussing with the complainant her sexual development rather 
  than leaving these matters to the mother were confirmatory of the complainant's 
  testimony. </p>
<p>
  [11] The appellant's admission that he performed the back rubs confirms the 
  complainant's testimony to the extent that the appellant had the opportunity 
  to commit the offences. The fact that he had no credible explanation for why 
  he did so is not, however, confirmatory. Unfortunately, the trial judge appears 
  to have used the latter reasoning. There are two problems. He seems to use disbelief 
  of the appellant as positive evidence of guilt and, in consequence, shifts the 
  burden on the accused to provide an explanation. Those are serious errors.</p>
<p>
  [12] We would not give effect to the other grounds of appeal. </p>
<p>
  [13] In the result, we would set aside the convictions and order a new trial. 
  It is not necessary, therefore, to deal with the sentence appeal.</p>
