<p>On appeal from the conviction returned by a jury presided over by Justice David 
  Watt, of the Superior Court of Justice, dated April 13, 1999.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant was convicted of the first degree murder of eleven year old 
  Alison Parrott. Alison was lured from her home, abducted, sexually assaulted, 
  murdered and left in a park in the west end of Toronto. The murder occurred 
  in 1986, but went unsolved. By 1996, advances in DNA technology allowed the 
  police to match DNA from sperm found in Alison's vagina to the appellant. The 
  DNA match was not contested at trial. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant was questioned about Alison's disappearance in 1986. He denied 
  any knowledge of that disappearance and gave the police a detailed account of 
  his whereabouts on the relevant weekend.</p>
<p> [3] The appellant was arrested in 1996 after the police matched his DNA to 
  the DNA recovered from Alison's body. The investigating officer conducted an 
  eight hour videotaped interview with the appellant on the day of his arrest. 
  This interview began some eight hours after the appellant was arrested. In the 
  course of the prolonged interview, the appellant: </p>
<ul>
  <li>said he had come across Alison's body in the park while out for a run;</li>
  <li>hinted that he had some kind of contact with her body that would explain 
    the presence of his DNA; and</li>
  <li>denied that he had any part in the abduction, sexual assault or murder of 
    Alison.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [4] At trial, it was argued that the appellant's statement was inadmissible. 
  Counsel argued primarily that it was involuntary, but also that it was taken 
  in a manner that breached the appellant's right to silence as found in s. 7 
  of the Charter. The trial judge rejected both arguments and admitted the statement. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant, who did not testify on the voir dire to determine the admissibility 
  of the statement, did testify at trial. He testified that he came across Alison's 
  body while running through the park. He had stopped to urinate and found her 
  body as he was about to resume his run. For some reason, which he made no attempt 
  to explain, the appellant said that he put his finger into Alison's vagina. 
  He said that he had masturbated earlier that morning and had not washed afterwards. 
  His semen had somehow transferred from his penis to his hand and then to Alison's 
  vagina. </p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant did not tell the police that he had come across Alison's body 
  or the contact that he alleged that he had with her body when he was questioned 
  in 1986. This story first emerged after the appellant became aware that the 
  police had DNA evidence. </p>
<p>
  [7] The admissibility of the appellant's statement was the only ground of appeal. 
  Mr. Kapoor argues that the appellant's right to silence under s. 7 of the Charter 
  was violated and that the statement should have been excluded under s. 24(2) 
  of the Charter. He does not challenge the voluntariness of the statement. </p>
<p>
  [8] Counsel contends that the trial judge conflated the question of voluntariness 
  with the question of whether the police had violated the appellant's right to 
  silence. He argues that the trial judge viewed both voluntariness and the right 
  to silence as turning on whether the appellant had an operating mind when he 
  spoke to the police. Counsel submits that apart entirely from the appellant's 
  capacity to make an informed choice to speak to the police, the right to silence 
  is infringed if, objectively viewed, the police conduct goes beyond permissible 
  means of persuasion. Counsel contend that at the outset of the interview, the 
  appellant made it clear that he wished to remain silent. The investigating officer 
  chose to ignore the appellant's expression of the right to silence and, through 
  a variety of techniques which went beyond legitimate persuasion, effectively 
  denied the appellant the right to exercise his right to silence. </p>
<p>
  [9] Despite Mr. Kapoor's attractive presentation, we are satisfied that this 
  submission cannot succeed. The trial judge clearly linked the voluntariness 
  argument and the claim that the appellant had been denied his right to silence. 
  That link exists both in law and on the facts of this case. The trial judge 
  also emphasized the voluntariness argument as that was the argument pressed 
  at trial. The trial judge did not, however, view the right to silence as subsumed 
  by or the same as the voluntariness argument. Nor did he consider the right 
  to silence claim only from the perspective of whether the appellant had an operating 
  mind. The trial judge addressed the right to silence in his detailed reasons. 
  He accurately set out the operative legal principles and referred to the leading 
  authorities from the Supreme Court of Canada. Quoting from R. v. Hebert (1990), 
  57 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 39 (S.C.C.), the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  What is fundamental to the right to silence, and must not be taken away by agents 
  of the state, is the right to choose whether to speak to the authorities or 
  to remain silent: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The right to choose whether or not to speak to the authorities is defined objectively 
  rather than subjectively. The basic requirement that the suspect possess an 
  operating mind has a subjective element. But this established, the focus under 
  the Charter shifts to the conduct of the authorities vis-&agrave;-vis the subject. 
  Was the suspect accorded the right to consult counsel? Was there other police 
  conduct which effectively and unfairly deprived the suspect of the right to 
  choose whether to speak to the authorities or not?</p>
<p>
  [10] The trial judge then put the principle in his own words: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There is no prohibition against police questioning an accused in the absence 
  of counsel after the accused has retained counsel. And there is nothing wrong 
  with police trying to persuade an accused to speak to them about a crime. But 
  investigators must not deny the accused the right to choose, or deprive him 
  or her of an operating mind. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [11] The trial judge clearly appreciated that the nature of the police conduct 
  and its connection to the accused's decision to continue to speak to the police 
  had to be carefully evaluated in assessing the appellant's claim that his right 
  to silence had been violated. The trial judge dealt at length with the numerous 
  aspects of the police conduct in the course of the interview which it was said 
  rendered the statement inadmissible, including the officer's stated intention 
  to keep the appellant talking. The trial judge addressed the police conduct 
  both as it related to the voluntariness claim and the right to silence claim, 
  although as he observed, it was agreed there was a significant overlap. The 
  trial judge's ultimate conclusion on the right to silence is found at para. 
  335 of his reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is worth recall that the state is not obliged to protect a suspect or accused 
  against making a statement. To the contrary, the state may use legitimate means 
  of persuasion to encourage the suspect or accused to do so. See, R. v. Hebert, 
  above, at p. 35 per McLachlin J. Nothing that happened here denied Francis Carl 
  Roy the right to choose whether to speak or remain silent, deprived him of an 
  operating mind, or otherwise raises a reasonable doubt about the voluntariness 
  of what he said.</p>
<p>
  [12] The right to choose whether to speak to the police lies at the heart of 
  the right to silence. The trial judge's findings of fact doom any argument that 
  the appellant was denied that right. The trial judge viewed the eight hour videotape 
  over the course of three court days. He heard evidence and extensive argument. 
  His review of the evidence on the voir dire and his findings of fact consume 
  over 80 pages. None of the trial judge's factual findings were or could be challenged 
  on appeal. On the trial judge's findings, the appellant, who had met with counsel 
  prior to the interview and was fully aware of his right to silence, had decided 
  from the outset of the interview to tell the police certain things and remain 
  silent about other things. The trial judge's reasons are replete with findings 
  of fact that deny the basic premise of the appellant's right to silence argument. 
  On those findings, the appellant never wanted to remain silent (e.g. see the 
  trial judge's reasons at para. 4, 331-332, 345-346). On the trial judge's findings, 
  the appellant stuck to his &quot;game plan&quot; throughout the interview, answering 
  some questions, declining to answer other questions and posing questions to 
  the investigating officer as he saw fit. Quite simply, on the trial judge's 
  findings, the appellant never chose to exercise his right to silence.</p>
<p>
  [13] This was a prolonged interview of a detained person. The appellant declined 
  to answer questions on many occasions. These features of the interview invite 
  close judicial scrutiny of the admissibility of the statement. Clearly, the 
  repeated assertion by a detained person during a lengthy interview that he does 
  not want to speak to the police any further will provide strong and sometimes 
  conclusive evidence that any subsequent statement was not the product of a free 
  exercise of the detainee's right to choose whether to speak. The question is, 
  however, a factual question to be decided on a case by case basis by the trial 
  judge. On the facts as found by this trial judge, the appellant never chose 
  to remain silent. </p>
<p>
  [14] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
