<p>On appeal from the final order of Justice Donald R. Cameron of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated December 12, 2002. </p>
<p>
  LABROSSE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, Katherine Matutschovsky, appeals the order of Cameron J., 
  granting the Royal Bank of Canada (&quot;the Bank&quot;) judgment, in accordance 
  with the terms of Minutes of Settlement, pursuant to rule 49.09(a) of the Rules 
  of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194. </p>
<p>
  [2] The Bank commenced an action against the other named defendants for money 
  owing under a loan and against the appellant on her guarantee. The appellant 
  filed a statement of defence claiming that she did not understand the documents 
  that she signed, non est factum and lack of independent legal advice. Default 
  judgment was obtained against all defendants except the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [3] On March 8, 2002, the appellant, acting in person, attended to be cross-examined 
  on her affidavit filed on a pending motion for summary judgment. The cross-examination 
  did not proceed and, instead, after lengthy settlement discussions, counsel 
  for the Bank and the appellant signed Minutes of Settlement reducing an offer 
  from the Bank of $58,000.00, all inclusive, to $52,000.00. In its statement 
  of claim, the Bank had claimed $51,282.32 plus interest from August 29, 2001.</p>
<p>
  [4] Within hours of the execution of the Minutes of Settlement, the appellant 
  resiled from the settlement claiming that it failed to acknowledge that she 
  had been the victim of a fraud and claiming further, the next day, that she 
  had signed under duress.</p>
<p> [5] In his reasons on the motion to enforce the Minutes of Settlement, the 
  trial judge referred to certain evidence: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The appellant had no independent legal advice before signing the guarantee;</li>
  <li>Her signature had been forged on a statement of affairs forming part of 
    the documents, but there was no evidence that the signature on her guarantee 
    was not genuine;</li>
  <li>Although moderately fluent in English, the appellant had the benefit of 
    an interpreter(s) in the Russian language. In addition, with her were a paralegal 
    and her former husband, who were present at all times during the negotiations 
    and the signing of the Minutes of Settlement;</li>
  <li>The Bank's lawyer proposed a settlement of $58,000.00. The paralegal, who 
    was retained by her former husband but who the appellant denies was her agent, 
    counter-offered $52,000.00;</li>
  <li>The Minutes of Settlement were handwritten by the Bank's lawyer;</li>
  <li>The Bank's lawyer left the room, leaving the appellant alone with her former 
    husband, the paralegal and the interpreter(s). The interpreter(s) translated 
    the document for the appellant; and</li>
  <li>After the Minutes of Settlement were signed, the paralegal informed the 
    Bank's counsel that he and the interpreter(s) were being accused of fraud. 
    The appellant was claiming that they had improperly translated the Minutes 
    of Settlement. She wanted the settlement to be amended to include that she 
    had been a victim of fraud. The next day, she wrote to counsel claiming, amongst 
    other things, that she had signed under duress, was a victim of fraud and 
    had no independent legal advice.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [6] The motions judge then made two statements contained in paras. 16 and 20 
  of his reasons: </p>
<p class="indent"> [16] It is reasonable to assume that many matters were discussed 
  in the course of the settlement discussions, including the [Bank's] intent to 
  pursue its claim, the merits of [the appellant's] defences, the cost of defending 
  the claim, the cost to her if her defences were unsuccessful following a trial 
  and the manner in which the [Bank] could enforce a judgment. She was clearly 
  aware of most of these issues before these discussions, based on her prior correspondence 
  with [the Bank] and its lawyer.</p>
<p class="indent">[20] If this case had proceeded, it would have turned on the 
  [Bank's] obligation in the circumstances to provide independent legal advice 
  and the credibility of [the appellant]. In my view of the drastic consequences 
  to the [appellant] if this case proceeded to trial and she lost, the settlement 
  could clearly be for her benefit. The settlement also reduced the [Bank's] entitlement 
  and delayed enforcement of the writ for a sufficient time to allow her to arrange 
  financing of the payment of the liability or arrange a sale of her house and 
  other housing accommodation.</p>
<p>
  [7] There was no proper basis to support the assumption of the motions judge 
  in the first paragraph. Clearly, the matters enumerated by the motions judge 
  are matters that would be discussed with an independent lawyer, but they are 
  not matters that would necessarily be discussed with two translators, a paralegal 
  and a former husband. The Bank took the position that the appellant had the 
  benefit of these discussions, and the motions judge seemed to accept the Bank's 
  position. In any event, these discussions cannot equate to independent legal 
  advice.</p>
<p>
  [8] The conduct of the appellant in this action is suspect. She appears to have 
  alleged misconduct against all those involved in this action. However, there 
  is a conflict in the evidence as to what happened at the relevant time surrounding 
  the execution of the Minutes of Settlement. The question is not, as stated by 
  the motions judge in the first paragraph quoted above, whether the appellant 
  was aware of the issues, or whether she knew what she was doing, but what transpired 
  to produce her signature. The allegation of undue influence or, more accurately, 
  economic duress does have some substance. The conflict in the evidence cannot 
  be resolved on paper and economic duress remains an issue. </p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant had always claimed that she was the victim of a fraud. Her 
  signature on the Personal Financial Information had been forged. She also raised, 
  as a defence, the lack of independent legal advice. At a minimum, in these circumstances, 
  it would have been prudent to direct her to get independent legal advice before 
  the execution of the Minutes of Settlement.</p>
<p>
  [10] The motions judge recognized that the case would turn on the issue of independent 
  legal advice and the credibility of the appellant. He did not address either 
  of these issues. He also seemed to be of the view that the settlement could 
  &quot;clearly be for her benefit&quot;. This conclusion is questionable. The 
  settlement reduced the amount of the debt and delayed the enforcement of writs 
  of execution, but the amount was still substantial and the appellant's fear 
  that she would lose her house remained very real.</p>
<p>
  [11] Under rule 49.09, the court has a discretion to grant judgment in the terms 
  of the accepted offer or direct that the proceedings continue as if there had 
  been no accepted offer to settle: see Milios v. Zagas (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 218 
  (C.A.). The appellant did not request the motions judge to direct that the proceedings 
  continue. However, the rule does not seem to require that a party request the 
  court to send the matter to trial. It was an alternative that was open and not 
  considered by the motions judge. It should also be noted that the appellant 
  was self-represented. </p>
<p>
  [12] There are troubling aspects to the evidence in this case and, in the words 
  of this court in Fox Estate v. Stelmaszyk (2003), 173 O.A.C. 378, it does not 
  satisfy our sense of justice to enforce the settlement in those circumstances. 
  We conclude that we should exercise the discretion under rule 49.09 and direct 
  that the proceeding continue as if there had been no accepted offer to settle.</p>
<p>
  [13] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The parties have not had an opportunity 
  to make submissions on the costs of the appeal and the costs below do not appear 
  to have been dealt with. In the absence of submissions, we would be disposed 
  to order costs, for both the appeal and the motion below, in the amount of $2,500.00 
  to follow the event of the action. If the parties wish a different disposition 
  of the costs, they may make submissions, in writing, within fourteen days.</p>

  "I agree K. M. Weiler J.A.&quot;</p>

<p>
  DOHERTY J.A. (dissenting)</p>
<p>
  [14] I would dismiss the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [15] This court does not address the matter de novo. It can interfere only if 
  it is established Cameron J. felt into reversible error. If this court finds 
  reversible error, then it may exercise the discretion implicit in rule 49.09 
  in determining the appropriate order: Fox Estates v. Stelmaszyk (2003), 173 
  O.A.C. 378 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [16] This court cannot substitute its own &quot;sense of justice&quot; for that 
  of the motion judge. The limitation on appellate review is no mere formalism 
  or rule of expediency to be applied when and if the court deems it appropriate. 
  The limitations on appellate review recognize that this court's &quot;sense 
  of justice&quot; is no keener than that of the court from which the appeal is 
  taken. While a second analysis, free from any restraint, may yield a different 
  result from that reached at the first instance, there is no reason to think 
  that it will achieve a more just result.</p>
<p>
  [17] Nor is the scope of appellate review altered by the appellant's decision 
  to represent herself. It is noteworthy that the appellant has had and fired 
  at least three lawyers in the course of these proceedings, including one whom 
  she fired on the morning of the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [18] My colleagues identified one error said to have been made by Cameron J. 
  They conclude that there was no evidence to support his statements in paragraph 
  16 of his reasons. </p>
<p>
  [16] It is reasonable to assume that many matters were discussed in the course 
  of the settlement discussions, including the [Bank's] intent to pursue its claim, 
  the merits of [the appellant's] defences, the cost of defending the claim, the 
  cost to her if her defences were unsuccessful following a trial and the manner 
  in which the [Bank] could enforce a judgment. She was clearly aware of most 
  of these issues before these discussions, based on her prior correspondence 
  with [the Bank] and its lawyer.</p>
<p>
  [19] I read this passage differently than my colleagues. I think Cameron J. 
  was simply acknowledging that he was prepared to accept that many of the matters 
  that the appellant said were discussed, were in fact discussed. For example, 
  she claimed that the Bank insisted that it would pursue its claim, that her 
  defence had no merit, and that she would lose her house. These are the matters 
  referred to by Cameron J. in paragraph 16.</p>
<p>
  [20] Cameron J.'s decision must be assessed in the context of the material put 
  before him and the arguments made to him. The appellant contended that she had 
  not entered into a settlement agreement. She relied on duress, and more specifically, 
  economic duress, to negate the apparent agreement. The appellant did not take 
  the position that although she had entered into a settlement agreement, Cameron 
  J. should exercise his discretion under s. 49.09 and decline to enforce the 
  settlement by way of a judgment. Given the arguments that were put before Cameron 
  J. (and renewed in written materials before this court), he properly identified 
  the approach to be taken to r. 49.09 in para. 17: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This court should exercise its discretion under rule 49.09 to uphold settlement 
  agreements unless the resiling party can establish duress or non est factum 
  or other factors which do not apply in this case such as fraud or mistaken instruction.</p>
<p>
  [21] Cameron J. reviewed the background to the motion and then identified the 
  approach to claims of economic duress taken by this court's judgment in Stott 
  v. Merit Investment Corp. (1988), 48 D.L.R. (4th) 288. Having accurately identified 
  the legal principle, Cameron J. went on to reject certain statements made to 
  him in the course of argument by the appellant and to observe that the settlement 
  provided some benefit to the appellant. He then said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am not persuaded that the duress alleged by Mrs. Matutschovsky existed to 
  the point of coercion of her will where she was pressed into such a position 
  that she had no realistic alternative.</p>
<p>
  [22] In my view, there was no error in the application of the governing legal 
  principle to the allegations of the appellant. It was open to Cameron J. to 
  come to this assessment, and absent any error in law or palpable and overriding 
  factual error this court cannot interfere.</p>
<p>
  [23] I would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondent in the amount of 
  $3,000. </p>
