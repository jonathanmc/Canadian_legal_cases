<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Romain W.M. Pitt of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated December 17, 2001.</p>
<p>SHARPE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The respondent plaintiff was persuaded by the appellant Igor Ilitchev to 
  invest money in the shares of Thermal Conversion Ltd. (&quot;Thermal&quot;). 
  Ilitchev presented Thermal as a successful company planning an initial public 
  offering. Thermal did not exist, there was no initial public offering, and the 
  respondent's money, which he paid to Northwest Financial &amp; Investment Corporation 
  (Canada) (&quot;Northwest&quot;), was lost. Igor Ilitchev is the President and 
  director of Northwest. Igor Ilitchev blames others for the Thermal fraud and 
  says that he too was a victim, but he failed to satisfy undertakings given on 
  cross-examination to produce documents that would support his defence. The respondent 
  also claims payment of two loans to Igor Ilitchev, one for $ 7,500 (Cdn) and 
  the other for $ 7, 500 (U.S.).</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent also alleges that Marina Ilitchev, Igor's wife, is liable 
  for the alleged fraud as a principal officer and directing mind of Northwest, 
  but offered scant evidence of her actual involvement in the company and no evidence 
  of her involvement in the fraud. Marina Ilitchev did not file an affidavit to 
  deny the respondent's allegations. </p>
<p>
  [3] Pitt J. granted the respondent's motion for summary judgment against both 
  Igor and Marina Ilitchev, as well as against Northwest. Igor and Marina Ilitchev 
  appeal, arguing that the respondent failed to meet the test for summary judgment. 
  For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the motions judge properly granted 
  summary judgment against Igor Ilitchev for $145,000 paid by the respondent for 
  the Thermal shares, but that the motions judge erred in granting summary judgment 
  for that amount against Marina Ilitchev and against Igor Ilitchev for the amount 
  of the alleged loans.</p>
<p>
  1. Claims against Igor Ilitchev</p>
<p>
  (a) Thermal shares </p>
<p>
  [4] The respondent filed extensive affidavit evidence setting out in considerable 
  detail his case against Igor Ilitchev. Ilitchev presented himself to the respondent 
  and to other affiants as a financial advisor and stock promoter engaged in various 
  business ventures. Between August and October 2000, Ilitchev persuaded the respondent 
  to invest in the shares of Thermal, a company said by Ilitchev to be producing 
  energy efficient engines. He told the respondent that Thermal was doing well 
  financially, that it was planning an initial public offering, and that it presented 
  a very attractive and profitable investment opportunity. Similar representations 
  were made to other potential investors. None of Ilitchev's representations were 
  true. Thermal did not exist and there was no initial public offering. The respondent 
  swears that he made several advances to Ilitchev totalling $145,000 to purchase 
  Thermal shares. These advances are supported by promissory notes, executed by 
  Ilitchev on behalf of Northwest and, as the notes state, on behalf of &quot;Mr. 
  Igor Ilitchev personally (by own Canadian assets)&#133;&quot;</p>
<p>
  [5] In his responding affidavits, Ilitchev admitted that the respondent had 
  advanced $115,000 to Northwest, but denied that the respondent made the final 
  advance of $30,000. Ilitchev denied any personal liability on the ground that 
  he was the victim, not the perpetrator of a fraud committed by another corporate 
  entity and stated that he himself had invested and lost $100,000 in Thermal 
  shares. Ilitchev asserts that his liability on the promissory notes was limited 
  to his personal interest in Northwest, an assertion denied by the respondent 
  and difficult to reconcile with the written terms of the notes. Ilitchev was 
  extensively cross-examined on these assertions. Among the many gaps, inconsistencies 
  and contradictions in Ilitchev's evidence are the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) He failed to satisfy a long list of specific undertakings 
  to produce documents that would support his bald assertions. Most significant 
  was his failure to provide any financial records from Northwest to support his 
  assertion that he too was a victim of the fraud and had lost $100,000. </p>
<p class="indent">(b) He never provided the respondent or any of the other investors 
  with a prospectus for Thermal, although he suggested that one existed.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) He could provide no details about Thermal, whether it was 
  a Canadian or American company, its stock ticker symbol, or who was its underwriter.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) He gave far-fetched accounts of his own educational background.</p>
<p class="indent">(e) His evidence that the respondent failed to advance the final 
  $30,000 was contradicted by documentary evidence including the promissory note 
  he signed, and his failure to demand its return or destruction.</p>
<p class="indent">(f) When pressed for details about Thermal by a skeptical potential 
  investor, he stated that there were no more shares available, but two weeks 
  later, he tried to sell shares to another individual. </p>
<p>
  [6] In his brief endorsement, the motions judge found: </p>
<p class="indent">
  With respect to the liability of Igor Ilitchev and the corporate defendant there 
  is not even a resemblance of a genuine issue for trial. It seems clear that 
  the corporate defendant was used as an instrument of fraud in order to induce 
  the plaintiff to invest in a non-existent company. Even if there was no fraud 
  (which is unlikely) the defendants' actions were grossly negligent and reckless 
  and were the direct cause of the plaintiff's loss. </p>
<p>
  [7] The appellants rely on the well established rule that on a motion for summary 
  judgment, the judge cannot assess credibility, weigh evidence or find facts. 
  Rather, the judge is limited to assessing the threshold issue of whether there 
  is a genuine issue for trial: see Auguonie v. Galion Solid Waste Material Inc. 
  (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.). The appellants submit that, in view of Ilitchev's 
  sworn denials of the respondent's allegations, there is a genuine issue for 
  trial issue and that summary judgment should have been refused. </p>
<p>
  [8] In my view, the motions judge did not err in granting summary judgment against 
  Igor Ilitchev and Northwest. On this record, it was open to the motions judge 
  to find that there was no genuine issue for trial. While a judge must avoid 
  making findings on contested factual issues on a summary judgment motion, a 
  judge is also required to assess the record with a view to determining whether 
  there is a genuine issue of disputed facts. Self-serving affidavits that merely 
  assert defences without providing some detail or supporting evidence are not 
  sufficient to create a genuine issue for trial: Guarantee Co. of North America 
  v. Gordon Capital Corp., [1999] 3 S.C.R. 423 at para. 31. As stated by Borins 
  J. (as he then was) in Rogers Cable TV Ltd. v. 373041 Ontario Ltd. (1994), 22 
  O.R. (3d) 25 (Gen. Div.) at 28 &quot;The requirement that the parties put their 
  'best foot forward' goes together with the requirement that the motions judge 
  'take a hard look at the merits of the action at this preliminary stage' to 
  determine whether the moving party has succeeded in establishing that there 
  is no genuine issue for trial.&quot; Borins J. added, at 28-29: </p>
<p class="indent">
  What the defendant's position amounts to is this - a genuine issue for trial 
  is raised in every case in which a defendant swears that it does not owe a debt, 
  notwithstanding overwhelming evidence to the contrary presented by the plaintiff, 
  and in the absence of any additional evidence by the defendant to support its 
  denial. Although in one sense an issue of credibility is raised on the assumption 
  that a trial judge may believe the defendant, in my view in the context of the 
  record in this case this does not constitute a genuine issue for trial&#133;(emphasis 
  in original)</p>
<p>
  [9] In the present case, the failure of Ilitchev to satisfy undertakings to 
  provide the documentary evidence that would support his assertion that he was 
  the victim, not the perpetrator of the fraud, are particularly telling. One 
  is left with Ilitchev's bald assertion of facts that he himself said could be 
  supported when the relevant documents were produced. The documentary evidence 
  that has been filed, including the promissory notes signed by Ilitchev in his 
  personal capacity, supports the respondent's version. This evidence, combined 
  with the startling inconsistencies and implausible elements in Ilitchev's evidence 
  and his failure to provide any support for his defence, brings this case within 
  the same category as Royal Bank of Canada v. Feldman (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 798 
  at 800 (Gen. Div.) appeal quashed 27 O.R. (3d) 322 (C.A.) where it was held 
  that &quot;&#133;considered in the context of all the evidence, the defendant's 
  evidence is so disingenuous as not to constitute a genuine issue for trial.&quot; 
  See also 1061590 Ontario Ltd. v. Ontario Jockey Club (1995), 21 O.R. (3d) 547 
  at 557 (C.A.); Blackburn v. Lapkin (1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 292 at 313 (Gen. Div.); 
  Transamerica Life Insurance Co. of Canada v. Canada Life Assurance Co. (1996), 
  28 O.R. 423 at 434-435 (Gen. Div.), affd [1997] O.J. No. 3754 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  (b) Other loans</p>
<p>
  [10] The respondent also claims the amount of two loans, one for $7,500 (Cdn) 
  and one for $7,500 (U.S.). The evidence as to these loans is conflicting. The 
  respondent insists that they were personal loans to Igor Ilitchev to assist 
  a friend in Russia. Ilitchev denies that and also denies that the respondent 
  advanced any money on these loans. He relies on the fact that the promissory 
  notes securing the loans were executed on behalf of Northwest only and not on 
  his own behalf. He says that the promissory notes were intended to secure a 
  finders fee for the respondent's introduction of certain other investors to 
  Northwest. Liability of Northwest on the promissory notes is not disputed. </p>
<p>
  [11] The motions judge did not deal with these loans or notes as items separate 
  and distinct from the Thermal transaction. </p>
<p>
  [12] In the face of this conflicting evidence and in view of the fact that the 
  notes were executed only on behalf of Northwest, not on behalf of Ilitchev personally, 
  it is my view that there is a genuine issue for trial and that the motions judge 
  erred in granting summary judgment against Igor Ilitchev and Marina Ilitchev 
  for the amount of these notes.</p>
<p>
  2. Claims Against Marina Ilitchev</p>
<p>
  [13] The respondent's summary judgment motion against Marina Ilitchev was supported 
  by very little evidence. The respondent swore that he saw a business card naming 
  Marina as on officer of Northwest and there is evidence she signed a personal 
  guarantee for the investment of another investor. However, the respondent had 
  no dealings with Marina Ilitchev. He adduced no evidence of any wrongdoing by 
  her personally, and no evidence linking her with the wrongful conduct of Igor 
  Ilitchev. The respondent's case against Marina Ilitchev essentially rested on 
  her failure to provide any evidence denying her personal knowledge of or complicity 
  in Igor Ilitchev's fraudulent scheme. </p>
<p>
  [14] The motions judge recognized that the case against her was &quot;not as 
  crystal clear as that of Igor&quot; but concluded as follows: &quot;Her failure 
  to put her best foot forward as a party by denying in an affidavit the allegation 
  that she was a director in a company that was used as an instrument of fraud 
  and or recklessly to cause loss to the plaintiff renders her position no more 
  defensible than that of Igor.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [15] In my respectful view, the motions judge erred in law in reaching this 
  conclusion. There was hardly enough evidence to conclude that she was a director 
  of the Northwest and, in any event, merely being the director of a company used 
  as an instrument of fraud, without more, is not sufficient to support personal 
  liability: see ScotiaMcLeod Inc. v. Peoples Jewellers Ltd. (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 
  481 (C.A.). In my opinion, the evidence adduced by the respondent on the summary 
  judgment motion failed to establish a prima facie case for the personal liability 
  of Marina Ilitchev. While a party faced with a motion for summary judgment is 
  required to put his or her &quot;best foot forward,&quot; there must be a case 
  to answer. In my view, as the respondent failed to present evidence that could 
  support a judgment against Marina Ilitchev, her failure to respond provides 
  no basis upon which an inference of liability could properly be drawn. Thus, 
  the motions judge erred in law in granting summary judgment against her. </p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [16] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal in part and vary the judgment 
  by amending Paragraph 2 to provide that both Northwest and Igor Ilitchev are 
  liable for $145,000, and that Northwest Financial &amp; Investment Corporation 
  is also liable for $19,000. Paragraph 3 of the judgment should be amended to 
  provide that the costs order is against Northwest and Igor Ilitchev. The motion 
  for summary judgment against Marina Ilitchev should be dismissed, but in the 
  circumstances of this case and as all parties were represented by the same counsel, 
  I would not alter the motions judge's costs order.</p>
<p>
  [17] As all appellants were represented by the same counsel and given the divided 
  success on this appeal, it is my view that the parties should bear their own 
  costs of this appeal.</p>
