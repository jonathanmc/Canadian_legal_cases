<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Ducharme J. made two important findings of fact. First, when the appellant 
  executed the October 2000 document, she intended to release her mother's estate. 
  Second, Ducharme J. found that the respondent, who was not cross-examined on 
  her affidavit, &quot;engaged in no improper or unlawful purpose in the exercise 
  of her duties as estate trustee&quot;.</p>
<p>[2] There was ample evidence to support each of those findings of fact. There 
  is no dispute that the appellant had the relevant estate records at the time 
  she signed the October 2000 documents and she made no objection until over a 
  year later.</p>
<p>[3] The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.</p>
<p>[4] Costs to the respondent are fixed in the amount of $3,500, inclusive of 
  GST and disbursements.</p>
