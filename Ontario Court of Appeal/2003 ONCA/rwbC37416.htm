<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice R. Haines for the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated November 30, 2001 and the sentence dated February 28, 
  2002.</p>

<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The trial judge emphasized throughout his reasons that the onus rested 
  upon the Crown to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. 
  In considering the guilt or innocence of the appellant, he stated that:</p>
<p>The court should proceed with caution in assessing testimony about distant 
  events and approach the evidence with healthy skepticism.</p>
<p>[2] In our view, there is no obligation on the trial judge to deal with each 
  and every inconsistency. It is not necessary that the evidence be microscopically 
  analyzed.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant&#146;s counsel emphasized the fact that the trial judge did 
  not give sufficient consideration to the emphatic denials by both the complainant 
  and the appellant during the period of time that the alleged sexual assaults 
  occurred.</p>
<p>[4] In our opinion, the trial judge gave adequate consideration to the submissions 
  of the highly experienced trial counsel in relation to both the absence of detail 
  in relation to the circumstances surrounding the assaults and the vehement denials 
  of both the complainant and the appellant.</p>
<p>[5] The evidence adduced at trial took place between 13 and 17 years before 
  the trial. In our view, it is not surprising that the complainant would be vague 
  about many of the surrounding circumstances.</p>
<p>[6] With respect to the complainant&#146;s denials of the activities, by the 
  time that the complainant was first confronted with the activities between him 
  and the appellant, the appellant was well aware that others would view those 
  activities as wrong and that he would be considered to be gay which he was not 
  prepared to accept.</p>
<p>[7] In R. v. Sheppard (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 298 at 320 and R. v. Branch (2002) 
  162 C.C.C. (3d), the Supreme Court of Canada provides some guidance as to how 
  complaints of insufficiency of reasons should be assessed:</p>
<p class="indent">A trial judge&#146;s duty is satisfied by reasons which are 
  sufficient to serve the purpose for which the duty is imposed, i.e. a decision 
  which having regard to the particular circumstances of the case is reasonably 
  intelligible to the parties and provides the basis for meaningful appellate 
  review of the correctness of the trial judge&#146;s decision.</p>
<p>[8] In our opinion, the reasons given by the trial judge are considered, intelligible 
  and responsive to the issues raised in the trial.</p>
<p>[9] The role of a trial judge as a listener and observer of the evidence cannot 
  be overstated. The trial judge is in the best position to make findings with 
  respect to the credibility and reliability of the witness and therefore appellate 
  courts must be deferential to the assessment of credibility made at trial.</p>
<p>[10] It is therefore our conclusion that the appeal as to conviction must be 
  dismissed.</p>
<p>[11] With respect to the sentence imposed by the trial judge, we do not find 
  that the trial judge committed any error in principle in declining to impose 
  a conditional sentence. We are of the view that conditional sentences should 
  be rarely imposed in cases of sexual touching of children by adults, particularly 
  when the conduct is repeated over a number of years and where the sexual violation 
  is of a vulnerable person by a person in a position of trust.</p>
<p>[12] Leave to appeal sentence is allowed but the appeal as against sentence 
  is dismissed.</p>
