<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Victor Paisley of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated October 12, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant law firm appeals from the order of Paisley J. on three grounds.</p>
<p>
  [2] First, the appellant asserts that the motion judge erred by ordering that 
  all of the law firm's accounts to the respondent be assessed.</p>
<p>
  [3] We agree. The accounts rendered to the respondent between 1993 and 1995 
  were all paid, without objection. They related to the accident benefits component 
  of the respondent's claims. The motion judge did not consider, and we cannot 
  see, any &quot;special circumstances&quot; (Solicitor Act, s. 4(1)) that would 
  entitle the respondent to have these accounts assessed more than six years after 
  they were rendered, accepted and paid. Of course, the assessment of the account 
  relating to the motor vehicle action rendered on September 11, 2000 should proceed, 
  as ordered by the motion judge.</p>
<p>
  [4] Second, the appellant submits that the motion judge erred by not imposing 
  a solicitor's lien on the personal loan the solicitor made to the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [5] We disagree. A charging order pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Solicitor's Act 
  must be made in relation to legal services provided by a solicitor, not personal 
  loans made to clients.</p>
<p>
  [6] Third, the appellant contends that the motion judge erred by awarding the 
  respondent costs of $2500 on a solicitor and client basis.</p>
<p>
  [7] We disagree. Costs are discretionary and we see no basis for interfering 
  with the motion judge's exercise of discretion with respect to the scale and 
  quantum of costs. The fact that the appellant has been successful on one ground 
  of appeal does not alter our conclusion that the motion judge's costs award 
  should be affirmed.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appeal is allowed on the assessment of costs issue and dismissed on 
  the other issues. Each party should bear its own costs of the appeal.</p>
