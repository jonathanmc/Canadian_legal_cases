<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Robert F. Scott, sitting as a summary 
  conviction appeal judge, dated November 19, 2001, dismissing an appeal from 
  the acquittals entered by Justice Donald J. Halikowski on September 14, 2000.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.:</p>
<p>
  A. OVERVIEW</p>
<p>
  [1] In the middle of the night, the police received a 911 call from a distraught 
  woman. When they met her, the young woman said that her boyfriend had assaulted 
  her and made threats concerning her dog and her personal property. She informed 
  the police that she had been living at her boyfriend's house and that she had 
  moved in some furniture and other personal belongings. She was very emotional 
  and adamant about returning to the boyfriend's house to retrieve her belongings.</p>
<p>
  [2] The police officers believed that it was their duty to accompany the young 
  woman to the boyfriend's house in order to keep the peace, investigate her allegations, 
  and assist her in retrieving her property.</p>
<p>
  [3] At the boyfriend's house, the young woman used a key to let herself and 
  the police inside. Once inside, the police met the boyfriend who was standing 
  in the doorway of the bedroom. The police told him that they were there to keep 
  the peace while the young woman gathered her belongings and then they were going 
  to leave. They also informed the boyfriend that they were there to investigate 
  allegations of assault, threatening, and unlawful entry arising out of a confrontation 
  between the couple earlier in the evening. The police gave the boyfriend the 
  option of coming with them to the police station for questioning; otherwise, 
  they would obtain a warrant for his arrest. The boyfriend told the police to 
  get a warrant and he ordered them to leave the house.</p>
<p>
  [4] The young woman wanted to get some of her belongings from the bedroom. The 
  boyfriend remained standing in the doorway of the bedroom. The police asked 
  him a number of times to move aside. He refused. The police officers arrested 
  him for obstructing a peace officer. The boyfriend resisted arrest. A scuffle 
  ensued. The police used pepper spray to subdue the boyfriend. He was then also 
  charged with assault resist arrest.</p>
<p>
  [5] At trial, the boyfriend was convicted of a number of offences relating to 
  the altercation with his girlfriend earlier in the evening. However, the trial 
  judge acquitted him of the offences of obstructing a peace officer and assault 
  resist arrest on the basis that, once the police officers decided not to arrest 
  the boyfriend upon their arrival at his house, they &quot;ought to have left 
  the residence . . . and pursued alternate remedies to protect the property of 
  the alleged victim.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [6] The Crown appealed. The summary conviction appeal judge dismissed the appeal, 
  concluding that the police &quot;should have exercised better judgment in this 
  matter, there being no ongoing or continuing exigent circumstances following 
  their lawful entry.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [7] The Crown appeals again. The appeal raises important issues relating to 
  the authority of police officers to enter, and take actions inside, a dwelling 
  house pursuant to their common law and statutory duties to preserve the peace 
  and protect property.</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  (1) The parties and the events</p>
<p>
  [8] On the evening of March 29, 2000, the complainant, Karen MacLaurin, watched 
  the hockey game on television with her boyfriend, David Sanderson, and Sanderson's 
  friends, April Farrell and Scott Menzies. Throughout the evening and after the 
  friends' departure, MacLaurin and Sanderson argued about MacLaurin's dog. After 
  MacLaurin had gone to bed, she heard Sanderson threaten to kill the dog. He 
  got a hammer and chased the dog. MacLaurin tried to restrain Sanderson. He pushed 
  her to the floor. She ran, shoeless and in her pyjamas, to Farrell's and Menzies' 
  nearby apartment.</p>
<p>
  [9] Farrell accompanied MacLaurin back to Sanderson's house to get the dog and 
  MacLaurin's personal belongings. The altercation between MacLaurin and Sanderson 
  re ignited. Sanderson assaulted MacLaurin.</p>
<p>
  [10] MacLaurin and Farrell returned to Farrell's apartment. Sanderson followed 
  them. MacLaurin may have threatened to damage Sanderson's car if he hurt her 
  dog. Sanderson threatened to burn MacLaurin's property.</p>
<p>
  [11] Sanderson returned to his house. Menzies called 911. MacLaurin spoke to 
  the police. Four officers (two regular and two trainees) arrived and decided 
  to accompany MacLaurin to Sanderson's house to allow her to get her belongings 
  safely (she had clothes, cosmetics and furniture in the house).</p>
<p>
  [12] At Sanderson's house, MacLaurin used a key to gain entry. Once inside, 
  the police gave Sanderson the option of voluntarily accompanying them to the 
  station for questioning, or waiting until they obtained a warrant to arrest 
  him for assaulting MacLaurin. Sanderson told the officers to get a warrant, 
  and he was not arrested at that juncture. Sanderson swore at the police and 
  repeatedly told them to leave his house. Constable Richard Paul replied that 
  they would leave as soon as MacLaurin had collected her belongings.</p>
<p>
  [13] MacLaurin wanted to enter the bedroom to collect her clothes. Sanderson 
  blocked her entry. Constable Paul asked him to move. Sanderson refused. Constable 
  Paul told him that he would be arrested for obstructing a police officer if 
  he persisted. Sanderson still did not move. Constable Paul arrested him and 
  reached to take him by the shoulder. Sanderson resisted and a struggle ensued. 
  The police used pepper spray to subdue him.</p>
<p>
  (2) The criminal charges, trial and first appeal</p>
<p>
  [14] Sanderson was charged with six offences - uttering a threat to kill an 
  animal, assault, unlawful entry to a dwelling house (the Farrell and Menzies 
  apartment), uttering a threat to damage property, obstructing a peace officer, 
  and assault resist arrest. The Crown elected to proceed summarily.</p>
<p>
  [15] The trial judge, Justice Donald J. Halikowski, convicted Sanderson of uttering 
  a threat to kill an animal, assault, and uttering a threat to damage property. 
  He acquitted Sanderson of unlawful entry to a dwelling house. No appeal was 
  taken with respect to these verdicts.</p>
<p>
  [16] The trial judge also acquitted Sanderson of obstructing a peace officer 
  and assault resist arrest. He reasoned:</p>
<p class="indent"> The officers only reason for being at the residence was to 
  investigate the domestic assault complained of by Ms. MacLaurin and to protect 
  her property from destruction.</p>
<p class="indent"> Having decided to give the accused the option of accompanying 
  them to the station in relation to a domestic assault investigation or be subject 
  to an arrest warrant, their next logical state would have been to protect her 
  property by allowing Ms. MacLaurin access to the bedroom to retrieve it. The 
  accused will be found to have been ordered to step aside by the officers for 
  that purpose.</p>
<p class="indent"> However, that finding does not enure to the benefit of the 
  Crown on the obstruct and the assault police charges. The authority of the officers 
  to order the accused to move from the doorway is rather tenuous. They did not 
  arrest the accused prior to issuing that order. They may well have had reasonable 
  and probable grounds to believe that he had committed an assault on her or threatened 
  her, but they chose not to arrest him on those charges.</p>
<p class="indent"> In fact, their offering him an option to wait to be arrested 
  on a warrant betrays their belief that a further assault, destruction of property, 
  or breach of the peace was imminent. The officers ought to have left the residence 
  at that time and pursued alternate remedies to protect the property of the alleged 
  victim. The accused had every right to demand that they remove themselves from 
  his home unless they were prepared to arrest him for an offence, and the officers 
  were not so inclined. On that basis, the obstruct police and assault resist 
  arrest charges will be dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [17] The Crown appealed these acquittals. The summary conviction appeal judge, 
  Justice Robert F. Scott, dismissed the appeal in brief oral reasons:</p>
<p class="indent"> Appeal dismissed. The police in this case, having determined 
  that neither the property nor the Respondent's girlfriend were in any danger, 
  escalated the situation by attempting to move the Respondent having first determined 
  that they had no authority to arrest the Respondent upon first entry into the 
  home of the Respondent. The police should have exercised better judgment in 
  this matter, there being no ongoing or continuing exigent circumstances following 
  their lawful entry.</p>
<p>
  [18] The Crown appeals from the judgment of the summary conviction appeal judge.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [19] The appeal raises two issues:</p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Was the police entry into the respondent's house lawful?<br>
  (2) If the answer to (1) is 'Yes', was the police conduct inside the house lawful?</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) Lawful entry into residence?</p>
<p>
  [20] The summary conviction appeal judge explicitly held that the police entry 
  into Sanderson's residence was lawful; however, he gave no reasons in support 
  of this conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [21] The trial judge also appears to have held, albeit not explicitly, that 
  the initial police entry was lawful. It appears from his reasons that he regarded 
  the entry as lawful on two grounds - &quot;to investigate the domestic assault 
  complained of by Ms. MacLaurin and to protect her property from destruction.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [22] The Crown agrees with these conclusions. However, the respondent does not. 
  He contends that the police had no authority to enter his residence. Hence, 
  it is necessary to address this preliminary issue.</p>
<p>
  [23] The Crown submits that the police officers had authority to enter the respondent's 
  residence on two bases: (1) the complainant, as an occupier, had invited the 
  officers into the residence in order to assist her; and (2) the officers had 
  the authority to enter the home in order to discharge their common law and statutory 
  duties to preserve the peace and protect property.</p>
<p>
  [24] The respondent disputes the Crown's assertion that the complainant was 
  an occupant, and submits that she was only a guest. He points to the complainant's 
  testimony in cross-examination that she was &quot;staying&quot; with the respondent, 
  but not &quot;living&quot; with the respondent, and that she had not yet officially 
  moved into the respondent's residence. The trial judge made no explicit finding 
  on this issue. However, implicit in his reasons is a finding that the complainant 
  did not have the authority to consent to the police officers' entry into the 
  respondent's home. I would not interfere with that finding.</p>
<p>
  [25] In my view, the police officers had the authority to enter the home in 
  order to discharge their common law and statutory duties to preserve the peace 
  and protect property.</p>
<p>
  [26] The powers and duties of a peace officer emanate from common law and statute. 
  The general duty of a peace officer is to preserve the peace as it relates to 
  the protection of life and property: see R. v. Stenning, [1970] S.C.R. 631 and 
  R. v. Dedman, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2. In Ontario, these common law duties have been 
  codified in ss. 42(1) and (3) of the Police Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15.</p>
<p>
  [27] In R. v. Feeney, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13, the Supreme Court of Canada enunciated 
  the general rule that warrantless arrests in private dwellings are prohibited 
  by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </p>
<p>
  [28] In R. v. Godoy, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 311, the Supreme Court of Canada held that 
  the common law and statutory duties of police officers may, in some circumstances, 
  empower them to enter a dwelling without a warrant. Lamer C.J.C. stated explicitly 
  that Feeney applied only to arrest situations (p. 326):</p>
<p class="indent"> I emphasize that Feeney was concerned solely with when the 
  police can enter a dwelling without a warrant to make an arrest. Thus, in my 
  view, the reasoning in Feeney does not apply to the case at bar, which is unconcerned 
  with powers of arrest.</p>
<p>
  [29] Lamer C.J.C. was of the view that the question of police entry into a dwelling 
  house for investigatory purposes needed to be determined &quot;on the circumstances 
  of each case&quot; (at p. 318) and in accordance with the general principles 
  for evaluating the common law powers and duties of police officers as set out 
  in the leading English case, R. v. Waterfield, [1963] 3 All E.R. 659 (C.C.A). 
  Lamer C.J.C. said, at pp. 318-19:</p>
<p class="indent"> The accepted test for evaluating the common law powers and 
  duties of the police was set out in Waterfield, supra (followed by this Court 
  in R. v. Stenning . . ., Knowlton v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 443, and Dedman 
  v. The Queen . . .). If police conduct constitutes a prima facie interference 
  with a person's liberty or property, the court must consider two questions: 
  first, does the conduct fall within the general scope of any duty imposed by 
  statute or recognized at common law; and second, does the conduct, albeit within 
  the general scope of such a duty, involve an unjustifiable use of powers associated 
  with the duty.</p>
<p>
  [30] In Dedman, supra, and in R. v. Simpson (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 482 (Ont. 
  C.A.), the Supreme Court of Canada and this court provided guidance in applying 
  the Waterfield analysis to the Canadian context.</p>
<p>
  [31] In Dedman, LeDain J. said that, in order for a police power to be justifiable 
  in a given context, &quot;[t]he interference with liberty must be necessary 
  for the carrying out of the particular police duty and it must be reasonable, 
  having regard to the nature of the liberty interfered with and the importance 
  of the public purpose served by the interference&quot; (at p. 35).</p>
<p>
  [32] In Simpson, Doherty J.A. stated, at p. 499:</p>
<p class="indent"> [T]he justifiability of an officer's conduct depends on a number 
  of factors including the duty being performed, the extent to which some interference 
  with individual liberty is necessitated in order to perform that duty, the importance 
  of the performance of that duty to the public good, the liberty interfered with, 
  and the nature and extent of the interference.</p>
<p>
  [33] In my view, the police officers' entry into the respondent's residence 
  complied with the general Waterfield test and with the overlay of factors for 
  applying it in the Canadian context as articulated in Dedman and Simpson. The 
  officers were faced with a distraught woman in the middle of the night. She, 
  and an independent witness, reported that she had been assaulted by the respondent. 
  She had left the residence in only her pyjamas and without footwear - on March 
  29. The altercation continued, and another assault took place, when the complainant 
  returned to the house with Farrell to retrieve her dog and personal belongings. 
  After she left a second time, the respondent followed her to Menzies' and Farrell's 
  apartment where, in a heated exchange, he threatened to burn her personal belongings.</p>
<p>
  [34] Hearing all of this when they arrived, the police were fully justified, 
  in my view, in deciding to go to the respondent's house and, accompanied by 
  the complainant who told them that she lived there and had a key, to enter it. 
  They were investigating several potential criminal offences and they had reason 
  to believe that the respondent would destroy the complainant's personal property. 
  Moreover, they wanted to assist the complainant with retrieving her clothing 
  and personal belongings, and getting away from the respondent, so that she could 
  proceed to her parents' home in Belleville.</p>
<p>
  [35] In his cross examination, Constable Paul testified about his reasons for 
  accompanying the complainant to the respondent's residence:</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Well, what - my question is if you had concerns that property 
  was going - did you have concerns that property was going to be burned and that's 
  why you went there, or did you go there because - just to get her personal belongings?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. I went there for both reasons, ma'am, because if he's going 
  - if he says, &quot;I'm going to burn your stuff, I'm going to burn everything,&quot; 
  I'm responsible to protect her life, I'm responsible to protect her property, 
  and as far as I'm concerned it was the logical thing to do, to follow through 
  with this in that manner.</p>
<p>
  [36] I agree with Constable Paul; his decision to accompany the complainant 
  back to the residence was logical. It was also laudable - precisely what a distraught 
  citizen would want and need from a police officer. </p>
<p>
  [37] In summary, the summary conviction appeal judge, explicitly but without 
  reasons, and the trial judge, implicitly through his reasons, held that the 
  police entry into the respondent's dwelling house was lawful. I agree.</p>
<p>
  (2) Lawful conduct inside the residence?</p>
<p>
  [38] Both the summary conviction appeal judge and the trial judge held that 
  the continuing presence of the police officers inside the respondent's residence, 
  and their order to him to move out of the doorway, were not lawful. In reaching 
  this conclusion, both judges appeared to focus on the fact that when the police 
  arrived there was no sign that the respondent was burning, or otherwise causing 
  damage to, the complainant's belongings. Thus, the summary conviction appeal 
  judge stated that there were &quot;no ongoing or continuing exigent circumstances&quot; 
  and, therefore &quot;[t]he police should have exercised better judgment in this 
  matter&quot;. Similarly, the trial judge, after observing that destruction of 
  the complainant's property did not appear to be imminent, concluded that the 
  police &quot;ought to have left the residence at that time and pursued alternate 
  remedies to protect the property of the alleged victim.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [39] With respect, I do not agree with this reasoning. In my view, the conduct 
  of the police inside the respondent's residence also complied with the two-stage 
  Waterfield test, and was, therefore, lawful.</p>
<p>
  [40] The police testified that they accompanied the complainant to the respondent's 
  residence to prevent her belongings from being burned and to assist her in removing 
  them from the dwelling. These were entirely legitimate purposes and, as explained 
  in the previous section, rendered lawful the police entry in the dwelling. </p>
<p>
  [41] The steps the police took inside the dwelling were directed to precisely 
  the same purposes. If the respondent had moved out of the bedroom doorway, the 
  complainant, under the watchful eye of the police, could have safely removed 
  her belongings (one purpose fulfilled) which in turn would have given the respondent 
  no opportunity to burn them (the second purpose fulfilled). The police were 
  fulfilling their common law and statutory duties of protecting property and 
  assisting a victim of crime. The first stage of the Waterfield analysis has 
  been met.</p>
<p>
  [42] Under the second stage of the Waterfield analysis, it is necessary to examine 
  the nature and extent of the liberty interfered with and the importance of the 
  public purpose served by the interference: Dedman at p. 35; Simpson at p. 499. 
  </p>
<p>
  [43] The strong privacy interest that persons have in the sanctity of their 
  own home has often been recognized by the courts. There are, however, circumstances 
  where public policy considerations must take precedence. In Godoy, Lamer C.J.C. 
  stated, at pp. 321 22:</p>
<p class="indent"> There is unquestionably a recognized privacy interest that 
  residents have within the sanctity of the home. In R. v. Plant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 
  281...this Court recognized that the values underlying the privacy interest 
  protected by s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms are (per Sopinka 
  J. at p. 292) &quot;dignity, integrity and autonomy&quot;. In R. v. Edwards, 
  [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, at para. 50, Cory J. elaborated that one aspect of this 
  privacy interest is &quot;[t]he right to be free from intrusion or interference&quot;. 
  However, dignity, integrity and autonomy are the very values engaged in a most 
  immediate and pressing nature by a disconnected 911 call. In such a case, the 
  concern that a person's life or safety might be in danger is enhanced. Therefore, 
  the interest of the person who seeks assistance by dialing 911 is closer to 
  the core of the values of dignity, integrity and autonomy than the interest 
  of the person who seeks to deny entry to police who arrive in response to the 
  call for help. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [44] In my view, those observations by Lamer C.J.C. are applicable to this case. 
  The police had been called to assist a distraught young woman in the middle 
  of the night who, after being assaulted twice, had been forced to flee her boyfriend's 
  residence, without any shoes, and wearing only her pyjamas. </p>
<p>
  [45] There have been significant and commendable changes in recent years in 
  the response of Canadian police to domestic violence situations. There is now 
  a much greater recognition by the police of both the extent and the seriousness 
  of the problem, and the consequences for victims in the community, when the 
  police fail to respond. Police officers are often the first persons called to 
  respond in situations of domestic violence. In my view, it is very much in the 
  public interest that the police, in the discharge of their public duties, be 
  willing and able to assist victims of domestic violence with leaving their relationships 
  and their residences safely and with their belongings. That is precisely what 
  the police did in the present case.</p>
<p>
  [46] The actions of the police in the respondent's residence were geared to 
  a justifiable use of their powers. Constable Paul explained to the respondent 
  that they would leave as soon as the complainant had retrieved her belongings. 
  The complainant wished to enter the bedroom, which she used when she stayed 
  at the respondent's residence, in order to get her clothes. When the respondent 
  refused to allow the complainant to enter the bedroom, the police were justified 
  in ordering the respondent to move, and in arresting him for obstruction when 
  he refused to comply.</p>
<p>
  [47] The respondent contends that the police conduct in this case was more akin 
  to the functions of a bailiff than those of peace officers. It is clear from 
  the proceedings that the summary conviction appeal judge was also thinking along 
  these lines. During the Crown's submissions, he observed:</p>
<p class="indent"> Then he's there maybe in a bailiff situation trying to recover 
  personal items on behalf of the girlfriend of the Respondent. And that's where 
  I have concern I think in my mind. I mean where you have to convince me is that 
  I think any escalation in that house was at the hands - or as a result of the 
  actions by the police and not by the Respondent.</p>
<p>
  [48] I do not think the bailiff analogy is apt. There is no dispute about the 
  complainant's ownership of the personal belongings she left behind in the respondent's 
  dwelling when she made her abrupt departure. Nor is there even the slightest 
  hint that the events that unfolded that night were civil in nature, not criminal. 
  </p>
<p>
  [49] The respondent also contends that the police should have followed a different 
  course of conduct that evening. He relies on the observations of the summary 
  conviction appeal judge during the Crown's submissions:</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: They [the police] could have cautioned her and said, 
  &quot;The best thing for you to do is remain right here [at the Farrell/Menzies 
  apartment] and you know, in the daylight hours there's things to do&quot;.</p>
<p class="indent">MR. HEWITT: And if . . .</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: &quot;If not, we'll go over there [to the respondent's 
  house] with you and if it looks like he's burning the property then we'll do 
  something about it. If he's not, then we're going to leave. All right.&quot; 
  That's what a normal, reasonable police officer would have done. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [50] I disagree with these suggestions about proper police behaviour in the 
  context of a volatile domestic dispute. The suggestion that the police might 
  have advised the complainant to do nothing until the morning ignores the facts 
  that she had been assaulted to an extent that the police noticed a scratch mark 
  under her eyes, that it was the middle of the night and she had only pyjamas, 
  and that an angry boyfriend had just attacked her dog and threatened to burn 
  all of her belongings. A suggestion by the police that neither they nor the 
  complainant do anything until the morning would have been unhelpful and inappropriate.</p>
<p>
  [51] I described the police entry into the respondent's residence as logical, 
  laudable and lawful. The same words apply to their conduct inside the dwelling.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [52] I would allow the appeal, quash the acquittals relating to the offences 
  of obstructing a peace officer and assault resist arrest, substitute verdicts 
  of guilty, and remit the matter to the trial judge to enter convictions and 
  impose sentences.</p>
