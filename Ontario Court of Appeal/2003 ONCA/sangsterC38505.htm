<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] On April 19, 2000, Langdon J. issued default judgment against the appellant 
  and granted the respondent, amongst other things, a divorce, an order for property 
  division, child support in the amount of $800 per month, an order for an immediate 
  payment of child support accruing under an order of August 6, 1993 and costs.</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent's affidavit material filed in support of the motion for default 
  judgment misled the court in a number of ways including the following:</p>
<p class="indent"> 1. stating that the appellant failed to file an Answer and 
  Counter-petition without acknowledging that an answer and counter-petition had 
  been served;</p>
<p class="indent">2. stating that the appellant refused to pay child support when 
  the respondent had received $37,455.47 in child support since separation, which 
  was an average of $480 per month; and</p>
<p class="indent">3. stating that the appellant was represented by counsel for 
  four months of the negotiations &quot;which commenced in February, 1993 and 
  represented himself for the balance of the time&quot;. It was not disclosed 
  that the appellant had counsel of record since February of 1999.</p>
<p>
  [3] It is to be noted that counsel for the respondent on appeal was not counsel 
  below.</p>
<p>
  [4] Neither the appellant nor his counsel were put on notice that the procedural 
  error of serving an answer and counter-petition, rather than filing it, would 
  be relied upon in support of default proceedings. Nor were they notified that 
  a motion for default judgment was being brought.</p>
<p>
  [5] Counsel for the appellant was not served with a copy of the default judgment.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant moved, unsuccessfully, before Herold J. to have the default 
  judgment set aside in relation to the corollary relief. He took no issue with 
  the granting of the divorce. He appeals from the dismissal of that motion.</p>
<p>
  [7] The want of full and fair disclosure is sufficient reason to allow the appeal 
  and we would allow the appeal on that basis alone. The court is entitled to 
  rely on materials filed as being full and frank, particularly where, as here, 
  the motion is brought on an ex parte basis.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appeal is allowed and the order of Herold J. is set aside. The default 
  judgment of Langdon J. dated April 19, 2000 is set aside except for paragraphs 
  1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 which shall remain. Paragraph 4 of the default judgment shall 
  be amended to read that neither party may remove the child from the Province 
  without notice to the other.</p>
<p>
  [9] The funds referred to in paragraph 14 of the default judgment are to be 
  returned to the trust fund held by Simmons, da Silva &amp; Sinton. The husband 
  shall file and serve an answer and counter-petition within seven days of today's 
  date.</p>
<p>
  [10] In light of the misleading affidavit filed in support of the default motion, 
  it is our view that the appellant is entitled to his costs of the motion below 
  on a substantial indemnity basis. The appellant is also awarded his costs of 
  this appeal on a partial indemnity basis. We fix those costs at $2,500 and $2,500 
  respectively, as requested.</p>
