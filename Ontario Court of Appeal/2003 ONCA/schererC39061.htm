<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Peter B. Hambly of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated October 3, 2002</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants appeal from the order of Hambly J. dismissing their motion 
  and allowing the respondent's cross-motion to the extent that it sought the 
  dismissal of the appellants' motion on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata. 
  In their motion, brought in February 2002, the appellants sought various forms 
  of relief including: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">1. An order setting aside the order of Wallace J. dated July 
  24, 1998;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">2. An order requiring the respondent to pay to the appellants 
  the costs of a motion for an interim injunction granted by Salhany J. on June 
  24, 1998; and<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">3. An order requiring the respondent to pay damages sustained 
  by the appellants as a result of the interim injunction imposed by Salhany J. 
  and a reference to determine the amount of the damages.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] For reasons that follow, we would uphold the order of Hambly J. and dismiss 
  the appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] In our view, Hambly J. was entitled to rely upon the doctrine of res judicata 
  as a basis for refusing the appellants' request to set aside Wallace J.'s order 
  of July 24, 1998. In this regard, we agree with Hambly J. that the setting aside 
  of Wallace J.'s order was central to an earlier motion heard by him in June 
  2000 in which the appellants sought summary judgment on the action and costs 
  (and/or damages under rule 40.03) arising from the interim injunction granted 
  by Salhany J. on June 24, 1998. While the costs component of the motion required 
  the appellants to negate the order of Wallace J., they did not move at that 
  time to set it aside. In view of that, Hambly J. was correct in holding that 
  the setting aside of Wallace J.'s order was relief the appellants could and 
  should have sought, if at all, in their June 2000 motion before him.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] To the extent that Hambly J. had a discretion whether to apply the doctrine 
  of res judicata to bar the relief sought by the appellants in their February 
  2002 motion, which forms the subject matter of this appeal, we believe for several 
  reasons that he did not err in exercising his discretion as he did.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] First, in the aftermath of Wallace J.'s order, the parties conducted themselves 
  as if the interim injunction issued by Salhany J. had been dissolved. The appellants 
  were thus able to continue their work on the golf course within 200 feet of 
  the respondent's lot, something that they could not have done had Salhany J.'s 
  interim injunction remained in force. On that basis alone, there is a strong 
  argument that the appellants should be estopped by their conduct from seeking 
  damages that may have been occasioned by the interim injunction. The appellants 
  had the benefit of the order of Wallace J., which they now seek to set aside.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] Second, as the respondent correctly points out, the appellants have not 
  particularized or quantified the damages (apart from legal costs) that they 
  allegedly suffered as a result of the interim injunction. In this respect, we 
  find the following aspect of Hambly J.'s reasons compelling:<br>
  The defendants [appellants] claimed damages which they allege that they suffered 
  from the granting of the injunction. Apart from the legal costs in defending 
  the motion, they do not specify what these damages are, although they seek a 
  reference to determine the quantum. It is difficult to understand what damages 
  the defendants could have suffered in the space of 30 days by being prevented 
  from working within 200 feet of the plaintiff's [respondent's] lot. I agree 
  with Mr. Keller that the substance of the defendants' claim would appear to 
  be for the costs of the proceeding before Justice Salhany. </p>
<p class="indent">In other words, although clothed differently, it appeared to 
  Hambly J., as it does to us, that the appellants' February 2002 motion was essentially 
  an attempt to circumvent their earlier failure to obtain their costs of the 
  injunction proceedings. In June 2000, Hambly J. ordered, among other things, 
  that the appellants be paid their costs of the proceedings before Salhany J. 
  on a solicitor and client basis. That aspect of his order was subsequently set 
  aside by this court on February 13, 2001 because of the appellants' failure 
  to have Wallace J.'s order of July 24, 1998 set aside. In the result, therefore, 
  the appellants' efforts to recover the costs of the injunction proceedings were 
  unsuccessful because they failed to initiate the proper procedural step.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] Third, much time has passed since the orders of Salhany J. and Wallace 
  J. Although the appellants cannot be held accountable for all of the delay, 
  we fail to see how the interests of justice would be advanced by permitting 
  them to proceed, some five years later, with a damages claim that to this day 
  remains unspecified and unquantified.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] For these reasons, we are not persuaded that Hambly J. erred in relying 
  upon the doctrine of res judicata as a basis for rejecting the appellants' request 
  to set aside Wallace J.'s order.<br>
</p>
<p>[9] The remaining question is whether Wallace J.'s order constitutes a bar 
  to the appellants' attempt to now seek damages arising from Salhany J.'s interim 
  injunction. Hambly J. addressed that issue, at least indirectly, in his reasons 
  as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, Justice Wallace's order is not only a bar to the 
  defendants obtaining costs of the motion resulting in the interim injunction 
  ordered by Justice Salhany, it is also a bar to the defendants obtaining an 
  order that the plaintiff pay damages pursuant to its undertaking to pay damages 
  in the event that it was found that the interim injunction ought not to have 
  been issued. The defendants consented to the interim injunction being dissolved. 
  The defendants imposed no conditions on the injunction being dissolved. The 
  defendants now ask for damages resulting from the granting of the injunction. 
  It is barred from doing so by Justice Wallace's order [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>[10] As Hambly J. points out in this passage, the appellants sought no conditions 
  on the injunction being dissolved. Accordingly, as one would expect, Wallace 
  J.'s order is silent on the matter of damages, just as it is silent on the matter 
  of costs. In the circumstances, we do not accept the appellants' contention 
  that the issue of damages was left open following Wallace J.'s order, which 
  was obtained on consent of the parties. On the contrary, we are satisfied that 
  it was the clear intention of the parties that Wallace J.'s order act as a bar 
  to any claim that the appellants might have for damages arising out of the interim 
  injunction. Otherwise, the respondent surely would not have consented to the 
  order.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] Accordingly, we agree with Hambly J. that Wallace J.'s order bars the 
  appellants from obtaining damages (if any) occasioned by the interim injunction.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] For these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal with costs of the appeal 
  awarded to the respondent on a partial indemnity scale, fixed at $10,000 inclusive 
  of GST and disbursements.<br>
