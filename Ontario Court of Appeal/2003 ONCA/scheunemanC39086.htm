<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Kenneth Pedlar of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated October 18, 2002.</p>
<p>CRONK J.A.:<br>
</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal from the order of Pedlar J. of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated October 18, 2002 striking out the appellant's statement of claim 
  on the basis that the court lacks jurisdiction to deal with the issues sought 
  to be raised by the appellant in his pleading. The appellant raises four grounds 
  of appeal from that order, each of which is addressed in the reasons that follow.<br>
</p>
<p>1. Jurisdiction<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The claims sought to be advanced by the appellant have been heard and decided 
  by a labour adjudicator under the dispute resolution mechanisms provided in 
  the Public Service Staff Relations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-35 (the &quot;Act&quot;) 
  and the collective agreement by which the appellant was bound at the time of 
  the events in issue. Based on this court's decision in Jadwani v. Canada (Attorney 
  General) (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 660 and the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in Weber v. Ontario Hydro, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929, the appellant was obliged to 
  pursue the grievance and adjudication process established by the Act and the 
  collective agreement. He did so. Accordingly, he has had the opportunity to 
  litigate the matters forming the basis of the allegations that he seeks to advance 
  in his proposed statement of claim. <br>
</p>
<p>[3] The essential character of the appellant's proposed action, in my view, 
  falls within the scope of the grievance and adjudication process under the Act 
  and the collective agreement. Further, the adjudication thereunder was based 
  on substantially the same facts alleged by the appellant in his statement of 
  claim. <br>
</p>
<p>[4] The motions judge concluded, in those circumstances, that the court is 
  without jurisdiction to hear and decide the claims sought to be advanced by 
  the appellant. I agree. <br>
</p>
<p>[5] Moreover, in my view, even if the court has jurisdiction to entertain the 
  appellant's proposed claims, this is an appropriate case in which to decline 
  such jurisdiction. Although the appellant relies upon the decision of this court 
  in Guenette v. Canada (Attorney General) (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 601 to argue that 
  there is no impediment to his action proceeding notwithstanding the prior adjudication 
  under the Act and the collective agreement, the decision in Guenette does not 
  assist the appellant. That case concerned disputes that were not referable to 
  adjudication. That is not this case. <br>
</p>
<p>2. Other Grounds of Appeal<br>
</p>
<p>[6] I would also reject the appellant's remaining grounds of appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] First, contrary to the appellant's submissions, the motions judge did not 
  deny him a hearing in writing or fail to consider the appellant's written materials. 
  To the contrary, the order of the motions judge indicates that the motion records 
  and the factums filed by the parties were considered by the motions judge and 
  that, although the appellant was properly served with the respondent's notice 
  of motion, he failed to appear before the motions judge. The transcript of the 
  proceedings indicates that the respondent's counsel informed the motions judge 
  of the appellant's request that the motion be determined on the basis of the 
  written materials filed by the parties, and of the respondent's consent thereto, 
  and the motions judge proceeded on that basis. Accordingly, I would reject the 
  appellant's submissions that he was denied the benefit of a written hearing 
  concerning the motion to strike and that his written materials were not considered 
  by the motions judge.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] Second, the appellant argues that the costs award made against him by the 
  motions judge offended his rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
  The appellant led no evidence before the motions judge establishing that he 
  could not afford to pay costs. As well, he filed no affidavit materials in response 
  to the respondent's motion to strike his pleading or concerning the issue of 
  costs. As argued by the respondent on this appeal, Charter challenges cannot 
  be determined in a factual void and in the absence of an evidentiary context. 
  Accordingly, the appellant's Charter challenge concerning costs fails.<br>
</p>
<p>[9] Third, there is no basis for the appellant's assertion that the motions 
  judge exhibited institutional or personal bias. Simply stated, there is no evidence 
  to ground that claim. In the absence of any evidence to support the appellant's 
  allegation that he could not afford to pay costs, the motions judge's award 
  of costs against the appellant does not demonstrate a reasonable apprehension 
  of bias. Similarly, given the history of litigation by the appellant concerning 
  this matter, there was no impropriety or bias demonstrated by the order of the 
  motions judge that the appellant be precluded from initiating further proceedings 
  between the parties until the costs awarded against him, in the amount of $1,000.00, 
  were paid in full.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] Finally, I have also considered that the claims sought to be advanced 
  by the appellant in his statement of claim include an allegation of conspiracy. 
  The appellant, however, failed to plead the requisite material facts to support 
  an alleged conspiracy. Accordingly, even if such a cause of action could survive 
  the adjudication which has already taken place under the collective agreement 
  and the Act, it was not properly pleaded by the appellant.<br>
</p>
<p>3. Disposition<br>
</p>
<p>[11] For the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal. The respondent is entitled 
  to his costs of the appeal, if requested, on a partial indemnity basis fixed 
  in the amount of $1,000.00, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services 
  Tax. </p>
<p>RELEASED:&quot;RSA&quot; &quot;JUN 30 2003&quot; </p>

  &quot;I agree R. S. Abella J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot; I agree R. G. Juriansz ad hoc&quot;</p>
