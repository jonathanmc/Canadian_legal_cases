<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Peter G. Jarvis of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 20, 2002.</p>
<p>GILLESE J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] Mary Arhonto Sears lives with her mother and two of her siblings in the 
  family home at 72 Mulholland Avenue, Toronto. Her mother and siblings wanted 
  to renovate the home. Mary Sears, however, refused to take liability for the 
  mortgage that would be placed on the property in order to finance the renovations.</p>
<p>[2] After receiving a letter from her siblings telling her to pay rent or be 
  evicted, Mary Sears unsuccessfully brought an application for a declaration 
  that a transfer of title and mortgage registered against the property were of 
  no force and effect. She appeals from dismissal of that application. For the 
  reasons that follow, I am of the view that the appeal should be allowed.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>[3] Nicholas Sears and his wife, Marie Sears, had four children. Mary Sears, 
  the appellant, is one of those children. The individual respondents to the application 
  are Mary Sears&#146; mother, Marie Sears and her two siblings who also reside 
  at the family home, Paul Sears and Athena Mallioux. </p>
<p>[4] Mary Sears had a very close relationship with her father. When he died, 
  he left a will in which he gave Mary Sears the family home. </p>
<p>[5] The appellant&#146;s mother, Marie Sears, took steps to attack the validity 
  of the will and obtain title to the property. During the legal proceedings, 
  Mary Sears and her mother settled the dispute through mediation and executed 
  Minutes of Settlement. </p>
<p>[6] Greer J. considered the Minutes of Settlement at a hearing in which the 
  parties were represented by counsel and issued a judgment (&#147;the Judgment&#148;), 
  the operative sections of which are set out below.</p>
<p class="indent">1. THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that the house located at 
  72 Mulholland Avenue, Toronto, Ontario (&#147;the house&#148;), more particularly 
  described in Schedule &#147;A&#148; hereto, shall be transferred by the Estate 
  trustee without a will of Nicholas Sears&#146; (a.k.a. Nick Sarafopoulos) to 
  Marie Sears as her own property absolutely. The only mortgage which Marie Sears 
  may register against the property shall be a mortgage from which the proceeds 
  are used by her for capital improvements and repairs to the said property.</p>
<p class="indent">2. THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that Marie Sears agrees 
  to attend on a solicitor to have a Last Will and Testament drawn for her and 
  Marie Sears and Mary Arhonto Sears shall execute an agreement that upon Marie 
  Sears&#146; death 35% of the net value of the house and its contents, shall 
  be paid to or delivered to Mary Arhonto Sears, and that in addition thereto, 
  Mary Arhonto Sears shall receive under Marie Sears&#146; Will, not less than 
  the same share as Marie Sears&#146; largest beneficiary receives in the remainder 
  of Marie Sears&#146; estate.</p>
<p class="indent">3. THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that in the event 
  the house is sold prior to Marie Sears&#146; death, Mary Arhonto Sears shall 
  receive 35% of the net proceeds of the sale of the house and shall still be 
  entitled to receive an amount equal to the amount received by the largest beneficiary 
  of the estate of Marie Sears on her death.</p>
<p class="indent">4. THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that Mary Arhonto 
  Sears shall be at liberty to reside with Marie Sears without expense for so 
  long as she lives and no demand for any payment on account of the residence 
  or ongoing expenses shall be made upon her. In the event the property located 
  at 72 Mulholland Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, is sold, then Mary Arhonto Sears, 
  upon receipt of the said 35%, agrees to forthwith find her own accommodations 
  at her own expense.</p>
<p class="indent">6. THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that there shall be 
  no further claims between the parties and this action is hereby dismissed without 
  costs.</p>
<p>[7] Title to the property was transferred to Marie Sears pursuant to the Judgment.</p>
<p>[8] Mary Sears lived with her mother and brother, Paul Sears, at the family 
  home. Later, her sister, Athena Mallioux, moved in with her two children. Stresses 
  arose.</p>
<p>[9] Marie Sears attempted to obtain mortgage financing in order to make substantial 
  repairs and renovations to the home. Marie Sears asked Mary Sears to accept 
  liability for the mortgage. After Mary Sears refused, Marie Sears told her that 
  she would transfer the property to Athena Mallioux and Paul Sears, as they were 
  willing to assist with the mortgage. </p>
<p>[10] Mary Sears then received a letter from her two siblings telling her that 
  they owned the home and that she had to pay rent of $650 per month or she would 
  be evicted.</p>
<p>[11] A title search revealed that Marie Sears had transferred title to the 
  respondents, Paul Sears and Athena Mallioux, and that a mortgage in favour of 
  the corporate respondent in the amount of $215,000 had been registered against 
  the property.</p>
<p>[12] The transfer deed indicated that Paul Sears and Athena Mallioux each received 
  an undivided one-half interest in the property and that consideration for the 
  transaction was $175,000. However, when cross-examined, Marie Sears and Athena 
  Mallioux refused to answer whether the $175,000 had been paid for the property. 
  Some of the answers given by Marie Sears suggest that she received no money 
  on account of the sale of the property. </p>
<p>[13] The individual respondents told Mary Sears that they would arrange for 
  an independent appraisal of the property. There is no evidence that such an 
  appraisal was obtained. In cross-examination, Athena Mallioux testified that 
  no appraisal had been conducted. The individual respondents invited Mary Sears 
  to obtain an appraisal of her own. She chose not to.</p>
<p>[14] The individual respondents maintain that, in accordance with paragraph 
  3 of the Judgment, Mary Sears is entitled to $61,250, which is 35% of $175,000. 
</p>
<p>[15] The position advanced on behalf of Mary Sears throughout these proceedings 
  has been that the transfer from Marie Sears to Paul Sears and Athena Mallioux 
  was a fraudulent conveyance. The applications judge rejected that argument. 
  He noted that the burden of proof of a fraudulent conveyance lay with the appellant 
  and found that there was no evidence to satisfy him that the value ascribed 
  to the property was other than fair market value. As the appellant failed to 
  discharge the burden, her application was dismissed.</p>
<p>[16] The applications judge also rejected Mary Sears&#146; request for rectification 
  of the Judgment. This determination has not been appealed. </p>
<p>[17] The appellant appeals on the basis that the applications judge incorrectly 
  decided the matter of the alleged fraudulent conveyance. She also moves to introduce 
  fresh evidence of the value of the property as at June 24, 2002, the date that 
  the transfer deed was registered. In addition, she seeks leave to appeal the 
  costs award below.</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>[18] In my view, the applications judge correctly decided the matter of the 
  alleged fraudulent conveyance. However, that part of the dispute relating to 
  the sale of the property is properly resolved on trust law principles, not the 
  law of fraudulent conveyances. At the hearing of the appeal, the respondents 
  conceded that the pleadings permit the matter to be considered on the basis 
  of trust law principles.</p>
<p>[19] Paragraph 1 of the Judgment resulted in Marie Sears becoming the legal 
  titleholder to the property. </p>
<p>[20] Paragraph 3 of the Judgment implicitly gives Marie Sears the right to 
  sell the property, as it provides that the property can be sold before her death. 
  However, paragraph 3 explicitly provides that if the property is sold, Mary 
  Sears is entitled to 35% of the net sale proceeds. In other words, Mary Sears 
  is entitled to a 35% beneficial interest in the sale proceeds of the property. 
</p>
<p>[21] Moreover, paragraph 4 of the Judgment gives Mary Sears the right to live 
  in the property, without expense, until her death or until the property is sold.</p>
<p>[22] The combined effect of paragraphs 3 and 4 is to make Marie Sears trustee 
  of the property at the point of sale. As trustee, Marie Sears is obliged to 
  act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. A trustee must use all reasonable 
  diligence to obtain the best price for the property and must pay fair and equal 
  attention to the interests of all persons concerned. See Slater v. Badenach 
  (1884), 10 S.C.R. 296.</p>
<p>[23] On the record before this court, it is not clear that the property has 
  actually been sold. Marie Sears is entitled to sell the property; she is not 
  entitled simply to transfer title to others nor is she entitled to buy out Mary 
  Sears&#146; interest in the property. The fact that a transfer of the property 
  was executed and registered does not mean that a sale actually took place. A 
  sale involves transfer for consideration. </p>
<p>[24] The burden of proof is on Marie Sears, as trustee, to show both that the 
  trust property was actually sold and, if it were, that she obtained a sale price 
  that discharges her obligation to Mary Sears qua beneficiary. </p>
<p>[25] Marie Sears has not proven that the property was actually sold and, if 
  it was, that the value of $175,000 ascribed to the property was the fair market 
  value at the date of sale. One might consider that the mortgage for $215,000, 
  the basis for which amount is not explained in the record, is evidence to the 
  contrary but that need not be decided. As trustee, Marie Sears may only sell 
  the property for an amount that demonstrates that she has acted solely in the 
  best interests of the beneficiaries.</p>
<p>[26] In light of these conclusions, there is no need to consider Mary Sears&#146; 
  motion to introduce fresh evidence.</p>
<p>Disposition</p>
<p>[27] For the reasons given, the appeal is allowed and this matter is referred 
  back for trial of the following issues:</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) Did Marie Sears sell the property municipally described 
  as 72 Mulholland Avenue, Toronto? </p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) If so, upon what date did the sale take place and what 
  was the fair market value of the property on the sale date? </p>
<p>[23] The appellant is entitled to her costs on appeal and below. Costs of the 
  appeal are fixed at $6,000. </p>
