<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The issue on this appeal is whether the appellant insurance company is
  entitled to have the court order that the trial of the plaintiff's action
  on the insurance contract and for bad faith punitive damages be bifurcated
  in order to protect the insurance company from disclosing privileged communications
  in the bad faith claim, which could also be used to its prejudice in the contract
  claim. </p>
<p>
  [2] The Divisional Court noted that on the evidence in the record, the appellant
  has not provided evidence that it in fact intends, or will be obliged, to waive
  privilege in respect of solicitor-client communications in order to defend
  the bad faith claim. Counsel has explained that when the motion was initiated,
  several of the important cases in this area were not yet decided, including
  the Supreme Court's decision in Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Company, [2002]
  S.C.J. No. 19 and this court's decision in Khazzaka (c.o.b. E.S.M. Auto
  Body v. Commercial Union Assurance Co. of Canada, [2002] O.J. No. 3110.</p>
<p>
  [3]	We accept that the law in this area has changed since the appellant's
  material was prepared. However, on the record before this court, we agree with
  the Divisional Court that there is no evidence that the appellant will actually
  suffer the prejudice alleged from disclosing privileged communications. We
  would therefore dismiss the appeal but without prejudice to the appellant's
  right, if so advised, to bring a further motion on the appropriate evidence.
  The respondents of course will be able to respond as advised. </p>
<p>
  [4] On consent, costs of the leave motion and of the appeal are to be $9,000
  inclusive of disbursements and GST, payable to the respondents.</p>
