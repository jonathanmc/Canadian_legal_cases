<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Harvey Spiegel of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 22, 2003.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [1] The respondent was convicted in California of various offences including 
  criminal harassment. He fled the United States during his trial, was convicted 
  in absentia and was eventually arrested in Canada. The United States seeks his 
  extradition on the charges for which he was convicted including the harassment 
  charge, as well as two additional charges that are outstanding against the respondent 
  in the United States.</p>
<p>
  [2] At the extradition hearing, the respondent moved for a stay alleging abuse 
  of process. That motion was dismissed and there is no appeal from that order.</p>
<p>
  [3] The Extradition Judge ordered the respondent committed for extradition on 
  all charges except the harassment charge. He held that the United States had 
  failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the conduct giving rise 
  to the conviction in California corresponded to the offence of criminal harassment 
  as set out s. 264(1) of the Criminal Code. In reaching that conclusion, the 
  Extradition Judge observed that unlike the Canadian crime of harassment, the 
  harassment charge under California penal law did not require proof that the 
  conduct of the accused caused the victim to reasonably fear for her safety. 
  The Extradition Judge was not satisfied on the totality of the evidence that 
  the victim had feared for her safety as a result of the respondent's conduct. 
  He ordered the respondent discharged on the harassment charge. </p>
<p>
  [4] The United States appealed the discharge on the harassment count. There 
  is no appeal from the committal for extradition on the other charges. </p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant advanced three arguments on appeal. Counsel submitted that 
  the Extradition Judge erred in law in placing a balance of probabilities onus 
  on the United States under s. 29(1)(b) of the Extradition Act S.C. 1999 c.18 
  (the Act). Counsel further submitted that the Extradition Judge erred in law 
  in admitting a transcript of the evidence given by the victim in the California 
  proceedings. Lastly, counsel contended that even if the trial judge did not 
  commit the two errors outlined above, he erred in holding that the United States 
  had not met its onus under s. 29(1)(b) of the Act.</p>
<p>
  [6] At the conclusion of oral argument, the court indicated that the appeal 
  was dismissed with reasons to follow. </p>
<p>
  [7] I agree with the trial judge that s. 29(1)(b) places a balance of probabilities 
  onus on the party seeking extradition. I also think that the trial judge was 
  entitled to admit the transcript of the victim's testimony pursuant to 
  s. 32(1)(c) of the Act. Lastly, I cannot say that his conclusion that the United 
  States had failed to meet its onus was unreasonable or against the evidence.</p>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  [8] The harassment charge in the California indictment reads: </p>
<p class="indent">
  On or about and between April 14, 2000 and May 3, 2000, in the County of Santa 
  Clara, state of California, the crime of stalking, in violation of Penal Code 
  s. 646.9(a) a felony, was committed by [the respondent] who did willfully, maliciously, 
  and repeatedly follow and harass Jane Doe and make a credible threat with the 
  intent to place her in reasonable fear for her safety and/or the safety of her 
  immediate family. </p>
<p>[9] It was common ground in argument before this court that under California 
  law, the prosecution was not required to prove that the victim reasonably feared 
  for her safety as a result of the conduct of the accused. Under the California 
  Penal Code, the prosecution was required to prove that the accused intended 
  to place the victim in reasonable fear for her safety. Criminal harassment, 
  as defined in s. 264 of the Criminal Code, the corresponding offence relied 
  on by the United States in its extradition request, requires that the prosecution 
  prove that the harassing conduct "causes that other person reasonably 
  in all of the circumstances to fear for their safety".</p>
<p>
  [10] The Record of the Case submitted by the United States on the extradition 
  hearing included a description of the conduct for which the respondent was convicted 
  in California as required by s. 33(1)(b)(ii) of the Act. According to that description, 
  the victim was frightened on each of the three occasions when she was confronted 
  by the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [11] Over the objection of counsel for the United States, the Extradition Judge 
  admitted a transcript of the victim's evidence given in the California 
  proceedings. In doing so, he relied on s. 32(1)(c) of the Act, which permits 
  the admission of evidence that is reliable and relevant. The reliability of 
  the transcript was acknowledged and the Extradition Judge held that it was relevant 
  since it described the conduct of the respondent and the victim's reaction 
  to that conduct. The victim's description of her state of mind when confronted 
  by the respondent was inconsistent with the information contained in the Record 
  of the Case. The victim's evidence arguably negated any contention that 
  she feared for her safety as a result of the respondent's harassing conduct.</p>
<p>
  [12] The Extradition Judge also admitted the transcript of the evidence given 
  by the investigating officer at the California proceedings. That evidence supported 
  the contention that the victim was afraid because of the respondent's 
  harassing conduct.</p>
<p>
  [13] Relying primarily on the transcript of the victim's evidence, the 
  Extradition Judge held</p>
<p class="indent"> &#8230; This evidence falls far short of establishing or even 
  raising an inference that she feared for her safety.</p>
<p class="indent"> [14] The Extradition Judge went on to hold that absent a finding 
  that the victim feared for her safety, it could not be said that the conduct 
  underlying the California conviction corresponded to the offence of criminal 
  harassment as defined in the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  The Onus of Proof</p>
<p>
  [15] The test to be applied in determining whether to commit a person for an 
  extradition is set out in s. 29(1) of the Act: </p>
<p class="indent">
  29(1) A judge shall order the committal of the person into custody to await 
  surrender if</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) in the case of a person sought for prosecution, there is 
  evidence admissible under this Act of conduct that, had it occurred in Canada, 
  would justify committal for trial in Canada on the offence set out in the authority 
  to proceed and the judge is satisfied that the person is the person sought by 
  the extradition partner; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) in the case of a person sought for the imposition or enforcement 
  of a sentence, the judge is satisfied that the conviction was in respect of 
  conduct that corresponds to the offence set out in the authority to proceed 
  and that the person is the person who was convicted. [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [16] Section 29(1)(a) addresses situations in which the target of the extradition 
  has been charged in the foreign state but has not been convicted. Section 29(1)(b) 
  addresses extraditions requests where the target has been convicted in the foreign 
  state. </p>
<p>
  [17] The motion judge described the onus in s. 29(1)(b) in these terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I must be satisfied that the conduct for which [the respondent] was convicted 
  would more probably than not, correspond to each and every element of the offence 
  set out in the ATP [Authority To Proceed].</p>
<p> [18] I agree that the use of the word "satisfied" in s. 29(1)(b) 
  connotes a balance of probabilities standard: Re Pacificador v. The Republic 
  of The Philippines (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 210 at 214 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal 
  to S.C.C. refused (1994) 87 C.C.C. (3d) vi. The party seeking extradition must 
  prove on the balance of probabilities that</p>
<ul>
  <li> the foreign conviction is in respect of conduct that corresponds to the 
    Canadian offence relied on by the party seeking extradition;</li>
  <li> the person before the extradition court is the person who was convicted 
    in the foreign court.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [19] While the appellant concedes that the balance of probabilities standard 
  applies to identity, the second of the two issues described above, the appellant 
  maintains that a much different standard applies to the first. The appellant 
  contends that any evidence to establish the requisite correspondence is sufficient. 
  Section 29(1)(b) uses the word "satisfied" in reference to both 
  issues. It would be contrary to basic principles of statutory interpretation 
  to read the same word as simultaneously having two very different meanings in 
  the same sentence: R. v. Chabot (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 385 at 400-401 (S.C.C.). 
  </p>
<p>
  [20] Counsel for the appellant submitted that logic dictated that post-conviction 
  extradition should be easier than extradition before trial. She argued that 
  the imposition of a balance of probabilities standard in s. 29(1)(b) of the 
  Act defies this logic by imposing a higher burden on post-conviction extradition 
  requests than the burden on requests for extradition of persons facing charges 
  under s. 29(1)(a). I disagree with this submission. First, while I think the 
  Act is clearly intended to provide a simplified means of extraditing those convicted 
  in foreign jurisdictions (see E. Krival, T. Beveridge, J. Hayward, A Practical 
  Guide to Extradition (Carswell 2002) p. 234-237), a balance of probabilities 
  standard does not complicate that process, given the measures available in the 
  Act and in the various treaties to facilitate proof of the facts described in 
  s. 29(1)(b). </p>
<p>
  [21] I also do not find the comparison between the burdens of proof in the two 
  subsections of s. 29 helpful. The two subsections address very different situations 
  and, not surprisingly, do so in different ways. Section 29(1)(a) is a pre-trial 
  process. The onus described in s. 29(1)(a) is the onus customarily used in Canadian 
  criminal law to screen out those charges which do not merit trial. It is entirely 
  consistent with Canadian criminal practice to use this standard in determining 
  whether persons should be extradited to foreign countries to face trial. Section 
  29(1)(b) is not a pre-trial process. It is concerned with the identity of the 
  person before the extradition court and with the question of whether the conduct 
  underlying the foreign conviction corresponds to the conduct targeted by the 
  Canadian offence. To the extent that the inquiry is factual, it looks to past 
  or existing events. A balance of probabilities standard is the usual standard 
  applied to a fact-finding inquiry. The use of the word "satisfied" 
  confirms that the usual standard is meant to apply to this fact-finding process.</p>
<p>
  [22] I also see no merit in the contention that a balance of probabilities standard 
  will disrupt the effective and efficient operation of the extradition process 
  in cases where there has been a conviction entered in the foreign state. Given 
  the means provided in the Act and in various treaties to establish the necessary 
  criteria for extradition, I would think that in the vast majority of cases, 
  proof on the balance of probabilities that the foreign conviction was in respect 
  of conduct that corresponds to the identified Canadian offence will be a straight 
  forward matter: e.g. see United States of America v. Bonamie, [2001] A.J. No. 
  1134 at para. 31 (Alta. C.A.). In deciding whether the requesting state has 
  discharged its burden under s. 29(1)(b) the validity of the foreign conviction 
  must be accepted: Krival, A Practical Guide to Extradition, supra, pp. 237-38.</p>
<p>
  [23] Difficulties in meeting the required onus arose in the case for two reasons. 
  First, the corresponding Canadian offence contained an element which was not 
  essential to the proof of the California charge. Consequently, the fact that 
  the respondent was convicted in California, did not, in and of itself, establish 
  that his conviction was in respect of conduct that corresponded to the Canadian 
  offence. Secondly, the information relied on by the United States to establish 
  the needed additional element was contradicted by the transcript of the victim's 
  evidence given in the California proceedings. I would think contradictions between 
  the material submitted by the state requesting extradition and the evidence 
  relied on to secure the conviction in the foreign state would be rare.</p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant also argues that a lower onus of proof was applied in United 
  States of America v. Persaud, [1999] O.J. No. 4922 (Ont. Superior Court) and 
  in Bonami, supra. Neither case addresses the onus of proof under s. 29(1)(b). 
  Ewaschuk J. in Persaud comments at para. 15: </p>
<p class="indent">
  What s. 29(1)(b) requires is merely a summary of the material facts underlying 
  the foreign convictions. In this case, the documents filed in support of the 
  application make no reference whatsoever to the factual conduct underlying the 
  convictions which will permit me to determine whether the conduct corresponds 
  to the Canadian offences set out in the authority to proceed.</p>
<p>
  [25] I take no exception to the observations of Ewaschuk J. In this case, unlike 
  Persaud, there was evidence of the factual conduct underlying the American conviction. 
  However, the evidence was not all one way. In my view the Extradition Judge 
  was required to consider all of the evidence and decide whether he was "satisfied" 
  that the conduct underlying the California conviction corresponded to the Canadian 
  offence. </p>
<p>
  [26] Although I agree with the trial judge's holding that s. (29(1)(b) 
  requires proof on the balance of probabilities of both factual issues referred 
  to in that provision, I would not want to be taken as necessarily agreeing that 
  s. 29(1)(b) requires an exact correspondence between the conduct underlying 
  the American offence and each and every element of the Canadian offence. It 
  may be that the word "corresponds" in s. 29(1)(b) permits some variation 
  between the conduct underlying the American offence and the constituent elements 
  of the Canadian offence. This appeal was argued on the basis that evidence that 
  the victim feared for her safety was necessary to establish the requisite correspondence 
  between conduct underlying the American offence and the Canadian offence relied 
  on for the purpose of extradition. I leave the exact meaning of the word "corresponds" 
  to a case where its meaning is put in issue.</p>
<p>
  The Admissibility of the Transcript of the Victim's Evidence</p>
<p>
  [27] Section 32(1)(c) of the Act reads: </p>
<p class="indent">
  31(1) Subject to subsection (2), evidence that would otherwise be admissible 
  under Canadian law shall be admitted as evidence at an extradition hearing. 
  The following shall also be admitted as evidence, even if it would not otherwise 
  be admissible under Canadian law: </p>
<p class="indent10"> (c) evidence adduced by the person sought for extradition 
  that is relevant to the tests set out in subsection 29(1) if the judge considers 
  it reliable.</p>
<p>
  [28] Counsel for the appellant submitted that the transcript of the victim's 
  testimony was not relevant because the information in the Record of the Case 
  by the United States established that the victim feared for her safety. Counsel 
  contended that as the Extradition Judge was not entitled to weigh evidence on 
  the extradition proceeding, evidence which contradicted that provided in the 
  Record of the Case was irrelevant and therefore inadmissible. Counsel acknowledged 
  in oral argument that this submission depended on the court accepting her primary 
  submission that the Extradition Judge misapprehended the burden of proof under 
  s. 29(1)(b). Counsel acknowledged that if the balance of probabilities standard 
  was applicable, then the transcript of the victim's evidence was relevant 
  in that it contained evidence of the conduct underlying the California charges 
  and in particular, evidence of the victim's state of mind. </p>
<p>
  [29] Having concluded that the balance of probabilities standard is the appropriate 
  onus under s. 29(1)(b), it follows that I find no error in the trial judge's 
  admission of the transcript of the victim's testimony. The conduct underlying 
  the California offence was very much in issue and the transcript, which was 
  admittedly reliable, provided the victim's sworn version of that conduct. 
  </p>
<p> The Reasonableness of the Discharge Order</p>
<p> [30] Section 55(1)(a)(i) of the Act allows this court to set aside a discharge 
  order if that discharge is &quot;unreasonable and cannot be supported by the 
  evidence&quot;. This is the same standard of factual review applied in this 
  court on conviction appeals. The standard is however more difficult for this 
  appellant to meet since, unlike the accused on a conviction appeal, this appellant 
  carried the burden of proof at the extradition hearing. The appellant must show 
  that no reasonable trier of fact would have failed to conclude on the balance 
  of probabilities that the appellant had established the preconditions to extradition 
  set out in s. 29(1)(b) of the Act.</p>
<p>
  [31] I think it can be fairly said that on the entirety of the material, some 
  judges would have come to the conclusion on the balance of probabilities that 
  the victim feared for her safety as a result of the respondent's conduct. 
  Even the victim's evidence, especially taken in combination with her actions 
  at the time of the relevant events, could support a finding that she feared 
  for her safety.</p>
<p>
  [32] This court cannot interfere with the decision made by the Extradition Judge 
  on the basis that a different conclusion could reasonably have been reached. 
  The victim's evidence as to her state of mind is unclear and arguably 
  internally inconsistent. The Extradition Judge focussed on these ambiguities 
  and inconsistencies in determining whether the appellant had satisfied him that 
  the victim feared for her safety at the relevant time. While the conclusion 
  reached by the Extradition Judge may not be the conclusion that I would have 
  reached, I cannot describe that conclusion as unreasonable or unsupported by 
  the evidence. </p>
<p>
  VI</p>
<p>
  [33] For the reasons set out above, the appeal is dismissed. </p>
