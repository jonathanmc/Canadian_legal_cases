<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice Bernard T. Ryan of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice on August 6, 2002.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, Michael Sernoski, was convicted of two counts of attempting 
  to obstruct justice. The first count related to an attempt to confine the complainant, 
  Tara Moore, so that she could not testify as a witness at a trial of the appellant's 
  friend, Richard Roy. The second count related to a letter composed by the appellant 
  and signed by the complainant in which she recanted the substance of her complaints 
  to the police about Mr. Roy.</p>
<p>
  [2] Ms. Moore and Mr. Roy were apparently girlfriend and boyfriend. A police 
  officer happened to encounter Ms. Moore and noted that her face was bloodied 
  and her nose appeared to be broken. Ms. Moore eventually told the police that 
  Mr. Roy had beaten her. An investigation confirmed that an assault had occurred 
  where Ms. Moore said she had been assaulted. Charges were laid against Mr. Roy. 
  Ms. Moore was a most reluctant witness from the outset. The police had difficulty 
  keeping track of Ms. Moore who is a cocaine addict.</p>
<p>
  [3] Ms. Moore made a statement to the police under oath and on videotape in 
  which she indicated that the appellant had taken her to an apartment the night 
  before she was scheduled to testify and kept her under the influence of cocaine 
  until after the court proceedings. At trial, Ms. Moore recanted significant 
  parts of the statement that incriminated the appellant in the alleged confinement. 
  The Crown made a K.G.B. application (R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740) seeking 
  to have the videotaped statement admitted for its truth. After hearing extensive 
  evidence, the trial judge admitted the statement.</p>
<p>
  [4] The complainant continued to testify in the trial proper. Although much 
  of her testimony was confusing, it is fair to say that a good deal of it was 
  inconsistent with what she said about the appellant in her statement.</p>
<p>
  [5] In his decision, the trial judge rejected the complainant's trial testimony: 
  &quot;She had no thought of the fact that she was called upon to tell the truth 
  today. She would have said anything, whatever anybody wanted her to say.&quot;</p>
<p> [6] The trial judge then turned to the evidence of the video statement, as 
  well as the testimony of another witness, David Lessard. He found that the appellant 
  had directed Mr. Lessard to prepare the letter &quot;for the purpose of getting 
  Ms. Moore to sign and in her state, she would have signed anything and she did 
  sign.&quot; He also concluded that the appellant &quot;was certainly instrumental 
  in ensuring that the complainant was not available for trial the next day&quot;. 
  Accordingly, the trial judge convicted the appellant on both counts.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [7] The principal issues on the appeal relate to the complainant's K.G.B. statement. 
  In a very able argument, Mr. Norris, serving as duty counsel for inmate appeals 
  in Kingston, contends that there were two serious problems with this statement: 
  (1) the trial judge's reasons in his ruling admitting the statement are so deficient 
  that they fail the 'sufficiency of reasons' standard enunciated by Binnie J. 
  in R. v. Sheppard, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869; and (2) the statement did not meet the 
  K.G.B. test for admissibility on the merits.</p>
<p>
  (1) The Sheppard issue</p>
<p>
  [8] There is no doubt that the sufficiency of reasons standard from Sheppard 
  applies to rulings made by a judge during a trial, as well as to his reasons 
  for judgment. Indeed, in R. v. Chappell (2003), 172 C.C.C. (3d) 539 at 546, 
  this court held that the Sheppard standard applies to a trial judge's ruling 
  on a K.G.B. application.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant contends that the trial judge failed to address four features 
  that cast doubt on the complainant's statement: (1) her physical and emotional 
  state when she made the statement; (2) her potential motive to lie; (3) her 
  admission during her trial testimony that she lied in her statement; and (4) 
  the absence of a police caution to the complainant about the possible jeopardy 
  she was in when she was brought to the police station.</p>
<p>
  [10] We do not accept these submissions. Although the trial judge's K.G.B. ruling 
  is brief (two pages), it is clear that he was alive to these types of considerations. 
  He discussed the formalities surrounding the taking of the statement, including 
  taking an oath from the complainant and videotaping her statement, and he specifically 
  addressed the complainant's condition at the time she made the statement.</p>
<p>
  (2) The merits of the K.G.B. ruling</p>
<p>
  [11] The appellant concedes that the necessity component of the K.G.B. test 
  was met, since the complainant's trial testimony was inconsistent with her earlier 
  statement to the police. However, relying on this court's recent decision in 
  Chappell, he submits that the reliability component was not established.</p>
<p>
  [12] We disagree. In B. (K.G.), Lamer C.J.C. identified three factors which 
  might enhance the reliability of a previous statement which a witness recants 
  at trial: (1) the statement was made under oath; (2) the statement was videotaped; 
  and (3) the maker of the statement is available to be cross?examined at the 
  trial. All of these factors were present with respect to the complainant's statement. 
  In Chappell, only the third factor was present.</p>
<p>
  [13] The remaining question is whether the contents of the complainant's statement 
  could support the trial judge's finding of guilt on the two charges.</p>
<p>
  [14] With respect to the obstruct/confinement charge, the trial judge explicitly 
  relied on the contents of the complainant's videotaped statement. In our view, 
  that reliance was appropriate. In her statement, the complainant said that the 
  appellant picked her up the day before Roy's trial, took her to an apartment 
  in Hull and told her that she could not leave until he heard from Mr. Roy after 
  court the next day. She also said that she was afraid of the appellant and his 
  friends:</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And while you were at that rooming house in Hull, your comment 
  was that you didn't feel you could leave?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. No.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. No.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And you agree with that?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And you said you didn't feel you could leave because you 
  were - you were scared of what would happen to you, right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And Officer Reynolds asked you why would you do something, 
  why would you listen to somebody who told you to do that and you said because 
  of what they're capable of, right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. &quot;They&quot; being Mr. Roy and his friends, right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And one of his friends is Mr. Sernoski?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: I'm sorry. I didn't hear that.</p>
<p class="indent"> WITNESS: Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And you explained to Officer Reynolds why it is you feared 
  them, right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And you agreed that you were being truthful when you told 
  Officer Reynolds why it is you feared Mr. Roy and his friends?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And specifically you were talking about - about Mr. Sernoski, 
  about Boo, right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p>
  [15] With respect to the &quot;obstruct/letter&quot; charge, it does not appear 
  from his reasons that the trial judge relied on anything the complainant said 
  in her K.G.B. statement. Indeed, it is difficult to determine from the record 
  whether she said anything about the letter in that statement. The trial judge 
  relied on the testimony of another witness, David Lessard, who typed the letter 
  at the appellant's request, and on inferences from that testimony and other 
  circumstances, including the friendship between the appellant and Mr. Roy. The 
  trial judge concluded his brief consideration of this charge with these words:</p>
<p class="indent"> &#133; The defendant [accused] obviously was obtaining the 
  letter for the purposes of getting Ms. Moore to sign and in her state, she would 
  have signed anything and she did sign.</p>
<p>
  [16] The trial judge did not refer to the actual language of the charge. The 
  Crown alleged an attempt to obstruct justice &quot;by forcing Tara Moore to 
  sign a statement recanting her evidence&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [17] Based on the language used in the charge, it would appear that the essence 
  of the attempt to obstruct justice lies in the use of force to obtain recantation. 
  The only evidence as to how the recantation came about came from Ms. Moore. 
  She did not suggest that she was forced to sign the recantation. Quite to the 
  contrary, she testified that the statement was her idea. While the trial judge 
  rejected this evidence along with the rest of Ms. Moore's testimony, that rejection 
  cannot provide a basis upon which to find that she was in fact forced to sign 
  the statement. In our view, there is no evidence from which it could reasonably 
  be inferred that Ms. Moore was forced to sign the statement.</p>
<p>
  [18] It may be suggested that our reading of the information is unduly narrow 
  and that the essence of the attempt to obstruct justice is the procuring of 
  a false recantation. We do not think that the words of the charge bear this 
  reading. However, even if they did, it would be incumbent on the Crown to prove 
  that the appellant knew that the recantation was false: R. v. Savinkoff (1962), 
  39 C.R. 306 (B.C.C.A.). While there was evidence from which the trial judge 
  could conclude that the recantation was false, there was no credible evidence 
  upon which it could be reasonably inferred that the appellant knew the statement 
  was false.</p>
<p>
  [19] We would dismiss the appeal on the obstruct/confinement charge (count 1) 
  and would allow the appeal on the obstruct/letter charge (count 2), quash the 
  conviction and enter an acquittal.</p>

<hr style="height: 1px; color: #000000">
<p><a name="1"></a>[<a href="#r1">1]</a> The trial judge acquitted the appellant 
  on a third count, forcible confinement. Although there was a similarity in the 
  facts giving rise to counts 1 and 3 (which the trial judge acknowledged), the 
  appellant does not advance as a ground of appeal that the verdicts on these 
  two counts were inconsistent.</p>
