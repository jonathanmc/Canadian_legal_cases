<p>The appellant, Michael Lee Shady, appeals against the conviction imposed by 
  Justice Thomas G. Zuber of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, 
  dated November 17, 2000. </p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant Shady was tried before Zuber J. with a jury. He was convicted 
  of one count of sexual assault and acquitted of one count of break and enter 
  with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely sexual assault. He was sentenced 
  to 90 days intermittent custody with one year probation. He appeals against 
  his conviction only. </p>
<p>
  [2] All of the appellant's submissions relate to the trial judge's charge to 
  the jury. A brief outline of the evidence will therefore suffice to put the 
  issues raised in this appeal in context.</p>
<p>
  [3] At trial, the 15 year old complainant testified that the appellant sexually 
  assaulted her after a party that she and her brother held at their residence 
  on July 18, 1999, while their parents were absent. According to the complainant, 
  she was asleep in her parents' bedroom after the party when she was awakened 
  by the appellant who had his hand over her mouth and his penis exposed. He attempted 
  to pull her head towards his penis but she resisted. She said the appellant 
  then had forcible intercourse with her. After attempting to calm the appellant 
  down by smoking a cigarette in the backyard, the complainant alleges that she 
  was again sexually assaulted by the appellant, this time in her bedroom, when 
  they entered the home again. </p>
<p>
  [4] According to the appellant, he had been involved in an ongoing sexual relationship 
  with the complainant prior to the events. On the night of the party, the appellant 
  testified that the complainant invited him to return to her house for a sexual 
  liaison after driving his friends home. When he returned, to his surprise he 
  found the back door locked. He, therefore, knocked on the window of the complainant's 
  bedroom and she allowed him into the house. The two proceeded to the complainant's 
  parents' bedroom where they engaged in consensual sexual foreplay. They then 
  went out for a cigarette and returned to the complainant's bedroom where the 
  appellant asked the complainant to perform oral sex on him. After she refused, 
  the appellant performed oral sex on the complainant and engaged in what he said 
  was consensual sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant advances four grounds of appeal with which we propose to deal 
  seriatim.</p>
<p>
  Did the trial judge err in not leaving the defence of honest but mistaken belief 
  in consent with the jury? </p>
<p>
  [6] At the end of the trial the trial judge found that there was no air of reality 
  to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent and the defence counsel 
  was silent. </p>
<p>
  [7] After the jury had been charged, no objection was taken to the charge. </p>
<p>
  [8] During its deliberations the jury returned with questions relating to the 
  incident of oral sex in the complainant's bedroom. The appellant submits that 
  because the jury's questions focussed on the evidence related to oral sex, that 
  at that point it was incumbent on the trial judge to charge the jury on the 
  defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.</p>
<p>
  [9] Whether or not the defence of honest belief in consent should be put to 
  the jury depends on whether there is an air of reality to the defence arising 
  from the evidence. We agree with the trial judge that there was no air of reality 
  to this defence. Further, we are of the opinion that, although the jury focussed 
  on this particular aspect of the evidence in its questions, this does not mean 
  that they have discounted the rest of the evidence relating to the charge. In 
  any event, even considering the evidence relating to oral sex alone the defence 
  of honest but mistaken belief in consent does not arise. </p>
<p>
  Did the trial judge fail to charge the jury sufficiently on the issue of consent?</p>
<p>
  [10] Counsel for the appellant acknowledged in her submission that there was 
  no error insofar as what the trial judge said about consent. The alleged error 
  relates solely to the previous ground of appeal. Hence, this ground must also 
  fail.</p>
<p>
  Were the verdicts inconsistent? </p>
<p>
  [11] In his precharge conference with counsel, the trial judge stated that it 
  was possible that the verdicts might be different with respect to each count. 
  Counsel did not disagree.</p>
<p>
  [12] We see nothing inconsistent about the jury reaching a verdict that reflects 
  their unwillingness to conclude that the appellant committed the offence of 
  break and enter with intent while convicting him for sexual assault. The elements 
  of these offences are entirely different. </p>
<p>
  Did the trial judge err in his charge on reasonable doubt?</p>
<p>
  [13] We see no merit to the submission of the appellant that the trial judge 
  erred in charging the jury on reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [14] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
