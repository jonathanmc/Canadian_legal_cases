<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The appellant raises two issues. First she says that the trial judge erred 
  in attributing some of her testimony to her mental condition without expert 
  evidence. We do not agree. The trial judge was entitled to rely on his assessment 
  of the appellant's credibility including her apparent mental condition and did 
  not require expert evidence for that purpose. The second issue concerns the 
  limitation period. The trial judge had ample evidence to find that the limitation 
  period had expired.</p>    <P>
  [2] The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $4,000 inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
