<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The main witness against the accused was an accomplice. The accused gave 
  evidence and contradicted the accomplice's evidence. In his charge, the trial 
  judge, at pp. 50-51, stated: </p>
<p class="indent">You, as triers of fact, have to decide whom you believe. &#133;You're 
  required to determine if Mr. Kerry W. Shayne's version of the events are true 
  or could reasonably be true.</p>
<p>[2] In our view, notwithstanding that a proper W.D. charge was also given to 
  the jury, this instruction constitutes reversible error. In light of this conclusion, 
  it is unnecessary to deal with the other grounds of appeal.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is set aside, and a 
  new trial ordered.</p>
