<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Ian V. B. Nordheimer of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated October 31, 2000.</p>
<p>WEILER J.A: </p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] Print Three is a franchisor of copying and print stores. Shelanu was a Print 
  Three franchisee owned by Brian Deslauriers and his wife Mary. Shelanu alleged 
  that Print Three breached its obligations as a franchisor and, in addition to 
  claiming damages, alleged that it was entitled to be released from further performance 
  of its obligations as a franchisee from the date it gave notice of termination 
  of the franchise agreement (the &quot;agreement&quot;). Print Three denied any 
  breach of its obligations and counterclaimed for damages. Nordheimer J. held 
  in favour of Shelanu with respect to both damages and fundamental breach and 
  dismissed Print Three's counterclaim. Despite this finding, he assessed the 
  damages under the counterclaim. </p>
<p>
  II. OVERVIEW</p>
<p>
  [2] Print Three's appeal raises three main issues. The first issue is whether 
  the trial judge erred in holding that Print Three breached any of its obligations 
  to Shelanu. In connection with this issue, Print Three alleges that the trial 
  judge erred in holding that it breached an oral agreement entered into after 
  the written franchise agreement. The effect of the oral agreement was to entitle 
  Shelanu to a greater royalty rebate under the agreement. Print Three submits 
  that the oral agreement is unenforceable due to the existence of an entire agreement 
  clause and other clauses excluding oral amendments and waivers not in writing 
  in the agreement (collectively referred to, for ease of reference, as the exclusion 
  clauses) and due to lack of consideration. The second issue is whether the trial 
  judge erred in holding that the parties owed each other a duty of good faith 
  and that Print Three breached that duty by allowing for the establishment of 
  a Le Print Express franchise. If Print Three did breach its obligations to Shelanu, 
  the third issue is whether the breach was so fundamental that Shelanu was released 
  from further performance of the agreement from the date it gave notice of termination 
  of the agreement. </p>
<p>
  [3] In the event that Shelanu was not released from further performance of its 
  obligations as a franchisee, I must consider Shelanu's cross-appeal of the trial 
  judge's assessment of damages under Print Three's counterclaim.</p>
<p>
  [4] With respect to the first issue, based on the twofold approach I adopt, 
  I would hold that the subsequent oral agreement is enforceable despite the existence 
  of the exclusion clauses. First, I determine whether these clauses apply to 
  the subsequent oral agreement and I conclude that they do not. I would also 
  uphold the trial judge's finding that there was consideration for the oral agreement. 
  Second, because the appellant has not appealed the trial judge's finding that 
  the oral agreement exists and there is no dispute as to its terms, I find that 
  the subsequent oral agreement represents the intentions and legitimate expectations 
  of the parties and, in these circumstances, should prevail. </p>
<p>
  [5] With respect to the second issue, the trial judge recognized a common law 
  and statutory duty of good faith between Print Three and Shelanu. I would hold 
  that the trial judge did not err in recognizing the existence of a duty of good 
  faith at common law. For reasons I will specify later, the circumstances giving 
  rise to the duty of good faith that the Supreme Court recognized in the employment 
  context in Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd. (c.o.b. Public Press), [1997] 
  3 S.C.R. 701 are equally present in the franchisor franchisee relationship here. 
  Print Three had a duty of good faith in the sense that it had an obligation 
  to have regard to Shelanu's legitimate interests and to deal promptly, honestly, 
  fairly and reasonably with Shelanu. I would also hold that the trial judge did 
  not impose a higher, fiduciary duty on Print Three.</p>
<p>
  [6] Given my conclusion, it is unnecessary to decide whether the Arthur Wishart 
  Act, (Franchise Disclosure), S.O. 2000 c. 3, which applies to existing franchises, 
  is applicable in this case where the acts in issue took place prior to the coming 
  into force of the Act.</p>
<p>
  [7] I agree with the trial judge that Print Three breached its obligations to 
  Shelanu with respect to payment of royalty rebates and its advertising program. 
  I disagree, however, with the trial judge's conclusion that the establishment 
  of the Le Print Express business was a breach of Print Three's duty of good 
  faith towards Shelanu. The trial judge committed a palpable and overriding error 
  in coming to that conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [8] With respect to the third issue, fundamental breach, having regard to my 
  conclusion that the establishment of the Le Print Express franchise was not 
  a breach of Print Three's obligations towards Shelanu and to the fact that Shelanu 
  continued to derive the benefit of the use of Print Three's name and an exclusive 
  territory after it purported to terminate the agreement, I would hold that the 
  trial judge erred in excusing Shelanu from further performance under the agreement. 
  </p>
<p>
  [9] In relation to the cross appeal respecting damages though I have concluded 
  that Shelanu was not excused from further performance under the agreement, I 
  would hold that the trial judge committed an error in principle in holding Shelanu 
  liable for damages over a period of 10 years, or the life of a franchise agreement. 
  Instead, based on Shelanu's breach of its one-year non-competition clause, I 
  would hold Shelanu liable for damages for one year. I would agree with the trial 
  judge that Shelanu is liable to pay Print Three an amount equal to the loss 
  of one franchise fee namely $64,500 for failing to surrender its customer list, 
  telephone and fax numbers at the end of the agreement. In accordance with the 
  figures used by the trial judge, I would assess the damages to Print Three for 
  loss of revenue and loss of advertising fees for one year at $29,700 in addition 
  to the franchise fee of $64,500 for a total of $94,200. My reasons follow.</p>
<p>
  III. LEGAL ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [10] The decision of the trial judge is reported at [2000] O.J. No. 4129 and, 
  therefore, a brief outline of the facts relating to the alleged breaches will 
  suffice to appreciate the legal arguments and these reasons.</p>
<p>
  1. Enforceability of the Oral Agreement</p>
<p>
  A. Facts</p>
<p>
  [11] In 1987, BCD Print Inc., a company owned by Brian Deslauriers, purchased 
  a Print Three franchise for a location at 239 Bloor Street East in Toronto. 
  BCD is not a party to this action although it is a party to the oral agreement. 
  </p>
<p>
  [12] Two years later, Brian Deslauriers and his wife Mary purchased the shares 
  of Shelanu Inc., which had two Print Three franchises at 60 and 200 Bloor Street 
  West. They entered into two new franchise agreements with Print Three for each 
  of these locations and gave a personal guarantee of the debts of Shelanu. In 
  September 1991, there was a downturn in the economy and, with the oral agreement 
  of Jack Banks, the principal behind Print Three, Shelanu closed the operation 
  at 200 Bloor Street West. Paragraph 26 of the franchise agreement required that 
  any change to the terms or covenants of the agreement be in writing. No such 
  documentation was ever requested or required by Print Three when the 200 Bloor 
  Street West location was closed.</p>
<p>
  [13] Over the next few years, the Deslauriers continued to struggle with their 
  businesses and eventually BCD closed the 239 Bloor Street East location and 
  moved it to 80 Bloor Street West. Pursuant to the written franchise agreement, 
  Print Three was to lease the space but was not interested in doing so. BCD leased 
  the space directly at 80 Bloor Street West and used it as a production facility 
  for Shelanu's business. Print Three did not object. Instead, Banks orally offered 
  to let the Deslauriers surrender BCD's franchise but said that, if they did, 
  he would feel free to put a new franchise in at 239 Bloor Street East. Afraid 
  of the competition, the Deslauriers declined Banks' offer at this time. </p>
<p>
  [14] On January 13, 1995, two years after the closure of the 239 Bloor Street 
  East outlet, the Deslauriers met with Banks and asked him if they could surrender 
  the BCD franchise. (By this time BCD had moved into space at 60 Bloor Street 
  West, above the premises occupied by Shelanu). He agreed but asked that they 
  confirm this agreement with his legal counsel. Three days later, Mary Deslauriers 
  wrote a letter on BCD letterhead as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This is to confirm our discussion of Friday, January 13, 1995, with Jack Banks, 
  that we would like to operate our business as one franchise, that being the 
  franchise located at 60 Bloor St. W. Therefore, we are hereby cancelling our 
  licensing agreement for the franchise formerly located at 239 Bloor Street East 
  (location #73). We will then submit royalties for all revenues on one report. 
  If possible, we would like this change to be effective January 1,1995.</p>
<p>
  [15] The reference to submitting royalties is a reference to Shelanu's obligation 
  to pay Print Three a monthly royalty of 6% of gross sales pursuant to paragraph 
  3 of the franchise agreement. </p>
<p>
  [16] The franchise agreement provided that a percentage of the royalties paid 
  was to be remitted to the franchisee based on the franchisee's aggregate sales 
  each quarter. As certain gross sales levels were met, the percentage of royalties 
  rebated increased. As two franchises, the sales were split between BCD and Shelanu 
  with the result that gross sales levels would be lower for both franchises and, 
  consequently, the percentage royalty rebate owed by Print Three would be lower. 
  Conversely, if Shelanu reported all sales, gross sales levels would be higher 
  and the royalty rebate would be at a higher percentage.</p>
<p>
  [17] In early February 1995, the Deslauriers reported as one franchise, Shelanu, 
  and sent the royalty statement based on sales for the month of January. Charlotte 
  Krebs, a Print Three employee, called Mary Deslauriers and told her that one 
  franchise report was missing. Mary Deslauriers told her of the agreement reached 
  with Banks. Subsequently, Krebs called Mary Deslauriers again and said that 
  Banks might require a new franchise agreement to be signed. Mary Deslauriers 
  was surprised at this and said she would speak to Banks. Although Mary Deslauriers 
  called and left messages for Banks asking why a new agreement would be necessary, 
  he never returned her call, and the question of a new franchise agreement was 
  not raised again. </p>
<p>
  [18] On April 6, 1995 Mary Deslauriers sent a letter to Krebs enclosing Shelanu's 
  royalty cheque for March as one franchise. The letter stated in part: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Since your inquiry, we have left several messages for Jack to see if he has 
  any concerns about this. We have not heard back from him, so we assume that 
  we are and have been since January, one franchise. We are therefore looking 
  forward to a Royalty Rebate for this quarter accordingly. </p>
<p>
  [19] Around this time a dispute arose between Print Three and many of the franchisees 
  regarding advertising. This dispute is the subject of an issue called the Air 
  Miles program that I will discuss later. The fact that the Deslauriers sided 
  with the other franchisees on this issue angered Banks. On May 8, 1995, Banks 
  expressed some of this anger during a telephone conversation with Mary Deslauriers. 
  According to Mary Deslaurier's note, he stated, among other things, &quot;Every 
  franchise that did not pay the 3% for April [for the Air Miles advertising program], 
  Jack [Banks] is going to go after, and he's going to close them down. And he's 
  going to write a letter to us saying that he will never help us out again&#133;&quot; 
  Following this conversation, Banks wrote a letter to the Deslauriers purporting 
  to deny the &quot;request to terminate one of your franchise agreements and 
  to consolidate your two centres&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [20] The quarter following the phone call (July to September 1995) was the first 
  time the royalty rebate was withheld. Print Three also withheld the royalty 
  rebate for the fourth quarter (October to December 1995). </p>
<p>
  [21] The royalty rebates remained an outstanding problem. Print Three also withheld 
  royalty rebates for the second quarter of 1996 without explanation. On October 
  3, 1996, a meeting took place between Bob Davis, a former franchisee who had 
  become president of Print Three, and the Deslauriers to deal with the issue 
  of royalty rebates. Davis asked to see the production facility now located on 
  the twelfth floor of 60 Bloor Street West and Brian Deslauriers refused to show 
  it to him. He wanted to discuss the unpaid rebates. Towards the end of the meeting, 
  Davis handed over a royalty rebate cheque for the royalty rebates due for the 
  second quarter of 1996 apparently on the basis of there being two franchises. 
  On October 7, 1996, the royalty rebates for the third and fourth quarters of 
  1995 were also paid on the basis that there were two franchises. On October 
  8, at Davis' request, Brian Deslauriers sent a letter to Davis again outlining 
  the 1995 agreement he had with Banks. The next day Davis replied, stating they 
  were in breach of the franchise agreement for refusing to allow him to see the 
  production facility, and, as a result, were not entitled to any royalty rebate. 
  The amount of this rebate was $2,241 or $8,947, depending upon whether the January 
  13, 1995 agreement was enforceable (i.e. depending on whether they were reporting 
  as one or two franchises). Brian Deslauriers wrote back saying Davis could see 
  the production facility any time it was convenient for him. This visit took 
  place on January 16, 1996 and lasted only a few minutes. On January 24, 1996, 
  Davis sent a letter to Brian Deslauriers indicating that he had decided he would 
  continue to treat their operation as two stores for rebate purposes.</p>
<p>
  [22] On May 2, 1997, Shelanu wrote a letter alleging a number of breaches of 
  the franchise agreement and purporting to terminate the franchise agreement 
  with Print Three. In August 1997, Shelanu commenced an action against Print 
  Three for royalty rebates it claimed were owing. Despite the litigation, Shelanu 
  continued to remit royalty payments on the basis of one franchise. Shelanu also 
  continued to use the name Print Three on its store until October 16, 1999. The 
  franchise agreement expired naturally in December 1999.</p>
<p>
  [23] Neither Banks nor Krebs testified at trial. </p>
<p>
  B. The Findings of the Trial Judge </p>
<p>[24] Since neither Banks nor Krebs testified, the trial judge inferred that 
  their evidence would not have supported the defence position respecting the 
  lack of any oral agreement. From this inference, and the evidence as a whole, 
  the trial judge found that an oral agreement was reached in January 1995 in 
  which Print Three agreed to cancel BCD's franchise for the 239 Bloor Street 
  East location and to allow BCD to combine its production operations with the 
  retail operations of Shelanu. Because an oral agreement had been reached in 
  January 1995, Banks' letter of May 1995 and Davis' letter in January 1996, unilaterally 
  refusing to treat the production facility and the store at 60 Bloor Street West 
  as one location, had no effect. </p>
<p>
  [25] The trial judge rejected the appellant's argument that the agreement was 
  unenforceable. He found that the defendant did not require any formal written 
  documentation when Shelanu terminated the franchise at the 200 Bloor Street 
  West location or when BCD closed the 239 Bloor Street East location and moved 
  it to 80 Bloor Street West and, consequently, it was not now open to Print Three 
  to insist on strict compliance with its rights under the written agreement.</p>
<p>
  [26] With respect to the issue of consideration, the trial judge found that 
  this was a three party agreement and that there was consideration flowing to 
  Print Three from both BCD and Shelanu. From BCD, Print Three obtained the release 
  of the territory related to the 239 Bloor Street East location that it could 
  then sell to a new franchisee. From Shelanu, Print Three received the benefit 
  of Shelanu's improved financial situation. Presumably, the trial judge meant 
  that Print Three received the benefit of increased royalties from Shelanu resulting 
  from its increased sales which, in turn, were derived from the synergies of 
  combining BCD's and Print Three's operations into one. On the issue of privity, 
  the trial judge found that the representatives of both BCD and Shelanu, the 
  Deslauriers, were present with Print Three's representative, Banks, at the meeting 
  where the agreement was reached. He saw no reason why Shelanu one of the parties 
  to the agreement and its principal beneficiary could not enforce it. </p>
<p>
  [27] The evidence respecting the making of the oral agreement and its existence 
  were explored extensively at trial. On appeal, the appellant accepts the finding 
  of the trial judge that there was an oral agreement in January 1995, but submits 
  that the trial judge erred in law in holding that this oral agreement was enforceable.</p>
<p>
  [28] The paragraphs in the written franchise agreement which the appellant submits 
  are contrary to the oral agreement are paragraph 20 (delay in exercising a right 
  or breach of default is not waiver of right), paragraph 26 (no waiver, amendment 
  or change of any terms unless signed by all parties) and paragraph 27 (this 
  [written] agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with 
  respect to all matters herein).</p>
<p>
  [29] Simply put, the appellant's position is that the parties' bargain is to 
  be equated with the document they have signed. </p>
<p>
  C. Analysis</p>
<p>i.) Exclusion Clauses: Interpretive Approach</p>
<p>
  [30] Before deciding not to enforce the exclusion clauses, the trial judge did 
  not specifically consider whether they applied to the oral agreement. This seems 
  to me to be a necessary first step. Once a determination has been made that 
  the exclusion clauses apply, the court can then consider whether they should 
  be enforced. </p>
<p>
  [31] Paragraphs 20, 26, and 27 are not limitation or exclusion clauses in the 
  traditional sense that they limit or exclude liability for damages for breach 
  of contract or for a tort connected to the contract. Their purpose is, rather, 
  to limit the parties' duties to each other to what has been reduced to writing 
  and, as a corollary, to exclude any other duties. More specifically, an entire 
  agreement clause seeks to exclude liability for statements other than those 
  set out in the written contract and is sometimes referred to as an exclusion 
  clause. See H.G. Beale et al., eds. Chitty on Contracts, 28th ed. (London: Sweet 
  &amp; Maxwell, 1999), vol. 1 at 12-102; Kenyon, Son &amp; Craven Ltd. v. Baxter 
  Hoare &amp; Co. Ltd., [1971] 1 W.L.R. 519 (Q.B.) at 522; Betker v. Williams 
  (1991), 86 D.L.R. (4th) 395 ( B.C.C.A.); Zippy Print Enterprises Ltd. v. Pawliuk 
  (1994), 100 B.C.L.R. (2d) 55 (C.A.). Further, in construing an entire agreement 
  clause, in Beer v. Townsgate I Ltd. (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 136 at 147 (C.A.) this 
  court resorted to the reasoning typically associated with an exclusion clause 
  that limits liability for damages.</p>
<p>
  [32] The approach that I am adopting here is consistent with the approach to 
  construing and enforcing exclusion or limitation clauses relating to damages 
  as stated in Hunter Engineering Co. v. Syncrude Canada Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 
  426. Dickson C.J., with whom La Forest J. concurred, held that exclusion clauses 
  are not inherently unreasonable. In construing an exclusion clause, the issue 
  to be addressed is whether, as a matter of construction, the exclusion clause 
  covers the alleged occurrence or breach in question. Exclusion clauses are to 
  be approached with the aid of the cardinal rules of contractual construction: 
  they must be read contra proferentem and clear words are necessary for the exclusion 
  clause to apply. See Photo Production Ltd. v. Securicor Transport Ltd., [1980] 
  A.C. 827 (H.L.) per Lord Wilberforce at 846, cited by Dickson C.J. at 458-459 
  of his judgment.</p>
<p>
  [33] When the exclusion clause covers the alleged occurrence or breach, the 
  question is whether to enforce the exclusion clause. Where the court is of the 
  opinion extreme unfairness would result from the enforcement of an exclusion 
  clause, such as, for example, where there was inequality of bargaining power, 
  this concern should be addressed directly through the doctrine of unconscionability. 
  Dickson C.J. held that courts should no longer use the term fundamental breach 
  to avoid the operation of an exclusion clause as this term is confusing. The 
  approach of directly addressing the concerns respecting enforcement of the exclusion 
  clause would allow the courts to focus expressly on the real grounds for refusing 
  to enforce a contractual term agreed to by the parties. </p>
<p>
  [34] The other major opinion in Hunter Engineering, supra, is that of Wilson 
  J. with whom L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; J. concurred. Wilson J. held that the court's 
  responsibility did not end with construing the contract to ascertain the bargain 
  that the parties had made. She was of the opinion that the court had a responsibility 
  to assess the reasonableness of enforcing the exclusion clause in the contract 
  in light of subsequent events. The doctrine of unconscionability did not suffice 
  to relieve a party from the effect of an exclusion clause that operated unfairly 
  because it was traditionally restricted to inequality of bargaining power and 
  the circumstances existing at the time the contract was made: See Hunter Engineering, 
  supra, at pp. 511-518. See also N. Rafferty, &quot;Developments in Contract 
  and Tort Law: The 1999-2000 Term&quot; (2000) 13 S.C.L.R. (2d) 125 at 141-143. 
  </p>
<p>
  [35] In Guarantee Co. of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp., [1999] 3 S.C.R. 
  423, the Supreme Court of Canada &quot;&#133;interpreted Hunter Engineering 
  in such a way as to indicate that there was little distinction between the approaches 
  of Dickson C.J. and Wilson J.&quot; respecting the enforceability of exclusion 
  clauses: Rafferty, supra, at 143. I agree. At paragraph 52 of the reasons in 
  Gordon Capital, supra, Iacobucci and Bastarache JJ. stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The only limitation placed upon enforcing the contract as written &#133;. would 
  be to refuse to enforce an exclusion of liability in circumstances where to 
  do so would be unconscionable, according to Dickson C.J., or unfair, unreasonable 
  or otherwise contrary to public policy, according to Wilson J. </p>
<p>
  [36] With this framework for contractual interpretation in mind, I will now 
  turn to the agreements in issue with a view to determining whether the paragraphs 
  in issue apply to the oral agreement. </p>
<p>
  ii.) Does the Tripartite Oral Agreement Conflict with the Wording of the Exclusion 
  Clauses in the Franchise Agreement? </p>
<p>
  [37] Paragraph 3B of the agreement requires the franchise owner to pay a continuing 
  royalty amounting to six percent of all monthly gross sales for the use of the 
  franchisor's on-going assistance, trademarks and know-how. Regardless of whether 
  Shelanu operated as one franchise or as two, it had to pay Print Three six percent 
  of all monthly gross sales. It was in relation to the royalty rebate provided 
  for in the agreement that the dispute arose. In this regard the wording of the 
  agreement is again instructive. Paragraph 3C states that the rebate on quarterly 
  gross sales from $81,501 to 135,850 is 33 and 1/3%. On sales between $135,851 
  and $190,190, the rebate is 66 and 2/3%, and on sales over $190,191 it is 100%. 
  The next relevant sentence is: </p>
<p class="indent"> The foregoing royalty rebate calculation assumes Franchise 
  Owner has just one (1) location. </p>
<p class="indent">If the franchisee has two locations, gross sales must attain 
  $163,001 before the rebate of 33 1/3% of gross sales is payable [emphasis added]. 
</p>
<p>
  [38] Paragraph 5 requires the franchise owner to operate only at the location 
  specified in the agreement. The address indicated for Shelanu's approved location 
  is 60 Bloor Street West, Toronto, Ontario. With respect to Shelanu's franchise 
  agreement, nothing changed in January 1995; it was operating as a single franchise 
  out of a single location, namely 60 Bloor Street West. Consistent with the oral 
  agreement reached with Jack Banks on January 13, 1995, BCD had canceled its 
  franchise with Print Three. BCD effectively merged with Shelanu; however, Shelanu's 
  franchise did not change. It continued to operate as a single franchise under 
  the terms of the franchise agreement. The oral agreement reached was not inconsistent 
  with paragraph 5.</p>
<p>
  [39] I will now consider whether the paragraphs in issue are inconsistent with 
  the alleged oral agreement. </p>
<p>
  [40] Paragraph 20 states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  No delay or omission to exercise a right, power or remedy accruing to one party 
  on any breach or default of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of 
  such right, power or remedy of said party nor will it prevent Franchisor from 
  thereafter enforcing strict compliance with any and all of the terms and conditions 
  herein set forth.</p>
<p>
  [41] The words &quot;right, power or remedy&quot; are not used in a vacuum but 
  relate to &quot;any breach or default of this Agreement&quot;. Paragraph 20 
  has no application because Shelanu was not in breach of its agreement and because 
  paragraph 20 does not apply to the three party oral agreement that was reached. 
  It applies only to &quot;this Agreement&quot;, that is, the written franchise 
  agreement between Print Three and Shelanu. </p>
<p>
  [42] The appellant also relies on paragraphs 26 and 27 of the franchise agreement 
  between Shelanu and Print Three. Paragraph 26 is as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  No waiver, amendment or change of any of the terms or covenants of this Agreement 
  or non-compliance therewith, shall be binding or effective unless effected by 
  a notice signed by any and all parties hereto. The Franchise Owner shall execute 
  such further and other documents, including, without limitation a registered 
  user agreement in respect of the Mark, as may be required from time to time, 
  by the franchisor, to carry out the full intent and purpose of this Agreement.</p>
<p>
  [43] Again the words, &quot;waiver amendment or change&quot; are not used in 
  a vacuum. They are tied to &quot;any of the terms or covenants of this Agreement&quot;. 
  Shelanu owned one franchise and there was no change in its obligations relating 
  to the terms or covenants of that agreement. This is indirectly acknowledged 
  in paragraph 36 of the appellant's factum which states, &quot;Nothing about 
  Print Three observing or not observing the January 13, 1995 Agreement could 
  be a breach of Shelanu's Franchise Agreement&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [44] The oral agreement would only be enforceable if it was valid and binding 
  on all three parties, including BCD. BCD's written franchise agreement with 
  Print Three contained the same wording as Shelanu's. In considering the enforceability 
  of the tri-partite agreement I will also therefore consider whether the exclusion 
  paragraphs applied to BCD. Paragraph 20 of the written agreement between BCD 
  and Print Three also applies only to the two parties and would not apply to 
  the three party oral agreement that was reached. I turn now to consider whether, 
  as against BCD, the words, &quot;waiver, amendment or change&quot; in paragraph 
  26 would apply. The surrender of the franchise was not a waiver or amendment 
  to BCD's franchise agreement as both these words envisage the continuation of 
  some aspect of the franchise agreement and not, as is the case here, its surrender 
  and termination by agreement of the parties. As Cory J. held in Schmidt v. Air 
  Products of Canada Ltd., [1994] 2 S.C.R. 611 at para. 66 in concluding that 
  a power to amend a trust did not include the power to revoke it, &quot;&#133;amendment 
  means change not cancellation which the word revocation connotes.&quot; Similarly, 
  in this case, we are dealing with a revocation of a franchise licence, not an 
  amendment or change to the licence. Further, in interpreting the Patent Act, 
  R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, in Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents), 
  [2002] S.C.J. No. 77, at para. 161, McLachlin C.J.C. on behalf of the majority, 
  stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is a well-known principle of statutory interpretation that the meaning of 
  questionable words or phrases in a statute may be ascertained by reference to 
  the meaning of the words or phrases associated with them (P.-A. C&ocirc;t&eacute;, 
  The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (3rd ed. 2000), at pp. 313-14.).Also, 
  a collective term that completes an enumeration is often restricted to the same 
  genus as those words, even though the collective term may ordinarily have a 
  much broader meaning (at p. 315). </p>
<p>
  [45] The principles which govern the interpretation of contracts are essentially 
  the same as for statutory interpretation: River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson 
  (1877), 2 App. Cos. 743 (H.L.) at 763-765 adopted by L'Heureux Dub&eacute; J. 
  in dissent but not on this point in Manulife Bank of Canada v. Conlin, [1996] 
  3 S.C.R. 415 at para. 40 and also Manitoba (Hydro-Electric Board) v. John Ziglio 
  Co., [1999] M.J. #506 (C.A.). Applying these principles of interpretation to 
  the phrase, &quot;waiver, amendment or change&quot; in this case, the word change 
  would be construed as including a change that would nevertheless result in the 
  continuation of the agreement not, as here, its revocation and termination. 
  The paragraph does not contemplate what occurred pursuant to the oral agreement, 
  namely, a surrender and revocation of the franchise for 239 Bloor Street East 
  by mutual agreement. Paragraph 26 in BCD's agreement does not conflict with 
  the oral agreement. </p>
<p>
  [46] Paragraph 27 of the agreement reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with respect 
  to all of the matters herein and its execution has not been induced by, nor 
  do any of the parties hereto rely upon or regard as material, any representation 
  or right not incorporated herein. Any representations, inducements, promises, 
  and agreements, oral or otherwise not contained herein shall have no force or 
  effect in the construction of the rights and obligations of the parties created 
  by this Agreement.</p>
<p>
  [47] Paragraph 27 deals &quot;with... all of the matters herein&quot; and states 
  that any oral or other representations have no force or effect in the &quot;construction 
  of the rights and obligations of the parties created by this Agreement&quot;. 
  The rights and obligations of the parties to the oral agreement, namely, BCD, 
  Shelanu and Print Three are, as I have said, not &quot;matters herein&quot; 
  and were not &quot;created&quot; by the franchise agreement between Shelanu 
  and Print Three or, for that matter, BCD and Print Three. </p>
<p>
  [48] Further, the ordinary meaning of the language used in paragraph 27 is that 
  the written agreement represented the entire agreement between the parties at 
  the time it was signed. J. Beatson, in Anson's Law of Contract, 27th ed. (Oxford: 
  Oxford University Press, 1998) at 494-95 states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A simple contract, &#133; whether in writing or not, may be varied by a subsequent 
  agreement either written or oral. This in no way conflicts with the rule that 
  extrinsic evidence is not admissible to vary or add to the contents of the written 
  document, for that principle merely refers to the ascertainment of the original 
  intention of the parties [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [49] Indeed, an exception to the parol evidence rule is the existence of any 
  subsequent oral agreement to rescind or modify a written contract provided that 
  the agreement is not invalid under the Statute of Frauds: Ellis v. Abell, [1884] 
  10 O.A.R. 226 at para. 85.</p>
<p>
  [50] Clauses such as the entire agreement clause in issue here are normally 
  used to try to exclude representations made prior to the signing of the written 
  agreement. See P.M. Perell, &quot;A Riddle Inside an Enigma: The Entire Agreement 
  Clause&quot; (1998) The Advocates' Q. 287. Nothing in paragraph 27 suggests 
  that an oral agreement to surrender the franchise several years later would 
  be of no effect. It cannot be said the entire agreement clause was clearly intended 
  to cover any and all future contractual relations between Shelanu and Print 
  Three. See Turner v. Visscher Holdings, [1996] B.C.J. No. 998 (B.C.C.A.). The 
  fact that Print Three and Shelanu entered into and acted upon an oral agreement 
  respecting the surrender of the franchise at 200 Bloor Street West indicates 
  this was not the case. Indeed, J.M. Perillo, ed., Corbin on Contracts (St. Paul, 
  MN: Western Publishing Co., 1993) states at para. 1295 that an express provision 
  in a written contract forbidding oral variation of the terms of a contract or 
  its discharge is generally unsuccessful with respect to subsequent agreements. 
  The reason he gives is that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Two contractors cannot by mutual agreement limit their power to control their 
  legal relations by future mutual agreement. Nor can they in this manner prescribe 
  new rules of evidence and procedure in the proof of facts and events. </p>
<p>
  [51] Paragraph 27 has no application either. </p>
<p>
  [52] The wording of the exclusion paragraphs does not conflict with the subsequent 
  tri-partite oral agreement of January 13, 1995 and does not prevent effect being 
  given to this oral agreement. </p>
<p>
  (iii) Discretion not to enforce the exclusion clauses</p>
<p>
  [53] In view of my conclusion above it is not strictly necessary for me to address 
  the enforceability of the exclusion clauses. However, given the trial judge's 
  conclusion and the extent of argument on the question of whether he erred in 
  refusing to give effect to the clauses, I will consider this issue. </p>
<p>
  [54] At the trial, the existence of the oral agreement and thus the intention 
  of the parties was in issue. The trial judge relied on the parties' subsequent 
  course of conduct to infer that they did not intend to continue to be bound 
  by the exclusion clauses in the agreement. The trial judge found that Print 
  Three had orally agreed to the surrender of a franchise by Shelanu on a previous 
  occasion, and had allowed Shelanu to change locations and to lease space directly 
  without anything being in writing. Where the parties have, by their subsequent 
  course of conduct, amended the written agreement so that it no longer represents 
  the intention of the parties, the court will refuse to enforce the written agreement. 
  This is so even in the face of a clause requiring changes to the agreement to 
  be in writing. See Colautti Construction Ltd. v. City of Ottawa (1984), 9 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 265 (Ont. C.A.), per Cory J.A. </p>
<p>
  [55] On appeal, the appellant has conceded the existence of the oral agreement 
  and its terms but asks this court to enforce the written agreement instead. 
  That submission, in effect, asks this court not to give effect to the intention 
  of the parties. Such a submission is contrary to the classical theory of contract 
  interpretation which emphasizes that courts should ascertain and give effect 
  to the intention of the parties: R. Sullivan, &quot;Contract Interpretation 
  in Practice and Theory&quot; (2000) 13 S.C.L.R. (2d) 369. </p>
<p>
  [56] Sullivan states, at 378, that, &quot;if a conflict arises between the intention 
  of the parties as inferred from the totality of the evidence on the one hand 
  and the meaning of the text on the other, intention should win.&quot; Professor 
  Waddams has also argued that if a party knows or has reason to know that a written 
  contract on which that party relies does not represent the intention of the 
  other party, it should not be enforced. See S.M. Waddams, The Law of Contracts, 
  3rd ed. (Toronto: Canada Law Book, 1993) at paras. 328-329. </p>
<p>
  [57] The rationale of Sullivan and Waddams is similar, namely, that in addition 
  to certainty, legal values such as fairness, equity and justice underlie contractual 
  interpretation and enforcement. Before the court allows the coercive power of 
  the state to be used to serve the private interests of a party to a contract, 
  the court will want to ensure that the contract does not offend these legal 
  values.</p>
<p>
  [58] I would also note that the agreement that we are dealing with is a franchise 
  agreement. A franchise agreement is a type of contract of adhesion, that is, 
  a type of contract whose main provisions are presented on a &quot;take it or 
  leave it basis&quot;. In such situations, the case for holding that an exclusion 
  clause represents the intention of the signer and that the signer should be 
  bound by it is weaker because there is usually an inherent inequality of bargaining 
  power between the parties. See Waddams, supra, at para. 342. Examples of cases 
  involving contracts of adhesion where this Court has refused to apply an exclusion 
  clause because it did not accord with the intention or reasonable expectations 
  of the parties include: Beer v. Townsgate I, supra, Solway v. Davis Moving &amp; 
  Storage Inc. (c.o.b. Kennedy Moving Systems), [2002] O.J. No. 4760 (C.A.) at 
  para. 21 and Zurich Insurance Company v. 686234 Ontario Ltd., [2002] O.J. No. 
  4496 (C.A.). See also Mellco Developments Ltd. v. Portage la Prairie (City), 
  [2002] M.J. No. 381 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [59] Enforcing an exclusion clause that is contrary to the reasonable expectation 
  and understanding of the parties in these circumstances would not be fair or 
  reasonable and would also come within the exception enunciated in Gordon Capital, 
  supra. </p>
<p>
  [60] I would hold that even if the exclusion clauses applied, the trial judge 
  was entitled to refuse to enforce paragraphs 20, 26, and 27 of the agreement. 
  </p>
<p>
  (iv) Consideration </p>
<p>
  [61] I also agree with the trial judge's conclusion that there was consideration 
  for the oral agreement. BCD provided consideration by giving up its territory. 
  Shelanu provided consideration by promising to report the joint earnings of 
  itself and BCD, thereby agreeing to pay the six per cent royalty on higher sales. 
  Rather than having two franchises that were in financial difficulty, Print Three 
  gained the benefit of one healthy franchise and the peace of mind and greater 
  financial certainty of royalties in difficult economic times that brought. The 
  consideration from Print Three was its promise to allow Shelanu to merge BCD's 
  sales with its sales and to report them as one. </p>
<p> [62] For these reasons, I would hold that the trial judge did not err in finding 
  that Shelanu was entitled to enforce the three party oral agreement against 
  Print Three. Print Three breached its obligation to pay Shelanu the royalty 
  rebate in accordance with the oral agreement and, therefore, is liable for damages 
  as found by the trial judge. </p>
<p>
  2. The Duty of Good Faith and Fiduciary Duty</p>
<p>
  [63] The trial judge found that the appellant owed the respondent a duty of 
  good faith either under The Arthur Wishart Act, supra, or at common law. Having 
  regard to my conclusions regarding good faith, set out below, it is unnecessary 
  to decide whether the Arthur Wishart Act, which applies to existing franchises, 
  is applicable in this case where the acts in issue took place prior to the coming 
  into force of the Act.</p>
<p>
  A. Circumstances Giving Rise to a Duty of Good Faith</p>
<p>
  [64] In Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd. (c.o.b. Public Press), [1997] 3 
  S.C.R. 701, the majority of the Supreme Court was prepared to recognize a good 
  faith obligation in employment contracts. Indeed, at paras. 91-95, Iacobucci 
  J. held that contracts of employment have unique characteristics that set them 
  apart from ordinary commercial contracts. He described three special characteristics 
  of employment contracts: 1) the formation of the contract is not the result 
  of the exercise of bargaining power between two equals; 2) the person in the 
  weaker position is unable to achieve more favorable contractual terms because 
  of, for example, that person's inability to access information; 3) the power 
  imbalance continues to affect other facets of the relationship after the contract 
  has been entered into.</p>
<p>
  [65] In some instances a duty of good faith may arise ordinarily out of the 
  nature of the relationship, or the circumstances created by the other party: 
  see 978011 Ontario Ltd. v. Cornell Engineering Co. (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 783 
  (C.A.) at para. 35. </p>
<p>
  [66] The relative position of the parties as outlined by Iacobucci J. in Wallace 
  also exists in the typical franchisor franchisee relationship. First, it is 
  unusual for a franchisee to be in the position of being equal in bargaining 
  power to the franchisor: See Kentucky Fried Chicken Canada, a Division of Pepsi 
  Cola Canada Ltd. v. Scott's Food Services Inc. (1998), 114 O.A.G. 357 (C.A.), 
  per Goudge J.A. at para 16; Machias v. Mr. Submarine Ltd., [2002] O.J. No. 1261 
  (S.C.J.) at para. 109. The second characteristic, inability to negotiate more 
  favourable terms, is met by the fact that a franchise agreement is a contract 
  of adhesion. As I have indicated, a contract of adhesion is a contract in which 
  the essential clauses were not freely negotiated but were drawn up by one of 
  the parties on its behalf and imposed on the other. Further, insofar as access 
  to information is concerned, the franchisee is dependent on the franchisor for 
  information about the franchise, its location and projected cash flow, and is 
  typically required to take a training program devised by the franchisor. The 
  third characteristic, namely that the relationship continues to be affected 
  by the power imbalance, is also met by the fact the franchisee is required to 
  submit to inspections of its premises and audits of its books on demand, to 
  comply with operation bulletins, and, often is dependent on, or required to 
  buy, equipment or product from the franchisor. It is hardly surprising, therefore, 
  that a number of courts, including the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Imasco Retail 
  Inc. (c.o.b. Shoppers Drug Mart) v. Blanaru, [1995] 9 W.W.R. 44 (Man Q.B.), 
  aff'd, [1997] 2 W.W.R. 295 (C.A.) have recognized that a duty of good faith 
  exists at common law in the context of a franchisor-franchisee relationship 
  </p>
<p>
  B. Whether the trial judge held Print Three to a fiduciary duty</p>
<p>
  [67] The appellant submits that the trial judge held Print Three to a higher 
  standard than that imposed by the duty of good faith, namely, the duty of a 
  fiduciary. The appellant's submission that the trial judge applied a fiduciary 
  standard to Print Three rests on the trial judge's comment that the relationship 
  of franchisor to franchisee is akin to a partnership. The appellant states partners 
  owe each other a fiduciary duty and that this is the standard that he applied 
  to Print Three's relationship with Shelanu. </p>
<p>
  [68] The imposition of a duty of good faith and a fiduciary duty are closely 
  related. As stated in Cornell, supra at para. 33 they, along with the standard 
  of unconscionability: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [a]re points on a continuum in which the law acknowledges a limitation on the 
  principle of self-reliance and imposes an obligation to respect the interests 
  of the other. They are defined by P. Finn, &quot;The Fiduciary Principle&quot; 
  in T. Youdan, ed., Equity, Fiduciaries and Trusts,(1989), 1 at 4 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &quot;Unconscionability&quot; accepts that one party is entitled as of course 
  to act self-interestedly in his actions towards the other. Yet in deference 
  to that other's interests, it then proscribes excessively self-interested or 
  exploitative conduct. &quot;Good faith,&quot; while permitting a party to act 
  self-interestedly, nonetheless qualifies this by positively requiring that party, 
  in his decision and action, to have regard to the legitimate interests therein 
  of the other. The &quot;fiduciary&quot; standard for its part enjoins one party 
  to act in the interests of the other -- to act selflessly and with undivided 
  loyalty. There is, in other words, a progression from the first to the third: 
  from selfish behaviour to selfless behaviour. Much the most contentious of the 
  trio is the second, &quot;good faith.&quot; It often goes unacknowledged. It 
  does embody characteristics to be found in the other two [footnotes omitted].</p>
<p>[69] There is at least one important difference between the duty of good faith 
  and a fiduciary duty. If, for example, A owes a fiduciary duty to B, A must 
  act only in accordance with B's interests when A exercises its powers or exercises 
  a discretion arising out of the relationship: see York Condominium Corp. No. 
  167 et al. v. Newrey Holdings Ltd. et al. (1981), 122 D.L.R. (3d) 280 (Ont. 
  C.A.) at 289, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused [1981] 
  1 S.C.R. xi; Hodgkinson v. Simms, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 371. If, on the other hand, 
  A owes a duty of good faith to B, A must give consideration to B's interests 
  as well as to its own interests before exercising its power. Thus, if A owes 
  a duty of good faith to B, so long as A deals honestly and reasonably with B, 
  B's interests are not necessarily paramount: see for example Mason v. Freedman, 
  [1958] S.C.R. 483. </p>
<p>
  [70] The trial judge recognized that the relationship between a franchisor and 
  a franchisee would not normally be characterized as a fiduciary one in accordance 
  with Jirna Ltd. v. Mister Donut of Canada Ltd., [1972] 1 O.R. 251 (C.A.), aff'd, 
  [1975] 1 S.C.R. 2. I do not agree that it logically follows from the trial judge's 
  reference to partners that he applied the fiduciary standard in this case. At 
  a later point in his reasons, the trial judge reiterated that a franchise relationship 
  was akin to that of a partnership and, accordingly, like a partnership required 
  mutual respect. He quoted from the decision of Kelly J. in Gateway Realty Ltd. 
  v. Arton Holdings Ltd. (1991), 106 N.S.R. (2d) 180 (Sup. Ct.) at 191-192, aff'd 
  (1992), 112 N.S.R. (2d) 180 (C.A.), to the effect that parties to a contract 
  are required to exercise their rights under that agreement honestly, fairly, 
  and in good faith, and that, when a party acts contrary to community standards 
  of honesty and reasonableness or fairness, he acts in bad faith. The trial judge 
  well knew the distinction between a duty of good faith and a fiduciary duty 
  and did not hold Print Three to a fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>
  [71] Moreover, the fact that contractual terms are ultimately complied with, 
  does not mean that there has been no breach of the duty of good faith. </p>
<p>C. Breaches of Print Three's obligations as found by the trial judge</p>
<p>[72] The trial judge found that Print Three breached its duty of good faith 
  towards Shelanu in four respects. The specific breaches found by the trial judge 
  are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Print Three's attempts to rescind the May 1995 agreement were not only a 
    breach of that agreement but, in the circumstances, evinced a lack of good 
    faith dealing by the franchisor;</li>
  <li>Print Three unilaterally changed the terms and conditions upon which the 
    franchisees agreed to participate in the Air Miles program, and in so doing, 
    breached the representations made and acted upon by Shelanu;</li>
  <li>Print Three failed to make prompt payment of several royalty rebates and 
    its refusal to pay a royalty rebate for the fourth quarter of 1996; and</li>
  <li>Print Three's establishment of the Le Print Express system, &quot;not only 
    would but did take work and customers from existing Print Three franchises.&quot; 
    As a consequence he held that, &quot;&#133; the establishment of such an enterprise 
    by the very person who owned and controlled the defendant was fundamentally 
    at odds with the defendant's obligations, including the obligation to deal 
    in good faith, to its franchisees.&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p>
  [73] In relation to the first three breaches, the trial judge awarded damages 
  for breach of contract. He did not award separate damages for breach of the 
  duty of good faith. No damages were awarded for the establishment of the Le 
  Print Express franchise. The breaches, including his finding respecting the 
  establishment of the Le Print Express franchise, led the trial judge to conclude 
  that Print Three did not intend to honour or be bound by the commitments it 
  had made to its franchisees and that, as a result, Shelanu should be discharged 
  from any further obligation under the contract.</p>
<p>
  [74] Whether or not a party under a duty of good faith has breached that duty 
  will depend on all the circumstances of the case, including whether the party 
  subject to a duty of good faith conducted itself fairly throughout the process.

<p>
  3. Breaches of Print Three's Obligations to Shelanu</p>
<p>
  A. Royalty Rebates</p>
<p>
  i.) Refusal to recognize the 1995 oral agreement </p>
<p>
  [75] I have already dealt with the facts and findings of the trial judge in 
  relation to the 1995 oral agreement and have held that Print Three breached 
  that agreement. </p>
<p>
  [76] Where a duty of good faith exists, not every breach of contract will be 
  a breach of the duty of good faith. An honest disagreement concerning the interpretation 
  of a franchise agreement ultimately decided in favour of the franchisee could 
  be a breach of contract but need not be a breach of the duty of good faith owed 
  by the franchisor. Denial of payment under an agreement should not, however, 
  be made in order to gain leverage or bargaining advantage in a dispute with 
  the other party or out of vindictiveness. In this case the evidence indicates 
  that Print Three's refusal to pay Shelanu the royalty rebate pursuant to the 
  oral agreement was linked to Banks' anger concerning Shelanu's position respecting 
  the Air Miles advertising program. There was evidence upon which the trial judge 
  could hold that the refusal to recognize the 1995 oral agreement was also a 
  breach of the duty of good faith.</p>
<p>
  ii.) Delay in payment of undisputed royalty rebates </p>
<p>
  [77] Print Three withheld all royalty rebates payable to Shelanu for the third 
  and fourth quarters of 1995 (July to September 1995 and October to December 
  1995). All royalty rebates for April to June 1996 were also withheld but that 
  portion about which there was no dispute was paid when Bob Davis met with Shelanu 
  in October 1996. Similarly, the rebates for 1995 were paid in September. No 
  explanation was given for the delay in paying that portion of the royalty rebate 
  about which there was no dispute. The trial judge found Print Three acted arbitrarily 
  in withholding payment of the royalty rebates. I agree Print Three had no reasonable 
  basis for refusing to pay the royalty rebates that were not in dispute. </p>
<p>
  [78] The fact that the royalty rebates were ultimately paid does not mean that 
  Print Three did not breach its obligations towards Shelanu. The duty of good 
  faith comprises a time component. That time component requires the party under 
  a duty of good faith to respond promptly to a request from the other party and 
  to make a decision within a reasonable time of receiving that request. Parties 
  under a duty of good faith also have an obligation to make payment of any amounts 
  that are clearly owed to the other party in a timely manner: 702535 Ontario 
  Inc. v. Lloyd's London, supra.</p>
<p>
  iii.) Disputed royalty rebate because of refusal to allow inspection </p>
<p>
  [79] Print Three submits that the royalty rebate for the fourth quarter of 1996 
  was never paid because the Deslauriers refused to allow Davis to inspect the 
  production facility at 60 Bloor Street West. Brian Deslauriers testified that 
  he did not take Davis' request seriously because the stated purpose of the meeting 
  on October 3, 1996 was to discuss the 1995 agreement and he wished to get on 
  with that discussion. The royalty rebate for the fourth quarter of 1996 remained 
  outstanding at the commencement of trial.</p>
<p>
  [80] The trial judge found that, on a strict reading of the franchise agreement, 
  Davis was entitled to conduct an inspection but that, in view of Print Three's 
  past practice of not enforcing the strict terms of the franchise agreement, 
  Shelanu was entitled to some form of notification that Print Three intended 
  to strictly enforce its rights under the agreement and that, in any event, Print 
  Three could not withhold the royalty rebate once Shelanu made it clear Davis 
  could inspect the production facility. The respondent submits that the trial 
  judge erred in ordering that a royalty rebate be paid for this period. I would 
  uphold the trial judge's conclusion that the rebate is payable based on a different 
  analysis of the franchise agreement. </p>
<p>
  [81] A franchisee is only entitled to receive a royalty rebate according to 
  paragraph 3C of the franchise agreement: &quot;if he or she has fully complied 
  with all the terms and conditions of this agreement during the pertinent time 
  period.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [82] Paragraph 3C defines what constitutes full compliance with the agreement 
  It stipulates that &quot;[i]n addition to other provisions of this agreement&quot;, 
  &quot;full compliance means timely submission of provincial sales tax returns, 
  timely payment of advertising fees, royalties, other amounts owing to the franchisor 
  or amounts guaranteed by the franchisor to third parties.&quot; The phrase, 
  &quot;other provisions of this agreement&quot; is vague and ambiguous. The terms 
  specified all have a financial component. It makes commercial sense that Print 
  Three would not grant Shelanu a rebate if Shelanu were in default of money owing 
  to it for which it could be responsible to pay; this is the main thrust of the 
  provision.</p>
<p>
  [83] Paragraph 5G of the franchise agreement states that the Franchisee shall 
  permit the franchisor to enter on the premises to conduct: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [a] compliance audit to determine whether Franchise Owner is abiding by the 
  terms of this Agreement and conforming to standards of operation as may have 
  been otherwise detailed in the Operations Manuals, Technical Bulletins or other 
  publications supplied by Franchisor. Franchisor may advise Franchise Owner in 
  writing regarding any deficiencies in Franchise Owner's compliance with Franchisor's 
  standards. Franchise Owner shall have thirty (30) days to cure such deficiencies 
  from the date such written notice is received by Franchise Owner.</p>
<p>
  [84] On the other hand, paragraph 7B states that the franchisee shall permit 
  the franchisor to enter the premises: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [i]n order to inspect and audit all aspects of Franchise Owner's business including, 
  but not limited to: books, records, facilities, business equipment, materials 
  and any other matters relating to Franchise Owner's obligations set out in this 
  Agreement.</p>
<p> [85] Thus the right to inspect is contained in both paragraph 5G and 7B. Paragraph 
  5G envisages a compliance audit with respect to standards of operation and gives 
  a franchisee 30 days in which to cure a &quot;deficiency&quot;. The term &quot;breach&quot; 
  is not used. The word &quot;deficient&quot; is defined in Webster's Dictionary, 
  1989 ed., as &#147;inadequate&quot;. A franchisee could be in compliance with 
  its franchise agreement but still have inadequacies in its operation that the 
  franchisor wanted corrected. Provided the deficiency was corrected within 30 
  days the franchisee would be in compliance with the agreement. Paragraph 7B 
  contains similar wording but envisages a financial audit and contains no time 
  component. </p>
<p>
  [86] There is no evidence to suggest that Davis wished to conduct a financial 
  audit or, indeed, an audit of any kind. He simply stated he wished to inspect 
  the premises. In any event, upon receiving written notice from Print Three, 
  Shelanu promptly offered to remedy the situation. The inspection had no financial 
  impact and none of the specific requirements defined as &quot;full compliance&quot; 
  was breached. In these circumstances, Shelanu's refusal did not affect its right 
  to a royalty rebate and Print Three could not refuse to pay it. </p>
<p>
  [87] I would not have considered the dispute with respect to this single payment 
  to be a breach of Print Three's duty of good faith, in and of itself.</p>
<p>
  [88] Shelanu is entitled to the payment of the disputed royalty rebates.</p>
<p>
  B. Air Miles</p>
<p>
  i.) Facts and finding of the trial judge</p>
<p>
  [89] The franchise agreement provided that franchisees were to pay an annual 
  three per cent advertising fee to Print Three. The relevant portion of paragraph 
  9 respecting advertising states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Due to the inherent importance and value of advertising and the need for standardization 
  and promotion of the Print Three public image and program, the Franchise Owner 
  agrees to pay to Franchisor an advertising fee of THREE PERCENT (3%) of each 
  month's gross sales. Such payment is due by the tenth (10th) day of the month 
  following the month for which the gross sales were made. The advertising fees 
  paid directly to the Franchisor are intended to reasonably compensate Franchisor 
  for the actual cost of advertising and promotional campaigns; provide reasonable 
  and adequate compensation for Franchisor's personnel engaged in the preparation, 
  purchase and arrangement of advertising activities; and to reimburse Franchisor 
  for any fees paid to advertising and other organizations. Franchisor shall have 
  complete discretion to use such advertising funds in such ways as it feels will 
  best promote the products and services offered by the franchise system. </p>
<p>
  [90] Following a vote by the franchisees, the advertising fee was suspended 
  between 1991 and 1994, primarily because of the recession. In November 1994, 
  at the franchisees' convention, a vote was held on whether to reintroduce the 
  fee and whether to enter into the Air Miles program. The trial judge found that, 
  without the vote, the franchisees could be obligated to pay the fee and the 
  vote was really about whether to embark on the Air Miles program or some other 
  advertising program. Print Three represented that, &quot;the entire three percent 
  advertising fee had to go to the Air Miles program in order for Print Three 
  to qualify to be part of that program&quot;. Based on the documents presented 
  in evidence, the trial judge found that that representation was false. The misrepresentation 
  was important because one of the reasons the franchisees were reluctant to participate 
  in the program was that it would consume all of the advertising fees.</p>
<p>
  [91] A second reason that some franchisees, including the Deslauriers, were 
  opposed to participating in the Air Miles program was because it was apparent 
  to them that, although all of the advertising fees went into the program, not 
  all of the benefits of that program would be capable of being used for the franchisees' 
  business. The trial judge found that in order to get over the franchisees' opposition 
  to the Air Miles program, Print Three represented to the franchisees that any 
  air miles purchased under the program, and not distributed by the franchisees 
  to their customers, could be used by the franchisees for their own purposes 
  including personal travel. Both Print Three's letter dated May 2, 1995 and the 
  operations manual for the program support the trial judge's finding in this 
  regard. </p>
<p>
  [92] Shortly after the Air Miles program began, however, Print Three changed 
  these arrangements and directed that all undistributed Air Miles for each outlet 
  could only be used with its approval. The unused Air Miles were placed in accounts 
  in the personal names of certain of its employees. The trial judge found that 
  this unilateral change was a clear breach of the representations made to the 
  franchisees. He held that Shelanu was entitled to damages equivalent to the 
  value of the undistributed Air Miles earned by its franchise to the end of the 
  program. </p>
<p>
  ii.) Argument and analysis</p>
<p>
  [93] The appellant submits that any representations respecting unused Air Miles 
  were not in writing and signed by the parties and, therefore, cannot be enforced 
  because they amounted to an amendment of the franchise agreement that was not 
  in writing and signed by the parties as required by that agreement. Further, 
  Print Three submits that it had an absolute discretion respecting the use of 
  the advertising funds and any use of unused Air Miles and thus, the fact it 
  did not abide by its representations is of no consequence. Finally, the appellant 
  also asserts that the representations were &quot;gratuitous offers to Shelanu 
  regarding advertising which were more advantageous than the terms of the Franchise 
  Agreement&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [94] I have already indicated that parties to a written agreement may subsequently 
  enter into a new oral agreement. I have also indicated that courts will refuse 
  to enforce a written agreement requiring that amendments be in writing where 
  that clause no longer represents the intention of the parties. (See paras. 54 
  and following). With respect to the Air Miles program, the parties agreed to 
  an oral amendment of the agreement respecting advertising fees and their subsequent 
  conduct is indicative that the oral agreement was performed in part. The trial 
  judge clearly found that not all of the money collected was used for the Air 
  Miles program the only advertising undertaken and this finding is supported 
  by the evidence. </p>
<p>
  [95] The appellant's submission that Print Three possessed an absolute discretion 
  with respect to the use of advertising funds ignores paragraph 9 of the franchise 
  agreement which stipulates that the three percent advertising fee is to compensate 
  Print Three &quot;for the actual cost of advertising and promotional campaigns&quot; 
  [emphasis added], to provide reasonable compensation to its employees in preparing 
  and purchasing advertising activities, and to reimburse the franchisor for advertising 
  fees paid. Furthermore, nothing in paragraph 9 gives Print Three the right to 
  use Shelanu's three percent advertising fees for non-advertising related or 
  personal purposes as happened here. Paragraph 26 of the agreement respecting 
  amendments being in writing has nothing to do with excusing breaches of the 
  agreement.</p>
<p>
  [96] Even if paragraph 9 is only a statement of intent and Print Three had an 
  absolute discretion with respect to the use of the Air Miles, Print Three could 
  not exercise that discretion without regard to Shelanu's interests; it was obliged 
  to exercise the discretion in a reasonable manner. See J.D. McCamus, &quot;The 
  Duty of Good Faith Contractual Performance&quot; (N.J.I.: Civil Law Seminar, 
  Contract Law: From Form to Remedies, Osgoode Hall Law School, 17 May 2000). 
  Professor McCamus is of the opinion that under ordinary contract principles, 
  a party has an obligation to act reasonably in exercising a discretionary power. 
  Applying this principle, he says the same result could have been reached in 
  cases recognizing the existence of a duty of good faith in the execution of 
  a contract such as Mason v. Freedman, [1958] S.C.R. 483 at 486; Greenberg v. 
  Meffert (1985), 18 D.L.R. (4th) 548 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme 
  Court of Canada dismissed (1985), 30 D.L.R. (4th) 768; Le Mesurier et al. v. 
  Andrus (1986), 25 D.L.R. (4th) 424 (Ont. C.A.); and Gateway Realty Ltd. v. Arton 
  Holdings Ltd., supra. In Greenberg v. Meffert et al., supra, where a breach 
  of a duty of good faith was found, this court held that the words &quot;at the 
  sole discretion&quot;, in relation to payment of commission by a real estate 
  company to its real estate agent after termination of the relationship meant 
  that the company, &quot;must act reasonably in exercising its discretion, and 
  also honestly and in good faith.&quot; Those standards not having been attained, 
  the agent was entitled to his commission. Here, the trial judge found Print 
  Three acted arbitrarily and unreasonably and not in conformity with the standards 
  for exercising a discretion. On the evidence, it was open to him to make this 
  finding.</p>
<p>[97] Lastly, the misrepresentations were not a gratuitous offer. The consideration 
  for the agreement to credit unused air miles was that Shelanu entered into the 
  Air Miles program as opposed to some other advertising program. </p>
<p>[98] As found by the trial judge, Shelanu is entitled to the cash value of 
  the unused Air Miles. </p>
<p>
  C. Le Print Express</p>
<p>
  i.) Facts and finding of the trial judge</p>
<p>
  [99] Around October 1990, the appellant set up a business initially known as 
  Print Three Express that subsequently became known as Le Print Express. The 
  trial judge found that these outlets were to be smaller than Print Three franchises 
  in order to target individuals and small businesses. The cost to purchase these 
  franchises was lower than the cost to purchase a Print Three franchise and some 
  financing was also offered to potential Le Print Express franchisees. Shelanu 
  complained that the establishment of the Le Print Express concept involved the 
  franchisor in a business that competed with existing Print Three franchises. 
  Brian Deslauriers testified that Le Print Express offered the same kinds of 
  products and services that were, to a large extent, offered by Print Three. 
  In support of his evidence he produced a flyer from the Le Print Express at 
  the Eaton Centre that had been faxed to Shelanu. He further testified that contrary 
  to his understanding that the Le Print Express operations were to be small, 
  occupying 200 square feet, the Eaton operation was three to four times this 
  size and had the same kind of equipment and capabilities as Shelanu. The same 
  personnel and staff who operated and marketed Print Three franchises also handled 
  the requirements of the new franchise. The trial judge held: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It seems to me to be intrinsically troublesome for a franchisor to develop a 
  concept for a new franchise operation that will operate in competition with 
  its existing franchise operation. Even though Le Print Express franchisees were 
  directed at a specific segment of the industry, I am satisfied that they not 
  only would, but did, take work and customers from existing Print Three franchisees. 
  As a consequence, in my view, the establishment of such an enterprise by the 
  very person who owned and controlled the defendant was fundamentally at odds 
  with the defendant's obligations, including the obligation to deal in good faith, 
  to its franchisees. The defendant could not properly and fairly institute this 
  new concept without at least obtaining the agreement of the existing Print Three 
  franchisees to this crucial change to their contractual relationship which, 
  of course, the defendant made no attempt to do. The establishment of the Le 
  Print Express franchises fundamentally altered the nature of the Print Three 
  franchise network and impacted directly on the business environment in which 
  the Print Three franchisees operated. </p>
<p>
  ii.) Argument and analysis</p>
<p>
  [100] The appellant challenges the trial judge's finding of fact that Le Print 
  Express competed with Shelanu's business as well as his conclusion that the 
  establishment of this business took work and customers from Print Three franchisees 
  and Shelanu in particular. The appellant emphasizes that, while there may have 
  been some overlap of services, Le Print Express was in a different business 
  sector than Print Three. </p>
<p>
  [101] In Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] S.C.J. No. 31, the Supreme Court held, 
  at para. 10, that &quot;[t]he standard of review for findings of fact is that 
  such findings are not to be reversed unless it can be established that the trial 
  judge made a 'palpable and overriding error'&quot; [citations omitted]. This 
  deferential standard is also applicable to appellate review of inferences of 
  fact: see Housen, supra at para. 25. </p>
<p> [102] The franchise agreement is silent as to whether the franchisor can engage 
  in a similar business during the term of the agreement.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  Print Three did, however, agree not to take any action that would be likely 
  to injure the goodwill or reputation associated with the Print Three trademark, 
  logo or mark.</p>
<p>
  [103] Print Three targeted corporate accounts, whereas Le Print Express did 
  small copying jobs for individuals and small businesses. None of the Le Print 
  Express franchises was established within Shelanu's exclusive territory; the 
  three Le Print Express locations were the Eaton Centre, Union Station, and Scotia 
  Bank Plaza. Shelanu did not complain about Le Print Express for almost seven 
  years after it was established and Shelanu presented no evidence that it lost 
  income as a result of competition from Le Print Express. The trial judge's reasons 
  do not address these considerations.</p>
<p>
  [104] The trial judge also rejected a number of Shelanu's submissions that would 
  have affected its claim respecting Le Print Express. Shelanu's statement of 
  claim claimed damages for misrepresentation on the basis that the franchise 
  agreement contained representations that Print Three was an expanding organization; 
  it had a commitment to continue to introduce leading edge technologies and systems 
  in document reproduction technology; it would continue to develop the credibility 
  and presence of the Print Three name and logo; and it would continue to improve 
  and modify the know how it had developed. The trial judge held that the failure 
  of these representations to materialize were not breaches of the franchise agreement 
  but goals that had not been achieved. In other words, they were not representations 
  of fact. </p>
<p>
  [105] On the issue of technology, the trial judge described the contribution 
  of Print Three as the bare minimum a franchisee ought to expect in return for 
  royalty payments and held that &quot;&#133; in the end result, I am not satisfied 
  on the evidence that the failures of the defendant [Print Three] on this issue 
  were so great as to constitute a breach of its obligations under the franchise 
  agreement.&quot; The trial judge noted that the evidence in this case was like 
  that in Khagen Investments Ltd. v. 710497 Ontario Ltd., [1999] O.J. No. 2152 
  (S.C.J.), in that there was no evidence as to the standard of service given 
  to other franchisees or whether provision of the same level of service to other 
  franchisees resulted in their failure. He held that these issues could not justify 
  Shelanu's position that it was entitled to treat the franchise agreement at 
  an end as of May 8, 1997. </p>
<p>
  [106] Brian Deslauriers testified that the number of Print Three franchises 
  declined after Le Print Express was created. The trial judge held that, on balance, 
  the reduction in the number of Print Three franchises was largely the result 
  of prevailing economic conditions. By implication, therefore, the establishment 
  of Le Print Express did not contribute to the decline in the number of Print 
  Three franchises.</p>
<p>
  [107] I would ,therefore, hold that the appellant has met the high standard 
  required to overturn a trial judge's finding of fact that Le Print Express competed 
  with Shelanu and took business from it. My reasons for doing so may be summarized 
  as follows: 1) the different nature of the business engaged in by Le Print Express; 
  2) Shelanu's delay in complaining about the establishment of that business; 
  3) the lack of evidence before the trial judge as to Shelanu's consequential 
  loss of income; 4) the trial judge's findings that there had been no misrepresentation 
  concerning what Print Three was to provide in exchange for royalty payments 
  and that Print Three had done the minimum required to discharge those obligations; 
  and 5) the trial judge's finding that the decline in Print Three franchises 
  was primarily due to prevailing economic conditions. The finding that Print 
  Three breached &quot;reasonable commercial standards&quot; must also fail for 
  the same reasons.</p>
<p>
  [108] Inasmuch as I have not upheld the trial judge's finding of fact in respect 
  of Le Print Express, I would not uphold his conclusion that the establishment 
  of Le Print Express was a breach of Print Three's duty of good faith. </p>
<p>
  4. Fundamental Breach</p>
<p>
  A. The findings of the trial judge</p>
<p>
  [109] The trial judge concluded that the various failings and breaches of the 
  franchise agreement by Print Three constituted a fundamental breach of the franchise 
  agreement. The trial judge further held Shelanu was entitled to terminate the 
  franchise agreement because the breaches</p>
<p class="indent"> [a]lso reveal an attitude of the defendant generally toward 
  this franchisee, at least, and toward its obligations under the franchise agreement 
  which demonstrates an intention by the defendant that it was not going to be 
  bound by, nor honour, its obligations under the franchise agreement unless it 
  suited its purpose to do so. </p>
<p>B. The standard of review and analysis</p>
<p>
  [110] A trial judge's finding of fundamental breach is a matter of mixed fact 
  and law. This is because it is a question &quot;about whether the facts satisfy 
  the legal tests&quot;: Housen, supra, at para. 26 citing Canada (Director of 
  Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748 at para. 55. 
  The appropriate standard of review is dependent on where the error lies. As 
  stated by Iacobucci and Major JJ. at para. 36: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Matters of mixed fact and law lie along a spectrum. Where, for instance, an 
  error with respect to a finding of negligence can be attributed to the application 
  of an incorrect standard, a failure to consider a required element of a legal 
  test, or similar error in principle, such an error can be characterized as an 
  error in law, subject to a standard of correctness. Appellate courts must be 
  cautious, however, in finding that a trial judge erred in law in his or her 
  determination of negligence, as it is often difficult to extricate the legal 
  questions from the factual. It is for this reason that these matters are referred 
  to as questions of &quot;mixed law and fact&quot;. Where the legal principle 
  is not readily extricable, then the matter is one of &quot;mixed law and fact&quot; 
  and is subject to a more stringent standard. The general rule, as stated in 
  Jaegli Enterprises, supra, is that, where the issue on appeal involves the trial 
  judge's interpretation of the evidence as a whole, it should not be overturned 
  absent palpable and overriding error. </p>
<p>
  Thus, as stated by Rosenberg J.A. in Algoma Steel Inc. v. Union Gas Ltd., [2003] 
  O.J. No. 71 (C.A.) at para. 19, &quot;where the issue concerns application of 
  a legal standard to a set of facts the question is one of mixed fact and law 
  and a somewhat less deferential standard may be appropriate, although not the 
  standard of correctness required for questions of law.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [111] In order to conclude that Print Three had committed a fundamental breach 
  of its obligations to Shelanu, the trial judge relied on the evidence as a whole, 
  requiring the application of the more stringent standard of review. At the same 
  time, it must be borne in mind that I have not upheld the trial judge's finding 
  that Print Three breached its duty of good faith to Shelanu by establishing 
  the Le Print Express franchise. It is therefore necessary to consider whether 
  the remaining breaches can support the trial judge's conclusion that there was 
  a fundamental breach of the agreement. I am of the opinion that they cannot. 
  As of the date Shelanu gave notice of termination of its obligations to Print 
  Three, Print Three had abused its discretion respecting Air Miles, failed to 
  make payment of the full royalty rebate based on there being a single franchise, 
  delayed in making payment of royalty rebates admittedly due on three occasions, 
  and refused to pay one royalty rebate allegedly based on Shelanu's breach of 
  the franchise agreement for refusing to allow Davis to inspect its premises. 
  The breaches respecting the Air Miles program and non-payment of royalty rebate 
  were the subject of damages awarded by the trial judge. </p>
<p>
  [112] It is also necessary to consider what appears to me to be a further palpable 
  and overriding error on the part of the trial judge. This is the trial judge's 
  failure to consider the fact that although Shelanu gave notice of termination 
  of the agreement on May 8, 1997, it continued to use the name Print Three for 
  a further two and a half years and continued to have an exclusive territory. 
  Shelanu was therefore able to carry on the commercial purpose of the agreement. 
  </p>
<p>
  [113] In Majdpour v. M &amp; B Acquisition Corp (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), 
  the event alleged to have triggered a fundamental breach of the franchise agreement 
  by the franchisor was a bankruptcy. Because the franchisee was able to carry 
  on the commercial purpose of the agreement intact after the bankruptcy, MacPherson 
  J.A. dismissed the franchisee's claim it was discharged from further performance. 
  That reasoning is equally applicable in this case. </p>
<p> [114] In dismissing the claim for fundamental breach, MacPherson J.A. noted 
  that the test was a restrictive one, namely, whether the conduct of one party 
  deprived the other party of 'substantially the whole benefit' of the contract' 
  as stated by Wilson J. in Hunter Engineering, supra.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> This 
  is the classic formulation of the test as set out by Diplock L.J. in Hongkong 
  Fir Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., [1962] 2 Q.B. 26 (C.A.) 
  at 66: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [d]oes the occurrence of the event deprive the party who has further undertakings 
  still to perform of substantially the benefit which it was the intention of 
  the parties as expressed in the contract that he should obtain in consideration 
  for performing those undertakings. </p>
<p>
  [115] Print Three submits that, because the trial judge relied on the words 
  of Gonthier J. at para. 33 of his reasons in Farber v. Royal Trust Co., [1997] 
  1 S.C.R. 846, namely that, &quot;where one party to a contract demonstrates 
  an intention no longer to be bound by it, that party is committing a fundamental 
  breach of the contract that results in its termination,&quot; the trial judge 
  applied the wrong legal test for fundamental breach. The appellant submits that 
  this phraseology is only appropriate for employment law contracts and that the 
  only correct phraseology for fundamental breach is whether the failure of one 
  party to perform its contractual obligations had the effect of depriving the 
  other of &quot;substantially the whole benefit&quot; of the contract. </p>
<p>
  [116] I do not agree that the phraseology used by Gonthier J. in Farber, supra, 
  is restricted to the employment law context. Indeed this is precisely the phraseology 
  used by G.C. Cheshire and C.H.S. Fifoot to describe the circumstances in which 
  a breach of contract will excuse further performance in their text The Law of 
  Contract, 5th ed. (London: Butterworths, 1960) at 488: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A breach of contract is a cause of discharge only if its effect is to render 
  it purposeless for the innocent to proceed further with performance. Further 
  performance is rendered purposeless if one party either shows an intention no 
  longer to be bound by the contract or breaks a stipulation of major importance 
  to the contract. </p>
<p>
  [117] I agree, however, that the deprivation of &quot;substantially the whole 
  benefit of the contract&quot; is the phraseology adopted by this court to describe 
  the test for fundamental breach in Robson v. Thorne, Ernst &amp; Whinney (1999), 
  127 O.A.C. 215, at para. 18 (C.A.) and Bayer v. Aktiengesellschaft et al v. 
  Apotex (1998), 113 O.A.C. 1 at para. 34 (C.A.) as well as Majdpour, supra. In 
  the circumstances of this case, the phraseology chosen by the trial judge to 
  describe the test for fundamental breach may not have been the most appropriate 
  one to define the sort of breach that would excuse Shelanu from further performance 
  of its obligations.</p>
<p>
  [118] Professor Waddams addresses the variety of expressions that have been 
  used to define the sort of breach that will excuse a party from further performance 
  under a contract in his text: Waddams, supra at para. 583. Waddams says that 
  behind all of these expressions lies a single notion, that of substantial failure 
  of performance. Irrespective of the expression used, he proposes five factors 
  derived from the jurisprudence to measure whether future performance under a 
  contract should be excused at para. 587. In 968703 Ontario Ltd. v. Vernon (2002), 
  58 O.R. (3d) 215 (C.A.) this court, after referring to the decisions in Robson, 
  supra, and Bayer, supra, adopted and applied the factors suggested by Waddams 
  to measure whether future performance should be excused. They are: (a) the ratio 
  of the party's obligation not performed to the obligation as a whole; (b) the 
  seriousness of the breach to the innocent party; (c) the likelihood of repetition 
  of such breach; (d) the seriousness of the consequences of the breach; and (e) 
  the relationship of the part of the obligation performed to the whole obligation. 
  Applying those factors to the breaches by Print Three in this case would not 
  lead to the conclusion that Shelanu should be excused from further performance 
  of its obligations. </p>
<p>
  [119] Applying Waddams' guidelines in this case would not lead to the conclusion 
  that Shelanu should be excused from future performance. The first and fifth 
  factors appear to be aimed at helping a court to ascertain whether the contract 
  was substantially performed. See Fairbanks Soap Co. v. Sheppard, [1953] 2 D.L.R. 
  193 (S.C.C.). The crux of the agreement between Print Three and Shelanu was 
  the licence to use Print Three's name and trademark in exchange for royalty 
  payments and its exclusive territory. Print Three did not revoke or undermine 
  Shelanu's licence to use Print Three's name and trademark and Shelanu continued 
  to use them. In return, Shelanu was obligated to make royalty payments which 
  it did. Over the ten years of the franchise agreement, Print Three also paid 
  Shelanu the majority of its royalty rebates. I would also disagree that Print 
  Three evinced an intention to no longer be bound by the agreement as a whole 
  although it certainly refused to be bound by parts of it. Print Three did not 
  place another franchisee in Shelanu's territory until after Shelanu's franchise 
  agreement had expired. Shelanu was not deprived of substantially the whole of 
  the benefit of its agreement with Print Three.</p>
<p>
  [120] The second and fourth factors are aimed at measuring the effect of the 
  breach on the innocent party while the third factor, the likelihood of repetition 
  of the breach, is aimed specifically at whether the aggrieved party should be 
  released because continued performance would be intolerable due to repetition 
  of the breaches. To a small business like Shelanu, the delay in payment of royalty 
  rebates on three occasions, the failure to pay the rebate based on there being 
  a single franchise and the abuse of discretion respecting the advertising program 
  were undoubtedly serious but they do not appear to have made it intolerable 
  for Shelanu to continue to operate the franchise because that is what it continued 
  to do.</p>
<p>
  [121] Consequently, Shelanu is not entitled to recover the royalties paid by 
  it since May 8, 1997 which the trial judge assessed at $199,622 nor the $59,870. 
  in advertising fees paid by it after that date. (The latter amount would be 
  subject to any credit for unused Air Miles until that program was discontinued.)</p>
<p>
  [122] Lastly, I would point out that in Hunter Engineering, supra, the court 
  was concerned with the delivery of damaged equipment. The court was not dealing 
  with a contractual relationship that required the parties to continue to interact 
  with each other on an ongoing basis. The same is also true of the situation 
  in Hongkong Fir Shipping, supra. In the context of a franchise agreement, which, 
  as I have noted bears certain similarities to the employment law situation, 
  there is an ongoing, interactive relationship. I note that, following Farber, 
  supra, this court has held that a party may be excused from further performance 
  of an employment contract and the employer held in constructive breach of the 
  agreement where the employer's treatment of the employee makes continued employment 
  intolerable: Shah v. Xerox Canada Ltd., [2000] O.J. No. 849 (C.A.). See also 
  Whiting v. Winnipeg River Brokenhead Community Futures Development Corp. (1998), 
  159 D.L.R. (4th) 18 (Man. C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [123] Having regard to the current jurisprudence, the trial judge might have 
  chosen more apt phraseology to describe the test for fundamental breach but 
  I would not hold that the trial judge erred in law in using the phraseology 
  that he did. Rather, as I have indicated, it is in the application of the test 
  for fundamental breach that he erred. </p>
<p>
  C. Amounts owing because there was no fundamental breach</p>
<p>
  [124] Because Shelanu is not excused from its obligations under the franchise 
  agreement, Shelanu is not entitled to recover the royalties it paid to Print 
  Three, which the trial judge assessed at $199,622. </p>
<p>
  [125] Against the amount of $199,622, I would hold, however, that Shelanu is 
  entitled to receive credit for royalty rebates withheld by Print Three. </p>
<p>
  [126] Shelanu's notice of termination would not, of itself, disentitle Shelanu 
  to the royalty rebate provided that it continued to be in compliance with its 
  obligations under the agreement. Because the agreement did not expire until 
  December 1999 and Shelanu continued to pay royalties that Print Three accepted 
  until October of that year, it was not in breach of the one-year non-competition 
  clause contained in the agreement while it paid royalties. The trial judge held 
  that an error Print Three made with respect to a Yellow Pages advertisement 
  was not a breach of the agreement and I would agree with his conclusion in that 
  regard. </p>
<p>
  [127] Shelanu is entitled to a royalty rebate credit during the period it paid 
  royalties. </p>
<p>
  [128] Print Three is entitled to the $59,870 in advertising fees paid by Shelanu 
  after it gave notice of termination. The latter amount would be subject to any 
  credit for unused Air Miles until that program was discontinued, or to the advertising 
  rebate otherwise payable under the agreement. </p>
<p>
  [129] Having found that the trial judge erred in holding that Print Three had 
  fundamentally breached the franchise agreement I now turn to Print Three's appeal 
  from the trial judge's dismissal of its counterclaim and Shelanu's cross-appeal 
  on damages.</p>
<p>
  5. The Counterclaim and Cross-Appeal</p>
<p>
  [130] I approach my review of the damages assessed bearing in mind that a trial 
  judge's assessment of damages is ordinarily entitled to great deference. As 
  stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Naylor Group v. Ellis Don Construction, 
  [2001] 2 S.C.R. 943 at 977-78: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is common ground that the Court of Appeal was not entitled to substitute 
  its own view of a proper award unless it could be shown that the trial judge 
  had made an error of principle of law, or misapprehended the evidence, or it 
  could be shown there was no evidence on which the trial judge could have reached 
  his or her conclusion, or the trial judge failed to consider relevant factors 
  in the assessment of damages, or considered irrelevant factors, or otherwise, 
  in the result, made &quot;a palpably incorrect&quot; of &quot;wholly erroneous&quot; 
  assessment of the damages. Where one or more of these conditions are met, however, 
  the appellate court is obliged to interfere. </p>
<p>
  [131] The trial judge held that, in the event he was wrong in concluding there 
  had been a fundamental breach of the agreement, Print Three was entitled to 
  damages that he assessed at $465,500 over a ten-year period. The award has three 
  components: $64,500 for the waiver of a franchise fee; $225,000 for lost royalties 
  and $176,000 for lost advertising fees, both calculated over a 10-year period. 
  </p>
<p> [132] The trial judge dismissed the following claims by Print Three, because 
  there was no evidence to support those assessments: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A claim for $750,000 for Shelanu's business, as a turn-key operation, on 
    the basis that &quot;[a]ll of the assets of that business would be the property 
    of the plaintiff with the exception of the name and the telephone number.&quot;</li>
  <li>A complaint that Shelanu did not assign the lease in accordance with paragraph 
    15F of the franchise agreement. Print Three took no steps to negotiate a lease 
    so Shelanu could stay in its location when the existing lease expired during 
    the currency of the franchise agreement and Print Three was subject to a number 
    of judgments from creditors. The trial judge held the only commercially reasonable 
    thing for Shelanu to do was to negotiate the lease in its own name. </li>
  <li>A claim for $180,000 for the cost of equivalent signage. While the trial 
    judge accepted that the loss of the Print Three name in a well-traveled shopping 
    concourse area in a busy section of Toronto could result in damages, he dismissed 
    that claim because there was no evidence before him sufficient to establish 
    an actual loss or the amount of such a loss. </li>
  <li>The claim for one new or renewed franchise in Shelanu's territory on the 
    basis that Mr. Davis' evidence that another franchisee would be unwilling 
    to locate in the territory was nothing more than sheer speculation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [133] Only the finding respecting the lease requires further comment. Under 
  clause 19 of the franchise agreement, Print Three had agreed to give Shelanu 
  an exclusive territory at 60 Bloor Street West until the expiry of the franchise 
  in 1999. In failing to renegotiate the terms of the lease or, if that was not 
  possible, offering to relocate Shelanu at Print Three's expense within the territory, 
  Print Three breached this provision. Once Shelanu had renegotiated the lease 
  in its own name, Print Three did not execute a sublease with Shelanu and reimburse 
  it for any rental deposit as required by the franchise agreement. Given the 
  lapse of time of about three years with neither party complaining about the 
  state of the lease this appears to be yet another instance of the parties amending 
  the agreement by their conduct about which Print Three cannot now complain. 
  In any event, having failed to fulfill its obligations under the franchise agreement, 
  Print Three cannot benefit from its breaches by asserting the right to have 
  the lease assigned to it at the end of the franchise agreement. </p>
<p>
  [134] I must now deal with the claims the trial judge did allow. The waiver 
  of the franchise fee arose when Paul Kim, an existing franchisee, approached 
  Print Three about putting a franchise in Shelanu's territory about six months 
  prior to the expiry of Shelanu's franchise. Print Three gave Mr. Kim a franchise 
  just north of Shelanu's territory. The Kim franchise was required to operate 
  in direct competition with Shelanu, which continued to operate at the Bloor 
  Location, and, since Print Three could not deliver either the Bloor Location, 
  the customer list, the telephone or fax numbers to the Kim Franchise, Print 
  Three waived its usual franchise fee of $64,500 in order to secure the Kim Franchise 
  without this. The trial judge found that in order for Print Three to mitigate 
  its damages it was necessary for Print Three to waive its franchise fee in granting 
  Mr. Kim a franchise. Having regard to the evidence, there is no basis on which 
  to interfere with the trial judge's finding in this regard. </p>
<p>
  [135] The trial judge's award of damages for lost royalties and advertising 
  fees over a period of 10 years is problematic. The underpinning for his conclusion 
  appears to be in paragraph 81 of his reasons wherein he stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The loss of the 6% royalty and the loss of the advertising fees for ten years 
  assumes that the plaintiff would have continued to be a franchisee or that another 
  franchisee would have been found for the plaintiff's location. While that assumption 
  is fair enough, the claim must be subject to a duty to mitigate, that is, the 
  defendant had an obligation to mitigate its damages by locating another franchisee 
  in the same territory where the plaintiff was continuing to operate. Indeed, 
  the defendant did exactly that when it sold a franchise to Mr. Kim, an existing 
  franchisee, to operate a franchise outlet on Cumberland Street which is just 
  north of the plaintiff's location [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  I am of the opinion that the trial judge erred in assessing damages based on 
  this assumption.</p>
<p>
  [136] In assessing damages the onus is on Print Three to prove its damages on 
  a reasonable preponderance of credible evidence. The trial judge was required 
  to put Print Three in the same position it would have been in had the agreement 
  been performed, that is, had Shelanu not competed for one year in a defined 
  geographic area. Having regard to the trial judge's finding that Print Three 
  was not entitled to Shelanu's business or lease once the franchise agreement 
  ended, which I have upheld, another franchisee could not have been placed in 
  Shelanu's location. The trial judge was not entitled to base his award of damages 
  on an assumption that did not accord with the specific facts of this case. Print 
  Three would not have had a franchisee in Shelanu's location. It would only have 
  had, as it did, a franchisee located just north of Bloor and Cumberland.</p>
<p>
  [137] The trial judge erred in principle in concluding that Print Three was 
  entitled to damages based on the projected revenue stream from Shelanu's franchise 
  less Mr. Kim's projected revenue over a ten-year period, the entire life of 
  a franchise agreement. If Shelanu had observed the one year non competition 
  clause in the franchise agreement, there is no evidence to suggest that all 
  of Shelanu's customers would have become customers of the new franchisee. The 
  Shelanu Print Three franchise was not the only copying business in the geographic 
  area. The geographic restrictions contained in the one year non competition 
  clause were five miles from one specific franchisee and seven miles from another. 
  If Shelanu had moved its business just outside the geographic area, there is 
  no evidence to suggest it would have lost all its customers or personal goodwill. 
  As noted earlier, the evidence indicates that Shelanu targeted corporate and 
  business accounts, not walk in trade. After one year, Shelanu was entitled to 
  compete again with Print Three within the same geographic area. There is no 
  evidence that, after one year, Shelanu's goodwill would have been so impaired 
  that many of its customers would not have returned to it. </p>
<p>
  [138] Based on Shelanu's breach of the non-competition clause some damages must 
  also be assessed for loss of revenue to Mr. Kim over one year. The figures for 
  all forty two Print Three franchisees for the five years prior to October 1999, 
  disclosed that the average franchisee paid approximately $25,000 annually in 
  royalties and $4,700 annually in advertising fees. This figure was about one-half 
  the annual royalties and advertising fees paid by Shelanu. The trial judge chose 
  to adopt this average figure as the basis for his calculation and Print Three 
  does not challenge it as being too low. By taking the average yearly sales of 
  the average franchisee as his basis for awarding damages for loss of royalties 
  and advertising fees the trial judge effectively took account of the complex 
  contingencies that Shelanu's personal goodwill may not have been transferred 
  to another franchisee and that Mr. Kim may not have been as competent as Shelanu 
  in operating its franchise. In Martin v. Goldfarb (1998), 41 O.R. (2d) 161 (C.A.) 
  at 187, Finlayson J.A. held that a defendant is not entitled to have damages 
  assessed by guesswork when the party bearing the burden of adducing the evidence 
  has failed to do so. However, where there are complex contingencies, incapable 
  of proof, a court must then do its best to assess the quantum of damages.</p>
<p>
  [139] Having regard to these considerations, in addition to the franchise fee 
  of $64,500, I would substitute an award of damages for one year's loss of revenue 
  and advertising fees which, in accordance with the trial judge's figure for 
  one year, I would fix at $29,700 for a total of $94,200.</p>
<p>
  IV. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [140] For the reasons given, I would allow both the appeal and cross-appeal 
  as indicated. In view of the divided success on this appeal I would order that 
  the parties bear their own costs. </p>

<hr style="height: 1px; color: #000000">
<P><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> The present regulations to the franchise 
  legislation in Ontario now require that the franchise agreement contain a statement 
  of the franchisor&#146;s policy respecting setting up a competing business by 
  it. The regulations also require that the franchisee be provided with a description 
  of the franchisor&#146;s policy, if any, respecting the proximity between an 
  existing franchise and another franchise granted by the franchisor that distributes 
  similar products or services under a different trade-mark, trade name or logo. 
  In the absence of such disclosure, &#147;&#133;.there is an expectation on the 
  part of the franchisee that the franchisor will not establish a corporate or 
  franchise location (or another business of channel of distribution) within such 
  proximity or in such a manner that would negatively effect the franchisee&#146;s 
  business.&#148; See J.P. Hoffman, &#147;Statutory Obligations of Fair Dealing 
  and Good Faith in Canada&#148; (2nd Annual Franchise Law Conference: A New Act, 
  A New Era of Disclosure &#150; One Year Later, Ontario Bar Association C.L.E., 
  22 February, 2002) [unpublished], at 22. Among the cases discussed are Supermarch&eacute;

  held that Provigo owed the supermarkets bearing its name a duty to provide assistance 
  and to support the franchise system and not to compete with it, particularly 
  in the area of pricing. Provigo had breached its statutory duty of good faith 
  under the Civil Code. Kelsey Group Inc. v. 75766 Ontario Ltd., [1990] O.J. No. 
  598 (H.C.J.) where notices of termination delivered by the franchisor to its 
  franchisee were held to be a smoke screen to enable it to establish another 
  franchise in the franchisee&#146;s territory; and Metro- Pacific Cellular Inc. 
  v. Rogers Cantel Inc. et al. (1994), 57 C.P.R. (3d) 538 (B.C. Sup. Ct.), where 
  the court held that Cantel could not compete directly with its non-exclusive 
  dealer in downtown Vancouver. </p>
<p>Presumably one factor that would be a consideration as to whether the franchisor 
  can set up a competing business is whether the franchisee has an exclusive territory.
