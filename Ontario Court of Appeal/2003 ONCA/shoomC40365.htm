<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We see no reason to interfere with the judgment of Pitt J. On the evidence 
  before him, he was justified in finding that an enforceable settlement agreement 
  had been concluded on Friday, December 6, 2002 and that the agreement was reflected 
  in Mr. Davis&#8217;s letter of December 9, 2002. </p>
<p> [2] Mr. Davis&#8217;s letter confirmed the settlement in the following terms:</p>
<p> 1. your client will pay to our firm in trust the sum of $18.50 per share for 
  a total amount of $5,355,824.00;</p>
<p> 2. your client will pay interest at the rate of 6% on the sum of $5,355,824.00 
  from January 24, 2002 to the date of payment;</p>
<p> 3. the action will be dismissed without costs;</p>
<p> 4. the parties will exchange full and final releases.</p>
<p> [3] Putting the appellant&#8217;s position at its best, Mr. Sahi left the 
  meeting on December 6th believing that the method of satisfying the settlement 
  price had yet to be agreed upon, even though he never expressly raised that 
  matter in the settlement meeting on December 6th. Despite this belief, neither 
  Mr. Sahi nor his counsel, acting upon Mr. Sahi&#8217;s instructions, made any 
  response to the December 9th letter. As the motions judge noted, Mr. Davis would 
  have had every reason to treat the lack of response as demonstrating an endorsement 
  of his interpretation of the agreement into which he understood they had entered.</p>
<p> [4] The argument that the parties had not agreed upon all essential terms 
  of the agreement cannot succeed on the facts of this case. </p>
<p> [5] The appellant&#8217;s counsel conceded at the hearing of this appeal that 
  the fact that payment is to be made into Mr. Davis&#8217;s firm&#8217;s trust 
  account, a term expressly set out in the December 9th letter, is consistent 
  only with a cash payment being made for the shares.</p>
<p> [6] Any reasonable person would have understood that Mr. Sahi&#8217;s offer 
  to settle the matter for $18.50 per share, without any suggestion that payment 
  was to be other than by way of cash, was a cash offer. This inference is irresistible 
  when considered against the backdrop of the other terms that were expressly 
  agreed to at the meeting, namely, that interest would be paid at the rate of 
  6% from January 24, 2002 to the date of payment and that that there would be 
  no payment for legal costs incurred by the respondents in pursuing the action.</p>
<p> [7] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent fixed 
  in the amount of $10,000, inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
