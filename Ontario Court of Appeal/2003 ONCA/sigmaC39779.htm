<p>On appeal from the order of Justice John D. Ground of the Superior Court of 
  Justice (Commercial List) dated January 23, 2003. </p>
<p>
  CRONK J.A.:</p>
<p>
  I. Background</p>
<p>
  [1] By order of Farley J. of the Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) 
  dated October 25, 2001, Fantom Technologies Inc. and related companies (the 
  &quot;Fantom Group&quot;) obtained protection under the Companies' Creditors 
  Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36, as amended (the &quot;CCAA Order&quot;). 
  By the CCAA Order, the appellants and other suppliers of the Fantom Group were 
  required to deliver to the Fantom Group or to the respondent, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
  Inc., in its capacity as interim receiver for the Fantom Group (the &quot;Interim 
  Receiver&quot;), forthwith on demand therefor, such moulds or tooling belonging 
  to the Fantom Group as were in their possession.</p>
<p>
  [2] On the date of the CCAA Order, the appellants were in possession of various 
  parts, moulds and tools belonging to the Fantom Group in respect of some of 
  which they claimed vendors' liens for amounts allegedly owing to them by the 
  Fantom Group. The appellants delivered the property in question to the Interim 
  Receiver on condition that any proceeds of sale of the property be held in court 
  pending determination of the parties entitled thereto. On May 1, 2002, following 
  court-approved sales of the property by the Interim Receiver, the appellants 
  moved for an order determining their entitlement to the sale proceeds and approving 
  the payment to them of any funds to which they were found entitled. The Bank 
  of Nova Scotia disputes the appellants' entitlement to any portion of the sale 
  proceeds in part on the ground that, under a general security agreement held 
  by the bank, its entitlement to the proceeds ranks in priority to that of the 
  appellants. The appellants' motion was originally returnable on May 7, 2002.</p>
<p>
  [3] Subsequently, in September 2002 and December 2002, the appellants consented 
  to two different scheduling orders which detailed the nature and the timing 
  of the procedural steps necessary to enable their motion to be heard. The second 
  scheduling order provided that, if the appellants failed to meet any deadline 
  specified in the order, the Interim Receiver would be at liberty to move ex 
  parte for an order dismissing the appellants' motion. </p>
<p>
  [4] Both scheduling orders required the appellants to deliver any expert material 
  by a set date. It is undisputed that the appellants failed to comply with that 
  term of both scheduling orders. That non-compliance continues to date.</p>
<p>
  [5] On January 7, 2003, approximately three and one-half months after the date 
  originally set in the first scheduling order and four days after the date set 
  in the second scheduling order for the delivery of the appellants' expert material, 
  Farley J. granted the Interim Receiver an ex parte order dismissing the appellants' 
  motion consequent upon their failure to meet the specified deadline for delivery 
  of their expert material. By order dated January 23, 2003, Ground J. of the 
  Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) dismissed the appellants' motion 
  to set aside the January 7, 2003 ex parte order. The appellants now appeal the 
  dismissal order of Ground J. to this court.</p>
<p>
  2. Discussion</p>
<p>
  [6] Although the appellants asserted before the motions judge and argue before 
  this court that valid reasons exist for their non-compliance with both scheduling 
  orders, the motions judge held that a pattern of non-compliance by the appellants 
  had been demonstrated and that they had failed to adduce evidence of a valid 
  explanation for such non-compliance. In our view, on the evidentiary record 
  before him, the motions judge was entitled to make those findings. Further, 
  before this court, the appellants failed to provide any cogent explanation, 
  based on admissible evidence, for their delay in providing on a timely basis 
  the information that they committed to provide under both scheduling orders.</p>
<p>
  [7] The failure of the appellants to comply with the scheduling orders to which 
  they consented is most troublesome. On the record before this court, it is unclear 
  where responsibility lies, as between the appellants and their agents, for the 
  appellants' persistent non-compliance. Nonetheless, as the moving parties before 
  the court, the appellants are ultimately responsible for the consequences of 
  their failure to honour scheduling commitments voluntarily undertaken by them 
  or on their behalf.</p>
<p>
  [8] The courts are always reluctant to foreclose a possibly meritorious claim 
  without an adjudication on the merits. In this case, however, notwithstanding 
  request therefor by the respondents since at least September 2002 and the appellants' 
  undertakings to provide same, to date the appellants have still not produced 
  the documentation and information necessary to establish the priority of their 
  claimed liens over the security interest asserted by the Bank of Nova Scotia. 
  As well, although the appellants argued in this proceeding that they held valid 
  and enforceable security interests in property of the Fantom Group on the date 
  of the CCAA Order entitling them to the funds now held in court, no evidence 
  establishing the priority of their claims forms part of the record or of any 
  fresh evidence application before us.</p>
<p>
  [9] The motions judge's order was made by him in the exercise of his supervisory 
  discretion concerning the receivership of the Fantom Group. We are satisfied 
  that in making his order he gave sufficient weight to all relevant considerations, 
  including the need to foster the administration of justice both by permitting 
  access to the courts and requiring compliance by litigants with court orders. 
  In our view, it is important to preserve the integrity of the Commercial List, 
  particularly in voluntarily undertaken scheduling matters, where expeditious 
  and fair adjudication is necessary in the oversight of the conduct of proceedings 
  to avoid unnecessary cost and delay and to advance the interests of all affected 
  parties. The appellants in this case were afforded ample opportunity to proceed 
  with their motion in accordance with procedures and deadlines agreed upon and, 
  in some instances, sought by them. </p>
<p>
  3. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [10] For the reasons given, the appellants have failed to demonstrate any error 
  by the motions judge in the exercise of his discretion. Accordingly, the appeal 
  is dismissed. The respondents are entitled to their costs of the appeal and 
  of the motion for leave to appeal to this court. In our view, this is not a 
  proper case for an award of costs on a substantial indemnity scale. Accordingly, 
  PricewaterhouseCoopers Inc., in its capacity as Interim Receiver, is entitled 
  to its costs of the appeal and the leave motion on a partial indemnity scale, 
  fixed in the total amount of $12,000, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and 
  Services Tax. The Bank of Nova Scotia is entitled to its costs of the appeal 
  and the leave motion on a partial indemnity scale, fixed in the total amount 
  of $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services Tax. </p>
