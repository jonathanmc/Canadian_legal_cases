<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Linda M. Walters dated December 12, 
  2002.</p>


<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] This appeal involves the inevitably difficult issue of whether it is in 
  the best interests of children to relocate with one parent to a place far from 
  the other parent. The respondent, the children&#146;s primary care giver, is 
  moving to Germany to live with her new spouse. She wants to take the children, 
  aged 12 and 7, with her. The appellant insists that it is not in the children&#146;s 
  best interests to move from their familiar surroundings in Oakville to Germany 
  where it will be more difficult for him to maintain close contact with them. 
  He submits that an order allowing the children to remain in Canada and giving 
  him primary care responsibilities would be in their best interests.</p>
<p>[2] There is no doubt that both the appellant and the respondent are capable 
  parents who love their children. Sadly, there can be no judicial resolution 
  of this issue before us that will avoid profound disappointment to one of these 
  caring parents or completely avoid the risk of harm to the interests of the 
  children.</p>
<p>[3] The case was heard and carefully considered by an experienced judge who 
  applied the test articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon v. Goertz, 
  [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27. She concluded that it was in the best interests of the children 
  that they remain in the day-to-day care of their primary care giver, the respondent. 
  The trial judge recognized that &#147;a move to Germany will impact on the children&#146;s 
  relationship with their father&#148; but found that &#147;the loss of their 
  primary caregiver would have a greater impact on the children.&#148;</p>
<p>[4] The appellant was most impressive when arguing his own case before this 
  court. However, it is well established that especially in custody cases, an 
  appellate court can only intervene if the trial judge erred in law or made a 
  material error in the appreciation of the facts. Despite the appellant&#146;s 
  very careful and articulate submissions, we are not persuaded that there is 
  any basis upon which we could interfere with the decision of the trial judge. 
  Accordingly, we have no alternative but to dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>[5] We do not accept the appellant&#146;s submission that the trial judge failed 
  to undertake a full and sensitive inquiry into the best interests of the children 
  as required by Gordon v. Goertz. This was undoubtedly a close case upon which 
  reasonable people might differ. However, we are satisfied from her reasons that 
  the trial judge fully and fairly considered the evident disruption the children 
  that would be caused by a move to Germany. We cannot say that she erred in law 
  or misapprehended the evidence by concluding that the loss of their primary 
  care giver would be more significant that the loss of their familiar surroundings 
  in Oakville.</p>
<p>[6] The trial judge was not bound to follow the opinion of the child and family 
  psychiatrist who prepared the s. 30 assessment, particularly as that opinion 
  was strongly influenced by his assessment that the legal arrangements in Germany 
  were not adequate to protect the appellant&#146;s rights. We do not accept the 
  submission that she misread or misapprehended the psychiatrist&#146;s opinion 
  that in many respects, the children would benefit from a move to Germany. While 
  she did not agree with the expert&#146;s opinion, she neither ignored nor misconstrued 
  it, and she was entitled, indeed required, to come to her own conclusion as 
  to the children&#146;s bests interests.</p>
<p>[7] We are concerned by the uncertainty in the record before us as to the willingness 
  of the German courts to enforce foreign custody orders. However, there was ample 
  evidence to support the trial judge&#146;s finding that the respondent has been 
  flexible and cooperative in affording access and that she genuinely wishes her 
  children to have a strong and lasting relationship with their father. In the 
  absence of evidence of any significant risk of non-compliance by the appellant, 
  we do not consider the uncertainty as to legal enforcement to be sufficient 
  to disturb the trial judge&#146;s order.</p>
<p>[8] In our view, this case is readily distinguishable from Young v. Young (2003), 
  63 O.R. (3d) 112 (C.A.) where this court concluded that the application judge 
  erred in law by failing to conduct the &#147;full and sensitive inquiry&#148; 
  into the best interests of the children as required by Gordon v. Goertz, misapprehended 
  evidence, and simply failed to consider the s. 30 assessment. Here, as we have 
  already noted, the trial judge gave careful and detailed reasons revealing no 
  error of law or misapprehension of evidence. We can understand the appellant&#146;s 
  profound disappointment with those reasons, but in this court, they must be 
  accorded the deference to which they are entitled in law, and accordingly we 
  dismiss the appeal. </p>
<p>[9] The appellant has led fresh evidence that he is currently employed in Toronto 
  and residing in his former home in Oakville. At the time of trial, he was seeking 
  employment that would allow him to return to Oakville, but there was some uncertainty 
  about his prospects. In our view, this new evidence does not meet the test that 
  it would have affected the result at trial. The trial judge was aware that the 
  appellant was in the process of relocating to Oakville, and the fresh evidence 
  does not bear upon her central finding, namely, that it was in the best interests 
  of these children to remain with the respondent, their primary care giver.</p>
<p>[10] The respondent is entitled to costs on a partial indemnity basis which 
  we fix at $12,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
