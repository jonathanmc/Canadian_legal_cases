<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released orally: June 27, 2003<br>
</p>
<p>[1] The appellants appeal from the findings of guilt for assault with a weapon. 
  S. K. appeals the finding of guilt on three grounds: (1) the trial judge's interventions 
  during the testimony of various witnesses created an appearance of unfairness 
  that deprived him of a fair trial; (2) the trial judge failed to apply the correct 
  standard of scrutiny to the appellant's evidence; and (3) the verdict was unreasonable. 
  Z. A. appeals the finding of guilt on the ground that the verdict was unreasonable.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge did intervene too often during the testimony of some witnesses. 
  Some of his interventions were appropriate - for example, when he sought clarification 
  or did not hear what a witness had said. However, other interventions were unwarranted. 
  He interrupted counsel for no valid purpose on too many occasions. That said, 
  there is nothing in the content of the trial judge's questions to give rise 
  to any appearance of unfairness. The questions were pertinent and were posed 
  in a fair and even-handed fashion.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] Although the trial judge did not mention the reasoning formula set out 
  in R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, his reasons, read as a whole, are consistent 
  with that formula. The trial judge stated forcefully that he did not believe 
  the testimony of S. K. It is clear from his reasons that he was not left with 
  a reasonable doubt by that evidence. On the other hand, he was satisfied that 
  the Crown evidence, including the testimony of an eyewitness and a co-accused, 
  established S. K.'s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] There is no basis for concluding that the verdicts of guilty were unreasonable. 
  There was a good deal of evidence to justify the findings of guilt made by the 
  trial judge. In particular, there was ample evidence to support the trial judge's 
  conclusion that the appellant's were involved in a &quot;joint venture&quot; 
  in committing the assault on the complainant.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Both appellants also appeal their dispositions, which were six months closed 
  custody, followed by three months open custody and 15 months probation. We see 
  no basis for interfering with these dispositions. The appellants participated 
  in an unprovoked and violent assault with machetes. They were both on bail for 
  other offences at the time of the commission of the assault. They are very fortunate 
  that the injuries to the complainant were not more serious, which in turn might 
  have led to much more serious criminal charges. The fact that the adult co-accused, 
  Khan received a lesser sentence - a suspended sentence - is not a disparity 
  which entitles us to interfere with the appellants' dispositions. Khan pleaded 
  guilty to simple assault, testified as a Crown witness at the appellants' trial, 
  had no criminal record, and was not on bail at the time of the offences.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] The appeals from the findings of guilt are dismissed. Leave to appeal the 
  dispositions is granted and the disposition appeals are dismissed.</p>
