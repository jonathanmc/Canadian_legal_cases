<p>On appeal from the finding of guilt by Justice James D. Greco of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice (Youth Court) dated February 21, 2002 and the disposition imposed 
  on June 10 and 14, 2002.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant was charged with sexual assault and sexual interference concerning 
  an incident during a cadet camping trip. Justice James D. Greco of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice (Youth Court) found the appellant guilty of the offence of 
  sexual interference and conditionally stayed the charge of sexual assault. He 
  imposed a disposition of 15 months secure custody, to be served in an adult 
  correctional facility, followed by 12 months of probation. The appellant appeals 
  both the finding of guilt and the disposition.</p>
<p>
  [2] At the time of the alleged offence, the appellant was 16 years of age. The 
  complainant was a 12-year old girl. Both the appellant and the complainant were 
  members of the cadets. The cadets went on an overnight camping trip. The complainant 
  alleged that the appellant sexually assaulted her during this camping trip. 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] Three witnesses testified at the trial. The complainant testified that in 
  the evening, a group of cadets were sitting around a fire pit. The appellant 
  asked the complainant to take a walk with him. They walked for some distance, 
  at which time they stopped. The appellant smoked a cigarette. They sat down 
  and he began kissing her on her neck and then on her lips. She let him. He then 
  placed his hand under her shirt and touched her breast, at which time she objected. 
  The appellant proceeded to sexually assault her. Afterwards, he told her not 
  to tell anyone. They walked back to the camp. Approximately two years after 
  the incident, the complainant told a friend what had happened and the police 
  were contacted.</p>
<p>
  [4] A.P. had been a friend of the complainant's since kindergarten. She was 
  also a cadet who went on the overnight camping trip. She testified that the 
  complainant and the appellant went for a walk. She started walking with them 
  but turned back because she was wearing new boots. Some time later, the complainant 
  came back to the fire pit. The complainant looked really upset, said something 
  had happened, but did not want to talk about it. The complainant did not stay 
  at the fire pit for long.</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant testified that he was in the cadets and was on the overnight 
  camping trip. He recognized the complainant as someone in the cadets. He did 
  not recall having any conversation with her other than perhaps some group chit-chat. 
  He had no interest in the complainant, stating that he was not interested in 
  young girls. He denied going for a walk with the complainant or assaulting her.</p>
<p>
  [6] The trial judge found the appellant guilty of sexual interference. He made 
  credibility findings in favour of the complainant and A.P., and found that A.P.'s 
  testimony corroborated that of the complainant. He also found that the accused 
  had lied when he said he did not take a walk with the complainant or assault 
  her, relying on the corroborative testimony of A.P. that the walk had taken 
  place.</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant raises six issues on the finding of guilt appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Did the trial judge improperly shift the evidentiary burden, 
  thereby shifting the onus of proof to the appellant? </p>
<p class="indent">(2) Having found that the appellant deliberately lied, did the 
  trial judge err in using that finding as positive evidence of guilt?</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Did the trial judge err in permitting the Crown to cross-examine 
  the appellant on his unrelated prior misconduct?</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Did the trial judge err in failing to hold a voir dire as 
  to the voluntariness of the appellant's statement to the police before allowing 
  the Crown to cross-examine him on the statement?</p>
<p class="indent">(5) Did the trial judge erroneously rely on the complainant's 
  mood as being consistent with her having been sexually assaulted, without the 
  assistance of any expert testimony?</p>
<p class="indent">(6) Did the trial judge err in his application of the doctrine 
  of reasonable doubt, by approaching the case as a credibility contest?</p>
<p>
  [8] In the view that I take of the appeal, the trial judge did err on the first 
  and fourth issues. The two errors are sufficiently serious to require a new 
  trial. I can state my reasons for this conclusion in brief compass.</p>
<p>
  (1) Burden of Proof</p>
<p>
  [9] The trial judge discussed both the legal and evidentiary burdens of proof 
  in his reasons. At the outset, he emphasized that the legal burden is on the 
  Crown and never shifts to the defence. He then continued: </p>
<p class="indent"> And I am going to draw a distinction here between that burden, 
  i.e. the legal burden, and another type of burden which I will call the evidentiary 
  burden. The evidentiary burden is not the same as the legal burden and the evidentiary 
  burden shifts back and forth frequently between the Crown and the accused during 
  the course of a trial.</p>
<p class="indent">. . . Sometimes it does not shift. It does not shift from the 
  Crown to the accused if the Crown does not make out any sort of case which requires 
  this evidentiary burden to shift to the accused. No onus shifts on the accused 
  which is the nature of an evidentiary burden.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case at bar, the first question to be asked of myself, 
  by myself, is this - did the Crown State lead evidence which, after consideration, 
  resulted in the evidentiary burden shifting to the accused? And the answer to 
  that question is a simple one. The answer to that question is yes, the Crown 
  did lead evidence which shifted the evidentiary burden to the accused.</p>
<p>
  [10] The trial judge then reviewed the testimony of the witnesses. He concluded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [Where] the evidence of the accused and of the victim differs, the evidence 
  of the victim is to be preferred over that of the accused, based on my assessment 
  of the accused's demeanour when he was in the witness box; and, based on the 
  strength of the evidence given by the victim; based on the corroborative evidence 
  of [A.P.] which corroborates the evidence of the victim and gives the lie to 
  the evidence of the accused with respect to whether or not there was ever a 
  walk taken by him alone, not with others, alone with the victim.</p>
<p>
  [11] Immediately after that conclusion, the trial judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  So having made that finding, I am satisfied that the evidentiary burden which 
  shifted to the accused, that onus was not met by him; that therefore, the evidence 
  led by the Crown proves the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. 
  That onus never shifted to the accused. I made that clear at the beginning of 
  these reasons. It was an onus which never shifted, but that the evidentiary 
  onus did shift and he did not answer it to my satisfaction to the point where 
  he raises a doubt in my mind as to his guilt, which brings us back to the legal 
  onus of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [12] In my view, the reasons of the trial judge are problematic; indeed, Crown 
  counsel on the appeal referred to them as &quot;ambiguous and unusual&quot;. 
  There is a clear and useful discussion of the evidential burden in Sopinka, 
  Lederman and Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada (Toronto: Butterworths, 1999). 
  The authors state, at pp. 55, 61 and 71: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The term &quot;evidential burden&quot; means that a party has the responsibility 
  to insure that there is sufficient evidence of the existence or non-existence 
  of a fact or of an issue on the record to pass the threshold test for that particular 
  fact or issue.</p>
<p class="center"> . . . . . </p>
<p class="indent"> Normally, the incidence of the evidential burden coincides 
  with the legal burden of proof. For example, since the prosecution has the legal 
  burden in relation to all the definitional elements of the crime of sexual assault, 
  the Crown must adduce sufficient evidence on these elements to overcome a motion 
  for a directed verdict of acquittal. If the complainant testifies that the accused 
  applied non-consensual force in circumstances of sexuality and there is an evidential 
  basis to infer that the accused had the requisite mental state for the crime, 
  the prosecution has discharged its evidential burden&#133;.In the above circumstances, 
  the criminal law does not allocate an evidential burden to the accused to refute 
  the Crown's case and he or she may decline to adduce any evidence. Nevertheless, 
  if the accused decides not to call any evidence, he or she runs the risk of 
  being convicted and the failure to do so may increase the likelihood of an adverse 
  verdict. In the absence of any evidence of an excuse or justification, the trier 
  of fact may, not must, convict the accused, since in order to succeed the Crown 
  must also satisfy the legal burden of proof on the definitional elements of 
  the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="center"> . . . . .</p>
<p class="indent"> The authorities and the jurisprudence often refer to the shifting 
  of the evidential burden or the legal burden of proof. Except for the operation 
  of presumptions of law or rebuttable statutory provisions, these burdens do 
  not shift. [Emphasis added, citations omitted.]</p>
<p>
  [13] In my view, the reasons of the trial judge are not consistent with this 
  explanation. It is possible, I acknowledge, that his reasons could be viewed 
  as merely unfortunate language; after all, it is to some degree obvious from 
  the whole of the reasons that the trial judge believed the testimony of the 
  complainant, some of which was corroborated by A.P., and disbelieved the evidence 
  of the accused.</p>
<p>
  [14] However, in the end, I reach the conclusion that the manner in which the 
  trial judge articulated his reasons reflects an error of law. The trial judge 
  concluded that the evidence of the complainant was to be preferred over that 
  of the accused. Accordingly, the evidentiary burden shifted to the accused. 
  Since the accused did not meet that burden, he was found guilty. The reasons 
  make a direct link between the accused's failure to meet the evidentiary burden 
  and the trial judge's conclusion that the Crown proved its case beyond a reasonable 
  doubt.</p>
<p>
  [15] In my view, this is erroneous reasoning. The trial judge should not have 
  shifted the burden to the accused. He should have gone through the analysis 
  in R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 at 758: (1) if he believed the accused 
  - acquit; (2) if he did not believe the evidence of the accused but was left 
  in reasonable doubt by it - acquit; (3) if he was not left in doubt by the evidence 
  of the accused, he must ask himself whether, on the basis of the evidence he 
  did accept, he was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was 
  guilty.</p>
<p>
  [16] The trial judge did make a passing reference to W.(D.) in his reasons. 
  It also appears that he went through the first two steps of the W.(D.) analysis. 
  However, I cannot find anywhere in his reasons language that is consistent with 
  the third step. Instead, the trial judge shifted the evidentiary burden to the 
  accused, both at the start and near the end of his judgment, and found that 
  the accused had not met it. Unfortunately, the trial judge erred in adopting 
  this line of reasoning.</p>
<p>
  (2) Accused's statement to police - absence of voir dire re voluntariness</p>
<p>
  [17] The Crown concedes that the trial judge erred by not holding a voir dire 
  to determine the admissibility of the appellant's statement to the police: see 
  R. v. Erven, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 926, and R. v. Hodgson, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 449.</p>
<p>
  [18] The Crown contends, however, that the proviso in s. 686 of the Criminal 
  Code should be applied to cure the error relating to the absence of a voir dire 
  to determine the admissibility of the appellant's statement to the police. Although 
  I would reject this argument on the merits, the proviso issue does not arise 
  given my conclusion that the trial judge also erred with respect to the burden 
  of proof: see R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320 at 339, and R. v. Feeley (2001), 
  55 O.R. (3d) 481 at 490 (C.A.), aff'd 2003 SCC 7.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [19] I would allow the finding of guilt appeal and order a new trial. The disposition 
  appeal is moot.</p>
