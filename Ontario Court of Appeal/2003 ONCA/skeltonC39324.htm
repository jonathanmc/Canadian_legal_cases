<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The gravamen of these offences were the firearms offences. The trial judge 
  was of the view that these offences merited a one?year sentence. Although we 
  might have viewed them more seriously, we are satisfied that one year for these 
  offences was within an acceptable range. </p>
<p>
  [2] Where the trial judge then erred, in our opinion, was in imposing a consecutive 
  sentence of ten months for possession of a candlestick holder. That offence, 
  at best, merited a further sentence of one month. Thus, we conclude that a total 
  sentence of thirteen months on top of ten months pre?trial custody is a fit 
  sentence. Unfortunately, the trial judge did not, as he should have, specify 
  the credit he was giving for pretrial custody. In concluding that thirteen months 
  is a fit sentence, we take pre?trial custody into account on a two for one basis. 
  As the appellant has now served thirteen months, we vary his sentence to time 
  served. </p>
<p>
  [3] Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed 
  and the sentence is varied to time served. </p>
