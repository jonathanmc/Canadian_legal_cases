<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice J. Donohue of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 11, 2002.</p>
<p>McMURTRY C.J.O.:<br>
</p>
<p>OVERVIEW<br>
</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal by the Crown of the conditional sentence of two years 
  less one day plus probation, imposed by the Honourable Justice Donohue on June 
  11, 2002, following a plea of guilty to four counts of indecent assault, one 
  count of gross indecency, two counts of assault causing bodily harm, and two 
  counts of assault.<br>
</p>
<p>FACTS<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The sexual assaults occurred during a two-year period in 1978 and 1979 
  when the respondent was abusing alcohol. He repeatedly sexually fondled his 
  two daughters. He forced his daughter S. to perform oral sex on him when she 
  was eight or nine. The respondent also engaged in incidents of sexual touching 
  of his nieces who were ages 14 and 16 at the time. The sexual contact occurred 
  before the respondent joined Alcoholics Anonymous at the end of 1979. There 
  is no evidence that the respondent engaged in any sexual assaults after this 
  period although he physically abused both his spouse and daughters over a lengthy 
  period of time.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The first instance of domestic violence occurred during 1979 and involved 
  striking his wife in the eye. In or about 1985, the respondent slapped and punched 
  his wife, causing her injuries. On one occasion, he beat her on the head while 
  she was holding a baby.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] In 1986, the respondent's daughter S. was dating someone of whom he did 
  not approve. During two confrontations with his daughter about her boyfriend, 
  he slapped her across the face. On another occasion the same year, the respondent 
  picked up S. and threw her into the corner of the kitchen cabinets, bruising 
  her hips.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] In the spring of 1989 when S. was approximately 20, the respondent pushed 
  her violently several times against a garage door. On the same occasion, the 
  respondent threw hot tea in her face, scalding her. He then struck her violently 
  in the mouth with the back of his hand.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] When the respondent's older daughter A. was 16, he confronted her about 
  whether or not she had had sex, and beat her on her buttocks with a belt.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] The last incident of physical assault occurred in 1994 when his wife, from 
  whom he was separated and who was recovering from surgery, was pushed to the 
  ground and suffered injuries to her leg and her eye.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] The following table indicates the offences to which the respondent pleaded 
  guilty, a brief description of the relevant incidents referred to above and 
  the sentences imposed:</p>

<p>-SENTENCING<br>
</p>
<p>[9] At the respondent's sentencing, victim impact statements were filed by 
  his former wife and older daughter indicating that both had experienced significant 
  emotional trauma.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] The conditional sentence imposed was strict house arrest for two years 
  less a day, the maximum number of community service hours, and other conditions 
  including the following:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) House arrest for the first 12 months except for 
  medical, dental or spiritual purposes and Saturday morning for general shopping 
  from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) House arrest for the second 12 months as above except 
  to allow for gainful employment only, not to exceed 58 hours a week including 
  travel time;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) Other exceptions to house arrest as authorized by 
  the Supervisor;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) Perform 240 hours of Community Service work. This 
  work to commence within 30 days and to be completed at a rate of not less than 
  20 hours per month and shall be completed within 18 months;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) Attend and comply with treatment program as ordered 
  by Dr. Komer;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) Abstain from the purchase, possession or consumption 
  of drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription;</p>
<p class="indent">(g) Abstain from the purchase, possession or consumption 
  of alcohol;</p>
<p class="indent">(h) Not associate or communicate directly or indirectly 
  with the complainants;</p>
<p class="indent">(i) Make reasonable efforts to find and maintain suitable 
  full-time employment.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] In this appeal, the Crown is seeking a penitentiary sentence and argues, 
  in particular, that the sentences for the offences which are listed in (a) and 
  (d) in paragraph 9 are inadequate. <br>
</p>
<p>ANALYSIS<br>
</p>
<p>[12] I agree with the appellant's submission that the sentencing judge misapprehended 
  the evidence in relation to the number of times that the respondent assaulted 
  his two daughters. He stated that the counts which are numbered as (a) and (d) 
  above for the purpose of this appeal dealt with isolated incidents. In fact, 
  the agreed statement of facts stated that the sexual fondling of the respondent's 
  two daughters occurred repeatedly.<br>
</p>
<p>[13] The trial judge described the indecent assault on the respondent's daughter 
  S. as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Count number four was an indecent assault, in the nature 
  of touching S.'s vagina over her panties, occurring sometime between 1978 and 
  1979.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] In the statement of agreed facts, the sexual assault was described as 
  follows:<br>
  S. was sexually assaulted by her father repeatedly during this period using 
  a &quot;tickling game&quot; fondling scenario. Her father would start to tickle 
  her and be so aggressive with it that she would end up on the floor. He would 
  then rub her neck and abdominal areas before moving to her vagina and chest, 
  on top of her clothing, using the flat of his fingers.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] The indecent assault on his older daughter A. was described by the trial 
  judge as follows:<br>
  This took the form of groin rubbing while A. was seated in the accused's lap 
  and steering the family car and, in addition, an incident of chest fondling.<br>
</p>
<p>[16] The agreed statement of facts in relation to A. referred to her recollection 
  of being several times with her father in his car when her father's hands were 
  rubbing her inner thighs next to her vagina.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] The trial judge described the sexual offences as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">These counts basically characterize individual incidents. 
  These are not counts which capture a lengthy course of depredation upon the 
  victim.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] When these counts are considered with the gross indecency count which 
  involved the forcing of S. to assist him in masturbation of himself and, in 
  addition, forcing her to perform fellatio on him, I respectfully do not agree 
  with the trial judge that the offences can be described as individual incidents 
  and not a lengthy course of depredation of the victims. The incidents involve 
  repeated sexual assaults by the respondent on his daughter S. and more than 
  one on his daughter A., as well as on his nieces. These assaults clearly represent 
  a course of depredation of over two years on the victims, in respect of all 
  of whom the respondent was in a position of trust.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] This court has indicated in previous cases that, in the absence of exceptional 
  circumstances, a penitentiary sentence is generally required in cases of sexual 
  abuse of children where there has been a breach of trust. See: R. v. Cromien 
  [2002] O.J. No. 354 (C.A.) at 7, and R. v. Bedard (2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 216 
  (Ont. C.A.).<br>
</p>
<p>[20] Although the trial judge referred to the appropriate sentencing objectives 
  and principles, the sentences imposed, particularly with respect to the two 
  indecent assaults referred to above which involved the respondent's daughters, 
  fail to reflect the seriousness of the offences and are simply inadequate. Although 
  the appellant for the purpose of this appeal, given the global nature of the 
  sentences, is not asking us to increase the seven-month sentence imposed in 
  relation to the gross indecency conviction, that sentence, in my view, was extraordinarily 
  lenient. <br>
</p>
<p>[21] The trial judge was undoubtedly impressed by what he described as the 
  respondent's &quot;remarkable personal achievements.&quot; He mentioned the 
  fact that the respondent, who is now 53 years old, had immigrated to Canada 
  and had upgraded his trade into a university degree, and ultimately had a 20-year 
  career as a teacher. The respondent lost his position as a teacher and at the 
  time of sentencing, was an unemployed truck driver living in his truck cab. 
  The trial judge noted that the respondent and his former wife had adopted two 
  children from Korea but these children are now Crown wards. He now has a new 
  spouse and a child of grade-school age, but a family court order removed the 
  respondent from his home after he was charged with the offences that are the 
  subject of this appeal.<br>
</p>
<p>[22] The trial judge also noted that a &quot;highly regarded&quot; psychiatrist 
  who examined the respondent had expressed his opinion that the respondent does 
  not show any of the characteristics of paedophilia.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] The sentencing judge also made reference to the fact that the &quot;incidents 
  of sexual abuse &#133; occurred during a two year period when the accused was 
  recovering from a shattering construction injury which had caused considerable 
  permanent damage to his spine &#133; and [that] he abused alcohol during that 
  period.&quot;<br>
</p>
<p>[24] In sentencing the respondent, the trial judge appeared to place great 
  emphasis on the Supreme Court of Canada decision of R. v. L.F.W. [2001] 1 S.C.R. 
  132 which upheld a conditional sentence in a case that the trial judge stated 
  &quot;bears certain similarities.&quot; In L.F.W., the accused was convicted 
  of one count of indecent assault and one count of gross indecency. The offences 
  were committed between 1967 and 1973 and at the time the victim, who was the 
  respondent's first cousin, was between 6 and 12 years old. The respondent was 
  between 22 and 28 years old.<br>
</p>
<p>[25] There were 10 to 12 incidents involving forced masturbation and fellatio 
  at a time when the respondent in L.F.W. was abusing alcohol. Most of the incidents 
  occurred in a locked shed next to the complainant's home. The complainant was 
  warned not to tell anyone about what transpired, particularly her parents. The 
  respondent told the victim that he had a gun, leading her to believe that her 
  family would be endangered if she told anyone about the events.<br>
</p>
<p>[26] The respondent in L.F.W., a widower, had four children and has resided 
  in Bay de Verde his whole life, except for three years spent in the armed forces. 
  He had no criminal record and a good work record. He was close to and had the 
  support of his four children, for whom he had provided throughout their lives. 
  There were letters from respected leaders of his community attesting to his 
  good character and reputation in the community.<br>
</p>
<p>[27] The respondent in L.F.W. was sentenced to a 21-month conditional sentence. 
  The Crown appealed, seeking a 21-month term of incarceration. A majority of 
  the Newfoundland Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. Cameron J.A. dissenting, 
  would have ordered the respondent to serve the remainder of his sentence in 
  prison.<br>
</p>
<p>[28] The evenly split Supreme Court in L.F.W. referred to its decision in R. 
  v. Proulx, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 61 where it reiterated that the sentence imposed 
  by a trial judge is entitled to considerable deference from appellate courts. 
  The court also referred to R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500 at para. 90 
  where it was stated that:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">[A]bsent an error in principle, failure to consider 
  a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of 
  appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if it is demonstrably 
  unfit.<br>
</p>
<p>[29] There are important differences between this case and L.F.W. Although 
  L.F.W. took advantage of a family relationship in his abuse of his cousin, he 
  was not in a parental relationship with her. That is not the case here. Two 
  of the victims were the respondent's daughters. He also abused his position 
  of trust in assaulting two nieces who were visiting his home, and in assaulting 
  his wife. Further, in this case, unlike L.F.W., there were multiple victims 
  and a pattern of criminal conduct extending over almost 15 years. Finally, in 
  this case, unlike L.F.W., the trial judge misapprehended the facts in material 
  ways that led him to minimize the seriousness of the offences, especially the 
  indecent assaults on the respondent's daughters.<br>
</p>
<p>[30] Ordinarily, these offences would require imposition of a penitentiary 
  sentence of at least three years, notwithstanding the passage of time since 
  the most serious offences were committed. This was not an appropriate case for 
  a conditional sentence. Having regard to the gravity and repeated nature of 
  the respondent's abuses, the objectives of general deterrence and denunciation 
  could not be met by a conditional sentence, even with the strict punitive terms 
  imposed by the trial judge.<br>
</p>
<p>[31] Determining the appropriate sentence at this stage is a matter of some 
  difficulty. Since the respondent has already served over six months of the conditional 
  sentence under strict terms, he is entitled to credit for that time. In all 
  of the circumstances I also do not think that it would be in the public interest 
  to now incarcerate the respondent in a penitentiary. I am also taking into consideration 
  that the respondent's life has suffered rather catastrophic consequences as 
  a result of his arrest on these charges.<br>
</p>
<p>[32] Some comment should be made about the sentences actually imposed by the 
  trial judge. The trial judge imposed sentences of one month for the indecent 
  assault of S. and for the indecent assault of A. Those sentences were manifestly 
  inadequate given the very serious conduct involved.<br>
</p>
<p>CONCLUSION<br>
</p>
<p>[33] Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and vary 
  the sentence as follows:<br>
</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%"> 
      <p>(a) Indecent assault on S. </p></td>
    <td width="50%">7 months imprisonment</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%">(b) Gross indecency involving S.</td>
    <td width="50%">9 months concurrent</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%">(c) Assault causing bodily harm of S.</td>
    <td width="50%">4 months consecutive</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%">(d) Indecent assault on A.</td>
    <td width="50%">7 months consecutive</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%">(e) Assault on S.</td>
    <td width="50%">1 month concurrent</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%">(f) Indecent assault on niece</td>
    <td width="50%">1 month consecutive</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%">(g) Indecent assault on another niece</td>
    <td width="50%">5 months consecutive</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="50%" height="17">(h) Assault on wife</td>
    <td width="50%" height="17"> 1 month concurrent with two years probation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"> 
      <p>(i) Assault causing bodily harm on wife </p></td>
    <td width="50%">2 months consecutive</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>[34] The total sentence is therefore twenty-eight months imprisonment. Were 
  it not for the need to give effect to the totality principle, some of the individual 
  sentences would be much longer and some of the sentences that I have made concurrent 
  would be consecutive.</p>
<p>[35] As I stated earlier, the respondent should be given six months credit 
  for the six months of the conditional sentence that he has already served. The 
  total sentence that I am imposing will therefore be twenty-two months imprisonment 
  to commence from the day that the respondent surrenders into custody.<br>
