<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, given the facts at the time of the proceedings before Howden 
  J., he made no error in principle in imposing a custodial sentence of fifteen 
  months, together with a restitution order. The custodial sentence, on the facts 
  then known, was fit. </p>
<p> [2] The fresh evidence tendered by the appellant before this court, however, 
  which we admit, establishes that the appellant has made restitution to date 
  in the sum of $103,000 concerning the offences at issue before Howden J. and 
  other offences that were committed within the same general time frame. Thus, 
  the appellant has made significant rehabilitative efforts. Further, he is committed 
  to making full restitution. </p>
<p> [3] Importantly, the fresh evidence also indicates that in August 2001, after 
  the sentencing hearing before Howden J., the appellant entered a plea of guilty 
  on an unrelated fraud charge concerning conduct which occurred one year prior 
  to the conduct forming the subject-matter of the charges before Howden J. In 
  April 2002, Minden J. of the Superior Court of Justice accepted a joint sentencing 
  submission from the Crown and the defence and imposed a conditional sentence 
  of twelve months, which included terms of house arrest, in respect of that charge. 
  By its participation in the joint submission, the Crown recognized that the 
  appellant is an appropriate candidate for a conditional sentence, his incarceration 
  is not required to protect the public, and he is capable of serving a sentence 
  in the community without the risk of reoffending. The appellant subsequently 
  served his twelve month conditional sentence without incident.</p>
<p>[4] In these circumstances, given the unusual and compelling fresh evidence, 
  we are of the view that the appeal should be allowed on the authority of R. 
  v. Levesque (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C). The custodial sentence imposed 
  by the trial judge is set aside and a conditional sentence of two years less 
  one day is substituted in its stead subject to the same terms as the conditional 
  sentence imposed by Minden J. on April 22, 2002, including house arrest, and 
  the further term that in each year the appellant shall make restitution in the 
  sum of $15,000, at the rate of at least $1,000 per month. The conditional sentence 
  shall be followed by probation for three years during which the appellant shall 
  again be required to make restitution each year in the amount of $15,000 at 
  the rate of at least $1,000 per month. If the Crown and the defence are unable 
  to agree on the remaining terms of the probation order, they may make written 
  submissions concerning same to the Registrar of this court within ten days from 
  the date hereof.</p>
