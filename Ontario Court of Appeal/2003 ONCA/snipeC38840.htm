<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the trial judge was entitled to find that the appellant had 
  not met the likely relevance test to meet the threshold for initial production 
  of the records to the trial judge under s. 278.5 of the Criminal Code. </p>
<p>[2] While the complainant had pre-existing psychiatric problems, there was 
  nothing in the evidence to show that those problems could have had any impact 
  on her credibility or the reliability of her evidence. </p>
<p>[3] The appellant also relies on inconsistencies between the complainant&#146;s 
  initial complaints and her preliminary inquiry trial testimony. The appellant 
  points out that the period of counselling intervened between the initial complaints 
  and the preliminary inquiry.</p>
<p>[4] While there were some minor inconsistencies, they were not material in 
  the sense referred to by this court in R. v. Batte (2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 449 
  at para. 76. The only alleged major inconsistency concerned the hospital form 
  that appeared to show a complaint of anal sex. However, there is no basis for 
  attributing this part of the hospital form to the complainant. The other material 
  is virtually conclusive that the complainant made no complaint of anal sex.</p>
<p>[5] The other inconsistencies relate to minor matters such as the order in 
  which certain events occurred. The requirement that the inconsistencies be material 
  is to ensure that records are not produced solely on the basis of stereotypical 
  beliefs about the conduct of complainants in sexual assault cases or about persons 
  with mental disabilities. </p>
<p>[6] We would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>[7] The appellant&#146;s other ground of appeal was the trial judge failed 
  to set out the theory of defence and relate the evidence to that theory. We 
  think this is one of those rare cases where this was not necessary. The theory 
  of defence is set out in defence counsel&#146;s jury address immediately before 
  the charge to the jury, was almost wholly speculative and any fair presentation 
  of it would have required that this be pointed out to the jury. This would account, 
  in our view, for the lack of objection by experienced counsel. </p>
<p>[8] We would therefore not give effect to this ground of appeal. Accordingly 
  the appeal from conviction is dismissed. </p>
<p>[9] As to sentence, while the appellant was virtually a first offender, this 
  was a most serious offence and required a penitentiary sentence. The appellant 
  raped a 15-year-old girl causing her injuries. The appellant has suffered some 
  health reversals but, in our view, they cannot justify interfering with the 
  trial judge&#146;s sentence. While we are conscious on the immigration consequences, 
  this is not a case where those consequences weigh so heavily that we would be 
  justified in reducing the sentence to a reformatory term. </p>
<p>[10] Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is 
  dismissed.</p>
