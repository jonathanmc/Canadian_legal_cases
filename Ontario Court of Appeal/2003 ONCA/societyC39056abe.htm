<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] Dilks J. had a discretion whether or not to grant the adjournment and we 
  are not persuaded that he erred in the exercise of that discretion. The appellant 
  had ample time to prepare materials to respond to the application and had been 
  put on notice that he should provide materials and that the respondent would 
  be opposing any further adjournments.</p>    <P>
  [2] The proposed fresh evidence concerning whether the appellant was bound by 
  the earlier judgement and the stop-loss insurance was available well before 
  the application and the appellant has not provided any satisfactory explanation 
  for the lack of diligence in presenting the evidence before the application 
  judge. That fresh evidence is not admissible. The respondent concedes that the 
  information concerning the New York litigation was not available at the time 
  of the application. That information would not, however, change the result. 
  It merely confirms the view of the application judge that there is no quick 
  end in sight to that litigation and the possibility that the appellant would 
  be able to satisfy the whole or a substantial part of the judgment with the 
  credit notes is still speculative.</p>    <P>
  [3] The appellant has not demonstrated he had any defence to the application 
  and given the history of this matter the adjournment application was properly 
  dismissed.</p>    
<P> [4] The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $1,500 inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
