<p>On appeal from conviction for second degree murder by Justice William Morrison 
  of the Superior Court of Justice, and a jury, on December 17, 1997 and from 
  the sentence of life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 14 years 
  imposed on December 19, 1997.</p>

<p>
  MOLDAVER J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] On December 17, 1997, after a 56-day trial before Justice W. A. Morrison 
  and a jury, the appellant was convicted of second degree murder. On December 
  19, 1997, he was sentenced to life imprisonment and his period of parole ineligibility 
  was increased from ten to fourteen years.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant appeals from both conviction and sentence. If successful on 
  his conviction appeal, he seeks a new trial; if unsuccessful, he seeks a reduction 
  in the period of his parole ineligibility. For reasons that follow, I would 
  dismiss the appeal in its entirety.</p>
<p>
  OVERVIEW</p>

<p>
  [3] The appellant was charged on July 10, 1995 with the murder of his wife, 
  Kamlesh. Three days earlier, on July 7, Kamlesh was strangled to death. Her 
  lifeless body was discovered on the night of the 7th at around 11:30 p.m. by 
  a passing motorist. She had been dumped at the side of a rural road north of 
  Milton. It was about a half-hour drive from that location to her home in Brampton.</p>
<p>
  [4] Four hours earlier, at 7:30 p.m., Kamlesh and the appellant were at home 
  alone. After that, until the discovery of her body, Kamlesh was not heard from 
  or seen by anyone other than the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [5] The sole issue at trial was the identity of Kamlesh's killer. The 
  appellant did not testify, but in a pre-arrest videotaped statement introduced 
  by the Crown, he denied killing his wife. In support of his denial, he relied 
  on the evidence of family members and others who attested to the soundness of 
  his marriage and the lack of any apparent motive on his part to kill Kamlesh. 
  He also relied on the evidence of an independent witness who claimed that at 
  8:30 p.m. on the night of July 7, when the appellant was definitely at home 
  in Brampton, she saw the Sodhi family Chrysler Concorde being driven by someone 
  on a street in Milton. If reliable, her evidence created a serious problem for 
  the Crown since it was the Crown's position that the appellant killed 
  Kamlesh in the family home sometime between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. and then 
  used the Chrysler Concorde to dispose of her body. </p>
<p>
  [6] Against the evidence favouring the appellant, the Crown adduced a massive 
  body of circumstantial evidence designed to show that the appellant was indeed 
  the killer, that he killed Kamlesh in the family home, and that after disposing 
  of her body, he took steps to cover up his crime by making it appear as if she 
  had been robbed and murdered by a stranger. </p>
<p>
  [7] As will become apparent when I review the salient features of the evidence, 
  the circumstantial case implicating the appellant as the killer was virtually 
  insurmountable. That fact was not lost on the appellant. It explains why, in 
  the last analysis, he was forced to rely on the fanciful theory that after Kamlesh 
  was murdered, the real killer broke into his home and his white Ford van and 
  planted incriminating evidence in an effort to frame him for a crime he did 
  not commit.</p>
<p>
  [8] My characterization of that theory as fanciful foreshadows the outcome of 
  this appeal. As will be seen, it allows for the safe application of the curative 
  proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 to overcome 
  the one error of law that, in my view, the appellant has made out on this record. 
  I will address that error and the facts surrounding it in due course. It involves 
  the improper admission of statements made by the appellant to the police on 
  July 18, eight days after his arrest. For now, I propose to review the facts 
  that are germane to the central issue in this case, namely, whether the appellant 
  killed Kamlesh in the family home or whether she was killed by a stranger outside 
  the home.</p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant's wife was strangled to death some time after 7:30 p.m. 
  on Friday, July 7, 1995. That night, at around 11:30 p.m., a passing motorist 
  discovered her lifeless body in a ditch alongside a rural road north of Milton. 
  Forensic evidence established that she had not been killed at the place where 
  her body was found. The vegetation surrounding her body was undisturbed and 
  her feet, though bare, were clean. Forensic testing also revealed that Kamlesh 
  had not been sexually assaulted and apart from a ligature mark that encircled 
  her neck, no other injuries were detected. A pinkish-orange substance, presumably 
  vomit, was dripping from her nose and mouth. Most of the jewellery that she 
  had been wearing was missing. All that remained was a silver bracelet of religious 
  significance referred to as a "Kara". </p>
<p>
  [10] Kamlesh's body was located about a half-hour drive from her home 
  in Brampton. Earlier that evening, at 7:30 p.m., she and the appellant were 
  at home alone. At that time, they placed a long distance call to Cornwall to 
  extend birthday greetings to their brother-in-law. When no one picked up the 
  phone, they left a voice message. Until her body was discovered at 11:30 p.m., 
  Kamlesh was not heard from or seen by anyone other than the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [11] According to the appellant, after completing the phone call to Cornwall, 
  he and Kamlesh ate a quick dinner consisting of pop and nachos. Kamlesh then 
  left in the red Chrysler Concorde to do some shopping for a family outing to 
  Canada's Wonderland the next day. </p>
<p>
  [12] In three statements made to three different people within twelve hours 
  of the time that Kamlesh was supposed to have left the house, the appellant 
  variously described her departure time as 8:30 p.m., 7:00 to 7:30 p.m. and 7:30 
  to 7:45 p.m. The appellant also gave inconsistent statements regarding the shoes 
  that Kamlesh was wearing when she left. In a statement to the police, he claimed 
  that she was wearing a jogging suit and black shoes. To a family member who 
  confronted him with the fact that none of the shoes that Kamlesh normally wore 
  when driving the car were missing, he denied knowing what shoes she was wearing 
  because he had been in the washroom when she left. That statement was inconsistent 
  with a third statement to another family member in which the appellant stated 
  that he had kissed Kamlesh goodbye as she was leaving. In a similar vein, the 
  appellant told the police that he had given Kamlesh $100.00 in cash to do the 
  shopping and that he had kept $50.00 for himself. Later, however, when the police 
  searched the blue jeans that he had been wearing at the time of her alleged 
  departure, they discovered $150.00 in cash, precisely the amount of money he 
  had withdrawn earlier that day from the bank. The bank teller who served him 
  testified that the denominations of the bills found in his pocket were the same 
  as those she had given to him. </p>
<p>
  [13] At about 8:30 p.m., the appellant received a phone call from his tenant, 
  Mr. Lalsingh. Mr. Lalsingh and his wife occupied a self-contained basement apartment 
  in the appellant's home. Mr. Lalsingh was calling to inquire about some 
  appliances that he believed the appellant had for sale. The first call, placed 
  at around 8:30 p.m., went unanswered. A second call, placed a few minutes later, 
  was answered by the appellant. The two men spoke briefly. According to Mr. Lalsingh, 
  the appellant sounded less friendly than usual. </p>
<p>
  [14] At 9:00 p.m., the appellant telephoned his sister-in-law's home to 
  speak to his two children who were spending the night there. After that, he 
  was not heard from or seen by anyone until 11:15 p.m.</p>
<p>
  [15] According to the appellant, between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., he started 
  to worry about Kamlesh because she had not returned home. As a result, he got 
  into his white Ford van and drove around to various stores but could not find 
  her. At 11:00 p.m., he returned home and placed another call to his sister-in-law's 
  home. His brother-in-law, Vijay, answered the phone and told him that Kamlesh 
  was not there. Sometime between 11:15 p.m. and 11:30 p.m., while he was still 
  speaking to Vijay, the appellant's nephew, Sanjeev (who was staying with 
  the appellant and Kamlesh for the summer), returned home from work. A short 
  time later, Vijay and various members of his family arrived at the appellant's 
  home. Some of them went to look for Kamlesh, while Sanjeev remained at home 
  for the remainder of the night. The appellant and another family member drove 
  to a police station to report Kamlesh missing. Before doing so, the appellant 
  changed his clothing. </p>
<p>
  [16] Upon returning home from the police station, the appellant retrieved some 
  photographs of Kamlesh. After dropping the photos off at the police station, 
  he, Vijay and another relative began to search for Kamlesh. As they drove up 
  Highway 10, the appellant told Vijay to drive to various stores and plazas. 
  Eventually, at around 1:00 a.m., they arrived at a plaza on the south-east corner 
  of Kennedy Road and Clarence Street in Brampton. It was there that the appellant 
  spotted the family Chrysler Concorde. The distance between the plaza and the 
  appellant's home was 5.7 kilometres. </p>
<p>
  [17] Kamlesh, of course, was nowhere to be found. At that point, no one in the 
  appellant's search party knew that her body had already been discovered. 
  Upon looking inside the car, it was obvious to all that the interior had been 
  vandalized. The upholstery was slashed and the inside of the car was covered 
  with yellow spray paint.</p>
<p>
  [18] Kamlesh's purse was found on top of the gear shift. That is where 
  she normally kept it. It was speckled with yellow spray paint. The contents 
  of her purse were missing. Forensic evidence established that the purse had 
  been placed over the gearshift after the car had been spray-painted. A pair 
  of black dress shoes was found on the front passenger floor. They too were speckled 
  with yellow paint.</p>
<p>
  [19] The trunk of the car was completely empty. Even the window washer fluid 
  that Kamlesh normally kept there was missing. Noteably, on Thursday night, July 
  6, the family had gone to a drive-in movie and they had stored blankets, chairs 
  and a cooler in the trunk. Upon returning home from the drive-in, it was decided 
  that those items would be left in the trunk until the following day. On Friday 
  afternoon, July 7, when Sanjeev left for work at 1:45 p.m., they were nowhere 
  in sight. When he returned home from work at around 11:25 p.m., he found them 
  stored in the front hall by the front door. At no time did the appellant explain 
  how or when those items came to be in the front hall.</p>
<p>
  [20] On Saturday morning, July 8, the appellant provided the police with a lengthy 
  video-taped statement in which he described his activities on July 7, both before 
  and after Kamlesh's disappearance. While waiting to be interviewed, he 
  remarked to Vijay, "how one minute can change one's whole life". 
  Asked later what he meant by that, he stated that one minute everything was 
  fine and the next, all this happened.</p>
<p>
  [21] In his statement to the police, the appellant described, among other things, 
  how Kamlesh was dressed when she left to go shopping and what jewellery she 
  was wearing. Towards the end of the interview, he was told that a body, believed 
  to be that of Kamlesh, had been found. When asked if he had any idea who might 
  have wanted to hurt her or why she had been killed, he stated that he had "no 
  idea". To his knowledge, she had no enemies and everyone loved her. He 
  denied killing her or being responsible for her death. </p>
<p>
  [22] After finishing at the police station, the appellant was escorted home 
  by the police. While at home, he changed his clothes and turned over to the 
  police the clothing he was wearing. Unbeknownst to the police, the clothing 
  that he turned over was not the clothing he had been wearing when his nephew, 
  Sanjeev, returned home from work on Friday night. Rather, it was the clothing 
  into which he had changed before going to the police station to report Kamlesh 
  missing. </p>
<p>
  [23] After turning over his clothes, the appellant was driven by the police 
  to the home of his sister-in-law where his two children were staying. The time 
  was now 12:25 p.m. Shortly after his arrival, the appellant locked himself in 
  the bathroom and refused to come out. After twenty minutes, he opened the door 
  and went to his children. It was then that he told them that their mother was 
  dead. He was very emotional and tearful at the time.</p>
<p>
  [24] At about 2:00 p.m., Kamlesh's eldest sister, Asha, arrived. She had 
  come from Cornwall. As the eldest sibling, she was viewed as a mother figure 
  by the appellant and Kamlesh. When the appellant realized that she was at the 
  front door, he locked the door and said to Vijay, "I can't face 
  her". He then asked for the keys to Vijay's car and left the house 
  through the garage. Some time later, when asked by Asha why he had bolted, he 
  said that "he could not look her straight in the eye" and that "he 
  would have been compelled to tell her everything". When she asked him 
  what he meant by "everything", he said "he couldn't 
  say, he had been asked by his lawyer not to say anything to anyone". He 
  also stated that "he needed some time to think things over". </p>
<p>
  [25] After leaving in Vijay's jeep, the appellant (who by now was under 
  police surveillance), drove to a hardware store where he purchased two large 
  exacto knives and a roll of duct tape. He then drove to a park on Lakeshore 
  Road near Oakville, got out of the car, and walked towards the shore of Lake 
  Ontario. A short time later, the police officer who had been following him found 
  him sitting on a rock, clutching an exacto knife. He had slashed his neck and 
  left wrist. He was immediately rushed to the hospital. </p>
<p>
  [26] In Vijay's jeep, the police located a number of documents prepared 
  by the appellant, including a hand-written will and a note to his two children. 
  In the note to the children, he told them how much he and Kamlesh loved them 
  and that he had to leave them to be with her. </p>
<p>
  [27] While he was recuperating in the Oakville Trafalgar Hospital from his suicide 
  attempt, the appellant was arrested for Kamlesh's murder. Prior to arresting 
  him, the police conducted a thorough search of his home, his white Ford van 
  and the clothes that he was wearing at the time of his attempted suicide. Those 
  searches revealed a host of items connecting the appellant to Kamlesh's 
  disappearance and death. Many of them are listed below. Their discovery created 
  a huge dilemma for the appellant. As indicated, his only explanation was one 
  that required the jury to speculate that the real killer had planted them in 
  an effort to frame him. </p>
<p>
  Items located in the laundry room</p>
<p> [28] In the laundry room of the appellant's home, the police found: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li> a light shell jacket on the washing machine; it contained a pinkish-orange 
    substance on the sleeve similar to the substance seen leaking from Kamlesh's 
    nose and mouth; and</li>
  <li> a plastic bag in a laundry basket on top of the dryer; it contained the 
    contents of Kamlesh's purse, including her wallet, identification, credit 
    cards, papers, letters and $12 in cash; also found in the bag were two blue 
    and red bandanas, which were normally kept in the Chrysler Concorde and used 
    by the appellant and his son to cover their heads when entering a Sikh temple.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Items found in the appellant's master bedroom and blue jeans</p>
<p> [29] In the master bedroom, the police located the jeans that the appellant 
  had been wearing when Sanjeev returned home from work on Friday night at around 
  11:25 p.m. The following items were located in the pockets of his jeans: </p>
<ul>
  <li>a set of protective glasses sprinkled with yellow-paint;</li>
  <li> $150 in cash in the same denominations that the appellant had received 
    from the bank on the afternoon of July 7;</li>
  <li> a wallet containing a photograph of the appellant on his honeymoon and 
    a special note to Kamlesh from her son that Kamlesh normally kept in her purse;</li>
  <li> a bobby pin; and</li>
  <li> a set of keys to the appellant's white Ford van (this set was in 
    addition to the set found on the appellant at the time of his attempted suicide).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Items located in the white Ford van</p>
<p> [30] Inside the appellant's van, the police located a plastic bag behind 
  the driver's seat. It was spotted with yellow paint and contained: </p>
<ul>
  <li> a blue Brooks jacket (which the appellant's daughter had seen before, 
    probably at her house); it had yellow paint on it and two pinkish-orange stains, 
    one located on the right shoulder and the other on the lower right back. </li>
</ul>
<p>[31] On the inside pockets of the Brooks jacket, the police found: </p>
<ul>
  <li> a black cloth belt likely used to strangle Kamlesh; among other things, 
    it contained specks of yellow paint and skin fragments matching Kamlesh's 
    DNA profile;</li>
  <li> five rings (all cut in two or three places), two cut gold bracelets and 
    a chain bracelet which belonged to Kamlesh; the rings had been cut from her 
    fingers;</li>
  <li> two audiocassettes from the Chrysler Concorde, each sprinkled with yellow 
    paint; and</li>
  <li> a set of Chrysler keys with yellow paint on them (the van and house keys 
    that should have been on the same key ring were missing). </li>
</ul>
<p> [32] Other plastic bags were found in the van. They too had yellow paint on 
  them and contained: </p>
<ul>
  <li> a welder's hammer and an exacto knife; each was spotted with yellow 
    paint and each had been used to cause damage to the upholstery in the Concorde;</li>
  <li> a set of wire cutters spotted with yellow paint, which had been used to 
    cut the rings off of Kamlesh's fingers;</li>
  <li> a pair of latex gloves with yellow paint on them;</li>
  <li> a cap from a spray-paint can with a bar code identifying it as "sunshine 
    yellow", a brand of paint sold at Canadian Tire stores; and</li>
  <li> a terry cloth towel, stiff with yellow paint, recognized by the appellant's 
    daughter as having come from the kitchen of their home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Items located in the clothing worn by the appellant at the time of his attempted 
  suicide</p>
<p> [33] Inside the clothing worn by the appellant at the time of his attempted 
  suicide, the police found: </p>
<ul>
  <li> a pair of pearl-clustered earrings that Kamlesh had worn to work on July 
    7, the day she was murdered; </li>
  <li>a pair of gold coloured studs, which according to her sisters, Rajni and 
    Asha, Kamlesh "always" or "almost always" wore;</li>
  <li> Kamlesh's watch, which according to Rajni, Kamlesh "always" 
    wore;</li>
  <li> a Kara bracelet with yellow paint on it belonging to the appellant;</li>
  <li> two photos of the appellant and family members; and</li>
  <li> the appellant's wallet with his identification, credit cards and 
    over $100 in Canadian currency.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [34] According to Rajni, within several weeks of Kamlesh's murder, she 
  asked the appellant how he had come to have various items of Kamlesh's 
  jewellery in his pockets at the time of his attempted suicide. He responded 
  by saying that he had seen the items in the bedroom when the police brought 
  him home to change his clothes on the morning of the 8th. He said it was then 
  that he had put them in the pants he was wearing at the time of his attempted 
  suicide. When asked by Rajni why he had not reported his finding to the police 
  officers, he said that if he had told them, "they wouldn't have 
  let him go and see his kids".</p>
<p>
  [35] As indicated, the appellant did not testify. In an effort to counter the 
  case against him, he relied upon his July 8th statement to the police, evidence 
  obtained through cross-examination of various Crown witnesses, and evidence 
  called by the defence. </p>
<p>
  [36] Within the Crown's case, a number of family members and others attested 
  to the soundness of the appellant's marriage and the lack of any apparent 
  motive on his part to kill Kamlesh. Certainly, no one knew of any prior violence 
  in the marriage.</p>
<p>
  [37] With respect to the adequacy of the police investigation, cross-examination 
  revealed that the police had failed to conduct DNA testing on certain items. 
  As well, it was suggested that the police had failed to adequately investigate 
  a dispute between the appellant and some members of the Nanaksar Temple dating 
  back to 1994. The dispute related to electrical work the appellant had done 
  for the temple and the money he claimed was owing to him. In his "day 
  book" for February 1994, the appellant recorded some of the highlights 
  of the dispute. The entries indicated that he had been threatened but that someone 
  from the temple apologized to him the next day. Later that month, according 
  to the entries, he was paid most of the monies owing to him.</p>
<p>
  [38] The police were made aware of the temple incident. They interviewed the 
  president of the temple but no one else. They also reviewed a journal from the 
  temple that identified the meetings referred to in the appellant's daybook. 
  The detective in charge of the investigation testified that the incident at 
  the temple "was not a high priority" and that no further steps were 
  taken to investigate the matter. </p>
<p>
  [39] Within the defence case, evidence was led to provide an innocent explanation 
  for the yellow paint found on the appellant's safety glasses and his Kara. 
  In particular, it was established that between May 11 and June 12, 1995, in 
  the course of his work, the appellant had been using yellow and blue spray paint 
  on electrical conduit pipes and the yellow paint may have been the same type 
  as that found in the Chrysler Concorde and on the items retrieved from his van. 
  (Of note, however, no blue paint specks were found on either the safety glasses 
  or the appellant's Kara). </p>
<p>
  [40] The defence also relied on the evidence of Christine Myers, an independent 
  witness, who claimed that on Friday, July 7 at about 8:30 p.m., she saw a red 
  Chrysler Concorde with the licence plate "SODHI 1" being driven 
  by someone on a street in Milton. She took no notice of the occupant or occupants. 
  If her evidence was accurate, the appellant could not have been in the car. 
  At 8:30 p.m., he was at home speaking on the telephone to his tenant, Mr. Lalsingh. 
  </p>
<p>
  [41] Ms. Myers stated that she remembered the car and the time and date because 
  she was with her eleven-year old son and her son asked her about the licence 
  plate. She also noticed the car because it was bright red and it reminded her 
  of a car that she and her husband had been looking at. </p>
<p>
  [42] Five days later, on July 12, Ms. Myers read an article in a local newspaper 
  that referred to the Sodhi vehicle and the murder of Kamlesh. She could not 
  remember at first where it was that she had seen the car. According to her evidence, 
  she tossed and turned that night trying to piece things together and she finally 
  came up with Friday, July 7, because she "didn't think [she] would 
  have remembered it as well if it had been the week before that". Ms. Myers 
  provided the police with a statement on July 14, one week after the murder.</p>
<p>
  [43] Against that backdrop, I turn to the grounds of appeal.</p>
<p>
  GROUNDS OF APPEAL</p>
<p>
  Introduction</p>
<p>
  [44] The grounds of appeal raised by the appellant can be conveniently divided 
  into three categories: issues relating to the charge to the jury, the admissibility 
  of the appellant's July 18th statements to the police, and improprieties 
  in the Crown's closing address. I propose to deal with the jury charge 
  matters first because they are straightforward and can be disposed of summarily. 
  </p>
<p>
  I. ISSUES RELATING TO THE CHARGE</p>
<p>[45] The appellant submits that the trial judge committed three errors in his 
  charge to the jury. Before addressing them, I note that none drew the attention 
  of experienced defence counsel at trial [not Mr. Lockyer nor Mr. Cowan]. Moreover, 
  in assessing the alleged errors, I have considered them, as I must, in the context 
  of the charge as a whole. On that score, the appellant has no cause for complaint. 
  Viewed as a whole, the charge was clear, thorough and even-handed. Indeed, in 
  my view, it was a model of fairness. </p>
<p>
  (1) Instructions on circumstantial evidence</p>
<p>
  [46] The appellant submits that although the trial judge properly instructed 
  the jury that the prosecution could rely on circumstantial evidence to prove 
  its case, he failed to tell them that from the defence perspective, they could 
  look to the circumstantial evidence to raise a reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>
  [47] I would not give effect to that submission. Although there are isolated 
  passages in the charge that support it, when those passages are read in context 
  and against the charge as a whole, I am satisfied that the jury would have appreciated 
  that they could look to the circumstantial evidence as a basis for convicting 
  the appellant and for acquitting him.</p>
<p>
  (2) Instructions on motive</p>
<p>
  [48] The appellant submits that the trial judge misdirected the jury on the 
  issue of motive when he instructed them as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Give the evidence of motive such weight as you think it deserves, based on the 
  facts as you find them to be. Motive alone is insufficient to prove guilt beyond 
  a reasonable doubt. Rather, it is a factor which you may consider.</p>
<p>
  [49] The impugned instruction forms part of the trial judge's general 
  instructions on the issue of motive. The appellant's concern with the 
  passage in question stems from the fact that the Crown did not prove that the 
  appellant had a motive to kill Kamlesh. Accordingly, he submits that it was 
  wrong for the trial judge to tell the jury that motive was a factor which they 
  could consider in deciding whether the Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable 
  doubt. In doing so, he invited the jury to speculate. The appellant further 
  submits that the error was compounded by Crown counsel's invitation to 
  the jury in her closing address to speculate about possible motives the appellant 
  may have had for killing Kamlesh. </p>
<p>
  [50] I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. In his general instructions, 
  the trial judge made it clear to the jury that they could consider absence of 
  motive as a "circumstance &#8230; tending to support the presumption of 
  innocence" and that they should give it such weight as they deemed proper. 
  In the impugned passage, he reinforced to the jury that they were to give the 
  evidence of motive such weight as it deserved having regard to the facts as 
  found by them. Significantly, the trial judge did not tell the jury that there 
  was evidence from which they could find that the appellant had a motive to kill 
  Kamlesh. On the contrary, he specifically reminded the jury of the defence position 
  that the appellant loved Kamlesh and that there was "no motive whatsoever 
  for him having wanted to kill his wife".</p>
<p>
  [51] In my view, while it might have been preferable in the circumstances of 
  this case if the trial judge had refrained from instructing the jury in general 
  terms about the use they could make of a proved presence of motive, it is speculative 
  to think that the jury would have latched on to that instruction and used it 
  as an invitation to conjure up evidence of motive where none existed. Nor in 
  my view, did Crown counsel [not Ms. Roberts] extend such an invitation to the 
  jury in her closing address. She did nothing more than remind the jury that 
  in any relationship, appearances can be deceiving, and she highlighted certain 
  stresses and tensions existing within the Sodhi household at the time of the 
  murder. Her remarks were not improper. Accordingly, I would not give effect 
  to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (3) Instruction on after-the-fact conduct evidence</p>
<p>
  [52] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in leaving his attempted 
  suicide to the jury as after-the-fact conduct capable of supporting an inference 
  of guilt. In essence, it is his position that the instruction should not have 
  been given because the suicide attempt was as consistent with grief as it was 
  with guilt.</p>
<p>
  [53] With respect, I do not agree. Unlike the situation in R. v. Arcangioli 
  (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.), this is not a case in which the appellant 
  admitted to killing Kamlesh but denied a specific level of culpability in doing 
  so. Nor is it a case in which he denied committing some related offence arising 
  from the same operative set of facts. Here the appellant denied any involvement 
  in Kamlesh's death and his identity as the perpetrator was the only live 
  issue for the jury. In that sense, the facts are more closely aligned to those 
  in R. v. White (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.), where the two accused denied 
  committing the murder for which they were charged and sought to attribute their 
  flight and attempt to dispose of evidence to the commission of other offences. 
  In those circumstances, the Supreme Court held that the jury was entitled to 
  consider the evidence of flight and the attempt to dispose of evidence as circumstantial 
  evidence capable of linking the accused to the murder.</p>
<p>
  [54] In my view, the appellant's suicide attempt merits the same treatment. 
  Grief was certainly one possible explanation for it and the trial judge put 
  that explanation to the jury. Suicide, however, is a very extreme expression 
  of grief. It is not, in my view, the typical reaction that one would expect 
  from someone whose spouse has been murdered by a third party. Therein lies the 
  fallacy in the appellant's argument that his suicide attempt was as consistent 
  with grief as guilt and therefore incapable of supporting an inference of guilt. 
  On this record, it was open to the jury to view the suicide attempt as the final 
  act of a desperate man consumed with guilt for having killed his wife. The trial 
  judge did not err in so instructing the jury. This ground of appeal accordingly 
  fails.</p>
<p>
  II. THE APPELLANT'S JULY 18th STATEMENTS TO THE POLICE</p>
<p>
  [55] It will be recalled that the appellant was arrested at the Oakville Trafalgar 
  Hospital on July 10, three days after Kamlesh had been murdered and two days 
  after his attempted suicide. At the time of his arrest, the appellant handed 
  a letter to the investigating officers, Detectives Boychuk and Woudstra. The 
  letter was from his lawyer. It advised the police in clear language that the 
  appellant had retained counsel and that he wished to exercise his right to remain 
  silent. </p>
<p>
  [56] The contents of that letter did not deter the detectives from following 
  through with a plan they had devised to stimulate conversation with the appellant. 
  To that end, they presented the appellant with an up-to-date narrative of the 
  investigation and they asked him various questions. In doing so, they appealed 
  to his emotions and conscience. The appellant nonetheless remained steadfast 
  and he either refused to respond to their questions or told the officers to 
  speak to his lawyer.</p>
<p>
  [57] In his ruling on the voir dire the trial judge characterized the conduct 
  of the officers as "a constant and repetitive effort &#8230; to have Mr. 
  Sodhi talk about the case". He described their approach as one based on 
  a belief that they could "put pressure on [Mr. Sodhi] to speak through 
  an emotional appeal to negate the advice of his lawyer and to influence him 
  so that he would tell them what happened".</p>
<p>
  [58] I mention the July 10th interview only because it forms part of the backdrop 
  leading to the impugned July 18th statements. At trial, the Crown sought to 
  have the July 10th interview admitted into evidence as part of the narrative 
  leading up to the July 18th statements. The trial judge refused. In his view, 
  apart from the questionable conduct on the part of the police, the July 10th 
  conversation had "no probative value" and for that reason alone, 
  it was inadmissible. That brings me to the events of July 18.</p>
<p>
  [59] On July 18, pursuant to a prearranged plan, Detectives Boychuk and Woudstra 
  picked up the appellant from the detention centre where he was being held and 
  drove him to court for a scheduled remand. They then drove him to the police 
  station for photographs and fingerprints, following which they returned him 
  to the detention centre. Later that afternoon, the two detectives returned to 
  the detention centre and spoke to the appellant once again. Detective Boychuk 
  readily admitted that although he and his partner did not have a formal plan, 
  it was their intention to build a rapport with the appellant during the drive 
  in the hope that he might change his mind and make a statement. To that end, 
  Detective Boychuk sat beside the appellant in the back seat of the car as they 
  travelled to and from the various destinations and he did most of the talking. 
  </p>
<p> (a) Conversation 1: from the detention centre to the courthouse (9:25 a.m. 
  &#8211; 9:35 a.m.)</p>
<p>
  [60] On this leg of the trip, Detective Boychuk asked the appellant about his 
  treatment in the detention centre and the welfare of his children. He told the 
  appellant that he should be proud of his children. The appellant replied that 
  his children had told him that there was money missing from the house and that 
  the house had been left in a poor condition after the police had searched it. 
  The remainder of the conversation on the way to the courthouse essentially revolved 
  around those two matters.</p>
<p> (b) Conversation 2: from the courthouse to police headquarters (10:15 a.m. 
  &#8211; 10:30 a.m.)</p>
<p>
  [61] On the way to police headquarters, Detective Boychuk complimented the appellant 
  on the choice of his new lawyer, Edward Greenspan (Mr. Greenspan did not act 
  for the appellant at the trial). He told the appellant that Mr. Greenspan was 
  "one of the best" and that it was important that he tell Mr. Greenspan 
  the truth if he wanted proper representation. </p>
<p>
  [62] The appellant raised the question of Kamlesh's funeral. He wanted 
  to know who had prevented him from attending it. In the ensuing discussion, 
  among other things, the appellant reportedly said, "Irregardless of what 
  happened, [I] should have been able to see [my] wife". Detective Boychuk's 
  response included the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  At that point, I explained to Mr. Sodhi that there were things I could do for 
  him and things I couldn't. Like, when we had first met, I had told him 
  that we would do everything that we could to find the person responsible for 
  his wife's murder. Mr. Sodhi replied, "I respect you. I want you 
  to do a good job". I told Mr. Sodhi that I thought he knew we had done 
  a good job and that was why we were here, and that he was in the position he 
  was in. I told him that the investigation was nothing personal, but both Detective 
  Woudstra and I respected him. He was a man a lot like us, a hardworking family 
  man. There was no question he loved his wife and children.</p>
<p>
  [63] Detective Boychuk then told the appellant that he and his partner were 
  "good judges of character", to which the appellant replied, "there 
  is so much I want to answer but my lawyer says not to". Detective Boychuk 
  continued, telling the appellant that the only question they wanted answered 
  was "why?" The appellant replied "so do I", to which 
  Detective Boychuk responded, "there [is] only one person in the car who 
  [has] that answer". Detective Boychuk went on to explain that the police 
  had followed "all of the leads" and that "in this case, it 
  all [came] back to [the appellant] as being the person responsible". He 
  reminded the appellant of the physical evidence that had been recovered, all 
  of which pointed to him. The appellant responded, "I have answers to all 
  that but my lawyer told me not to say". Detective Boychuk replied that 
  "it was his decision whether he wanted to say anything or not". 
  </p>
<p>
  [64] Detective Boychuk continued, telling the appellant that the police did 
  not "consider him to be a stupid man and he shouldn't take [them] 
  to be stupid either". He then outlined some of the physical evidence and 
  asked the appellant to explain how he had managed to get yellow paint on his 
  Kara bracelet. The appellant hinted that it was work-related. The detective 
  then asked the appellant when he had last used paint of that nature, to which 
  the appellant did not respond. Detective Woudstra then interrupted, accusing 
  the appellant of "trying to treat [them] like [they] were [stupid]". 
  Again, the appellant replied, "he [had] answers for everything but [couldn't] 
  say".</p>
<p>
  [65] Detective Boychuk next broached the subject of the appellant's attempted 
  suicide and proceeded to provide his own lengthy interpretation of it as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> At this point, I outlined a scenario as to what I felt had 
  happened. I told Mr. Sodhi that as soon as he realized that we were going to 
  search his residence, that it was all over, because he knew what we'd 
  find there. So, in his mind, he started thinking about what he was going to 
  do, almost like he had a "trial" within himself. I told him that 
  I understood his religion, that it was like many, an eye for an eye and so forth, 
  and he interrupted me and said that he does not practice just one religion. 
  At that point, I interrupted him and said that all major religions have similar 
  themes and I continued by saying that this would explain why he was so quiet 
  both at this house and at Vijay's. That he was going through all this 
  in his mind and concluded that the only way he could rectify the terrible wrong 
  he had done was to take his own life. I said to him that the death of his wife 
  alone was not enough to explain his actions. It was more than grief. He had 
  his two children who were a part of him and a part of her, and that he was, 
  in effect, abandoning them. It had to be something terrible to make him do that, 
  and the only thing it could be was that he was responsible for her death and 
  that taking his life was the only way to make things rights.</p>
<p class="indent">I told him that I've spoken to friends of my own and all 
  had said that, under similar circumstances, they would not have acted the way 
  he had and left the children. Mr. Sodhi said, "You have no idea until 
  it happens to you. They're only saying that because it never happened 
  to them."</p>
<p>(c) Conversation 3: from police headquarters to the detention centre (11:00 
  a.m. &#8211; 11:20 a.m.)</p>
<p>
  [66] After leaving police headquarters, Detective Boychuk related the following 
  conversation between himself and the appellant: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#8230; Mr. Sodhi said, "I have two questions to ask. Where was my wife 
  found and how did she die?" I told Mr. Sodhi that I didn't think 
  I had to answer that because he knew the answers. He replied that, "if 
  you don't want to answer me, that's okay". I told him that 
  I have no problems answering the questions, just that I believed he knew the 
  answers already. </p>
<p>
  [67] Detective Boychuk told the appellant where his wife's body had been 
  found and the appellant indicated that he did not know the area. Several moments 
  later, Detective Boychuk told the appellant that Kamlesh had been strangled. 
  According to the detective, the appellant showed "no visible reaction 
  or sign of emotion" upon hearing that information. The appellant then 
  asked some questions about the keys to his van and a gift box that had been 
  placed in his van. Detective Boychuk said the police would look into the matter 
  of the box. After a brief period of silence, the appellant said, "questions 
  I have, I wish I could ask. I wish". The appellant then asked about his 
  car and a discussion ensued about to whom it should be returned. As they drove 
  into Milton, the appellant asked the name of the town. He was told that it was 
  Milton. When asked if he had ever been there before, he said, "only once 
  to fix a lighting fixture" at a relative's drug store. </p>
<p> (d) Conversation four: at the detention centre (2:58 p.m. &#8211; 3:30 p.m.)</p>
<p>
  [68] When the detectives returned to the detention centre in the afternoon, 
  they provided the appellant with an itemized list of jewellery they had seized 
  and they talked to him about the money allegedly missing from his home. At one 
  point, the appellant told them that his children were finding it hard to express 
  their feelings. Detective Boychuk said, "like you?". After hesitating 
  the appellant replied, "yes". The appellant then explained why his 
  children were so upset about the missing money and Detective Boychuk continued 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I explained that we take things like this very seriously and that we would investigate 
  fully if he requested it. I then talked to him about trust and how he had some 
  judgments about us and our sincerity and that our integrity was very important 
  to us. &#8230; He confirmed with us that we had treated him fairly.</p>

<p>
  Trial Judge's Ruling</p>
<p>
  [69] The defence sought to exclude the July 18th statements on the basis that 
  they had been obtained in a manner that violated the appellant's right 
  to counsel and his right to remain silent under ss. 10(b) and 7 of the Charter. 
  In particular, defence counsel maintained that in the circumstances, at a very 
  minimum, the police had a duty to reinstruct the appellant on his s. 10(b) rights 
  before attempting to speak to him on July 18. The essence of his argument is 
  captured in the following submission: </p>
<p class="indent">
  My argument is that where the police have contact with someone who is under 
  arrest who has previously indicated to them in clear and unambiguous terms he 
  wishes to exercise his right to silence, and at which point their intention 
  in advance is to elicit statements from him, they must at that point re-advise 
  him of his right to counsel in order that he can make an informed decision as 
  to whether or not to speak to them.</p>
<p>
  [70] The trial judge disagreed. In his view, there was nothing in the circumstances 
  that required the police to re-instruct the appellant on his s. 10(b) rights. 
  Those rights, he found, had been afforded to the appellant a week earlier and 
  nothing had changed in the meantime. Based on the evidence before him, the trial 
  judge was satisfied that on July 18, the appellant understood "the seriousness 
  of the charge against him" and he also understood "his rights to 
  counsel and his right to remain silent". Accordingly, the trial judge 
  concluded that the July 18th statements were admissible.</p>
<p>
  The Appellant's Position on Appeal</p>
<p>
  [71] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in concluding that his 
  s. 10(b) rights were not violated by the police conduct on July 18. He further 
  submits that the trial judge erred in not considering the issues from a broader 
  perspective than simply that of a possible violation of s. 10(b). In that regard, 
  he maintains that in the context of what occurred on July 18, s. 10(b) and s. 
  7 of the Charter, as well as the common law discretionary power of exclusion 
  regarding the admissibility of confessions, now enshrined in s. 11(d) of the 
  Charter, are all relevant to the assessment of the propriety of the July 18th 
  questioning.</p>
<p>
  [72] Concerning s. 10(b), the appellant invites us to formulate a rule that 
  would preclude the police from confronting an accused "whom they know 
  has retained counsel, regarding a crime for which he has already been charged 
  and for which the court process has commenced, except through counsel or as 
  a result of conversations initiated by the accused". In support of this 
  position, he relies primarily on the case of R. v. McCorkell, which is referred 
  to by M. H. Harris, "Notes and Comments: Concerning Statements to Police 
  Officers" (1962), 7 Crim.L.Q. 395 at 396-7 and various American authorities 
  including Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159 (1985).</p>
<p>
  [73] In the alternative, the appellant submits that in the face of his repeated 
  assertions of his right to silence, it was wrong for the police to engage in 
  conduct designed to weaken his resolve and lull him into giving up that right. 
  In conducting themselves as they did, he argues that the police violated his 
  right to silence under s. 7 of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  [74] In the further alternative, the appellant submits that the July 18th statements 
  should have been excluded under s. 11(d) of the Charter as their admission rendered 
  his trial unfair. He relies on a number of factors, including the purposive 
  conduct of the police designed to circumvent his asserted right to silence, 
  the nature and manner of their questioning, the lack of probative value in any 
  of the conversations and the prejudice resulting from, among other things, the 
  jury hearing "strongly worded police opinions of the appellant's 
  guilt".</p>
<p>
  [75] Finally, the appellant makes the overriding submission that at common law, 
  the July 18th statements should have been excluded because their prejudicial 
  effect exceeded their probative value.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [76] I agree with the appellant's final submission that the July 18th 
  statements should not have been admitted into evidence because their prejudicial 
  effect exceeded their probative value. In view of that conclusion, while I do 
  not wish to minimize the importance of the appellant's "Charter-based" 
  arguments, I find it unnecessary to deal with them. </p>
<p> [77] Regarding the probative value of the July 18th statements, I am of the 
  view that the first and fourth conversations had no probative value whatsoever. 
  Those are the conversations that occurred on the way to the courthouse from 
  the detention centre and at the detention centre in the afternoon. On that basis 
  alone, those conversations should have been excluded. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  [78] As for the second and third conversations, to the extent that either one 
  had any probative value, in my view, it was slight.</p>
<p>
  [79] In the second conversation on the way to police headquarters from the courthouse, 
  the only discussion of any possible relevance related to the appellant's 
  Kara bracelet and how it had come to have yellow paint on it. In the third conversation 
  on the way to the detention centre from police headquarters, the appellant's 
  request for information about how and where his wife died, and his professed 
  lack of familiarity with the town of Milton were the only possible matters of 
  relevance.</p>
<p>
  [80] To the extent that the second and third conversations may have contained 
  snippets of relevant information, the probative value of such information was 
  in my view negligible. Indeed, in the overall scheme of things, I believe that 
  if the jury had been deprived of that information, it would not have made the 
  slightest bit of difference to the case. </p>
<p>
  [81] As for the prejudicial effect of the statements, for reasons that will 
  be provided when I consider the application of the curative proviso, I believe 
  that it too was slight [see paras. 104-116, infra]. On balance, however, I am 
  satisfied that it overshadowed whatever limited probative value the statements 
  may have had.</p>
<p>
  [82] Accordingly, I am respectfully of the view that the July 18th statements 
  should not have been admitted into evidence. I would therefore give effect to 
  this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  III. CROWN IMPROPRIETIES</p>
<p>(1) Crown counsel's improper use of demeanour evidence</p>
<p>
  [83] The appellant takes issue with certain aspects of the Crown's closing 
  address. In particular, he submits that it was wrong for the Crown to invite 
  the jury to consider the appellant's demeanour at various stages of the 
  investigation and use it as after-the-fact evidence capable of supporting an 
  inference of guilt.</p>
<p>
  [84] In support of his position, the appellant listed eleven examples from the 
  closing address that he submits are offensive. I note that, once again, none 
  drew the attention or objection of defence counsel at trial.</p>
<p>
  [85] To resolve this ground of appeal, I find it unnecessary to list the eleven 
  examples. Many of them do not warrant criticism. Several for example relate 
  to the appellant's demeanour during his videotaped interview on July 8, 
  the morning after the murder. To the extent that the appellant was relying on 
  the content of that interview to further his defence of denial, the jury was 
  entitled to consider his demeanour in assessing the truthfulness of his answers 
  and the weight to be given to them. </p>
<p>
  [86] In other instances, Crown counsel merely referred the jury to evidence 
  that formed part of the narrative, the admissibility of which was not contested. 
  On those occasions, she did not invite the jury to draw impermissible inferences 
  of guilt from that evidence and those aspects of her address were accordingly 
  also proper. </p>
<p>
  [87] There were, however, several instances in which Crown counsel crossed the 
  line and invited the jury, at least implicitly, to infer guilt from equivocal 
  reactions and behaviour on the part of the appellant. For example, I think it 
  was improper to invite the jury to infer guilt from the appellant's failure 
  to ask certain questions of the police during the July 8th videotaped interview 
  and his failure to express outrage upon being asked if he had killed Kamlesh. 
  In a similar vein, it was improper to invite the jury to infer guilt from the 
  appellant's failure to show an appropriate level of concern about Kamlesh's 
  disappearance in his 11:00 p.m. telephone conversation with Vijay. </p>
<p>
  [88] There can be no getting around the fact that a few inappropriate comments 
  of this nature were made. I note, however, that they formed a small part of 
  a lengthy and otherwise proper closing address. In addition, as the respondent 
  points out, it is at least arguable that in making the impugned comments, Crown 
  counsel was merely responding to similar comments made by defence counsel in 
  his closing address. The following passage from the defence closing serves to 
  illustrate the point: </p>
<p class="indent"> Now my friend may invite you to draw some inferences from Mr. 
  Sodhi's demeanour on the videotape. I don't know what she's 
  going to suggest to you. I don't know if she's going to say he doesn't 
  look sufficiently upset, or that somehow he looks guilty. What I will say to 
  you is there is nothing in Sodhi's demeanor during that videotape interview 
  that should cause you any concern. But, more importantly, if you're going 
  to draw inferences from demeanour, resist the invitation to tunnel vision. Draw 
  your inferences from all of the demeanour evidence that you have before you.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember that Sodhi sounded genuinely concerned when he called 
  Vijay during the second phone call; that Mr. Sodhi seemed genuinely concerned 
  when the relatives arrived at 18 Waterloo Court. Remember, he wept in the presence 
  of Rajni and Jyoti at 50 Kennedy Road. Remember that, at 50 Kennedy Road, when 
  they hear the woman scream, they all start running around, calling out Kamlesh's 
  name and Mr. Sodhi did that, as well. Remember that he was described as numb 
  at Vijay's house.</p>
<p class="indent">And, of course, the real problem with drawing any inference 
  from somebody's demeanour is that we're all different. We all express 
  ourselves in different ways. Before you can draw an inference, you need an understanding 
  of how a person usually acts, how they usually express their emotions. And, 
  in this case, we have that base line. All of the relatives, all of Kamlesh's 
  relatives, agree that Mr. Sodhi is not an emotional man or a man who outwardly 
  displayed his emotions. He's not an emotionally demonstrative person. 
</p>
<p> [89] To be sure, this was not a one-way street. Both sides invited the jury 
  to consider equivocal demeanour evidence in support of their respective positions. 
  Counsel were involved in a hard-fought murder trial and they pressed their positions 
  with vigour. Just as perfection is not required in a jury charge<a href="#2">[2]</a>,<a name="r2"></a> 
  so too, in my view, it is not required in a closing address.</p>
<p>
  [90] What is significant about this case and what distinguishes it from R. v. 
  Baltrusaitis (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 539 (Ont. C.A.), upon which the appellant 
  relies, is the fact that the trial judge did not instruct the jury that they 
  could use the appellant's equivocal conduct or reactions as after-the-fact 
  conduct capable of supporting an inference of guilt. The only instruction given 
  by the trial judge on the after-the-fact conduct was the one given in relation 
  to the appellant's attempted suicide. As I concluded earlier, that instruction 
  was entirely proper.</p>
<p>
  [91] The jury was bound to follow the trial judge's instructions on the 
  use they could make of the evidence and particular aspects of it. While it would 
  have been preferable if the trial judge had instructed the jury that they could 
  not use the appellant's equivocal conduct in the manner urged by the Crown, 
  in my view, it is speculative to think that they would have latched on to the 
  few improper remarks made by Crown counsel and used them to draw impermissible 
  inferences of guilt against the appellant. Accordingly, I would reject this 
  ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [92] Before moving to the next issue, I would suggest that in future cases, 
  counsel would be well advised to seek direction from the trial judge before 
  addressing the jury on the use they can make of evidence of after-the-fact conduct 
  by an accused.</p>
<p>
  (2) Crown counsel's improper remarks about paint on the appellant's 
  blue jeans</p>
<p>
  [93] The police did not seize the appellant's blue jeans because on visual 
  inspection they saw no yellow paint specks on them. The officer who looked at 
  the jeans admitted that he did not inspect the inside pockets of the jeans. 
  He also stated that on his initial inspection of the safety glasses found inside 
  the jeans, he did not see any yellow paint specks on them. </p>
<p>
  [94] In her closing address, Crown counsel reminded the jury that the paint 
  on the glasses had been missed initially and she suggested that "it's 
  quite possible that there were sprays of yellow paint on the jeans that were 
  missed by the police as well".</p>
<p>
  [95] The appellant takes issue with that remark. He characterizes it as speculative 
  and improper and an attempt by the Crown "to take advantage of the police 
  failure to preserve evidence by suggesting that their failure had deprived the 
  Crown of incriminating evidence". He further submits that the trial judge 
  should have "commented severely" on the Crown's comment and 
  "told the jury that the absence of evidence, forensic or otherwise, to 
  contradict Sgt. Greenhill's evidence that there was no paint on the jeans 
  supported the defence position that there was no paint on the jeans". 
  </p>
<p>
  [96] I would not give effect to this ground of appeal for several reasons. Before 
  outlining them, I think it is important to set out the facts surrounding the 
  finding of the jeans.</p>
<p>
  [97] It will be recalled that the appellant was not entirely candid with the 
  police when he told them that the clothing he was wearing at the time of his 
  July 8th videotaped interview was the clothing that he was wearing on the evening 
  of July 7, 1995. The clothing that the police recovered from the appellant on 
  July 8 was the clothing that he had changed into before going to the police 
  station to report Kamlesh missing. As such, it is understandable that when the 
  police looked at the jeans hanging on the back of the closet in the appellant's 
  bedroom, they had no reason to believe that the jeans themselves would be of 
  much evidentiary value. That is so despite the finding of the safety glasses 
  in them. As indicated, the police did not notice yellow specks of paint on the 
  safety glasses at that time. It was much later when the glasses were looked 
  at microscopically that the yellow paint was discovered.</p>
<p> [98] Had the appellant been completely candid and told the police that he 
  was wearing the jeans at the time of Kamlesh's alleged disappearance, 
  there can be little doubt that the police would have seized and carefully inspected 
  them. Because of a pre-trial ruling,<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> however, 
  the jury was not made aware of the appellant's arguable duplicity regarding 
  the clothes he was wearing at the time of Kamlesh's disappearance. </p>
<p>
  [99] That is the backdrop against which I measure the appellant's submission.</p>
<p>
  [100] The impugned comment was by and large innocuous. As the respondent points 
  out, viewed in context, it was more in the nature of an aside. The Crown's 
  main point in the impugned passage was to highlight the finding of the safety 
  glasses in the jeans as a basis for rebutting the defence suggestion that the 
  killer had not worn these jeans because no yellow paint was observed on them. 
  In that sense, the Crown's submission was entirely fair and proper. </p>
<p>
  [101] Viewed against the case as a whole, the impugned remark is really quite 
  insignificant. Bearing that in mind, as well as defence counsel's failure 
  to object to it, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  CURATIVE PROVISO</p>
<p>
  [102] The appellant's statements to the police on July 18 should not have 
  been admitted into evidence. That is the one error of law that the appellant 
  has made out on this record.</p>
<p>
  [103] For reasons that follow, I am of the view that the error occasioned little 
  harm to the appellant and certainly none that would warrant a new trial. In 
  all likelihood, the slight prejudice that may have been occasioned by the admission 
  of the July 18th statements had no impact whatsoever on the verdict. But even 
  if the error was not harmless, I am satisfied that the verdict would necessarily 
  have been the same had it not occurred. The case against the appellant was overwhelming. 
  There is no realistic possibility that a new trial would produce a different 
  result.</p>
<p>
  [104] Commencing with the first branch of the proviso, harmless error, just 
  as the July 18th statements had very little probative value, so too, in my view, 
  their prejudicial effect was minimal. In the end, they did little more than 
  convey to the jury that the officers in charge did not consider themselves to 
  be stupid, that they believed that the appellant was guilty, that they believed 
  they had treated him fairly and that they had a theory as to why he had attempted 
  to commit suicide. </p>
<p>
  [105] In my view, none of this amounted to very much. It added little if anything 
  to what the jury would have already assumed or eventually been told by Crown 
  counsel in her closing address. Thus, while I accept that the jury should not 
  have been exposed to the opinions and theories of the investigating officers, 
  the resulting harm viewed realistically was likely minimal.</p>
<p>
  [106] As I understand it, however, the appellant's chief complaint lies 
  not so much with the prejudice occasioned by the police rhetoric, but with the 
  prejudice resulting from the references to his dealings and communications with 
  counsel. In particular, he points out that on two occasions, he told the police 
  that although he wanted to answer their questions, he could not do so on the 
  advice of counsel. He submits that because he failed to answer other questions 
  put to him by Detective Boychuk in like fashion, there was "a considerable 
  danger" that the jury would infer that this was "because he only 
  had self-incriminating answers to them". </p>
<p>
  [107] Alternatively, the appellant submits that in light of his response on 
  two occasions that he did have answers to the questions posed by police, the 
  jury was likely to wonder why it is that he had not taken the witness stand. 
  His concern in that regard was heightened by the fact that on three occasions 
  following his arrest in conversations with his wife's eldest sister, Asha, 
  he responded to questions posed by her in like fashion. In other words, he told 
  her that he had answers to her questions but on counsel's advice, he could 
  not respond. According to the appellant, in these circumstances, it was a virtual 
  certainty that the jury would speculate that his failure to testify indicated 
  that he really did not have answers and that he must therefore be guilty. </p>
<p>
  [108] On a more subtle level, the appellant also complains about the "less 
  obvious but real prejudice" flowing from Detective Boychuk's comments 
  about Mr. Greenspan and his admonition to the appellant that he should tell 
  Mr. Greenspan the truth if he wanted proper representation. The appellant contends 
  that because Mr. Greenspan did not act for him at trial, the jury was likely 
  to infer that this was because the appellant had lied to him.</p>
<p>
  [109] With respect, I believe that the concerns raised by the appellant are 
  overstated and largely speculative. </p>
<p>
  [110] Commencing with the alleged prejudice occasioned by the appellant's 
  stated inability to answer some of the questions posed by the detectives and 
  Asha due to the advice of counsel, the trial judge instructed the jury on no 
  less than three occasions (twice during the trial and once in his charge) that 
  the appellant was entitled to retain counsel and that his decision to follow 
  counsel's advice was irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence and 
  was to play no part in the jury's discussions or deliberations. One such 
  instruction came at the end of Asha's evidence. A portion of it is reproduced 
  below: </p>
<p class="indent"> You've heard evidence that Mr. Sodhi said that he had 
  been advised by his lawyer not to discuss the circumstances of his case with 
  anyone. You just heard that evidence from the last witness.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, this is standard advice that a defence counsel would give 
  to any client accused of a criminal offence. You must not draw any inferences 
  from the fact that Mr. Sodhi's lawyer gave him this advice or from the 
  fact that Mr. Sodhi indicated to others that he intended to follow that advice.</p>
<p class="indent">These facts are not relevant to the issue of guilt or innocence 
  and must not be considered by you during your discussions or deliberations in 
  reaching your verdict.</p>
<p>
  [111] In his charge, the trial judge said this: </p>
<p class="indent"> Also, I tell you as a matter of law, it is not -- I repeat 
  -- not relevant to your determination of guilt or innocence that, different 
  parts of those conversations with Asha or Detective Boychuk that Mr. Sodhi said 
  his lawyer had told him not to talk to anybody about the case and he, therefore, 
  was following his lawyer's advice. Those parts of the various conversations 
  to those persons by Mr. Sodhi, when he referred to what his lawyer told him 
  to do and what he was going to do in not speaking to Asha and to Detective Boychuk 
  in order to follow that advice, is not to be taken into account by you as part 
  of the evidence in this case as to guilt or innocence.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not relevant that his lawyer gave him that advice and 
  it is not relevant that Mr. Sodhi said he was going to follow it. [emphasis 
  in original.]</p>
<p>
  [112] Defence counsel was satisfied with those instructions. He asked for nothing 
  more. In light of those instructions, I think there is little risk that the 
  jury would have engaged in the impermissible reasoning envisaged by the appellant. 
  On the contrary, it is far more likely that they followed the trial judge's 
  instructions and removed from their consideration any and all references to 
  counsel's advice in the appellant's statements.</p>
<p> [113] In so concluding, I do not gainsay the possibility that the jury may 
  have wondered why they had not heard from the appellant. But if they did, as 
  was their right,<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a> I doubt that it had much 
  to do with the appellant's failure to make good on his stated ability 
  to "explain everything". Rather, in my view, it is much more likely 
  due to the fact that the case against the appellant was overwhelming and it 
  cried out for a response.</p>
<p>
  [114] As for Detective Boychuk's remarks about Mr. Greenspan, the concern 
  raised by the appellant is, in my view, highly speculative. I reject out of 
  hand the notion that in arriving at its verdict, the jury may have somehow been 
  influenced by the fact that Mr. Greenspan was not the appellant's trial 
  counsel.</p>
<p>
  [115] From this, it follows that although the concerns raised by the appellant 
  cannot be completely discounted, I believe that the prejudice flowing from the 
  improper admission of the July 18th statements was slight. The same holds true 
  for those portions of Asha's evidence about which the appellant takes 
  issue. Accordingly, even if the error was not totally harmless, I believe that 
  the verdict would necessarily have been the same had it not occurred.</p>
<p>
  [116] Before concluding this aspect of my analysis, I should point out that 
  on appeal, the appellant argues that the trial judge should have edited the 
  conversations with Asha and removed all references to counsel. He makes the 
  same submission with respect to the appellant's July 18th statements to 
  the police, assuming those statements were otherwise admissible. </p>
<p>
  [117] I do not doubt that editing was a viable option in this case. Indeed, 
  when it comes to references to counsel such as those in question, I believe 
  that as a general rule, the better practice would be to excise them rather than 
  to make them the subject of a limiting instruction. Had that approach been followed 
  here, it certainly would have eliminated the risks identified by the appellant. 
  </p>
<p>
  [118] Defence counsel at trial did not ask the trial judge to edit out the references 
  to counsel. Had he done so, the trial judge might well have acceded to his request. 
  As it is, the trial judge provided the jury with strong limiting instructions. 
  For reasons already stated, I believe that those instructions went a long way 
  towards removing the prejudice about which the appellant now complains for the 
  first time on appeal.</p>
<p>
  [119] Turning to the second branch of the proviso, the strength of the Crown's 
  case, even if I have understated the risk of prejudice flowing from the improper 
  admission of the July 18th statements, I would nonetheless apply the proviso. 
  In short, I am satisfied that the case against the appellant was so overwhelming 
  that the verdict would necessarily have been the same had the error not occurred.</p>
<p>
  Circumstantial evidence establishing that Kamlesh was killed at home by the 
  appellant</p>
<p> [120] Out of the mass of circumstantial evidence linking the appellant to 
  Kamlesh's disappearance and death, there are a number of discernible items 
  of evidence that belie the appellant's "I was framed" theory 
  and prove instead that he killed Kamlesh at home some time after 7:30 p.m. The 
  following non-exhaustive list consists of hard evidence. It does not include 
  questionable comments or inconsistent statements made by the appellant, nor 
  does it incorporate questionable after-the-fact conduct engaged in by him: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Kamlesh was found barefoot. All of the shoes that she would have worn to 
    go shopping were located at her home. She would not have been wearing the 
    black dress shoes found on the front passenger floor of the Concorde because 
    she never wore shoes of that nature when driving the car. Moreover, she would 
    not have worn such shoes when dressed in a jogging suit.</li>
  <li> The trunk of the car of the Concorde was completely empty. On the night 
    of July 6, it contained a blanket, chairs and a cooler. Those items were nowhere 
    in sight when the appellant's nephew, Sanjeev, left for work on the 
    afternoon of July 7 at 1:45 p.m. When he returned home from work at about 
    11:25 p.m., they were piled up by the front door. There was no explanation 
    as to how those items came to be in that location; nor was there any explanation 
    as to why the window washer fluid was also missing from the trunk. In other 
    words, there was no evidence to counter the Crown's theory that the 
    appellant used the trunk of the Concorde to remove Kamlesh's body from 
    the scene of the crime.</li>
  <li> The money found in the appellant's jeans matched the bills he received 
    from the bank on the afternoon of July 7. That called into question his statement 
    to the police that he had given Kamlesh $100.00 to go shopping. Contents of 
    Kamlesh's purse, located in the laundry room, contained $12.00. No groceries 
    were found in the Concorde. If she was robbed, the thief likely would have 
    taken the $12.00.</li>
  <li> The earrings and watch that Kamlesh was wearing on the night of July 7 
    were easily removable. They were found in the pants worn by the appellant 
    at the time of his attempted suicide. They did not have yellow paint on them. 
    In all likelihood, the appellant removed those items from Kamlesh at the house 
    before placing her body in the trunk of the car.</li>
  <li> The sleeve of the light shell jacket found in the laundry room contained 
    the same orange-pinkish substance that was seen leaking form Kamlesh's 
    nose and mouth. Although a similar substance was found on the Brook's 
    jacket located in the appellant's van, the placement of the staining 
    on that jacket (the right shoulder and lower right back) rendered it unlikely 
    that Kamlesh was wearing the Brook's jacket when she was killed. It 
    is far more likely that she was wearing the jacket found in the laundry room 
    which, unlike the Brooks jacket, was free of yellow paint.</li>
  <li> Kamlesh's purse was found over the gear shift of her car. It had 
    been placed there after the car had been vandalized and spray-painted. The 
    fact that she normally kept her purse in that location is something that would 
    only have been known by someone very familiar with her habits.</li>
  <li> The only piece of jewellery found on Kamlesh's body was her Kara, 
    an item that she and the appellant always wore. The appellant was well aware 
    of the religious significance of that item.</li>
  <li> Items removed from Kamlesh's purse such as the photograph of the 
    appellant on his honeymoon and the special note from her son would only have 
    been meaningful to the appellant and his family. The same can be said for 
    the bandanas that the appellant and his son used when entering a Sikh temple.</li>
  <li> Kamlesh's keys to the Concorde were found together with her jewellery 
    in the appellant's Ford van. The keys to the van had been removed from 
    that ring. A set of van keys was found in the pocket of the blue jeans the 
    appellant was wearing on the night of the murder. Another set of van keys 
    was recovered from the appellant after his suicide attempt. </li>
  <li>The appellant's safety glasses were found in the pocket of the blue 
    jeans he was wearing on the night of the murder. They had yellow paint on 
    them. Although the appellant attempted to explain the yellow paint spots as 
    having been deposited a month or so earlier when he was using yellow and blue 
    spray paint at work, his explanation failed to account for the fact that no 
    specks of blue paint were found on the glasses. As well, no explanation was 
    given as to why the glasses would have been in his jeans to begin with. </li>
  <li>The appellant's Kara had yellow paint on it. His explanation that 
    this too had occurred at work a month or so earlier rang hollow. The appellant 
    always wore his Kara and if it had been stained with yellow paint for several 
    weeks, he surely would have noticed it. According to expert testimony, the 
    paint from the Kara could easily have been removed. As well, no blue paint 
    specks were found on the Kara.</li>
  <li> A towel from the appellant's kitchen was found in the appellant's 
    van together with the cut-up jewellery. It was stiff with yellow paint. The 
    suggestion that the real killer surreptitiously broke into the appellant's 
    home and van and planted evidence in both locations is difficult enough to 
    accept. The further suggestion that while in the home, the killer went to 
    the kitchen, retrieved the towel, used it to wipe off and then deposited it 
    in the appellant's van borders on the ridiculous.</li>
  <li> On the appellant's version of the events, if the real killer did 
    plant evidence in his home and van, this could only have occurred after 11:30 
    p.m. on Friday night. Between 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., if the appellant 
    had been looking for Kamlesh as he claims, he would have been in his van. 
    Hence, the killer could not have planted the items found in the van during 
    that timeframe. After the appellant returned home at 11:00 p.m., someone was 
    always present at the home until 10:15 a.m. the next morning when the police 
    secured the premises. Specifically, after the appellant's nephew returned 
    home from work at around 11:25 p.m. on Friday night, he did not leave the 
    house. The chances of someone entering into the laundry room without him knowing 
    were slim. The chances of someone entering the kitchen and taking a towel 
    without him knowing were even more remote.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [121] As indicated, this substantial body of evidence proves to a virtual certainty 
  that the appellant killed Kamlesh at home some time after 7:30 p.m. on the night 
  of July 7. The evidence upon which the appellant relies to resist that finding 
  falls far short of the mark. His attempt to explain the yellow paint on the 
  safety glasses located in the pocket of his jeans rings hollow. It fails to 
  account for the lack of blue paint on the glasses and it also fails to explain 
  why the glasses were in his jeans to begin with. They were not required for 
  the work that he was doing on July 7 and there is no suggestion from anyone 
  that he was wearing the glasses that day.</p>
<p>
  [122] Similarly, the fact that he lacked an apparent motive to kill Kamlesh 
  is of no great consequence when one considers the overwhelming volume of circumstantial 
  evidence implicating him as the killer. My best sense of it is that he probably 
  killed Kamlesh in a moment of rage. That would explain why he commented to Vijay 
  at the police station "how one minute can change one's life". 
  It would also account for his attempted suicide and his inability to come to 
  grips with and acknowledge what he had done.</p>
<p>
  [123] That leaves Ms. Myers' evidence. Admittedly, her alleged sighting 
  of the Chrysler Concorde in Milton on July 7 at 8:30 p.m. is, on its face, problematic. 
  Nonetheless, when her evidence is stacked up against the evidence implicating 
  the appellant as the killer, it is apparent to me that she must have been mistaken. 
  That comes as no surprise, considering that she had no reason to think about 
  the appellant's car until July 12, five days after the murder. On her 
  own testimony, she tossed and turned that night trying to piece things together 
  and she finally came up with July 7 because "she didn't think [she] 
  would have remembered it as well if it had been the week before that".</p>
<p>
  [124] Putting all of this together, I am firmly of the view that on a new trial, 
  if the appellant's July 18th statements and portions of Asha's evidence 
  were excluded, there is no realistic possibility that the verdict would be different. 
  In so concluding, I have not ignored the fact that at one point in their deliberations, 
  the jury asked for "further direction on what constitutes &#8216;reasonable 
  doubt'". Not surprisingly, the appellant relies on that as a basis 
  for arguing that the curative provision cannot safely be applied. Manifestly, 
  I do not share the appellant's view. It is always a risky business to 
  attempt to divine what one or more jurors may have been thinking from a question 
  posed by the jury. That holds true in this case. </p>
<p>
  [125] The appellant would have it that "the jury may have been hesitating 
  &#8230; over where the reasonable doubt line should be drawn" in his case. 
  I cannot say with certainty that he is wrong. But in my view, bearing in mind 
  the appellant's "I was framed" theory, it is far more likely 
  that the question was asked because the jury wanted to be sure of the basis 
  upon which they could legitimately find a reasonable doubt. In particular, they 
  needed to know that a reasonable doubt was not a fanciful or imaginary doubt 
  but a real doubt based on reason and common sense. In the end, it is clear that 
  the jury rejected the appellant's "I was framed" theory as 
  fanciful. In my view, that conclusion is unassailable. </p>
<p>
  [126] For these reasons, I am satisfied that this is a proper case to apply 
  the curative proviso. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction.</p>
<p>
  SENTENCE APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [127] The trial judge increased the appellant's period of parole ineligibility 
  from ten to fourteen years. The appellant accepts that that sentence was within 
  the range of sentences (twelve to fifteen years) approved by this court in R. 
  v. McKnight (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 41. He maintains, however, that the trial 
  judge fell into error when he described the scene as "terrible" 
  and "one of the worst fact situations". He also submits that the 
  trial judge was wrong to find that there were "no mitigating factors" 
  in the case. Absent those errors, the appellant submits that the trial judge 
  would have set the period of parole ineligibility at twelve years. He asks that 
  we reduce it accordingly.</p>
<p>
  [128] The trial judge gave detailed and cogent reasons for sentence. He thoroughly 
  reviewed the appellant's background and history and was well aware of 
  the fact that the offence was out of character for the appellant. It is in that 
  context that the trial judge's remark about the lack of mitigating factors 
  must be viewed. Clearly, he was aware of the mitigating factors relating to 
  the offender. </p>
<p>
  [129] The trial judge's perception of the scene as "one of the worst 
  fact situations" also must be viewed in context. The trial judge quite 
  properly rejected the defence submission that this was not a brutal killing. 
  In his opinion: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Ms. Sodhi was brutally assaulted. She was throttled at close range by the accused 
  who had a ligature nearby and used it to make sure of her death. </p>
<p>
  [130] I see no basis for interfering with that finding. That said, it is at 
  least arguable that the trial judge overstated the case when he described the 
  scene as one of the worst fact situations. In my view, however, what separates 
  this case from others and takes it out of the twelve-year range is the appellant's 
  conduct after the event.</p>
<p>
  [131] The appellant's attempt to cover-up his crime and his persistent 
  efforts to create suspicion that someone else had committed it were despicable 
  and cowardly. This conduct amounted to a serious aggravating feature and, in 
  and of itself, warranted a significant increase in the period of parole ineligibility. 
  Combining that with the domestic nature of the crime and the brutality associated 
  with it, I cannot say that the trial judge erred in imposing the sentence he 
  did.</p>
<p>
  [132] Accordingly, although I would grant leave to appeal sentence, I would 
  dismiss the appeal from sentence.</p>
