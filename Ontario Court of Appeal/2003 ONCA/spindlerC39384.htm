<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Kenneth Pedlar dated December 17, 2002.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellants are serving life sentences for murder and are incarcerated 
  in Millhaven Institution, a maximum security penitentiary. They applied for 
  habeas corpus claiming that their detention in a maximum security penitentiary 
  was illegal and seeking an order directing that they be moved to &quot;a penitentiary 
  of a lower security level&quot;. The motion judge held that he had jurisdiction 
  to consider the habeas corpus claim but declined to do so holding that the Federal 
  Court (Trial Division) was the more appropriate forum.</p>
<p>
  [2] I agree with the motion judge's disposition and would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  [3] Section 30 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act S.C. 1992 c. 20 
  (CCRA) requires that all federal prisoners be classified upon their confinement 
  according to their security risk as maximum, medium or minimum. The classification 
  must be made in a manner that is consistent with the principles in the CCRA 
  and in particular, with s. 28. That section reads: </p>
<p class="indent"> Where a person is, or is to be confined in a penitentiary, 
  the Service shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the penitentiary 
  in which the person is confined is one that provides the least restrictive environment 
  for that person, taking into account</p>
<p class="indent10">(a) the degree and kind of custody and control necessary for</p>
<p class="indent15">(i) the safety of the public,</p>
<p class="indent15">(ii) the safety of that person and other persons in the penitentiary, 
  and</p>
<p class="indent15">(iii) the security of the penitentiary;</p>
<p>
  [4] Sections 17 and 18 of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act Regulations 
  SOR/92-620 identify the relevant factors to be considered in making a classification 
  and the criteria to be applied in determining an inmate's security classification.</p>
<p>
  [5] The classification process has multiple components including an assessment 
  made under what is called the Custody Ratings Scale (CRS). The CRS is a research-based 
  instrument, which generates numerical scores intended to measure both the inmate's 
  potential for institutional adjustment and his security risk. The CRS is designed 
  to make the classification of inmates more objective and transparent. Under 
  the security risk component of the CRS, scores are assigned to various factors 
  such as the number of prior convictions, prior parole experiences and the length 
  of the sentence being served. Higher scores indicate a greater security risk. 
  If the score is above a preset number, the prisoner will be placed in maximum 
  security. If the score is below that number but above a second preset number, 
  the prisoner will be placed in medium security. If the score is below the second 
  preset number, the prisoner will be placed in minimum security. Although the 
  CRS classification usually determines a prisoner's placement, a designated official 
  within the prison has the discretion to override the classification determination 
  made using the CRS. This is referred to as a discretionary override.</p>
<p>
  [6] Prior to February 23, 2001, prisoners serving life sentences for murder 
  had their security placement determined in the same way as other prisoners. 
  Under the CRS persons serving life sentences for murder could achieve scores 
  that were sufficiently low to warrant placement in medium or minimum security 
  institutions. Prisoners serving life sentences for murder could also request 
  that the designated person within the institution exercise her discretion and 
  override the placement indicated by the CRS score in favour of a less severe 
  placement. In addition, as with all other prisoners, persons convicted of murder 
  had their placements reviewed annually and could challenge their placements 
  through an internal grievance procedure. Under the policy in place prior to 
  February 23, 2001, about 70% of the persons convicted of murder were placed 
  in a medium or minimum security institution on their initial placement.</p>
<p>
  [7] On February 23, 2001, the Commissioner of Corrections (the Commissioner) 
  issued a policy applicable to all persons convicted of murder and assessed for 
  initial placement after February 23, 2001. I will refer to this as the new policy. 
  Under the new policy, murderers brought into the Federal prison system after 
  the policy was in effect, were classified as maximum security. This change was 
  effected by increasing the numerical value assigned to the length of sentence 
  in the CRS assessment so that it was higher than the number required for placement 
  in the maximum security. Consequently, every person convicted of murder achieved 
  a CRS score that was greater than the score required for classification in maximum 
  security. The new policy also provided that the initial assessment for murderers 
  would be reviewed after two years instead of annually.</p>
<p>
  [8] Under the new policy, prisoners convicted of murder could apply for the 
  discretionary override described above, however it could be granted only by 
  the Assistant Commissioner of Corrections. One override has been granted since 
  the policy came into effect two and a half years ago.</p>
<p>
  [9] In addition to the possibility of a discretionary override, prisoners convicted 
  of murder and classified under the new policy can also challenge their classification 
  by way of the established internal grievance procedures. The grievance procedures 
  are of little practical value given that the initial classification is made 
  pursuant to a specific policy put in place by the Commissioner.</p>
<p>
  [10] The material filed by the appellants indicates that prior to the implementation 
  of the new policy, their CRS scores would have placed them in a medium or minimum 
  institution. The appellants have unsuccessfully challenged their placements 
  through the internal grievance procedures. The appellant Samuels unsuccessfully 
  sought an exercise of the override discretion by the Assistant Commissioner 
  of Corrections.</p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  [11] The appellants contend that the new policy is in direct conflict with s. 
  28 of the CCRA and ss. 17 and 18 of the Regulations in that it is based on policy 
  considerations which are inconsistent with those identified in s. 28. The appellants 
  also argue that the new policy effectively deprives the appellants of the individualised 
  classification assessment to which they are entitled under the Act. They are 
  now classified as a group based exclusively on the offence they committed.</p>
<p>
  [12] The appellants further contend that as the new policy is contrary to the 
  CCRA it is beyond the powers of the Commissioner, and is therefore illegal. 
  They argue that their continued confinement in a maximum security penitentiary 
  pursuant to an illegal policy amounts to an unlawful deprivation of their liberty 
  which is properly curable on a habeas corpus application. Finally, the appellants 
  argue that their illegal confinement infringes their rights under s. 7 and s. 
  9 of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  [13] In declining to exercise his habeas corpus application jurisdiction, the 
  motion judge accepted the respondent's submission that the application was in 
  essence, a challenge to the legal validity of a policy fashioned by the Commissioner 
  in the purported exercise of powers granted to the Commissioner by a federal 
  statute. The motion judge held that challenges to the exercise of that power 
  should be heard in the Federal Court.</p>
<p>
  [14] On appeal, this court heard argument as to the appropriate forum in which 
  to bring this application and the merits of the application.</p>
<p>
  IV</p>
<p>
  [15] Counsel for the respondent submitted that the Superior Court had no jurisdiction 
  to grant habeas corpus. I disagree. The material filed by the appellants leaves 
  no doubt that prisoners held in maximum security are subject to significant 
  liberty restrictions that do not exist for prisoners in a medium or minimum 
  security institution. A claim that a prisoner is being unlawfully detained in 
  a part of the prison where his liberty is subject to significant restrictions 
  that would not exist if the prisoner was held in the part of the prison in which 
  he claims he should be held, may be advanced by way of a habeas corpus application. 
  The fact that the detention may also be challenged by way of an application 
  for judicial review in the Federal Court challenging the placement decision 
  does not oust the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the Provincial Superior Court: 
  R. v. Miller (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 105-106, 115-118 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [16] The importance of habeas corpus as an effective and expeditious remedy 
  to those unlawfully deprived of their liberty cannot be gainsaid. It is, however, 
  clear that there are circumstances in which a provincial superior court should 
  decline to exercise its habeas corpus jurisdiction leaving the applicant to 
  seek relief by way of judicial review in the Federal Court. In Steele v. Warden 
  of Mountain Institution, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1385, the applicant sought habeas corpus 
  claiming that his continued detention amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. 
  The Supreme Court of Canada agreed holding that he had been unlawfully detained 
  for many years as a result of the National Parole Board's repeated failure to 
  properly exercise its statutory powers over Mr. Steele. </p>
<p>
  [17] After considering the merits of the claim, Cory J. turned to the propriety 
  of relief by way of habeas corpus. He said at p. 418: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is necessary to make a further comment. As I have made clear above, the continuing 
  detention of a dangerous offender sentenced pursuant to the constitutionally 
  valid provisions of the Criminal Code will only violate s. 12 of the Charter 
  when the National Parole Board errs in the exercise of the vital duties of tailoring 
  the indeterminate sentence to the circumstances of the offender. This tailoring 
  is performed by applying the criteria set out in s. 16(1) of the Parole Act. 
  Since any error that may have been committed occurs in the parole review process 
  itself, an application challenging the decision should be made by means of a 
  judicial review from the National Parole Board decision, not by means of an 
  application for habeas corpus. It would be wrong to sanction the establishment 
  of a costly and unwieldy parallel system for challenging a Parole Board decision. 
  As well, it is important that the release of a long-term inmate should be supervised 
  by those who are experts in this field. &#133; [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [18] Cory J. went on to hold that in the exceptional circumstances of the case 
  it would be unfair to require the applicant to begin a new proceeding in the 
  Federal Court. Cory J. affirmed the applicant's release on habeas corpus. </p>
<p>
  [19] As I read Steele, supra, except in exceptional circumstances, a provincial 
  superior court should decline to exercise its habeas corpus jurisdiction where 
  the application is in essence, a challenge to the exercise of a statutory power 
  granted under a federal statute to a federally appointed individual or tribunal. 
  Those challenges are specifically assigned to the Federal Court under the Federal 
  Court Act R.S.C. 1985 c. F-7 s. 18, s. 28. By directing such challenges to the 
  Federal Court, Parliament has recognized that individuals or tribunals exercising 
  statutory powers under federal authority must exercise those powers across the 
  country. It is important that judicial interpretations as to the nature and 
  scope of those powers be as uniform and consistent as possible. By giving the 
  Federal Court jurisdiction over these challenges, Parliament has provided the 
  means by which uniformity and consistency can be achieved while at the same 
  time, facilitating the development of an expertise over these matters in the 
  Federal Court.</p>
<p>
  [20] Mr. Manson, for the appellants submits that Steele applies only to situations 
  where a prisoner's unlawful detention can be ascribed to some improper conduct 
  by the parole authorities. While it is true that most of the cases that have 
  applied Steele involve alleged errors by the Parole Board, I see no logical 
  reason why Steele should not have equal application to decisions made by other 
  federal prison authorities that negatively impact on liberty and are also subject 
  to judicial review in the Federal Court. The need for consistency in interpretation 
  as well as the need to avoid costly and cumbersome parallel systems of review 
  are as important in the determination of the classification of prisoners as 
  they are in questions of parole.</p>
<p>
  [21] Steele was applied in R. v. Hickey, [2003] B.C.J. No. 61 (C.A.), a case 
  involving a challenge to a placement decision made by prison authorities. In 
  Hickey, the applicant was serving a life-sentence in a British Columbia penitentiary. 
  He challenged the decision of the correctional authority to transfer him to 
  a Special Handling Unit in a Quebec penitentiary.</p>
<p>
  [22] Ryan J.A. for a unanimous court first held that the decision to transfer 
  the applicant sufficiently engaged his liberty interest to give the Supreme 
  Court of British Columbia jurisdiction to hear the habeas corpus application. 
  She went on however to hold that the Superior Court should have declined to 
  exercise that jurisdiction stating at para. 50: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is trite that the court has a discretion to refuse to entertain an application 
  for habeas corpus if there exists a viable alternative to the writ. In the context 
  of prison law, the fact that there is in place a complete comprehensive and 
  expert procedure for review of a decision affecting the prisoner's confinement 
  is a factor which militates against hearing a petition for habeas corpus. But 
  there will be exceptions.</p>
<p>
  [23] Ryan J. concluded that as the applicant had not offered an explanation 
  for the failure to pursue judicial review in the Federal Court, the British 
  Columbia Supreme Court should have declined to hear the habeas corpus application.</p>
<p>
  [24] I agree with the analysis in Hickey. It is agreed by all counsel that the 
  appellants can challenge the Commissioner's new policy in the Federal Court. 
  They should do so unless they can establish exceptional circumstances justifying 
  the exercise of the Ontario Superior Court's habeas corpus jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  [25] Counsel for the appellants argued that there are exceptional circumstances 
  in this case. They advanced three arguments. First, they contend that on a judicial 
  review application, the appellants would have the onus of demonstrating the 
  illegality of the new policy whereas on a habeas corpus application, the respondent 
  would have that onus. I am not sure that the appellants' submission is correct 
  in law. In any event, onus will play no part in a determination of the merits 
  of this application. Either the policy is beyond the Commissioner's authority 
  and therefore made without jurisdiction or it is not. I cannot imagine how the 
  resolution of this issue could possibly turn on which party has the onus of 
  proof.</p>
<p>
  [26] Second, the appellants argue that on a judicial review application, the 
  court would have a discretion to dismiss the application even if the appellants 
  could demonstrate the illegality of the new policy. The appellants submit that 
  on a habeas corpus application, they are entitled as a right to a remedy once 
  they demonstrate the illegality of the policy. I agree that relief by way of 
  judicial review is discretionary, whereas relief on habeas corpus is as of right 
  once an illegal detention is established. However, I do not think it is realistic 
  to suggest that a court on judicial review would decline to grant relief if 
  it accepted the appellants' contention that the Commissioner had no power to 
  implement the new policy. The remedial provisions in s. 18.1(3) of the Federal 
  Court Act are certainly broad enough to allow the court on an application for 
  judicial review to grant virtually the identical remedy sought by the appellants 
  on their habeas corpus application. The fact that judicial review may provide 
  a more flexible remedy than habeas corpus is not, in any event, a factor which 
  should favour resort to habeas corpus over an application for judicial review.</p>
<p>
  [27] Lastly, the appellants submit that they were able to get before the Superior 
  Court on a habeas corpus application much more quickly than they could have 
  gotten before the Federal Court on a judicial review application. Delay in gaining 
  access to judicial review can justify the exercise of habeas corpus jurisdiction. 
  While there is some evidence in the record indicating that there is often considerable 
  delay in bringing a judicial review application in the Federal Court, there 
  was no attempt to seek judicial review in this case. The material indicates 
  that the Associate Chief Justice of the Federal Court can order an expedited 
  hearing. Absent any request for an expedited hearing, I cannot assume that one 
  would not have been provided. The appellants have not demonstrated that proceeding 
  by way of judicial review would have taken appreciably longer than did this 
  habeas corpus application.</p>
<p>
  V</p>
<p>
  [28] In summary, the application brought by the appellants challenged their 
  detention based on the legality of the new policy implemented by the Commissioner. 
  The appellants did not challenge the constitutionality of any part of the CCRA 
  or its Regulations. The new policy applies across the country to all persons 
  convicted of murder and classified after the date the policy came into effect. 
  In essence, the appellants contend that the Commissioner acted without jurisdiction. 
  The appellants' challenge is amenable to determination by way of judicial review. 
  Indeed, it is exactly the kind of challenge that Parliament has directed should 
  go to the Federal Court (Trial Division) where a statutory power is granted 
  by federal legislation and exercised by a federally appointed person. Federal 
  Court Act s. 18.1(4)(a). I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
