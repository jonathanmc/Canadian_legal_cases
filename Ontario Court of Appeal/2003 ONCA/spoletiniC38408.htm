<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: June 11, 2003</p>
<p>[1] This appeal is essentially fact driven. There were two versions of what 
  the appellant was alleged to have said. The trial judge preferred the evidence 
  given by Ms. DiNovo as to what the appellant said and gave two reasons for doing 
  so. The first was that Ms. DiNovo had recorded the essential components of what 
  was said accurately at the time the comments were made and the second was that 
  in a conversation with the city solicitor and city manager the appellant told 
  them he had &quot;information respecting a domestic court matter &quot; involving 
  the respondent sometime in the past. Having regard to the high standard of deference 
  owing to a trial judge's findings of fact we cannot interfere: Housen v. Nikolaisen 
  (2002) SCC 33.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] We see no basis for setting aside the legal conclusion flowing from that 
  finding of fact, namely, that the words spoken left the clear inference that 
  the respondent was someone who had been guilty of corrupt and criminal behaviour.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The amount of damages is not in issue.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent fixed in the amount 
  of $3000 all inclusive. </p>
