<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The plaintiff appeals from the order of Jarvis J. dated October 28, 2002 
  in which he dismissed her action for delay. In our view, the motions judge erred 
  in principle when finding that the delay was inordinate and inexcusable.</p>
<p>
  [2] In relation to whether the delay was inordinate, we note that after the 
  limitation period expired in October 1997, the plaintiff made efforts to move 
  the matter along. Those efforts included repeated attempts to schedule examinations 
  for discovery. The failure to schedule the discoveries was at least partly due 
  to the defendants.</p>
<p>
  [3] Was the delay inexcusable? The plaintiff changed solicitors a number of 
  times. She was engaged in two other lawsuits against the same defendants who 
  were represented by the same counsel. She did take fresh steps between 1997 
  and 2002. While the plaintiff's attention was focussed on the other two lawsuits, 
  there is no evidence to show that she consciously decided not to pursue this 
  action. As this court stated in Halton Community Credit Union Ltd. v. ICL Computers 
  Ltd. (1985), 1 C.P.C. (2d) 24 at 27: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; it is a principle of very long standing that the client is not to be 
  placed irrevocably in jeopardy by reason of the neglect or inattention of his 
  solicitor &#133;</p>
<p>
  [4] In any event, if the presumption of prejudice arose, it has been rebutted 
  for the following reasons: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The witness who died did so within the limitation period;</p>
<p class="indent">2. The evidence suggesting that witnesses' memories have faded 
  is extremely tenuous and it does not appear that the witnesses in question are 
  material; and</p>
<p class="indent">3. Given the nature of the incidents involved and the fact that 
  witness statements were taken in 1992 and again in 2002, it appears that memories 
  can be refreshed.</p>
<p>
  [5] For these reasons, the appeal is allowed, the order of Jarvis J. is set 
  aside and, in its place, an order shall go dismissing the defendants' motion 
  to dismiss for delay.</p>
<p>
  [6] Costs of the appeal are to the appellant fixed in the amount of $10,000. 
  Each side shall bear its own costs of the motion.</p>
