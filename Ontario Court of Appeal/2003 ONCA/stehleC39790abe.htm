<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant pleaded guilty to cultivation of marihuana. There was a joint 
  submission for 90 days imprisonment to be followed by a period of probation. 
  The Crown described the cultivation operation as being in its infancy and as 
  quite minor and unsophisticated.</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge rejected the joint submission and sentenced the appellant 
  to 8 months imprisonment. In doing so, he overemphasized the seriousness of 
  the drug involved. On appeal, Crown counsel fairly conceded that the joint submission 
  was within the appropriate range for the offence and the offender.</p>
<p>[3] In these circumstances, we are of the view, that although the joint submission 
  was on the lenient side, the trial judge erred in concluding that acceptance 
  of that submission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</p>
<p>[4] Leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and the sentence is reduced 
  to one of 90 days imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 12 months, 
  the conditions of which are set out in a draft submitted by counsel. In all 
  other respects, the sentence below is confirmed.</p>
