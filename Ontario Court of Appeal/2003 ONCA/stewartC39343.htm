<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice L. Theodore G. Collins of the 
  Ontario Court of Justice dated November 18, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of uttering a threat to cause 
  bodily harm to Bonnie Stafford, his common-law partner. He told Ms. Stafford 
  during the course of an argument that he would smash her face with a drawer. 
  He was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment plus two years' probation. He seeks 
  leave to appeal against sentence and, if leave be granted, appeals his sentence.</p>
<p>
  [2] The transcript of the proceedings reveals that before the appellant pleaded 
  guilty to the charge, a female voice was heard to say in open court: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I made a statement against Al only because I wanted a peace bond. I never wanted 
  him arrested. He was never a threat to us and we were never afraid of him. All 
  I wanted was for him to leave our home.</p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge told her to be silent or he would have to put her out of 
  the courtroom. The Crown then read into the record the circumstances that formed 
  the basis of the charge. The complainant complained, on November 13, 2002, about 
  an argument that had taken place that day with the appellant. However, the threat 
  which is the subject-matter of this charge was made two weeks earlier, on October 
  29, 2002.</p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge found the appellant guilty as charged and immediately proceeded 
  to hear submissions on sentence from the Crown. As part of the submissions, 
  the Crown indicated that the appellant and the complainant had been in a common-law 
  relationship that was in the process of breaking up. He told the trial judge 
  that the complainant was in court and that he was not sure what she would say 
  about the events. The trial judge replied that he would not hear from her.</p>
<p>
  [5] On the record before us, it is unclear whether the person in attendance 
  in the courtroom was the appellant's common-law spouse or her sister, who had 
  given a statement to the police. In either event, the person in attendance had 
  information which she sought to provide to the court and which the Crown appeared 
  to think would, and should, have been heard.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant acknowledged the particulars of his criminal record. The trial 
  judge concluded on the basis of the record that the appellant was a dangerous 
  person and, without further reasons, sentenced the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [7] As he was dealing with an unrepresented accused person, fairness required 
  the trial judge to hear what the complainant - or her sister - had to say on 
  the accused's behalf or, at a minimum, he should have informed the accused that 
  he had the right to call her evidence himself. The Crown seemed to think that 
  she had something to say. The delay would have been minimal and providing the 
  witness with the opportunity to speak would have ensured trial fairness. </p>
<p>
  [8] Offences related to spousal abuse are always a serious matter. However, 
  there are different degrees of gravity in incidents of abuse and domestic violence. 
  The statement, made in open court by the witness in attendance, was very telling. 
  Had the trial judge listened to what was being said, and to the information 
  that the witness sought to provide, it may have assisted him in assessing the 
  seriousness of the offence in order to arrive at an appropriate penalty.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant had a substantial criminal record and it certainly was an 
  aggravating factor that needed to be considered in imposing sentence. Without 
  knowing what the trial judge thought of this offence, as he gave no reasons, 
  he appears to have sentenced the appellant on his record, without consideration 
  for the particulars of the offence. It must be remembered that the appellant 
  had already paid the price for his earlier convictions.</p>
<p>
  [10] In our view, a sentence of 18 months' imprisonment is out of proportion 
  with the gravity of the offence. It is unreasonable. The appellant has served 
  in excess of five and one-half months of his sentence. We would grant leave 
  to appeal, allow the appeal and reduce the sentence to time served. The probation 
  order will remain in place. </p>
