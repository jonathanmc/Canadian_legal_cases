<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree that the trial judge erred in law by departing from the joint 
  submission. The joint submission was for three years, minus credit for pretrial 
  custody, at the rate of either two for one, or one for one. The pretrial custody 
  was three and a half months. The trial judge concluded that no credit should 
  be given because of the appellant&#8217;s criminal record.</p>
<p> [2] In our view, given the relatively small difference in sentence between 
  three years and three years minus three and a half or seven months, we see no 
  basis to conclude that the sentence proposed in the joint submission was contrary 
  to the public interest or would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
</p>
<p>[3] We would therefore grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal, set 
  aside the sentence and impose a sentence of three years minus credit for time 
  served, in this case on the basis of one for one, which is 106 days.</p>
