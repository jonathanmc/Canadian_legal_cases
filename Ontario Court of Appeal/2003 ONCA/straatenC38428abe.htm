<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] This case is largely fact-driven. The finding of fact by the trial judge 
  that he accepted Mr. Wasman's evidence is fatal to the claim as it applies to 
  the area south of Tree Line One. It was open to the trial judge to accept that 
  evidence. We do not view the minutes of the Land Division Committee as undermining 
  that finding in view of Mr. Krueger's later conduct. As to the area to the west, 
  the appellant has now abandoned the claims as it relates to the property between 
  Tree Lines two and three. </p>
<p>
  [2] Thus, what remains in dispute is a buffer zone of about four to six feet. 
  Without necessarily accepting all of the trial judge's reasons, especially his 
  view about the effect of the seasonal nature of the occupation, we are satisfied 
  that it was open to the trial judge to find that the use was not intended to 
  and did not exclude Mr. Krueger's proprietary use of the land, including the 
  buffer zone. That finding is sufficient to dispose of the claim to the west.</p>
<p> [3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $9,900 for the 
  Nicholsons and $5,000 for the estate both on a partial indemnity basis.</p>
