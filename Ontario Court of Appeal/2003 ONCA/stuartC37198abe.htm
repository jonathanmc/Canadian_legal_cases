<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>CATZMAN AND GILLESE JJ.A.:</p>
<p> [1] The majority of the court does not read the reasons of the sentencing 
  judge as feeling himself precluded from imposing a conditional sentence in this 
  case. In the absence of error in principle or any of the other factors that 
  warrant appellate intervention, this court is obliged to defer to the sentencing 
  judge's disposition of sentence. Accordingly, we grant leave to appeal 
  sentence, but would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>ABELLA J.A. (dissenting):</p>
<p> [2] I agree with the appellant's submission that the trial judge's 
  brief reasons reflect an error in principle, namely, his implicit assumption 
  that a conditional sentence was not available for this kind of offence. This 
  is contrary to at least 3 decisions of this court. </p>
<p> [3] Based on the particular circumstances of the appellant, and especially 
  the positive pre-sentence report, I would have imposed a conditional sentence.
