<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The respondent is charged with first degree murder. He was ordered released 
  on bail on strict conditions which included a 6:00 p.m. curfew. His mother and 
  stepfather were named as his sureties. </p>
<p>[2] The Crown successfully sought an order from Chief Justice McMurtry directing
   the review of the release order under s. 680 of the Criminal Code. We would
   confirm the order releasing the respondent on bail pending trial.</p>
<p>[3] The respondent is 17 years old. He lives with his mother and stepfather. 
  Apart from one minor prior conviction, he has had no involvement with the criminal 
  justice system. It was not contested at the bail hearing that he was the person 
  who killed the deceased, a friend of his uncle, by striking him with a baseball 
  bat in full view of at least one witness. </p>
<p>[4] There was no evidence offered at the bail hearing to support a conviction 
  on the charge of first degree murder. Certainly, on the evidence offered at 
  the bail hearing, a conviction for second degree murder or manslaughter is a 
  strong possibility. There is, however, some potential evidence of self-defence.</p>
<p>[5] Pardu J. concluded that the respondent's detention was not justified on 
  the primary or secondary grounds (s. 515(10)(a)(b)). In addressing the tertiary 
  grounds (s. 515(10)(c)), she took into consideration the fact that if the respondent 
  was denied bail, because there is no youth facility in Sault Ste. Marie, he 
  would be held in a facility in Sudbury, a four hour bus ride from Sault Ste. 
  Marie where the court proceedings would take place. Pardu J. also observed that 
  the respondent's lawyer who lived and practised in Sault Ste. Marie had not 
  been able to travel to Sudbury to see his client in the five weeks between his 
  arrest and the bail hearing. Pardu J. said:</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; These conditions would likely impair the accused's ability 
  to instruct counsel, and will diminish his ability to be attentive at his preliminary 
  inquiry and trial. Detention under these conditions, will not enhance confidence 
  in the administration of justice. </p>
<p>[6] The Crown initially submitted that Pardu J. erred by taking into account 
  the respondent's conditions of detention in determining whether bail should 
  be granted. The Crown's position was that under the tertiary grounds, the only 
  conditions open to the court to consider before granting release were the four 
  factors set out in s. 515(10)(c) of the Criminal Code: the apparent strength 
  of the Crown's case, the gravity of the nature of the offence, the circumstances 
  surrounding its commission and the potential for a lengthy term of imprisonment, 
  as well as the circumstances relating to these factors. </p>
<p>[7] In oral argument, however, Crown counsel properly acknowledged that detention 
  conditions could be a relevant consideration in a proper case. We agree. Where 
  the court is considering the granting of bail, as opposed to reasons for denying 
  bail, the court may consider any appropriate factors that impact on the issue 
  of the maintenance of confidence in the administration of justice.</p>
<p>[8] In our view, Pardu J. made no error in this case by considering the respondent's 
  detention conditions as a factor that impacted on the maintenance of confidence 
  in the administration of justice and militated in favour of granting bail. </p>
<p>[9] The Crown also argued that, in any event, Pardu J. erred in her conclusion 
  that in the circumstances of this case, the respondent should be released. The 
  Crown submitted that under both the secondary and tertiary grounds bail should 
  have been denied.</p>
<p>[10] In our view, Pardu J. made no error in her determination based on the 
  record before her that the respondent was not likely to re-offend if released 
  and that detention was not required for the proper maintenance of public confidence 
  in the administration of justice.</p>
<p>[11] Accordingly, we would not interfere with the decision of Pardu J. to grant 
  judicial interim release on the terms that she did.</p>
<p>[12] In the course of argument, s. 31.1 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act was 
  raised. That section clearly applies to the issue of judicial interim release 
  for young persons. In this case, however, the section was not raised before 
  Pardu J. nor is it necessary for this court to consider it in light of the conclusion 
  we have reached.</p>
<p>[13] The decision of Pardu J., therefore, is confirmed.</p>
