<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Counsel have carefully reviewed the evidence with us. We are satisfied 
  that the findings of fact by the trial judge are supported by the evidence and 
  that based on those findings it was open to the trial judge to find that there 
  was an undisclosed latent defect. Dealing with the particular issues raised 
  by the appellant:</p>
<p class="indent">1. There was abundant evidence that the son was acting as agent 
  for his mother. He hired Mr. Stewart, made assurances to the plaintiff and generally 
  held himself out as his mother's agent. In any event, the plaintiffs also had 
  direct dealings with Mrs. Vaughan and she was found to have made false statements 
  in the disclosure statement and in conversation with Mr. Sulliman.</p>
<p class="indent">2. It was open to the trial judge to accept Mr. Sulliman's evidence 
  that he was unaware of the widespread wood rot in the crawl space. We think 
  the evidence at p. 69 in context only refers to the limited problem near the 
  door of which the plaintiffs were aware.</p>
<p class="indent">3. It was also open to the trial judge to accept that Mr. Vaughan 
  knew of the widespread wood rot in the crawl space and that this was a latent 
  defect</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $10,000 inclusive 
  of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
