<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Nancy L. Backhouse of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 20, 2002.</p>    <P>
  GOUDGE J.A.:</p>    <P>
  [1] The appellant came into existence on June 26, 1998, as a result of the Sunnybrook 
  and Women's College Health Sciences Centre Act, 1998, S.O. 1998, c. 12 (the 
  SWC Act). Section 21 of that Act provides in part that the appellant's property 
  &quot;shall not be liable to taxation for provincial purposes &#133;&quot;</p>    <P>
  [2] Effective December 5, 2001 the respondent amended the Retail Sales Tax Act, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. R.31 (the RST Act) by adding s. 1.1 to that Act. It reads as 
  follows:</p>    
<P class="indent"> 1.1 No person otherwise subject to tax under this Act is exempt 
  therefrom by reason of an exemption granted to the person, or to or in respect 
  of the personal or real property of the person, by or under any other Act, unless 
  the other Act expressly mentions this Act.</p>    
<P>
  [3] The question in this appeal is whether this amendment removed the appellant's 
  protection against having to pay retail sales tax.</p>    <P>
  [4] Backhouse J. found that it did so. For the reasons that follow, I agree 
  and would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>    <P>
  THE FACTS</p>    <P>
  [5] The appellant was created in 1998 by the coming together of three predecessor 
  hospitals: Sunnybrook Hospital, the Orthopaedic and Arthritic Hospital, and 
  Women's College Hospital. This was effected through the SWC Act, by which Sunnybrook 
  Hospital and the Orthopaedic and Arthritic Hospital were amalgamated and continued 
  as the appellant, and the rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of Women's 
  College Hospital were transferred to the appellant.</p>    <P>
  [6] Sunnybrook Hospital began as a veterans' hospital. It was built by the federal 
  government and operated by it until it was transferred to provincial jurisdiction 
  pursuant to The Sunnybrook Hospital Act, 1966, S.O. 1966, c. 150. Section 10(3) 
  of that Act provided the following: </p>    <P class="indent"> 10.(3) The real and personal property vested in Sunnybrook 
  Hospital and any lands and premises leased to or occupied by Sunnybrook Hospital 
  shall not be liable to taxation for provincial, municipal or school purposes, 
  and shall be exempt from every description of taxation so long as the same are 
  actually used and occupied for the purposes of Sunnybrook Hospital.</p>    
<P>
  [7] In 1995, a dispute arose between the respondent and Sunnybrook Hospital 
  over whether s. 10(3) exempted the latter from retail sales tax. Sunnybrook 
  Hospital commenced a motion for a declaration that it was exempt, which was 
  heard together with a similar motion brought by the Ontario Cancer Institute. 
  The motion judge, Lederman J., issued reasons for judgment on August 26, 1997, 
  which are reported as Ontario Cancer Institute v. Ontario (Minister of Revenue) 
  (1997), 150 D.L.R. (4th) 351 (Ont. Gen. Div.). He concluded that the wording 
  of s. 10(3) was sufficiently broad to relieve Sunnybrook Hospital from retail 
  sales tax under the RST Act. Because the parties had confined the issue before 
  him to liability for retail sales tax on goods or personal property consumed 
  or used, Lederman J. limited his declaration to that. He did not deal with the 
  question of liability for retail sales tax on services or on insurance premiums 
  which the RST Act also covers. That question is the subject of other proceedings, 
  which have yet to be heard at first instance.</p>    <P>
  [8] On September 22, 1997, the respondent filed a notice of appeal from the 
  decision of Lederman J. </p>    <P>
  [9] On June 26, 1998, Sunnybrook Hospital's exemption from taxation in s. 10(3) 
  of The Sunnybrook Hospital Act, 1966 was carried forward virtually verbatim 
  as s. 21(1) of the SWC Act. Added to it was a second provision exempting any 
  transfer of property from Women's College Hospital to the appellant from both 
  retail sales tax and land transfer tax. Section 21 of the SWC Act provided as 
  follows: </p>    
<P class="indent"> 21. (1) All real and personal property vested in the corporation 
  and all lands and premises leased to or occupied by the corporation shall not 
  be liable to taxation for provincial, municipal or school purposes, and shall 
  be exempt from every description of taxation so long as the same are actually 
  used and occupied for the purposes of the corporation.</p>
<P class="indent">21. (2) The Retail Sales Tax Act and the Land Transfer Tax Act 
  do not apply to any transfer of property under subsection 4(1). </p>
<P>
  [10] On November 12, 1998, the respondent abandoned its appeal from the judgment 
  of Lederman J.</p>    <P>
  [11] By letter to the appellant dated December 22, 1999, the respondent acknowledged 
  that the appellant was not liable to pay retail sales tax on its purchases of 
  personal property. Over the next two years, the respondent gave no indication 
  to the appellant that it was considering trying to reverse this position.</p>    <P>
  [12] However, on December 5, 2001, the government of Ontario proclaimed in force 
  omnibus Bill 127 (Responsible Choices for Growth and Fiscal Responsibility Act 
  (Budget Measures), 2001, S.O. 2001, c. 23). Section 189 of Bill 127 added s.1.1 
  to the RST Act under the heading &quot;exemption from other acts&quot;. At the 
  same time, Bill 127 added a provision in identical terms to four other acts 
  by including a new s. 1.1 in each of the Fuel Tax Act, the Gasoline Tax Act, 
  the Tobacco Tax Act, and the Land Transfer Tax Act.</p>    <P>
  [13] On January 14, 2002, the respondent wrote to the appellant to say that 
  as a result of the addition of s. 1.1 to the RST Act, the appellant was required 
  to start paying retail sales tax as of December 5, 2001.</p>    <P>
  [14] In response, on January 24, 2002, the appellant issued a notice of application 
  under Rule 14 of the Rules of Civil Procedure seeking a declaration that it 
  continues after December 4, 2001 to be exempt from the RST Act pursuant to s. 
  21 of the SWC Act. </p>    <P>
  [15] Backhouse J. dismissed the appellant's application. The core of her reasoning 
  is as follows:</p>    
<P class="indent"> [11] With the passage of Section 1.1, a specific reference 
  to the Retail Sales Tax Act is now required. Section 21(1) [of the SWC Act] 
  does not include any reference to the Retail Sales Tax Act. Is the limited reference 
  in Section 21(2) sufficient. Although Section 1.1 of the Retail Sales Tax Act 
  is not as clearly expressed as it might be, nevertheless, it seems reasonably 
  clear that the reference to the Retail Sales Tax Act must reflect an intention 
  to exclude the Retail Sales Tax Act from generally applying. The intent of Section 
  21(2) is limited to the purposes of Section 4(1). It would not be reasonable 
  to interpret a reference which on its face has a limited effect to create a 
  general exclusion. In my opinion, therefore, Section 21(2) is not sufficient 
  to attract a general exemption from the Retail Sales Tax Act.</p>    
<P>
  ANALYSIS</p>    <P>
  [16] The respondent raises two preliminary issues which it says are fatal to 
  the appeal.</p>    <P>
  [17] First it argues that the RST Act provides a complete code for determining 
  liability to pay retail sales tax and that this precludes the appellant's right 
  to bring an application for a declaration pursuant to Rule 14.</p>    <P>
  [18] I disagree. While the RST Act sets out detailed procedures to be followed 
  if a taxpayer objects to a particular retail sales tax assessment or seeks a 
  refund of a payment made in error, that is not this case. The appellant seeks 
  neither of these. Rather, it seeks a declaration that it is exempt from the 
  RST Act altogether, because of s. 21(1) of the SWC Act and despite s. 1.1 of 
  the RST Act. This is precisely the kind of proceeding contemplated by Rule 14.05(3) 
  which authorizes the bringing of an application for the determination of rights 
  that depend on the interpretation of a statute. Moreover, there is no provision 
  in the RST Act which suggests that the procedures it contains constitute the 
  only ways in which a taxpayer can bring a challenge of any kind to the RST Act. 
  It was therefore entirely proper for this case to be brought as an application 
  pursuant to Rule 14. </p>    <P>
  [19] The respondent's second preliminary argument is that s. 21(1) of the SWC 
  Act provides the appellant with no exemption from retail sales tax because the 
  section of The Sunnybrook Act, 1966 interpreted by Lederman J. was repealed 
  with the passage of the SWC Act and because if s. 21(1) provides a general exemption 
  from retail sales tax, s. 21(2) would be unnecessary.</p>    <P>
  [20] Again, I disagree. The respondent did not take this position before the 
  motion judge. Indeed its advice to the appellant following the passage of the 
  SWC Act contradicts this position, when it said that the appellant was not liable 
  to pay retail sales tax on personal property. It reversed this position only 
  after the addition of s. 1.1 to the RST Act in December 2001. Moreover, in University 
  Health Network v. Ontario (Minister of Finance) (2001), 208 D.L.R. (4th) 459 
  (Ont. C.A.) the respondent took the position that s. 21(1) of the SWC Act constituted 
  a tax exemption provision. Finally, in that case this court found that this 
  section continued the exemption in The Sunnybrook Act, 1966. </p>    <P>
  [21] That conclusion is unassailable in my view. Section 21(1) of the SWC Act 
  is virtually a verbatim re-enactment of s. 10(3) in the 1966 Act, the section 
  that Lederman J. declared to provide an exemption from retail sales tax on personal 
  property. The respondent abandoned its appeal from that judgment. Section 21(1) 
  must be taken to provide the same exemption to the appellant as of June 26, 
  1998.</p>    <P>
  [22] Nor can it be said that the presence of s. 21(2) affects this conclusion. 
  Section 21(2) adds a second more precise exemption from the RST Act for the 
  transfer of property from Women's College Hospital. The addition of this second 
  exemption does not implicitly alter the meaning given by Lederman J. to the 
  language that now appears in s. 21(1) namely, that it is sufficiently broad 
  to relieve the appellant from retail sales tax on personal property.</p>    <P>
  [23] Thus in my view, the decision of Lederman J., the respondent's abandonment 
  of its appeal from it, and the re-enactment of the same statutory language in 
  s. 21(1) of the SWC Act mean that after June 26, 1998 the appellant continued 
  to have a general exemption from retail sales tax at least on personal property, 
  as part of the broad exemption from taxation provided by s. 21(1). </p>    <P>
  [24] The central question is whether the addition of s. 1.1 to the RST Act on 
  December 5, 2001 brought that to an end. It can be addressed only against the 
  backdrop of the wording of these sections. </p>    <P>
  [25] To reiterate, s. 1.1 of the RST Act reads:</p>    
<P class="indent"> 1.1 No person otherwise subject to tax under this Act is exempt 
  therefrom by reason of an exemption granted to the person, or to or in respect 
  of the personal or real property of the person, by or under any other Act, unless 
  the other Act expressly mentions this Act.</p>    
<P>
  [26] Section 21 of the SWC Act reads:</p>    
<P class="indent"> 21. (1) All real and personal property vested in the corporation 
  and all lands and premises leased to or occupied by the corporation shall not 
  be liable to taxation for provincial, municipal or school purposes, and shall 
  be exempt from every description of taxation so long as the same are actually 
  used and occupied for the purposes of the corporation.</p>
<P class="indent">21.(2) The Retail Sales Tax Act and the Land Transfer Tax Act 
  do not apply to any transfer of property under subsection 4(1). </p>
<P>
  [27] The appellant puts forward two arguments. First, it says that s. 21(1) 
  of the SWC Act has two components. The first part of the subsection confers 
  an immunity from taxation for provincial purposes. The second part grants an 
  exemption from tax. Since s. 1.1 of the RST Act speaks only to an &quot;exemption&quot; 
  granted by any other act, it leaves unaffected the appellant's immunity from 
  taxation. In other words, the appellant says that s. 1.1 has no application 
  because the appellant's immunity means it is not a &quot;person otherwise subject 
  to tax&quot; under the RST Act.</p>    <P>
  [28] In my view, this argument fails because in order to distinguish the first 
  part of s. 21(1) from an exemption, the argument seeks to apply a specialized 
  and narrow notion of immunity which cannot be sustained in the circumstances. 
  The statutory language of the first part of the section speaks of not being 
  liable to taxation for provincial purposes. It does not speak of an immunity 
  from tax. In interpreting the predecessor legislation, s. 10(3) of The Sunnybrook 
  Hospital Act, 1966, Lederman J. uses the language of exemption in describing 
  the protection it gives from provincial tax.</p>    <P>
  [29] Moreover, contrary to the appellant's submission, this statutory language 
  could not create an immunity analogous to the doctrine of inter-governmental 
  immunity found in s. 125 of the Constitution Act, 1867. By enacting the first 
  part of s. 21(1), the province has not created an immunity analogous to inter-governmental 
  immunity. It has not thereby put beyond its own power the later removal of the 
  protection from retail sales tax. The only question is whether it has now done 
  so, with s. 1.1 of the RST Act. </p>    <P>
  [30] In summary, in saying that the appellant shall not be liable to taxation 
  and that it shall be exempt from taxation, s. 21(1) of the SWC Act is simply 
  describing the exemption it confers in two different ways. Indeed in the New 
  Shorter Oxford Dictionary &quot;exempt&quot; is defined as &quot;grant immunity 
  or freedom from a liability to which others are subject&quot;. This is consistent 
  with the overall purpose of the section, namely to provide the appellant with 
  broad protection against taxation which must be taken to extend to a general 
  exemption from retail sales tax on personal property.</p>    <P>
  [31] The appellant's second argument is that s. 1.1 of the RST Act does not 
  remove the retail sales tax exemption provided by s. 21(1) of the SWC Act because 
  the SWC Act expressly mentions the RST Act in s. 21(2). In other words, the 
  appellant says that the language chosen by the legislature in enacting s. 1.1 
  expressly preserves the appellant's exemption.</p>    <P>
  [32] On the other hand, the respondent's position is that while s. 1.1 of the 
  RST Act does not remove the partial exemption from retail sales tax in s. 21(2) 
  of the SWC Act, it does remove the general exemption from that tax provided 
  by s. 21(1).</p>    <P>
  [33] The debate then is not about whether s. 1.1 of the RST Act repeals s. 21(1) 
  of the SWC Act altogether. Setting aside retail sales tax, the broad exemption 
  from provincial taxation provided by s. 21(1) remains unimpaired. What is at 
  stake is whether s. 1.1 of the RST Act narrows that broad exemption to remove 
  from it the general protection against retail sales tax.</p>    <P>
  [34] The answer to this question depends on the interpretation of the last phrase 
  in s. 1.1 of the RST Act. The appellant is otherwise subject to tax under the 
  RST Act save for the exemption given to it by s. 21(1) of the SWC Act. Section 
  1.1 removes that exemption unless the SWC Act &quot;expressly mentions&quot; 
  the RST Act. </p>    <P>
  [35] I would approach this task of statutory interpretation guided by the words 
  of Laskin J.A. in University Health Network, supra at para. 25:</p>    
<P class="indent"> The modern approach to statutory interpretation calls on the 
  court to interpret a provision in its total context. The court's interpretation 
  should comply with the legislative text, promote the legislative purpose and 
  produce a reasonable and just meaning. In short, the court must take into account 
  all relevant indicators of legislative meaning. See Ruth Sullivan, Driedger 
  on the Construction of Statutes, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1994) at p. 
  131.</p>    
<P>
  [36] Moreover as Gonthier J. said in Qu&eacute;bec (Communaut&eacute; urbaine) 
  v. Corporation Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 3 at 20 the interpretation 
  of tax legislation should follow the ordinary rules of interpretation. There 
  can be no automatic presumption that a legislative provision purporting to remove 
  a tax exemption must be interpreted narrowly. Such a provision must be approached 
  like any other, and only if, in the end, there is a reasonable doubt about the 
  legislative meaning that is not resolved by the ordinary rules of interpretation 
  can there be recourse to a residual presumption in favour of the taxpayer.</p>    <P>
  [37] What then are the possible interpretations of the last phrase of s. 1.1 
  of the RST Act and how do they measure up, given the modern approach to statutory 
  interpretation?</p>    <P>
  [38] One possibility can readily be discarded. I do not think that the phrase 
  can encompass an express mention of the RST Act in the exempting Act where that 
  reference has nothing whatsoever to do with an exemption from retail sales tax. 
  Section 1.1 of the RST Act cannot have contemplated that where in an Act which 
  inter alia grants a general exemption from retail sales tax, the legislature 
  also expressly mentions the RST Act but for a purpose having nothing to do with 
  exemption from retail sales tax, this intention should be transformed into one 
  with a different purpose, namely the removal of the general exemption from retail 
  sales tax. To interpret s. 1.1 this way would set up the capricious result that 
  a legislative provision designed for one purpose would achieve a second purpose 
  entirely unreflected in the provision itself.</p>    <P>
  [39] The interpretation urged by the appellant is that s. 1.1 removes the exemption 
  from retail sales tax unless the exempting Act expressly mentions the RST Act 
  in the context of some exemption from retail sales tax, but not necessarily 
  in the context of the exemption that would otherwise be removed. In this case, 
  the mention of the RST Act in s. 21(2) which grants a specific exemption from 
  retail sales tax for property transferred from Women's College Hospital would 
  thus be sufficient to preserve the general exemption from that tax in s. 21(1).</p>    <P>
  [40] On the other hand, the respondent's position is that the express mention 
  must be in the provision which accords the exemption that would otherwise be 
  removed. In this case that would require an express mention of the RST Act in 
  s. 21(1) of the SWC Act. </p>    <P>
  [41] In my view, the proper interpretation of s. 1.1 of the RST Act is closer 
  to that contended for by the respondent.</p>    <P>
  [42] I begin with the legislative text. It states that if an exempting Act is 
  to extend to providing protection from retail sales tax, the exempting Act must 
  &quot;expressly mention&quot; the RST Act. This requirement suggests that the 
  reference must be more than a mere mention. It must be a mention expressed for 
  a purpose of relevance in the context, namely the exemption provided by the 
  exempting Act that is thereby preserved. Here this can only mean that the mention 
  must express an intention to preserve the general retail sales tax exemption 
  within the broad exemption provided by the exempting Act. In other words, I 
  think that the text of s. 1.1 suggests that the exempting Act must mention the 
  RST Act in a way that expresses an intention to preserve the exemption from 
  retail sales tax that would otherwise be removed.</p>    <P>
  [43] In my view, this accords with the legislative purpose of s. 1.1, namely 
  to ensure that if the legislature intends an exemption from provincial taxation 
  to encompass retail sales tax it must expressly say so. This provision, like 
  the others introduced at the same time for fuel tax, gasoline tax, tobacco tax 
  and land transfer tax, is intended to ensure that a general legislative exemption 
  from provincial tax would include these specific exemptions only if the exempting 
  Act expresses that intention through the express mention of the particular Act. 
  </p>    <P>
  [44] Moreover, this interpretation of s. 1.1 gives the provision a meaning which 
  is reasonable and just. It is reasonable to require that if the legislature 
  intends an exempting Act to extend to retail sales tax, it must refer to the 
  RST Act in the exempting Act in a way that reflects this intention.</p>    <P>
  [45] On the other hand, it does not seem reasonable that if the legislature 
  desires an exempting Act to provide protection from retail sales tax, this can 
  be accomplished by a reference to the RST Act which the legislature meant to 
  provide a different and lesser exemption.</p>    <P>
  [46] In summary, I interpret s. 1.1 of the RST Act to mean that if a statute 
  is to provide a general exemption from retail sales tax, it must mention the 
  RST Act in a way that reflects that intention. </p>    <P>
  [47] Applying that interpretation to the SWC Act, the result is clear. While 
  s. 21(1) must be taken to provide a general exemption from retail sales tax, 
  at least for personal property, there is no mention in the SWC Act of the RST 
  Act that reflects that intention.</p>    <P>
  [48] The only mention of the RST Act is in s. 21(2) which reflects a different 
  intention, namely to protect the appellant from retail sales tax, but only in 
  connection with the transfer of property from Women's College Hospital. Given 
  the interpretation I have given to s. 1.1 of the RST Act, while that reference 
  is enough to preserve the partial exemption found in s. 21(2), it is not enough 
  to provide the general exemption from retail sales tax that, but for s. 1.1, 
  would be provided by s. 21(1) of the SWC Act.</p>    <P>
  [49] In the result therefore, I would dismiss the appeal. </p>    <P>
  [50] At the hearing of the appeal, the parties both submitted that costs should 
  follow the event on a partial indemnity basis. I agree. Costs to the respondent 
  are fixed in the amount of $5,000.</p>
