<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Silia Seppi of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated December 21, 2001.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>[1] The appellant Queensmeadow Developments Ltd. (QDL) appeals from the dismissal 
  of its claim to recover damages from the respondent for the amounts that it 
  agreed to pay to lien claimants in the consent judgment in the prior lien action. 
  The trial judge found that the appellant was obliged to prove in this action 
  the validity of the lien claims in the prior action, and failed to do so.</p>
<p>
  [2] In this court, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred and that 
  the respondent is estopped by conduct from contesting the validity of the lien 
  claims or that they were caused by the wrongful actions of the bank.</p>
<p>
  [3] We disagree.</p>
<p>
  [4] In this court counsel for the appellant (who was not counsel at trial) was 
  handicapped by the fact that estoppel by conduct was not pleaded or argued at 
  trial nor dealt with by the trial judge. No findings were made setting out the 
  precise nature of the representation by conduct said to have been made, nor 
  the detrimental reliance said to flow from it.</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant argues that the representation can be found in the finding 
  by the trial judge that the respondent indicated at the time of the consent 
  judgment that on the facts as related by the appellant it had a strong case 
  against the bank. However, the trial judge also found that the lien claimants 
  other than those claiming in this action were almost assured of recovery of 
  their total claims and that no one clarified the extent of recovery against 
  the bank. Hence, it is far from clear that the respondent's representation extended 
  to all lien claimants and included those claiming here, or that it went beyond 
  an assertion that the bank had wrongfully removed funds from the appellant's 
  account to implicitly include an assertion that this caused the default that 
  lead to the filing of the liens. The appellant simply cannot establish the necessary 
  representation for its estoppel by conduct argument. </p>
<p>
  [6] Nor can it establish the necessary reliance. The appellant says that reliance 
  is constituted by its remaining with the respondent as its lawyer, rather than 
  seeking other counsel to bring the action against the bank. However, the trial 
  judge made no finding to this effect. Indeed, the appellant continuing with 
  the respondent would seem to flow more logically from the respondent's undertaking 
  to commence the action, not from his opinion about the merits of the case which, 
  by itself, would not have been enough to get the appellant to give up seeking 
  other counsel to commence the action.</p>
<p>
  [7] Thus, we cannot agree that the respondent is estopped by conduct. The appellant 
  was required at trial to prove that the bank's actions caused valid lien claims 
  to be created. It failed to do so and its action to recover damages from the 
  respondent for the amount of those liens was properly dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant's second argument seeks return of the $10,000 retainer paid 
  from the holdback to the respondent. The appellant argues that there was a complete 
  failure of consideration for this payment. </p>
<p>
  [9] Again we disagree. Here too, there was no finding by the trial judge. However, 
  the retainer was not just for the action against the bank, which the respondent 
  failed to commence, but for other work as well, some of which appears to have 
  been performed. There would therefore seem to be no basis for the return of 
  the entire $10,000. This court is not in a position to determine at first instance 
  the proportion of the $10,000 used up by the services in fact performed.</p>
<p>
  [10] More importantly, the appellant QDL was found in the prior action not to 
  have a valid lien and therefore no claim to any part of the holdback. In the 
  consent judgment both the other plaintiffs gave up any claim to any part of 
  the holdback. Thus, none of them have any claim to a return of the $10,000 paid 
  from the holdback whether or not there was a complete failure of consideration.</p>
<p>
  [11] In the result, both the appellant's arguments fail and the appeal must 
  be dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [12] It is therefore unnecessary to deal with the respondent's arguments styled 
  by way of cross-appeal. They simply seek to sustain the order of the trial judge. 
  However, since these issues were argued we can say that we see nothing wrong 
  with the trial judge's finding that the limitation period to sue the bank had 
  expired and that, therefore, the respondent was negligent or with her finding 
  that the appellant could not have reasonably discovered the respondents' breach 
  before November 1989.</p>
<p>
  [13] The appeal is dismissed. Costs to the respondent fixed on a partial indemnity 
  basis at $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
