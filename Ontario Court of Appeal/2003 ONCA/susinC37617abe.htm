<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We would dismiss the appeal for the trial judge&#8217;s reasons.</p>
<p> [2] The action giving rise to this appeal was commenced approximately 25 years 
  after the event in question. </p>
<p> [3] In detailed reasons, the trial judge concluded that the action was statute-barred 
  by the Limitations Act or should be dismissed under the equitable doctrine of 
  laches. In these circumstances, it was not necessary for the trial judge to 
  deal with the issues of &#8220;onus&#8221; or &#8220;acquiescence&#8221;. Moreover, 
  the trial judge found there was no evidence of a breach of trust.</p>
<p> [4] Key documents, including the contract itself, have been lost or destroyed 
  and the parties to the contract have been dissolved. Key witnesses have passed 
  away and the memories of others have faded. The defendant has been substantially 
  prejudiced by the passage of time.</p>
<p> [5] The trial judge made no error of fact or law and his judgment should not 
  be disturbed. The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $7,500, all inclusive.</p>
