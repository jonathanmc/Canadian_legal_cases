<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice James M. Farley of the Superior Court
of Justice dated December 4, 2001.</p>
<p>FELDMAN and SIMMONS JJ.A.: </p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>
  [1] The trial judge tried this action on the basis of a consent order, paragraphs
    1 and 2 of which provide: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1. THIS COURT ORDERS that, pursuant to sections 214 and 241 of the Canada Business
  Corporations Act, the applicants or their nominees receive from the respondents
  or their nominees value for their interest in the respondent Vicbir Holdings
  Ltd. on such terms and in such manner, including without limiting the generality
  of the foregoing any reorganization under the Canada Business Corporations
  Act including a butterfly reorganization of the kind described in the Advance
  Income Tax ruling dated July 23, 1999 attached as Exhibit V to the affidavit
  of Robert William Massey Birks dated November 28, 2000 or otherwise, and at
  such price or value as determined by this Court.</p>
<p class="indent">2. THIS COURT ORDERS that all
      of the issues raised in paragraphs 1 (b) to 1 (j), 1 (l) and 1 (m) of the
      Notice of Application, as well as the issues in
    paragraph 1 hereof (such as value, terms, etc.), be tried by a judge of the
    Commercial List on an expedited basis pursuant to the schedule set out in
  paragraph 6 hereof.</p>
<p>
  [2] The issues raised in paragraphs 1(b) to 1(j), and 1(l) and 1(m) of the
  Notice of Application are: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (b) a declaration that the respondent Robert W.M. Birks has conducted the business
  and affairs of Vicbir and Vicbir Family Foundation in a manner oppressive or
  unfairly prejudicial to or that unfairly disregards the interests of the applicants,
  breaching statutory and fiduciary duties owed to Vicbir and the applicants,
  including a duty to act honestly and in good faith in the best interests of
  Vicbir;</p>
<p class="indent">(c)	an order for the division of Vicbir's and Vicbir Family Foundation's
  assets on a pro-rata basis, taking into account the accrued rights of the applicants
  and the other orders sought in this Application; [dealt with in a separate
  judgment of Farley J.]</p>
<p class="indent">(d) an order for a full accounting of the business and affairs of Vicbir and
    Vicbir Family Foundation including, full and unrestricted access to all books
    and records of Vicbir and Vicbir Family Foundation, an order for an equitable
    tracing of its property, and an order requiring the respondent Robert W.M.
    Birks to repay to Vicbir all professional fees, salary and other amounts improperly
    or imprudently paid to himself, Jack Miller, Scott Wilson and other persons;</span></p>
<p class="indent"> (e) an order for an independent review of the 1989 disposition
    of shares in Henry Birks &amp; Sons Ltd. and re-allocation of the proceedings
  among the parties;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (f) an order requiring the respondent Robert W.M. Birks to return Vicbir property
  to Vicbir;</p>
<p class="indent"> (g)	an order reversing the respondent Robert W.M.
    Birks' acquisition
  of the applicant Susan S. Dwyer's 95 common shares or a corresponding
  adjustment;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (h) an order requiring Robert W.M. Birks to transfer Fourth Preferred Shares
  obtained by him in 1995 to the applicants so as to allocate control equally
  in Vicbir among Robert W.M. Birks and the applicants or a corresponding adjustment;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) interim and final orders compensating the applicants for dividends in an
  amount ultimately to be determined by the accounting ordered by this Court;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (j) an order that Robert pay compensation to each of the applicants as aggrieved
  persons for his oppressive and unfairly prejudicial conduct in an amount of
  $1 million;</p>
<p class="center">
&#8230;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (l) interim and final orders enjoining the respondent Robert W.M. Birks from
  utilizing the assets of Vicbir or Vicbir Family Foundation to fund his defence
  of the Application and from making or causing to be made any dispositions,
  expenditures or decisions with respect to the business of Vicbir and the Vicbir
  Family Foundation without leave of this Court or until disposition of the Application;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (m)	costs of this proceeding on a solicitor and client basis, plus GST;</p>
<p>
  [3]	Following a trial, the trial judge ordered that the respondents' shares
  be purchased by the corporation for cancellation and that the following adjustments
  be incorporated into the value to be received by the respondents (para. 58
  of the reasons): </p>
<p class="indent">
  a. Professional fees as to $1.1 million plus interest are to be added back
  in.</p>
<p class="indent">b.	The allocation of proceeds from Jon's purchase
    is to be adjusted as aforesaid to have Vicbir reimbursed for the legal accounts
    plus an attributable
    earnings growth rate on such reimbursement as discussed above.</span></p>
<p class="indent"> c.	Sue's interest is to be readjusted for her
    deemed reacquisition of 5 of the 1992 40 shares sold to Rob and 15 shares
  of the 1994 sale. </p>
<p class="indent">
  d.	There is to be no minority or marketability discount.</p>
<p class="indent">
  e.	Vicbir is not to be burdened by a pension reserve for Rob.</p>
<p class="indent"> f. As per the Neil Harris April 8, 2001 report Vicbir
    is to structure the deemed dividend so that there is a capital dividend to
    the extent of the CDA. This
  is designed to utilize the full amount of the CDA available, not just the sisters' pro
  rata share (an adjustment (below) will be made to the RDTOH account), to the
  extent necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">
  g.	. . . (superseded by a subsequent order).</p>
<p class="indent"> h.	If after applying the CDA in (f) above, there
    are taxable dividends, then "each
  of the sisters holding companies" is to receive a compensating credit
  based on the following formula (as to their pro rata interest): Add their pro
  rata interest in the CDA plus 50% of the pro rata interest in the RDTOH and
  subtract therefrom the CDA actually utilized.</p>
<p class="indent">
  i. The valuation date is taken as December 31, 2000. Book value is to be adjusted
  to market.</p>

<p>
  [4]	The appellant raises three categories of grounds of appeal: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1. Process: The trial judge misunderstood his function under the consent order
  and valued the respondents' interest in the appellant company using oppression
  principles after making a finding of oppression. Instead his function was to
  value the respondents' interest based on the "compact of shareholders",
  that is the intent of the father who set up the company and therefore the understanding
  of the children regarding the value of the shares, based on that understanding.
  That value included deductions for a salary for Robert Birks, a pension for
  Robert Birks, a minority discount because the intent of the company was to
  provide financial security for the family but within the control and supervision
  of the father, the mother and Robert Birks, with no control in the respondents,
  and a substantial reserve to care for Doreen Birks, the wife of Victor and
  mother of Robert, Susan and Lorna. Only after valuing the interest based on
  those valuation criteria was the trial judge to apply any adjustments based
  on any findings of oppression that he might make. The trial judge also erred
  in his valuation by failing to adjust for embedded taxes, disposition costs,
  and Robert Birks' salary.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Oppression: The trial judge erred in his
  findings of oppression and in the remedy he imposed. First, the trial judge
  erred in effectively overruling
  the decision of the Board of Directors not to declare dividends by finding
  that Robert Birks' decision not to declare dividends, which he directed
  the Board to implement, was an act of oppression. Second, the court gave remedies
  for share transactions between Susan and Robert which were not corporate transactions
  but transactions between shareholders. Third, the trial judge erred by providing
  remedies for actions which occurred over 6 years before the action was commenced
  and were therefore untimely and beyond the reach of the court.</p>
<p class="indent">3.	Error in
  dividing the corporation's tax accounts: The trial judge's
  formula may offend the General Avoidance Rule under the Income Tax Act, and
  therefore might result in a reassessment.</p>
<p>
  [5] In our view, the trial judge made no error in respect of the matters raised
  under issues 1 and 2. We agree that the trial judge did err in his treatment
  of the two tax accounts in paras. 58 f. and h. The respondents also challenged
  the trial judge's treatment of the corporate tax accounts in their cross-appeal,
  but on the basis that the formula does not achieve the result of fully compensating
  them for the value of their shares. In our view, the error in the formula can
  be corrected on this appeal without the necessity of a further hearing where
  new evidence would be led. The third issue raised by the appellants is resolved
  by our disposition of the cross-appeal and, accordingly, will be dealt with
  as part of the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  [6] The facts are fully set out in the reasons for judgment of Farley J. dated
  December 4, 2001 and it is unnecessary for the purposes of this appeal to repeat
  them here.</p>
<p>
  Disposition Of The Subissues Raised Under Issues (1) And (2)</p>
<p>[7] The appellant suggested in argument that there were no pleadings in this
  action which was tried on the Commercial List based on the consent order and
  the affidavits filed by the parties in accordance with the order, and that
  as a result, the issues were not defined, leaving the trial judge to use facts
  arising from the evidence to make decisions not anticipated by the parties. </p>
<p>
  [8] There is no merit in this submission. In response, the respondents point
  to the Trial Requirements Memorandum, prepared and submitted by both sides
  as required in accordance with the practice on the Commercial List. The memorandum
  includes a list of 5 issues to be resolved as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1. Has there been oppression in the manner in which Robert Birks conducted
  the business and affairs of Vicbir and Vicbir Family Foundation and, if so,
  what is the remedy?</p>
<p class="indent">2. On what terms, in which manner and for what price or
  value should Vicbir be divided among the parties?</p>
<p class="indent">3.	Should any assets be "added back" to Vicbir
  for valuation purposes for the purposes of issue 2 above: should there be a
  re-allocation of the proceeds
  of the 1989 disposition of shares in Henry Birks &amp; Sons Ltd.; should there
  be an accounting for professional and advisory fees paid by Vicbir; should
  the $2 million contribution to the Vicbir Family Foundation be included as
  a Vicbir asset for valuation purposes, etc.?</p>
<p class="indent">4. Does Susan have the right to
    re-purchase shares sold to Robert in 1992 and 1994, and to recover shares
  paid as amends to Robert in 1991?</p>
<p class="indent">5. Should the Fourth Preferred Shares transferred
    to Robert by his mother in 1995 be redistributed so as to allocate control
    equally in Vicbir among Robert
    and his sisters?</p>
<p>[9] These issues are set out verbatim by the trial judge in his reasons at
  paragraph 3 following a summary of the facts, with the notation that the fifth
  issue was no longer outstanding between the parties, and that the Foundation
  issues were dealt with in separate reasons. He then proceeded to address the
  issues. There can be no suggestion of procedural misunderstanding. </p>
<p>
  [10] Furthermore, the reasons of the trial judge demonstrate that in valuing
  the shares based on the reasonable expectations of the sisters, he took into
  account those wishes of the father in setting up the company that he found
  formed part of their reasonable expectations from time to time. He did not
  ignore any alleged obligations on the minority shareholders resulting from
  the father's gift, but took into account the alleged burdens on the shares
  in his assessment of the reasonable expectations of the parties over time.</p>
<p>
  [11] Although the trial judge made findings of oppression against Robert Birks
  in his role as controller of Vicbir in his dealings with his sisters, in his
  analysis of the value of the shares of the company, the trial judge referred
  to the reasonable expectations of the parties based on the history of the company
  as well as events as they occurred. In discussing Robert Birks' motive
  for maintaining the status quo from the time of Miller's opinion letter
  in 1990 that a dividend /income policy for the company was necessary to avoid
  a legitimate claim for wind-up, the trial judge stated at para. 32: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There was no appreciated incentive for him to do anything. The status quo was
  fine by him. In doing nothing, it appears to me that he did not appreciate
  or regard (and so unfairly disregarded) his sisters' reasonable expectations
  of having a policy in Vicbir which would look after Mother and thereafter afford
  them some regular flow of funds.</p>
<p>
  [12] This statement amounts to a finding by the trial judge of the reasonable
  expectations of the sisters which, after the lawyer Miller's advice,
  included an income policy but also a recognition of Mother's interest.
  Mother's needs are not accounted for at the time of valuation because,
  before her death, Mother transferred all of her personal wealth to her son
  Robert, who acknowledged that at that point, "having acquired all her
  interests, he is responsible for her well-being" (p. 6). </p>
<p>
  [13]	The trial judge also dealt with the issue of Robert Birks' salary
  for managing the portfolio and the corporate governance details by declining
  to add back the salary in valuing the company. The trial judge did not discuss
  any provision for future salary as a deduction from value. Clearly this would
  have made no sense as once the sisters' shares were purchased, any ongoing
  salary would be paid by the company, now wholly owned by Robert Birks.</p>
<p>
  [14] The trial judge rejected a provision for a pension for Robert Birks, making
  a specific finding that the reasonable expectations of the shareholders including
  Robert Birks "would be that Rob be provided for in his retirement by
  the wealth-managed assets of Vicbir in the same way as the other shareholders" (para.
  45). There is no basis to interfere with this finding.</p>
<p>
  [15] On the issue of a minority or marketability discount applying to the value
  of the sisters' shares, the trial judge relied on two bases for determining
  that no such discounts were appropriate in this situation. The first was that
  the consent order stated that the sisters would receive "value" for
  their interest, not "fair market value", and on that basis he concluded
  that the parties had effectively agreed that the usual discounts which are
  applied to achieve fair market value would not apply in this case. He went
  on, however, to conclude that without Robert's oppressive conduct in
  his control of the Board and of the company, the sisters would have received
  an ongoing income stream from their shares and eventually full value on a wind-up
  and distribution of the portfolio. Consequently, there was no reason for them
  to suffer a minority discount because their interest had to be bought out for
  them to achieve their reasonable expectations.</p>
<p>
  [16] The appellant suggests that the trial judge erred by not taking into account
  certain matters which were addressed by the expert appraisers in their reports.
  The first is subtracting the value of the preference shares. The respondents
  point out that the trial judge did not mention deducting the value of the preference
  shares because he was only valuing the common shares. They agree that the value
  of the preference shares must be deducted. The other matters are embedded taxes
  as a cost to Vicbir of disposition of its assets as well as the other costs
  of disposing of the assets. The appraisers did not agree on the value to be
  attributed to these factors. It appears that Farley J. determined that it would
  be appropriate to ignore embedded taxes and we would not interfere with that
  determination. In any event, our disposition of the cross-appeal addresses
  and deals with this issue.</p>
<p>
  [17] In relation to disposition costs, the appraisers agreed on basic disposition
  costs of 1% but disagreed on the applicability of a further discount based
  on disposition of the full portfolio. The trial judge provided that the value
  of the assets was to be adjusted from book value to market value. That adjustment
  could include appropriate disposition costs. Had the parties been able to agree
  on the figures following the release of the reasons of the trial judge, they
  may have been able to include an amount to account for these costs. As they
  did not agree, in our view it is appropriate to include 1% for disposition
  costs in order to bring the value of the assets up to market value. A discount
  based on a portfolio disposition is not consistent with the valuation method
  adopted by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [18]	The appellant appeals the trial judge's determination that the amount
  Vicbir paid for the legal costs of the litigation assigned to Jonathon Birks
  as part of the settlement in 1989, be added back to the company together with
  a reasonable rate of return on the money, as part of a proper allocation of
  the $22 million of settlement funds. The parties agreed after trial to assign
  a value of $900,000 to be added back to Vicbir. The appellant submits that
  there was no evidence or argument on the value of the litigation, that the
  adjustment occurred over 12 years before and was out of time, that the trial
  judge himself selected the legal fees paid as the value of the litigation,
  and that in fact the value of the litigation should have accrued to Robert
  and not to the company.</p>
<p>
  [19] We would not give effect to this submission. The trial judge spent a considerable
  portion of his reasons on the proper allocation of the $22 million sale of
  the Birks store shares, the voting trust certificates and the litigation. He
  referred to the Samson Report, commissioned at the time, which alluded to the
  fact that the litigation should be accorded some value. He reasoned that the
  litigation had tactical value to Robert and because it was financed by Vicbir
  and was difficult to value 13 years after the fact, a reasonable value was
  what Vicbir paid for it. In our view, it was within the discretion of the trial
  judge to make this determination and we would not interfere with it.</p>
<p>
  [20] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in awarding the respondents
  an add-back of $1.1 million for legal fees incurred by Vicbir that were expended
  for Robert's benefit over time. He submits that the amount acknowledged
  by Robert was $1 million and that the trial judge misapprehended the amount.
  It is clear from the reasons that the trial judge chose the amount of $1.1
  million as the mid-point between the $1 million suggested by Robert and the
  $1.2 million suggested by the sisters. In order to attribute interest fairly
  on that amount, which had been paid for legal fees over time, the trial judge
  divided the amount into segments to be treated as having been paid at designated
  points in time. The fact that a figure of $650,000 was treated as accruing
  interest from January 1989 does not, in our view, reflect confusion with the
  premium on legal fees paid to Mr. Miller in connection with the settlement
  with Jonathon Birks.</p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in not applying the doctrine
  of laches, or in giving an oppression remedy for matters that were not current,
  relying on the Manitoba Court of Appeal decision in Jaska v. Jaska (1996),
  141 D.L.R. (4th) 385. The trial judge considered and rejected the appellant's
  submission that laches should bar the remedy in this case. He found that any
  delay by the sisters did not reflect acquiescence on their part as they were
  trying to achieve some resolution with their brother since 1991, based on his
  promises. He also found that the appellant had not altered his position because
  of any delay, and that justice between the parties required a remedy to be
  given, not withheld. </p>
<p>
  [22] Jaska is not applicable here because it was decided under the Manitoba
  Limitations Act (Waxman v. Waxman, [2002] 25 B.L.R. (3d) 1 (Ont. S.C. J.)).
  In Jaska, the Manitoba Court of Appeal decided that the "basket clause" of
  the Limitations Act applied to oppression actions brought under Manitoba's
  Corporations Act. The Ontario Limitations Act does not have such a provision.
  The Court also stated that the scope and purpose of the oppression provisions
  of various corporations statutes requires that oppression actions be brought
  in a timely manner. On the facts of this case, the matters raised with respect
  to oppression are not stale and were raised in a timely manner. There is no
  basis to interfere with the trial judge's determination of this issue.</p>
<p>
  [23]	The appellant submits that the purchase of Susan's shares by Robert
  was not a corporate but a personal transaction and therefore not the proper
  subject of an oppression remedy. The trial judge specifically found that the
  portion of the shares for which he gave a remedy were sold by Susan because
  she needed money as a result of Robert's oppressive conduct of not allowing
  the company to pay dividends to the sisters. There is no basis to interfere
  with this finding.</p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in law by finding that
  failure to declare dividends could be an act of oppression, arguing that declaring
  dividends was a matter within the discretion of the directors. This argument
  was linked with the argument discussed above, that there was no basis for the
  sisters to have a reasonable expectation that the company would be a source
  of a steady income for them, rather than just a form of long-term financial
  security. The trial judge made no error. He was entitled to find that the Miller
  letter was accepted by the family and formed the basis for the reasonable expectation
  that the company would implement a dividend policy, and that although Robert
  also accepted this advice and agreed to implement it, his actions were intended
  and did have the effect of procrastination to avoid implementation.</p>
<p>Cross-appeal</p>
<p>
  [25] The respondents raise two issues by way of cross-appeal. First, they claim
    that the trial judge erred because he ordered a remedy that does not produce
    what he said he intended, namely, that the respondents receive the highest
    value for their Vicbir common shares, regardless of which method of distribution
    was selected. As part of the first issue, the respondents also claim that
    the trial judge ought to have ordered that Rob purchase their shares rather
    than ordering a share redemption by the company.</p>
<p>
  (1) The CDA and RDTOH Tax Accounts</p>
<p>
  [26]	The trial judge ordered that the respondents' Vicbir shares be purchased
  for cancellation based on a valuation formula that he devised, which included
  an unequal distribution of Vicbir's capital dividend account ("CDA")
  to the respondents as compensation for their share of Vicbir's refundable
  dividend tax on hand ("RDTOH"). The trial judge believed that the
  formula would result in the respondents receiving "appropriate value
  for their interest &#8230; in line with Rob's agreement that in principle
  they should receive &#8230; the most favourable [value] &#8230; of any of the
  reviewed proposals (i.e. double or single wing butterfly, windup, or purchase
  for cancellation)" [emphasis added]. He also said that the respondents
  should share in the CDA and RDTOH accounts "since they would have had
  the benefit of these accounts if they had remained shareholders unoppressed
  in Vicbir".</p>
<p>
  [27] The respondents submit that the trial judge erred in the articulation
  of the formula, because a distribution based on a notional wind-up produces
  a share value well in excess of the value produced by the trial judge's
  formula. In addition, they claim that the tax accounts adjustment does not
  work mathematically in the way the trial judge appeared to anticipate, with
  the result that they receive no value for Vicbir's RDTOH. Finally, the respondents
  claim that the trial judge should have ordered that Robert purchase their shares
  in Vicbir, because they should not have to bear the risk of what has happened
  in Vicbir subsequent to the valuation date and because that is the usual remedy
  ordered in oppression cases. </p>
<p>
  [28] We agree that the tax accounts adjustment set out in paras. 58 f. and
  h. contains an error and does not give the respondents appropriate compensation
  for their share of Vicbir's RDTOH. However, apart from correcting that
  error, we would not give effect to the respondents' submissions on this
  issue. We are satisfied that as corrected, the trial judge's formula
  achieves its intended purpose of giving the respondents "appropriate
  value for their interest &#8230; in line with Rob's agreement that in
  principle they should receive &#8230; the most favourable [value] &#8230; of
  any of the reviewed proposals (i.e. double or single wing butterfly, windup,
  or purchase for cancellation)".</p>
<p>
  [29] The trial judge attempted to compensate the respondents for their interest
  in the corporation's CDA and the RDTOH tax accounts by giving them the
  whole of the CDA as compensation for their pro rata share of the CDA and as
  partial compensation for their pro rata share of the RDTOH. He also created
  a formula for a compensating credit for any balance of their pro rata share
  of the RDTOH that was not fully recognized by allocating the excess CDA to
  them.</p>
<p>
  [30] The trial judge appears to have erred in structuring the compensating
  credit in a way which did not fully compensate the respondents for their interest
  in the corporation's RDTOH. This is illustrated by comparing the distribution
  the trial judge said the respondents were entitled to as compensation for their
  share of the RDTOH, with the actual value of their share of the RDTOH and with
  the amount they would get using his formula.</p>
<p>
  (a)	The Respondents' Pro Rata Share of the CDA <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  [31]	Using Susan's readjusted interest in the common shares of Vicbir,<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a>  the respondents had a combined total of 32.5% of the common shares as of December
  31, 2000. On that date, Vicbir's CDA was $1,946,585. Accordingly, the
  respondents' pro rata share of the CDA totalled $632,640 ($1,946,585
  x 32.5%). </p>
<p>
  (b)	The Value of the Respondents' Excess Share of the CDA as Partial
  Compensation for their Pro Rata Share of the RDTOH </p>
<p>
  [32] As partial compensation for their pro rata share of the RDTOH, the trial
  judge allocated to the respondents the CDA in excess of their pro rata share,
  namely, $1,313,945 ($1,946,585 - $632,640). The sum of $1,313,945 would therefore
  be paid to the respondents in the form of a capital dividend as part of the
  redemption price otherwise payable for their common shares. It is not itself
  an adjustment to the price and it does not, in itself, form part of the compensation
  for the respondents' share of the RDTOH. Rather, the compensation arises
  from the tax savings that the respondents would realize as a result of receiving
  payment in the form of capital dividends. Because shareholders receive capital
  dividends paid from the CDA on a tax-free basis, the respondents would realize
  tax savings in the amount of 31.33%<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> on the excess CDA forming part of the
  redemption price, amounting to $411,659 ($1,313,945 x 31.33%) in after-tax
  dollars. </p>
<p>
  (c)	The Compensating Credit for the Value of the Respondents' Share of
  RDTOH Not	Accounted for by the Allocation of Excess CDA </p>
<p>
  [33]	Using the trial judge's formula, the determination whether the respondents
  would be entitled to a compensating credit for the value of any part of their
  share of RDTOH not accounted for by allocating to them the excess CDA, required
  comparing the after-tax value of the respondents' pro rata share of the
  RDTOH to the tax they would save by receiving excess CDA </p>
<p>
  [34] As of December 31, 2000, the Vicbir RDTOH was $5,241,000, of which the
  respondents' undiscounted pro rata share was $1,703,325. Accordingly,
  the value of the respondents' pro rata share of the RDTOH is $1,169,674
  in after-tax dollars ($1,703,325 less 31.33%), whereas the tax savings they
  achieve from receiving excess CDA is only $411,659. Accordingly, the undiscounted
  value of the necessary compensating credit should be $758,015 in after-tax
  dollars ($1,169,674 - $411,659), or $1,103,852 in pre-tax dollars. However,
  the trial judge's formula does not produce such a credit.</p>
<p>
  [35]	The trial judge's formula in para. 58 h. for calculating the compensating
  credit is: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Add their [the sisters'] pro rata interest in the CDA plus 50% of the
  pro rata interest in the RDTOH and subtract therefrom the CDA actually utilized.  </p>
<p>The respondents' pro rata share of the CDA is $632,640 (32.5% x $1,946,585).
  Fifty per cent of their pro rata share of the RDTOH is $851,663 (50% x (32.5%
  x $5,241,000)). The CDA actually utilized is $1,946,585. The net result is
  a zero compensating credit, based on a negative result, namely -$462,282. This
  was not the intended effect.</p>

<p>
  [36] The formula for the compensating credit does not produce the intended
  result because it offsets a percentage of the RDTOH against the excess CDA
  allocated to the respondents, rather than offsetting the after-tax value of
  the RDTOH against the tax saved as a result of receiving the excess CDA. Put
  another way, the items the trial judge used to calculate the credit for RDTOH
  not accounted for in para. 58 f. are not equivalent, and consequently, do not
  produce an appropriate compensating credit.</p>
<p>
  [37] The trial judge did not explain how he arrived at the specific formula
  set out in para. 58 h. It is not clear whether the 50% discount stipulated
  in para. 58 h. is part of the arithmetic formula for calculating the compensating
  credit, or whether it was intended as some form of discount, such as a present
  value discount. Either way, in our view, it is not an appropriate discount.
  The calculations set out above demonstrate that the formula in paragraph 58
  h. does not achieve its intended effect, with or without the 50% discount.
  Further, in our view, a present value discount is not appropriate in this case.
  Although RDTOH would normally be distributed over time, because on a wind-up
  the RDTOH would be realized within a relatively compressed time frame, it should
  therefore be part of the calculation on a notional wind-up and requires no
  present value discount.</p>
<p>
  [38] Rather than attempting to correct the approach in para. 58 h., we would
  adopt a simpler approach and direct that Vicbir structure the dividend payments
  to the respondents so that they receive their pro rata share of the CDA and
  the resulting tax savings, and compensate them directly for their pro rata
  share of the RDTOH. </p>
<p>
  [39] Accordingly, in order to correct the unintended effect of subpara.58 h.
  as it currently stands, but to achieve the notional wind-up value intended
  by the trial judge, we would delete existing subparas. 58 f. and h. and substitute
  the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  f. Vicbir is to structure the deemed dividend so that the sisters receive a
  capital dividend to the extent of their pro rata share of the CDA.</p>
<p class="indent">h. Each of
      the sisters is to receive a compensating credit in the amount of their
  pro rata interest in the RDTOH.<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a> </p>
<p>
  [40] Because the respondents are no longer receiving more than their share
  of the CDA, the appellants' concern regarding the General Avoidance Rule
  is no longer relevant.</p>
<p>
  [41] In our view, given that the capital gains taxes payable by the corporation
  on a wind-up would be more or less equivalent to the benefits to the shareholders
  through the augmentations of the CDA and RDTOH accounts created by the realization
  of the capital gains which would be distributed on the wind-up, the trial judge's
  valuation method (as adjusted in these reasons), operates as a summary method
  of calculating notional wind-up value and we see no basis for ordering a different
  method of valuation or additional reports. Our review of the February 25, 2002
  report (the "Sohmer report") provided and relied on by the respondents
  does not dissuade us from this view.</p>
<p>
  [42]	Finally, we would not set aside the trial judge's order that the
  realization proceed by way of share redemption. In fashioning a remedy, the
  trial judge relied on the appellant's acknowledgment that the respondents
  should receive the highest value of any of "the reviewed proposals (i.e.
  double or single wing butterfly, windup, or purchase for cancellation)".
  On appeal, the respondents have also relied on the appellant's acknowledgment.
  Although, at trial, the respondents requested that Rob purchase their shares,
  that was not one of the options that the appellant referred to in its acknowledgment.
  In the circumstances, we see no basis for interfering with the trial judge's
  exercise of discretion in fashioning an appropriate remedy.</p>
<p>
  (2)	The "Amends"</p>
<p>
  [43] The second issue raised by the respondents on their cross-appeal is that
  the trial judge erred in holding that the oppression remedy is not flexible
  enough to provide relief to rectify the oppressive conduct of Rob in demanding
  that Susan turn over 40 common shares to him and pay him $19,000 by way of "amends".
  In the alternative, the respondents claim that the trial judge failed to consider
  the doctrine of unconscionability in disposing of this claim.</p>
<p>
  [44] We would not give effect to this ground of appeal. The trial judge made
  express findings that "the family bought into the question of amends" and
  that "payment of amends &#8230; fit within [Susan's] reasonable
  expectations of treatment". In our view, these findings were available
  on the record and the finding concerning Susan's reasonable expectations
  fully negates the suggestion of either oppression by Rob or of an unconscionable
  transaction. </p>
<p>
  Disposition of the Appeal and Cross-appeal</p>
<p> [45] We would dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal in part. Paragraphs 
  1 (g) and (h) of the judgment dated December 4, 2001 are deleted and the following 
  subparagraphs are substituted: </p>
<p class="indent"> g. the purchase shall be structured so that the applicants 
  receive a capital dividend to the extent of their pro rata share of the CDA.</p>
<p class="indent">h. each of the applicants
      is to receive a compensating credit in the amount of their pro rata interest
    in the RDTOH.</p>
<p>
  We would dismiss the balance of the cross-appeal.</p>

<p>
  Costs</p>
<p>
  [46] The parties have helpfully agreed on the quantum of costs. The issues
  are the award and the scale of costs. The respondents seek costs on the substantial
  indemnity scale for both the appeal and cross-appeal. The appellants submit
  that costs on the partial indemnity scale should follow the event. The trial
  judge also considered this issue and ordered costs on the partial indemnity
  scale to the respondents because of his view that there was mixed success and
  that although the conduct of Robert Birks was in some cases "atrocious",
  the respondents had also engaged in some "overreaching". </p>
<p>
  [47] The trial judge was in the best position to assess the situation having
  seen the parties and heard the evidence. We would follow his assessment and
  conclusion for the appeal as well. The respondents were wholly successful on
  the appeal and partially successful on the cross-appeal, but on a significant
  matter, which could have been resolved before Farley J. on a re-attendance.
  We would therefore award costs to the respondents of both the appeal and cross-appeal
  on the partial indemnity scale. The agreed figure is therefore $135,000.</p>
