<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John H. Brockenshire dated February 
  15, 2002 on an application under rule 14.05(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.<br>
</p>
<p>AUSTIN J.A.:<br>
</p>
<p>OVERVIEW<br>
</p>
<p>[1] The workers' compensation scheme in Ontario allows a worker, injured in 
  the course of employment, and in circumstances entitling the worker to sue a 
  third party for damages, to elect whether s/he will take the benefits provided 
  under the workers' compensation scheme or sue the party causing the injuries 
  for damages.<br>
</p>
<p>[2] If a worker first elects to take the workers' compensation benefits and 
  subsequently wishes to sue the third party, s/he may be allowed to re-elect 
  and pursue a claim in the courts, as long as s/he provides an undertaking to 
  reimburse the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (the Workers' Compensation 
  Board, until January 1, 1998; hereinafter &quot;the Board&quot;) for workers' 
  compensation benefits paid to the date of re-election.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] This is an appeal from the decision of Brockenshire J. dated February 15, 
  2002 in an application for interpretation of s. 10(4) of the Workers' Compensation 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. W-11 (hereinafter &quot;the WCA, 1990&quot;; currently, 
  and since January 1, 1998, s. 30(10) of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 
  S.O. 1997, c. 16, Schedule A, as am.) and s. 267(5) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. I.8. The need for interpretation of these two apparently conflicting 
  provisions arose in the context of a challenge by an injured worker to the Board's 
  claim for reimbursement of benefits paid to her.<br>
</p>
<p>[4] Brockenshire J. held that the Board did not have the right to require the 
  worker to agree to reimburse the Board for benefits she received from the Board, 
  before allowing her to re-elect and pursue a civil suit against the third party, 
  Thurlow. For the reasons which follow, I am of the opinion that the application 
  judge erred in his characterization of the issue and as a result erred in reaching 
  that conclusion.<br>
</p>
<p>Facts<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Lynda Sutor (&quot;Sutor&quot;), a nurse, was injured in a motor vehicle 
  accident in Ontario on September 3, 1993, while driving in the course of her 
  employment with the Victorian Order of Nurses. Jeffery Thurlow (&quot;Thurlow&quot;) 
  is alleged to be the person legally liable for her injuries. On September 27, 
  1993, Sutor elected to claim workers' compensation benefits under the WCA, 1990. 
  The election form she signed stated that:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">a) she had been in a motor vehicle accident on September 
  3, 1993 while at work under circumstances that might entitle her to sue a third 
  party;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">b) she was required to choose between claiming compensation 
  and suing a third party;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">c) the Board was not subrogated to any right of recovery 
  that she might have against a third party and could not commence an action against 
  that third party;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">d) if she elected to receive workers' compensation she 
  could not commence her own action against a third party without first withdrawing 
  her claim for compensation benefits with the approval of the Board and agreeing 
  to reimburse the Board for the full value of all compensation benefits awarded 
  to her or paid on her behalf.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] The Board began making payments to her or on her behalf as early as October 
  8, 1993 and continued until at least July 13, 1995. The payments for wage loss 
  replacement were at the rate of about $918 per week.</p>
<p>[7] On October 21, 1993 the Board wrote Sutor as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Some time ago you signed an Election to Claim form so 
  you could claim workers' compensation benefits.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">On June 22, 1990, the Province of Ontario passed a law 
  known as No-Fault Automobile Insurance. This law took away the right of the 
  Workers' Compensation Board to bring an action on your behalf if you were injured 
  in an accident involving a motor vehicle after October 23, 1989.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Even though the Board cannot bring an action on your 
  behalf, you may be able to. You may wish to speak to a lawyer to determine if 
  you can bring an action and claim your damages and losses from the responsible 
  party. If you want to bring your own action you must do the following:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">1. Complete and return the Withdrawal of Election form 
  which is enclosed. A self-addressed envelope is also enclosed.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">2. Agree to repay the Board all benefits paid to you 
  as well as medical care paid on your behalf and administrative expenses.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">We strongly suggest you consult a lawyer. Under Ontario 
  law you generally have two (2) years from the date of the accident to bring 
  an action. However, there are situations in which the limitation period is shorter. 
  You must start your law suit within the period allowed or your claim cannot 
  be brought. Your lawyer will be able to tell you which limitation period applies 
  and what action you should take.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to note that the Board does not pay 
  for independent legal advice; this is your responsibility.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Please advise the writer what action you wish to take.</p>
  
<p>[8] On receipt of this letter Sutor sought legal advice. The record before 
  this court does not indicate what response, if any, she made to this letter 
  from the Board. Payments to Sutor and on her behalf continued. An award for 
  impairment, i.e. permanent partial disability, was made in July 1995 in the 
  amount of $4,260.05 including interest.<br>
</p>
<p>[9] On August 25, 1995, on the advice of her solicitor, Sutor withdrew her 
  claim for compensation. The Board form she signed at that time reads as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Withdrawal of Claim for Workers' Compensation Benefits<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I, Lynn Sutor, hereby withdraw my claim for Workers' 
  Compensation Benefits so that I may commence a lawsuit for the injuries I sustained 
  in my accident.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I have read the foregoing and understand its contents 
  and agree to reimburse the Workers' Compensation Board the full value of the 
  Compensation Benefits received by me or paid for by the Board on my behalf. 
  <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I further understand and agree to obtain the prior approval 
  of the Board of any settlement of my action in order to preserve my right to 
  further compensation benefits under Section 8(2) of the Workers' Compensation 
  Act.</p>
  <p>Sutor's signature was witnessed by her solicitor. </p>
  
<p>[10] The form refers to s. 8(2) of the Workers' Compensation Act, R.S.O. 1980. 
  In 1990 it became s. 10(2) and in 1997 it became s. 30 of the Workplace Safety 
  and Insurance Act, 1997. The relevant parts, as of the date of the accident, 
  are in s. 10 of the WCA, 1990:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">10. (1) Where an accident arising out of and in the 
  course of a worker's employment happens to the worker under such circumstances 
  as entitle the worker or his or her dependants to an action against some person 
  other than the employer, . . . the worker or his or her dependants, if entitled 
  to benefits under this Part, may claim such benefits or may bring such action.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If less is recovered and collected by a judgment 
  in the action or by settlement than the amount of benefits to which the worker 
  or his or her dependants are entitled under this Part, the difference between 
  the amount recovered and collected and the amount of such benefits is payable 
  to the worker or his or her dependants.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Subsection (2) applies to a settlement only if the 
  approval of the Board to such settlement has been given before the settlement 
  is made.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(4) If the worker or his or her dependants elect to 
  claim benefits under this Act, . . . the Board, . . . [is] subrogated to all 
  rights of the worker or his or her dependants in respect of the injury to the 
  worker and may maintain an action in the name of the worker, . . . against the 
  person against whom the action lies and any amount recovered over and above 
  all amounts expended by the Board . . . shall be paid to the worker or his or 
  her dependants and any such surplus paid to the worker or his or her dependants 
  shall be deducted from the amount of any future compensation or other benefits 
  to which the worker or his or her dependants may become entitled in respect 
  of the accident that gave rise to the injury.<br>
</p>
<p class="center">. . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(6) The election shall be made and notice of it shall 
  be given within the time and in the manner provided by section 9. [Emphasis 
  added.]<br>
</p>
<p>[11] On August 31, 1995, as instructed by Sutor, her solicitors commenced an 
  action against Thurlow, to recover damages for the injuries suffered in the 
  motor vehicle accident of September 3, 1993. <br>
</p>
<p>[12] On September 25, 1995 the Board advised Sutor's solicitors that the benefits 
  paid and the costs incurred on her behalf totalled $53,203.99. This represented 
  $42,983.32 in benefits, $5,383.94 in medical costs, and $4,836.73 in administrative 
  expenses. The Board also forwarded two forms to Sutor, for her signature. One 
  of the forms, entitled &quot;Assignment&quot;, acknowledged the amount of her 
  total debt to the Board and assigned her right to that amount from any judgment 
  or settlement with the third party (Thurlow) to the Board. The form also acknowledged 
  that Sutor had received legal advice with respect to the terms of the assignment. 
  The second form, entitled &quot;Authorization and Direction&quot;, directed 
  her solicitors to pay the Board $53,203.99 from the proceeds of any settlement 
  or judgment.<br>
</p>
<p>[13] In its covering letter, the Board advised Sutor's solicitors that, in 
  order to preserve Sutor's rights to further compensation benefits, they should 
  get Board approval before any settlement. This was required by s. 10(3) of the 
  WCA, 1990.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] Sutor signed the two forms (the &quot;Assignment&quot; and the &quot;Authorization 
  and Direction&quot;) on October 12, 1995. Her solicitors returned the forms 
  to the Board on November 25, 1995, with a covering letter which concludes as 
  follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">We will of course contact your office for the Board's 
  approval prior to any settlement of Ms. Sutor's claim.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] The Board inquired of Sutor's solicitors about the status of her action 
  in September 1996, November 1996 and January 1997 and was advised in April 1997 
  that discoveries had been completed. On July 7, 1997, the Board again wrote 
  to Sutor's solicitors inquiring about the status of her private claim against 
  Thurlow. This went unanswered. Additional letters requesting the courtesy of 
  a reply were sent on November 17, 1997, March 5, 1998 and June 1, 1998. The 
  June 1, 1998 letter referred to the Law Society of Upper Canada in order to 
  prompt a reply.<br>
</p>
<p>[16] On June 16, 1998 Sutor's solicitors finally responded by letter. They 
  indicated that the action had been listed for trial and that they were waiting 
  for pre-trial and trial dates. They suggested that the delay was caused by the 
  defendant Thurlow taking the position that the accident had merely aggravated 
  Sutor's pre-accident work-related injuries. The letter also contained the following:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I am also reviewing the applicable provisions under 
  OMPP [Ontario Motorist Protection Plan] with respect to the Board's right of 
  subrogation. Specifically, subsection (5) of section 267 [Insurance Act] takes 
  away the right of the Board to recovery.<br>
</p>
<p>[17] Following another period of non-communication, the Board discovered that 
  settlement funds had been received by Sutor's solicitors. The Board then brought 
  an action against Sutor and her solicitors on November 30, 1999. This produced 
  a letter from Sutor's solicitors stating, amongst other things the following:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">1. We have not settled the Claim of our client, (Lynda 
  Sutor) for damages arising out of a motor vehicle accident in which she was 
  involved;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">2. We have received a settlement offer in the range 
  of $94,000.00 and the Defendant has forwarded settlement funds but same are 
  held in trust. Neither we, nor our client is entitled to these monies because 
  she has not provided us with instructions to accept the offer;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">3. The outstanding issue of the entitlement of WSIB 
  to repayment either by statute or contractually remains unresolved. We are of 
  the opinion that section 267(5) of the Insurance Act would prevent WSIB from 
  recovering this money. Your organization is of the opinion that notwithstanding 
  section 267(5) there is an obligation to repay;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">4. We have not and will not disburse these monies until 
  we are able to obtain settlement instructions and unless there is an agreement 
  with the organization or the matter has been settled by way of court application.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Further, we confirm your agreement to waive the filing 
  of the Defence at this time in order that we can discuss this matter further. 
  It is our intention, however, if this matter cannot be settled through discussions, 
  to bring an Application for the purpose of interpreting section 267(5) and any 
  contractual obligation which you allege requires our client to repay monies 
  to WSIB.<br>
</p>
<p>[18] The reference to &quot;contractual obligation&quot; is to the fact that, 
  in its action against Sutor and her solicitors, the Board alleged an agreement 
  between the Board and Sutor whereby she contracted to reimburse the Board.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] In the result, the Board's action was not prosecuted. The present proceeding 
  was brought on September 18, 2000 by way of application under rule 14.05. The 
  questions asked are:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(i) Did the Respondent, The Workplace Safety and Insurance 
  Board have the right to compel the Applicant to execute the Authorization, Direction 
  and Assignment which was in fact executed on October 12, 1995 as a pre-condition 
  of the Applicant's right to commence a civil action for damages arising out 
  of the motor vehicle accident which took place on September 3, 1993?;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) If the answer to question (i) is in the affirmative:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">a. Does s. 267(5) of the Insurance Act preclude the 
  Workplace Safety and Insurance Board from making a subrogated claim to a right 
  of recovery of the Applicant against the Respondent, Jeffery Thurlow, in respect 
  of a payment of benefit paid by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board to 
  the Applicant or in respect of a liability to make such payment or benefit?;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">b. If so, does the insistence by the Workplace Safety and Insurance 
  Board that the Applicant execute an Authorization and a Direction and Assignment 
  as referred to herein in order to commence a civil action, amount to economic 
  duress?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) If the answer to questions (ii) a. &amp; b. are 
  answered in the negative, does the Respondent, The Workplace Safety and Insurance 
  Board have the right to control or direct the litigation as between the Applicant, 
  Lynda Sutor and the Respondent, Jeffery Thurlow?<br>
</p>
<p>LAW<br>
</p>
<p>[20] These questions involve the relationship between s. 10 of the WCA, 1990 
  and s. 267 of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990 c. I-8. Section 10(4) of the WCA, 
  1990 conferred upon the Board a clear and unambiguous right of subrogation. 
  On the facts of the accident involving Sutor and Thurlow, if the Board paid 
  compensation benefits to Sutor, the Board could have sued Thurlow in Sutor's 
  name to assert her cause of action against him and in so doing recover, or attempt 
  to recover, the funds paid by the Board to Sutor or on her behalf.<br>
</p>
<p>[21] In 1990, as part of the Ontario Motorist Protection Plan (O.M.P.P.) the 
  Insurance Law Amendment Act, 1990 S.O. c. 2, s. 57, amended what became s. 267 
  of the Insurance Act. Section 267 currently reads as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">267. (1) The damages awarded to a person in a proceeding 
  for loss or damage arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation 
  of an automobile shall be reduced by,<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(a) all payments that the person has received or that 
  were or are available for no-fault benefits and by the present value of any 
  no-fault benefits to which he or she is entitled;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(b) all payments that the person has received under 
  any medical, surgical, dental, hospitalization, rehabilitation or long-term 
  care plan or law and by the present value of such payments to which he or she 
  is entitled;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(c) all payments that the person has received or that 
  were or are available for loss of income under the laws of any jurisdiction 
  or under an income continuation benefit plan and by the present value of any 
  such payments to which he or she is entitled; and<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(d) all payments that the person has received under 
  a sick leave plan arising by reason of the person's occupation or employment.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Payments or benefits received or that were, are 
  or may become available to a person under the Workplace Safety and Insurance 
  Act, 1997, shall not be applied under subsection </p>
<p class="indent">(1) to reduce the damages awarded.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(3) A reduction made under subsection (1) does not apply 
  for the purpose of determining a person's entitlement to compensation under 
  subsection 30(14) of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(4) A person who has made a payment or who has a liability 
  to pay a benefit described in clause (1)(a), (b), (c) or (d) is not subrogated 
  to a right of recovery of the insured against another person in respect of that 
  payment or benefit.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(5) The Workplace Safety and Insurance Board is not 
  subrogated to a right of recovery of the insured against another person in respect 
  of a payment or benefit paid by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board to 
  the insured or in respect of a liability to make such payment or benefit.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(6) This section applies to damages awarded for loss 
  or damage arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation, after the 
  23rd day of October, 1989 and before January 1, 1994, of an automobile. [Emphasis 
  added.]<br>
</p>
<p>[22] Section 267, as amended, was intended to reduce the cost of motor vehicle 
  insurance by reducing double recovery of collateral benefits by persons injured 
  in motor vehicle accidents. Workers' compensation benefits, however, were not 
  treated as collateral benefits. Instead, the Board's right of subrogation was 
  taken away by s. 267(5).<br>
</p>
<p>[23] This regime was enacted in 1990 and made retroactive to October 23, 1989. 
  Sutor's accident occurred after that date and, as a consequence, when the Board 
  paid compensation benefits to her it could not turn around and recover those 
  payments by suing Thurlow in Sutor's name.<br>
</p>
<p>[24] There is nothing before the court to indicate that, when the amendments 
  to s. 267 of the Insurance Act were passed, any attempt was made to reconcile 
  this situation with s. 10(4) of the WCA, 1990.<br>
</p>
<p>[25] In Cohen et al v. Smith (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 85 Borins J. reconciled the 
  conflict between s. 267(5) of the Insurance Act and s. 10(4) of the WCA, 1990 
  as follows, at pp. 89 and 90:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, it can be resolved by the application of 
  the maxim generalibus specialia derogant ? general words in legislation are 
  intended to give way to the particular.<br>
</p>
<p>In other words, the provisions of the special statute, the Insurance Act, provide 
  an exception to the general statute, the WCA, 1990.<br>
</p>
<p>[26] An appeal from Borins J. to the Divisional Court was dismissed (1996), 
  25 O.R. (3d) 264. Van Camp J., speaking for the court, adopted the reasoning 
  of Borins J., and in the course of doing so she said, at p. 269:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The purpose of the [Insurance] Act was to remove the 
  double recovery when collateral benefits were received and to remove the right 
  of subrogation for the person paying the benefits.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">There is no double recovery under the Workers' Compensation 
  Act. If the worker elects to claim benefits under the Act, all his rights in 
  respect of the injury are subrogated. If he elects to sue in tort he receives 
  no benefits under the Act. Counsel agreed that at times when the Board has chosen 
  not to sue, the Board has permitted a worker to re-elect on terms that benefits 
  he has received be repaid. In that case s. 267(2) removes the prejudice to him 
  in his action by reason of benefits having been received or becoming available 
  under the Workers' Compensation Act. [Emphasis added.]<br>
</p>
<p>Leave to appeal from the Divisional Court was refused: 60 A.C.W.S. (3d) 833 
  (C.A.).<br>
</p>
<p>[27] In Lozo v. Parish (1996), 36 C.C.L.I. (2d) 61, Parish, on February 15, 
  1990, was driving a tractor trailer and struck and injured Lozo, an employee 
  of the Ministry of Transportation, who was operating a snowplow. The Ministry 
  is a Schedule 2 employer. Schedule 2 employers pay the wage and medical expenses 
  of their employees and in turn are subrogated to the rights of those employees 
  to sue third parties. Lozo elected to take workers' compensation benefits when 
  advised that if he did so, the Ministry, in his name, would sue Parish.<br>
</p>
<p>[28] A year later the Ministry wrote to say that the law had been changed and 
  it could no longer sue. Lozo's lawyer then proposed that Lozo repay the Ministry 
  all benefits received. The Board accepted this proposal and Lozo agreed to pay 
  back $93,899.56 in benefits. <br>
</p>
<p>[29] Lozo then sued Parish for damages. Parish applied to the Workers' Compensation 
  Appeal Tribunal (&quot;WCAT&quot;)seeking a declaration that Lozo's change of 
  election was invalid because it violated the provisions of the amended Insurance 
  Act, among other arguments. On March 24, 1995 the WCAT denied the application 
  brought by the defendant. The reasons of the WCAT are taken from [1995] O.W.C.A.T.D. 
  No. 588; 35 W.C.A.T.R. 195; Decision No. 145 and read in part as follows: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">1) that W.C.A.T. did not have jurisdiction to enforce 
  the provisions of the Insurance Act so as to limit the right of action of the 
  plaintiff;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">2) that the re-election by the plaintiff to pursue a 
  lawsuit rather than to continue to claim benefits was not one that he was precluded 
  from entering into pursuant to s. 18 of the Workers' Compensation Act [s. 18 
  prohibits a worker from contracting out of or waiving any benefits under the 
  WCA, 1990];<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">3) that there were no grounds for setting aside the 
  re-election;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">4) that the right of action was not barred or limited 
  by the provisions of Part 1 of the Workers' Compensation Act; . . .<br>
</p>
<p>[30] Parish then moved before the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) 
  for rulings as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">1. Is the claim for past loss of income and benefits 
  prohibited by ss. 267(4) and (5) of the Insurance Act and, if so, is the plaintiff's 
  claim limited to claims for damages in excess of what has been paid by the Schedule 
  2 employer, the Ministry of Transportation?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">2. Is the claim for past loss of income and benefits 
  advanced by the plaintiff pursuant to his agreement with the Ministry a form 
  of subrogation?<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">3. Should this Court frustrate the decision of the Workers' 
  Compensation Appeal Tribunal?<br>
</p>
<p>[31] McKinnon J. ruled against Parish on the first question stating, at p. 
  69, that:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, the clear wording of Section 267(2) and 
  the observations of Van Camp, J. [in Cohen v. Smith] clearly contemplate the 
  present situation. Section 267(2) specifically provides in mandatory language 
  that payments or benefits received shall not be applied to reduce the damages 
  awarded, which is exactly what the defendant seeks to do in the present motion.<br>
</p>
<p>[32] McKinnon J. dealt with the subrogation argument at p. 69:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The defendant argues that the agreement entered into 
  by the plaintiff and the Ministry amounts to a form of subrogation. Black's 
  Law Dictionary defines subrogation as the &quot;substitution of one person in 
  the place of another with reference to a lawful claim, demand or right, so that 
  he who is substituted succeeds to the rights of the other in relation to the 
  debt or claim, and its rights, remedies or securities.&quot; Further, it is 
  &quot;the right of one who has paid an obligation which another should have 
  paid to be indemnified by the other.&quot; (6th edition, West Publishing Co., 
  St. Paul, Minnesota, 1990) <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Fundamental to the notion of subrogation is the right 
  to receive the benefit of all rights and remedies of the insured as against 
  third parties, which, if satisfied, will extinguish or diminish the ultimate 
  loss sustained: See Castellain v. Preston (1883), 11 Q.B.D. 380. <br>
</p>
<p class="center">. . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">At p. 70, he wrote:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, the agreement between the Ministry and the 
  plaintiff does not amount to subrogation. A mere agreement to re-pay benefits 
  paid in circumstances where the plaintiff individually is suing a third party 
  for damages greatly in excess of amounts which have been paid cannot be regarded 
  as subrogation. The Schedule 2 employer is not standing in the shoes of the 
  plaintiff by virtue of the agreement. The plaintiff brings this action in his 
  own right, and is seeking damages beyond the scope of the agreement. In the 
  present case, there exists a private agreement, specifically contemplated by 
  the provisions of Section 267(2) of the Insurance Act. Even if it could be categorized 
  as a form of subrogation, then I find that it is a form of subrogation specifically 
  permitted by Section 267(2) of the Act. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The doctrine of subrogation is a creature of equity, 
  not contract: See National Fire Insurance Co. v. McLaren (1886), 12 O.R. 682 
  (H.C.). Mr. Mair [counsel for Parish] argued that a failure to reduce damages 
  by the amounts already paid would be contrary to the spirit of the Osborne Report 
  and to the spirit of the decision in Ratych v. Bloomer, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 940. 
  I do not accept this argument. We are not dealing here with double recovery, 
  which was the main source of concern addressed by Osborne, J. and by Madam Justice 
  McLachlin in Ratych v. Bloomer. We are dealing with an agreement to re-pay monies 
  already paid by the Ministry of Transportation upon the assumption that the 
  tortfeasor shall have to pay the plaintiff. I see no objection to this result. 
  Indeed, I view the result to be equitable in all the circumstances. Implicitly, 
  the Divisional Court in Cohen v. Smith came to the same conclusion. <br>
</p>
<p>The Decision Below<br>
</p>
<p>[33] The application judge began his reasons as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">This is an application for the opinion, advice and direction 
  of the Court regarding a difference of opinion between the applicant and the 
  Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) over the claim to entitlement by 
  the WSIB to part of the proceeds of a motor vehicle settlement in favour of 
  the applicant.<br>
  In my view, that statement mischaracterizes the issue. The issue is between 
  the Board and Sutor and whether Sutor will repay the benefits paid to her by 
  the Board. There is no issue as between the Board and Thurlow.<br>
</p>
<p>[34] After dealing with Cohen v. Smith, the application judge ruled as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">What does all of this have to do with a private agreement 
  between the WSIB and Ms. Sutor? I am aware of the decision of the Workers' Compensation 
  Appeal Tribunal, [in Lozo v. Parish] referred to with approval in: Lozo v. Parish 
  [1996] O.J. No. 1371. In that case, the WCB had permitted a re-election, with 
  a similar agreement to reimburse the WCB for benefits paid. However, the attack 
  in that case was brought by the defendant in the lawsuit, rather than the WCB 
  claimant, and was directed against the re-election, rather than against the 
  assignment and direction. Therefore the Tribunal and the Court did not receive, 
  and did not have to consider the issues brought before this Court. Here, the 
  re-election is not in issue. What is squarely before the Court is the authority 
  of the WCB to take the assignment and direction, despite the changes, supra, 
  in the legislation. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, the principle in question in this part of 
  the discussion was put most succinctly and forcefully by Duff C.J. in Lower 
  Mainland Dairy Products Board v. Turner's Dairy Ltd., [1941] S.C.R. 573 at 577, 
  where he said: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent15">Such an administrative body as the Board in exercising its 
  statutory powers - powers affecting the rights and interests of private individuals 
  - is under an obligation not only to observe the limits of its powers and to 
  act conformably to the procedures laid down; it is under a strict duty to use 
  its powers in good faith for the purposes for which they are given.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">See also Communities Economic Development Fund v. Maxwell 
  et al, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 388, and the cases therein cited. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Here, the WCB officials knew, or certainly ought to 
  have known, that by s. 267(5) of the Insurance Act, the WCB had lost its previous 
  right to claim against third parties for benefits paid out re automobile accidents, 
  as part of the wide-ranging changes brought in by the O.M.P.P. re motor vehicle 
  accident claims. The legislation had put recovery of the benefits paid out to 
  her beyond the reach of the WCB, as a part of the broad policy of the Ontario 
  Government, that had created the WCB. Yet despite the specific legislation, 
  and the policy behind it, the WCB officials used forms that, while still acceptable 
  regarding other types of accidents, no longer were appropriate when, as here, 
  the application to withdraw the claim for WCB benefits was so that a lawsuit 
  for damages arising from a motor vehicle accident could be pursued. Built right 
  in to the withdrawal form was an agreement to reimburse the WCB, which the other 
  documents simply enlarged upon. Attached to the withdrawal form were excerpts 
  from the Workers Compensation Act, without any mention of s. 267(5) of the Insurance 
  Act. The whole impression created was that the WCB was entitled, as of right, 
  to be reimbursed. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, s. 267(5) of the Insurance Act precluded 
  the WCB from obtaining reimbursement directly from a third party. It cannot, 
  on the basis of the doctrine enunciated by Duff C.J., supra, do indirectly what 
  it could not do directly. Once the WCB was barred from suing a third party who 
  had injured its insured, the obligation of good faith, and to act conformably 
  to its powers, which had now been limited, prevents the WCB from suing its own 
  insured. The various documents obtained from Ms. Sutor cannot be relied upon 
  by the WCB to authorize the lawsuit, because the WCB lacked the power and authority 
  to even obtain them, much less compel their execution. [Emphasis added.]<br>
</p>
<p>[35] The application judge saw the Board in this case as doing indirectly what 
  it was prohibited from doing directly. I do not agree. The statement that the 
  &quot;legislation had put recovery of the benefits paid to her beyond the reach 
  of the WCB&quot; is incomplete and as such erroneous. What was put beyond the 
  reach of the Board was recovery from the third party, Thurlow. Always within 
  the reach of the Board, in the event of a re-election, was reimbursement directly 
  from the worker. This was not altered by the change in the legislation. Subrogation 
  or the taking away of a right to subrogate have nothing to do with what happened 
  here.<br>
</p>
<p>[36] I agree with McKinnon J.'s comments in Lozo as to the nature of subrogation 
  and his statement that &quot;the agreement between the Ministry and the plaintiff 
  does not amount to subrogation&quot;. The arrangement in issue is between Sutor 
  and the Board. It is designed to put Sutor back into a position where she can 
  re-elect and, instead of receiving the benefits provided for her by the WCA, 
  1990 through the Board, she will be able to prosecute an action against Thurlow 
  as she sees fit. The Board is not purporting to do indirectly what it is prohibited 
  from doing directly. Rather, it is permitting Sutor to take steps backward in 
  order that she may then move forward on her own against Thurlow.<br>
</p>
<p>[37] I do not understand the findings of the application judge that:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . . the WCB officials used forms that, while still 
  acceptable re other types of accidents, no longer were appropriate . . .<br>
</p>
<p>and<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Attached to the withdrawal form were excerpts from the 
  Workers' Compensation Act, without any mention of s. 267(5) of the Insurance 
  Act.<br>
</p>
<p>[38] The first document that Sutor saw respecting her rights was the election 
  form referred to in paragraph 5 of these reasons. This clearly and accurately 
  set out her rights, including the fact that the Board could not sue Thurlow. 
  Before she signed the election, she read the form and obtained legal advice. 
  The second document that she saw respecting her rights was the letter of October 
  21, 1993 from the Board, the contents of which are set out in paragraph 7 of 
  these reasons. Again, the document was entirely accurate and, again, she obtained 
  legal advice as suggested in the Board's letter. As such, Sutor could not possibly 
  have been in any doubt as to her rights or the Board's rights.<br>
</p>
<p>[39] The only form from the Board which might have been capable of misleading 
  Sutor was the back of the form entitled &quot;Withdrawal Claim for Workers' 
  Compensation Benefits&quot;. On the back of that form is the text of s. 8 of 
  the Act, now s. 10 as set out in paragraph 10 of these reasons. Section 8(4) 
  (s. 10(4) at the relevant time and s. 30(10) today) indicates that the Board, 
  on paying benefits to Sutor, would be subrogated to her right to sue Thurlow. 
  Sutor, of course, had already been advised by the election form, by the Board's 
  letter of October 21, 1993 and doubtless by her own solicitor, that the law 
  had been changed with respect to motor vehicle accidents and that the Board 
  could no longer sue Thurlow.<br>
</p>
<p>[40] Sutor did not sign the withdrawal form until August 1995. There is no 
  evidence that she read the back of the form, then or ever, and there is no suggestion 
  in her affidavit, sworn September 14, 2000 that she misunderstood or was misled 
  respecting either her rights or the Board's. Accordingly, I see no evidentiary 
  basis for the findings of the application judge respecting the actions of the 
  Board.<br>
</p>
<p>[41] The Board did precisely what was contemplated by s. 10. It advised Sutor 
  that she could sue Thurlow or she could take the benefits offered by the Board 
  exercising the powers and duties given to it by the WCA, 1990. Implicit in the 
  legislative scheme and its administration by the Board is the proposition that 
  she could not do both. As stated by Van Camp J. in Cohen v. Smith, supra, at 
  p. 269: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">There is no double recovery under the Workers' Compensation 
  Act. If the worker elects to claim benefits under the Act, all his rights are 
  subrogated. If he elects to sue in tort he receives no benefits under the Act. 
  Counsel agreed that at times when the Board has chosen not to sue, the Board 
  has permitted a worker to re-elect on terms that benefits he has received be 
  repaid.<br>
</p>
<p>[42] Likewise in Lozo v. Parish, McKinnon J. dealt with an identical situation 
  saying:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">We are not dealing here with double recovery, which 
  was the main source of concern addressed by Osborne, J. and by Madam Justice 
  McLachlin in Bloomer v. Ratych. We are dealing with an agreement to re-pay monies 
  already paid by the Ministry of Transportation upon the assumption that the 
  tortfeasor shall have to pay the plaintiff. I see no objection to this result. 
  Indeed, I view the result to be equitable in all the circumstances. Implicitly, 
  the Divisional Court in Cohen v. Smith came to the same conclusion.<br>
</p>
<p>I agree completely with these analyses. If a worker elects to sue in tort he 
  is not entitled to receive benefits under the Act. Accordingly, if a worker, 
  having first elected to take compensation benefits, changes his/her mind, before 
  s/he can sue the tortfeasor, the worker should first put himself or herself 
  back in the condition of having received no benefits from the Board.<br>
</p>
<p>[43] It has been a fundamental principle of workers' compensation in Ontario 
  since January 1, 1915 that a worker covered by the legislation who is injured 
  in circumstances giving rise to a cause of action has a choice. The worker can 
  claim the benefits provided by the legislation or s/he can sue. The language 
  of S.O. 1914, c. 25 s. 9(1), &quot;may claim such benefits or may bring such 
  action&quot; is carried forward in s. 10(1) of WCA, 1990. There is no suggestion 
  that an injured worker may do both. Such a suggestion would be entirely at odds 
  with the principle of choice expressed in s. 10(1).<br>
</p>
<p>[44] As to re-election, the situation is accurately stated by Ison, Terence 
  G., LL.D. in Workers' Compensation in Canada (Butterworths) 2nd ed., 1989, at 
  p. 172, s. 8.1.21:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Revocation of Election<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In jurisdictions in which a worker must elect between 
  compensation benefits or a civil action, the Acts do not provide for the revocation 
  of such an election by a worker, but in practice, revocation is often allowed.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Conversely, if a worker has claimed compensation benefits 
  and then wishes to pursue a civil action without participation by the Board, 
  he might be allowed to revoke the election by repaying the compensation or by 
  making some provision for its repayment.<br>
</p>
<p>[45] I am not persuaded that by cancelling the right of subrogation in the 
  case of persons at work injured in motor vehicle accidents, the Legislature 
  intended to vary this fundamental principle of workers' compensation benefits 
  in Ontario or to provide a means to secure double recovery in a substantial 
  number of work related claims. Had that been the intention of the government 
  in 1990, surely it would have so advised the Legislature when the amendments 
  to s. 267 were introduced. The impact upon the administration of the workers' 
  compensation scheme would have been very substantial.<br>
</p>
<p>[46] According to this court in Meyer v. Bright (1994), 15 O.R. (3d) 129 (C.A.) 
  at p. 134:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The legislation [the amendments to s. 267] appears designed 
  to control the costs of automobile insurance premiums to the consumer by eliminating 
  some tort claims.<br>
</p>
<p>If &quot;control&quot; in this context means &quot;hold down&quot; or &quot;reduce&quot;, 
  then the result as determined by the application judge would have been counter-productive. 
  What that result leads to is double recovery.<br>
</p>
<p>[47] Nor am I persuaded that the Legislature, by enacting s. 267 of the Insurance 
  Act, intended to divide injured workers into two classes, namely, those workers 
  injured in motor vehicle cases who can re-elect without being required to reimburse 
  and those injured in non-motor vehicle cases who can only re-elect on promising 
  to reimburse the Board. No rationale for such a distinction has been suggested.<br>
</p>
<p>[48] It may be argued that double recovery has been avoided in this case and 
  can be avoided in others by clarification of the precise matters being compensated. 
  For instance, it is suggested that the Board compensated Sutor for her loss 
  of earnings and that there is nothing designated in the $94,000 in her solicitor's 
  trust account that fits that head of damage and that accordingly there is no 
  overlap or double recovery. That argument ignores the fact that workers' compensation 
  benefits do not relate solely to loss of earnings. In any event, that is not 
  what the legislation provides. If the worker elects to take compensation, s. 
  10(4) of the WCA, 1990 (now s. 30(10) of the Workplace Safety and Insurance 
  Act, 1997) provides that the Board (or the employer in the case of Schedule 
  2 employers) is subrogated to all the rights of the worker in respect of the 
  injury and the Board may sue and prosecute an action in the name of the worker. 
  The action is in the name of the worker but the Board controls and directs the 
  litigation. The Board is dominus litis. Even if an action is brought by the 
  worker in his own name, judgment should go payable to the Board: Toronto Railway 
  Co. v. Hutton (1919), 59 S.C.R. 413, MacIntosh v. Gzowski (1979), 27 O.R. (2d) 
  151 (C.A.). The underlying principles of the workers' compensation scheme were 
  not changed by the amendments to the Insurance Act.<br>
</p>
<p>[49] Nor, in my view, is this a case of the Board doing indirectly what it 
  cannot do directly. It is rather a case of the Board properly exercising the 
  duties and responsibilities placed upon it by its governing legislation. That 
  legislation gave Sutor, in the circumstances, a choice of suing Thurlow or taking 
  compensation. She chose the latter, with legal advice. She enjoyed the benefits 
  of that choice for several years. Those benefits included payments to her of 
  about $918 per week on account of earnings, as well as rehabilitation services, 
  aptitude testing and medical expenses. A total of $53,203.99 was spent on her 
  behalf, including a lump sum payment for a permanent partial disability.<br>
</p>
<p>[50] After several years, and again with legal advice, Sutor decided to reverse 
  her position and to sue Thurlow. To allow her to do so, the Board required her 
  to undertake to reimburse the Board. This was not a requirement unique to Sutor. 
  In Lozo, with the advice of his employer, Lozo volunteered to reimburse the 
  Board. Reimbursement on its face does not strike one as radical or unfair in 
  the circumstances. From the worker's perspective it seems only fair and appropriate. 
  The WCA, 1990 renders it so because if the worker sues and recovers less than 
  the benefits to which the worker would have been entitled under the WCA, 1990, 
  then the Board is bound by s. 10(2) to make up the difference. Likewise, the 
  requirement by the Board for reimbursement by a re-electing worker strikes one 
  as proper and careful administration of funds paid by employers under compulsion 
  of law.<br>
</p>
<p>[51] If the application judge's view of the law is correct, it would follow 
  that the Board would be strongly disinclined to accept re-election. The more 
  the Board had paid out, the more disinclined it would be. There are circumstances 
  where re-election is or can be beneficial to an injured worker. Lozo is but 
  one example and the Supreme Court of Canada has recognized the right of the 
  Board [or in the case of a schedule 2 employer, the right of the employer.] 
  to permit re-election: Toronto Railway Co. v. Hutton, supra per Duff J. at p. 
  421. These circumstances assist me in arriving at the conclusion that the application 
  judge erred.<br>
</p>
<p>[52] The application judge went on to discuss common law subrogation in order 
  to deal with the position taken by the Board in its action against Sutor and 
  her solicitors that she had entered into a contract with the Board to reimburse 
  it. The application judge dismissed this claim upon the basis that, at common 
  law, no right of subrogation arises until the injured party's loss has been 
  fully satisfied and here, on the evidence, there was nothing in her recovery 
  for loss of earnings. As a consequence, there would at common law be no right 
  to subrogate. As stated above, this in my opinion is not a matter of subrogation 
  and accordingly, the strictures of common law subrogation have no application.<br>
</p>
<p>Jurisdiction<br>
</p>
<p>[53] It was argued before the application judge that the Board lacked the authority 
  to require Sutor to pay back the benefits paid to her or on her behalf as a 
  condition of allowing her to re-elect and pursue her private claim. It was argued 
  that as there was no express statutory authority to enter into such an arrangement 
  it was ultra vires. Reliance was placed on City of London v. Gibbons (1989) 
  69 O.R. (2d) 389 (Dist. Ct.). The application judge found, however, that the 
  Board had the capacity and powers of a natural person and as such was able to 
  enter into the reimbursement arrangement. I agree with this conclusion, failing 
  which the Board would be severely handicapped in circumstances in which it might 
  wish to permit a claimant to re-elect and bring his or her own action. The jurisdiction 
  argument was not pursued in this court and need not be considered further.<br>
</p>
<p>DISPOSITION<br>
</p>
<p>[54] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and set aside the order below. In 
  its place I would make an order that question (i): </p>
<p class="indent">Did the Respondent, The Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, 
  have the right to compel the Applicant to execute the Authorization, Direction 
  and Assignment which was in fact executed on October 12, 1995 as a pre-condition 
  of the Applicant's right to commence a civil action for damages arising out 
  of the motor vehicle accident which took place on September 3, 1993?;</p>
<p>be answered in the affirmative, and</p>
<p class="indent">question (ii) a. Does s. 267(5) of the Insurance Act preclude 
  the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board from making a subrogated claim to a 
  right of recovery of the Applicant against the Respondent, Jeffrey Thurlow, 
  in respect of a payment of benefit paid by the Workplace Safety and Insurance 
  Board to the Applicant or in respect of a liability to make such payment or 
  benefit?;<br>
</p>
<p>be answered in the affirmative, and<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">question (ii) b If so, does the insistence by the Workplace 
  Safety and Insurance Board that the Applicant execute an Authorization and a 
  Direction and Assignment as referred to herein in order to commence a civil 
  action, amount to economic duress?<br>
</p>
<p>be answered in the negative, and<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">question (iii) If the answer to questions (ii) a. &amp; b. are 
  answered in the negative, does the Respondent, the Workplace Safety and Insurance 
  Board, have the right to control or direct the litigation as between the Applicant, 
  Lynda Sutor and the Respondent, Jeffrey Thurlow?<br>
</p>
<p>be answered in the negative.<br>
</p>
<p>Costs<br>
</p>
<p>[55] The application judge's view was that the legislation plainly disentitled 
  the Board and, as a result, Sutor was entitled to her costs on a &quot;full 
  indemnity scale&quot;. He fixed them at $11,635 for fees and GST of $814.45 
  plus disbursements of $890.41 for a total of $13,339.86. <br>
</p>
<p>[56] As to Thurlow, the application judge disagreed with the argument of the 
  Board that Thurlow should not receive costs because he was not directly affected 
  and should not have taken part. The application judge held that the position 
  of the Board in the action which it started was to attack the settlement worked 
  out between Thurlow and Sutor and, in any event, Thurlow took full part in the 
  argument before the application judge and was of assistance to the court. Thurlow 
  was therefore awarded partial indemnity costs of $5073 for fees and GST of $355.11 
  for a total of $5428.11.<br>

<p>Whether this claim is on a substantial or partial indemnity basis is not clear.<br>
</p>
<p>Thurlow seeks $7359.00 for fees and $584.18 for disbursements on a partial 
  indemnity basis. He does not mention GST.<br>
</p>
  <p>[58] Having succeeded, the Board is entitled to its costs here and below against 
  Sutor on a partial indemnity basis. I would fix them at $10,000 here and $7500 
  below. Thurlow appears to have been drawn into this proceeding by reason of 
  mischaracterization. He is entitled to his costs against Sutor on a partial 
  indemnity basis. I would fix them at $5428.11 below and $7000 here.<br>
