<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice B. Thomas Granger of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 13, 2001.</p>

<p>
  FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] While married, the parties separated twice. Following their first separation, 
  they entered into a separation agreement and carried out the property arrangements 
  it mandated. However, for three years thereafter, they continued a relationship 
  with each other, the nature of which is the subject of dispute in this action, 
  before they decided to terminate that relationship and obtain a divorce. Unfortunately, 
  they were not able to come to a resolution of their financial affairs and obligations 
  to each other following the divorce.</p>
<p>
  [2] There were two issues for trial: whether the parties had reconciled in June 
  1996 after their first separation in October 1995; and, if so, what was the 
  effect of that reconciliation on the separation agreement of February 1996, 
  and on whether there should be an equalization payment under the Family Law 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3. For the purpose of trial, the parties agreed on a 
  joint Net Family Property Statement (&quot;NFPS&quot;), subject to disagreement 
  on the ownership and proper treatment of the following three pieces of property: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) the husband sought to exclude support payments to his first 
  wife out of his pension;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) the wife claimed that mutual funds registered in her name 
  and her daughter's were in fact solely her daughter's property and thus should 
  not be included in her assets; and</p>
<p class="indent">(3) the husband wanted to exclude his 1998 Toyota motor vehicle 
  with a value of $45,000 on the basis that he purchased it with money given to 
  him as a gift from his mother.</p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge found that the parties had reconciled in February 1998, 
  not in June 1996. He found that the reconciliation vitiated the separation agreement 
  from the date of reconciliation onwards, but did not have the effect of setting 
  aside the releases or the transactions carried out under the agreement. He went 
  on to hold that because the parties did not acquire any assets after the reconciliation 
  date, there was nothing to equalize, and consequently, he ordered no equalization 
  payment. The wife appeals from that order.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant wife and the respondent husband were married on July 2, 1992. 
  It was the wife's third marriage and the husband's second. They entered into 
  a marriage contract on July 10, 1992, in anticipation of the purchase of their 
  home at 2199 Edgemore Avenue in Windsor on July 24, 1992. The marriage contract 
  acknowledged that the home was being purchased for $229,000, that the wife was 
  contributing $106,000 and that the husband was providing $73,000 and was taking 
  sole responsibility for a $50,000 mortgage. They agreed that if the marriage 
  broke down, they would each be entitled to their respective financial contributions 
  and that they would split equally any equity in the house created by the partial 
  or full retirement of any mortgage or any increase in the market value of the 
  property. They made the same agreement in respect of any new matrimonial home 
  they might buy, and provided that the cash contributions to the home purchase(s) 
  would not be considered as part of their net family property.</p>
<p>
  [5] The parties separated on October 29, 1995, but continued to live in the 
  same house together. On February 29, 1996, they entered into a separation agreement 
  that provided for the disposition of their respective interests in the Edgemore 
  house and its contents, and for no support of the wife by the husband. Under 
  the agreement, the husband paid the wife $115,000 for her interest in the Edgemore 
  house and they divided the furniture between them. Paragraph 2 deals with the 
  agreement regarding the Edgemore matrimonial home: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The parties agree that upon execution of this agreement the wife shall forthwith 
  transfer to her husband all of her right, title and interest in the matrimonial 
  home at 2199 Edgemore Avenue, La Salle, Ontario upon receiving the sum of $115,000.00 
  (One Hundred and Fifteen Thousand Dollars and no cents) from the said Husband. 
  Such transfer shall be subject to all encumbrances. From and after the date 
  of such transfer, the Wife shall have no further interest in the matrimonial 
  home under the provisions of The Family Law Act.</p>
<p>
  [6] Paragraph 7 of the separation agreement is entitled &quot;Agreement Conclusive&quot; 
  and provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This Agreement shall be final and conclusive with respect to all issues arising 
  from the marital status of the parties. If either party shall take legal proceedings 
  against the other with respect to the property rights of either party, or the 
  alimony, support or maintenance obligations between the parties, except as expressly 
  provided for in this Agreement or to enforce its terms, this Agreement may be 
  pleaded as full estoppel and defence to any such claim made by the Husband or 
  the Wife against the other, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
  this provision shall apply to any claims made pursuant to the Divorce Act, the 
  Family Relations Act/Family Law Act or any other statute which exists or may 
  exist in the future relating to property rights or alimony and maintenance obligations.</p>
<p>
  [7] The wife used the funds she received to purchase another house at 1391 Ramblewood 
  Drive in the spring of 1996. The husband maintained ownership of 2199 Edgemore 
  until he sold it in February 1998. He lived at both addresses from 1996 until 
  February 1998, when he began to live exclusively at Ramblewood, where he remained 
  until November 1998. He later bought a house on Northwood Street.</p>
<p>
  [8] The wife commenced divorce proceedings in October 1999, claiming November 
  1998 as the date of separation. The divorce was undefended by the husband and 
  was granted in December 1999. The trial in this action was held to determine 
  the wife's claim for equalization.</p>
<p>
  [9] The underlying issue at the trial was whether the parties had ever reconciled 
  following their first separation in October 1995. The wife's position was that 
  they reconciled in June 1996, from which time they travelled together, had sexual 
  relations and lived as a couple at her Ramblewood residence, even though the 
  husband also maintained the Edgemore home. The husband's position was that they 
  remained friends but never reconciled into a full husband and wife commitment.</p>
<p>
  [10] The trial judge found that until the husband sold Edgemore and moved fully 
  into Ramblewood in February 1998, they had not reconciled in accordance with 
  the tests set out in the case law: Cooper v. Cooper (1972), 10 R.F.L. 184 (Ont. 
  H.C.); Re Buller and Buller (1979), 26 O.R. (2d) 92 (Co. Ct.). However, once 
  the husband sold his property and moved into the wife's residence, they then 
  had the mutual intention to reconcile and resume their marriage.</p>
<p>
  [11] Unfortunately, from that point in time the reconciliation period was brief. 
  The wife began a relationship with another man in June 1998, causing the trial 
  judge to conclude that from that date, she was no longer committed to the reconciliation, 
  although she did not tell the husband that the relationship was over until the 
  following October, when she asked him to move out. As a result, the trial judge 
  determined that &quot;the parties reconciled as of the end of February, 1998 
  and separated as of October, 1998&quot;.</p>
<p>
  THE TRIAL JUDGE'S FINDINGS ON EQUALIZATION</p>
<p>
  [12] The trial judge found that upon reconciliation, the separation agreement 
  was no longer in effect in respect of the undertaking to live separate and apart; 
  however, the division of property and the mutual release of claims against such 
  property had no temporal limitation and remained valid and binding. With respect 
  to Ramblewood, the trial judge added that the parties knew when they entered 
  into the separation agreement that the wife intended to use the funds she received 
  from her share of Edgemore to acquire Ramblewood; therefore they must have intended 
  that it would be her sole property and would not be subject to equalization 
  even though it became the matrimonial home. He went on to conclude: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Accordingly, the only property which is to be included in the net family property 
  of the parties is the value of any property acquired between the end of February, 
  1998 and the end of September 1998&#133;There was no evidence adduced by either 
  party that they had accumulated any additional property or wealth during this 
  period of time.</p>
<p>
  Consequently, he awarded no equalization payment.</p>
<p>ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [13] The appellant wife submits the trial judge made the following errors: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) The trial judge erred in finding that the date of reconciliation 
  was in February 1998 rather than in the spring of 1996;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) The trial judge erred in finding that the division of property 
  under the separation agreement survived the reconciliation of the parties;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) No matter what the date of reconciliation, once a finding 
  was made that the parties had reconciled, the trial judge was obliged to order 
  equalization based on the parties' agreed Net Family Property Statement, to 
  make the three factual determinations that the parties had left unresolved, 
  and to order an equalization payment to the wife based on the resulting figure.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (i) Whether the trial judge erred in his finding as to the date of reconciliation</p>
<p>
  [14] The appellant submits that the trial judge made findings of fact that supported 
  the position of the appellant that reconciliation had occurred in the spring 
  of 1996: the parties occupied the same bedroom in the Ramblewood home; they 
  had sexual relations from time to time; they had daily communications; they 
  performed domestic services for each other, in her case, cooking, laundry, house 
  cleaning and sick care; they ate together on a regular basis; and, together 
  they both attended and hosted numerous social functions. Consequently, the appellant's 
  position is that the finding that they had not made a mutual commitment to reconcile 
  until the husband was able to sell his house and move in with the wife in February 
  1998 was not based on any relevant change of circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [15] However, in assessing all of the evidence, the trial judge also considered 
  as relevant the fact that the husband showed his Edgemore address on his driver's 
  licence until February 1998 and that both parties described themselves as separated 
  in their tax returns for 1996 and 1997. The trial judge also referred to the 
  fact that the husband sold Edgemore without any participation by the wife, on 
  the basis that the parties continued to be bound by their separation agreement 
  and to live separate and apart, and that two secretaries from the husband's 
  workplace indicated that they would contact him in 1996 and 1997 at the Edgemore 
  house.</p>
<p>
  [16] An appellate court's role is not to reweigh or reassess the evidence, but 
  to defer to the trial judge on findings of fact or mixed fact and law, subject 
  to palpable and overriding error or errors of law: Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 
  2 S.C.R. 235.</p>
<p>
  [17] The trial judge was faced with an unusual and equivocal fact situation. 
  He considered the evidence in the context of the proper legal tests. Although 
  there was evidence that could indicate that the parties had reconciled as of 
  an earlier point in their post-separation relationship, the trial judge made 
  no palpable and overriding error in his finding that they did not reconcile 
  until February 1998. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (ii) The effect of the parties' reconciliation on the separation agreement</p>
<p>
  [18] Having found that the parties did reconcile, the trial judge had to determine 
  the effect of their reconciliation on the separation agreement. He further had 
  to decide, if an equalization payment were to be ordered, what property would 
  be included in the parties' net family property. For the purposes of trial the 
  parties had filed an agreed NFPS, which included all property they owned on 
  valuation day (November 1998) including the Ramblewood home that the wife purchased 
  using her proceeds from her interest in Edgemore, and the husband's Northwood 
  property that he purchased with his proceeds from the Edgemore home. The NFPS 
  deducted from each side the parties' original contributions to the Edgemore 
  home in accordance with the terms of their marriage contract. The NFPS also 
  contained many assets, including the husband's pension, that were not referred 
  to in the separation agreement. Both at trial and on appeal, counsel disagreed 
  on the effect and intent of their agreed NFPS.</p>
<p>
  [19] The trial judge first considered some case law pertaining to the effect 
  of reconciliation on a separation agreement. He referred to two cases decided 
  by this court under the original Family Law Reform Act 1978 (Ont.), c. 2: Bebenek 
  v. Bebenek (1979), 24 O.R. (2d) 385 (C.A.), and Bailey v. Bailey (1982), 37 
  O.R. (2d) 117 (C.A.). In Bebenek, the court restated the common law rule that 
  &quot;[t]he resumption of cohabitation terminates a separation agreement but 
  does not necessarily affect conveyances made pursuant to the agreement prior 
  to the reconciliation.&quot; The court is to discern the intention of the parties 
  from the language of the separation agreement according to Bebenek. In Bailey, 
  the court held that where the agreement does not contain a clause that addresses 
  the effect of reconciliation on the separation agreement, the issue whether 
  the parties intended that they would be precluded from &quot;attracting the 
  operation of the Family Law Reform Act just because the parties entered into 
  a separation agreement during the crisis period without contemplating the possibility 
  of reconciliation&quot; was a triable issue. The trial judge also referred to 
  Smart v. Wiewior (1990), 28 R.F.L. (3d) 225 (B.C.C.A.), where the British Columbia 
  Court of Appeal stated that the court is to determine whether the parties reached 
  either an express or implied agreement when they reconciled as to whether their 
  separation agreement was to survive or be considered void. The Manitoba Queen's 
  Bench case of Baron v. Baron (1990), 29 R.F.L. (3d) 37, is to a similar effect.</p>
<p>
  [20] The trial judge then referred to the clauses of the parties' separation 
  agreement, which did not include a specific clause addressing the effect of 
  reconciliation. He stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In this case, the parties did not include a clause or term in the Separation 
  Agreement setting out the effect that a reconciliation would have on the terms 
  of the Separation Agreement. Absent such a paragraph, the covenants that they 
  will, as husband and wife, live separate and apart will ordinarily terminate 
  as of the date of reconciliation, but such reconciliation does not necessarily 
  affect rights and obligations that have already accrued as expressed in the 
  agreement. In this case, the parties acknowledged in the Separation Agreement 
  that they had agreed upon a division of their property and that such division 
  was to be final and binding. The Separation Agreement did not state that upon 
  reconciliation or a resumption of cohabitation the agreement would be null and 
  void and that the division of their property as set out in the Separation Agreement 
  would no longer be effective. There was no temporal limitation on the division 
  of property and the mutual release of claims against such property or value. 
  As I have previously stated, there is no attack upon the validity of the Separation 
  Agreement dated February 29, 1996.</p>
<p> [21] He concluded that, &quot;[t]he parties, by executing the agreement on 
  February 29, 1996, forever released any claim they had to relief under the Family 
  Law Act against the property they had on that date&quot; (emphasis added).<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  I note, however, that the general release clause, article 7, of the separation 
  agreement quoted in para. 6, supra, does not limit the release to property the 
  parties had on the date of the agreement. In contrast, article 2, which deals 
  with the transfer of the Edgemore matrimonial home, provides that the wife shall 
  have no further interest in that property under the provisions of the Family 
  Law Act. The trial judge's finding that the parties intended Ramblewood to be 
  the sole property of the wife and not be subject to equalization under the Family 
  Law Act, as it was purchased with her share of the value of Edgemore, is consistent 
  with his interpretation of the effect of the release regarding Edgemore contained 
  in clause 2 of the separation agreement. The trial judge also referred to the 
  fact that the parties did not unwind the Edgemore transfer upon reconciliation 
  as evidence of their intent that the separation agreement was final and precluded 
  any equalization of property held at that time.</p>
<p>
  [22] In my respectful view, the trial judge erred in law in his approach to 
  this issue. The trial judge effectively required the parties to a separation 
  agreement to provide for what happens on reconciliation, failing which the finality 
  of the agreement would be taken as continuing. However, the common law rule 
  is to the opposite effect: the separation agreement is void upon reconciliation, 
  subject to a specific clause in the agreement that would override the common 
  law or a clause that would be implied from the agreement that the intent of 
  the parties was that transactions carried out under the agreement will remain 
  in place. </p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge used the general release clause to find that the intent 
  of the parties was that the property provisions of the separation agreement, 
  which were not limited to property the parties had on that date, would survive 
  reconciliation. However, I believe it would be fair to say that such a clause 
  would be found in virtually every professionally drawn separation agreement. 
  It does not, without more, indicate that the parties turned their minds to what 
  would occur if they were to reconcile. If the general release clause had that 
  effect, then the property provisions of virtually every separation agreement 
  would survive reconciliation without the need for a specific clause addressing 
  that eventuality.</p>
<p>
  [24] However, a specific release of all rights to a particular property can 
  be viewed as evidence that the parties considered the disposition of that property 
  final and binding, regardless of what may occur in the future. For example, 
  in Watson v. Watson (1988), 16 R.F.L. (3d) 457 (O.U.F.C.), a decision of Wallace 
  J., as in this case, the parties separated, entered into a separation agreement, 
  later reconciled, then eventually separated and divorced. Under the separation 
  agreement, the husband transferred the matrimonial home to the wife in exchange 
  for $8,000 in accordance with the following clause in the agreement: </p>
<p class="indent"> Matrimonial Property</p>
<p class="indent">The husband hereby conveys to the wife all his right, title 
  and interest in the lands and premises known municipally as 219 East 44th Street, 
  Hamilton, Ontario and quit claims any interest he may have therein, and in particular 
  under the provisions of the Family Law Act, provided that the wife shall pay 
  to the husband the sum of $8,000.00, immediately.</p>
<p>
  [25] Again, as in this case, the agreement contained no clause dealing expressly 
  with reconciliation. The trial judge, however, was able to conclude from the 
  property clause, together with the severability clause of the agreement, that 
  it was the intent of the parties that the transfer of the Hamilton property 
  would survive any reconciliation and, in that event, the husband would make 
  no claim for equalization of that property under the Family Law Act. Consequently, 
  she found that the Hamilton property was excluded property under s. 4(2)6 of 
  the Act, which excludes from net family property: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Property that the spouses have agreed by a domestic contract is not to be included 
  in the spouse's net family property.</p>
<p>
  [26] Following the Watson analysis, the trial judge in this case was entitled 
  to find that the transfer of the Edgemore matrimonial home to the husband and 
  the compensation paid to the wife for her share, were intended by the parties 
  to be final and binding, no matter what happened in the future, and no further 
  claim for equalization under the Family Law Act would be made in respect of 
  that property, as specifically provided in clause 2 of the agreement. The trial 
  judge found corroboration of the parties' intent from the fact that they never 
  attempted to set aside or reverse that transaction; rather, the husband maintained 
  Edgemore as his own property and used the proceeds to purchase Northwood, while 
  the wife used her proceeds to purchase Ramblewood. </p>
<p>
  [27] In my view, therefore, based on the terms of the separation agreement and 
  corroborated by the subsequent conduct of the parties, the trial judge was entitled 
  to find that they intended the disposition of the Edgemore home under the separation 
  agreement, which divided the value between them as of the separation date, to 
  be final and to survive reconciliation. However, there was no basis in the agreement 
  or the evidence to go further and find that the entire agreement was intended 
  to survive a reconciliation and continuation of the marriage.</p>
<p>
  [28] Based on his finding that the separation agreement was intended to survive 
  reconciliation with respect to then existing property, the trial judge held 
  that the only property to be included in the net family property of the parties 
  for equalization under the Family Law Act was property held on valuation day 
  and acquired after reconciliation. As a result, he gave no effect to the NFPS 
  that had been agreed to by the parties, nor did he include for the purpose of 
  equalization any property acquired between the date of the separation agreement 
  (February 1996) and the date of reconciliation (February 1998) and held on valuation 
  day.</p>
<p>
  (iii) The effect of the agreed upon NFPS </p>
<p>
  [29] On the appeal, counsel diverged on the effect of the agreed NFPS that they 
  filed in the proceedings before the trial judge. As a result, this court asked 
  for copies of the opening statements and the written submissions of counsel 
  to the trial judge, and counsel were good enough to provide those following 
  the hearing.</p>
<p>
  [30] From a review of all those submissions, it appears that both counsel intended 
  and understood that the NFPS would be used for the purpose of calculating the 
  equalization payment in the event that the trial judge found that the parties 
  reconciled and that the effect of the reconciliation was to set aside the separation 
  agreement in its entirety. In the NFPS, the parties agreed on the assets and 
  the values for the assets, subject to disagreement on the treatment of three 
  assets outlined in para. 2 supra.</p>
<p>
  [31] The wife's approach was that once reconciliation was found, there would 
  be equalization in accordance with the agreed NFPS. </p>
<p>
  [32] The husband's approach was that if the trial judge found reconciliation, 
  there remained the issue of the status of the separation agreement. He submitted 
  that he should have a credit in the agreed NFPS to reflect the Edgemore transaction 
  carried out under the separation agreement. This submission confirms that it 
  was not the husband's intention that the entire property division under the 
  separation agreement would survive reconciliation, but only that the division 
  of Edgemore represented a final division of the parties' investment in their 
  original matrimonial home.</p>
<p>
  [33] Because of my conclusion that the parties' interests in the Edgemore property 
  cannot be the subject of further equalization, but that any other property they 
  owned on valuation day is to be included, I agree with the theory of the husband's 
  submission to the trial judge, although not with his suggested revision to the 
  agreed NFPS. </p>
<p>
  [34] In my view, the best way to use the agreed NFPS is to remove both the inclusion 
  of the Ramblewood and Northwood properties as well as the deductions for the 
  parties' original contributions to purchase Edgemore. That effectively removes 
  from both sides their respective investments in Edgemore.</p>
<p>
  [35] The trial judge made a finding that the husband's new vehicle was substantially 
  purchased with a gift of funds from his mother. That was the third of the outstanding 
  issues. However, he did not determine the other two issues. Therefore, in order 
  to </p>
<p>complete the NFPS and determine a figure to be paid for equalization, unless 
  the parties can agree, a new trial on those narrow issues will be required.</p>
<p>
  RESULT</p>
<p>
  [36] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the trial judge, and substitute 
  an order that there will be an equalization payment based on the agreed NFPS, 
  as modified by removing all reference to the parties' investments in Edgemore, 
  as explained in these reasons, and as modified after a trial on the two issues 
  left to be determined.</p>
<p>
  [37] Costs of the appeal shall be to the wife on the partial indemnity scale, 
  fixed at $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
<p>&quot;K. Feldman J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree E.A. Cronk J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree Robert P. Armstrong J.A.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> The effect of this finding is that not 
  only the value of the property on the date of the agreement, but the property 
  itself, including any future increase (or decrease) in value is excluded from 
  any future equalization following reconciliation. See s. 4(2)(6) of the Family 
  Law Act.</p>
