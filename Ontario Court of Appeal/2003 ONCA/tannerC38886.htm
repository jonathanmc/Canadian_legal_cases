<p>On appeal from the orders of the Divisional Court (Robert A. Blair R.S.J., 
  Dennis Lane and Gloria J. Epstein JJ.) dated June 27, 2002, reported at (2002), 
  60 O.R. (3d) 304 and September 24, 2002, reported at (2002), 24 C.P.C. (5th) 
  68.</p>
<p>CARTHY J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] These two appeals were heard together and are, by leave of this court, 
  from decisions of the Divisional Court ordering production of medical reports 
  by the plaintiffs to the defendants. The issue is the application, if any, of 
  the implied undertaking rule to the circumstances in each case.</p>
<p>[2] The background facts are neatly summarized in the reasons of Epstein J., 
  speaking for the Divisional Court, as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">[1] Two appeals were heard together. They raise the 
  common issue of the application, if any, of the implied undertaking rule to 
  production obligations in the context of the interrelationship between arbitration 
  proceedings before the Financial Services Commission of Ontario concerning accident 
  benefits and actions for general and pecuniary damages. More specifically, the 
  common issue is whether or not the implied undertaking rule operates to protect 
  medical reports obtained in the arbitration proceeding from disclosure in the 
  tort action.</p>
<p class="indent">[2] In each of the two actions involved in this combined 
  appeal, the plaintiffs were injured in a car accident. As a result, the injured 
  parties in each action commenced two legal proceedings. The first was an arbitration 
  proceeding before the Ontario Insurance Commission (now the Financial Services 
  Commission of Ontario) with respect to accident benefits (the &#147;AB proceeding&#148;). 
  The second was their action in this court for general and pecuniary damages 
  (the &#147;tort action&#148;).</p>
<p class="indent">[3] In each case, the party who sustained the injuries 
  was compelled to submit to medical examinations at the behest of his or her 
  accident benefits insurer. The defendants in the tort actions requested production 
  of the medical reports prepared as a consequence of these examinations. This 
  request was denied. As a result of the denial, the defendants brought a production 
  motion. In each case, the motions judge relied on the application of the implied 
  undertaking rule to dismiss the motion. In a combined hearing for leave to appeal 
  to this court, Justice Hockin granted leave to appeal in both matters. </p>
<p>[3] In her reasons, Epstein J. finds the documents are relevant to the tort 
  proceedings and are not privileged. She then analyzes rule 30.1.01(3) (the deemed 
  undertaking rule) and concludes that, by its own terms, it does not apply to 
  the AB proceedings, but that the common law implied undertaking may have such 
  application. Following analysis of the relevant authorities she concludes that 
  the common law implied undertaking rule has no application to the attendant 
  circumstances, essentially because the principle behind the rule is directed 
  to protecting against use by the recipient of the information, not to protect 
  the information from all uses. Epstein J. then goes on to speak to the exercise 
  of discretion to enforce production if she is wrong on the main issue. I do 
  not need to deal with the latter because I am in entire agreement with her reasoning 
  and conclusion on the former &#150; it would be an extension of the common law 
  rule of implied undertaking to apply it to these cases.</p>
<p>[4] I adopt her reasons and add comments of my own only to emphasize how unwarranted 
  any extension of the rule would be.</p>
<p>[5] In Goodman v. Rossi (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 359 (Ont. C.A.) Morden A.C.J.O. 
  (as he then was) canvassed the origins and history of the common law rule and 
  I take as my springboard one excerpt at p. 369:</p>
<p class="indent"> The rationale for the implied undertaking rule is compendiously 
  stated in Matthews and Malek&#146;s Discovery (1992) at p. 253:</p>
<p class="indent15"> The primary rationale for the imposition of the implied 
  undertaking is the protection of privacy. Discovery is an invasion of the right 
  of the individual to keep his own documents to himself. It is a matter of public 
  interest to safeguard that right. The purpose of the undertaking is to protect, 
  so far as is consistent with the proper conduct of the action, the confidentiality 
  of a party&#146;s documents. It is in general wrong that one who is compelled 
  by law to produce documents for the purpose of particular proceedings should 
  be in peril of having those documents used by the other party for some purpose 
  other than the purpose of the particular legal proceedings and, in particular, 
  that they should be made available to third parties who might use them to the 
  detriment of the party who has produced them on discovery. A further rationale 
  is the promotion of full discovery, as without such an undertaking the fear 
  of collateral use may in some cases operate as a disincentive to proper discovery. 
  The interests of proper administration of justice require that there should 
  be no disincentive to full and frank discovery. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>[6] It is &#147;used by the other party&#148; and &#147;use them to the detriment 
  of the party who has produced them&#148; that are the keynote phrases. Rule 
  30.1.01(1) speaks in the same voice &#150; it is &#147;evidence obtained&#148; 
  on discovery that shall not be &#147;used&#148;. These verbs describe the acts 
  of receiving and disseminating information; they do not label the evidence as 
  sealed or privileged. The applicants in the AB proceedings submitted to medical 
  examinations knowing that the information they impart will not be used by the 
  two insurance companies except in those proceedings, and will not be communicated 
  to others for their use in other proceedings. That has not happened here. The 
  insurers in the tort proceedings are different companies and the information 
  is sought, not from the insurers in the AB proceedings, but from the source 
  of that information, the respective plaintiffs in the tort actions. Those plaintiffs 
  are not constrained in any way from the use of their medical information for 
  any purpose. What they argue for is not enforcement of an undertaking, but a 
  protective shield against production of very relevant evidence.</p>
<p>[7] In my view, it would do no service to the implied undertaking rule to extend 
  it in this fashion and would, indeed, be a considerable disservice. It would 
  wrap a cloak of privilege around evidence given in any administrative tribunal 
  hearing where a related issue arose in other proceedings. It would stand in 
  the way of courts and tribunals having available the best evidence, or all of 
  the evidence, bearing upon the issue in dispute.</p>
<p>[8] In sum, the rule should be as it has been &#150; a party is encouraged 
  to be candid with an opponent knowing that the opponent will not breach the 
  confidence.</p>
<p>[9] The intervenor, Ontario Trial Lawyers Association, supported the appeals 
  and urged the court to restrain production of the reports based upon access 
  to justice concerns. As the argument goes, production would necessitate the 
  plaintiffs hiring more medical experts to oppose those who had written, presumably 
  critical reports, in the earlier proceedings. In other words, plaintiffs were 
  being compelled to arm the defendants with ammunition and would have to hire 
  new experts to fend against them. This overlooks the limit on the number of 
  expert witnesses and, in any event cannot dictate limitations on discovery and 
  detract from a trial on the merits.</p>
<p>[10] For these reasons, I would dismiss both appeals. The parties have submitted 
  bills of costs, each for substantial amounts. There was some novelty to this 
  case and the appellants are not assured of establishing claims over the threshold. 
  I would award costs of the respondents in each appeal at the reduced amount 
  of $7,500 to be paid upon termination of the respective actions. The appellants 
  sought leave to appeal the costs orders in the Divisional Court. Those costs 
  were payable on the same terms as I am suggesting in this court and in reasonable 
  amounts. I would deny leave to appeal on this ground. The intervenor did not 
  ask for costs.</p>
