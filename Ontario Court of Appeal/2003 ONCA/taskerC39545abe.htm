<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the blended sentences of 23 months were manifestly unfit. 
  These were 8 profoundly exploitive breaches of trust performed over a period 
  of 9 years, starting when their son was 11 and concluding when he was 21. </p>
<p>[2] This court stated, in R. v. D.D., [2002] O.J. No. 1061 44 (C.A.), that 
  offences of this kind require a penitentiary term. There was no basis for deviating 
  from this principle given the repeated nature of the offences and the failure 
  of the parents adequately to appreciate the seriousness of their conduct.</p>
<p>[3] The sentencing judge, moreover, appeared to place undue reliance on what 
  can only be described as an inappropriately absolving report from Dr. Paul Vereshack; 
  ignored the repetitive nature of the assaults and treated them as isolated incidents; 
  and failed to give sufficient consideration to denunciation.</p>
<p>[4] Similarly, a blended sentence was unavailable on these facts. A conditional 
  sentence would not have been appropriate for any of these offences, let alone 
  their totality, rendering the 17 months conditional sentence unfit.</p>
<p>[5] The Crown sought a sentence of 3 years. This, in our view, while on the 
  low end of the range, is not unfit.</p>
<p>[6] Accordingly, leave to appeal the sentences is allowed, the appeals are 
  allowed, the sentences set aside, and a sentence substituted of 3 years, with 
  credit to be given for time served both in the reformatory and on the conditional 
  sentences.</p>
