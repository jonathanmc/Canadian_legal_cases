<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Ruth Mesbur released August 9, 2001.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The issue in this appeal is the propriety of an order requiring a lump 
  sum payment for spousal support. </p>  <P>
  [2] Michelle Tauber and Jeffrey Earl Tauber met in March 1995, married on May 
  17, 1996 and decided to separate in December 1997. Their marriage lasted 18 
  months. They had one child, Sam, who was born on August 5, 1997. </p>  <P>
  [3] Ms. Tauber worked as a freelance wardrobe and prop stylist for photo shoots 
  and commercials for eight years before her marriage and until her pregnancy. 
  Her annual income by the time she got married was over $60,000 and was increasing 
  steadily. </p>  <P>
  [4] Mr. Tauber is a businessman with an estimated annual income of $2.5 million. 
  He has a net worth of between $19 to $20 million. </p>  <P>
  [5] The parties entered into a marriage contract whereby they agreed that any 
  property would be divided according to ownership. This meant that when the parties 
  separated, Mr. Tauber retained the matrimonial home, worth $2.8 million. The 
  contract also provided that if the marriage broke down in the first three years 
  and there were children, Ms. Tauber's right to receive spousal support would 
  be determined by the parties or, failing agreement, by a court. In May 1998, 
  just after the separation and in accordance with the grid set out in the contract, 
  Ms. Tauber received $100,000 in lieu of any assets. The parties were unable 
  to agree on spousal support. </p>  <P>
  [6] The parties have already previously litigated custody and support (Tauber 
  v. Tauber (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 42; (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 53; (2000), 48 O.R. 
  (3d) 577; (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 81 (C.A.)). In the last of these decisions, the 
  Court of Appeal ordered a retrial of the support issues.</p>  <P>
  [7] At the retrial, the trial judge ordered Mr. Tauber to pay $11,173 monthly 
  in child support to Ms. Tauber, the amount stipulated by the Child Support Guidelines. 
  Mr. Tauber has abandoned his appeal from that order. </p>  <P>
  [8] The issue in this appeal is the trial judge's decision to award Ms. Tauber 
  $500,000 as a lump sum for spousal support. The standard of review is undisputed 
  and was confirmed in Willick v. Willick, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 670 at para. 114:</p>  
<P class="indent"> As far as the applicable standard of appellate review is concerned 
  I am of the view that we should not interfere with the trial Judge's decision 
  unless we are persuaded that his reasons disclose material error and this would 
  include a significant misapprehension of the evidence, of course, and, to use 
  familiar language, the trial Judge's having &quot;gone wrong in principle or 
  (his) final award (being) otherwise clearly wrong&quot;: Attwood v. Attwood, 
  [1968] P. 591, at p. 596. in other words, in the absence of material error, 
  I do not think that this Court has an &quot;independent discretion&quot; to 
  decide afresh the question of maintenance and I say this with due respect for 
  decisions to the contrary: see, e.g., Piller v. Piller (1975), 54 D.L.R. (3d) 
  150, [1975] 4 W.W.R. 342, 17 R.F.L. 252 (B.C.C.A.), and Carmichael v. Carmichael 
  (1976), 69 D.L.R. (2d) 297, 27 R.F.L. 325 (B.C.C.A.). [Emphasis added in Willick]</p>  
<P>
  [9] Mr. Tauber's position was that there should be no spousal support given 
  the length of the marriage. He argued that Ms. Tauber suffered no economic hardship 
  from the marriage, enjoying a far superior lifestyle than before the marriage. 
  If there were a support entitlement, he argued that it should not take the form 
  of a lump sum but rather periodic support limited to 3 years, the length of 
  the marriage and therefore the length of the disadvantage. In the alternative, 
  if this court accepts the propriety of a lump sum award, he disputes the quantum.</p>  <P>
  [10] In reaching her conclusion that a lump sum was appropriate, the trial judge 
  applied the factors in s. 15.2(4) of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.3 (2nd 
  Supp.) and concluded that while the &quot;condition, means, needs and other 
  circumstances of Mr. Tauber remain fairly stable, those of Ms. Tauber did not&quot;. 
  She noted that Ms. Tauber is a single parent whose earning capacity has been 
  impaired by the marriage and by her parenting responsibilities, and that her 
  financial needs have significantly increased since the marriage due in a large 
  part to the birth of their child.</p>  <P>
  [11] In addition, after examining the marriage contract, the trial judge concluded 
  that the $100,000 lump sum received by Ms. Tauber was in consideration of the 
  release of property claims, not of any support claims. The entire $100,000 was 
  required by Ms. Tauber for legal fees, which totalled over $200,000. </p>  <P>
  [12] The trial judge's assessment of Ms. Tauber's financial situation was that 
  she had a net worth of $115,000 at the time of the marriage and the ability 
  to earn $50,000 per year, both of which diminished in the aftermath of the separation. 
  Ms. Tauber received no spousal support from Mr. Tauber for three years. The 
  trial judge noted the extreme disparity between Ms. Tauber's economic circumstances 
  and reduced ability to earn income, and Mr. Tauber's exceptionally robust financial 
  situation. </p>  <P>
  [13] The trial judge's express goal was to fashion a support order designed 
  to promote the economic self-sufficiency of Ms. Tauber, who started to work 
  part-time in 1998, within a reasonable period of time. Given Ms. Tauber's age 
  and ability to contribute to her own support, she sought to award support in 
  the form that was most conducive to motivating Ms. Tauber's return to the full-time 
  workforce and ensuring her continuing self-sufficiency. She therefore decided 
  that a lump sum payment rather than ongoing periodic support was appropriate. 
  </p>  <P>
  [14] It is not disputed that Ms. Tauber, who has been living in rental accommodations 
  costing $4,000 to $5,000 monthly and requiring her to move almost annually, 
  seeks to apply the money towards a down payment on a home so that she can provide 
  residential stability for her child. The trial judge agreed, concluding that 
  Ms. Tauber was entitled to an amount of spousal support that would enable her 
  to provide more permanent living arrangements for Sam. The lump sum, in short, 
  was not only to compensate Ms. Tauber for the consequences of the marriage breakdown, 
  but also to give her some assistance in re-establishing herself in her career 
  as she works increasingly towards more full-time work. </p>  <P>
  [15] It was open to the trial judge, on this record, to accept Ms. Tauber's 
  submission that rental housing would affect the child's stability and that the 
  purchase of a home was a reasonable financial aspiration on Ms. Tauber's part. 
  In particular, we see nothing inappropriate about awarding a lump sum to provide 
  transitional economic relief to assist Ms. Tauber in promoting her economic 
  self-reliance, a reasonable goal given her age, past work experience, and talent. 
  </p>  <P>
  [16] The evidence supports the trial judge's conclusion that Ms. Tauber's earning 
  capacity was impaired by the marriage, her parenting responsibilities, and the 
  breakdown of the marriage. In Sam's interests, she is not able to accept some 
  contracts, particularly those which, while lucrative, involve being away from 
  Toronto. Her career has been, and continues to be, affected by her parenting 
  responsibilities while Mr. Tauber's career and financial consequences have not. 
  </p>  <P>
  [17] In our view, the trial judge's decision discloses no error either in principle 
  or in law justifying interference with her discretion. While we disagree with 
  her conclusion that the length of the marriage was a neutral factor, we are 
  nonetheless of the view that despite the brevity of the marriage, Ms. Tauber 
  was in need of economic support as a consequence of the marriage and that a 
  spousal support order was therefore justified. The short duration of the marriage 
  is, in our view, a relevant factor and militates against, in these circumstances, 
  an ongoing obligation for support. </p>  <P>
  [18] We agree that periodic payments would be less conducive in this case to 
  creating self-sufficiency for Ms. Tauber. A lump sum, on the other hand, can 
  enhance her economic self-sufficiency and operate as a one-time form of compensation 
  to enable her to establish residential roots for herself and her child in a 
  manner that would better approximate the lifestyle the child enjoyed while living 
  with both parents, a lifestyle to which Mr. Tauber has the means to contribute. 
  </p>  <P>
  [19] The trial judge undertook a careful analysis of the applicable principles 
  in the Divorce Act. Notwithstanding an error in her calculation of Ms. Tauber's 
  1996 income, an error which we think does not affect the result, the trial judge's 
  lump sum award is, in the circumstances, appropriate; in our view, an ongoing 
  order of spousal support would not have met the objectives of the Divorce Act 
  as appropriately as this award. While the amount ordered is, objectively, a 
  substantial sum, it must be seen in the context of Mr. Tauber's assets which 
  are worth between $19 and $20 million, his undisputed ability to pay, and the 
  parties' lifestyle during the marriage. In this light, the amount ordered is 
  not so far beyond what is reasonable as to justify our interference.</p>  <p>[20] The appeal is dismissed with costs. The parties will have until April 
  15, 2003 to exchange and file their costs submission.</p>
