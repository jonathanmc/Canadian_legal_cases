<p>On appeal from the restitution order in the sentence imposed by Justice Steven 
  Rogin of the Superior Court of Justice on January 10, 2003.</p>
<p> BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant pleaded guilty to a $4 million fraud and was sentenced to 
  two years in the penitentiary. He was also ordered to make restitution in the 
  full amount of the fraud. This appeal deals solely with the restitution order.</p>
<p> [2] The appellant, a pathological gambler, committed the fraud against his 
  employer over a period in excess of 13 years. Many mitigating factors led the 
  trial judge to impose the two-year sentence. The reasons of the trial judge 
  reveal that: </p>
<ul>
  <li> it was inevitable from the evidence that the appellant was destined to 
    become addicted to gambling;</li>
  <li> the appellant has taken all available means to rehabilitate himself, reconstructed 
    his marriage, found new employment and re-involved himself in the community;</li>
  <li> there is little or no chance of re-offending;</li>
  <li> the appellant is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, even without a $1.5 
    million assessment for taxes that is being disputed; and </li>
  <li>there was no other way to recompense the victim than by a penitentiary term.</li>
</ul>
<p> [3] The trial judge also recognized that the appellant will never be in a 
  position to repay even the most minute part of the fraud. The restitution order 
  was purely symbolic. However, in order to avoid putting the employer through 
  the extra legal expense of going to the civil courts, the trial judge, without 
  analysis of any of the factors that are relevant to the imposition of a restitution 
  order, ordered restitution for the full amount of the fraud.</p>
<p> [4] At the time of sentencing, the appellant was 56 years of age. He earned 
  approximately $470.00 per week. His wife was working and earning approximately 
  the same amount and she is paying a tax assessment which results from the fraud. 
  They owned a home valued at approximately $110,000 with a mortgage of approximately 
  $76,500.00 requiring monthly payments of $792.00. We were not advised of any 
  change since the sentence was imposed.</p>
<p> [5] It has been stated many times that restitution is a discretionary order. 
  It should only be made with restraint and caution and not only in order to avoid 
  putting the victim through the extra legal expense of going to the civil courts 
  or as a substitute for civil procedure.</p>
<p> [6] As stated by Martin J.A., speaking for this court, in R. v. Scherer (1984), 
  16 C.C.C. (3d) 30 at 38:</p>
<p class="indent"> It may be that in some cases it would be inappropriate to make 
  a compensation order in an amount that is unrealistic to think that the accused 
  could ever discharge.</p>
<p> [7] In his reasons, the trial judge said:</p>
<p class="indent"> The only possible way to complete that part of his rehabilitation 
  is through penal consequences. Because of the magnitude of the crime, the duration 
  of the crime, there is no other way to compensate the victims other than his 
  family, then by a penitentiary term [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [8] He then ordered restitution. The restitution order appears to have been 
  added as an afterthought to permit the victim to avoid the costs of a civil 
  action. The Crown had not asked for a restitution order.</p>
<p> [9] The relevant factors and objectives to the imposition of a restitution 
  order have been discussed by this court in R. v. Devgan (1999), 136 C.C.C. (3d) 
  238 and R. v. Biegus (1999), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 245. An order for restitution must 
  also bear some reality to the circumstances of the appellant and must be directly 
  associated with the sentence imposed as the public reprobation of the offence. 
  In the circumstances of this case, the overriding factor is the means of the 
  appellant. There is no ability, as noted by the trial judge, to pay even the 
  most minute part of this staggering amount, with no expiry date. It would kill 
  all hope for the appellant for the future and it would likely impair his chances 
  of rehabilitation. The order is clearly excessive and futile and the trial judge 
  erred in that regard.</p>
<p> [10] It remains open to the victim to take proceedings in the civil court, 
  if so advised.</p>
<p> [11] Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed and the restitution 
  order is set aside.</p>
