<p>On appeal from conviction by Justice Thomas A. Heeney of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, sitting with a jury, on December 19, 2001 and from sentence imposed 
  on February 25, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] On December 19, 2001, after trial by judge and jury, the appellant was 
  convicted of two counts of indecent assault in relation to two of his step-daughters, 
  R.M. and M.L and one count of illicit sexual intercourse with M.L.</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>[2] The offences are historical in nature. The indecent assault on R.M. occurred 
  between September 1967 and February 1973 when R.M. was an adolescent. The event 
  itself involved the appellant placing his hands under R.M.'s shirt and holding 
  her breasts for a period of about 5 minutes. The indecent assault on M.L. occurred 
  between September 1967 and February 1973. M.L. recalled that she was about 11 
  years old at the time. In this instance, the appellant pulled M.L.'s pants and 
  underwear down and touched her vagina with his fingers for a few minutes.</p>
<p>
  [3] As for the charge of illicit sexual intercourse, the appellant began having 
  full intercourse with M.L. around 1976, when she was about 15 years old. The 
  sexual misconduct continued on a regular and persistent basis for the better 
  part of ten years, until 1986.</p>
<p>
  [4] With respect to sentence, the trial judge imposed a prison term of 15 months 
  for the offence of illicit sexual intercourse and six months each on the two 
  counts of indecent assault, concurrent to each other and concurrent to the 15-month 
  sentence on the count of illicit sexual intercourse. Hence, the appellant received 
  a total sentence of 15 months imprisonment. In addition, the trial judge placed 
  him on probation for a period of two years. At the time the offences were committed, 
  the maximum term of imprisonment for illicit intercourse with a step-daughter 
  was two years. The offence of indecent assault carried a maximum punishment 
  of five years imprisonment. The appellant appeals against conviction and sentence. 
  The Crown cross-appeals against the sentence.</p>
<p>
  Conviction Appeal</p>
<p>[5] The appellant raises several grounds of appeal against conviction, all 
  of which relate to certain evidence which the trial judge left to the jury as 
  similar fact evidence.</p>
<p>
  [6] Before addressing the issues, we note that the similar fact evidence in 
  question is not evidence from a third party about events not covered by the 
  indictment. Rather, it relates to the evidence given by M.L. and R.M. on the 
  various counts relating to each and the use, if any, the jury could make of 
  one's evidence in deciding whether the Crown had made out its case in relation 
  to the other.</p>
<p>
  [7] In view of this, a separate &quot;admissibility&quot; hearing was not required. 
  The sole issue for the trial judge was whether there was a proper basis in fact 
  and law for permitting the jury to consider the evidence of one as similar fact 
  evidence in deciding whether the Crown had proved its case in relation to the 
  other. Against this backdrop, the appellant raises three complaints.</p>
<p>
  [8] First, he submits that he was prejudiced in the conduct of his defence because 
  the use of the complainants' evidence as similar fact evidence was not raised 
  before or during the evidentiary phase of the trial but only at the precharge 
  conference. According to the appellant, had he been alerted to the similar fact 
  issue earlier, he might have altered his defence strategy. In particular, he 
  submits that he might have moved for severance and if unsuccessful, he might 
  have focused more intensely on the dissimilarities in the complainants' evidence 
  or alternatively, on the likelihood of collusion. </p>
<p>
  [9] We would not give effect to this argument for two reasons.</p>
<p>
  [10] First, we reject the underlying premise that the Crown was obliged to give 
  the defence advance notice of its intention to use the complainants' evidence 
  as similar fact evidence. As a matter of law, the defence knew or should have 
  known that this possibility existed from the outset. Absent an express undertaking 
  from the Crown not to use the evidence in this fashion (of which there was none 
  here), the defence cannot claim that it was misled. Accordingly, we reject the 
  submission that lack of notice occasioned prejudice to the defence and resulted 
  in an unfair trial.</p>
<p>
  [11] Second, even if 'timely' notice had been given, we doubt that it would 
  have altered the defence strategy in any meaningful way. A severance motion 
  would almost certainly have failed. The dissimilarities in the complainants' 
  evidence were obvious and 'more intense' cross-examination would have accomplished 
  little. The essence of the defence was that the complainants and their immediate 
  family members had conspired together to &quot;get&quot; the appellant and their 
  evidence was the product of collusion. This theme was pervasive throughout the 
  trial and it is fanciful to think that it would have received more attention 
  had the defence been alerted to the similar fact issue. Accordingly, we would 
  not give effect to the first branch of the appellant's argument.</p>
<p>
  [12] The appellant next submits that it was wrong for the trial judge to leave 
  the evidence of the complainants to the jury as similar fact evidence because 
  whatever limited probative value it might have was far outweighed by its prejudicial 
  effect. </p>
<p>
  [13] We disagree. The trial judge determined, correctly in our view, that the 
  evidence of each complainant was capable of confirming the testimony of the 
  other and that the potential for prejudice could be circumvented by a strong 
  limiting instruction. The trial judge did precisely that in his charge. He instructed 
  the jury in clear terms on the limited use that could be made of the evidence 
  and the manner in which it could not be used. To be sure, the jury was not overwhelmed 
  by the similar fact evidence. They acquitted the appellant of a second charge 
  of indecent assault against R.M.</p>
<p>
  [14] In short, we see no error in the trial judge's assessment of the evidence 
  as similar fact evidence or in his instruction to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [15] Finally, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to 
  instruct the jury on the matter of collusion and its impact on the probity of 
  the similar fact evidence.</p>
<p>
  [16] We agree that it would have been preferable had the trial judge dealt specifically 
  with the issue of collusion in his charge. In all of the circumstances however, 
  we are not persuaded that his failure to do so constituted reversible error.</p>
<p>
  [17] The evidence of collusion in this case was weak. To the extent that it 
  went beyond mere speculation, it did so just barely. Unquestionably, the complainants 
  shared with each other the fact that they had been abused by the appellant. 
  They denied going further and sharing the details. The dissimilarities in their 
  evidence as to the nature and extent of the appellant's abusive conduct towards 
  them bears this out. In any event, as indicated, the theme of the defence throughout 
  was that the complainants had put their heads together and concocted false allegations 
  against the appellant to pay him back for the mistreatment they had received 
  at his hands during their formative years. This theme pervaded the trial. It 
  was pressed by the defence in cross examination, it was addressed by the defence 
  and the Crown in their closing remarks and it was repeated by the trial judge 
  in his charge, both in his recitation of the evidence and his review of the 
  position of the parties.</p>
<p>
  [18] In these circumstances, it is fanciful to think that the jury would have 
  been unaware of the significance of collusion in assessing the worth of the 
  similar fact evidence and in deciding whether the case for the Crown had been 
  proved. On the contrary, despite the lack of a specific instruction, we are 
  satisfied that the jury would have been alive to the issue of collusion and 
  that they would have acquitted the appellant on all counts had they believed 
  or entertained a reasonable doubt that the evidence of the complainants was 
  the product of collusion. </p>
<p>
  [19] For these reasons, we would dismiss the appeal from conviction.</p>
<p>
  Sentence Appeal</p>
<p>[20] The appellant maintains that the trial judge erred in failing to impose 
  a conditional sentence. In the cross-appeal, the Crown submits that the trial 
  judge erred in failing to impose consecutive sentences for the offences of indecent 
  assault. </p>
<p>
  [21] The trial judge gave cogent reasons for holding that a conditional sentence 
  was not appropriate in the circumstances. We see no basis for interfering with 
  his conclusion. Accordingly, we would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the 
  appellant's appeal from sentence. </p>
<p>
  [22] With respect to the cross-appeal, we agree with the Crown that the trial 
  judge erred in failing to impose a consecutive sentence on the indecent assault 
  charge involving R.M. In all of the circumstances, we think a six-month consecutive 
  sentence was called for. </p>
<p>
  [23] Accordingly, we would grant leave to the Crown on its cross-appeal and 
  vary the sentence on count one to six months consecutive. In all other respects, 
  the sentence imposed at trial shall remain the same.</p>
