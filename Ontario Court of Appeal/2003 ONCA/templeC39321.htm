<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This appeal arises from an order of Farley J., which granted the respondents' 
  application for a declaration that they have no duty to defend the appellants 
  under an &quot;Errors and omissions liability insurance policy for environmental 
  consultants&quot;. The action for which the appellants assert an entitlement 
  to a defence was brought by the Ontario Realty Corporation. The allegations 
  in that action involve the appellants' environmental consulting and remedial 
  work on thirty-five different properties. At the heart of that action are allegations 
  of deceit, secret commissions, bid rigging, and conspiracy. However, there are 
  also claims advanced in breach of contract and negligence.</p>
<p>
  [2] The claims relating to sixteen of the thirty-five properties involve bid-rigging 
  and secret commissions that, on their face, are excluded by the Fraudulent Act 
  exclusion in the policy.</p>
<p>
  [3] With respect to the remaining nineteen properties, which are the subject 
  of this appeal, Farley J. found: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) The claims in respect of seven properties were excluded 
  pursuant to the Design/Build exclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) The claims in respect of six properties were derivative 
  of the acts excluded by the Fraudulent Act exclusion and as such did not give 
  rise to a duty to defend.</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) The claims with respect to six properties were not sufficiently 
  clear, on the state of the pleadings, to determine whether or not the duty to 
  defend arises. </p>
<p>
  In our view, Farley J. correctly determined each of these issues.</p>
<p>
  (i) Design Build Exclusion</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellants submit that the effect of the Design/Build exclusion is to 
  deny coverage only where the insured does both consulting work and remediation 
  work on the same property. Accordingly, with respect to the properties for which 
  the appellants did only remediation work, the appellant submits that the Design/Build 
  exclusion does not apply. We do not accept that argument. In our view, it is 
  clear from the terms of the policy that the appellants are not covered for any 
  claims arising from actual construction or remediation work. The Design/Build 
  clause must be read in conjunction with the policy's definition of &quot;insured 
  services&quot; as &quot;those services rendered by the Insured, while acting 
  within the scope of the INSURED'S duties as an environmental consultant and 
  customary to the practice of environmental consulting&quot;. The combined effect 
  of the &quot;insured services&quot; definition and the Design/Build exclusion 
  is to exclude from coverage any claim arising from services involving physical 
  performance of work on the property. These excluded services include any actual 
  construction, installation, manufacturing, or clean-up work performed by the 
  appellants. There is no ambiguity introduced by the use of the words &quot;also 
  performed&quot; in the design build exclusion. Coverage is afforded for consulting 
  services, but not when remediation work is &quot;also performed&quot;.</p>
<p>
  (ii) Derivative Claims</p>
<p>
  [5] In deciding whether the harm allegedly inflicted by the negligent conduct 
  is derivative of intentional conduct excluded from coverage, the Supreme Court 
  of Canada held in Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyd's of London v. Scalera. [2000] 
  1 S.C.R. 551 at 554: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A claim for negligence will not be derivative if the underlying elements of 
  the negligence and of the intentional tort are sufficiently disparate to render 
  the two claims unrelated. However, if both the negligence and intentional tort 
  claims arise from the same actions and cause the same harm, the negligence claim 
  is derivative, and it will be subsumed into the intentional tort for the purposes 
  of the exclusion clause analysis. </p>
<p>
  [6] The plaintiff's claims of negligence, as pleaded in the main action, arise 
  from precisely the same allegations giving rise to the claims of fraud, conspiracy 
  and dishonesty. Indeed, the plaintiff's pleadings repeat the same factual allegations 
  in support of both claims of fraud and alternative claims of negligence. </p>
<p>
  [7] The test to be applied here is stated by Iacobucci J. at 554 of Scalera: 
  &quot;A plaintiff cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply 
  by choice of words&#133;.when ascertaining the scope of the duty to defend, 
  a court must look beyond the choice of labels, and examine the substance of 
  the allegations contained in the pleadings.&quot; That is the test applied by 
  the application judge and we are not persuaded that he erred in his assessment 
  of the substance of the claims and in his determination that the claims are 
  derivative of the acts excluded by the Fraudulent Act exclusion. </p>
<p>
  (iii) Unclear Claims</p>
<p>
  [8] We agree with the application judge's assessment of the claims relating 
  to the 6 properties listed in Schedule D to the statement of claim. The statement 
  of claim is virtually silent as to the facts alleged to support those claims, 
  and on the present state of the pleading, it would be premature to make any 
  determination of the duty to defend.</p>
<p>
  (iv) Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [9] We agree with the appellants' submission that the declaration should conform 
  with the relief sought by the respondents. Accordingly, the word &quot;defend&quot; 
  should be inserted in the place of the words &quot;cover/defend&quot; in paragraphs 
  2 and 3 of the order under appeal. Otherwise, the appeal is dismissed. The respondents 
  are entitled to their cost of the appeal fixed at $5,000 inclusive of GST and 
  disbursements as agreed by the parties. </p>
