<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice G. I. Thomson on December 5, 2000.</p>
<p><br>
  ABELLA J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The primary issue in this appeal is whether the use of a Forward Looking 
  Infra-Red (&quot;FLIR&quot;) aerial camera to detect heat rays emanating from 
  a private home, constitutes a search within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter 
  of Rights and Freedoms. </p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The RCMP began investigating the appellant, Walter Tessling, in February 
  1999. Early in the investigation, the police received information from two confidential 
  informants, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The only informant who provided any specific information about the appellant 
  was &quot;A&quot;. &quot;A&quot; was an &quot;unproven source&quot;, meaning 
  that he or she had not previously provided the police with information resulting 
  in criminal charges. &quot;A&quot;'s tip was that the appellant and a partner, 
  Ken Illingworth, were involved in the production and trafficking of marijuana. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[4] &quot;B&quot; had been an informant on previous occasions and the information 
  provided by him or her had resulted in the laying of three drug charges. &quot;B&quot; 
  told police that a known drug dealer was buying large quantities of drugs from 
  a man named &quot;Ken&quot; in the area in which Illingworth had a farm. &quot;B&quot; 
  gave the police no information about Tessling.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] Based on the information provided by the informants, the police contacted 
  Ontario Hydro to find out if there was unusual hydro usage at any of the properties 
  owned by Tessling or Illingworth, which would be consistent with a marijuana 
  growing operation. Ontario Hydro responded that the usage was normal. However, 
  the police continued their investigation based on their belief that it was possible 
  that the appellant and Illingworth were by-passing the hydro meters. <br>
</p>
<p>[6] Visual surveillance of Tessling's and Illingworth's residences revealed 
  nothing that would lead to the conclusion that a marijuana growing operation 
  was taking place at those locations.<br>
</p>
<p>[7] On April 29, 1999, the police used an RCMP airplane equipped with a FLIR 
  camera to conduct a &quot;structure profile&quot; of the properties owned by 
  Tessling and Illingworth, that is, to detect heat emanating from buildings.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] The FLIR takes a picture or image of the thermal energy or heat radiating 
  from the exterior of a building. It can detect heat sources within a home depending 
  on the location of the source, and how well the house is insulated, but it cannot 
  identify the exact nature of that source or see inside the building. <br>
</p>
<p>[9] The use of the FLIR is not affected by the altitude of the aircraft from 
  which it is operated. In the information used to obtain the search warrant, 
  the FLIR system's technological capacity to detect internal heat patterns is 
  described as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">[FLIR technology] is currently in use by major law enforcement 
  agencies and departments throughout Canada and the United States for various 
  types of applications, and has grown to become a significant investigative tool 
  for law enforcement agencies.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Thermal infrared systems are often used to conduct &quot;structure 
  profiles&quot;. These devices are passive instruments which are sensitive to 
  only thermal surface radiant temperature. The devices do not see into, or through 
  structures. The FLIR system detects only energy which is radiated from the outside 
  surface of an object. Internal heat which is transmitted to the outside surface 
  of an object is detectable. This device &#133; is essentially a camera that 
  takes photographs of heat instead of light&#133; The rooms of marijuana growing 
  operations with halide lights are warmer than the average room in a residence. 
  The walls of these rooms emanate this heat to the outside, and are therefore 
  detectable by the FLIR. Heat in a residence is usually evenly distributed throughout 
  the building's exterior. By comparing the pattern of heat emanating from the 
  structure, it is possible to detect patterns of heat showing rooms or sections 
  of a structure that may be housing the marijuana growing operation.<br>
</p>
<p>[10] The use of FLIR technology is based on the operative theory that while 
  heat usually emanates evenly from a building, the lights used in marijuana growing 
  operations give off an unusual amount of heat. By comparing the pattern of heat 
  emanating generally from a building to the heat from specific areas, the FLIR 
  images can show patterns of heat in a building that might have a marijuana growing 
  operation.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] The FLIR camera in this case indicated that the appellant's property and 
  one of the properties owned by Illingworth had the heat emanations potentially 
  indicative of a marijuana growing operation. As a result, on May 5, 1999, the 
  RCMP applied for a &quot;telewarrant&quot;. This request was denied. <br>
</p>
<p>[12] An application for a warrant before a different judge later the same day 
  and based on modified information, was successful. The information used to obtain 
  this warrant consisted of the information from the two confidential informants, 
  and the results of the FLIR examination of Tessling's home. <br>
</p>
<p>[13] When the RCMP entered the home, they found a large quantity of marijuana, 
  two sets of scales, and freezer bags. They also found some weapons. </p>
<p>THE TRIAL<br>
</p>
<p>[14] At trial, the appellant brought an application pursuant to s. 24(2) of 
  the Charter to exclude the items found at his home during the search.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] The defence's main submission on the application was that the information 
  used to obtain the search warrant did not meet the test in R. v. Debot, [1989] 
  2 S.C.R. 1140 at para. 53, namely:<br>
</p>
<p>1) Was the information predicting the commission of the criminal offence compelling?</p>
<p>2) If the information was based on a tip originating from a source outside 
  the police, was that source credible?</p>
<p>3) Was the information corroborated by a police investigation prior to making 
  the decision to conduct the search?</p>
<p>[16] The defence argued that the information supplied by &quot;A&quot; was 
  not compelling or credible because most of the information was in the form of 
  conclusory statements, and there was insufficient information to assess whether 
  this information was reliable. <br>
</p>
<p>[17] The defence also challenged the sufficiency of the FLIR images as sufficient 
  corroboration of A's information. Even though six days had passed between the 
  FLIR examination and the application for the search warrant, the police had 
  done nothing to confirm that there was still a marijuana growing operation at 
  the residence. <br>
</p>
<p>[18] Finally, the defence argued that the use of the FLIR aerial technology 
  was an unlawful search. Since the information of &quot;A&quot; was unreliable, 
  and since the police could not have obtained a warrant to search the appellant's 
  premises based on the information of &quot;A&quot; alone, the police had insufficient 
  justification for conducting a search. This made the search warrantless and 
  therefore unreasonable, and represented a sufficiently serious breach of the 
  appellant's privacy rights that the evidence resulting from it should be excluded.<br>
</p>
<p>[19] The Crown argued that based on the totality of the circumstances, the 
  test in Debot was met. Although &quot;A&quot; was &quot;unproven&quot; in the 
  sense that A's information had not yet been used to secure a criminal conviction, 
  &quot;A&quot; was in fact reliable. There was a correlation between many things 
  &quot;A&quot; told the police and things learned through &quot;B&quot;, a proven 
  informant. There had also been an extensive police investigation independent 
  of what the police had learned through the informants. Combined with the information 
  from the FLIR, there was sufficient information upon which a justice of the 
  peace could be satisfied that there was a reasonable probability that an offence 
  was being committed on the premises, and thus was justified in issuing a warrant.<br>
</p>
<p>[20] As to the FLIR technology, the Crown argued that it was a recognized and 
  accepted police surveillance tool, not a search. <br>
  <br>
  Ruling on the Charter Application<br>
</p>
<p>[21] The trial judge agreed with the Crown that the use of FLIR technology 
  was not a search within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter and that, considering 
  the totality of the circumstances, the test in Debot had been met, stating:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">It is well recognized that the home should be granted 
  the highest degree of protection from unwanted state intrusions. There is nothing 
  wrong in police officers [placing a home under surveillance] from outside its 
  perimeter boundaries to determine if people come and go in such numbers as to 
  indicate to experienced police officers that a marijuana growing and/or trafficking 
  activity is going on inside. This is simple surveillance.<br>
  There is no doubt that the schedule could have contained more detail. The officer 
  acted in good faith throughout. I am satisfied that cumulatively based on the 
  totality of the circumstances in this case that the Justice of the Peace had 
  sufficient detail to form reasonable and probable grounds that a search warrant 
  should issue, which would have the effect of intruding on the expectation of 
  privacy of the accused in their residence.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I have considered the tests in Debot and find that the 
  totality of the evidence could lead the Justice of the Peace to find that the 
  evidence predicting the commission of the criminal offence was compelling. Further, 
  that the information from source &quot;A&quot; was credible and that the FLIR 
  was confirmatory or corroborative of some marijuana growing operation in the 
  basement of the [appellant's residence].<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">There was little possibility of an innocent coincidence, 
  even though there may have been several other explanations for the excessive 
  heat in the basement like a furnace close to a window, a sauna, a hot tub or 
  insufficient insulation.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I find that FLIR technology, if properly used in a valid 
  search warrant, does not constitute an unwarranted transgression or intrusion 
  into the reasonably expected privacy of an occupant of a residence.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The warrant, in this case, was valid and the search 
  thereunder was reasonable.<br>
</p>
<p>[22] In the alternative, the trial judge concluded that had there been a breach 
  of s. 8, he would not have excluded the evidence under s. 24(2) for the following 
  reasons: <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;There was no question that the police officers 
  acted in bad faith. They felt that they were using a lawful technique and were 
  acting in accordance with a lawfully issued search warrant.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . . <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;I find that the admission into evidence of the 
  items would not result in an unfair trial. Any breach would be serious as it 
  concerned a private residence. However, to exclude the admissibility of the 
  items would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.<br>
</p>
<p>[23] Since the evidence was not excluded, Tessling admitted the balance of 
  the elements of the drug and weapons offences with which he was charged, except 
  for the trafficking offence. A trial proceeded on the trafficking charge alone, 
  and Tessling was convicted. He was sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment for possession 
  of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking, 6 months concurrent for related 
  drug offences, and a total of 12 months for the weapons offences. </p>
<p>ANALYSIS<br>
</p>
<p>[24] At the trial of Ken Illingworth, which took place after Tessling's trial, 
  the trial judge quashed the warrant based on the insufficiency of the evidence. 
  The appellant sought to introduce testimony from the Illingworth trial as fresh 
  evidence on this appeal. Given the following conclusions, it is unnecessary 
  to deal with this motion.<br>
</p>
<p>[25] The focus of this appeal was on whether the use of the FLIR device constituted 
  an unreasonable search within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights and 
  Freedoms. If so, the Crown concedes that in the absence of the FLIR images, 
  there was insufficient evidence to support the issuance of a warrant.<br>
</p>
<p>[26] The appellant's main submission was that to the extent that FLIR technology 
  is used to provide state agents with information which could not otherwise be 
  obtained without an intrusion into the home, the examination is a search within 
  the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter. Because the information was used to identify 
  activities in his home, Tessling argued that the search violated his reasonably 
  held expectations of privacy. Since it was warrantless, with no other reliable 
  information to support a warrant and no exigent circumstances, the search was 
  an unreasonable one: see R. v. Kokesch, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 3.<br>
</p>
<p>[27] The appellant submits that the appropriate jurisprudential analogies for 
  the FLIR technology can be found in the surreptitious audio-visual recordings 
  at issue in R. v. Duarte, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30, the video recordings in R. v. 
  Wong, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 36, and the tracking device in R. v. Wise, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 
  527. <br>
</p>
<p>[28] In Duarte, the court found that, as a general proposition, &quot;surreptitious 
  electronic surveillance of an individual by an agency of the state constitutes 
  an unreasonable search or seizure under s. 8&quot;, and requires prior judicial 
  authorization in the form of a warrant.<br>
</p>
<p>[29] The court made similar findings in Wong, where it held that individuals 
  in a hotel room have a reasonable expectation of privacy.<br>
</p>
<p>[30] In Wise, the court found a violation of s. 8 when a tracking device placed 
  on someone's car allowed the state to &quot;electronically track&quot; an individual.<br>
</p>
<p>[31] The Crown had two main submissions in this appeal. Firstly, a FLIR aerial 
  examination comes within the meaning of what has traditionally been construed 
  as surveillance and not a search, and the use of technology does not elevate 
  such surveillance into a search. Secondly, the heat emanations from a residence 
  do not reveal any intimate details about the activities within the home, and 
  so the privacy interest, if any, is trivial. It argued that heat emanations, 
  like the electricity consumption in R. v. Plant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281, revealed 
  very little about the &quot;personal lifestyle or private decisions&quot; of 
  the appellant.<br>
</p>
<p>[32] Furthermore, the Crown contends that there is no reasonable expectation 
  of privacy in the heat emanating from the surface of a residence, since people 
  do not generally take steps to mask the visible signs of heat emanations, such 
  as snow melting on a roof, or steam or frost residue on windows. Even if there 
  were some privacy interest in the heat emanations and what might be inferred 
  from them, that privacy interest does not outweigh the compelling state interest 
  in preventing marijuana growing.<br>
  Was There a Violation of s. 8?<br>
</p>
<p>[33] The home is an environment whose privacy has consistently and insistently 
  been designated by the courts as worthy of the state's highest respect. The 
  question in this case, however, is whether the privacy interest in the home 
  extends to heat generated inside the home but reflected on the outside.<br>
</p>
<p>[34] In my view, for the reasons which follow, the use of FLIR technology to 
  detect heat emanations from a private home constitutes a search and requires, 
  absent exigent circumstances, prior judicial authorization.<br>
</p>
<p>[35] Section 8 of the Charter states:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable 
  search and seizure.<br>
</p>
<p>[36] Two inquiries are engaged by a s. 8 challenge, as articulated in R. v. 
  Edwards, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;The first is whether the accused had a reasonable 
  expectation of privacy. The second is whether the search was an unreasonable 
  intrusion on that right to privacy (at para. 33).<br>
</p>
<p>[37] Bastarache J. summarized the nature of the s. 8 inquiry in R. v. Law (2002), 
  208 D.L.R. (3th) 207 as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">It has long been held that the principal purpose of 
  s. 8 of the Charter is to protect an accused's privacy interests against unreasonable 
  intrusion by the State. Accordingly, police conduct interfering with a reasonable 
  expectation of privacy is said to constitute a &quot;search&quot; within the 
  meaning of the provision.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">This Court has adopted a liberal approach to the protection 
  of privacy. This protection extends not only to our homes and intimately personal 
  items, but to information which we choose, in this case by locking it in a safe, 
  to keep confidential&#133;As a 1972 task force on privacy and computers noted, 
  informational privacy &quot;derives from the assumption that all information 
  about a person is in a fundamental way his own, for him to communicate or retain 
  .. as he sees fit&quot;: Privacy and Computers, Report of the Task Force Established 
  Jointly by the Department of Communications/Department of Justice (1972), at 
  p. 13&#133;(at paras. 15 and 16).<br>
</p>
<p>[38] In R. v. Evans, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 8, Sopinka J. defined a search for the 
  purposes of s. 8, and concluded that the conduct of the police approaching the 
  door to someone's home with the intention of sniffing for marijuana when the 
  occupants opened the door, was a search within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter. 
  His rationale was the following:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">As this court stated in Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 
  2 S.C.R. 145, the objective of s. 8 of the Charter is &quot;to protect individuals 
  from unjustified state intrusions upon their privacy&quot;. Clearly, it is only 
  where a person's reasonable expectations of privacy are somehow diminished by 
  an investigatory technique that s. 8 of the Charter comes into play. As a result, 
  not every form of examination conducted by the government will constitute a 
  search for constitutional purposes. On the contrary, only where those state 
  examinations constitute an intrusion upon some reasonable privacy interest of 
  individuals does the government action in question constitute a search within 
  the meaning of s. 8 (at para. 11).<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, there are sound policy reasons for holding 
  that the intention of the police in approaching an individual's dwelling is 
  relevant in determining whether or not the activity in question is a &quot;search&quot; 
  within the meaning of s. 8. If the position of my colleague is accepted and 
  intention is not a relevant factor, the police would then be authorized to rely 
  on the &quot;implied licence to knock&quot; for the purpose of randomly checking 
  homes for evidence of criminal activity. The police could enter a neighbourhood 
  with a high incidence of crime and conduct surprise &quot;spot checks&quot; 
  of the private homes of unsuspecting citizens, surreptitiously relying on the 
  implied licence to approach the door and knock. Clearly, this Orwellian vision 
  of police authority is beyond the pale of any &quot;implied invitation&quot;. 
  As a result, I would hold that in cases such as this one, where evidence clearly 
  establishes that the police have specifically adverted to the possibility of 
  securing evidence against the accused through &quot;knocking on the door&quot;, 
  the police have exceeded the authority conferred by the implied licence to knock 
  (at para. 20).<br>
</p>
<p>[39] Writing for himself, Cory and Iacobucci JJ., Sopinka J., when listing 
  what he considered to be examples of lawful investigatory techniques, notably 
  included &quot;overhead infrared photography&quot; (at para. 29).<br>
  [40] In Plant, supra, Sopinka J. concluded, for the majority, that there was 
  no reasonable expectation of privacy in utility records held by a utility company. 
  He gave the following further direction about what constitutes &quot;privacy&quot;:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;[I]n order for constitutional protection to be 
  extended, the information seized must be of a &quot;personal and confidential&quot; 
  nature. In fostering the underlying values of dignity, integrity and autonomy, 
  it is fitting that s. 8 of the Charter should seek to protect a biographical 
  core of personal information which individuals in a free and democratic society 
  would wish to maintain and control from dissemination to the state. This would 
  include information which tends to reveal intimate details of the lifestyle 
  and personal choices of the individual. The computer records investigated in 
  the case at bar while revealing the pattern of electricity consumption in the 
  residence cannot reasonably be said to reveal intimate details of the appellant's 
  life since electricity consumption reveals very little about the personal lifestyle 
  or private decisions of the occupant of the residence (at para. 20).<br>
</p>
<p>[41] It is significant that the focus of the analysis in Plant was not on whether 
  there is a privacy interest in home energy consumption, but on whether one has 
  a reasonable expectation of privacy in records held by third parties. The Court 
  focused on the commercial relationship between the utility company and the accused 
  as a utility user, concluding that the information available in the records 
  was subject to inspection by members of the public at large. This supported 
  the finding that the accused did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy 
  in the records. Sopinka J. outlined the requisite balancing analysis as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Consideration of such factors as the nature of the information 
  itself, the nature of the relationship between the party releasing the information 
  and the party claiming its confidentiality, the place where the information 
  was obtained, the manner in which it was obtained, and the seriousness of the 
  crime being investigated allow for a balancing of the societal interests in 
  protecting individual dignity, integrity and autonomy with effective law enforcement 
  (at para. 19).<br>
</p>
<p>[42] Justice McLachlin, in concurring reasons, took a different view of the 
  hydro information, emphasizing its ability to reveal what activities are taking 
  place inside the home:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The question in each case is whether the evidence discloses 
  a reasonable expectation that the information will be kept in confidence and 
  restricted to the purposes for which it was given. Although I find the case 
  of electricity consumption records close to the line, I have concluded that 
  the evidence here discloses a sufficient expectation of privacy to require the 
  police obtain a warrant before eliciting the information. I conclude that the 
  information was not public, since there is no evidence suggesting this information 
  was available to the public and the police obtained access only by reason of 
  a special arrangement. The records are capable of telling much about one's personal 
  lifestyle, such as how many people lived in the house and what sort of activities 
  were probably taking place there. The records tell a story about what is happening 
  inside a private dwelling, the most private of places&#133;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;The very reason the police wanted these records 
  was to learn about the appellant's personal lifestyle, i.e. the fact that he 
  was growing marihuana. More generally, electricity consumption records may, 
  as already noted, reveal how many people live in a house and much about what 
  they do. While not as revealing as many types of records, they can disclose 
  important personal information ( at paras. 41-42).<br>
</p>
<p>[43] To date, few Canadian courts have dealt with the FLIR technology. In R. 
  v. Hutchings (1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 215 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal refused 
  [1997] S.C.C.A. No. 21, the British Columbia Court of Appeal explicitly declined 
  to address the issue whether using a FLIR device generally constitutes a search. 
  It held that a warrantless search of an abandoned barn using a FLIR device did 
  not violate s. 8 of the Charter. The police had learned from a confidential 
  informant of unknown reliability, that a marijuana growing operation might be 
  located in a barn. An aerial FLIR examination revealed an abnormal amount of 
  heat emanating from the barn's roof. After further investigation of the appellant's 
  hydro records, the police charged him with trafficking. He challenged the admissibility 
  of the evidence against him on the basis that the FLIR technology was unconstitutional. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[44] The Court found that while the appellant had keys to the barn, he was 
  not the owner of the property and there was no evidence that he lived in the 
  nearby house, registered in his sister's name. He was therefore found to have 
  no reasonable expectation of privacy in heat emanations from the barn. As McEachern 
  C.J.B.C. stated:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;However, I do not consider it necessary to pronounce 
  generally upon the use of such a device in the circumstances of this case because 
  I do not believe that appellant had any reasonable expectation of privacy regarding 
  the escape of heat from this barn. No &quot;private&quot;, &quot;personal&quot; 
  or &quot;core biographical information&quot; was at risk or obtained. It might 
  of course be different if the FLIR device could extend the operator's sight 
  or hearing into a residence or other private place, as to which see R. v. Duarte 
  &#133; But that is not this case and I do not think that the appellant should 
  reasonably be surprised by observations, even enhanced observations, directed 
  to the outside or roof of a barn (at para. 29) [emphasis added].<br>
</p>
<p>[45] The United States Supreme Court, in Kyllo v. United States (2001), 121 
  S. Ct. 2038, found that the warrantless use of FLIR technology was an unlawful 
  search constituting a violation of the Fourth Amendment, which states:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, 
  house, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall 
  not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported 
  by an oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, 
  and the person or things to be seized.<br>
</p>
<p>[46] Based in part on thermal imaging, a judge had issued a warrant to search 
  Kyllo's home, where agents subsequently found a marijuana growing operation. 
  Kyllo unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence seized from his home, and 
  then entered a conditional guilty plea. The Ninth Circuit Appeals Court affirmed 
  the trial judge's ruling, holding that thermal imaging was constitutional, on 
  the ground that Kyllo had shown no subjective expectation of privacy because 
  he had made no attempt to conceal the heat escaping from his home. Even if he 
  had, ruled the Court, he had no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy 
  because there were no details of Kyllo's life gained from the thermal imaging, 
  only amorphous hot spots on his home's exterior.<br>
</p>
<p>[47] A majority of the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the decision, holding 
  instead, per Scalia J., that:<br>
  Where, as here, the Government uses a device that is not in general public use, 
  to explore the details of a private home that would previously have been unknowable 
  without physical intrusion, the surveillance is a Fourth Amendment &quot;search&quot; 
  and is presumptively unreasonable without a warrant (at para. 25).<br>
</p>
<p>[48] Scalia J. recognized, at para. 14, that warrantless visual surveillance 
  of a home is constitutional in the United States and that &quot;Fourth Amendment 
  protection of the home has never been extended to require law enforcement officers 
  to shield their eyes when passing by a home on public thoroughfares&quot;. He 
  noted that a search does not occur even when the explicitly protected location 
  of a house is concerned, unless an individual has a subjective expectation of 
  privacy which society is willing to recognize as reasonable.<br>
</p>
<p>[49] Nevertheless, Scalia J. found, at para. 16, that thermal imaging &quot;involves 
  officers on a public street engaged in more than naked-eye surveillance of a 
  home&quot;. Emphasizing the importance of Fourth Amendment protections for people's 
  homes, he stated:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;We think that obtaining by sense-enhancing technology 
  any information regarding the interior of the home that could not otherwise 
  have been obtained without physical &quot;intrusion into a constitutionally 
  protected area&quot;,&#133;[citations excluded] constitutes a search - at least 
  where (as here) the technology in question is not in general public use (at 
  para. 18).<br>
</p>
<p>[50] He rejected the government's argument that the thermal imaging was constitutional 
  because it &quot;detected only heat radiating from the external surface of the 
  house&quot; (at para. 6), and that there was a &quot;fundamental difference 
  between what it referred to as 'off-the-wall' observations and 'through-the-wall 
  surveillance' as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;But just as a thermal imager captures only heat 
  emanating from a house, so also a powerful directional microphone picks up only 
  sound emanating from a house - and a satellite capable of scanning from many 
  miles away would pick up only visible light emanating from a house. We rejected 
  such a mechanical interpretation of the Fourth Amendment in Katz, where the 
  eavesdropping device picked up only sound waves that reached the exterior of 
  the phone booth. Reversing that approach would leave the homeowner at the mercy 
  of advancing technology - including imaging technology that could discern all 
  human activity in the home. While the technology used in the present case was 
  relatively crude, the rule we adopt must take account of more sophisticated 
  systems that are already in use or in development (at para. 19).<br>
</p>
<p>[51] Scalia J. also rejected the government's arguments that thermal imaging 
  was constitutional because it did not &quot;detect private activities occurring 
  in private areas&quot;, and because the court had previously upheld the constitutionality 
  of enhanced aerial photography of an industrial complex in Dow Chemical Co. 
  v. United States, 476 U.S. 227, by stating:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Dow Chemical, however, involved enhanced aerial photography 
  of an industrial complex, which does not share the Fourth Amendment sanctity 
  of the home. The Fourth Amendment's protection of the home has never been tied 
  to measurement of the quality or quantity of the information obtained. In Silverman, 
  for example, we made clear that any physical invasion of the structure of the 
  home, &quot;by even a fraction of an inch&quot; was too much [citations excluded] 
  &#133; and there is certainly no exception to the warrant requirement for the 
  officer who barely cracks open the front door and sees nothing but the non-intimate 
  rug on the vestibule floor. In the home, our cases show, all details are intimate 
  details, because the entire area is held safe from prying government eyes&#133; 
  These were intimate details because they were details of the home, just as the 
  detail of how warm - or even how relatively warm - Kyllo was heating his residence.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Limiting the prohibition of thermal imaging to &quot;intimate 
  details&quot; would not only be wrong in principle, it would be impractical 
  in application, failing to provide a &quot;workable accommodation between the 
  needs of law enforcement and the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment&quot;. 
  &#133;To begin with there is no necessary connection between the sophistication 
  of the surveillance equipment and the &quot;intimacy&quot; of the details it 
  observes - which means that one cannot say (and the police cannot be assured) 
  that the use of the relatively crude equipment at issue here will always be 
  lawful. The Agema Thermovision 210 might disclose, for example, at what hour 
  each night the lady of the house takes her daily sauna and bath - a detail that 
  many would consider &quot;intimate&quot;; and a much more sophisticated system 
  might detect nothing more intimate than the fact that someone left a closet 
  light on. We could not, in other words, develop a rule approving only that through-the-wall 
  surveillance which identifies objects no smaller than 36 by 36 inches, but would 
  have to develop a jurisprudence specifying which home activities are &quot;intimate&quot; 
  and which are not. And when (if ever) that jurisprudence were fully developed, 
  no police officer would be able to know in advance whether his through-the-wall 
  surveillance picks up intimate details - and thus would be unable to know in 
  advance whether it is constitutional (at paras. 20-21).<br>
</p>
<p>[52] Writing for four dissenting judges, including Chief Justice Rehnquist, 
  Stevens J. minimized the intrusiveness of the technology, stating:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">There is, in my judgment, a distinction of constitutional 
  magnitude between &quot;through-the-wall surveillance&quot; that gives the observer 
  or listener direct access to information in a private area on one hand, and 
  the thought processes used to draw inferences from information in the public 
  domain, on the other hand. The Court has crafted a rule that purports to deal 
  with direct observations of the inside of the home, but the case before us merely 
  involves indirect deductions from &quot;off-the-wall&quot; surveillance, that 
  is observations of the exterior of the home. Those observations were made with 
  a fairly primitive thermal imager that gathered data exposed on the outside 
  of the petitioner's home but did not invade any constitutionally protected interest 
  in privacy (at para. 28).<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . . <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">While the Court &quot;take[s] the long view&quot; and 
  decides this case based largely on the potential of yet-to-be-developed technology 
  that might allow &quot;through-the-wall&quot; surveillance &#133; this case 
  involves nothing more than off-the-wall surveillance by law enforcement officers 
  to gather information exposed to the general public from the outside of the 
  petitioner's home. All that the infrared camera did in this case was passively 
  measure heat emitted from the exterior surfaces of the petitioner's home; all 
  that those measurements showed were relative differences in emission levels, 
  vaguely indicating that some areas of the roof and outside walls were warmer 
  than others (at para. 30).<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed the ordinary use of the senses might enable a 
  neighbour or passer-by to notice the heat emanating from a building, particularly 
  if it is vented as was the case here. Additionally, any member of the public 
  might notice that some part of a house is warmer than another part or a nearby 
  building if, for example, rainwater evaporates or snow melts at different rates 
  across its surfaces&#133; Nor, in my view, does such observation become an unreasonable 
  search if made from a distance with the aid of a device that merely discloses 
  that the exterior of one house, or one area of the house, is much warmer than 
  another. Nothing more occurred in this case (at para. 31).<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . . <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">To be sure, the homeowner has a reasonable expectation 
  of privacy concerning what takes place within the home, and the Fourth Amendment's 
  protection against physical invasions of the home should apply to their functional 
  equivalent. But the equipment in this case did not penetrate the walls of the 
  petitioner's home, and while it did pick up &quot;details of the home&quot; 
  that were exposed to the public&#133;it did not obtain &quot;any information 
  regarding the interior of the home&quot; (at para 33).<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">. . .<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Since what was involved in this case was nothing more 
  than drawing inferences from off-the-wall surveillance, rather than any through-the-wall 
  surveillance, the officers' conduct did not amount to a search and was perfectly 
  reasonable (at para. 36).<br>
</p>
<p>[53] Stevens J. was also of the view that no new rule was needed to decide 
  this case, since under Fourth Amendment principles searches and seizures inside 
  a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable and searches and seizures 
  of property in plain view are presumptively reasonable.<br>
</p>
<p>[54] Although they do not deal with FLIR technology, two Canadian appellate 
  court decisions point out that what constitutes an &quot;unreasonable search&quot; 
  may involve a more textured analysis than simply asking whether the information 
  in issue was accessible to public view.<br>
</p>
<p>[55] In R. v. Kelly (1999), 169 D.L.R. (4th) 720, the New Brunswick Court of 
  Appeal found that low level aerial surveillance of the accused's residential 
  lot was an unreasonable search. No FLIR camera was used. The police had used 
  a helicopter hovering about 30 feet over the accused's garden to determine that 
  he was growing plants which appeared to be marijuana. The garden was shielded 
  from public view by other vegetation. The police subsequently conducted a ground 
  search of the area around the accused's house and seized marijuana plants. The 
  issue was whether the warrantless aerial inspection was an unreasonable search. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>[56] In concluding that s.8 protects against aerial searches, the court noted 
  that the requirement of a warrant would not unduly hamper law enforcement:</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;As a rule, lawful occupants have an expectation 
  of privacy in all open spaces within their residential lots that is qualitatively 
  sufficient to invest them with s.8 protection against unlawful aerial as well 
  as terrestrial searches. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I am convinced that the recognition of such an expectation 
  of privacy will not unduly hamper law enforcement. It is trite that unlawful 
  searches of private property are not essential to effective law enforcement 
  and that the police have at their disposal a variety of lawful means to efficiently 
  counter marijuana production on residential properties. The delays in obtaining 
  search warrants are minimal. As well, exigent circumstances may dispense with 
  the need for a warrant altogether [emphasis added]&#133;<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Kelly owned and lived on the property searched from 
  the air. His possession and control was such that he could regulate access to 
  the property. Mr. Kelly definitely had a subjective expectation of privacy with 
  respect to his relatively small residential lot. The remote location of this 
  residential lot and the density of the woods surrounding it merely emphasize 
  the point. Bearing in mind that s.8 must be broadly and liberally construed, 
  I am satisfied that Mr. Kelly's subjective expectation of privacy is objectively 
  reasonable and that it deserves constitutional protection, not only against 
  unreasonable ground searches but against aerial searches as well (at paras. 
  50-53).<br>
</p>
<p>[57] In R. v. Lauda (1999), 136 C.C.C. (3d) 358 (Ont. C.A.) the police received 
  an anonymous tip that marijuana was being grown in a cornfield. A police officer 
  went to the location to verify the tip. Because a four foot high steel gate 
  barred his entry to a dirt road leading to the property and he could see no 
  cornfield, the officer climbed over the gate and walked up a hill. As he proceeded 
  over the crest of the hill, he saw a cornfield surrounded by a fence. Upon entering 
  the cornfield, he found marijuana plants hidden by the corn. The next day, two 
  other officers went to the cornfield to remove the plants. The officers did 
  not have a warrant on either visit. The accused was charged with producing marijuana 
  and possession for the purpose of trafficking. The Crown argued, based on the 
  American &quot;open fields&quot; doctrine, that the usual rules regarding search 
  and seizure did not apply. <br>
</p>
<p>[58] After a thorough discussion of the doctrine, Moldaver J.A., for the Court, 
  concluded:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Having considered both sides of the argument, I am of 
  the view that the open fields doctrine cannot survive s.8 Charter scrutiny. 
  To be specific, I am unprepared to interpret s.8 of the Charter in a manner 
  which would, without exception, foreclose property holders from asserting an 
  expectation of privacy in unoccupied lands on the basis that society does not 
  recognize the expectation as reasonable (at para 16).<br>
</p>
<p>[59] Moldaver J.A. noted that persons in lawful possession of unoccupied lands 
  in Canada have the right to exclude members of the public from their property, 
  and that an expectation of privacy which society is prepared to recognize as 
  reasonable, can exist even if the property is visible to the public. <br>
</p>
<p>[60] I turn then to the use of FLIR technology in this case. There can be no 
  question that the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities 
  carried on within his residence. The central issue in this appeal is whether 
  the use of FLIR technology constitutes an unreasonable intrusion into that privacy 
  interest. In my view, it does for the following reasons.<br>
</p>
<p>[61] First, the FLIR technology reveals information about activities that are 
  carried on inside the home. While the technology measures heat emanating from 
  the outer walls of the house, the source of those emanations is located inside. 
  Moreover, the sole reason that police photograph the heat emanations is to attempt 
  to determine what is happening inside the house. The fact that it is necessary 
  for the police to draw inferences from the heat emanating from the external 
  walls in order to deduce what those internal activities are, does not change 
  the nature of what is taking place. The use of the FLIR technology was an integral 
  step in ascertaining what was occurring inside the appellant's home.<br>
</p>
<p>[62] The analysis in Evans, supra, where the Supreme Court found that a search 
  had taken place, is helpful. Both the heat rays in this case and the scent of 
  marijuana in Evans emanated from the house. While I accept that technically 
  what is being scrutinized is heat from the surface of a home, it is impossible 
  to ignore the fact that those surface emanations have a direct relationship 
  to what is taking place inside the home.<br>
</p>
<p>[63] Secondly, I am satisfied that the FLIR technology discloses more information 
  about what goes on inside a house than is detectable by normal observation or 
  surveillance. In my view, there is an important distinction between observations 
  that are made by the naked eye or even by the use of enhanced aids, such as 
  binoculars, which are in common use, and observations which are the product 
  of technology.<br>
</p>
<p>[64] In Wong, supra, the Supreme Court was alert to the intrusive capacity 
  of technological surveillance and consequently cautioned:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;In Duarte, this Court held that unauthorized electronic 
  audio surveillance violates s. 8 of the Charter. It would be wrong to limit 
  the implications of that decision to that particular technology. Rather what 
  the Court said in Duarte must be held to embrace all existing means by which 
  the agencies of the state can electronically intrude on the privacy of the individual, 
  and any means which technology places at the disposal of law enforcement authorities 
  in the future (at para. 8).<br>
</p>
<p>[65] In any event, I do not share the Crown's view that the FLIR reveals information 
  that is in plain view and easily observable. A member of the public can walk 
  by a house and observe the snow melting on the roof, or look at the house with 
  binoculars, or see steam rising from the vents. Without FLIR technology, however, 
  that person cannot know that it is hotter than other houses in the area or that 
  one room in particular reveals a very high energy consumption. FLIR technology, 
  in other words, goes beyond observation, disclosing information that would not 
  otherwise be available and tracking the external reflections of what is happening 
  internally. <br>
</p>
<p>[66] It is, it seems to me, overly simplistic to characterize the constitutional 
  issue in this case as whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in 
  heat emanating from a home. The surface emanations are, on their own, meaningless. 
  But to treat them as having no relationship to what is taking place inside the 
  home, is to ignore the stated purpose of their being photographed, that is, 
  to attempt to determine what is happening inside that home. It would, I think, 
  directly contradict the reasonable privacy expectations of most members of the 
  public to permit the state, without prior judicial authorization, to use infrared 
  aerial cameras to measure heat coming from activities inside private homes as 
  a way of trying to figure out what is going on inside. <br>
</p>
<p>[67] An individual's expectation that the state will respect the privacy of 
  information about activities in his or her home, is a manifestly reasonable 
  one. Unlike Plant, where the information sought by the state is already known 
  and in the hands of a third party, namely the utility company, this is information 
  unknowable without the FLIR technology. Like the interests protected in Duarte 
  and Wong, the measurement of heat emanations from inside a home is the measurement 
  of inherently private activities which should not be available for state scrutiny 
  without prior judicial authorization. <br>
</p>
<p>[68] The FLIR represents a search because it reveals what cannot otherwise 
  be seen and detects activities inside the home that would be undetectable without 
  the aid of sophisticated technology. Since what is being technologically tracked 
  is the heat generated by activity inside the home, albeit reflected externally, 
  tracking information through FLIR technology is a search within the meaning 
  of s. 8 of the Charter.<br>
</p>
<p>[69] Some perfectly innocent internal activities in the home can create the 
  external emanations detected and measured by the FLIR, and many of them, such 
  as taking a bath or using lights at unusual hours, are intensely personal. It 
  seems to me, therefore, that before the state is permitted to use technology 
  that has the capacity for generating information which permits public inferences 
  to be drawn about private activities carried on in a home, it should be required 
  to obtain judicial authorization to ensure that the intrusion is warranted.<br>
</p>
<p>[70] This is not to suggest that the FLIR's electronic surveillance technology 
  cannot be used for the enforcement of marijuana offences, only that its use, 
  except in urgent circumstances, be predicated on prior judicial authorization 
  to protect individuals from unwarranted state intrusion on their reasonably 
  held expectations of privacy.<br>
</p>
<p>[71] Having concluded that the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy 
  in the heat emanating from activities inside his home, the next issue is whether 
  the search was an unreasonable intrusion on the right to privacy. The law is 
  clear that warrantless searches are presumptively unreasonable, absent exigent 
  circumstances (Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145; R. v. Collins, [1987] 
  1 S.C.R. 265; Evans, supra; and R. v. Grant, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 23. There were 
  no such circumstances in this case and no other evidence sufficient to rebut 
  the presumption of unreasonableness.<br>
</p>
<p>[72] Accordingly, I am satisfied that the use of the FLIR technology to detect 
  heat emanating from the appellant's home was a breach of his rights under s. 
  8 of the Charter, and the search warrant obtained on the basis of that information 
  was therefore not lawfully obtained.</p>
<p>Should the Evidence be Excluded under Section 24(2)? </p>
<p>[73] The remaining issue is whether the evidence obtained pursuant to the unlawful 
  search should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter, which states: 
  <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court 
  concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any 
  rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded 
  if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission 
  of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.<br>
</p>
<p>[74] The test for exclusion involves a consideration of the fairness of the 
  trial, the seriousness of the violation, and the effect of excluding the evidence 
  on the administration of justice: see R. v. Collins, supra.<br>
</p>
<p>[75] I agree with the trial judge that there is no issue of trial fairness 
  in this case. The evidence which the appellant seeks to have excluded is real 
  evidence and he was not conscripted into either its creation or discovery: see 
  R. v. Stillman, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 607.<br>
</p>
<p>[76] In my view, as the trial judge acknowledged, the breach of the appellant's 
  s. 8 rights must be considered a serious breach. This was state intrusion into 
  a most protected physical zone of privacy - the home. It can hardly be disputed 
  that technologically enhanced forms of police surveillance expand the state's 
  intrusive capacity and therefore create a qualitatively more significant threat 
  to privacy than surveillance unaided by electronic devices. There is, it seems 
  to me, a critical difference between the surveillance possible without this 
  technology and what is possible with it. <br>
</p>
<p>[77] In reaching the conclusion that the breach is serious, I do not impute 
  bad faith to the police. The law on FLIR technology in this country is embryonic, 
  with both a Supreme Court of Canada reference in Evans, albeit fleeting and 
  in obiter, and an appellate court in Hutchings, supra, appearing to cast no 
  doubt on its legality. But Evans did not deal directly with its constitutionality 
  and Hutchings, which did, was carefully crafted to limit its application to 
  the facts of that case, namely the search of a barn, not a home.<br>
</p>
<p>[78] As to the suggestion that the information gleaned is limited to heat emanations, 
  causing no more than a technical breach, I would counter that this characterization 
  of the FLIR's capacity is overly technical. It is true that on the continuum 
  of intrusiveness, the FLIR device is less informative than other means of electronic 
  surveillance such as wiretapping. Nonetheless, because it provides to state 
  agents information about activities in the home which could not otherwise be 
  obtained without intrusion, the breach is serious. <br>
</p>
<p>[79] The heat emanations measured by the FLIR are not visible to the ordinary 
  viewer and cannot be quantified without the technology. The nature of the intrusiveness 
  is subtle but almost Orwellian in its theoretical capacity. Because the FLIR's 
  sensor cannot penetrate walls, it is true that a clear image of what actually 
  transpires inside the home is not made available by the FLIR device. However, 
  it is not the clarity or precision of the image which dictates the potency of 
  the intrusiveness: rather, it is the capacity to obtain information and draw 
  public inferences about private activities originating inside the home based 
  on the heat patterns they externally generate, that renders the breach serious.<br>
</p>
<p>[80] I turn then to the effect on the administration of justice of either admitting 
  or excluding the marijuana evidence obtained from the search of the appellant's 
  home. The exercise, in this case, distils into a balancing of the seriousness 
  of the breach with the seriousness of the offence being investigated. In balancing 
  the competing interests, I am of the view that given the seriousness of the 
  violation compared to the seriousness of the offence of marijuana growing which 
  inspired the unlawful search, greater disrepute to the administration of justice 
  would flow from the admissibility than the exclusion of the evidence.<br>
</p>
<p>[81] I acknowledge that in 1993, the Supreme Court of Canada in Plant observed 
  that preventing marijuana growing was a compelling state interest. It is impossible 
  to ignore, however, that since that decision, there has been public, judicial, 
  and political recognition that marijuana is at the lower end of the hierarchy 
  of harmful drugs. This means that in the speculative judicial balancing exercise 
  inherent in determining how best to protect public confidence in the administration 
  of justice under s. 24(2), the weight of this offence is lighter on the scales 
  than other drug-related offences.<br>

<p>[82] The breach of an individual's right to privacy in his or her home, on 
  the other hand, can only be characterized as serious. As between the right of 
  an individual to be assured of protection from the state's unwarranted invasion 
  of privacy in the home, and the state's right to intrude on that privacy to 
  catch marijuana growers, I see public confidence being enhanced more by excluding, 
  rather than admitting, the marijuana evidence in issue.<br>
</p>
<p>[83] The Crown did not make any submissions to suggest that the evidence relating 
  to the weapons charges should be treated differently from the marijuana-related 
  evidence. Without the evidence seized from the appellant's residence, the Crown 
  has no admissible evidence to support any of the charges. I would therefore 
  allow the appeal, set the convictions aside, and enter verdicts of acquittal.</p>
