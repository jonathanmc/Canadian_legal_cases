<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] This appeal is essentially fact driven. The trial judge took a dim view 
  of the appellant's evidence. She described him as being evasive, argumentative 
  and unresponsive and found that he showed an astonishing disdain for the judicial 
  process as a means of resolving the dispute. In the circumstances, we are not 
  persuaded that there is a basis for interfering with the trial judge's findings 
  favouring the respondent. The trial judge did not err in her application of 
  the law to the facts as she found them. Accordingly, we would not give effect 
  to the various grounds of appeal raised by the appellant that challenge the 
  trial judge's equalization assessment.</p>
<p>
  [2] We are also of the view that it was open to the trial judge, in the exercise 
  of her discretion, to award pre-judgement interest from April 12, 1992 to the 
  date of the release of her judgment. We also see no basis for interfering with 
  the trial judge's award of costs.</p>
<p>
  [3] The cross-appeal is dismissed as abandoned. No costs.</p>
<p> [4] With respect to the appeal, the respondent is entitled to her costs which 
  we fix at $6,500 inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements on a partial indemnity 
  basis.</p>
