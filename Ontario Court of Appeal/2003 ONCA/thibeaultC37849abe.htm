<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The trial judge considered the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; 
  in deciding that the officer had reasonable grounds for the arrest of the appellant.</p>    <P>
  [2] We see no error in his analysis of the evidence and do not accept the submission 
  that the trial judge's assessment of those factors was unreasonable.</p>    <P>
  [3] We agree with the trial judge that the fact that the informant did not reveal 
  the source of his information to the officer does not preclude a finding that 
  reasonable grounds were established on the totality of the circumstances. The 
  informant's source of his information is but one factor which must be considered 
  as part of the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot;.</p>    <P>
  [4] There is no error in principle in the imposition of consecutive sentences. 
  The total sentence (14 months) is fit. We would not alter the sentence.</p>    <P>
  [5] The appeals are dismissed.</p>
