<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Susan G. Himel of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on January 21, 2002.</p>
<p>
  CHARRON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The issue raised on this appeal is whether the jury's verdict of guilty 
  on two weapons offences is inconsistent with the verdict of not guilty on two 
  other weapons offences where the four charges related to the same weapon and 
  the case was put to the jury by both Crown and defence counsel as an &quot;all 
  or nothing&quot; proposition. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant was convicted of weapons trafficking and transferring a prohibited 
  firearm without lawful authority contrary to s. 99(1) and s. 101(1) of the Criminal 
  Code, respectively. The latter charge was stayed pursuant to the principle in 
  R. v. Kienapple (1974), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. The appellant was acquitted by 
  the same jury of two possession charges in respect of the same weapon, possession 
  of a prohibited firearm for the purpose of transferring and possession of a 
  weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace contrary to s. 100(1) and 
  s. 88(1) of the Criminal Code. The appellant was also acquitted on two other 
  charges not relevant to this appeal, threatening and harassment. </p>
<p>
  [3] The weapon in question was an 8 millimetre handgun that had been drilled 
  out so that it could shoot .25 calibre cartridges. In its altered state, the 
  weapon fell within the definition of a prohibited firearm under sections 2 and 
  84 of the Criminal Code. The appellant testified that he found the weapon in 
  a park and, upon inspecting it, he determined that it was a replica pistol. 
  However, his testimony about the discovery of the weapon and his determination 
  that it was only a replica was inconsistent in some respects with a statement 
  he had given to the police. A couple of days after the discovery of the weapon, 
  the appellant received a call from his cousin who said she was looking to purchase 
  a gun. While there were divergent testimonies relating to the circumstances 
  of the ultimate sale, it was undisputed at trial that the appellant eventually 
  sold the weapon to his cousin. It was also undisputed that by the time the weapon 
  was later recovered by the police, it had been altered and transformed into 
  a prohibited firearm. The circumstances of the sale, the timing of the alterations 
  to the weapon, and the appellant's knowledge of its prohibited character were 
  in issue at trial. The events relating to the additional charges of harassment 
  and threatening were also very much in issue at trial. These charges, not relevant 
  to this appeal, related to the appellant's efforts to obtain payment from his 
  cousin for the weapon. </p>
<p>
  [4] Both Crown counsel and defence counsel at trial argued the case in respect 
  of the four weapons charges as revolving entirely on the issue of whether the 
  appellant knew that the weapon had been altered such that it was a prohibited 
  weapon prior to the time that he sold it. It was the Crown's theory at trial 
  that the jury should convict the appellant of all four weapons charges if they 
  were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he had this knowledge. In the 
  same way, it was the defence position that if the jury had a reasonable doubt 
  that the appellant had the required knowledge, it was their duty to acquit him 
  of all four weapons charges.</p>
<p>
  [5] In these circumstances, the appellant submits that the acquittal on the 
  two possession charges is inconsistent with the verdict of guilty on the two 
  transferring charges and that the latter two convictions should be set aside.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [6] The test the appellant has to meet is well-known. It was set out by this 
  court in R. v. McLaughlin (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 562 (Ont. C.A.) as follows 
  at p. 567: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The fact that verdicts may be inconsistent does not mean that in all cases the 
  Court of Appeal ex necessitate must quash the conviction or grant a new trial. 
  If the verdicts are violently at odds and the same basic ingredients are common 
  to both charges then the conviction will be quashed but the onus is on the appellant 
  to show that no reasonable jury who had applied their minds to the evidence 
  could have arrived at that conclusion.</p>
<p>Hence, in order to determine whether the verdicts are &quot;violently at odds&quot;, 
  it is necessary to consider not only the evidence and the position of counsel, 
  but also the legal ingredients of the offences in question and the trial judge's 
  instructions to the jury. </p>
<p>
  [7] In this case, it is my view that the appellant does not meet this test because 
  he cannot show that the &quot;same basic ingredients are common&quot; to both 
  sets of charges. The distinction between the possession charges in respect of 
  which the appellant was acquitted and the trafficking and transferring charges 
  in respect of which he was convicted is that the former required a finding as 
  to the appellant's purpose. In order to convict the appellant of possession 
  for the purpose of transferring the weapon, the jury had to be satisfied beyond 
  a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the weapon in his possession for that 
  purpose. Likewise, in order to convict him of possession for a purpose dangerous, 
  they had to be convinced that he had the weapon in his possession for a purpose 
  dangerous to public peace. The trial judge instructed the jury accordingly. 
  It is also noteworthy that she instructed the jury to consider and assess the 
  evidence with respect to each of the counts separately and to arrive at a separate 
  verdict in relation to each. Even though counsel at trial put the case to the 
  jury as an &quot;all or nothing&quot; proposition, the jury was not bound to 
  accept the theory advanced by either counsel. They were bound, however, to follow 
  the judge's instructions on the law. </p>
<p>
  [8] In my view, there is no difficulty in explaining the difference between 
  the verdicts on the trafficking and transferring charges on the one hand, and 
  on the possession for a purpose dangerous to public peace charge on the other. 
  It is readily apparent from the trial judge's instructions to the jury that 
  the focus on the possession charge was the question of whether the appellant's 
  purpose for having the weapon in his possession was dangerous to public peace. 
  Her instructions in relation to this additional element of the offence were 
  extensive: </p>
<p class="indent"> You will have to look at all the surrounding circumstances 
  in order to decide whether or not Mr. Thomas knew that he had a weapon, as I 
  have defined it for you, in his possession and that he had it for a purpose 
  dangerous to the public peace. You will have to decide whether he had it for 
  that purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">The formation of the unlawful purpose may be inferred from the 
  circumstances in which the weapon is used and possessed and that formation of 
  the unlawful purpose must precede its use. You may find it difficult to decide 
  exactly what Mr. Thomas' purpose was. This is because the reason or purpose 
  for doing something is a matter within his mind.</p>
<p class="indent">However, you are entitled as a matter of common sense to infer 
  or conclude that Mr. Thomas' purpose was to bring about the natural consequences 
  of his actions. If his actions would have the natural effect of possessing a 
  weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, then you are entitled to 
  conclude that they were done for that purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">However, you are not required to make this conclusion. You may 
  decide that there is reasonable doubt about his actions that they were done 
  for that purpose even if this was the natural consequences of his actions.</p>
<p class="indent">You will have to consider all of the surrounding circumstances 
  in order to decide whether or not his possession of the weapon was for a purpose 
  dangerous to the public peace. If you are left with a reasonable doubt as to 
  whether his purpose was dangerous to the public peace, then you must find him 
  not guilty of the charge.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, to give you some assistance as to how the law defines dangerous 
  to the public peace, dangerous means creating peril or risk. The law gives a 
  broad definition to the expression public peace. It refers to the &quot;normal 
  state of society&quot; and is synonymous with the general peace and order of 
  the realm as provided for by law. It is &quot;that quiet, peace and security 
  which is guaranteed by the laws for the personal comfort and safety of the people 
  of Canada.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent">A purpose dangerous to the public peace would be a purpose which 
  imperils the comfort, tranquility, security or safety of a citizen of this country. 
  Therefore, you must ask yourselves whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that Mr. Thomas possessed a weapon for such a purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">You must also ask yourselves whether the Crown has proved beyond 
  a reasonable doubt that Mr. Thomas possessed a weapon for such purpose with 
  the intention of using it for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. In considering 
  the element of the intention of the accused, you should consider the nature 
  of the weapon, the circumstances under which he had it in his possession, how 
  he acquired it and the manner of its use. If after consideration of all of the 
  evidence you are left with a reasonable doubt whether Mr. Thomas intended to 
  possess a gun for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, then you must find 
  him not guilty of this charge.</p>
<p class="indent">In considering this essential element of the charge I should 
  point out to you that the Crown did not call evidence suggesting the use to 
  which Mr. Thomas put the weapon which is alleged to have been in his possession. 
  The Crown simply called evidence of him having it in his possession and giving 
  it over to Roshane James, expecting to receive money in return. </p>
<p>
  [9] I note in passing that the instructions were overly generous to the appellant 
  to the extent that it was suggested to the jury that it was necessary for the 
  Crown to prove that the appellant intended to use the weapon for a purpose dangerous 
  to public peace to prove the offence, as opposed to simply possessing it for 
  that purpose. In any event, the verdicts can be explained by the fact that the 
  jury may have had a doubt on whether the appellant possessed the weapon for 
  the required purpose and may have acquitted the appellant on that basis. In 
  these circumstances, it cannot be said that the verdict of not guilty on this 
  charge is violently at odds with the verdicts of guilt on the trafficking and 
  transferring charges. </p>
<p>
  [10] The distinction between the acquittal on the possession of the weapon for 
  the purpose of transferring charge and the convictions on the trafficking and 
  transferring charges is admittedly more difficult to explain on the evidence. 
  Nonetheless, the jury was likewise instructed in respect of this possession 
  offence that one of the necessary elements of the offence was the purpose for 
  which the appellant was in possession of the weapon. Amongst other things, the 
  trial judge instructed the jury as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> The real issue in this case on this count is whether you are 
  satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence took place in that Mr. 
  Thomas had the gun in its modified form. That is, did he have it in his possession 
  in the form that it was when it was picked up by Detective Emond, who received 
  it from Cleveland Williams, who says he got it from Roshane James, and the same 
  gun examined by Mr. Nielson.</p>
<p class="indent">You should have little or no difficulty concluding that Mr. 
  Thomas had a gun in his possession. What you must decide is whether he knew 
  that it was a prohibited firearm and possessed it for the purpose of transferring 
  it, knowing that he was not authorized to do so. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [11] Again, on this charge, from a logical standpoint, the jury could well have 
  focussed on the appellant's purpose for having the weapon in his possession 
  since this was the distinguishing element of this offence. The appellant's testimony 
  that he had found the weapon was undisputed. Hence the jury would not likely 
  have attributed any unlawful purpose to the appellant for coming into possession 
  of the weapon. It was never explained to the jury that the purpose behind his 
  possession at the time he transferred the weapon would suffice to make out the 
  charge. On the basis of the evidence and the instructions they were given, the 
  jury may well have understood, albeit mistakenly so, that the purpose necessary 
  to make out the offence had to relate to the entire time he was in possession 
  of the weapon or that it had to relate to the reason he had it in his possession 
  in the first place. To the extent that the instructions were incomplete on this 
  point, they enured to the benefit of the appellant. However, it does not follow 
  as a matter of law that the convictions on the trafficking and transferring 
  charges must be set aside. </p>
<p>
  [12] Consequently, it is my view that there is a sufficient difference in the 
  legal requirements for the two sets of charges to explain the verdicts. In other 
  words, the jury may have had a doubt on the appellant's purpose for having the 
  gun in his possession while still being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt 
  that he did in fact sell the gun to his cousin knowing that the weapon was a 
  prohibited weapon. </p>
<p>
  [13] I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
