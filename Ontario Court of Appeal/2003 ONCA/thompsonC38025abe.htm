<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the appellant's first two grounds of appeal turn on the question 
  of whether the trial judge was entitled to use the evidence that the appellant 
  had trafficked in cocaine on other occasions in relation to count 3 on the information 
  (the count concerning possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking). 
  We conclude that he was. The evidence was relevant to the appellant's intention 
  to traffic. See R. v. LePage (1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 385 paras. 34-38 and R. 
  v. Handy (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 481 paras. 87-89.</p>
<p>[2] As for the appellant's submission that the Crown's cross-examination was 
  oppressive and prejudicial, the Crown concedes and we agree that the Crown's 
  initial questions were improper. However, viewed in the context of the cross-examination 
  as a whole, they are not sufficient to make the trial unfair.</p>
<p>[3] We did not call on the Crown in relation to any other issues as, in our 
  view, they had no merit.</p>
<p>[4] The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
