<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Nancy M. Mossip of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated November 26, 2001.</p>
<p>ARMSTRONG J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The estate of Michael John MacNeil appeals from the judgment of Justice 
  Nancy M. Mossip of the Superior Court of Justice dated November 26, 2001, in 
  which she awarded damages to the plaintiff, Harvey Thorne, for injuries suffered 
  in a car accident. </p>
<p>Background to the Appeal</p>
<p> [2] Harvey Thorne was a passenger in a car driven by Michael John MacNeil. 
  They were involved in an accident in which MacNeil was killed and Thorne was 
  seriously injured. </p>
<p>[3] Thorne sued the estate of Michael John MacNeil and the owner of the car, 
  John Prets. The Guarantee Company of North America (&#8220;Guarantee Company&#8221;) 
  was added as a third party pursuant to the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8. 
  The Guarantee Company is the insurer of John Prets. </p>
<p>[4] The trial judge decided three issues:</p>
<p class="indent">(i) Who was the owner of the car? There was a dispute on this 
  issue because John Prets and Harvey Thorne were in the midst of completing the 
  sale of the car at the time of the accident.</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) Who was the driver of the car? There were no wit-nesses 
  to the accident.</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) Who was in possession of the car at the time of the accident? 
</p>
<p>[5] The trial judge determined that Prets was the owner of the car, that MacNeil 
  was the driver of the car and that Thorne was a passenger in the car. There 
  is no challenge to these findings on this appeal. </p>
<p>[6] The issue in this appeal concerns the trial judge&#8217;s application of 
  s. 166(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 198 (now s. 192(1) R.S.O. 
  1990, c. H.8) which provides:</p>
<p class="indent">The owner of a motor vehicle is liable for loss or damage sustained 
  by any person by reason of negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle on 
  a highway unless the motor vehicle was without the owner&#8217;s consent in 
  the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffer, and the 
  driver of a motor vehicle not being the owner is liable to the same extent as 
  the owner.</p>
<p>[7] Liability in this case turns on whether Thorne, who had been given unrestricted 
  possession of the car by Prets prior to the accident, was in possession of the 
  car at the time of the accident. If Thorne was in possession of the car at the 
  time of the accident, then s. 166(1) is engaged, Prets is liable, and the Guarantee 
  Company is responsible for the payment of Thorne&#8217;s damages. The trial 
  judge in response to the third issue in paragraph 4 above found that Thorne 
  was not in possession of the car at the time of the accident and therefore the 
  responsibility for the payment of his damages rested with the Motor Vehicle 
  Accident Claims Fund. The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in making 
  this finding. </p>
<p>The Facts</p>
<p> [8] Prets had agreed to sell his car to Thorne. With the consent of Prets, 
  Thorne drove the car prior to the accident but before the sale had been completed. 
  There was some dispute in the evidence as to the period of time during which 
  Thorne drove the car prior to the accident. However, this dispute is not relevant 
  to the issue in this appeal. At no time did Prets give MacNeil express consent 
  to drive the car.</p>
<p>[9] On the evening of the accident, September 28, 1989, Thorne and MacNeil 
  were together in the Acton/Milton area west of Toronto. They drove in Prets&#8217; 
  car. Thorne was the driver. At some point in the evening, MacNeil asked Thorne 
  if he could drive the car and Thorne refused to let him drive. Thorne knew that 
  MacNeil did not have a driver&#8217;s licence.</p>
<p>[10] After Thorne and MacNeil spent some time in a tavern in Milton, Thorne 
  left the tavern and returned to the car, which was located in the tavern parking 
  lot. Thorne was tired and was concerned about driving after drinking several 
  beers. He sat in the passenger side of the car with his feet up. </p>
<p>[11] Within five minutes, MacNeil went to the car. Thorne said to MacNeil, 
  &#8220;give me about an hour, half an hour and come and check me to see if I&#8217;m 
  ready to go.&#8221; As a result, MacNeil went back into the tavern. Thorne turned 
  on the car radio and placed the car keys in the utility tray in the middle of 
  the car. </p>
<p>[12] The next thing Thorne recalled was hearing MacNeil shouting a warning. 
  Thorne was still in the passenger seat and MacNeil was driving the car. The 
  car moved sideways and left the road. MacNeil was killed. Thorne suffered back 
  injuries which required surgery.</p>
<p>The Trial Judgment</p>
<p> [13] The trial judge approached the application of s. 166(1) of the Highway 
  Traffic Act as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">The final legal question I must then answer is as follows: Was 
  the car in MacNeil&#8217;s possession at the time of the accident? In other 
  words, was it no longer in Thorne&#8217;s possession.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no dispute that John Prets had not consented to Michael 
  MacNeil possessing the Horizon. He had consented to Harvey Thorne being in possession 
  of his car. Accordingly, if I answer the above question yes, that is, that the 
  car was in Michael MacNeil&#8217;s possession at the time of the accident, then 
  John Prets as owner and the third party, his insurance company, have a valid 
  defence to the strict liability provisions of s. 166 of the Highway Traffic 
  Act. If I do so find, then the Fund alone, on behalf of Michael MacNeil is solely 
  liable, subject to the issue of contributory negligence, for Harvey&#8217;s 
  damages. </p>
<p class="indent">If I find that Michael MacNeil was not in possession, and accordingly 
  Harvey Thorne was, then John Prets and his insurer are liable for the damages, 
  as Harvey was in possession of the car with the owner&#8217;s consent.</p>
<p>[14] Counsel for the appellant relied, at trial and in this court, on Thompson 
  v. Bourchier, [1933] O.R. 525 (C.A.) in support of his submission that a proper 
  application of s. 166(1) of the Highway Traffic Act would impose liability on 
  Prets as owner of the car. He argued that s. 166(1) is a strict liability provision. 
  He argued that it would be contrary to the purpose of the legislation if the 
  owner of a car could escape liability because he did not give his consent to 
  the person ultimately in control of the car at the time of an accident. </p>
<p>[15] The trial judge distinguished Thompson from the case at bar on the basis 
  that, in Thompson, the person who had been given the consent of the owner was 
  a passenger in the car and he acquiesced (although reluctantly) to someone else 
  driving it at the time of the accident. I agree with the distinction made by 
  the trial judge. </p>
<p>[16] The trial judge made the following finding:</p>
<p class="indent">Specifically, I find that the facts of this case are distinguishable 
  from Thompson v. Bourchier because MacNeil was never driving the car as Thorne&#8217;s 
  guest or with his permission either tacit or otherwise. Harvey who was at the 
  least asleep, and was perhaps in addition impaired by alcohol to some level 
  of unawareness, was incapable himself of exercising possession of a car, and 
  he was not in any position to transfer possession either directly or indirectly 
  to MacNeil.</p>

<p class="center">&#8230;</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, I find that Harvey was not in &#8220;possession&#8221; 
  of the car at the time of the accident. I find that MacNeil was in possession 
  of the vehicle, and he was in possession without Thorne or Prets&#8217; consent 
  and, therefore, Prets is not liable pursuant to s. 166 of the Highway Traffic 
  Act for MacNeil&#8217;s negligence.</p>
<p>[17] The evidence before the trial judge provided ample support for her finding. 
  In my view, Thorne was in possession of the car during the evening. However, 
  MacNeil deprived Thorne of possession by taking control of the car and driving 
  it while Thorne was asleep. He thereby took possession of the car without the 
  consent of either the owner or Thorne. </p>
<p>[18] This court has held previously that the question of whether a motor vehicle 
  was in the possession of some other person without the owner&#8217;s consent 
  is a question of fact to be decided by the evidence in each particular case. 
  See Barham v. Marsden, [1960] O.W.N. 153 at 154 (C.A.); Newman and Newman v. 
  Terdik, [1953] O.R. 1 at 7 (C.A.).</p>
<p>[19] In my view, there is no basis upon which this court could find that the 
  trial judge committed a palpable and overriding error in her conclusion that 
  Thorne was not in possession of the car at the time of the accident. That said, 
  there is no basis upon which this court could interfere with the judgment. See 
  Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. </p>
<p>DISPOSITION</p>
<p> [20] In the result, I would dismiss the appeal. I would award costs to the 
  respondent fixed in the amount of $7,500 inclusive of disbursements and Goods 
  and Services Tax.</p>
