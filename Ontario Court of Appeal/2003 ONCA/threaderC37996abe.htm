<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The summary conviction appeal judge (S.C.A. C.J.) erred by applying a correctness 
  standard in reviewing the trial judge's finding that on the totality of the 
  evidence the officer did not have the requisite grounds to make a s. 254(3) 
  demand.</p>
<p>
  [2] The trial judge's finding cannot be said to be unreasonable. Nor did he 
  misapprehend the evidence or improperly apply the operative legal principles. 
  There was no basis upon which to interfere with the trial judge's ruling.</p>
<p>
  [3] The Crown did not argue s. 24(2) at the trial. In our view the evidence 
  of the breathalyser results would in all likelihood have been excluded if the 
  matter had been argued at trial. As it was not argued, apparently because it 
  was assumed that the evidence would be excluded, it would not be appropriate 
  to order a new trial so that the issue could be litigated for the first time.</p>
<p>
  [4] Leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and the acquittal is restored.</p>
