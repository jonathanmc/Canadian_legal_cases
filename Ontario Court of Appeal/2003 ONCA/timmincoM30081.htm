<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The applicant has not met the test in s. 131 of the Provincial Offences 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 33 for granting leave to appeal to this court. I am 
  not persuaded that it is essential to the public interest or for the due administration 
  of justice that leave be granted.</p>
<p> [2] The summary conviction appeal court judge (the appeal judge) found that 
  the trial judge erred in concluding that the applicant had established that 
  the delay relied upon had caused irremediable prejudice to the applicant's 
  fair trial rights.</p>
<p> [3] In his reasons, the appeal judge pointed out that the trial judge's 
  reasons did not explain how the missing notes could assist the applicant in 
  asserting the defences of due diligence or officially induced error or how the 
  absence of the notes would otherwise prejudice the applicant. The missing notes 
  predated the fatality by some years and there was evidence that the important 
  information from the notes had been transcribed into field reports which are 
  available to the applicant.</p>
<p> [4] I agree with the appeal judge's conclusion that the finding of prejudice 
  by the trial judge was "purely speculative and hypothetical" and 
  that the trial judge erred in finding that prejudice had been established.</p>
<p> [5] Moreover, there was little, if any, evidence linking the alleged prejudice 
  &#8211; the fact that the notes of three Ministry of Labour inspectors were 
  no longer available &#8211; to the undue delay relied upon by the applicant.</p>
<p> [6] The applicant raised a number of complaints about the reasons of the appeal 
  judge. Those complaints, even if valid, do not affect the appeal judge's 
  finding that the applicant had not established irreparable prejudice. That finding 
  is fatal to the applicant's s. 11(b) motion.</p>
<p> [7] Accordingly, the motion for leave to appeal is dismissed. There will be 
  no order as to costs.</p>
