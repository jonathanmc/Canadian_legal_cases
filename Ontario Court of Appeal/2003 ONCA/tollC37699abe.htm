<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] In our view, in light of the unusual endorsement of the Divisional Court 
  on the appeal from the Vendors and Purchasers motion, the question of what the 
  appellant had actually bargained for was still a live issue on the trial of 
  this motion. The trial judge found that the appellant &quot;agreed to purchase 
  the property subject to the lease including the option to purchase.&quot; This 
  finding was open to the trial judge on the evidence, and in light of the explicit 
  notation &quot;encroachment&quot; on the sketch attached to the agreement of 
  purchase and sale, her finding did not contradict the terms of the written agreement. 
  Nor do we read her reasons as resting on the proposition that knowledge of a 
  title defect amounts to waiver of the defect. Accordingly, she properly dismissed 
  the appellants' claims against the vendor and the appeal is dismissed. Cost 
  to the respondent on a partial indemnity basis fixed at $16,000 inclusive of 
  G.S.T.<br>
