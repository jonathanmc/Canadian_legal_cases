<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice Lucien A. Beaulieu of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated January 15, 2001 and from the sentence by Justice Lucien 
  A. Beaulieu dated February 2, 2001.</p> <P>
  CARTHY J.A.:</p> <P>
  [1] The appellant appeals against both conviction and sentence after trial by 
  a jury on two counts of trafficking, two counts of possession of the proceeds 
  of the crime, and three counts of possession of a prohibited weapon.</p> <P>
  [2] The most significant point of appeal concerns the adequacy of response of 
  the trial judge to questions put by the jury. Since I have concluded that a 
  new trial should be ordered, I will restrict the recital of facts to those necessary 
  for an understanding of the issue.</p> <P>
  [3] In the course of a large scale investigation, the O.P.P. hired an undercover 
  operative, Robert Brown. Brown insinuated himself into the confidence of the 
  appellant and then, on Brown's evidence, twice purchased cocaine from the appellant. 
  On each occasion, other officers searched Brown before the encounter, provided 
  him with money, kept him under surveillance, and then searched him after the 
  encounter and retrieved the cocaine. The appellant gave evidence, during which 
  he denied selling cocaine, and provided an alternative explanation for the meetings.</p> <P>
  [4] The jury retired at 1:30 p.m. on the last day of a lengthy trial. They returned 
  at 4:00 p.m., asking for a transcript of the trial. They were told that this 
  was not available, and the trial judge suggested they might address particular 
  issues which concerned them. The jury then returned to ask for the testimony 
  of the surveillance officers. The following interchange occurred:</p> 
<P class="indent"> THE COURT: Yes, Members of the Jury, you have mentioned the 
  police reports and the evidence of all the police.</p>
<P class="indent">Once again, on reflection, that seems to be a pretty difficult 
  and wide order request.</p>
<P class="indent">I would ask you that you return to your jury room and see if 
  you can break it down in terms of specific officers, specific areas, because 
  you will recall that we have the evidence of, when you consider all of the evidence 
  but in particular the surveillance evidence, as I recollect, the evidence of 
  at least seven officers and four main ones or six basically: Deane, Cousens, 
  Pulfrey, Smith and DeLorenzi. So it is pretty hard for anyone to, at this stage, 
  for me or the Reporter to go back and revisit all of that. There must, I would 
  suspect, be something behind your request in terms of some issue regarding possibly 
  one of them in particular, or two or three, or whatever the case may be, but 
  I think you have to identify your questions a little bit more precisely than 
  that. </p>
<P class="indent">THE PRESIDENT: Your Honour, if I may address you.</p>
<P class="indent">So just to focus it a little more, I realize we have made a 
  broad request but the area specifically we are interested in would it be possible 
  even to hear a playback of the testimony given by Mr. Toms on November 10 at 
  the occasion when he met Mr. - Or was told he met Mr. Brown at his house on 
  Miramar?</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: Well, you see that is where it gets real confusing, 
  because now you are requesting a playback of the evidence of the accused, Mr. 
  Toms, which is completely different than your original request.</p>
<P class="indent">THE PRESIDENT: We have had several discussions after we left 
  the room and this is a specific area and if we can have that we would appreciate 
  it.</p>
<P class="indent">THE COURT: I think what you had better do is go back to your 
  jury room and keep on discussing and then hopefully it will refocus a little 
  bit more, because if this just came out as the result of talking since the last 
  time you were here, then obviously there is room for talking. Okay?</p>
<P>
  [5] That brought the time to 4:15 p.m. The next appearance of the jury was at 
  5:50 p.m. when they returned to deliver a verdict of guilty on all charges.</p> <P>
  [6] The trial judge's early efforts to focus the jury on inquiries that he could 
  respond to were understandable, and his ultimate response was no doubt made 
  in anticipation of a follow-up from the jury. However, the plain words he spoke 
  to them comprised a refusal to read back a segment of the appellant's evidence 
  - his only defence. The trial judge expressed his confusion arising from the 
  request, and this may well have reflected the jury's own confusion. In any event, 
  the Supreme Court of Canada has expressed the importance of responding directly 
  to jury's questions. See R. v. W.(D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 at 410-11 (S.C.C.) 
  and R. v. S.(W.D.) (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 6-8 (S.C.C.). Where a request 
  is made to read back evidence, it is the trial judge's duty to identify what 
  the jury wishes to hear and then read it back or provide a transcript. See most 
  recently in this court R. v. A.(J.) (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 528 at 533-34 (Ont. 
  C.A.).</p> <P>
  [7] The defence counsel did nothing to dissuade the trial judge from his responses, 
  but his error cannot detract from the fact that the jury was denied a review 
  of a portion of the appellant's testimony which bore directly upon credibility 
  and, in turn, innocence or guilt. Some or all of the jury members likely had 
  an imperfect understanding of the evidence pertaining to credibility, and yet 
  proceeded very quickly to a finding of guilt. That is a verdict that should 
  not stand no matter the strength of the corroborating evidence.</p> <P>
  [8] Two other issues were raised which may have a bearing on the new trial and 
  are thus deserving of comment.</p> <P>
  [9] On the eve of the first trial date, the appellant served a notice requesting 
  production of all files in the possession of the RCMP or any other police agency 
  relating to the undercover agent's work for the police over a period of about 
  21 years. This was styled as an O'Connor application (R. v. O'Connor (1995), 
  103 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)), seeking documents in the possession of third parties, 
  but was totally unfocused and would span numerous investigations concerning 
  other persons and matters entirely beyond the purview of the present case. The 
  Crown had already supplied considerable information as to the background of 
  Brown, including his criminal record, all of which was used in cross-examination.</p> <P>
  [10] The appellant later revised the form of application to rely upon R. v. 
  Stinchcombe (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), presumably to be relieved of 
  any onus to provide specific grounds for production of specific documents under 
  O'Connor, but the trial judge dealt with it as originally presented and denied 
  relief essentially on the ground that it was a fishing expedition.</p> <P>
  [11] I would not interfere with the trial judge's exercise of discretion. It 
  was a last minute motion seeking to send the Crown in pursuit of files spread 
  across Canada over a 21-year period without any indication that more information 
  would be forthcoming than had already been presented. </p> <P>
  [12] Finally, the appellant complains of prejudicial questions and evidence 
  introduced by the Crown as narrative. The appellant volunteered evidence as 
  to his motorcycle club membership and police surveillance of club members and, 
  given the very clear instruction by the trial judge as to the proper and improper 
  use of such evidence, I cannot conclude that the appellant was prejudiced or 
  received less than a fair trial on that account.</p> <P>
  [13] Accordingly, I would set aside the convictions on the cocaine offences, 
  and the sentences pertaining to them, and direct a new trial. The Crown factum 
  says that the appellant admitted guilt to the weapons charges during the proceedings. 
  There is no reference to this in the appellant's factum. Unless it can be shown 
  that the Crown has erred, the convictions and sentence will stand on the weapons 
  charges.</p>
<P> Released: March 19, 2003 &quot;JJC&quot;</p>
