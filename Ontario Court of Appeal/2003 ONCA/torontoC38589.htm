<p>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court dated February 20, 2002.
  Regional  Senior Justice Robert A. Blair, Justices Gerald F. Day and Clair
  Marchand.</p>
<p>
  MORDEN and SHARPE JJ.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This appeal involves the jurisdiction of the Ontario Municipal Board (&quot;OMB&quot;) 
  to rule on the legality or validity of a municipal by-law and the authority 
  of a municipality to include in its official plan policies designed to ensure 
  an adequate supply of rental housing by limiting the demolition of residential 
  rental properties and the loss of rental units through conversion to condominium 
  ownership.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [2] The City of Toronto's Official Plan Amendment No. 2 (&quot;OPA 2&quot;), 
  approved in April 1999, established a series of policies aimed at preserving, 
  maintaining, and replenishing the supply of rental housing throughout the newly 
  amalgamated City. OPA 2 restricts &quot;the demolition of residential property 
  and the conversion of rental units to condominium, and/or freehold, by discouraging 
  the conversion of rental units to equity cooperative, and by encouraging new 
  rental housing production.&quot; Among the policies included in OPA 2 are restrictions 
  on conversion unless the vacancy rate for rental accommodation exceeds a specified 
  limit and requirements for the replacement of demolished rental units when considering 
  redevelopment applications involving demolition of existing rental properties.</p>
<p>
  [3] Under the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13, these official plan policies 
  become relevant when a proposed development does not conform with the existing 
  zoning restrictions or official plan, and a zoning change or official plan amendment 
  is required. The policies of OPA 2 also apply when an owner seeks to convert 
  rental residential property to condominium ownership. The combined effect of 
  the Condominium Act, 1998, S.O. 1998, c. 19, s. 9 and the Planning Act, s. 51(24), 
  is to require the municipality, when considering a proposed conversion, to have 
  regard to whether the conversion conforms to the official plan.</p>
<p>
  [4] The City adopted OPA 2 because of its concern about the adequacy of the 
  rental housing supply. When OPA 2 was adopted, over 50% of the City's residents 
  depended upon rental housing. The vacancy rate was under 1% and virtually no 
  affordable rental housing was being constructed. OPA 2 continued polices found 
  in the official plans of the former Cities of Toronto, East York, Etobicoke, 
  North York, and York that dealt with the conversion of rental units to condominiums, 
  and of the former Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto's official plan policy 
  that encouraged new rental housing and the preservation and maintenance of existing 
  rental housing.</p>
<p>
  [5] The City of Hamilton intervened before the OMB and the City of Ottawa intervened 
  before the Divisional Court to support the validity of OPA 2. Both intervenors 
  have official plan policies similar to OPA 2 motivated by like concerns for 
  the preservation and enhancement of an adequate supply of rental housing for 
  their residents.</p>
<p>
  [6] The adoption of OPA 2 followed an important change in provincial legislation 
  governing the conversion of rental properties to condominium ownership. In 1986, 
  the province enacted the Rental Housing Protection Act, 1986, S.O. 1986, c. 
  26 (&quot;RHPA&quot;), which required approval for the demolition, conversion, 
  renovation, or severance of rental properties by municipal councils on the basis 
  of certain specified criteria. The municipal approval required by the RHPA was 
  in addition to any approvals that might be required under the Planning Act. 
  Both before and after the enactment of the RHPA, several municipalities, including 
  Toronto, North York, and Scarborough, had official plan policies dealing with 
  the conversion of rental properties to condominiums. The RHPA was repealed and 
  replaced by the new scheme established by the Tenant Protection Act, 1997, S.O. 
  1997, c. 24 (&quot;TPA&quot;), proclaimed in force in June 1998. The TPA introduced 
  a package of protections to individual tenants in the event of demolition, conversion, 
  or repair requiring vacant possession. These protections generally consist of 
  notice, compensation, security of tenure, and rights of first refusal. </p>
<p>
  [7] In June 1999, several property owners, developers, and associations of owners 
  of rental residential property appealed the adoption of OPA 2 to the OMB. On 
  a preliminary motion, decided before it engaged in any review of the planning 
  issues, the OMB ruled that it had jurisdiction to rule on the legality of OPA 
  2. The OMB found that OPA 2 was illegal and invalid on the two grounds: (1) 
  that it falls outside the powers conferred upon the municipality by the Planning 
  Act, and (2) that it conflicts with the Tenant Protection Act.</p>
<p>
  [8] The City of Toronto appealed the OMB's decision to the Divisional Court. 
  The Divisional Court held that the OMB lacked jurisdiction to rule on the legal 
  validity of OPA 2 and that OPA 2 was a valid exercise of the City's authority 
  to enact an official plan. The Divisional Court rejected the argument that OPA 
  2 conflicts with the Tenant Protection Act and accordingly upheld the legality 
  and validity of OPA 2.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellants urge this court to reverse the judgment of the Divisional 
  Court and restore the decision of the OMB ruling that it had jurisdiction to 
  rule on the legal validity of OPA 2 and that OPA 2 is illegal and invalid. The 
  appellants also seek leave to appeal the Divisional Court's award of costs in 
  favour of the respondents.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES</p>
<p class="indent">1. Does the OMB have jurisdiction to rule on the legal validity 
  of OPA 2?<br>
  2. If the OMB does have jurisdiction, what is the appropriate standard of review 
  on appeal from its decision to the Divisional Court?<br>
  3. Does the City of Toronto have the authority to enact OPA 2?<br>
  4. Does OPA 2 conflict with the Tenant Protection Act?<br>
  5. There is also before us a motion by the appellants for leave to appeal the 
  Divisional Court's award of costs against them in favour of the City of Toronto 
  and the City of Hamilton and the amounts of costs fixed and, if leave be granted, 
  an appeal from the award and, alternatively, from the amounts fixed.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  Issue 1: Does the OMB have jurisdiction to rule on the legal validity of OPA 
  2?</p>
<p>
  [10] The facts relating to how this issue came before the OMB are set forth 
  briefly in paragraph 7 above. The notices of appeal to the OMB raised several 
  issues. It is sufficient to say that two of them raised planning policy objections 
  to OPA 2. One of them was based on the objection that OPA 2, wrongly, had retroactive 
  application to existing applications for condominium conversions or rental housing 
  demolitions. The remaining objection was based on the ground that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The policies are in direct contravention of the thrust, direction, spirit and 
  intent of the Tenant Protection Act (TPA), are beyond the City's jurisdiction 
  and are inappropriate, improper and illegal.</p>
<p>
  [11] Goldlist Properties Inc., Kenneth-Sheppard Limited, and A.J. Green Ltd. 
  brought a preliminary motion to the OMB. The notice of motion contains the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Motion deals with the validity of Official Plan Amendment 
  No. 2 of the former Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto and related amendments 
  to the local Official Plans (collectively &quot;OPA 2&quot;). The Motion also 
  addresses the applicability of OPA 2 to certain classes of applications. The 
  Motion will not deal with the merits of OPA 2.</p>
<p class="indent">Specifically the Motion is for: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1. An order that OPA 2 is illegal and beyond the competence of the City to adopt 
  and that consequently the Board has no jurisdiction to approve it regardless 
  of its merits ...</p>
<p>
  [12] The OMB held that it had jurisdiction to entertain the motion and concluded 
  its reasons on the merits of the motion as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In conclusion, the Board orders: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1. that OPA 2 is illegal and invalid and is therefore not approved; ...</p>
<p>
  [13] The most relevant provisions in the Planning Act bearing on the right of 
  appeal to the OMB and its basic powers on an appeal are ss. 17(24) and 17(50) 
  respectively, which read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 17(24) If the plan is exempt from approval, any person or public 
  body may, not later than 20 days after the day that the giving of written notice 
  under subsection (23) is completed, appeal all or part of the decision of council 
  to adopt all or part of the plan to the Municipal Board by filing with the clerk 
  of the municipality a notice of appeal. </p>
<p class="indent">17(50) On an appeal or a transfer, the Municipal Board may approve 
  all or part of the plan as all or part of an official plan, make modifications 
  to all or part of the plan and approve all or part of the plan as modified as 
  an official plan or refuse to approve all or part of the plan.</p>
<p> [14] The following is a brief summary of the reasons of the Divisional Court 
  for concluding that the OMB did not have jurisdiction to decide the motion: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> (1) While the OMB recognized that it did not have a general 
  power to determine the legal validity of by-laws it erred in making exactly 
  such a determination, separately and discretely from a consideration of the 
  planning merits of OPA 2. </p>
<p class="indent">(2) The OMB &quot;erred in concluding that it was 'necessary 
  and incidental' to its determination of whether the by-law should be approved 
  on Planning Act principles, for it to determine the validity of the by-law.&quot; 
</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Related to (2) the OMB erred in reasoning from the Supreme 
  Court of Canada decisions in Cuddy Chicks Ltd. v. Ontario (Labour Relations 
  Board) [1991], 2 S.C.R. 5 and Douglas Kwantlen Faculty Association v. Douglas 
  College, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 570 that it had the power to order that OPA 2 is illegal 
  and invalid. </p>
<p class="indent">(4) [58] The City's competence to adopt Official Plan policies 
  by by-law is not a matter within the OMB's jurisdiction. Its jurisdiction is 
  to approve, modify and approve, or refuse to approve the Official Plan amendment 
  based upon the planning principles underlying the Planning Act. Put another 
  way, neither the Planning Act nor the Ontario Municipal Board Act, nor the Municipal 
  Act, give the OMB a supervisory jurisdiction over the legislative competency 
  of municipalities. The Board is given supervisory jurisdiction, in this context, 
  over their municipal planning competence [emphasis in original]. </p>
<p class="indent">(5) There are legal avenues for challenging the validity of 
  a by-law adopting an official plan: </p>
<p class="indent10">(a) An application under s. 136 of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. M.35 which enables the court to &quot;quash the by-law in whole or 
  in part for illegality&quot;; </p>
<p class="indent10">(b) Section 94(1) of the Ontario Municipal Board Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. O.28 gives the OMB the authority to state a case in writing to the 
  Divisional Court upon any question of law.</p>
<p class="indent">(6) [63] Significantly, however, that Act goes on to specify 
  that the Board's approval is to be withheld where litigation is pending regarding 
  the validity of the by-law in question. Section 57 of the Ontario Municipal 
  Board Act stipulates that:</p>
<p class="indent10">The Board shall not grant or issue any approval or certificate 
  under this or any other general or special Act in respect of any municipal affair 
  or matter, while the same or the validity thereof is called in question in any 
  pending action or proceeding or by which it is sought to quash any by-law of 
  a municipality relating thereto.</p>
<p> [15] In our respectful view, the Divisional Court erred in holding that the 
  OMB lacked jurisdiction to consider whether the by-law adopting OPA 2 was authorized 
  by the Planning Act. Put shortly, we think that the Board necessarily had the 
  jurisdiction to consider whether OPA 2 was an &quot;official plan&quot; within 
  the meaning of the term in the Planning Act before it could consider the document 
  on its planning merits. The OMB, acting under s. 17 of the Planning Act, particularly 
  s. 17(50), had no jurisdiction to approve a document that was not an official 
  plan. We stress that the Board does not have a free-standing jurisdiction, as 
  a court does, to determine that a by-law is invalid. Its power is confined to 
  making decisions necessarily incidental to carrying out its responsibilities 
  under s. 17 of the Planning Act. </p>
<p> [16] Before elaborating upon the foregoing we should deal with a particular 
  attack on the OMB's decision on jurisdiction made by some of the respondents. 
  It is based on the fact that the decision was made on a motion to it and not 
  as part of the appeal under s. 17(24). This argument is supported by the submission 
  that s. 17(45) of the Planning Act establishes the only mechanism relating to 
  summary disposition of a planning issue by way of a motion and that, accordingly, 
  it may be inferred that the Legislature deliberately excluded the power to allow 
  an appeal on a motion. Section 17(45) reads: </p>
<p class="indent"> 17(45) Despite the Statutory Powers Procedure Act and subsection 
  (44), the Municipal Board may dismiss all or part of an appeal without holding 
  a hearing on its own motion or on the motion of any party if</p>
<p class="indent">(a) it is of the opinion that,</p>
<p class="indent10">(i) ) the reasons set out in the notice of appeal do not disclose 
  any apparent land use planning ground upon which the plan or part of the plan 
  that is the subject of the appeal could be approved or refused by the Board,</p>
<p class="indent10">(ii) the appeal is not made in good faith or is frivolous 
  or vexatious, or</p>
<p class="indent10">(iii) the appeal is made only for the purpose of delay;</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) the appellant did not make oral submissions at a public 
  meeting or did not make written submissions to the council before the plan was 
  adopted and, in the opinion of the Board, the appellant does not provide a reasonable 
  explanation for having failed to make a submission;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the appellant has not provided written reasons with respect 
  to an appeal under subsection (24) or (36);</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the appellant has not paid the fee prescribed under the 
  Ontario Municipal Board Act; or </p>
<p class="indent">(e) the appellant has not responded to a request by the Municipal 
  Board for further information within the time specified by the Board. 1996, 
  c. 4, s.9.</p>
<p>
  [17] We think that these arguments are based on an overly technical view of 
  what the Board, in substance, did. As we have said, one of the issues raised 
  on the appeals to the OMB was the question whether OPA 2 was authorized by the 
  Planning Act. It was open to the Board to hold a hearing on this issue first, 
  as part of the appeal, before considering other issues raised. This is in substance 
  what it did. Its decision on this question made it unnecessary for it to go 
  forward with hearing the balance of the appeal. This is a practice that is followed, 
  in appropriate circumstances, in courts in cases where a decision one way on 
  a particular issue is dispositive of the whole proceeding.</p>
<p>
  [18] The Divisional Court held, in effect, that only the courts have jurisdiction 
  to deal with the validity of by-laws and, as is indicated above, referred to 
  an application to quash under s. 136(1) of the Municipal Act and the stating 
  of a case by the OMB under s. 94 of the Ontario Municipal Board Act. These provisions 
  read, respectively: </p>
<p class="indent"> 136. (1) The Superior Court of Justice upon application of 
  a resident of the municipality or of a person interested in a by-law of its 
  council may quash the by-law in whole or in part for illegality.</p>
<p class="indent">94. (1) The Board may, at the request of the Lieutenant Governor 
  in Council, or of its own motion, or upon the application of any party, and 
  upon such security being given as it directs, state a case in writing for the 
  opinion of the Divisional Court upon any question that, in the opinion of the 
  Board, is a question of law.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The Divisional Court shall hear and determine the stated 
  case and remit it to the Board with the opinion of the court thereon.</p>
<p>
  [19] We accept, of course, that these provisions confer jurisdiction on the 
  courts to decide the validity of by-laws. This does not, however, mean that 
  the courts necessarily have the exclusive jurisdiction to consider issues of 
  this nature in the circumstances of a case such as the present one. We shall, 
  shortly, consider this further. </p>
<p>
  [20] As we indicated in paragraph 14(6) above, the Divisional Court also relied 
  upon s. 57 of the Ontario Municipal Board Act to indicate that the Ontario Municipal 
  Board had no jurisdiction to consider whether OPA 2 was an official plan. Section 
  57 is set forth in paragraph 14(6).</p>
<p>
  [21] Section 57 goes no further than providing that in the circumstances mentioned 
  in that section, the Board's approval is to be withheld where litigation is 
  pending regarding the validity of the by-law in question. It does not speak 
  to the case where there is no such litigation. </p>
<p>
  [22] The Divisional Court made no reference to the powers conferred on the Board 
  by the Ontario Municipal Board Act with respect to questions of law. These powers 
  are conferred by s. 35, which we set forth in the context of ss. 34 to 37(a): </p>
<p class="indent">
  34. The Board for all purposes of this Act has all the powers of a court of 
  record and shall have an official seal which shall be judicially noticed.</p>
<p class="indent"> 35. The Board, as to all matters within its jurisdiction under 
  this Act, has authority to hear and determine all questions of law or of fact.</p>
<p class="indent"> 36. The Board has exclusive jurisdiction in all cases and in 
  respect of all matters in which jurisdiction is conferred on it by this Act 
  or by any other general or special Act.</p>
<p class="indent"> 37. The Board has jurisdiction and power,</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) to hear and determine all applications made, proceedings 
  instituted and matters brought before it under this Act or any other general 
  or special Act and for such purpose to make such orders, rules and regulations, 
  give such directions, issue such certificates and otherwise do and perform all 
  such acts, matters, deeds and things, as may be necessary or incidental to the 
  exercise of the powers conferred upon the Board under such Act; &#133;</p>
<p>
  [23] With respect to s. 35, we think it is implicit that one matter within the 
  Board's jurisdiction to decide in a proceeding, for the purpose of carrying 
  out its mandate, is the scope of its jurisdiction in that proceeding. We have 
  indicated that its power in this regard is not exclusive. Nor is it final. We 
  shall, in the next part of these reasons, address the question of the standard 
  of appellate review of the Board's decisions on its own jurisdiction. </p>
<p>
  [24] There are practical reasons supporting this view of the Board's power. 
  One is based on expedition. Waiting for the decision of the Divisional Court 
  on a stated case, or of a court on an application, may involve delay. Also, 
  in cases like the present, the Board has had considerable experience in dealing 
  with official plans and what they typically include or do not include. This 
  would, undoubtedly, be of some assistance in ruling on the outer legal boundaries 
  of what may be included in an official plan. </p>
<p> [25] The recent judgment of this court in Ottawa (City) v. Ontario (Attorney 
  General) (2002), 64 O.R. (3d) 703 is particularly apposite on the question of 
  the OMB's jurisdiction. In Ottawa, the Ontario Energy Board had stated a case 
  for the opinion of the Divisional Court under s. 32 of the Ontario Energy Board 
  Act, S.O. 1998, c. 15, Schedule B, which is substantially the same as s. 94 
  of the Ontario Municipal Board Act. It is not necessary to relate all of the 
  facts in Ottawa. It is sufficient to note that the Divisional Court, on the 
  motion of the Attorney General, quashed the stated case and that one of the 
  reasons for the court's decision was that &quot;the Board stated a case which, 
  in effect, asked if a regulation is valid and has no jurisdiction to do so&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [26] The Divisional Court's full reasons on this issue were as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Thirdly, further, the board has no jurisdiction to state a case asking if a 
  regulation is valid. It has attempted to justify its approach by analogising 
  with respect to two Charter cases: Cuddy Chicks Ltd. v. Ontario (Labour Relations 
  Board), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 5 and Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1996] 
  3 S.C.R. 854 that it is not questioning the validity of the regulation, but 
  rather only whether it has to apply it. The case before us is not a Charter 
  case. In any event this seems to be a distinction without a functional difference. 
  The board's jurisdiction under section 96 of the Ontario Energy Board Act is 
  restricted to determining whether the proposed transmission line is in the public 
  interest. When the board asks this court to determine the &quot;applicability&quot;, 
  but in substance the validity of the regulation, it is exceeding its jurisdiction 
  as a creature of statute. Therefore, the court has no jurisdiction to decide 
  the validity of the regulation within the context of this stated case.</p>
<p> [27] Goudge J.A., for the court, dealt with this issue as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> [37] The third issue is whether the Divisional Court was correct 
  to quash the stated case on the basis that the Board was really asking if O. 
  Reg. 365/00 was valid and had no jurisdiction to state such a case.</p>
<p class="indent">[38] With respect, I think that the Divisional Court erred in 
  characterizing the question posed in the stated case as a request that the Court 
  determine the validity of the regulation. The stated case poses the more limited 
  question of whether the regulation is to be applied by the Board in hearing 
  applications under s. 92 of the Act or whether, as asserted by the appellant, 
  it is inconsistent with the Act and therefore not to be applied.</p>
<p class="indent">[39] The stated case does not seek a determination of whether 
  the regulation is valid for all purposes. It simply asks whether the regulation 
  is effective to determine the boundary of the Board's jurisdiction. In stating 
  the case the Board seeks the assistance of the Divisional Court in defining 
  the Board's jurisdiction in s. 92 applications, following the making of O. Reg. 
  365/00. The question posed is one which the Board could put to itself and equally 
  one it could put to the Divisional Court by way of stated case. As Lamer C.J. 
  said in Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Matsqui Indian Band, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 3 at pp. 
  25-6:</p>
<p class="indent10">[23] It is now settled that while the decisions of administrative 
  tribunals lack the force of res judicata, nevertheless tribunals may embark 
  upon an examination of the boundaries of their jurisdiction. Of course, they 
  must be correct in any determination they make, and courts will generally afford 
  such determinations little deference.</p>
<p class="indent">[40] In short, I think the question posed did not seek to determine 
  the validity of O. Reg. 365/00, but was a question which the Board could state 
  and the Divisional Court had the jurisdiction to answer [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [28] This clearly states that the Ontario Energy Board had jurisdiction to decide 
  the boundaries of its own jurisdiction and, also, could seek the assistance 
  of the Divisional Court on this question. </p>
<p>
  [29] Also, the stated case did not seek a determination of whether the regulation 
  was &quot;valid for all purposes&quot;. Neither, in the present case, should 
  the OMB's decision be regarded as determining the validity of the by-law that 
  adopted the official plan &quot;for all purposes&quot; but, rather, only for 
  the purpose of deciding the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  [30] We further note, as emphasized in paragraph 27 above, that the court said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The question posed is one which the Board could put to itself and equally one 
  it could put to the Divisional Court by way of stated case.</p>
<p>
  [31] In the present case, the respondents submit that, although the OMB could 
  have, indeed, should have, stated a case to the Divisional Court on the question 
  of its jurisdiction, it could not itself decide the question. This is contradicted 
  by the reasons in Ottawa. </p>
<p>
  [32] We think that the foregoing is sufficient to determine the question of 
  the OMB's jurisdiction but, before concluding, we think that we should deal, 
  briefly, with certain earlier decisions of this court that are submitted to 
  be germane to the issue. </p>
<p>
  [33] The first, in time, is Village of Forest Hill v. The Municipality of Metropolitan 
  Toronto, [1958] O.R. 254. We do not think that it resolves the question in favour 
  of the respondents. The court held that a provincial statute that vested judicial 
  power in the Ontario Municipal Board to decide the question of the validity 
  of a by-law, a power that the court found not to be incidental to its administrative 
  function, was unconstitutional. In the present case, the power to decide the 
  question of law is incidental to its power to determine the limits of its jurisdiction 
  in the case before it.</p>
<p>
  [34] The next decision, in time, is Re North York Twp., [1960] O.R. 374. The 
  court in this case, as one of several issues decided, held that the OMB had 
  erred in its interpretation of a provision in the Planning Act, 1955. The decision 
  is much-cited for a statement in the reasons at p. 384 that &quot;the Board 
  has no power to deal with the validity or otherwise of a by-law&quot;. Soon 
  after this, however, the court said at p. 384: </p>
<p class="indent">
  As no by-law passed under the Act became effective until it had received the 
  board's approval it is obvious that quite a wide field was left to the board 
  as to matters which it was entitled to review. Among these, of necessity, must 
  have been a consideration of the intent and purpose of the Act and, so far as 
  this might be a consideration of law, it was nevertheless one which the board 
  was entitled to exercise as incidental to its administrative functions. It is 
  my opinion that the board, notwithstanding its words, sought to do no more than 
  that on this occasion and was acting within its powers [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [35] This appears to draw the distinction between the Board dealing with the 
  validity of a by-law as a free-standing issue, which it cannot do, and making 
  a decision on a question of law as incidental to its administrative functions, 
  which it can do. </p>
<p>
  [36] The other two decisions are Equity Waste Management of Canada v. Halton 
  Hills (Town) (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 321 and Country Pork Ltd. v. Ashfield (Township) 
  (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 529. We do not think that either of them is determinative 
  of the issue of the OMB's jurisdiction in the present case. </p>
<p>
  [37] The appellants submit that the Divisional Court erred in not considering 
  Equity Waste Management, which, they submit, stands for the proposition that, 
  in exercising its jurisdiction to review an interim control by-law, the OMB 
  could decide the question of the legality of the by-law. The main issue before 
  the court was a contest relating to which tribunal, the OMB under s. 38(4) of 
  the Planning Act, or the Superior Court in an application under s. 136(1) of 
  the Municipal Act, had jurisdiction to review the interim control by-law. Laskin 
  J.A., for the court, held that both tribunals had jurisdiction and that, in 
  the circumstances of the case at hand, the judge who heard the application did 
  not err in exercising jurisdiction to deal with the by-law under s. 136(1) of 
  the Municipal Act.</p>
<p>
  [38] The respondents submit that Laskin J.A.'s decision goes no further than 
  holding that the kind of legality of the by-law over which the OMB had jurisdiction 
  was illegality in the form of bad faith related to the planning principles relevant 
  to the case at hand. The appellants submit that the decision stands for the 
  proposition that the Board could consider questions of legality, generally, 
  in exercising its power under s. 38(4) of the Planning Act. To decide the issue 
  before the court, whether the OMB had exclusive jurisdiction to review the interim 
  control by-law, it was not necessary for Laskin J.A. to deal generally with 
  the scope of the Board's jurisdiction and we do not think that Equity Waste 
  Management should be read as dealing with all aspects of this question.</p>
<p>
  [39] The same reasoning applies to the bearing of the judgment in Country Pork. 
  In this case, Borins J.A., for the court, interpreted Equity Waste Management 
  for the purpose of resolving, once again, an issue relating to whether the review 
  of an interim control by-law should be before the OMB under s. 38(4) of the 
  Planning Act or before a judge under s. 136(1) of the Municipal Act. He held 
  that a person attacking an interim control by-law did not have an unfettered 
  choice between an appeal to the OMB and an application to quash the by-law. 
</p>
<p>
  [40] What makes Country Pork relevant for consideration in the present case 
  is Borins J.A.'s reference, at paragraphs 29 to 31 in his reasons, to the reasons 
  of the Divisional Court in the case before us as part of his delineation of 
  the respective spheres of the OMB and the court. He quoted from the Divisional 
  Court's reasons that are set forth in paragraph 14(4) of our reasons respecting 
  the lack of the Board's &quot;supervisory jurisdiction over the legislative 
  competence of municipalities&quot; [emphasis added]. We do not think that his 
  reasons dispose of the issue before this court, which is whether the OMB had 
  jurisdiction, for the purpose of determining its jurisdiction to deal with the 
  appeal under s. 17 of the Planning Act, to decide whether or not the document 
  before it was an official plan.</p>
<p>
  [41] We conclude this part of our reasons with a reference to a passage in the 
  reasons for judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Bell Canada v. Canadian 
  Telephone Employees Assn., [2003] S.C.J. No. 36, which was released after the 
  appeal before us had been heard. It relates to the power of the Canadian Human 
  Rights Tribunal under the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 to 
  determine the validity of guidelines (which were held by the court to be &quot;a 
  form of law, akin to regulations&quot; (paragraph 37)) made by the Canadian 
  Human Rights Commission. In paragraph 47 McLachlin C.J and Bastarache J. said 
  for the court: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Tribunal can, and indeed must, refuse to apply guidelines that it finds 
  to be ultra vires the Commission as contrary to the Commission's enabling legislation, 
  the Act, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Bill of 
  Rights. The Tribunal's power to &quot;decide all questions of law or fact necessary 
  to determining the matter&quot; under s. 50(2) of the Act is clearly a general 
  power to consider questions of law, including questions pertaining to the Charter 
  and the Canadian Bill of Rights: see Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), 
  [1996] 3 S.C.R. 854. No invalid law binds the Tribunal.</p>
<p>
  Issue 2: If the OMB does have jurisdiction, what is the appropriate standard 
  of review on appeal from its decision to the Divisional Court?</p>
<p>
  [42] We have little difficulty in concluding that, even if it could be said 
  that s. 16(1) of the Planning Act (which, as we shall discuss in the next part 
  of these reasons, loosely defines an official plan) is a provision with respect 
  to which the Board could be said to have expertise from the standpoint of planning 
  principles (which would lead to a deferential standard of review), on the matter 
  of the Board interpreting this provision for the purpose of determining the 
  scope of its jurisdiction, the relevant standard of review is correctness. In 
  this regard, we refer to paragraph 27 above, which contains as part of Goudge 
  J.A.'s reasons in Ottawa (City) v. Ontario (Attorney General), a portion of 
  the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Canadian Pacific Limited v. Matsqui 
  Indian Band, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 3 at 25-26.</p>
<p>
  [43] It is even clearer with respect to the Board's decision on the question 
  of whether OPA 2 was in conflict with the Tenant Protection Act, which is issue 
  4 in this appeal, that the standard is correctness. The Board's expertise is 
  not engaged in interpreting a statute of general application.</p>
<p>
  Issue 3: Does the City of Toronto have the authority to enact OPA 2?</p>
<p>
  [44] The Planning Act, s. 16(1)(a) provides that an official plan &quot;shall 
  contain goals, objectives and policies established primarily to manage and direct 
  physical change and the effects on the social, economic and natural environment 
  of the municipality or part of it&#133;&quot; [emphasis added]. Apart from certain 
  procedural matters dealt with in s. 16(1)(b), the Planning Act contains no other 
  statements relating to the contents of an official plan, nor does it contain 
  any other specific provisions defining or limiting what can or must be contained 
  in an official plan.</p>
<p>
  [45] The appellants' central argument is that the conversion of a rental property 
  is not a &quot;physical change&quot; within the meaning of s. 16(1)(a). They 
  submit that OPA 2 focuses on changes in nature of tenure rather than on &quot;physical 
  change&quot; and, because the permitted land use remains the same after conversion, 
  there is no change capable of being reached by an official plan. The municipality, 
  say the appellants, cannot address the social issue of a perceived shortage 
  of affordable rental housing through its official plan absent some actual physical 
  change to which the official plan can attach. While the demolition of a rental 
  building amounts to physical change, the appellants contend that demolition 
  control is dealt with explicitly and exhaustively by s. 33 of the Planning Act.</p>
<p>
  [46] The OMB found that that the City lacked the authority to enact OPA 2 as 
  the power to do so was not expressly conferred by the Planning Act and that 
  &quot;any broad power conferred by the province on a municipality that may on 
  the face appear to be general and vague should not be construed to mean unrestrained 
  and wide power for a municipal council to legislate.&quot; The OMB was strongly 
  influenced by its opinion that OPA 2 essentially reclaimed the same approval 
  powers formerly available to municipalities under the RHPA that had been repealed 
  by the TPA, a point we address as the next issue.</p>
<p>
  [47] The Divisional Court found that the OMB had erred in law in finding that 
  the City lacked the legal authority to adopt OPA 2. Day J., writing for the 
  court on this issue, held that &quot;the enabling provisions of s. 16(1) of 
  the Planning Act, in the spectrum of their broadness, would clearly include 
  the impugned by-law, particularly in light of s. 2(j) of the Planning Act.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [48] For the following reasons, we do not accept the appellants' arguments and 
  affirm the decision of the Divisional Court on this issue. </p>
<p>
  [49] We turn first to the specific wording of s. 16(1)(a) of the Planning Act. 
  By the terms of s. 16(1)(a), an official plan shall deal primarily with physical 
  change. Section 16(1)(a) does not say that the official plan shall only deal 
  with physical change. A second and related point is that s. 16(1)(a) is framed 
  in mandatory terms and specifies what an official plan &quot;shall contain&quot;. 
  Section 16(1)(a) is cast in terms of the minimum requirements for an official 
  plan, not the outside limits. It does not list heads of power or the subjects 
  that may be addressed by the official plan. There are unquestionably limits 
  to what a municipality may include within its official plan, but the wording 
  and scope of s. 16(1)(a) indicate that those limits cannot be determined solely 
  by a literal application of its terms. To determine what may be included in 
  an official plan, as distinct from what must be included by virtue of s. 16(1)(a), 
  reference must be had to the Planning Act as a whole. In this regard, it is 
  important to bear in mind that the purpose of an official plan is to set out 
  a framework of &quot;goals, objectives and policies&quot; to shape and discipline 
  specific operative planning decisions. An official plan rises above the level 
  of detailed regulation and establishes the broad principles that are to govern 
  the municipality's land use planning generally. As explained by Saunders J. 
  in Bele Himmel Investments Ltd. v. City of Mississauga et al. (1982), 13 O.M.B.R. 
  17 at 27: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Official plans are not statutes and should not be construed as such. In growing 
  municipalities such as Mississauga, official plans set out the present policy 
  of the community concerning its future physical, social and economic development.</p>
<p>
  In our view, it is essential to bear in mind this legislative purpose when interpreting 
  scope of authority to adopt an official plan. The permissible scope for an official 
  plan must be sufficient to embrace all matters that the legislature deems relevant 
  for planning purposes.</p>
<p>
  [50] Another significant feature of s. 16(1)(a) is that, contrary to the submission 
  of the appellants, management of &quot;the social, economic and natural environment 
  of the municipality&quot; are explicitly mentioned as necessary elements of 
  the official plan. While this phrase must be read in light of the requirement 
  that the official plan be primarily concerned with the management and direction 
  of physical change, it hardly supports the appellants' contention that the power 
  to enact an official plan must be strictly limited to the purely physical aspects 
  of land use planning. </p>
<p>
  [51] As the Supreme Court of Canada recently reaffirmed, in Bell Express Vu 
  Limited Partnership v. Rex, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559 at paragraph 26, quoting E.A. 
  Driedger, Construction of Statutes, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983) at 
  p. 87 the words of any statute &quot;are to be read in their entire context 
  and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of 
  the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament&quot;. When 
  one moves from the confines of s. 16(1)(a) to the broader context of the Planning 
  Act as a whole, one finds considerable added support for the argument advanced 
  by Toronto and the intervenors for the authority of a municipality to include 
  in its official plan provisions designed to limit or control the conversion 
  or demolition of rental housing.</p>
<p>
  [52] In this regard, s. 1.1 defining the purposes of the Planning Act, s. 2 
  specifying the matters to which municipalities are to have regard when carrying 
  out their duties, and s. 3 dealing with ministerial policy statements are significant. 
  Among the purposes of the Act specified in s. 1.1 are: </p>
<p class="indent"> (b) to provide for a land use planning system led by provincial 
  policy;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) to integrate matters of provincial interest in provincial 
  and municipal planning decisions;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) to recognize the decision-making authority and accountability 
  of municipal councils in planning.</p>
<p>
  [53] This statement of legislative purpose makes it clear that the Act is concerned 
  with the broad policies to govern land use planning and the integration and 
  implementation of provincial interests at the local level through the municipal 
  councils exercising their local authority. In s. 2, the legislature specifies 
  some of the &quot;matters of provincial interest&quot; to which municipalities 
  &quot;shall have regard&quot; and among these are &quot;(j) the adequate provision 
  of a full range of housing.&quot; Section 2 is closely linked to s. 3 which 
  allows the Minister, with the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, 
  to issue policy statements &quot;on matters relating to municipal planning that 
  in the opinion of the Minister are of provincial interest.&quot; The current 
  Provincial Policy Statement (1997) issued under the authority of s. 3 of the 
  Planning Act makes specific reference to the need to plan for a full range of 
  housing: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1.2.1 (c) Provision will be made in all planning jurisdictions for a full range 
  of housing types and densities to meet projected demographic and market requirements 
  of current and future residents of the housing market area by: </p>
<p class="indent">
  c. encouraging housing forms and densities designed to be affordable to moderate 
  and lower income households; ...</p>
<p>Under the heading &quot;Implementation/Interpretation&quot;, the Policy states: </p>
<p class="indent">Nothing in this policy statement is intended to prevent planning authorities 
  from going beyond the minimum standards established in specific policies, in 
  developing official plan policies and when making decisions on planning matters, 
  unless so doing would conflict with any other policy.</p>
<p>
  [54] A ministerial policy statement cannot, of course, confer powers that the 
  legislature has withheld. But here, the legislature has explicitly directed 
  municipalities to pay heed to ministerial policy statements on a broad range 
  of subjects, including the &quot;the adequate provision of a full range of housing&quot;, 
  in the exercise their statutory powers. </p>
<p>
  [55] In our view, given the overall framework of the Act and the purpose of 
  official plans, this specific legislative directive that the municipality should 
  address the adequate provision of a full range of housing provides strong statutory 
  support for the City's authority to adopt OPA 2. The legislature and the Minister 
  have both made it clear that attending to the housing needs of its residents 
  is a matter requiring the attention of the municipality in the exercise of its 
  statutory powers related to land use planning. It follows, in our view, that 
  when defining the planning &quot;goals, objectives and policies&quot; that are 
  to govern its planning decisions, a municipality is entitled to include &quot;goals, 
  objectives and policies&quot; related to ensuring an adequate supply of rental 
  housing. </p>
<p>
  [56] We see no merit in the appellants' submission that the city has no capacity 
  to adopt policies concerning the demolition of buildings beyond those spelled 
  out in s. 33 of the Planning Act dealing with demolition control area by-laws 
  and demolition permits. We see nothing in s. 33 to suggest that it is intended 
  as an exhaustive statement of permissible regulation by the municipality. OPA 
  2 does not create a regulatory regime that competes or conflicts with the specific 
  provisions of s. 33. To the extent OPA 2 deals with the demolition of buildings, 
  it does so from a perspective quite different and distinct from s. 33. </p>
<p>
  [57] We are fortified in our reading of the scope of the City's authority with 
  respect to OPA 2 by recent jurisprudence that has emphasized the importance 
  of enhancing local decision-making and avoiding narrow and technical readings 
  of municipal powers. In 114957 Canada Ltee (Spraytech, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; 
  d'arrosage) v. Hudson (Town), [2001] 2 S.C.R. 241 at paragraph 21, the Supreme 
  Court of Canada stated that the courts should accord municipal powers a liberal 
  and benevolent interpretation, and that only in the clearest of cases should 
  a municipal by-law be held to be ultra vires, and approved the dictum of McLachlin 
  J. in Shell Canada Products Ltd. v. Vancouver (City), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 231 at 
  paragraph 19, &quot;barring clear demonstration that a municipal decision was 
  beyond its powers, courts should not so hold.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [58] We would resolve this issue in favour of the respondent.</p>
<p>
  Issue 4: Does OPA 2 conflict with the Tenant Protection Act?</p>
<p>
  [59] The OMB found that OPA 2 was also invalid on the ground that it conflicts 
  with the TPA. In the OMB's view, OPA 2 is inconsistent with the significant 
  change in provincial policy brought about by the repeal of the RHPA and the 
  enactment of the TPA. The OMB found that &quot;the province has been occupying 
  the legislative field involving residential tenants and tenancy&quot; and that 
  as provincial policy had shifted from the protection of rental units and municipal 
  controls under the RHPA to the protection of the rights of tenants under the 
  TPA, municipalities were precluded from reverting to policies akin to those 
  that formerly existed under the RHPA. The OMB found that OPA 2 &quot;was at 
  cross purpose or in conflict with&quot; the TPA and that &quot;in both timing 
  and content&quot; the impugned policies of OPA 2 &quot;are but a reclaim by 
  the city of the municipal powers that have been otherwise repealed by the Ontario 
  Legislature.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [60] The Divisional Court disagreed and held that the OMB had erred in concluding 
  that that there was an invalidating conflict between OPA 2 and the TPA. Writing 
  for the court on this issue, Day J. relied on statements made by the Minister 
  of Municipal Affairs and Housing upon the introduction of the TPA that municipalities 
  would retain authority to have official plan policies restricting the conversion 
  of rental buildings to condominiums. Day J. followed Spraytech, at paragraphs 
  36 to 39, and applied the &quot;impossibility of dual compliance&quot; test 
  and held that &quot;as a general principle, the mere existence of provincial 
  (or federal) legislation in a given field does not oust municipal prerogatives 
  to regulate the subject matter.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [61] For the reasons that follow, we agree with the conclusion reached by the 
  Divisional Court.</p>
<p>
  [62] By repealing the RHPA and introducing the TPA, the legislature removed 
  the RHPA restrictions on conversion of rental buildings and introduced the TPA 
  scheme of rights for individual tenants. The purpose of the TPA is, as its title 
  suggests, the protection of the rights of tenants, not the enhancement of the 
  rights of property owners or developers. The TPA confers no positive rights 
  on property owners or developers with respect to the conversion or demolition 
  of rental buildings. The TPA is silent on the subject of whether a municipality 
  may, through its planning process, introduce its own regulations or controls 
  in this area. Accordingly, as a simple matter of statutory interpretation, we 
  see nothing in the TPA that precludes the city from including in its official 
  plan policies aimed at restricting the conversion or demolition of rental buildings. 
</p>
<p>
  [63] To the extent that there is any ambiguity on the point, we agree with Day 
  J. that the legislative history was admissible to resolve the issue: see E.A. 
  Driedger &amp; R. Sullivan, Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, 
  4th ed. (Markham: Butterworths, 2002) at 497-500; Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. 
  (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 at paragraph 31 per Iacobucci J.: </p>
<p class="indent">
  ... in my opinion, the use of legislative history as a tool for determining 
  the intention of the legislature is an entirely appropriate exercise and one 
  which has often been employed by this Court (see, e.g., R. v. Vasil, [1981] 
  1 S.C.R. 469, at p. 487; Paul v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 621 at pp. 635, 
  653 and 660).</p>
<p>
  [64] The legislative history is clear that by repealing the RHPA scheme providing 
  for controls at the municipal level and introducing the tenants rights package 
  under the TPA, the government did not intend to limit the capacity of municipalities 
  to adopt official plan policies aimed at protecting the rental properties from 
  conversion. Indeed, the government made it clear that the TPA would not eliminate 
  or limit the authority of municipalities to control conversions of rental properties. 
  On the first reading of the TPA in the legislature, the government's summary 
  stated: &quot;Municipalities maintain the ability to have official plan policies 
  restricting the conversion of a rental building to a condominium.&quot; During 
  the legislative debate (Hansard, 12 May 1997) the Minister of Municipal Affairs 
  and Housing, Al Leach, explicitly stated that the intent of the TPA was not 
  to remove the authority municipalities have with respect to adopting official 
  plan policies restricting the conversion of rental units to condominiums: </p>
<p class="indent">
  ... [W]hile we are changing the Rental Housing Protection Act, we have made 
  no changes whatsoever to the authority of municipalities to adopt official plan 
  policies restricting condominium conversions. Municipalities can still discourage 
  condominium conversions through their official plan policies that exist in the 
  present city of Toronto if they feel a conversion is not in the best interests 
  of their community. </p>
<p>
  [65] More recently (Hansard, 6 April 2000), Brian Coburn, Parliamentary Assistant 
  to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, reiterated this policy on 
  behalf of the Ministry: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Bill 96 [the TPA] allows municipalities to use their official plan policies 
  to manage conversions and demolitions in the best interests of their constituents. 
  Through that planning exercise, they have the ability to forecast and protect 
  their communities and design for future growth.</p>
<p>
  [66] In our view, the appellant's argument that the repeal of the RHPA and the 
  enactment of the TPA reflected a legislative intention to eliminate regulatory 
  authority at the municipal level is flatly contradicted by the legislative history.</p>
<p>
  [67] We also agree with the Divisional Court that the OMB erred by applying 
  the wrong test for determining whether there is a conflict between OPA 2 and 
  the TPA. The OMB rendered its decision prior to the release of the Supreme Court 
  of Canada's judgment in Spraytech. That decision makes it clear that, assuming 
  the matter falls within municipal competence, a municipality is free to establish 
  policies and standards more restrictive that those established by provincial 
  legislation. This means that, contrary to the OMB's decision, by enacting legislation 
  dealing with one aspect of a matter, the legislature does not necessarily pre-empt 
  an otherwise valid municipal by-law dealing with the same matter. Spraytech 
  establishes a strict &quot;impossibility of dual compliance&quot; test, derived 
  from Multiple Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 161, to determine whether 
  there is a conflict between a municipal by-law and provincial legislation. A 
  conflict rendering a by-law invalid arises only when one enactment compels what 
  the other forbids. On this test it is clear that restrictions on conversion 
  or demolition imposed on the owners of rental properties as a result of OPA 
  2 do not conflict with the legal protections afforded tenants under the TPA.</p>
<p>
  [68] Accordingly, we would resolve this issue in favour of the respondent.</p>
<p>
  The Motion for Leave to Appeal Costs</p>
<p>
  [69] The appellants move for leave to appeal the Divisional Court's award of 
  costs against them in favour of the City of Toronto and the City of Hamilton 
  and the amounts of costs fixed and, if leave be granted, appeal from the award 
  and, alternatively, from the amounts fixed. The court fixed the City of Toronto's 
  costs in the amount of $75,000 and the City of Hamilton's costs in the amount 
  of $12,000. In our view, it was appropriate for the Divisional Court to award 
  these costs against the appellants. Further, we do not think that there is a 
  principled basis upon which we can properly interfere with the amounts of the 
  awards. Accordingly, we would not grant leave to appeal.</p>
<p>
  The Costs of this Appeal</p>
<p>
  [70] We think that it is appropriate that the Cities of Toronto, Hamilton and
