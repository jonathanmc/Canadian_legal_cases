<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] We agree with the conclusion of the majority in the Divisional Court that 
  it was patently unreasonable for the arbitrator to find that the new position, 
  even though agreed to be a bargaining unit job, was not covered by the seniority 
  rights protections in the composite collective agreement and was, instead, by 
  default, covered by management rights.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] Appeal dismissed with costs fixed on consent in the amount of $23,000 for 
  the Divisional Court proceedings, the leave application, and the appeal.</p>
