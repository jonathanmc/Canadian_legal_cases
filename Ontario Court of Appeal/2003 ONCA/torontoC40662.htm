<p>On appeal from the decision of Justice J.F. McGarry of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated September 24, 2003.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  Overview</p>
<p>
  [1] On August 20, 2003, a justice of the peace issued six search warrants for 
  various locations linked to the business of Aylmer Meat Packers Inc. (&quot;Aylmer&quot;). 
  The informations sworn to obtain the warrants were identical. The warrants were 
  obtained under the provisions of the Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  P. 33 and related to alleged violations of provincial legislation regulating 
  the slaughter of cattle. The informations were sworn by Roger Weber, an agricultural 
  investigator with the Ministry of Natural Resources. The warrants were executed 
  on August 21 and 22, 2003.</p>
<p>
  [2] On about August 26, 2003, the investigation by the Ministry of Natural Resources 
  into the operation of Aylmer became the subject of widespread media reports. 
  The suitability for human consumption of meat slaughtered and processed by Aylmer 
  became a matter of public concern. </p>
<p>
  [3] On about August 27, 2003, the Ontario Provincial Police commenced a fraud 
  investigation into the business affairs of Aylmer. The officers involved in 
  that investigation were advised that Inspector Weber had applied for and obtained 
  the search warrants described above. </p>
<p>
  [4] On September 2, 2003, the Crown brought an ex parte application in open 
  court in the Ontario Court of Justice for an order sealing the search warrants, 
  the informations used to obtain the warrants and related documents. The Crown 
  claimed that public disclosure of the material could identify a confidential 
  informant and could interfere with the ongoing criminal investigation. </p>
<p>
  [5] Justice Livingstone made an order directing that the warrants and informations 
  were to be sealed along with the affidavit of Detective Sergeant Andre Clelland, 
  dated August 30, 2003 filed in support of the application for a sealing order 
  and a letter, dated September 2, 2003, from Roger Weber indicating that the 
  Ministry of Natural Resources took no objection to the application. The sealing 
  order was to expire December 2, 2003. The Clelland affidavit and Inspector Weber's 
  letter were subsequently made part of the public record on the consent of the 
  Crown. </p>
<p>
  [6] The Toronto Star Newspapers Limited and other media outlets (respondents) 
  brought a motion for certiorari and mandamus in the Superior Court. That application 
  proceeded before McGarry J. on September 15 and 16, 2003. On September 24, 2003, 
  McGarry J. released reasons quashing the sealing order and directing that the 
  documents should be made public except to the extent that the contents of the 
  informations could disclose the identity of a confidential informant. McGarry 
  J. edited one of the informations to delete references to material that could 
  identify the confidential informant and told counsel that the edited version 
  would be made available to the respondents unless the Crown appealed within 
  two days. Although there is some ambiguity in his reasons, counsel agree that 
  the intention was to deny public access to the edited parts of the informations 
  unless and until a court ordered otherwise.</p>
<p>
  [7] The Crown appealed the order of McGarry J. Consequently, the respondents 
  have not seen the information as edited by McGarry J. They have, of course, 
  not seen the original unedited informations. Counsel for the respondents was 
  provided at the hearing before McGarry J. with a summary of the contents of 
  the informations on the undertaking that they would not share that summary with 
  anyone, including their clients. </p>
<p>
  [8] The sealed material filed in this court by the appellant included the edited 
  version of the information prepared by McGarry J. The court also received the 
  original documents from both the Ontario Court of Justice and the Superior Court 
  and read one of the unedited informations. </p>
<p>
  [9] At the conclusion of oral argument in this court on October 10th, the court 
  announced that the Crown's appeal would be allowed to a very limited extent. 
  This court affirmed the order of McGarry J. setting aside the sealing order, 
  and also affirmed his order directing that the informations should be released 
  to the public only after they were edited to avoid disclosure of any information 
  that might identify the confidential informant. This court concluded that two 
  paragraphs in the informations that were not removed by McGarry J., should be 
  deleted before the informations were released to the public. The court advised 
  counsel that reasons for its decision would follow within seven days. These 
  are those reasons.</p>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  [10] There are six warrants for six different locations in issue in this proceeding. 
  Except for the locations referred to, the warrants are identical. As indicated 
  above, the informations sworn in support of these warrants are identical. Each 
  information is one page long and incorporates several appendices. Appendix &quot;C&quot;, 
  entitled &quot;Grounds of Belief&quot; contains the information which the Crown 
  argues should not be in the public domain. Appendix &quot;D&quot; entitled &quot;List 
  of Sources&quot; contains a reference to the confidential informant which the 
  Crown contends should not be in the public domain. Each warrant also consists 
  of a single page and incorporates several appendices, some of which are the 
  same as some of the appendices referred to in the informations. The warrants 
  do not incorporate by reference Appendix &quot;C&quot; or Appendix &quot;D&quot;. 
  </p>
<p>
  [11] In the course of his helpful submissions, Mr. Hutchison, for the Crown, 
  advised that, the Crown would not oppose the release of the search warrants. 
  He also indicated that with two minor exceptions, the Crown would not oppose 
  the release of paragraphs 1 through 22 set out in Appendix &quot;C&quot; to 
  the information. He submitted, however, that the remaining paragraphs of Appendix 
  &quot;C&quot; and Appendix &quot;D&quot; should remain sealed (paragraphs 23 
  to 45). We agree with the concessions made by Mr. Hutchison. </p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  The Standard of Review</p>
<p>
  [12] Usually, relief by way of certiorari is available only where jurisdictional 
  error is established. In Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (1994), 94 
  C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 307 (S.C.C.), the Court accepted that where certiorari was 
  brought to challenge a non-publication order, the Superior Court could intervene 
  if the non-publication order limited Charter rights in an unjustifiable or unauthorized 
  way. Counsel agree Dagenais has application to this case, which involves a sealing 
  order as opposed to a non-publication order. Counsel also agree that Dagenais 
  permits intervention by way of prerogative writ for errors that are not jurisdictional 
  in the strict sense. Counsel disagree, however, as to how far Dagenais departs 
  from jurisdictional error as a precondition to intervention by way of certiorari. 
  The Crown submits that the Dagenais standard is met only if the decision under 
  attack is one that no judicial officer acting reasonably could have made. Mr. 
  Schabas, for the respondents, submits that Dagenais introduces a correctness 
  standard of review. </p>
<p>
  [13] I need not attempt to resolve this controversy. Livingstone J. fell into 
  clear jurisdictional error when she refused to grant a brief adjournment to 
  a representative of the media so that counsel for the media might attend to 
  make representations on the application for a sealing order. The Crown had moved 
  ex parte but in open court for that order. After counsel for the Crown had made 
  his submissions, Livingstone J. adjourned to consider the motion. In the interim, 
  a reporter for the London Free Press managed to find out about the Crown's application 
  for a sealing order and was present when court resumed. He asked for an adjournment 
  so that counsel for the media could attend. Livingstone J. declined the request 
  stating: </p>
<p class="indent">
  With all due respect to Mr. Sher [the newspaper reporter] and I thank him for 
  his attendance this afternoon and being familiar with the Dagenais case which 
  he has alluded to, which case in fact is provided in the material presented 
  by the Crown Attorneys Office, in my view the ruling should be given at this 
  time and if the London Free Press wishes, obviously, to appeal any order of 
  this court, it is free to do so in any forum it chooses.</p>
<p>
  [14] The London Free Press, as a representative of the media, had a clear interest 
  in the subject matter of the proceedings. A brief adjournment could have been 
  allowed to permit counsel to make submissions on behalf of the London Free Press 
  without in any way compromising the secrecy of the documents. The media has 
  an important role to play in applications brought to prohibit public access 
  to court records or to prohibit publication of court proceedings: Dagenais, 
  supra, at pp. 309-11. The potentially positive role of the media is evident 
  in this case. The sealing order granted in the Ontario Court of Justice was 
  beyond what even the Crown now asserts. Had counsel for the media been given 
  an opportunity to make submissions, at a minimum, counsel may have convinced 
  the court that the proposed sealing order was too broad. </p>
<p>
  [15] There was no good reason to deny the London Free Press an opportunity to 
  make submissions. The only reason mentioned by Livingstone J., the availability 
  of an appeal, is irrelevant to the question of whether the London Free Press 
  should have been given an opportunity to be heard and is also wrong in law, 
  since in fact the London Free Press did not have a right of appeal. </p>
<p>
  [16] The failure to allow an interested party an opportunity to be heard constitutes 
  a denial of natural justice and results in a loss of jurisdiction: Forsythe 
  v. The Queen (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 225 at 228-29 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [17] Usually, where a party is denied a right to be heard, the appropriate remedy 
  on certiorari is to quash the challenged decision and remit the matter back 
  to the lower court for a proper hearing. However, as pointed out in Dagenais, 
  supra, at 308, the remedial powers of the Superior Court on a certiorari application 
  involving challenges to non-publication orders and similar orders where Charter 
  rights are engaged should be expanded to coincide with the remedial power under 
  s. 24(1) of the Charter. Section 24(1) certainly allows the Superior Court judge 
  to decide the merits of the sealing order application and make the order which 
  the court concludes should have been made on the initial hearing. I do not understand 
  Mr. Hutchison to have suggested that if this court found jurisdictional error, 
  it should not address the merits of the request for a sealing order. </p>
<p>
  IV</p>
<p>
  The Merits of the Sealing Application</p>
<p>
  [18] Once a search warrant is executed and something has been seized pursuant 
  to that search warrant, the warrant and the information to obtain the warrant 
  are available to the public unless a party seeking a sealing order can demonstrate 
  that public access would subvert the ends of justice: Nova Scotia (Attorney 
  General) v. McIntyre (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 129 at 149 (S.C.C.). The narrow 
  grounds upon which a sealing order may be obtained and the requirement that 
  the sealing order be carefully tailored so as to minimize restriction on public 
  access are demonstrated in s. 487.3 of the Criminal Code, which deals with sealing 
  orders in respect of Criminal Code search warrants. Although that provision 
  does not apply to these search warrants, which were issued under the Provincial 
  Offences Act, the controlling common law principles are identical to those set 
  out in s. 487.3.</p>
<p>
  [19] The importance of freedom of expression, including freedom of the press, 
  is obvious. The significant intrusion on that freedom effected by sealing orders 
  such as the order in issue here cannot be minimized. It is the importance of 
  the freedom infringed by this sealing order and the significance of the contemplated 
  infringement that combine to require that any request seeking an order sealing 
  court documents must be subject to close scrutiny and meet rigorous standards. 
  In R. v. Mentuck, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 442, Iacobucci J. offered a two-step analytical 
  approach to cases involving applications to ban publication or otherwise limit 
  public access to court proceedings. He said at para. 32: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A publication ban should only be ordered when: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) such an order is necessary in order to prevent a serious 
  risk to the proper administration of justice because reasonably alternative 
  measures will not prevent the risk, and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the salutary effects of the publication ban outweigh the 
  deleterious effects on the rights and interests of the parties and the public, 
  including the effects on the right to free expression, the right of the accused 
  to a fair and public trial, and the efficacy of the administration of justice. 
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [20] The two-step approach contemplates first a showing of necessity by the 
  party seeking the sealing order and secondly, a balancing of the positive and 
  negative effects flowing from the requested order. In discussing the necessity 
  component of the analysis, Iacobucci J. said at paras. 34-36: </p>
<p class="indent"> One required element is that the risk in question be a serious 
  one, or, as Lamer C.J. put it at page 878 in Dagenais, a &quot;real and substantial&quot; 
  risk. That is, it must be a risk the reality of which is well grounded in the 
  evidence. It must also be a risk that poses a serious threat to the proper administration 
  of justice. In other words, it is a serious danger sought to be avoided that 
  is required, not a substantial benefit or advantage to the administration of 
  justice sought to be obtained. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">This aspect of the test for common law publication bans requires 
  the judge not only to consider whether reasonable alternatives are available, 
  but also to restrict the order as far as possible without sacrificing the prevention 
  of the risk. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [21] The only evidence placed before the court in support of the sealing application 
  was the affidavit of Detective Sergeant Clelland. In his affidavit, he contended 
  that the sealing order was necessary to preserve the integrity of the ongoing 
  criminal investigation and to protect the anonymity of a confidential informant. 
  He said at para. 13: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I believe based on my involvement in this investigation that the release of 
  the warrants, information to obtain and other documents would interfere with 
  the integrity of the ongoing police investigation and furthermore that public 
  access to the said warrants and the informations to obtain may tend to reveal 
  the identity of a confidential informant.</p>
<p>
  [22] Mr. Hutchison contends that the two grounds advanced by Detective Sergeant 
  Clelland justify non-disclosure of various parts of the informations and that 
  together they justify non-disclosure of paras. 23 through 45 of the informations.</p>
<p>
  [23] In asserting that a sealing order was necessary to preserve the integrity 
  of the ongoing criminal investigation, Detective Sergeant Clelland explained 
  that witness statements should be based on the witness's personal knowledge 
  and should not be tainted by information that the witness gets from outside 
  sources such as the media. Detective Sergeant Clelland expressed concern that 
  if the contents of the informations became public, the accuracy of statements 
  provided by potential witnesses could be tainted by fixing those witnesses with 
  information from sources other than their personal knowledge. He said at para. 
  16 of his affidavit: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is my belief that the release of the details contained in the informations 
  to obtain has the potential to make it more difficult for the Ontario Provincial 
  Police to gather the best evidence in respect of its investigation.</p>
<p>
  [24] In argument, Mr. Hutchison put the same point perhaps a little more bluntly. 
  He suggested that there may well be individuals that the police will want to 
  talk to in the course of the criminal investigation who will be more sympathetic 
  to the potential accused than to the police. He suggested that the police would 
  be at a significant disadvantage in questioning these individuals if they were 
  aware of the contents of the informations used to obtain the search warrant 
  before the police had an opportunity to question them. Mr. Hutchison expressed 
  the concern that some potential witnesses will seek to hide rather than provide 
  the truth. He contends that efforts by individuals to hide the truth will be 
  facilitated if those individuals have access to the detailed facts found in 
  the informations to obtain the warrants.</p>
<p>
  [25] The second reason advanced by Detective Sergeant Clelland in support of 
  the sealing application relates to those parts of the information which refer 
  to material provided by a confidential informant. Detective Sergeant Clelland 
  indicates that the person requested anonymity when the information was supplied 
  and is being treated as a confidential informant by the authorities. Mr. Hutchison 
  submits that these facts justify non-disclosure of any information which runs 
  the risk of revealing the identity of the confidential informant. Mr. Schabas 
  does not take exception to the contention that the identity of a confidential 
  informant must be protected. He has not seen the unedited informations and consequently 
  cannot assist the court as to what part of the informations should be deleted 
  to avoid disclosure of the informant's identity. Mr. Schabas is content to rely 
  on the editing done by McGarry J. </p>
<p>
  [26] I reject the first argument advanced in support of the sealing order. The 
  necessity standard described in Mentuck is a high one. The Crown must demonstrate, 
  based on evidence, viewed through the lens of judicial experience, that absent 
  a sealing order there is a serious risk to the proper administration of justice. 
  No doubt, in a given case, early disclosure of material contained in an information 
  to obtain a search warrant may significantly impair the ability of the police 
  to obtain accurate statements from potential witnesses. Again, in a given case, 
  that impairment may be such as to result in a serious risk to the proper administration 
  of justice. The Crown must, however, demonstrate the risk in a particular case. 
  It is not enough to rely on the general proposition that pre-trial publication 
  of the details of a police investigation risks the tainting of statements taken 
  from potential witnesses. If that general proposition was enough to obtain a 
  sealing order, the presumptive rule would favour secrecy and not openness prior 
  to trial. A general assertion that public disclosure may distract from the ability 
  of the police to get at the truth by tainting a potential witness's statement 
  is no more valid than the equally general and contrary assertion that public 
  disclosure enhances the ability of the police to get at the truth by causing 
  concerned citizens to come forward with valuable information. </p>
<p>
  [27] Detective Sergeant Clelland offers no specific basis for his concern that 
  potential witnesses will be tainted if the contents of the information are revealed. 
  He points to no specific information and to no specific individual. He very 
  candidly acknowledges that disclosure would do no more than &quot;make it more 
  difficult for the Ontario Provincial Police to gather the best evidence in respect 
  of the investigation&quot;. I can accept that the police might have an advantage 
  in questioning some individuals if those individuals were unaware of the details 
  of the police investigation. Fundamental freedoms, like the freedom of expression 
  and freedom of the press, cannot, however, be sacrificed to give the police 
  a &quot;leg up&quot; on an investigation. As Iacobucci J. observed in R. v. 
  Mentuck, supra, at para. 34, access to court documents cannot be denied solely 
  because maintaining the secrecy of those proceedings would give the police an 
  advantage in the conduct of their investigation.</p>
<p> [28] I do accept the Crown's second submission. Disclosure of parts of the 
  information used to obtain the search warrant could reveal the identity of a 
  person who on the material is properly classified as a &quot;confidential informant&quot;. 
  Information that could identify that informant is properly excluded from the 
  public domain. In editing the contents of the information to avoid disclosure 
  of the identity of the confidential informant, the court should proceed with 
  caution. If there is any doubt as to whether disclosure would reveal that identity, 
  disclosure should not be made. In some cases, blanket non-disclosure is required, 
  since it cannot be said with any confidence that disclosure of any kind would 
  not run the risk of revealing the identity of the informant: R. v. Leipert (1997), 
  112 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.). Like McGarry J., the court is satisfied that this 
  information can be edited to exclude any information which could reveal the 
  identity of the confidential informant. Our editing is somewhat more extensive 
  than that done by McGarry J. The following material should be deleted before 
  any of the informations are made part of the public record: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The number referred to at the end of paragraph 32 should be deleted (this 
    deletion was made by McGarry J.).</li>
  <li>All of paragraph 33 should be deleted (McGarry J. did not delete this paragraph).</li>
  <li>Paragraph 34 should be deleted (McGarry J. deleted this paragraph).</li>
  <li>Paragraph 35 should be deleted (McGarry J. did not delete this paragraph).</li>
  <li>The reference to the specific times in paragraph 38 should be deleted (this 
    deletion was made by McGarry J.).</li>
  <li>The reference under the heading &quot;Confidential Informant&quot; in paragraph 
    45 should be deleted (this deletion was made by McGarry J.).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [29] I note that a generic summary of the contents of the deleted paragraphs 
  is found in Detective Sergeant Clelland's affidavit. That affidavit is part 
  of the public record.</p>
<p>
  [30] A copy of one of the informations edited in the manner outlined above will 
  be released to Mr. Hutchison with these reasons. He will have seven days to 
  determine what steps, if any, the Crown proposes to take. If, at the end of 
  seven days, no order has been made by this court or the Supreme Court of Canada 
  continuing the sealing order, a copy of the information as edited by this court 
  will be released to counsel for the respondent and will become part of the public 
  record. </p>
<p>
  [31] The original informations and warrants are to be returned to the Ontario 
  Court of Justice. Copies of the warrants should be made available, if requested. 
  The original informations should be held under seal in the Ontario Court of 
  Justice. Once the information as edited has been released to counsel for the 
  respondents by this court, copies of the edited version may be released by the 
  Ontario Court of Justice. The copy of the information as edited by McGarry J., 
  received under seal by this court, should be returned to the Superior Court 
  and held under seal.</p>
