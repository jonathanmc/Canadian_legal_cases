<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Ellen M. Macdonald of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated November 27, 2002.</p>
<p>
  O'CONNOR A.C.J.O.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The defendant, ING Canada Inc., (&quot;ING&quot;) appeals from a decision 
  of Macdonald J. (the motion judge) dated November 27, 2002 granting a motion 
  pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 to 
  strike certain portions of ING's amended statement of defence. </p>
<p>
  [2] The action involves a claim by Transamerica Life Canada Inc. and Aegon Canada 
  Inc. (collectively &quot;Transamerica&quot;) to recover substantial damages 
  for misrepresentation and breach of warranties and covenants contained in a 
  share purchase agreement (the &quot;agreement&quot;) pursuant to which Transamerica 
  purchased all of the shares of NN Life Insurance Company of Canada (&quot;NN 
  Life&quot;) from ING. Transamerica's complaints relate to alleged problems with 
  the business, operations and systems of NN Life and to NN Life's failure to 
  administer insurance policies and investment products in accordance with the 
  policies' terms. Transamerica claims indemnity for the amounts required to rectify 
  the problems and to compensate policy and unit holders who suffered prejudice 
  as a result of the problems.</p>
<p>
  [3] ING denies that the problems existed and alternatively pleads that if such 
  problems did exist, they were not material and that therefore there was no misrepresentation 
  or breach of any warranty or covenant. In the further alternative, ING pleads 
  that Transamerica breached certain implied duties of good faith and fair dealing 
  (&quot;duties of good faith&quot;) and is, therefore, precluded from asserting 
  its indemnity claims.</p>
<p>
  [4] The portions of the amended statement of defence that were struck can be 
  divided into three categories.</p>
<p>
  [5] First, the motion judge struck pleas alleging that Transamerica had implied 
  duties of good faith requiring it to notify ING before closing if it became 
  aware of the problems that it alleges in its claim and to consult with ING about 
  the remedial actions it took after closing. I have concluded that the motion 
  judge erred in striking those pleas.</p>
<p>
  [6] In addition, the motion judge struck a plea that the agreement should be 
  construed in accordance with the intentions and expectations of the parties. 
  In my view, the motion judge also erred in striking that plea. The intentions 
  and expectations of the parties may be relevant to the interpretation of some 
  provisions in the agreement, including the determination of whether the representations 
  and warranties in issue should be considered &quot;material&quot;, as per the 
  agreement.</p>
<p>
  [7] Finally, the motion judge struck pleas of certain factual matters. ING alleges 
  that, before the closing of the sale of NN Life, Transamerica knew of, or was 
  wilfully blind to, the problems upon which it now relies and it failed to disclose 
  its knowledge of these problems to ING. ING also pleads that after the closing, 
  Transamerica did not consult with or involve ING in its remedial actions. In 
  my view, the motion judge erred in striking the factual pleas from the amended 
  statement of defence. The facts alleged may be relevant to both the pleas that 
  Transamerica owed duties of good faith to ING and to other defences raised by 
  ING in its amended statement of defence. </p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [8] The following outline of facts is based on the pleadings and the agreement 
  which is referred to extensively in the pleadings. </p>
<p>
  (a) The transaction </p>
<p>
  [9] In the fall of 1999, ING put NN Life up for sale. Transamerica, a sophisticated 
  and experienced life insurance company, investigated the possible acquisition 
  of NN Life. Transamerica had the expertise to thoroughly examine the business 
  and operations of NN Life.</p>
<p>
  [10] Commencing in the fall of 1999, Transamerica performed due diligence on 
  all aspects of the business and operations of NN Life. During the course of 
  the due diligence, Transamerica reviewed, or had the opportunity to review, 
  hundreds of documents and had access to the accounting and other systems of 
  NN Life. </p>
<p>
  [11] During the due diligence, Transamerica raised a number of issues that ING 
  considered and addressed. Transamerica and ING entered into the agreement by 
  which Transamerica acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of NN Life. 
  The parties signed the agreement on January 7, 2000 and the sale closed on April 
  12, 2000. It was agreed that information would be exchanged during the period 
  from January 7, 2000 to April 12, 2000 (the &quot;interim period&quot;). </p>
<p>
  [12] During the interim period, ING granted Transamerica wide-ranging access 
  to NN Life, its properties, its books, and its records. Transamerica was also 
  involved in the operation of NN Life. In particular, the agreement provided 
  that during the interim period: </p>
<p class="indent"> a) all material operating decisions in relation to the operation 
  of NN Life were to be made by ING and Transamerica acting jointly; </p>
<p class="indent">b) any profit or loss realized by NN Life after January 1, 2000 
  was to be for the account of Transamerica; </p>
<p class="indent">c) ING and Transamerica were obliged to use all commercially 
  reasonable and diligent efforts to maintain the value and goodwill of NN Life; 
</p>
<p class="indent">d) the parties were to agree to a final purchase price; and 
</p>
<p class="indent">e) ING was obligated to co-operate with Transamerica in arranging 
  meetings and communications with NN Life's agents and distributors with a view 
  to assisting Transamerica to maintain NN Life's goodwill.</p>
<p>
  [13] Throughout the interim period, Transamerica attended the offices of NN 
  Life, met with NN Life employees, questioned them as to practices and procedures 
  of NN Life, and gained a hands-on appreciation for all aspects of the business, 
  operations, and systems of the company. ING co-operated in providing access 
  to the operations of NN Life and in disclosing information.</p>
<p>
  [14] At no time during the due diligence period or the interim period did Transamerica 
  raise concerns about the business, operations, or systems of NN Life which went 
  unaddressed by ING. Nor did Transamerica seek an adjustment of the final price 
  based on the problems it raises in its statement of claim. </p>
<p>
  (b) Statement of claim</p>
<p>
  [15] In its statement of claim, Transamerica claims contractual damages and 
  indemnity from ING for ING's misrepresentations and breaches of warranties and 
  covenants in the agreement. The damages and the resulting indemnity claims arise 
  primarily out of errors and deficiencies in: a) the investment management and 
  accounting systems used by NN Life to perform its investment accounting and 
  valuation functions for the NN Life's family of segregated funds (the &quot;PAM 
  System&quot;) and b) a second accounting system used by NN Life to record policy 
  holder transactions (&quot;CAPS-I-L System&quot;). ING also alleges that NN 
  Life failed to administer its insurance policies in accordance with the policies' 
  terms, failed to file required tax returns, and failed to disclose certain liabilities 
  in the financial statements and records of NN Life.</p>
<p>
  [16] Transamerica alleges that the errors and deficiencies existed in both accounting 
  systems prior to closing, with the result that virtually all of the segregated 
  funds held by NN Life policy holders were incorrectly priced both before and 
  after the closing. It also alleges that NN Life's failure to administer policies 
  in accordance with the policies' terms created substantial contingent liabilities 
  to NN Life policy holders.</p>
<p>
  [17] Transamerica pleads that the circumstances described in the statement of 
  claim constitute several misrepresentations and breaches of warranties and covenants 
  made by ING in the agreement, relating to matters such as the accuracy of the 
  books, records, and financial statements of NN Life and the absence of undisclosed 
  liabilities, changes, and unusual transactions. Many of the alleged misrepresentations 
  and breached warranties and covenants are qualified by a requirement of materiality. 
  </p>
<p>
  [18] In the agreement, ING agreed to indemnify Transamerica on an after-tax 
  basis from any loss suffered as a result of any misrepresentation or breach 
  of warranty made by ING in any closing document. On closing, ING represented 
  in writing that all of the representations and warranties in the agreement were 
  true in all material respects. Subsequent to the closing Transamerica merged 
  NN Life's business with its own.</p>
<p>
  [19] Transamerica pleads that it suffered substantial damages as a result of 
  ING's misrepresentations and breached warranties and covenants, and that it 
  is entitled to be indemnified for those damages. Transamerica includes in its 
  damage claim certain payments it made to unit and policyholders which it alleges 
  were necessary because of the errors and deficiencies in NN Life's systems.</p>
<p>
  (c) The amended statement of defence</p>
<p>
  [20] In its amended statement of defence, ING denies that the errors or deficiencies 
  in NN Life's accounting systems or its books and records existed at the closing 
  date. Alternatively, ING pleads that if such errors did exist, they were not 
  material and did not constitute a misrepresentation or a breach of any warranty 
  in the agreement giving rise to a loss for which ING is contractually liable 
  to indemnify Transamerica. </p>
<p>
  [21] As a further alternative, ING pleads that Transamerica had the opportunity 
  to conduct due diligence during the period prior to the execution of the agreement 
  and to investigate and review all aspects of the business and operations of 
  NN Life. Following the signing of the agreement, Transamerica continued its 
  review of NN Life during the interim period. </p>
<p>
  [22] ING pleads that during the due diligence period and the interim period, 
  Transamerica was aware of or was wilfully blind to the errors now alleged in 
  the statement of claim and that it did not reveal to ING information within 
  its knowledge with respect to the alleged errors. Transamerica first raised 
  the concerns now alleged in the statement of claim sixteen months after closing. 
  </p>
<p>
  [23] ING further alleges that Transamerica failed to consult with ING on the 
  appropriate remedial steps for the alleged errors and, in particular, did not 
  consult ING before making gratuitous payments to certain unit holders in an 
  attempt to address the errors.</p>
<p>
  [24] ING pleads that Transamerica's failures, set out in the previous two paragraphs, 
  preclude Transamerica from relying upon the errors referred to in the statement 
  of claim as a basis for indemnity for two reasons.</p>
<p>
  [25] First, relying upon the combined effect of clauses 5.9 and 5.10 of the 
  agreement, ING pleads that Transamerica had an obligation to give timely notice 
  of its indemnity claim. Transamerica's failure to do so materially prejudiced 
  and caused damage to ING. ING pleads that as a result Transamerica is disentitled 
  to the relief claimed.</p>
<p>
  [26] ING also pleads that Transamerica's failure to disclose the errors before 
  closing and failure to consult with ING about remedial steps after closing, 
  breached implied duties of good faith, thereby disentitling Transamerica to 
  rely on those matters in support of its claim. </p>
<p>
  [27] In addition, ING pleads that the agreement and, in particular, the representations 
  and warranties contained therein, must be construed in accordance with the intentions 
  and expectations of the parties. </p>
<p>
  THE DECISION BELOW</p>
<p>
  [28] Transamerica moved to strike the amended statement of defence under Rules 
  21 and 25 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, supra. The motion judge made an order 
  striking portions of the defence under rule 21.01. Although it is not entirely 
  clear from the reasons, it appears that the motion judge made the order under 
  paragraph (b) of rule 21.01 on the basis that the portions struck did not disclose 
  a reasonable defence. </p>
<p>
  [29] In all, the motion judge struck all or a portion of thirteen paragraphs 
  in the amended statement of defence. The portions that were struck fall into 
  four categories: reliance by ING on implied duties of good faith, references 
  in the pleading to the parties intentions and expectations, pleas of the factual 
  matters referred to in paragraphs 22 and 23 above, and pleas suggesting that 
  Transamerica owed ING a duty of care during the interim period (these were struck 
  from paragraphs 20 and 27 of the amended statement of defence and are not in 
  issue in this appeal).</p>
<p>
  [30] The motion judge concluded that ING's pleas that Transamerica owed it implied 
  duties of good faith were not tenable at law. She held that a duty to bargain 
  in good faith is not recognized in Canada in commercial settings like that found 
  in the present case and that absent a &quot;special relationship&quot; the parties' 
  obligations are governed solely by the express terms of the agreement. </p>
<p>
  [31] The motion judge concluded that the implication of a duty of good faith 
  would have the effect of adding to the obligations contained in the agreement. 
  She attached importance to the &quot;Entire Agreement&quot; and the &quot;No 
  Rights In Addition&quot; clauses in the agreement, respectively clauses 1.5 
  and 5.15. </p>
<p>
  [32] The motion judge also struck several references to the parties' intentions 
  and expectations on the basis that parol evidence of this nature would not be 
  admissible to construe the agreement. She said that there is no suggestion of 
  ambiguity in the terms of the agreement, that the agreement is clear, and that 
  its provisions are &quot;not reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning.&quot; 
  The motion judge concluded that the pleas regarding the intentions and expectations 
  of the parties are not sustainable in law. </p>
<p>
  [33] Finally, the motion judge held that factual references to the failure of 
  Transamerica to express concerns about the accounting systems of NN Life during 
  the due diligence period are irrelevant and should be struck.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [34] ING submits that the motion judge erred in striking: </p>
<p class="indent"> a) the pleas referring to implied duties of good faith;</p>
<p class="indent">b) references to the parties' intentions and expectations; and</p>
<p class="indent">c) the factual pleas referred to in paragraphs 22 and 23 above.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (a) Motions under rule 21.01</p>
<p>
  [35] The relevant parts of rule 21.01 read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 21.01(1) A party may move before a judge, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) for the determination, before trial, of a question of law 
  raised by a pleading in an action where the determination of the question may 
  dispose of all or part of the action, substantially shorten the trial or result 
  in a substantial saving of costs; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) to strike out a pleading on the ground that it discloses 
  no reasonable cause of action or defence &#133;.</p>
<p>
  [36] The test on a motion to strike a pleading is well-settled. When the motion 
  is brought under rule 21.01(1)(b), the essential question is whether it is plain 
  and obvious that the pleadings disclose no reasonable cause of action or defence: 
  Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959.</p>
<p>
  [37] The &quot;plain and obvious&quot; test is also applicable to motions brought 
  under rule 21.01(1)(a): MacDonald v. Ontario Hydro (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 529 
  (Gen. Div.). </p>
<p>
  [38] On a motion to strike a pleading, the court must take the facts alleged 
  in the challenged pleading as true unless they are patently ridiculous or incapable 
  of proof. The court should read the pleading generously, making allowances for 
  drafting deficiencies: Hunt, supra; Nash v. Ontario (1995), 27 O.R. (3d) 1 at 
  6 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [39] On a pleadings motion, a court should not dispose of matters of law that 
  are not settled in the jurisprudence. Where the law in a particular area can 
  be described as &quot;muddy&quot;, the court will not strike that part of the 
  pleading, nor hold that the claim or defence must fail: Nash, supra.</p>
<p>
  [40] ING concedes that the motion judge correctly articulated the law regarding 
  motions to strike pleadings. It argues, however, that she erred in the manner 
  in which she applied the law to those portions of the amended statement of defence 
  discussed in the next three sections of these reasons. </p>
<p>
  (b) Issue # 1: The Duty of Good Faith</p>
<p>
  [41] ING argues that the motion judge erred in concluding that its pleas regarding 
  Transamerica's implied duties of good faith are not tenable at law. </p>
<p>
  [42] The primary duty of good faith pleaded by ING is found in paragraphs 10(b), 
  11, 17, and 18 of the amended statement of defence. ING pleads that Transamerica 
  had a duty to disclose facts which came to its attention during the due diligence 
  and interim periods that might adversely affect or prejudice ING's position. 
  In oral argument, counsel for ING narrowed this pleas to a duty to disclose 
  only during the Interim Period.</p>
<p>
  [43] ING pleads that, before closing, Transamerica knew of, or was wilfully 
  blind to, the facts that it now alleges constitute misrepresentations and breached 
  warranties. Despite this knowledge, it closed the purchase without seeking a 
  final price adjustment as it could have done under clauses 2.4 and 2.5 of the 
  agreement. </p>
<p>
  [44] ING argues that Transamerica should not now be permitted to recover damages 
  for matters that could have given rise to a price adjustment, thereby by-passing 
  the price adjustment scheme set in the agreement. Hence, the court should imply 
  into the agreement a duty of good faith which required Transamerica to disclose 
  the complaints on which it now relies, prior to closing so as to prevent Transamerica 
  from defeating one of the objectives of the agreement. </p>
<p>
  [45] ING points out that obligations of good faith in the performance and enforcement 
  of contracts have been recognized in a number of cases in Canada, including 
  GATX Corp. v. Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc. (1996), 27 B.L.R. (2d) 251 (Ont. Ct. 
  Gen. Div.); Greenberg v. Meffert et al. (1985), 50 O.R. (2d) 755 (C.A.); LeMesurier 
  et al. v. Andrus (1986), 54 O.R. (2d) 1 (C.A.); MDS Health Group Ltd. v. King 
  Street Medical Arts Centre Ltd. (1994), 12 B.L.R. (2d) 209; Gateway Realty Ltd. 
  v. Arton Holdings Ltd. and LaHave Developments Ltd. (No. 3) (1991), 106 N.S.R. 
  (2d) 180 (S.C. (T.D.)), aff'd (1992), 112 N.S.R. (2d) 180 (C.A.). ING submits 
  that the existence of a doctrine of implied duties of good faith is settled 
  and that the only uncertainty concerns the ambit of the principles that apply 
  to the duty. That being the case, ING says the jurisprudence is at a minimum 
  &quot;muddy&quot; and as a result, the pleas in the amended statement of defence 
  that rely on a duty of good faith should not have been struck on a pleadings 
  motion. </p>
<p>
  [46] In response, Transamerica says that under the law of Ontario there is no 
  generalized overarching duty of good faith to be implied into all contracts. 
  Rather, Transamerica submits that the requirement to exercise contractual rights 
  of good faith is recognized only in certain categories of relationships, none 
  of which apply here. Those categories of relationships are found in agreements 
  relating to employment and franchises, agreements containing rights of first 
  refusal, agreements that empower a party to act in its &quot;sole discretion&quot; 
  and to use its &quot;best efforts&quot;, and in contractual arrangements where 
  there is a power imbalance or a disparity of information between the parties, 
  such as insurance or condominium purchase transactions: Peel Condominium Corp. 
  No. 505 v. Cam-Valley Homes Ltd. (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 1 at 30-34 (C.A.); 978011 
  Ontario Ltd. v. Cornell Engineering Co. (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 783 at 793-795 
  (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 315 (QL); Marshall 
  v. Bernard Place Corp. (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 97 at 101 (C.A.). Thus, Transamerica 
  says that the motion judge correctly struck references to a duty of good faith 
  in the amended statement of defence.</p>
<p>
  [47] Transamerica also argues the Canadian courts have not recognized a stand?alone 
  duty of good faith that is independent from the expressed terms in a contract. 
  The duty that ING pleads is not a duty that applies to the performance or the 
  enforcement of the agreement. Rather, it is a duty that is in addition to the 
  specific terms of the agreement and a duty that conflicts with the &quot;Entire 
  Agreement&quot; and the &quot;No Rights In Addition&quot; clauses in the agreement.</p>
<p>
  [48] Transamerica submits that the jurisprudence is settled and that the motion 
  judge properly found that the duty of good faith pleaded is not tenable at law.</p>
<p>
  [49] In my view, the motion judge erred in striking the pleas set out in paragraphs 
  10(b), 11, 17, and 18 of the amended statement of defence. </p>
<p>
  [50] The comments that follow are intended to apply only to the implication 
  of duties of good faith into commercial contracts, and not to contracts involving 
  other areas of the law.</p>
<p>
  [51] It is fair to say that Canadian courts have proceeded cautiously in recognizing 
  duties of good faith in the performance and enforcement of contracts. Interestingly, 
  when Canadian courts have referred to duties of good faith, they have done so 
  in circumstances where the result of the case has been determined by the application 
  of other, more established, legal principles. In a helpful article, Professor 
  John McCamus describes the somewhat tenuous judicial underpinnings of the doctrine 
  of good faith duties in Canadian jurisprudence and the cautious approach adopted 
  by Canadian courts to the implication of duties of good faith as a separate 
  doctrine in contract law. See John D. McCamus, &quot;The Duty of Good Faith 
  Contractual Performance at Common Law&quot; (Paper presented to the N.J.I.: 
  Civil Law Seminar, Contract Law: From Form to Remedies, Osgoode Hall Law School, 
  17 May 2000) [unpublished].</p>
<p>
  [52] Unlike the situation in the United States where the duty of good faith 
  in the performance of enforcement of commercial contracts has been broadly recognized, 
  Canadian courts have not developed a comprehensive and principled approach to 
  the implication of duties of good faith in commercial contracts. As Professor 
  McCamus points out, many questions about the nature and scope of such duties 
  have yet to be resolved. Indeed, it remains an open question whether implied 
  duties of good faith add anything to the other available common law doctrines 
  that apply to contracts. </p>
<p>
  [53] I agree with Transamerica that Canadian courts have not recognized a stand?alone 
  duty of good faith that is independent from the terms expressed in a contract 
  or from the objectives that emerge from those provisions. The implication of 
  a duty of good faith has not gone so far as to create new, unbargained?for, 
  rights and obligations. Nor has it been used to alter the express terms of the 
  contract reached by the parties. Rather, courts have implied a duty of good 
  faith with a view to securing the performance and enforcement of the contract 
  made by the parties, or as it is sometimes put, to ensure that parties do not 
  act in a way that eviscerates or defeats the objectives of the agreement that 
  they have entered into: see GATX, supra; Greenberg, supra; Gateway Realty, supra. 
  </p>
<p>
  [54] That said, it must be kept in mind that this issue comes before the court 
  on a pleadings motion. As such, the facts pleaded must be taken as established 
  and a decision to strike the pleading must only be made when the applicable 
  law is settled in the jurisprudence.</p>
<p>
  [55] The duty of good faith pleaded by ING in paragraphs 10(b), 11, 17, and 
  18 asserts that Transamerica had a duty to disclose facts, which it learned 
  before closing, that might adversely affect or prejudice ING. ING's position 
  is that it is necessary to imply such a duty in order to prevent Transamerica 
  from ignoring the price adjustment procedure set out in the agreement, opting 
  instead to recover the damages claimed in this action. Accepting the facts as 
  pleaded, it is at least arguable that if Transamerica is permitted to recover 
  the damages now claimed, one of the objectives of the agreement - namely that 
  the parties would use the price adjustment mechanism in the agreement to address 
  claims of the kind now asserted - would be defeated. Such a duty, if implied, 
  would not be independent of or unconnected to the bargained for agreement but 
  rather would be directed at preventing Transamerica from defeating one of the 
  objectives of its agreement with ING. </p>
<p>
  [56] I hasten to add that as a matter of law the implication of the duty of 
  good faith pleaded in paragraphs 10(b), 11, 17, and 18, is far from certain. 
  Transamerica makes several arguments that point away from the implication of 
  such a duty, not the least of which is the inclusion by the parties of the &quot;Entire 
  Agreement&quot; and the &quot;No Additional Rights&quot; clauses in the agreement. 
  Those clauses may well prove to be a complete answer to ING's plea that a court 
  should imply a duty of good faith into the agreement. However, I am not persuaded 
  that, in this case, the pleading stage is the appropriate stage in which to 
  finally determine that the duty of good faith pleaded is unavailable. Two matters 
  lead me to conclude that the resolution of this issue should await the trial.</p>
<p>
  [57] First, ING has pleaded that the duty of good faith alleged is consistent 
  with the intentions and expectations of the parties and with commercially reasonable 
  standards of conduct. Not surprisingly, Transamerica argues that evidence regarding 
  these matters is inadmissible and should play no role in either construing or 
  interpreting the provisions of the agreement or in determining whether the agreement 
  should include terms other than those expressly set out by the parties. However, 
  given the complex and sophisticated nature of the agreement and the extensive 
  dealings between the parties before the closing of the transaction, the issue 
  of the admissibility of this type of evidence is better left to the trial. At 
  the pleadings stage, it is premature to determine what evidence may or may not 
  be admissible at trial and, if admissible, for what purpose. If evidence relating 
  to the intentions and expectations of the parties and the commercially reasonable 
  practices were to be admitted, it could have a bearing on a court's decision 
  whether to imply the duty of good faith as pleaded in paragraphs 10(b), 11, 
  17, and 18 of the amended statement of defence. </p>
<p>
  [58] Second, striking the duty of good faith pleaded in paragraphs 10(b), 11, 
  17, and 18 at this point would require, at a minimum, a very detailed review 
  of the agreement and the objectives of its contractual scheme. It would also 
  require analysis as to how those objectives may be affected by the duty of good 
  faith that ING seeks to have implied into the agreement. I recognize that the 
  agreement was referred to in the pleadings and that a court can, therefore, 
  have regard to its terms on a pleadings motion. However, it is my view that, 
  in this case, the detailed analysis required to finally determine the issue 
  of whether to imply a good faith duty is better left for a trial.</p>
<p>
  [59] Accordingly, I am of the view that the motion judge should not have struck 
  the pleas of a duty of good faith in paragraphs 10(b), 11, 17, and 18 of the 
  amended statement of defence. </p>
<p>
  [60] The second duty of good faith pleaded by ING is found in paragraph 29 of 
  the amended statement of defence, which reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  29. Further, if errors or deficiencies existed as at or after the date of Closing, 
  which is denied, Transamerica owed ING a duty of good faith and fair dealing 
  under the Share Purchase Agreement, to give ING due and prompt notice of the 
  alleged errors, and to consult ING on appropriate remedial steps.&#133; </p>
<p>[61] Although not entirely clear, it appears that the duty pleaded in paragraph 
  29 is tied to the performance of the agreement. Under clause 5.9 of the agreement, 
  the party making a claim for indemnity for misrepresentation or breach of any 
  warranty or covenant is required to give written notice no later than thirty 
  days after the party becomes aware of the claim. The party receiving notice 
  is given thirty days in which to respond. </p>
<p>
  [62] Under clause 5.10, failure to give timely notice does not affect the party's 
  right to indemnity unless, inter alia, the party entitled to notice was &quot;materially 
  prejudiced or damaged as a result of such failure.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [63] The plea of duty of good faith in paragraph 29 may relate to the performance 
  of clauses 5.9 and 5.10 and as such should not be struck in a pleadings motion. 
  </p>
<p>
  [64] Finally, in paragraph 10(a) of the amended statement of defence, ING pleads 
  a general duty that Transamerica would act fairly in all its dealings with ING 
  throughout the interim period and beyond. The amended statement of defence gives 
  no specifics about what is entailed in the general duty referred to in paragraph 
  10(a). The plea is vague and is not tied to the performance or enforcement of 
  the provisions in the agreement. Nor is it linked to any alleged actions by 
  Transamerica that would defeat any of the contractual objectives. Indeed, ING 
  does not allege a breach of the general duty of good faith in paragraph 10(a). 
  In my view, the motion judge properly struck that plea. </p>
<p>
  (c) Issue #2: Intentions and Expectations</p>
<p>
  [65] ING alleges that the motion judge erred in striking references in the amended 
  statement of defence to the intentions and expectations of the parties. The 
  first reference is in paragraph 9 which reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Furthermore, the Share Purchase Agreement, and the representations and warranties 
  contained therein, must be construed in accordance with the intentions and expectations 
  of the parties that were understood and shared by ING and Transamerica at the 
  time the Share Purchase Agreement was executed.</p>
<p>[66] In my view, the motion judge erred in striking paragraph 9. Many of the 
  representations and warranties relied upon by Transamerica in asserting its 
  claim were qualified by a requirement for materiality. The issue of what is 
  material and what is not will likely be an important issue at trial. </p>
<p>
  [67] Materiality is not defined in the agreement. It will be for the trial judge 
  to determine what evidence, if any, is relevant and admissible in order to determine 
  what is material. The question of whether the intentions and expectations of 
  the parties are relevant to this determination is properly left to the trial 
  judge and should not be determined on a pleadings motion. </p>
<p>
  [68] In addition, it may be necessary for the trial judge to determine whether 
  the failure to give notice under clause 5.9 &quot;materially prejudiced or damaged&quot; 
  ING within the meaning of clause 5.10. Again, in determining this issue, the 
  trial judge may consider it appropriate to look to the intentions and expectations 
  of the parties.</p>
<p>
  [69] In paragraphs 10(b), 11, and 17 of the amended statement of defence, ING 
  refers to the intentions and expectations of the parties in support of its pleas 
  that there should be an implied duty of good faith in the performance of the 
  agreement. Given my conclusion that some of the pleas of duties of good faith 
  should be permitted to stand, I do not consider that the references to the parties' 
  intentions and expectations in paragraphs 10(b), 11, and 17 should have been 
  struck. </p>
<p>
  [70] Finally, there is a reference to the intentions and expectations of the 
  parties in paragraph 13 of the amended statement of defence relating to the 
  establishment of a steering committee during the interim period. The creation 
  of the steering committee is part of the narrative or background that gives 
  context to the events at issue. The reference to the intentions and expectations 
  of the parties is innocuous and I see no reason to strike this reference.</p>
<p>
  (d) Issue #3: Factual Pleas</p>
<p>
  [71] ING argues that the motion judge erred in striking a number of pleas asserting 
  facts. Under rule 25.11, a court may strike pleas of facts that are clearly 
  not relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings. Rule 25.11 reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> The court may strike out or expunge all or part of a pleading 
  or other document, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that the pleading 
  or other document,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) may prejudice or delay the fair trial of the action;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) is an abuse of the process of the court.</p>
<p>
  [72] The impugned facts are asserted in a support of a plea that Transamerica 
  breached an implied duty of good faith. Since I conclude that it is open to 
  ING to plead the duty of good faith, the facts relevant to that plea should 
  not be struck.</p>
<p>
  [73] The first factual plea struck by the motion judge is found in paragraph 
  17 of the amended statement of defence. In that paragraph, ING pleads as a fact 
  that Transamerica was aware of or was wilfully blind to the errors now relied 
  on and that it did not reveal the existence of such errors to ING before closing. 
  </p>
<p>
  [74] The impugned facts in paragraph 17 may also be relevant to the plea that 
  the errors alleged by Transamerica were not material and, therefore, did not 
  amount to a breach of representation or warranty. ING may argue that Transamerica's 
  knowledge of the errors before closing and failure to seek a price adjustment 
  are evidence that Transamerica considered such errors to be immaterial. </p>
<p>
  [75] In addition, the facts pleaded in paragraph 17 may be relevant to ING's 
  plea that Transamerica breached the obligation to give timely notice of its 
  claim under clause 5.9 of the agreement and that such failures materially prejudiced 
  and caused damage to ING within clause 5.10.</p>
<p>
  [76] Transamerica argues that the reference to wilful blindness in paragraph 
  17 was properly struck because it suggests that Transamerica owed ING a duty 
  of care, prior to closing, to discover the problems now relied upon; a duty 
  which ING says is not tenable since it did not appear in the agreement. I do 
  not accept this argument. </p>
<p>
  [77] The reference to wilful blindness is a factual plea, nothing more. It is 
  a plea that Transamerica had constructive knowledge of the problems before closing. 
  It is not a plea that Transamerica owed a duty of care to ING to discover those 
  problems. It is premature at the pleading stage to determine what significance, 
  if any, a finding that Transamerica was wilfully blind during the due diligence 
  or interim periods may have on the issues raised by the amended statement of 
  defence.</p>
<p>
  [78] For the same reasons that apply to the facts asserted in paragraph 17 of 
  the amended statement of defence, I am satisfied that the factual allegations 
  contained in paragraphs 24 and 25 - that Transamerica did not express concerns 
  about the PAM or the CAPS-I-L systems until 16 months after closing - should 
  not have been struck.</p>
<p>
  [79] The motion judge also struck a factual allegation in paragraph 30 of the 
  amended statement of defence. In that paragraph, ING pleads that Transamerica 
  did not consult ING before making certain gratuitous payments to unit holders, 
  thereby incurring unnecessary losses. Those facts may be relevant to the plea 
  of the duty of good faith found in paragraph 29 of the amended statement of 
  defence. </p>
<p>
  [80] In addition, the factual assertion that Transamerica failed to consult 
  may be relevant to ING's plea that Transamerica failed to mitigate its damages. 
  Accordingly, the factual assertion in paragraph 30 should not have been struck. 
  </p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [81] ING did not argue that the motion judge erred in striking the portions 
  of paragraphs 20 and 27 or the amended statement of defence, which are referred 
  to in subparagraphs 1(g) and 1(j) of her order.</p>
<p> [82] In summary, I would allow the appeal and vary the order of the court 
  below by deleting all of the subparagraphs of paragraph 1 of that order other 
  than: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Subparagraph 1(b) as it relates to paragraph 10(a) of the statement of defence</li>
  <li>Subparagraph 1(g) </li>
  <li>Subparagraph 1(j)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [83] As ING has been largely successful on the appeal I would direct Transamerica 
  pay to ING its costs of this appeal and the costs of the motion below on a partial 
  indemnity scale. I would fix the costs of this appeal in the amount of $15,000 
  inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements. </p>
<p>
  Signed: &quot;Dennis O'Connor A.C.J.O."<br>
  "I agree Robert J. Sharpe J.A.&quot;</p>
<p>LASKIN J.A. (Dissenting in part): </p>
<p>
  [84] I have had the benefit of reading the draft reasons of O'Connor A.C.J.O. 
  I agree with him that the following parts of ING's amended statement of defence 
  should be permitted to stand: </p>
<p class="indent"> i) ING's pleading about the parties' intentions and expectations 
  in paragraphs 9 and 13. As O'Connor A.C.J.O. said, this pleading may bear on 
  the meaning of materiality;</p>
<p class="indent">ii) ING's plea of &quot;wilful blindness&quot; in paragraph 
  17 and its &quot;factual pleas&quot; in paragraphs 24, 25 and 30;</p>
<p class="indent">iii) ING's pleading in paragraph 29.</p>
<p>
  [85] I take a different view, however, on the main issue in this appeal: whether 
  ING should be permitted to maintain its pleading that Transamerica owed it an 
  implied duty of good faith and fair dealing during the Interim Period. In my 
  opinion, the motions judge correctly concluded it was &quot;plain and obvious&quot; 
  that this defence could not succeed. </p>
<p>
  [86] The way that ING seeks to use its pleading of an implied duty of good faith 
  is critical for me. Had ING meant only that Transamerica was obliged to carry 
  out its contractual obligations in good faith, on the plain and obvious test 
  I would have allowed its pleading to stand. This is why, like O'Connor A.C.J.O., 
  I would not strike ING's pleading in paragraph 29 that Transamerica owed a good 
  faith obligation to give prompt notice of any errors at or after closing. </p>
<p>
  [87] Although I doubt paragraph 29 has much merit or adds anything to ING's 
  defence in the light of other provisions in the agreement (which I will discuss), 
  I would not strike it on a pleadings motion. I would not do so because in a 
  variety of settings, this court and other courts have used the doctrine of good 
  faith to police the bargain the parties have already made and to supervise performance 
  of their contractual obligations. Even where good faith is not pleaded, in many 
  contexts courts have held that one contracting party owes the other an implied 
  duty to carry out its obligations or to exercise any discretion given by the 
  contract in good faith. See for example 978011 Ontario Ltd. v. Cornell Engineering 
  Co. (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 783 (C.A.). The pleading of good faith in paragraph 
  29 relates to the performance of Transamerica's timely notice obligation under 
  Articles 5.9 and 5.10 of the share purchase agreement. It is therefore supportable. 
  </p>
<p>
  [88] But ING also seeks to use good faith for an entirely difference purpose 
  and it is this other purpose I find objectionable. ING asserts an implied duty 
  of good faith not just to police performance of an existing obligation but also 
  to add a substantive term to the parties' express bargain. It seeks to use good 
  faith to add to the contractual obligations expressly agreed to by Transamerica. 
  This can be seen most clearly by ING's pleading in paragraphs 10(b) and 17 of 
  its amended statement of defence: </p>
<p class="indent">
  10. The intentions and expectations of the parties were as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> a) that Transamerica and its Advisors would act in good faith, 
  and would act fairly in all of their dealings with ING throughout the Interim 
  Period and beyond; and</p>
<p class="indent">b) that Transamerica would disclose to ING all facts that came 
  to its attention, or the attention of its Advisors, during the Due Diligence 
  period and the Interim Period which might adversely affect or prejudice ING's 
  position.</p>
<p class="indent">. . .</p>
<p class="indent">17. In the further alternative, if errors existed, and if such 
  errors were material, which is denied, ING pleads that Transamerica was aware, 
  or was wilfully blind to such errors and that it owed ING an implied duty of 
  good faith and fair dealing under the Share Purchase Agreement, to give due 
  and prompt notice of the alleged errors. This duty included an obligation to, 
  amongst other things, disclose to ING all errors that came to its attention 
  during the Due Diligence period and Interim Period that might adversely affect 
  or prejudice ING's position. ING pleads that Transamerica did not reveal the 
  information within its knowledge or the knowledge of its Advisors with respect 
  to the alleged errors. The failure of Transamerica to provide prompt notice 
  of the alleged errors was contrary to the reasonable intentions and expectations 
  of the parties and contrary to commercially reasonable standards of conduct 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>In oral argument counsel for ING acknowledged that he sought 
  to maintain the pleading of an implied duty of good faith during the Interim 
  Period only, not during the Due Diligence Period. </p>
<p>
  [89] Still, the parties did not stipulate that Transamerica had an obligation 
  to &quot;disclose to ING all facts that came to its attention...during the...Interim 
  Period that might adversely affect or prejudice ING's position.&quot; ING seeks 
  to add this obligation to the list of obligations Transamerica expressly undertook 
  by pleading an implied duty of good faith. This it cannot do.</p>
<p>
  [90] I have reached this conclusion for three reasons: </p>
<p>
  1. The relationship between the parties does not call for implying a duty of 
  good faith.</p>
<p>
  [91] This is not a contract between unequals where one party is vulnerable to 
  the bargaining strength of the other. Both ING and Transamerica are large, powerful 
  insurers. Both were represented on the transaction by major Toronto law firms. 
  And together they negotiated a sophisticated share purchase agreement, which 
  sets out each party's rights and obligations in excruciating detail. Yet nowhere 
  in their single spaced 69-page agreement is Transamerica under an obligation 
  to disclose to ING errors it may discover during the Interim Period, though 
  as a practical matter one may ask why it would opt not to do so and instead 
  &quot;lie in the bushes&quot; until after closing.</p>
<p>
  2. The terms of the share purchase agreement preclude implying a duty of good 
  faith.</p>
<p>
  a) Express disclosure obligation only on ING</p>
<p>
  [92] This is not a contract where the parties overlooked the question of disclosure. 
  Instead, they specifically addressed what disclosure obligations would be imposed 
  during the Interim Period. Article 4 of the agreement details each party's covenants 
  before closing. Article 4.5 is headed &quot;Disclosure&quot; and provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller shall immediately disclose in writing 
  to the Buyer any matter inconsistent in any respect with any of the Seller's 
  representations or warranties contained herein. </p>
<p>
  ING, not Transamerica, had a disclosure obligation during the Interim Period. 
  The parties could have struck a different bargain, a bargain that would impose 
  a disclosure obligation on Transamerica. Presumably they chose not to do so. 
  It is not for the courts, under the rubric of good faith, to rewrite their bargain 
  for them. Further, the absence of any disclosure obligation on Transamerica 
  may be contrasted with its duty - in Article 2.5 of the agreement - to speak 
  out (give notice) if it wished to dispute any of the various net worth calculations 
  before closing. </p>
<p>
  b) Express good faith obligations</p>
<p>
  [93] Moreover, this is not even a contract where the parties were silent about 
  good faith obligations. In three places in the contract the parties expressly 
  agreed that specific contractual obligations were to be carried out in good 
  faith.</p>
<p>
  [94] In Article 2.5 the parties agreed &quot;in good faith&quot; to negotiate 
  a resolution of any dispute over the calculation of net worth. In Article 4.13 
  the parties agreed - significantly, before closing - to &quot;work together 
  in good faith to find a commercially reasonable solution&quot; to any problem 
  caused by ING's failure to obtain certain third party consents and waivers. 
  In Article 8.4 the parties undertook to &quot;use all reasonable efforts, acting 
  in good faith&quot; to agree on the text of any required pre?closing public 
  announcement. Because of these specific contractual good faith provisions, I 
  am dubious whether there is any room to plead an implied duty of good faith, 
  even the one pleaded in paragraph 29 of the defence, let alone the implied duty 
  asserted in paragraphs 10(b) and 17. </p>
<p>
  c) Entire agreement, amendment and waiver clauses</p>
<p>
  [95] As is typical with major agreements of purchase and sale, the parties included 
  an entire agreement clause, an amendment clause and a waiver of rights clause 
  in their share purchase agreement. These clauses unambiguously signal that neither 
  party is to be burdened with an obligation not expressly set out in the contract 
  unless that additional obligation is agreed to in writing. The relevant provisions 
  state as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1.5 Entire Agreement</p>
<p class="indent">This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the 
  Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces 
  all prior agreements, negotiations, discussions and understandings, written 
  or oral, between the Parties including, from and after Closing, the Confidentiality 
  Agreement. There are no representations, warranties, conditions or other agreements 
  or acknowledgements, whether direct or collateral, express or implied, that 
  form part of or affect this Agreement, or which induced any Party to enter into 
  this Agreement or on which reliance is placed by any Party, except as specifically 
  set forth in this Agreement or in any other Closing Documents. </p>
<p class="indent">1.6 Amendment</p>
<p class="indent">This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only 
  by a written agreement signed by each Party. </p>
<p class="indent">1.7 Waiver of Rights</p>
<p class="indent">Any waiver of, or consent to depart from, the requirements of 
  any provision of this Agreement shall be effective only if it is in writing 
  and signed by the Party giving it, and only in the specific instance and for 
  the specific purpose for which it has been given. No failure on the part of 
  any Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right under this Agreement 
  shall operate as a waiver of such right. No single or partial exercise of any 
  such right shall preclude any other or further exercise of such right or the 
  exercise of any other right. </p>
<p>
  Implied obligations, such as the one contended for by ING in paragraphs 10(b) 
  and 17, are expressly excluded by the deal the parties made. </p>
<p>
  [96] To be sure, courts have not always given effect to entire agreement clauses. 
  See for example P.M. Perell, &quot;A Riddle Inside an Enigma: The Entire Agreement 
  Clause&quot; (May 1998) 20 Advocates' Q. 287; Shelanu Inc. v. Print Three Franchising 
  Corp. (2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 533 (C.A.). But they have not done so where, for 
  example, after signing a written contract, parties have entered into an oral 
  agreement and by their conduct have shown that they did not intend to be bound 
  by their previous written contract. ING has not pleaded an oral agreement or 
  any other facts that would make the entire agreement and related clauses inapplicable. 
  </p>
<p>
  d) Cooperation during the interim period</p>
<p>
  [97] ING contends that if Transamerica knew of errors or deficiencies before 
  closing, it had an obligation to disclose them before claiming damages to permit 
  ING to &quot;remedy such errors in a timely and cost?effective manner.&quot; 
  My colleague makes the related point that the pleading of an implied duty of 
  good faith in paragraphs 10(b) and 17 of the defence may be needed to give effect 
  to the price adjustment mechanism in Article 2.4 of the share purchase agreement.</p>
<p>
  [98] It seems to me, however, that the agreement the parties wrote crystallizes 
  Transamerica's obligations in the Interim Period. Its obligation was to cooperate 
  to maintain the value of the Company and to permit the closing to take place. 
  Therefore, under Article 4.4 Transamerica (together with ING) was required to 
  &quot;use all commercially reasonable and diligent efforts&quot; to maintain 
  the value and goodwill of the company and to facilitate the closing. Under Article 
  4.6 it was obliged to use &quot;reasonable commercial efforts&quot; to satisfy 
  the conditions of closing. In short, the parties addressed Transamerica's obligations 
  in the Interim Period and stopped short of imposing a duty to disclose errors. 
  Significantly, ING does not plead that Transamerica breached its obligation 
  to cooperate in Articles 4.4 and 4.6.</p>
<p>
  3. The conditions for implying a term have not been met.</p>
<p>
  [99] In Canada we have well?established rules for when courts can imply a term 
  in a contract. Terms may be implied in a contract in three situations: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1.) based on custom or usage; </p>
<p class="indent">2.) as the legal incidents of a particular class or kind of 
  contract; or </p>
<p class="indent">3.) based on the presumed intention of the parties where the 
  implied term must be necessary &quot;to give business efficacy to a contract 
  or as otherwise meeting the 'officious bystander' test as a term which the parties 
  would say, if questioned, that they had obviously assumed&quot;. </p>
<p>
  See M.J.B. Enterprises Ltd. v. Defence Construction (1951) Ltd., [1999] 1 S.C.R. 
  619 at para. 27. </p>
<p>
  [100] Only the last situation - the presumed intention of the parties - could 
  support ING's pleading of an implied duty of good faith, which, as I have said, 
  in reality is a pleading that Transamerica owed an implied duty of disclosure 
  during the Interim Period. But ING has not asserted that such an implied term 
  is necessary to give business efficacy to the contract or that this term is 
  one the parties would say they had obviously assumed.</p>
<p>
  [101] Nor could ING realistically maintain such an assertion. M.J.B. Enterprises 
  Ltd. is instructive. There the court considered whether terms could be implied 
  in a tender document. Writing for the court, Iacobucci J. commented that a &quot;degree 
  of obviousness&quot; is needed to imply a term and that it is important to look 
  at the express terms of the contract: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A court, when dealing with terms implied in fact, must be careful not to slide 
  into determining the intentions of reasonable parties. This is why the implication 
  of the term must have a certain degree of obviousness to it, and why, if there 
  is evidence of a contrary intention, on the part of either party, an implied 
  term may not be found on this basis. As G.H.L. Fridman states in The Law of 
  Contract in Canada (3rd ed. 1994), at p. 476: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In determining the intention of the parties, attention must be paid to the express 
  terms of the contract in order to see whether the suggested implication is necessary 
  and fits in with what has clearly been agreed upon, and the precise nature of 
  what, if anything, should be implied. </p>
<p>
  [102] Applying this passage here, I see nothing obvious or necessary about the 
  implied term pleaded by ING. Rather than fitting in with the written agreement 
  of the parties, it is quite inconsistent with that agreement. It is inconsistent 
  with the &quot;entire agreement&quot; and &quot;amendment&quot; clauses, with 
  the express disclosure obligation during the Interim Period imposed solely on 
  ING, and with the explicit references to good faith elsewhere in the agreement. 
  On the existing jurisprudence, I am not persuaded a court can imply a term that 
  Transamerica had a disclosure obligation during the Interim Period. By couching 
  its pleading in the language of good faith ING is attempting to do indirectly 
  what the case law precludes it from doing directly. </p>
<p>
  [103] I recognize that Rule 21 motions are not meant to defeat novel causes 
  of action or defences. Perhaps, in the appropriate case, a court may consider 
  using good faith as a tool to imply terms more readily than under the existing 
  rules laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada. For all the reasons I have already 
  discussed I do not consider this to be the appropriate case to do so. See E.A. 
  Farnsworth, &quot;Good Faith in Contract Performance&quot; in J. Beatson and 
  in D. Friedman, eds., Good Faith and Fault in Contract Law (Oxford: Clarendon 
  Press, 1995).</p>
<p>
  [104] I would allow the appeal to the limited extent set out in these reasons. 
  However, I would dismiss the appeal on paragraphs 10, 11, 17 (other than the 
  plea of &quot;wilful blindness&quot;) and 18 of the amended statement of defence. 
  Because success was divided, I would order no costs of the appeal. </p>
