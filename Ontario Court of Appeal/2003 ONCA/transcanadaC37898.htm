<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Dennis G. Lane of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated February 7, 2002. Reported at [2002] O.J. No. 428.</p>
<p>SIMMONS J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Commonwealth Insurance Company of Canada Limited (&quot;Commonwealth&quot;) 
  appeals from an order dismissing a summary judgment motion.</p>
<p>
  [2] Commonwealth moved for summary judgment to dismiss a third party action 
  brought against it by Potter Station Power Limited Partnership (&quot;Potter 
  Power&quot;). </p>
<p>
  [3] Potter Power commenced the third party action after it was sued by TransCanada 
  Pipelines Limited (&quot;TCPL&quot;). In the third party action, Potter Power 
  claimed indemnification under an insurance policy issued by Commonwealth and 
  a declaration requiring Commonwealth to defend TCPL's claim. However, Commonwealth 
  contended that its policy did not cover Potter Power's claims and moved to dismiss 
  the third party action.</p>
<p>
  [4] The motion judge found that the insurance coverage issues forming the subject 
  matter of the summary judgment motion were not yet &quot;ripe&quot; for determination. 
  Accordingly, he dismissed the summary judgment motion and ordered that Commonwealth 
  provide Potter Power with a defence to TCPL's claim.</p>
<p>
  [5] The main issues on this appeal are: (1) did the motion judge err in concluding 
  that the coverage issues forming the subject matter of the summary judgment 
  motion were not yet ready for determination; and (2) did the motion judge err 
  in ordering that Commonwealth provide Potter Power with a defence to the main 
  action?</p>
<p>
  [6] I have concluded that the motion judge did not err. Accordingly, I would 
  dismiss this appeal. </p>
<p>
  I. Background </p>
<p>
  [7] TCPL operates a natural gas pipeline between Alberta and Ontario as well 
  as a series of natural gas compressor stations that produce exhaust gas (&quot;waste 
  heat&quot;) during the gas transmission process.</p>
<p>
  [8] On May 21, 1993, Potter Power's predecessor (both entities will be referred 
  to as &quot;Potter Power&quot;) entered into an agreement (the &quot;Agreement&quot;) 
  with TCPL granting Potter Power the exclusive right to purchase the waste heat 
  produced by TCPL compressor station 102 (&quot;Station 102&quot;). </p>
<p>
  [9] The Agreement permitted Potter Power to build an electrical power generating 
  plant on the lands adjacent to Station 102 and to install a duct system connecting 
  Station 102 to its plant (the plant and duct system are referred to collectively 
  as the &quot;Facility&quot;). </p>
<p>
  [10] Potter Power began operating the Facility in November 1994. It used the 
  waste heat that it purchased from TCPL to convert water into steam, and it used 
  the steam to power a turbine to generate electricity.</p>
<p>
  [11] On August 16, 1995, the lands upon which Station 102 sit subsided, damaging 
  Station 102 and the Facility. </p>
<p>
  [12] On May 26, 1998, TCPL sued Potter Power for damages caused by the subsidence. 
  However, rather than asserting a cause of action in tort, TCPL relied on a clause 
  in the Agreement that requires Potter Power to indemnify it for damages arising 
  out of &quot;the operation and maintenance of the Facility&quot;. In particular, 
  TCPL claimed that Potter Power caused the subsidence by removing groundwater 
  from an underlying aquifer &quot;for use in the operation or maintenance of 
  the Facility&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [13] After it was sued by TCPL, Potter Power submitted an insurance claim to 
  Commonwealth. Potter Power was named as an Additional Insured under a &quot;Construction 
  Wrap-Up Liability&quot; policy that Commonwealth issued to the contractor who 
  built the Facility. The policy contained a &quot;Completed Operations Hazard&quot; 
  clause, which provided extended coverage for a period of thirty-six months following 
  completion of construction. </p>
<p>
  [14] Commonwealth denied coverage, claiming that the Completed Operations Hazard 
  clause is restricted to completed construction operations, in the sense of problems 
  arising from construction defects, and that it does not cover claims arising 
  from the ordinary operation of the Facility. </p>
<p> [15] Accordingly, Potter Power filed a defence and third partied both of its 
  insurers, Commonwealth and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Company of Canada 
  (&quot;Royal&quot;)<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>. In particular, Potter Power claimed 
  a declaration that the insurers were required to defend TCPL's claim, indemnification 
  for the damages that it suffered and, if necessary, an indemnity against TCPL's 
  claim. </p>
<p> [16] In addition to the summary judgment motion forming the subject-matter 
  of this appeal, Commonwealth brought a summary judgment motion to dismiss TCPL's 
  action, claiming that the indemnity TCPL relies on relates only to third party 
  claims and that it does not cover direct damages suffered by TCPL.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
</p>
<p> [17] Commonwealth advanced six arguments on the summary judgment motion to 
  dismiss the third party claim. First, if its summary judgment motion to dismiss 
  TCPL's action was successful, there was no basis for Potter Power's claim for 
  an indemnity relating to TCPL's claim. Second, the Completed Operations Hazard 
  clause in the Construction Wrap-Up Liability policy is restricted to claims 
  arising from completed construction operations. Third, the well from which the 
  water was drawn did not form part of the construction project on which the policy 
  was issued. Fourth, even if the well formed part of the construction project, 
  the policy contained a design exclusion clause that would preclude any claim 
  for negligence on the part of the Commonwealth or its forces in calculating 
  water usage. Fifth, Commonwealth's policy is a liability policy covering third 
  party claims; it does not cover Potter Power's claim for its own damages. Sixth, 
  because its policy does not cover Potter Power's claim, it has no duty to defend.</p>
<p>
  II. The Motion Judge's Reasons</p>
<p>
  [18] The main thrust of the motion judge's reasons for dismissing Commonwealth's 
  motion relating to the third party claim was that the insurance coverage issues 
  were not yet ready for determination. There were three prongs to this finding. 
  </p>
<p>
  [19] First, extrinsic evidence could be required to interpret the Completed 
  Operations Hazard clause in the policy. The motion judge found that the clause 
  was ambiguous because it was not clear that &quot;completed operations&quot; 
  referred to completed construction operations, as claimed by Commonwealth.</p>
<p>
  [20] Second, extrinsic evidence could be required to determine whether the well 
  formed part of the construction project that was covered under Commonwealth's 
  policy. The policy covers &quot;all sums which Potter shall become legally obligated 
  to pay as damages, but only with respect to the Project&quot;. However, the 
  &quot;Project&quot; is described only generally in the policy and Commonwealth 
  disputes Potter Power's claim that the well is part of the &quot;Project&quot;, 
  creating the potential for using extrinsic evidence to interpret the policy. 
  </p>
<p>
  [21] Third, Commonwealth obtained a consent order from the motion judge to amend 
  its statement of defence to plead the design exclusion. However, that exclusion 
  would only be relevant in the event of a claim for negligence in calculating 
  water usage. As of the date of the summary judgment motion, no such claim had 
  been made.</p>
<p>
  [22] By way of summary, the motion judge said that he was not satisfied that 
  he had all of the relevant evidence before him. Accordingly, he concluded that 
  none of the coverage issues were &quot;ripe for determination&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [23] In addition, because he had dismissed Commonwealth's motion to dismiss 
  the TCPL action in concurrent reasons, the motion judge found that Commonwealth 
  was required to provide Potter Power with a defence to TCPL's action.</p>
<p>
  III. The Relevant Provisions of Commonwealth's Insurance Policy</p>
<p>
  [24] In order to determine the issues on this appeal, it is necessary to review 
  some of the specific terms of the policy. I have highlighted the terms that 
  are particularly significant: </p>

<p>
  IV. Grounds of Appeal </p>
<p>
  [25] Commonwealth raised several grounds of appeal. In my view, the relevant 
  issues can properly be disposed of under two headings: </p>
<p>
  i. did the motion judge err in finding that the insurance coverage issues were 
  not yet ready for determination; and</p>
<p>
  ii. did the motion judge err in declaring that Commonwealth is obliged to provide 
  Potter Power with a defence to TCPL's action?</p>
<p>
  V. Analysis</p>
<p>
  i) Did the motion judge err in finding that the insurance coverage issues were 
  not yet ready for determination? </p>
<p>
  [26] It is important to note that there are two distinct coverage issues: (1) 
  the coverage issue arising from TCPL's claim against Potter Power and; (2) the 
  coverage issue arising from Potter Power's claim for its own damages. Although 
  the motion judge dealt with these issues separately, he relied on his reasons 
  for concluding that the TCPL coverage issue was not yet ready for determination 
  in reaching the same conclusion concerning Potter Power's claim for its own 
  damages. I will accordingly deal with both issues under the same heading.</p>
<p>
  [27] As already noted, there were three prongs to the motion judge's finding 
  that the coverage issues were not yet ready for determination. The first prong 
  was the motion judge's conclusion that the Completed Operations Hazard clause 
  is ambiguous. In my view, the motion judge's conclusion on this issue alone 
  justifies his finding that the coverage issue arising from TCPL's claim was 
  not yet ready for determination.</p>
<p>
  [28] Commonwealth claims that, in the context of construction insurance, its 
  Completed Operations Hazard clause is clearly restricted to completed construction 
  operations and that the motion judge erred by creating an ambiguity in the interpretation 
  of this clause when, in fact, none exists. Relying on an insurance text, the 
  language of a completed operations clause contained in a standard form construction 
  liability policy, and various authorities Commonwealth asserts that the coverage 
  provided by this clause is restricted to construction problems that first manifest 
  themselves in damages following the completion of construction, that it requires 
  a causal link between construction and the consequent damages and that it clearly 
  does not extend to damages arising from the ordinary course of day-to-day operations, 
  which is the basis of TCPL's claim. </p>
<p>
  [29] Moreover, referring to the specific language of the policy, Commonwealth 
  relies on the heading &quot;Construction Wrap-Up Liability Policy&quot;, the 
  overall tenor of the policy (which relates to construction) and the numerous 
  references in the Completed Operations Hazard clause to the operations being 
  &quot;completed&quot; or &quot;performed&quot;, in support of its claim that 
  the plain meaning of &quot;completed operations&quot; is completed construction 
  operations. </p>
<p>
  [30] In the alternative, Commonwealth claims that the motion judge erred by 
  leaving open the possibility of Potter Power adducing additional evidence to 
  assist in construing the policy. Commonwealth relies on the well-established 
  principle that a responding party on a summary judgment motion must put its 
  best foot forward and cannot rely on the possibility of further evidence. </p>
<p>
  [31] I do not accept Commonwealth's submissions for two reasons.</p>
<p>
  [32] First, I agree with the motion judge's conclusion that, while Commonwealth 
  may well be proved correct in its interpretation of the Completed Operations 
  Hazard clause, the language of the clause is ambiguous, creating the possibility 
  that extrinsic evidence will be required. </p>
<p>
  [33] In order to interpret the Completed Operations Hazard clause, it is necessary 
  to focus on the language of the policy. In that respect, Commonwealth is quite 
  correct in noting that there are several factors that favour its interpretation, 
  including the heading of the policy and certain specific references in the definition 
  of the Completed Operations Hazard coverage. I will repeat the main body of 
  the Completed Operations Hazard clause for ease of reference: </p>
<p class="indent"> 5. COMPLETED OPERATIONS HAZARD</p>
<p class="indent">&quot;COMPLETED OPERATIONS HAZARD&quot; includes &#133;Property 
  Damage arising out of operations on the Project, but only if the &#133; Property 
  Damage occurs after such operations have been completed. Operations include 
  materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection therewith. Operations 
  shall be deemed completed at the earliest of the following times &#133;</p>
<p>
  [34] The references here and later in the clause to operations being completed 
  imply that the operations must have been part of the construction; otherwise 
  they could not be &quot;completed&quot;. Further, the reference to damage &quot;arising 
  out of operations on the Project&quot; imports a concept of causal connection.</p>
<p>
  [35] Nevertheless, in my view, the phrase, &quot;'Completed Operations Hazard' 
  includes &#133; Property Damage arising out of operations on the Project, but 
  only if [it] occurs after such operations have been completed&quot; is ambiguous, 
  because it conveys the meaning that there is general liability coverage for 
  operations and that the coverage arises at a specified time. The motion judge 
  expressed that time as being &quot;the date on which the portion of the work 
  out of which the loss arises has been completed and put into service&quot;. 
  I agree with his description.</p>
<p>
  [36] Moreover, in my view, the motion judge's conclusion is supported by an 
  examination of the language of the &quot;Maintenance Operations Hazard&quot; 
  clause. Again, I will repeat the relevant portion of that clause for ease of 
  reference: </p>
<p class="indent">
  6. MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS HAZARD</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> &quot;MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS&quot; include all operations which 
  are required because of further service or maintenance work or correction, repair 
  or replacement arising from the original construction operations on the Project, 
  but in no event shall include routine maintenance activities usual to the operation 
  of the completed project [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [37] The highlighted portion of the Maintenance Operations Hazard clause makes 
  it clear that that coverage relates to matters &quot;arising from the original 
  construction operations on the project&quot;. Commonwealth claims that this 
  language confirms that the focus of the policy is construction, and therefore, 
  that coverage is limited to claims arising from construction operations. However, 
  in my view, the absence of similar clear language clarifying what was meant 
  by &quot;operations&quot; in the second line of the Completed Operations Hazard 
  clause supports the interpretation advanced by Potter Power.</p>
<p>
  [38] In summary, I agree with the motion judge's finding that the Completed 
  Operations Hazard clause is ambiguous and that, as a result, extrinsic evidence 
  could be required to determine its meaning.</p>
<p>
  [39] Second, I am not persuaded that Commonwealth can rely on Potter Power's 
  failure to adduce extrinsic evidence relating to its proposed interpretation 
  of the policy in this case. </p>
<p>
  [40] In summarizing his conclusions on the coverage issues, the motion judge 
  stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; I have no assurance that all relevant evidence is before me, indeed it 
  is obvious that it is not. The meaning of the provisions in question is far 
  from clear&#133;.</p>
<p>
  [41] Aside from the policy itself, the only evidence Commonwealth led that was 
  relevant to the interpretation of the policy consisted of certain exhibits appended 
  to the affidavit of a law clerk. In my view, it is apparent that the motion 
  judge was not satisfied that Commonwealth had met its evidentiary burden of 
  bringing forward the evidence necessary to interpret the Completed Operations 
  Hazard clause in the face of an ambiguity. I see no basis for interfering with 
  his conclusion. </p>
<p>
  [42] On this ground alone, I conclude that the motion judge was correct in holding 
  that the coverage issue relating to TCPL's claim was not yet ready for determination.</p>
<p>
  [43] The second prong of the motion judge's reasons for holding that the coverage 
  issue relating to TCPL's claim was not yet ready for determination was his conclusion 
  that the status of the well as part of the Project was a disputed question of 
  fact, requiring additional evidence.</p>
<p>
  [44] Commonwealth claims that the trial judge erred in making this finding, 
  because, although Commonwealth actually raised the &quot;semantic question&quot; 
  of whether the well forms part of the Project, there were no disputed underlying 
  facts relating to this issue. In particular, Commonwealth points out that the 
  parties were agreed that the well was constructed in 1965, but that it was connected 
  to the Facility by pumps and pipes during the construction phase of the Project.</p>
<p>
  [45] Once again, I do not accept Commonwealth's submission. The motion judge 
  was fully aware of when the well was built and how it was connected to the Facility. 
  He said at para. 13: </p>
<p class="indent">
  TransCanada's claim does not differentiate between the well and the rest of 
  Potter's facility. There can be no doubt that, as operated, the well is part 
  of that facility. Whether it was part of the construction project which was 
  the subject of Commonwealth's policy is a disputed question of fact. The well 
  was built originally in 1965 by TransCanada, then the owner of the land, and 
  was connected to the new Potter construction by placing pumps and piping in 
  it and connecting them to the remainder of the facility. The parties do not 
  agree whether it was thereby part of the project.</p>
<p>
  [46] The motion judge's finding that there was a disputed issue of fact did 
  not relate to the physical construction of the well; it related to the parties' 
  intentions concerning whether the well, and its subsequent operation, come within 
  the scope of the Project covered by the policy. I see no error in the motion 
  judge's finding nor in his conclusion that extrinsic evidence could be required 
  to determine this issue.</p>
<p>
  [47] The third prong of the motion judge's reasons for holding that the coverage 
  issue relating to TCPL's claim was not yet ready for determination was his observation 
  that he had just been asked to permit an amendment to Commonwealth's statement 
  of defence to plead the design exclusion, which would be relevant to a potential 
  claim that the subsidence was caused by negligence in calculating water usage.</p>
<p>
  [48] Commonwealth claims that this finding was irrelevant to the determination 
  of the issues on the motion because, at that point, TCPL had not advanced any 
  claim based on negligence.</p>
<p>
  [49] On my reading of his reasons, the motion judge was well aware of the claims 
  that had been advanced. He simply noted that, in addition to raising factual 
  issues, the party moving for summary judgment had requested leave to amend its 
  pleading to respond to an issue that had not been raised by the other parties. 
  This supported his conclusion that this case had not yet reached a stage where 
  any final decisions should be made. </p>
<p>
  [50] In my view, the motion judge's finding that the coverage issue relating 
  to TCPL's claim was not yet ready for determination was correct.</p>
<p>
  [51] As for the coverage issue relating to Potter Power's claim for its own 
  damages, the motion judge stated at para. 10: </p>
<p class="indent">
  For reasons expressed in the next section, it is not appropriate to deal with 
  the coverage issues at this stage of this action and in the summary judgment 
  context.</p>
<p>
  [52] In effect, the motion judge relied on his findings that the Completed Operations 
  Hazard clause was ambiguous and that extrinsic evidence would be necessary to 
  resolve the question of the parties' intentions concerning the scope of the 
  coverage. In these circumstances, I see no basis for interfering with his conclusion 
  that it was premature to deal with any coverage issues at that stage of the 
  proceedings.</p>
<p>
  ii) Did the motion judge err in declaring that Commonwealth is obliged to provide 
  Potter Power with a defence to TCPL's action?</p>
<p>
  [53] I have concluded that the motion judge did not err in declaring that Commonwealth 
  has an obligation to provide Potter Power with a defence to TCPL's action for 
  three reasons.</p>
<p>
  [54] First, Commonwealth's submissions on this issue depended on two main points 
  and I have not accepted either of them. Commonwealth's first point was that 
  TCPL has no viable cause of action against Potter Power because the indemnity 
  TCPL relied on in its action against Potter Power does not cover damages that 
  it suffered directly. I rejected this position in reasons released concurrently 
  with these reasons.</p>
<p>
  [55] Commonwealth's second point was that, even if TCPL has a cause of action 
  against Potter Power, its Construction Wrap-Up Liability policy does not cover 
  damages caused by the ordinary operation of the Facility. On this issue, I concluded 
  that the motion judge was correct in holding that the Completed Operations Hazard 
  clause is ambiguous and that the coverage issue requires a trial. </p>
<p>
  [56] Second, Commonwealth did not take any real issue with Potter Power's assertion 
  that the insurer has an obligation to defend where the coverage is unclear.</p>
<p>
  [57] Third, the caselaw dealing with the duty to defend appears to support imposing 
  a duty to defend except in cases where coverage is clearly excluded. For example, 
  in Jon Picken Ltd. v. Guardian Insurance Co. of Canada (1993), 66 O.A.C. 39 
  at 42 this court said the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The duty to defend arises where the action against the named insured (or any 
  unnamed insureds) alleges acts, or omissions for which damages are claimed which 
  might be payable under the policy. The widest latitude should be given to the 
  allegations in the claim to determine whether the claim made raises claims within 
  the policy. Any uncertainty as to whether the claim makes allegations which, 
  if established, could give rise to an award of damages within the coverage provided 
  by the policy ought to be resolved in favour of the respondents. See Nichols, 
  supra, at p. 329 [Nichols v. American Home Assurance Co. (1990), 68 D.L.R. (4th) 
  321, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 801.]</p>
<p> [58] I am mindful of the fact that in Nichols, McLachlin J. (as she then was) 
  identified two policy reasons for holding that the duty to defend is not independent 
  of the duty to indemnify. First, a free-standing duty to defend would mean that 
  insurers would have to pay defence costs for claims not covered by the policy, 
  raising questions concerning &quot;whether others in the insurance pool should 
  be taxed with providing defences for matters outside the purview of the policy&quot;<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a>. 
  Second, an independent duty to defend could raise conflict of interest issues 
  because &quot;[i]f the insurer is defending claims for which it owes no duty 
  to indemnify, there is a strong incentive simply to settle the claim as quickly 
  as possible&quot;<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a>. </p>
<p>
  [59] Given that there has been no determination that TCPL's claim as pleaded 
  falls outside the scope of coverage, imposing a duty to defend here does not 
  contravene either policy concern.</p>
<p>
  [60] In this case, it was Commonwealth who requested that the duty to indemnify 
  and defend be clarified prior to trial. Had there been clear evidence that the 
  reasonable expectations of the parties were that there be no coverage for damages 
  caused by the ordinary operation of the Facility, it was open to Commonwealth 
  to bring that evidence forward. It did not do so, leading to a finding that 
  coverage cannot be excluded at this stage of the action. </p>
<p>
  [61] In these circumstances, I see no basis for concluding that the motion judge 
  erred in declaring that Commonwealth has an obligation to provide Potter Power 
  with a defence to TCPL's claim.</p>
<p>VI. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [62] Based on the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss this appeal with costs. 
  I would permit the respondents file brief written submissions on costs within 
  seven days following the release of these reasons. I would permit the appellant 
  to respond within seven days thereafter. </p>
