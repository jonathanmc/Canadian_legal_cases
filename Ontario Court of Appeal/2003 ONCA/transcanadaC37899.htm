<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Dennis G. Lane of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated February 7, 2002. Reported at [2002] O.J. No. 429.</p>
<p>
  SIMMONS J.A.: </p>
<p class="indent"></p>
<p>
  [1] In 1995, a natural gas compressor station owned by TransCanada Pipelines 
  Limited (&quot;TCPL&quot;) was damaged when the land on which it sits subsided. 
  Relying on an indemnity provision in a contract, TCPL sued Potter Station Power 
  Limited Partnership (&quot;Potter Power&quot;) for the damages that it suffered 
  as a result of this incident.</p>
<p> [2] Commonwealth Insurance Company<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> (&quot;Commonwealth&quot;) 
  is one of Potter Power's insurers. Commonwealth brought a summary judgment motion 
  to dismiss TCPL's action, claiming that the indemnity provision is restricted 
  to claims against TCPL by third parties and that it does not cover first party 
  losses suffered by TCPL directly.</p>
<p>
  [3] The main issue on this appeal is whether the motion judge erred in declaring 
  that the indemnity provision extends to damages suffered by TCPL directly. </p>
<p>
  [4] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal. I would dispose 
  of the cross-appeal in the manner agreed upon by the parties.</p>
<p>
  I. Background</p>
<p>
  [5] For many years, TCPL has operated a natural gas pipeline between Alberta 
  and Ontario. Its facilities include a series of compressor stations that produce 
  exhaust gas (&quot;waste heat&quot;) as part of the natural gas transmission 
  process. </p>
<p>
  [6] On May 3, 1990, Potter Power's predecessor (both entities will be referred 
  to collectively as &quot;Potter Power&quot;) entered into an agreement with 
  TCPL granting Potter Power the exclusive right to purchase the waste heat produced 
  by compressor station 102. It also permitted Potter Power to construct an electrical 
  power generating facility (the &quot;Facility&quot;) on the adjacent land and 
  to connect it to station 102 using a duct system.</p>
<p>
  [7] On May 21, 1993, the parties entered into a further agreement (the &quot;Waste 
  Heat Agreement&quot;), which included provisions requiring each of TCPL and 
  Potter Power to indemnify the other in certain circumstances. The indemnity 
  in favour of TCPL (the &quot;Indemnity&quot;) is in issue on this appeal. The 
  specific terms of the Indemnity are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  10. Potter Power shall indemnify and save harmless TransCanada from and against 
  all liability, actions, claims, losses, costs and damages which may be brought 
  against or suffered by TransCanada and which TransCanada may incur, sustain 
  or pay arising out of or in connection with: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) construction, operation and maintenance of the Facility 
  (including the Duct System);</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the negligence or willful misconduct of Potter Power, its 
  directors, officers, employees, agents, servants, contractors and subcontractors 
  arising out of or incidental to this Agreement; or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) a breach by Potter Power of any of the terms and conditions 
  set forth in this Agreement,</p>
<p class="indent">except to the extent that such losses or damages, result from 
  the negligence or willful misconduct of TransCanada [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[8] On August 16, 1995, the lands upon which station 102 sits subsided, damaging 
  the compressor station, its associated equipment, and the Facility. </p>
<p>
  [9] Relying on the Indemnity, TCPL issued a statement of claim against Potter 
  Power on May 26, 1998 in which it claimed that Potter Power caused the subsidence 
  by removing groundwater from an underlying aquifer in order to operate the Facility. 
  </p>
<p>
  [10] On October 23, 1998, Potter Power delivered a statement of defence, denying 
  that it caused the subsidence and counterclaiming against TCPL under its indemnity 
  in the Waste Heat Agreement. </p>
<p>
  [11] Potter Power added Commonwealth to the proceeding as a third party. Commonwealth, 
  in turn, defended the main action and brought a summary judgment motion to dismiss 
  it. In particular, it claimed that the Indemnity relates only to claims against 
  TCPL by third parties and that it does not extend to first party claims, that 
  is, to damages suffered by TCPL directly.</p>
<p>
  [12] In response to Commonwealth's motion TCPL delivered an affidavit from a 
  solicitor formerly employed in its legal department (the &quot;TCPL solicitor&quot;). 
  In his affidavit, the TCPL solicitor confirmed that he &quot;was involved&quot; 
  in drafting the Waste Heat Agreement and gave evidence about TCPL's motivation 
  for seeking the Indemnity, and its intentions and instructions concerning the 
  nature of the Indemnity. The TCPL solicitor also indicated that he had &quot;no 
  recollection&quot; of specific discussions or correspondence with Potter Power 
  concerning the wording of the Indemnity.</p>
<p> [13] On the return of the motion, Commonwealth objected to the admissibility 
  of several elements of the TCPL solicitor's evidence. Relying on authorities 
  such as Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Novopharm Ltd.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a>, it claimed 
  that the impugned elements amounted to inadmissible evidence of the subjective 
  intentions of a contracting party. </p>
<p>
  [14] In his reasons, the motion judge admitted some parts of the impugned evidence 
  and rejected others. In particular, he admitted the following extract from the 
  TCPL solicitor's affidavit, on the basis that it was a &quot;description of 
  the background commercial considerations underlying the transaction&quot;.</p>
<p class="indent"> Potter Limited wished to purchase from TransCanada lands which 
  were contiguous to Station 102 and wished to erect on such lands a waste heat 
  recovery facility for the purpose of electrical power generation&#133; TransCanada 
  would permit the Potter Power Facility next to the TransCanada Facility only 
  if it was satisfied that the construction, operation or maintenance of the Potter 
  Power Facility would not interfere with the operation of [the] TransCanada Facility. 
  That is why TransCanada wanted to approve the plans of the Potter Power Facility, 
  and wanted as a form of insurance, an indemnity from the operators of the Potter 
  Power Facility in the form set out in paragraph 10 of the Waste Heat Agreement... 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[15] The motion judge concluded that the Indemnity extends to damages suffered 
  by TCPL directly and dismissed the summary judgment motion.</p>
<p>
  II. The Motion Judge's Reasons </p>
<p>[16] In dismissing Commonwealth's summary judgment motion, the motion judge 
  found that the relevant caselaw &quot;does not establish a general principle 
  that wherever words of indemnity are found, the obligation created is confined&quot; 
  to third party claims. Rather, he said &quot;[t]he principle exemplified by 
  every case cited is that the obligation is governed by the words chosen, when 
  placed and read in their context&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [17] The motion judge determined that, when read in context, the specific words 
  used in the Indemnity demonstrate that a broader meaning was intended than simply 
  protection against third party claims. In particular, he found that the emphasized 
  portion of the phrase </p>
<p class="indent"> indemnify and save harmless TransCanada from and against all 
  liability, actions, claims, losses, costs and damages which might be brought 
  against or suffered by TransCanada</p>
<p>introduces &quot;an alternative to 'brought against', namely, 'suffered' which 
  is more appropriately associated with damage to TransCanada itself&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [18] The heart of the motion judge's reasoning is set out in paragraphs 36-38 
  of his reasons: </p>
<p class="indent"> [36] Certainly there are words of indemnity here and the words 
  &quot;which might be brought against&quot; TransCanada may be appropriately 
  associated with an indemnity against claims of third parties. However, the language 
  refers to &quot;losses, costs and damages&quot; and continues &quot;..or suffered 
  by TransCanada ..&quot; which appears to me to introduce an alternative to &quot;brought 
  against&quot;, namely &quot;suffered&quot; which is more appropriately associated 
  with damage to TransCanada itself. When the words are put together to read &quot;..losses, 
  costs and damages which may be suffered by TransCanada&quot;, they are surely 
  appropriately read more broadly than simply claims by third parties. If every 
  word is to be given meaning, and &quot;brought against&quot; covers the claims 
  of third parties, it follows that &quot;suffered&quot; relates to something 
  else, which must be direct damage to TransCanada.</p>
<p class="indent">[37] This approach is reinforced when we move to consider the 
  balance of paragraph 10: </p>
<p class="indent"> &quot;..and which TransCanada may incur, sustain or pay arising 
  out of or in connection with&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">[38] Here the parties are directing their minds to the circumstances 
  out of which these liabilities may flow. The words &quot;incur, sustain or pay&quot; 
  are not confined to third party claims; one incurs or sustains or pays regardless 
  of the kind of loss one is dealing with. Then the agreement lists, as (a), (b) 
  and (c), three sources of the obligation of Potter. Far from confining them 
  to claims by third parties, which could easily have been expressly done, they 
  use language which grammatically and logically includes direct claims by TransCanada 
  against Potter arising from breach of contract under (c); from negligence or 
  willful misconduct under (b); and, under (a), from the operation of Potter's 
  Facility [emphasis added].</p>
<p>III. Grounds of Appeal</p>
<p>
  [19] Commonwealth contends that the motion judge erred in two separate but related 
  respects in concluding that the Indemnity extends to TCPL's claim for damages 
  that it suffered directly: </p>
<p class="indent"> i) he failed to advert to or apply the principle of contra 
  proferentem; and </p>
<p class="indent">ii) he failed to find, at a minimum, that the Indemnity is ambiguous 
  concerning whether it covers TCPL's claim for its own damages.</p>
<p>IV. Analysis</p>
<p>i) Did the motion judge err in failing to advert to or apply the principle 
  of contra proferentem?</p>
<p>[20] Commonwealth submits that because TCPL was the exclusive drafter of the 
  Indemnity, the motion judge erred by failing to recognize that contra proferentem 
  is the governing principle of contractual interpretation in this case, and by 
  failing to resolve any ambiguity in the Indemnity against TCPL's interest. </p>
<p>
  [21] I disagree. In my view, it is apparent from the motion judge's reasons 
  that he did not find the Indemnity ambiguous. For reasons that I will explain 
  in the next section, I agree with that conclusion. Accordingly, it was unnecessary 
  that the motion judge deal with the principle of contra proferentem. </p>
<p> [22] In Consolidated-Bathurst Export Limited v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery 
  Insurance Company<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a>, Estey J., speaking for the majority of 
  the Supreme Court of Canada, made it clear that contra proferentem applies only 
  once a finding of ambiguity is made. At page 901, Estey J. quoted the following 
  excerpt from Cornish v. Accident Insurance Company<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a> with 
  approval: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Lindley L.J. put it this way: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In a case on the line, in a case of real doubt, the policy ought to be construed 
  most strongly against the insurers; they frame the policy and insert the exceptions. 
  But this principle ought only to be applied for the purpose of removing a doubt, 
  not for the purpose of creating a doubt, or magnifying an ambiguity, when the 
  circumstances of the case raise no real difficulty [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[23] As it was therefore unnecessary that the motion judge address the principle 
  of contra proferentem, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  ii) Did the motion judge err in failing to find, at a minimum, that the Indemnity 
  is ambiguous concerning whether it covers TCPL's claim for its own damages?</p>
<p>[24] Commonwealth submits that the motion judge made six errors in interpreting 
  the Indemnity. First, he admitted inadmissible evidence of TCPL's subjective 
  contractual intentions. Second, he failed to hold that a long history of caselaw 
  demonstrates that the starting point for interpreting the words &quot;indemnify 
  and save harmless&quot; is that they refer to third party claims. Third, he 
  failed to recognize that the language of the Indemnity is equally referable 
  to third party claims and claims for first party losses and that the Indemnity 
  is therefore ambiguous. Fourth, he gave insufficient weight to Mobil Oil Canada 
  Ltd. v. Beta Well Service Ltd.<a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="r5"></a> in which both the Alberta 
  Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada held that the language of a 
  similarly worded indemnity was restricted to third party claims. Fifth, he failed 
  to recognize that the terms of the Waste Heat Agreement and its surrounding 
  context weigh against interpreting the Indemnity as extending to damages suffered 
  by TCPL directly. Sixth, in interpreting the Indemnity, he relied improperly 
  on Potter Power's counterclaim.</p>
<p>
  [25] I find it unnecessary to determine whether the appellants' first two submissions 
  are correct. Even assuming that Commonwealth's first two submissions are correct, 
  I agree with the motion judge's conclusion that the Indemnity is not ambiguous 
  for four reasons.</p>
<p>
  [26] First, assuming, without deciding, that the motion judge should not have 
  admitted the impugned portions of the TCPL solicitor's affidavit, on a fair 
  reading of the Waste Heat Agreement and the admissible portions of the affidavit, 
  I agree with the motion judge's statement concerning the context in which the 
  Waste Heat Agreement must be read (at para. 18): </p>
<p class="indent">
  The problem before me is therefore one of interpretation of paragraph 10 against 
  the context of two sophisticated businesses becoming both commercially and geographically 
  involved with each other. TransCanada became a supplier to Potter and Potter 
  a customer of TransCanada. Potter also became a neighbour of TransCanada with 
  physical connections between them for the conveyance of the heat being purchased 
  and sold. Potter came to a situation where TransCanada had carried on its business 
  for many years.</p>
<p>[27] Second, assuming, without deciding, that the starting point for interpreting 
  the phrase &quot;indemnify and save harmless&quot; is that it refers to third 
  party claims, I agree with the motion judge's conclusion at paragraph 36 of 
  his reasons that, when read fairly and in context, the language of the Indemnity 
  is &quot;appropriately read more broadly than [covering] simply claims by third 
  parties&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [28] I will repeat the relevant provisions of the Indemnity for ease of reference: </p>
<p class="indent">
  10. Potter Power shall indemnify and save harmless TransCanada from and against 
  all liability, actions, claims, losses, costs and damages which may be brought 
  against or suffered by TransCanada and which TransCanada may incur, sustain 
  or pay arising out of or in connection with: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) construction, operation and maintenance of the Facility (including the Duct 
  System) [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[29] In particular, I adopt the motion judge's reasoning that the words &quot;losses, 
  costs and damages which may be &#133; suffered by TransCanada&quot; introduce 
  an obvious alternative to &quot;all liability, actions, claims &#133; which 
  may be brought against &#133; TransCanada&quot; and that, when read in context, 
  the alternative is &quot;more appropriately associated with damage to TransCanada 
  itself&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [30] On this issue, I specifically reject Commonwealth's submission that the 
  motion judge erred in failing to recognize that the emphasized words are equally 
  referable to third party claims and first party claims for direct damages. In 
  particular, Commonwealth contends that a third party claim will involve a &quot;loss 
  suffered&quot; or &quot;damages incurred or paid&quot; either when the claim 
  is settled before formal indemnification is sought or when a judgment in favour 
  of a third party is awarded or paid and that the Indemnity is therefore ambiguous. 
  </p>
<p>
  [31] In my view, this submission is no more than an attempt to create an ambiguity 
  by attaching an obscure meaning to unambiguous words. </p>
<p>
  [32] Third, I reject Commonwealth's submission that the motion judge gave insufficient 
  weight to Mobil Oil and conclude that it is distinguishable from this case for 
  the following reasons. </p>
<p>
  [33] Contrary to Commonwealth's submission, the language of the two indemnity 
  provisions is different in a significant way. The Mobil Oil clause provides 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [Beta] shall be liable for and shall indemnify and save harmless Mobil Oil of 
  and from all manner of actions, causes of action, proceedings, claims, demands, 
  loss, costs, damages and expenses whatsoever which may be brought or made against 
  Mobil Oil or which it may sustain, pay, or incur as a result of or in connection 
  with the performance, purported performance or non-performance of this agreement 
  or other work hereunder by [Beta]&#133;</p>
<p>[34] By contrast, the Indemnity provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  10. Potter Power shall indemnify and save harmless TransCanada from and against 
  all liability, actions, claims, losses, costs and damages which may be brought 
  against or suffered by TransCanada and which TransCanada may incur, sustain 
  or pay arising out of or in connection with: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) construction, operation and maintenance of the Facility (including the Duct 
  System) [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[35] The key difference between the two provisions is the compelling alternative 
  introduced by the words &quot;which may be brought against or suffered by&quot; 
  in the Indemnity.</p>
<p>
  [36] In the Mobil Oil provision, there is no similar clear alternative. Rather, 
  in Mobil Oil, the potential alternative is between the words &quot;which may 
  be brought or made against&quot; and the words &quot;which it may sustain, pay, 
  or incur&quot;. However, while the words &quot;which may be brought or made 
  against&quot; appear to be used synonymously, such that each verb applies individually 
  to only some of the preceding nouns, it is not obvious whether the words &quot;which 
  it may sustain, pay, or incur&quot; are to be interpreted synonymously and applied 
  individually to only some of the preceding nouns or whether they are to be interpreted 
  as introducing an alternative by applying each verb individually to all of the 
  preceding nouns. Put another way, in Mobil Oil, the words &quot;which it may 
  sustain, pay, or incur&quot;, when juxtaposed against &quot;which may be brought 
  or made against&quot; and interpreted in conjunction with the rest of the clause, 
  do not produce the same compelling alternative that exists in the Indemnity.</p>
<p>
  [37] In addition, the commercial context of the two cases is vastly different. 
  Mobil Oil involved an indemnity contained in a repair contract between an oil 
  and gas well servicing company and a well owner. A clause in the repair contract 
  required the servicing company to perform its work in a good and workmanlike 
  manner. It therefore established a standard of performance that was inconsistent 
  with absolute liability on the part of the contractor. Moreover, a schedule 
  stipulated that the contractor would be &quot;held responsible only for its 
  willful misconduct and failure to exercise good faith at all times&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [38] In contrast, and, in my view, contrary to Commonwealth's submissions, neither 
  the specific terms of the Waste Heat Agreement nor its surrounding context weigh 
  against interpreting the Indemnity as extending to damages suffered by TCPL 
  directly. In particular, paragraph 6(b) of the Waste Heat Agreement refers only 
  to complying with regulatory standards and obtaining TCPL's prior approval of 
  all designs and construction drawings. Because neither reference establishes 
  a particular standard of performance, they are not inconsistent with absolute 
  liability on the part of Potter Power. Further, the parallel indemnity in the 
  Waste Heat Agreement in favour of Potter Power is limited to claims arising 
  from the negligence or willful misconduct of TCPL, both of which are specifically 
  excluded from Potter Power's obligation under the Indemnity. In my view, there 
  is no provision in the Waste Heat Agreement that is inconsistent with absolute 
  liability on the part of Potter Power.</p>
<p>
  [39] Fourth, I reject Commonwealth's submission that the motion judge relied 
  improperly on Potter Power's counterclaim in interpreting the Indemnity. Although 
  the motion judge, when summarizing the positions of the parties, recited TCPL's 
  argument that Potter Power's conduct indicated that it shared TCPL's interpretation 
  of the Indemnity there is no indication in his analysis that he relied on this 
  argument in reaching his decision.</p>
<p>
  [40] In summary, I conclude that the motion judge did not err in his conclusion 
  concerning the meaning of the Indemnity and I would not give effect to this 
  ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  V. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [41] For the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal with costs. The respondent 
  may file submissions concerning the quantum of costs within seven days from 
  the date hereof and the appellant may respond thereto within seven days thereafter.</p>
<p>
  [42] On consent, I would allow the cross-appeal without costs, and amend paragraph 
  1 of the order dated February 7, 2002 to read: </p>
<p class="indent">
  THIS COURT DECLARES that paragraph 10 of an agreement at issue in this action 
  includes an indemnity against direct loss or damage to TransCanada Pipelines 
  Limited's property arising out of or in connection with the construction, operation 
  and maintenance of the Potter facility.</p>
