<p>On appeal from the decision of Justice Baig of the Ontario Court of Justice 
  on May 17, 2002 dismissing an appeal from Justice of the Peace B. Leaman on 
  January 9, 2001, and on appeal from the decision of Justice B. Knazan of the 
  Ontario Court of Justice on August 1, 2002 dismissing an appeal from the decision 
  of Justice of the Peace J. M. McNish on July 26, 2001.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT: </p>
<p> [1] The issue in these two appeals is whether it is open to the Legislature 
  to create an absolute liability offence where there is no possibility of imprisonment 
  or probation if the defendant is convicted. Section 84.1(1) of the Highway Traffic 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 provides that the owner and operator of a commercial 
  motor vehicle are guilty of an offence where a wheel becomes detached from the 
  vehicle while it is on a highway. Subsection (5) provides that it is no defence 
  to the charge that the defendant exercised due diligence to avoid or prevent 
  the detaching of the wheel. The penalty for the offence is a fine of not less 
  than $2,000 and not more than $50,000,<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  but the defendant is not liable to imprisonment or probation as a result of 
  the conviction or for default in payment of the fine resulting from the conviction 
  (subsection (4)).</p>
<p> [2] The defendants submit that notwithstanding the only possible penalty for 
  this offence is a monetary one, the creation of this absolute liability offence 
  violates the guarantee to security of the person in s. 7 of the Canadian Charter 
  of Rights and Freedoms and the presumption of innocence in s. 11(d) of the Charter. 
  For the following reasons we have concluded that there is no violation of s. 
  7 or s. 11(d). We therefore allow the Crown appeal in the Transport Robert case 
  and dismiss the appeal by William Cameron Trucking.</p>
<p> HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p> [3] In separate incidents, 1260448 Ontario Inc., operating as William Cameron 
  Trucking, and Transport Robert (1973) Lte&eacute;, were charged with being the 
  owner of commercial motor vehicles from which a wheel separated while on a public 
  highway, contrary to s. 84.1(1) of the HTA. At their separate trials, the defendants 
  argued that creation of an absolute liability offence violated s. 7 and 11(d) 
  of the Charter and that it should be open to them to defend the charge on the 
  basis that they exercised due diligence. The defendants adduced evidence to 
  explain the loss of the wheel from the commercial vehicle and to show that they 
  acted with due diligence.</p>
<p> [4] In the Transport Robert prosecution Justice of the Peace McNish found 
  that there was a violation of s. 11(d). He also accepted that the defendant 
  had exercised due diligence and dismissed the charge. An appeal by the Crown 
  to Knazan J. of the Provincial Offences Appeal Court was successful in part. 
  Knazan J. found that there was a violation of s. 7 of the Charter but allowed 
  the Crown appeal and ordered a new trial because Justice of the Peace McNish 
  erred in excluding certain expert evidence that the Crown sought to call on 
  the due diligence issue. </p>
<p> [5] In the William Cameron Trucking case, Justice of the Peace Leaman at trial 
  and Baig J. on appeal found that there was no violation of either s. 7 or 11(d) 
  of the Charter. William Cameron Trucking was accordingly convicted and fined 
  $2,500. </p>
<p> THE FACTS</p>
<p> [6] In view of our conclusion on the constitutional issue, it is unnecessary 
  to review the facts of either prosecution in any great deal. Most of the evidence 
  adduced at the trials was led in an attempt to explain how the wheels became 
  detached and why the defendants nevertheless acted with due diligence.</p>
<p> Transport Robert</p>
<p> [7] On May 29, 1999, a truck operated by Transport Robert was travelling westbound 
  on Highway 401 at Leslie Street in the City of Toronto, when a wheel separated 
  from the attached trailer. The wheel fasteners had backed off of the studs. 
</p>
<p> [8] The wheel that separated from the trailer was newly installed to replace 
  an older wheel. The theory of the Crown was that the newly installed wheel probably 
  came loose because, contrary to manufacturers' recommendations, the defendant 
  had not had the wheel retorqued within 80 to 160 km after the installation. 
  The defendants disputed this explanation and also led extensive evidence to 
  justify their standard practice for retorquing.</p>
<p> William Cameron Trucking</p>
<p> [9] On December 5, 1998, a truck owned by William Cameron Trucking was found 
  on the eastbound shoulder of Hwy 11/17. The right front wheel was missing from 
  the tractor unit. The missing wheel was found in a nearby ditch. </p>
<p> [10] William Cameron Trucking suggested that the wheel separation occurred 
  because of the breaking of a stud, which caused the clamp to fall off. At trial, 
  William Cameron Trucking's expert, Dr. A.G. Gillies, testified that while he 
  could not determine the exact cause of the stud failure, it could be attributed 
  to &quot;hydrogen embrittlement&quot;, a corrosion process, that could have 
  been caused at the manufacturing stage, or, as a result of exposure to environmental 
  elements.</p>
<p> [11] The theory of the Crown was that a wheel clamp, which was fastened by 
  a nut, had worn lose. The Crown submitted that the principal causes of wheel 
  stud breakage are factors that are within the control of the truck owner, including 
  improper maintenance. The Crown evidence suggested that hydrogen embrittlement 
  was an unlikely cause.</p>
<p> ANALYSIS</p>
<p> Section 11(d)</p>
<p> [12] The argument based on s. 11(d) of the Charter can be dealt with quickly. 
  As Professor Hogg points out in Constitutional Law of Canada, (Carswell, Toronto, 
  1997) vol. 2, p. 48-17, while s. 11(d) prohibits the reversal of the burden 
  of proof of a fact that is an element of the offence, that subsection says nothing 
  about elimination of an element. If the offence as drafted includes certain 
  elements or if s. 7 mandates proof of a certain element as a matter of fundamental 
  justice, placing the burden of proof of such elements on the defence may be 
  an unconstitutional violation of s. 11(d) subject to the Crown establishing 
  that the reversal is a reasonable limit under s. 1. However, there is no violation 
  of s. 11(d) because the legislature has defined an offence so as to eliminate 
  an element, or as here, a possible common law defence.</p>
<p> [13] The real and only constitutional issue in this case then is whether, 
  despite the wording of s. 84.1 of the HTA, s. 7 mandates that the defendants 
  be able to defend the case on the basis of due diligence. We therefore turn 
  to that issue.</p>
<p> Section 7</p>
<p> [14] Section 7 provides that: </p>
<p class="indent"> Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the 
  person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the 
  principles of fundamental justice.</p>
<p> [15] Although the rights guaranteed by s. 7 can only be enjoyed by human beings, 
  a corporation has standing to challenge the constitutionality of a penal provision 
  on the basis that the provision violates the s. 7 rights of a human being: R. 
  v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc., [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154. Thus, it is open to these 
  corporate defendants to challenge the constitutionality of s. 84.1 of the HTA.</p>
<p> [16] As the law now stands, a defendant alleging a violation of s. 7 must 
  establish both a violation of the right to life, liberty or security of the 
  person and that the deprivation of that right does not accord with the principles 
  of fundamental justice. The defendants properly concede that since there is 
  no possibility that an individual convicted of the offence can be either imprisoned 
  or placed on probation, s. 84.1 of the HTA does not violate any liberty interest 
  protected by s. 7. They do submit, however, that the provision infringes the 
  security of the person of an individual because it allows for the conviction 
  of a person who is without fault. Their submission of an infringement of the 
  security of the person is primarily based on the effect of the stigma attached 
  to a conviction together with the large possible monetary penalty, the highest 
  in the HTA.</p>
<p> R. v. Pontes</p>
<p> [17] The Crown's principal submission is that the Supreme Court of Canada 
  has already dealt with the issue of whether an absolute liability offence, with 
  no risk of imprisonment or probation, violates s. 7 of the Charter in R. v. 
  Pontes, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 44. In Pontes, the defendant was charged under s. 94(1) 
  of the British Columbia Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, with driving 
  a motor vehicle at a time when he was &quot;automatically and without notice&quot; 
  prohibited from doing so under s. 92 of that Act. A violation of s. 94 can result 
  in a fine and potential imprisonment. The Supreme Court of Canada held that 
  the wording &quot;automatically and without notice&quot; created an absolute 
  liability offence. However, the majority held that the offence did not violate 
  s. 7 of the Charter because s. 4.1 and s. 72(1) of the British Columbia Offence 
  Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 305, s. 4.1 provide that, notwithstanding the provisions 
  of any other Act, there can be no sanction of imprisonment attached to absolute 
  liability offences. Thus, at para. 9 of Pontes, Cory J. held as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Obviously, if the offence is one of absolute liability, but 
  there is no risk of imprisonment, then the provision will not offend s. 7 of 
  the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </p>
<p> [18] The defendants submit that in Pontes, the Supreme Court dealt only with 
  the liberty interest of s. 7 and not security of the person. It is not clear 
  that Pontes can be limited in that way. Thus, at para. 47, Cory J. held that 
  where the accused faces no risk of imprisonment, &quot;there is, accordingly, 
  no violation of the right to life, liberty and security of the person under 
  s. 7 of the Charter&quot; [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [19] On the other hand, at para, 26 Cory J. deals with the issue in less absolute 
  terms: &quot;Generally speaking, an offence of absolute liability is not likely 
  to offend s.7 of the Charter unless a prison sanction is provided&quot; [emphasis 
  added]. The Crown explains this language on the basis that the court has simply 
  left open the question of whether an absolute liability offence would infringe 
  s. 7 where the only possibility of imprisonment was as a result of the defendant's 
  failure to pay a fine. See Pontes at para. 16. That issue did not arise in Pontes 
  and does not arise in this case because of the terms of s. 84.1(4) of the HTA.</p>
<p> [20] For the purposes of this appeal, we are nevertheless prepared to proceed 
  on the basis that Pontes has not fully resolved the question of whether absolute 
  liability violates the guarantee to security of the person under s. 7. We will 
  therefore deal with the submissions of the defendants that s. 84.1 of the HTA 
  does violate the security of the person guarantee in s. 7.</p>
<p> Security of the person and absolute liability</p>
<p> [21] As indicated, the defendants submit that as a result of the combination 
  of the high maximum fine and the stigma attached to the s. 84.1 of the HTA offence, 
  a conviction for that offence results in the deprivation of security of the 
  person. They point out that s. 84.1 was enacted in response to a number of highly 
  publicized incidents and recommendations from inquests following the deaths 
  of motorists when wheels came loose from commercial vehicles. They argue that 
  a person convicted of this offence is stigmatized as someone who has exposed 
  innocent motorists or pedestrians to the risk of serious injury or death. They 
  also point out that the offence should be considered, not from the point of 
  view of a large trucking company, but that of an individual, possibly an owner/operator 
  with one commercial vehicle.</p>
<p> [22] In considering the constitutionality of s. 84.1, it is necessary to take 
  into account certain contextual factors. The section applies only to owners 
  and operators of commercial vehicles. These persons operate for profit in a 
  highly regulated industry. In R v. Ladouceur (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 22 at 39 
  (S.C.C.), Cory J. for the majority of the Supreme Court explained that driving 
  is a privilege and not a right: &quot;[I]t is fitting that governmental action 
  be taken to prevent or at least to lessen this carnage on our highways. Proper 
  laws and regulations are necessary to regulate the privilege of driving a motor 
  vehicle on public thoroughfares.&quot;</p>
<p> [23] Although s. 84.1 provides for a maximum fine of $50,000 and a minimum 
  fine of $2,000, under s. 59(2) of the Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. P. 33, in exceptional circumstances, the court may impose a fine that is 
  less than the minimum or suspend the sentence. The Crown points out that s. 
  84.1 has received a narrow interpretation from this court in Ontario (Minister 
  of Transport) v. Ryder Truck Rental Canada Ltd. (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 171 at 
  para. 16 (C.A.), where it was held that the offence only applies if a wheel 
  becomes detached and does not apply where the entire axle, hub, wheel and tire 
  assembly comes off in one piece. The Crown also concedes that although due diligence 
  is not available as a defence, certain other actus reus &quot;defences&quot; 
  would be available as where the wheel became detached in a collision caused 
  by a third party.</p>
<p> [24] While the courts have not fully defined the limits of security of the 
  person in s. 7, there are certain propositions established by the cases. In 
  Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307 at 
  para. 57, Bastarache J. speaking for the majority held that, &quot;[N]ot all 
  state interference with an individual's psychological integrity will engage 
  s. 7. Where the psychological integrity of a person is at issue, security of 
  the person is restricted to 'serious state-imposed psychological stress'&quot;. 
  Thus, &quot;[N]ot all forms of psychological prejudice caused by government 
  will lead to automatic s. 7 violations.&quot; Further, there is no &quot;generalized 
  right to dignity, or more specifically, a right to free from stigma&quot; (para. 
  57) and, &quot;[d]ignity and reputation are not self-standing rights. Neither 
  is freedom from stigma&quot; (para. 80).</p>
<p> [25] In Blencoe, the concern was with the lengthy delay in dealing with a 
  human rights complaint, a proceeding that according to the respondent Blencoe, 
  had ruined his reputation. Bastarache J. held at para. 83 that it would only 
  be in &quot;exceptional cases where the state interferes in profoundly intimate 
  and personal choices of an individual that state-caused delay in human rights 
  proceedings could trigger the s. 7 security of the person interest &#133; they 
  would not easily include the type of stress, anxiety and stigma that result 
  from administrative or civil proceedings.&quot;</p>
<p> [26] There are admittedly distinctions between the Blencoe context and the 
  context of these cases. In particular, the defendants here are charged with 
  quasi-criminal offences and required to appear in open court to face the charges. 
  We also take the point that this offence was enacted in response to a serious 
  public safety issue &quot;in the wake of several serious incidents of 'flying 
  truck wheels'&quot;. See Ryder Truck Rental, supra, at para. 1.</p>
<p> [27] However, we are not convinced that a prosecution for the s. 84.1 offence 
  engages the kind of exceptional state-induced psychological stress, even for 
  an individual, that would trigger the security of the person guarantee in s. 
  7. The offence does not create a true crime, and like most regulatory offences, 
  it focuses on the harmful consequences of otherwise lawful conduct rather than 
  any moral turpitude. Thus, in Wholesale Travel, supra, at p. 224, Cory J. rejected 
  the accused's claim that conviction for false advertising carried the stigma 
  of dishonesty. In that case, where due diligence was available, the court characterized 
  the fault element as one of &quot;negligence rather than one involving moral 
  turpitude&quot; and thus, &quot;any stigma that might flow from a conviction 
  is very considerably diminished.&quot; The same can be said in this case. The 
  s. 84.1 offence focuses on the unintended but harmful consequences of the commercial 
  trucking industry. We reject the proposition that a defendant charged with this 
  offence is stigmatized as a person operating in a wanton manner, heedless of 
  the extreme dangers to life and limb posed by his or her operation. Conviction 
  for the offence at most implies negligence and like the misleading advertising 
  offence considered in Wholesale Travel, any stigma is very considerably diminished. 
</p>
<p> [28] The diminished stigma attached to the s. 84.1 offence is not sufficient 
  to trigger the security interest in s. 7 even when coupled with the possibility 
  of a significant fine. This is simply not the kind of serious state-imposed 
  psychological stress that is intended to be covered by security of the person. 
  It is qualitatively different than the kinds of stresses that have been recognized 
  in the cases. A review of those cases demonstrates a concern with state action 
  that intrudes in an intimate and profound way as in New Brunswick (Minister 
  of Health and Community Services) v. G. (J.), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 46 (attempt to 
  take a child away from its parents); Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney 
  General), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519 (criminal prohibition on assisting suicide for 
  a desperately ill patient) and R v. Morgentaler, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 30 (regulating 
  abortion).</p>
<p> [29] The right to security of the person does not protect the individual operating 
  in the highly regulated context of commercial trucking for profit from the ordinary 
  stress and anxieties that a reasonable person would suffer as a result of government 
  regulation of that industry. As Lamer C.J.C. said in G. (J.) at para 59, &quot;[I]f 
  the right were interpreted with such broad sweep, countless government initiatives 
  could be challenged on the ground that they infringe the right to security of 
  the person, massively expanding the scope of judicial review, and, in the process, 
  trivializing what it means for a right to be constitutionally protected.&quot;</p>
<p> [30] Accordingly, s. 84.1 of the HTA does not violate s. 7. It is therefore 
  unnecessary to consider whether any violation could be saved by s. 1.</p>
<p> DISPOSITION</p>
<p> [31] The appeal by the defendant William Cameron Trucking is dismissed. The 
  appeal by the Crown in Transport Robert is allowed, the order for a new trial 
  set aside and a conviction entered. Particularly in light of the evidence led 
  by the defendant concerning its attempts at preventing the loss of wheels, we 
  agree with the Crown that the proper disposition would be imposition of the 
  minimum fine of $2,000. The defendant will have 30 days to pay the fine.</p>
