<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The applicants move for a stay pending an application for leave to appeal 
  to the Supreme Court of Canada from an order of this court refusing leave to 
  appeal a decision from the Divisional Court. The Divisional Court dismissed 
  an appeal from a decision of the Licence Appeal Tribunal, which had dismissed 
  the applicants' appeal from the proposal of the Director to revoke the 
  applicants' motor vehicle inspection licences.</p>
<p>
  [2] The applicants have not satisfied me on either the first or third prong 
  of the test set out in R.J.R. MacDonald Inc.</p>
<p>
  [3] An applicant for a stay must demonstrate that there is a serious question 
  to be tried, in this case a serious question to be determined by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada on the leave application. The applicants raise a number of issues 
  relating to the fairness of the hearing before the Tribunal and the quality 
  of the reasons of the Tribunal. It is noteworthy that all of those arguments 
  were thoroughly reviewed and rejected by the Divisional Court in an appeal brought 
  under s. 96(12) of the Highway Traffic Act. The Divisional Court recognized 
  that the section conferred a broad power of review and concluded: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Member's Reason have been criticized but they contain 
  the essential elements: a review of important evidence; findings of fact; and 
  a conclusion rooted in the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [4] A panel of three judges of this court denied the applicant leave to appeal 
  the decision of the Divisional Court. </p>
<p>
  [5] Although not conclusive, the two court decisions, adverse to the applicants, 
  are factors to be weighed in assessing the seriousness of the issues raised. 
  In addition, I am of the view that the issues raised by the applicants are such 
  that it is very unlikely that the applicants' motion for leave to the 
  Supreme Court of Canada will succeed.</p>
<p>
  [6] As to the third prong in R.J.R. MacDonald, I note that the licencing regime 
  in issue is directed at the protection of public safety. One tribunal and two 
  courts have ruled against the applicants' position. In my view, the balance 
  of convenience, which in this case includes the public interest, weighs against 
  granting the stay requested. </p>
<p>
  [7] The motion is, therefore, dismissed. The applicants are ordered to pay the 
  costs of the respondent fixed in the amount of $1,000, inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
