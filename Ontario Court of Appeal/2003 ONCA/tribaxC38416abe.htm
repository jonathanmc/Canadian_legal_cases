<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The parties agreed on the form of order in this case and included paragraph 
  1 which appears to be a final order. However, the issue decided by the motion 
  judge was to deny an injunction preventing the sale. The motion judge's reasons 
  for refusing the injunction are based on her view of the agreement, however, 
  those reasons do not amount to a final determination of the issue of the authority 
  of the majority to sell the property. Before us counsel agreed that the authority 
  issue is a live issue for trial. As a result, paragraph 1 of the order is struck 
  out. To that extent the appeal is allowed. Paragraph 4 denies the relief of 
  injunction.<br>
</p>
<P>[2] In light of counsel's agreement before us that the issue remains open and 
  that counsel did not consult on the issue before hand, costs of $3,000 to the 
  respondents.</p>
