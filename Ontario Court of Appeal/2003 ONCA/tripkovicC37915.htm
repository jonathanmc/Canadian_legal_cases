<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Joseph W. Quinn, of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, dated February 13, 2002 and April 23, 2002, reported at 16 C.P.C. 
  (5th) 163 and [2002] O.J. No. 1579.</p>
<p>
  GILLESE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Are clients entitled to an assessment of a solicitor's bill, on the basis 
  that the bill was not sufficiently particularized, several years after the bill 
  was paid? It is that question that lies at the heart of this appeal.</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [2] The applicant, Joanne Tripkovic (&quot;Tripkovic&quot;), resides in St. 
  Catharine's with her husband, Danny Tripkovic. Tripkovic suffered soft tissue 
  injuries in a motor vehicle accident in December 1988.</p>
<p>
  [3] Tripkovic retained Harry Daniel, Q.C. to act on behalf of herself and her 
  husband. Daniel issued two claims, one in respect of Tripkovic's tort claim 
  and one against her insurer for no-fault benefits.</p>
<p>
  [4] In February of 1994, Tripkovic alleged that Daniel over-charged her when 
  taking fees from an advance payment from the tort defendant and stated that 
  she was suspicious of Daniel's motives because Daniel often acted for Pilot 
  Insurance Company, the no-fault defendant. She dismissed Daniel and retained 
  the appellant, Saul I. Glober.</p>
<p>
  [5] Tripkovic was an extraordinarily demanding client. Throughout the time in 
  which Glober acted for the Tripkovics, Tripkovic was intimately and extensively 
  involved in every step of the proceedings. At her insistence, virtually nothing 
  was done and no step taken without thoroughly canvassing the same with her. 
  She received copies of all documents and was, at all times, fully involved in 
  the conduct of the two lawsuits.</p>
<p>
  [6] Once Glober was retained, he wrote to Daniel requesting the files. Daniel 
  responded with an account for the tort action in the amount of $10,700 for fees 
  and $2,627.70 in disbursements. Tripkovic insisted that Glober seek a reduction 
  in Daniel's account.</p>
<p>
  [7] Glober negotiated with the Daniel firm and, at an assignment court at which 
  the parties attended in order to set the date for an assessment of the account, 
  settled the matter when the Daniel firm agreed to reduce its fee account to 
  $5,000 plus the disbursements of $2,627.70 for a total of $7,627.70.</p>
<p>
  [8] Glober did not render a separate account for those services.</p>
<p>
  [9] Tripkovic also retained Glober to resolve a claim by Rose City Dodge Chrysler 
  Limited against her in which it was alleged that she owed $2,290 on the purchase 
  of an automobile. Glober defended the suit in Small Claims court and eventually 
  settled for $1,000, which was to be paid by Tripkovic from funds received in 
  the tort action.</p>
<p>
  [10] Glober did not render a separate account for those services.</p>
<p>
  [11] Tripkovic further retained Glober to act on her behalf in respect of a 
  dispute with Canada Pension Plan. Initially the Plan granted her a disability 
  pension due to the accident but later, it discontinued the pension. Glober performed 
  extensive services on this matter.</p>
<p>
  [12] Glober received no payment for his services on this matter nor did he render 
  a separate account for such services.</p>
<p>
  [13] In the spring and summer of 1996, as the tort action approached trial and 
  after multiple pre-trials, intensive settlement negotiations took place. The 
  Tripkovics were kept fully apprised of the negotiations.</p>
<p>
  [14] By written Offer to Settle dated June 26, 1996, the tort defendant offered 
  to settle all claims plus interest for $250,000, with costs to be agreed on 
  or settled.</p>
<p>
  [15] In early July 1996, the Tripkovics executed an Authorization and Direction 
  in respect of the tort action. Under its terms, Glober was to settle the tort 
  claim on a basis that would yield the Tripkovics the sum of $275,000 and Glober's 
  fees and disbursements were to be fully paid by the insurer. </p>
<p>
  [16] Following further negotiations, the tort action was settled later that 
  month (i.e. July of 1996) for $383,852.99.</p>
<p>
  [17] On July 30, 1996, Glober met with the Tripkovics and advised them of the 
  settlement. The Tripkovics signed a full and final release that disclosed that 
  the settlement was for $300,000 plus $83,852.99 for costs. Glober gave the Tripkovics 
  a cheque for $274,000, which was the previously agreed upon sum of $275,000 
  less the $1,000 owing under the Small Claims court settlement.</p>
<p>
  [18] The following day, Glober prepared his account, mailed it to the Tripkovics 
  and thereafter transferred the balance of the settlement funds to his general 
  account to pay for his fees and disbursements. The amount he received fell considerably 
  short of his solicitor and client fees. </p>
<p>
  [19] The bill that Glober sent to the Tripkovics reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">

  all matters connected with your automobile accident of December 16, 1988, against 
  Kathy Fisher and Gerry Fisher exclusively and not related in any way to the 
  related case of Tripkovic vs. State Farm Insurance. This account includes all 
  necessary consultations, correspondence and attendances with respect to the 
  above, and in particular, as to the specific agreement this date with you,</p>
<p>

<p>TOTAL FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS Transferred from trustBalance due &amp; owing 
  $94,788.07$94,788.07NIL</p>
<p>
  [20] The bill was accompanied by a letter from Glober to the Tripkovics which 
  reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> As discussed in person, I confirm the settlement of your claim 
  against Kathy Fisher and Gerry Fisher, which was completed pursuant to your 
  Authorization and Direction. I confirm that we are still proceeding with the 
  matter against State Farm for your no-fault benefits, and I will, of course, 
  keep you up to date as that matter progresses.</p>
<p class="indent">I am enclosing, for your records, as requested, a copy of my 
  brief account for services rendered on your behalf, as well as the Authorization 
  and Final Release. I have made the Account quite brief, as my fees and disbursements 
  have been discussed with you in person. If there is any more detail required, 
  please let me know and I will be happy to discuss this further. Trusting this 
  is satisfactory, I remain, </p>
<p>
  [21] In the year that followed settlement of the tort action, Glober dealt with 
  Tripkovic on a regular basis as he continued to work on the no-fault action 
  and the Canada Pension Plan dispute. She made no inquiry about his bill for 
  the tort action.</p>
<p>
  [22] On January 28, 1997, on the eve of trial, the no-fault action was settled 
  for $55,000 plus a cost contribution of $7,500 plus GST and disbursements. Tripkovic 
  signed a handwritten Authorization to Settle the no-fault action. </p>
<p>
  [23] The Tripkovics executed a full and final release in respect of the no-fault 
  action on March 4, 1997. In April of 1997, the Tripkovics received a cheque 
  for $55,000 from Glober. Glober did not bill the Tripkovics for the full cost 
  of his services on the no-fault action. Instead, he accepted the $7,500 cost 
  contribution from the insurer in full satisfaction of his fees on the no-fault 
  action.</p>
<p>
  [24] Glober prepared a bill for the no-fault action that was dated March 26th, 
  1997, and sent to the Tripkovics on July 4th, 1997. </p>
<p>
  [25] In the spring of 1997, Tripkovic drew to Glober's attention that he had 
  paid the disbursements of $2,627.70 to Daniel's firm despite the fact that she 
  had already paid for those disbursements. Glober confirmed that an error had 
  been made, obtained the overpayment from Daniel and reimbursed Tripkovic.</p>
<p>
  [26] In August of 1997, Glober received a letter from the Complaints Department 
  of the Law Society of Upper Canada indicating it had received a complaint from 
  Tripkovic that included an allegation that she had never received a copy of 
  his bill in the tort action. Glober provided the Law Society with a copy of 
  the original account that he had sent to the Tripkovics on or about July 31, 
  1996 and the trust reconciliation, which showed the repayment of $2,627.70 that 
  had been recovered from Daniel.</p>
<p>
  [27] On September 25, 1997, the Law Society forwarded a copy of the same to 
  the Tripkovics. </p>
<p>
  [28] On August 11, 1997, unbeknownst to Glober, Tripkovic obtained an order 
  for assessment of Glober's bills for both the tort and no-fault actions.</p>
<p>
  [29] In January 1998, the Tripkovics retained the services of Mr. Hanna to represent 
  them as counsel on the assessment of Glober's two bills. Hanna demanded that 
  Glober deliver to him the Tripkovics' files. Glober initially refused to do 
  so.</p>
<p>
  [30] Glober provided Hanna with the files in December of 1998. He did not keep 
  a copy of the files.</p>
<p>
  [31] There were various attendances before assessment officers over a 2-year 
  period, each of which led to an adjournment.</p>
<p>
  [32] In the transcript of an attendance before Assessment Officer Thomas dated 
  June 19, 1998, Thomas stated that Tripkovic was a sophisticated client. The 
  applications judge accepted the accuracy of that statement.</p>
<p>
  [33] In April of 1999, Glober took the position that the order for assessment 
  was defective. On April 26, 1999, Assessment Officer Cumming adjourned the matter 
  to October 26, 1999, and advised Hanna to proceed with an application to a judge 
  in Toronto for an order for assessment.</p>
<p>
  [34] By letter dated June 5, 2001, the Tripkovics fired Hanna. In July of 2001 
  they retained their current counsel.</p>
<p>
  [35] The application that is the subject matter of this appeal was issued on 
  August 15, 2001. Five affidavits were filed in the matter: the Tripkovic affidavit 
  sworn August 19, 2001; the Glober affidavit sworn August 30, 2001; the Tripkovic 
  affidavit sworn September 10, 2001; the joint affidavit of the Tripkovics sworn 
  November 20, 2001; and, the Glober affidavit sworn December 20, 2001. There 
  were no cross-examinations on any of the affidavits.</p>
<p>
  [36] The application claimed relief against both Glober and Hanna. The Hanna 
  matter did not proceed as Hanna consented to the relief sought against him.</p>
<p>
  [37] In Tripkovic's first affidavit, she said that she did not believe that 
  there was a retainer agreement between her and Glober. In his second affidavit, 
  Glober produced a copy of the retainer dated May 9, 1996, and signed by Tripkovic. 
  Among other things, the retainer agreement stipulates an hourly rate of $350 
  and a daily charge of $3,500 for discoveries. Glober deposed that he prepared 
  the retainer when he became uncomfortable with Tripkovic who had gloated to 
  him that she had succeeded in having a medical doctor disciplined.</p>
<p>
  [38] In her first affidavit, Tripkovic made no mention of the Authorization 
  and Direction that she had executed in respect of the tort action. Glober appended 
  a copy of an undated Authorization and Direction to his first affidavit. On 
  December 19, 2001, Glober's correspondence to the Tripkovics was returned to 
  him by Tripkovics' counsel. In the correspondence, Glober discovered a copy 
  of his letter dated July 31, 1996, which accompanied his tort account of the 
  same date and enclosed a copy of the executed Authorization and Final Release. 
  Glober provided the same as attachments to his second affidavit.</p>
<p>
  [39] In the third affidavit, the Tripkovics said that they had &quot;forgotten&quot; 
  that they had signed an Authorization and Direction.</p>
<p>
  [40] In his first affidavit, Glober also swore that Tripkovic accosted him on 
  the street on April 7, 1998, threatened him with bodily harm and suggested that 
  he &quot;check her brother's criminal record&quot;. Glober reported the incident 
  to the Hamilton-Wentworth Police Department. On the same day, Tripkovic left 
  a note on the windshield of Glober's car that stated, among other things, that 
  her goal was to see him disbarred. A copy of the note was attached to his affidavit.</p>
<p>
  [41] Tripkovic's version of events surrounding settlement of the tort action 
  changed dramatically between her first and third affidavits. Both versions were 
  proven to be untruthful, as the applications judge found, in part by Glober's 
  production in his second affidavit of, among other things, a cancelled cheque 
  for $274,000 showing that Tripkovic had cashed it on July 30, 1996.</p>
<p>
  [42] The applications judge found that Tripkovic swore to a number of untruths. 
  Among other things, he found that Tripkovic was &quot;mistaken&quot; in her 
  first affidavit when she swore that she had executed no retainer and that Tripkovic 
  was not to be believed in respect of her sworn testimony that she made a number 
  of requests of Glober for an accounting of both actions. The judge noted the 
  inherent improbability of the truth of such a statement without a single confirming 
  letter.</p>
<p>
  [43] In relation to the Tripkovics statement that they had &quot;forgotten&quot; 
  about the Authorization and Direction in the tort action, the applications judge 
  said, &quot;It is difficult to understand why the applicants would not have 
  remembered this important document.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [44] The applications judge found Tripkovic to be not credible in her evidence 
  and &quot;entirely mistaken about the sequence of events&quot;. He said that 
  she was not to be believed when she swore that she executed a full and final 
  release in blank on July 31, 1996, at Katz Restaurant. In fact, the applications 
  judge found that &quot;The whole story about the meeting on July 31 was a patent 
  falsehood.&quot; </p>
<p>
  The Relevant Legislation</p>
<p>
  [45] In the balance of the judgment, ss. 2(3), 3, 4 and 11 of the Solicitors 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15, are frequently referred to. For convenience, they 
  are set out now.</p>
<p class="indent"> 2. (3) A solicitor's bill of fees, charges or disbursements 
  is sufficient in form if it contains a reasonable statement or description of 
  the services rendered with a lump sum charge therefore together with a detailed 
  statement of disbursements, and in any action upon or assessment of such a bill 
  if it is deemed proper further details of the services rendered may be ordered. 
</p>
<p class="indent">3. Where the retainer of the solicitor is not disputed and there 
  are no special circumstances, an order may be obtained on requisition from a 
  local registrar of the Ontario Court (General Division),</p>
<p class="indent">(a) by the client, for the delivery and assessment of the solicitor's 
  bill;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) by the client, for the assessment of a bill already delivered, 
  within one month from its delivery;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) by the solicitor, for the assessment of a bill already delivered, 
  at any time after the expiration of one month from its delivery, if no order 
  for its assessment has been previously made.</p>
<p class="indent">4. (1) No such reference shall be directed upon an application 
  made by the party chargeable with such bill after a verdict or judgment has 
  been obtained, or after twelve months from the time such bill was delivered, 
  sent or left as aforesaid, except under special circumstances to be proved to 
  the satisfaction of the court or judge to whom the application for the reference 
  is made.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where the reference is made under subsection (1), the court 
  or judge, in making it, may give any special directions relative to its costs. 
</p>
<p class="indent">11. The payment of a bill does not preclude the court from referring 
  it for assessment, if the application is made within twelve months after payment, 
  and if the special circumstances of the case, in the opinion of the court, appear 
  to require the assessment.</p>
<p>
  The Decision Below</p>
<p>
  [46] Section 11 of the Act precludes a court from referring for assessment a 
  bill that has been paid, unless an application is made within 12 months after 
  payment of the bill. </p>
<p>
  [47] The applications judge found that the no-fault bill met the requirements 
  of s. 2(3) of the Act and that s. 11 was a complete bar to its assessment, more 
  than 12 months having passed since payment. As a result, he dismissed the application 
  for an assessment of the no-fault bill.</p>
<p>
  [48] The applications judge took a different view of the tort action bill. He 
  concluded that a bill lacking sufficient particularity does not qualify as a 
  bill under the Act. He found that the tort action bill fell short of what is 
  required by s. 2(3) of the Act and, therefore, that it was not a bill for the 
  purposes of s. 11 of the Act. As a consequence, in his view, time never began 
  to run under s. 11 and the applicants were entitled to have the bill referred 
  for assessment. He ordered Glober to deliver a fresh tort bill that complied 
  with s. 2(3) of the Act and, once delivered, the bill was referred for assessment.</p>
<p>
  [49] The applications judge made no award as to costs. In coming to that decision, 
  the applications judge referred to the fact that success was divided and to 
  the &quot;sworn untruths&quot; of the applicants that &quot;touched upon important 
  issues and were deliberate&quot;. He concluded, at para. 65, that </p>
<p class="indent"> It is because of the sworn untruths of the applicants that 
  I think they should be deprived of the party-and-party costs to which they otherwise 
  would be entitled.</p>
<p>
  The Issues</p>
<p>
  [50] The appellant appeals from the order referring the tort bill for assessment. 
  In addition, he seeks leave to appeal from the order as to costs and, if leave 
  is granted, he asks that costs of the proceeding below be awarded against the 
  respondents &quot;on the appropriate indemnity scale&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [51] The respondents ask, by way of cross-appeal, that costs of the proceeding 
  below be awarded against the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [52] In order to decide this appeal, the following three issues must be addressed: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Does s. 11 apply to the tort bill so as to bar the court 
  from referring it for assessment? <br>
  2. Does the tort bill meet the requirements of s. 2(3) of the Act?<br>
  3. Ought the costs award below be set aside and costs of the application be 
  ordered as against either party to the application?</p>
<p>Issue 1: Does section 11 of the Act apply to the tort bill?</p>
<p>
  [53] The relevant portion of s.11 provides that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The payment of a bill does not preclude the court from referring it for assessment, 
  if the application is made within twelve months after payment &#133;</p>
<p>
  [54] Payment of the tort bill occurred on or about July 31, 1996. The application 
  for assessment of the tort bill was made in August of 2001, some 5 years after 
  the bill was paid. Even if the Tripkovics first received the bill from the Law 
  Society in September of 1997, the application was made almost 4 years after 
  they received the bill. I add that, in my view, it is highly improbable that 
  the Tripkovics did not receive the bill shortly after its date of July 31, 1996, 
  given that they offer no explanation for how they became aware of the overpayment 
  to Daniel, an item which was disclosed on the bill and not otherwise and which 
  Tripkovic raised with Glober in the spring of 1997.</p>
<p> [55] On a plain reading of s. 11, there can be no doubt but that it applies. 
  Payment occurred on July 31, 1996, by means of a transfer of trust funds; the 
  application for assessment was not made within the ensuing 12-month period. 
  It follows that, absent fraud or gross misconduct which are not alleged<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>, 
  the court below was precluded from referring the bill for assessment.</p>
<p>
  [56] Interpretation of legislation is to be performed contextually. Thus, it 
  is necessary to consider s. 11 in accordance with the scheme and purposes of 
  the Act. The purpose of ss. 2(3), 3, 4 and 11 is to provide assistance to both 
  clients and solicitors in relation to bills rendered by solicitors. They reflect 
  a balance between the legitimate need of clients to challenge accounts in an 
  expeditious way with the equally legitimate need of solicitors to be paid for 
  their services.</p>
<p>
  [57] A client may obtain an order for particulars of a bill, in an action upon 
  or assessment of a solicitor's bill, pursuant to s. 2(3). Section 3(a) provides 
  assistance to a client who has duly retained a solicitor but the solicitor has 
  failed to provide the client with a bill. Pursuant to that provision, the client 
  can obtain delivery and assessment of the solicitor's bill through an order 
  of a local registrar. Section 3(b) empowers a client to move for an order from 
  a local registrar for the assessment of a bill, so long as he or she does so 
  within a month of delivery of the bill. A solicitor may move, pursuant to s. 
  3(c), for assessment of a bill a month after its delivery, so long as no assessment 
  order has previously been made.</p>
<p>
  [58] Section 11 governs the situation where a client pays a bill yet wishes 
  to have the bill assessed. In such a situation, the client must apply to a court 
  within 12 months of payment and show special circumstances sufficient to persuade 
  the court to order the assessment. From the client's perspective, s. 11 provides 
  a mechanism to obtain an assessment of a bill that has been paid where some 
  time has passed. Section 11 also provides assistance to the solicitor, as it 
  brings some finality to those situations in which clients have paid their bills. 
  The rights of the client and the needs of the solicitor are balanced through 
  the legislative choice of a 12-month period coupled with the requirement for 
  special circumstances. </p>
<p>
  [59] A contextual and purposive interpretation of s. 11 accords with a plain 
  reading of its provisions.</p>
<p>
  [60] However, a number of decisions of lower courts stand for the proposition 
  that s. 11 is not to be given its plain meaning. Such cases have held that a 
  bill that is insufficiently particularized so as to meet the requirements of 
  s. 2(3) is not a bill such that time begins to run for the purposes of s. 11. 
  Time begins to run under s. 11 only after a bill in compliance with s. 2(3) 
  has been delivered and deduction of the amount of the account from proceeds 
  held in trust does not amount to payment of the account within the meaning of 
  s. 11. See, for example, St. Jean v. Girones, Ciccone, Wallbridge and Wallbridge 
  , [1993] O.J. No. 2662 (Gen. Div.), Wells v. Biback, [1996] O.J. No. 2337 (Gen. 
  Div.) and Ek-Udofia v. Hopkins, [1997] O.J. No. 76 (Gen. Div.). </p>
<p>
  [61] On this view, a client could have a generalised bill assessed 5, 10 or 
  50 years after it was paid. No special circumstances would have to be shown 
  as the bill would not be a bill and time could not run under s. 11. </p>
<p>
  [62] A consideration of the general operation of ss. 2(3), 3 and 11 and of the 
  specific circumstances of the case at bar show that a plain reading of s. 11 
  is warranted. Let us begin with a consideration of the consequences of holding 
  that a bill lacking in sufficient particularity is not a bill. In my view, such 
  a view produces unworkable and unrealistic results. For example, would a client 
  who receives such a bill be unable to obtain an order for further details pursuant 
  to s. 2(3) of the Act? Section 2(3) speaks of an action or assessment upon a 
  solicitor's &quot;bill&quot;. If such a bill is not a bill, a client could not 
  obtain an order for assessment pursuant to s.3 (b) of the Act as it applies 
  to &quot;bills&quot;. If such a bill is not a bill, a client could not rely 
  upon it to make application to the court pursuant to s. 4(1), as that section 
  also refers to &quot;bills&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [63] Surely, there must be a difference between the situation where a bill lacking 
  in particularity is rendered - which would trigger the right to request details 
  pursuant to s. 2(3) and to request an assessment under s. 3(b) or 4(1) - and 
  that envisaged by s.3 (a) where no bill is rendered and the client may request 
  delivery and assessment of the same. These observations show the fallacy in 
  the argument that to treat the Glober bill as a &quot;bill&quot; for the purposes 
  of s. 11 would require one to give it a meaning different than it bears elsewhere 
  in the Act. Treating the Glober bill as a bill for the purposes of s. 11 is 
  consistent with treating it as bill for the purposes of obtaining details pursuant 
  to s. 2(3) or an assessment pursuant to ss. 3(b) or 4(1).</p>
<p>
  [64] Turning then to a consideration of the case at bar, in my view a plain 
  reading of s. 11 accords with both common sense and fairness. From a commonsensical 
  point of view, failure to provide a detailed bill is completely understandable 
  in the case at bar. A detailed bill enables clients to know what services have 
  been performed on their behalf. Tripkovic was a sophisticated client who had 
  been deeply involved in the tort litigation process. She was aware of, and had 
  participated in, the conduct of every step of the process. She had executed 
  the retainer that set out Glober's hourly rates. The Authorization and Direction 
  made clear the terms upon which the settlement of the action was to be concluded. 
  At the time that it was executed, the services had been rendered. The full and 
  final release referred to the settlement terms. She was invited, by letter accompanying 
  the bill, to ask for details if she wished particulars. She made no such requests.</p>
<p>
  [65] Another reason for sending a bill is to trigger payment. Here, as the Tripkovics 
  well knew, they were not responsible for paying Glober's fees. The Authorization 
  and Direction made it clear that they were to receive $275,000 by way of settlement 
  and Glober was to look to the insurer for recovery of his fees. </p>
<p>
  [66] Yet another reason for requiring a detailed bill is to enable a client 
  to have it independently scrutinised by a third party professional, whether 
  solicitor or taxing officer, to determine whether the bill was reasonable. The 
  absence of detail in the Glober tort action bill precluded such scrutiny. But, 
  it must be noted that the legislation never intended to give clients an unfettered 
  right to an assessment. It specifically limited a client's right to have a paid 
  bill assessed to a period of 12 months following payment of a bill and then, 
  only in special circumstances. </p>
<p>
  [67] The need for a detailed bill did not exist as the Tripkovics were aware 
  of the services that had been rendered on their behalf and they were not responsible 
  for paying the bill. The right to have the bill assessed was not unlimited. 
  For 12 months after payment of the bill, the Tripkovics had the right to move 
  for an order for details (s. 2(3)) or, subject to satisfying the court of special 
  circumstances, an assessment (s. 11).</p>
<p>
  [68] Turning next to fairness considerations, I begin by noting that Tripkovic's 
  conduct in the year following payment of the tort bill was tantamount to condonation. 
  For a year after the bill was paid, with Tripkovic's full concurrence and approval, 
  Glober continued to work on her behalf on the no-fault and pension matters.</p>
<p>
  [69] Glober achieved an excellent result on both the tort and the no-fault actions. 
  Overall, the Tripkovics obtained $400,000 for a soft tissue injury with all 
  associated legal costs being paid from other funds. In addition, several other 
  legal matters were resolved on Tripkovic's behalf including settlement of Daniel's 
  fee and the claim by Rose Auto and pursuit of the pension dispute.</p>
<p>
  [70] It is unreasonable and unjust to order the assessment of a bill years after 
  the bill was paid, at the request of a sophisticated client who was fully apprised 
  of all steps taken in an action on her behalf, never sought particulars of a 
  bill although invited to do so, made no inquiry about the bill within the statutorily 
  ordained period, actively condoned payment of the bill and permitted the solicitor 
  to continue to work on her behalf in reliance on that condonation. </p>
<p>
  [71] In my view, the cases in which generalised bills were held not to be bills 
  for the purposes of time running pursuant to s. 11 have been incorrectly decided. 
  The error stems from a misplaced reliance upon the early cases of Petty v. Murphy 
  (1926), 59 O.L.R. 209 (Sup. Ct.) and Re Sternig (1977), 4 C.P.C. 221 (Ont. Sup. 
  Ct.). Petty v. Murphy involves an action by a solicitor based on s. 2(3), not 
  s. 11. Section 2(3) is discussed below but even a cursory review of its provisions 
  shows that its purpose and wording is markedly different than that of s. 11. 
  Nor is Sternig decided on the basis of s. 11. In Sternig, s. 4(1) is in issue. 
  Factually, Sternig is very different than the case at bar. In Sternig, the first 
  &quot;bill&quot; blended fees and disbursements so that it could not be known 
  what portion of the &quot;bill&quot; related to fees. That is a clear violation 
  of s. 2(3). Moreover, the client alleged fraud in Sternig. </p>
<p>
  [72] A careful reading of the cases cited by the respondents as authority for 
  the proposition that a generalised bill does not trigger the operation of s. 
  11 are in fact cases in which a solicitor is taking action under s. 2(3) (e.g. 
  Petty, supra., Ek-Udofia, supra), which involve fraud (e.g. Re Bookman &amp; 
  Harris v. Matravers 28 O.R.(2d) 607 (H.C.J.) or where no bill of account was 
  ever sent (e.g. St. Jean, supra.)</p>
<p>
  [73] This is not a case of a solicitor suing on his account. Nor is it a case 
  where a client never received a bill or alleges fraud. It is a case in which 
  a solicitor obtained excellent results for a sophisticated client, with the 
  approval of the client saw that his account was paid by means of recovery on 
  the actions and continued to do further work to good effect for the client who, 
  years later, ambushed him. In the circumstances, s. 11 applies to preclude the 
  court from referring it for assessment.</p>
<p>
  Issue #2: Does the tort bill meet the requirements of s. 2(3) of the Act? </p>
<p>
  [74] The appellant asks this court to find that, in any event, the tort bill 
  meets the requirements of s. 2(3) of the Act.</p>
<p>
  [75] Section 2(3) provides that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A solicitor's bill &#133; is sufficient in form if it contains a reasonable 
  statement or description of the services rendered with a lump sum charge therefore 
  together with a detailed statement of disbursements.</p>
<p>
  [76] This court established the test for determining whether a bill is &quot;sufficient 
  in form&quot; in Boland v. Bunker Hill Extension Mines Ltd., [1944] 1 D.L.R. 
  692 (Ont. C.A.) at pp. 694 - 5 as: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; the contents of the bill must at the same time show sufficient information 
  to enable a Taxing Officer of the Court to determine whether such charge is 
  or is not reasonable for the services rendered. </p>
<p>
  [77] The British Columbia Court of Appeal considered the Boland test in Wright 
  v. Wright, [1984] B.C.J. No. 1892 (C.A.) and, at para.12, rejected it saying: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The words &quot;reasonably descriptive&quot; do not require that the bill set 
  out an elaborate description of the services performed or that the bill be in 
  such form as will enable the client's solicitor to advise him on the reasonableness 
  of the bill. In this respect I disagree with the reasons given in Boland. </p>
<p>
  [78] Boland was decided in 1944. In my view, it is time for the test to be revisited. 
  Bills lacking in particulars are not unknown in the practice of law and there 
  are situations, in my view, where a generalised form of bill is sufficient. 
  In making such comments, it should not be taken that I am suggesting that generalized 
  bills are generally acceptable. Clearly, much legal work is performed in situations 
  where a bill with sufficient particulars is required so that the client is both 
  informed of the services rendered on his or her behalf and able to obtain advice 
  as to the reasonableness and propriety of the bill. Equally clearly, there are 
  situations in which a generalised form of bill is sufficient. What is &quot;sufficient 
  in form&quot; and gives a &quot;reasonable statement or description of the services 
  rendered&quot; is surely dependent upon the context and any new formulation 
  of the test must take that into account.</p>
<p>
  [79] Such a reconsideration of the test is more properly undertaken in a case 
  in which s. 2(3) is central to the result and where the matter has been fully 
  argued. The instant case turns upon the applicability of s. 11 and, in light 
  of the conclusion reached thereon, the question of whether the bill satisfies 
  the requirements of s. 2(3) of the Act need not be decided.</p>
<p>
  [80] It will be apparent from the discussion of the relevant legislative provisions 
  undertaken in the foregoing section that, in my view, even if the tort bill 
  were insufficient in form to meet the requirements of s. 2(3), there is nothing 
  inconsistent in finding it sufficient for the purposes of s. 11.</p>
<p>
  [81] The appellant argued that s. 2(3) is solely a restraint that applies to 
  solicitors bringing actions on their accounts. In light of the conclusion reached 
  upon s. 11, I need not decide this matter. I would, however, offer the observation 
  that such an interpretation appears to fly in the face of the express language 
  of the concluding portion of s. 2(3) which provides for assessments as well 
  as actions in the following words: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; and in any action upon or assessment of such a bill if it is deemed proper 
  further details of the services rendered may be ordered. [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  Issue 3: Costs of the application </p>
<p> [82] When an appeal is allowed and, as in the instant appeal, the appellant 
  has asked that the costs order below be set aside, the general principle is 
  that the costs order at trial is set aside and costs at trial and on appeal 
  are awarded to the successful appellant. The court has a discretion to depart 
  from this approach in unusual circumstances. See Kopij v. Toronto (Metropolitan), 
  [1999] O.J. No. 239 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [83] When the Tripkovics made their application, the prevailing law on s. 11 
  was in their favour. The decision to overturn the lower court jurisprudence 
  can fairly be termed &quot;unusual circumstances&quot; such that this court 
  must consider whether to exercise its discretion and depart from the general 
  principle. See McLaren v. Caldwell (1881), 6 O.A.R. 456 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [84] In exercising its discretion, the court must be mindful of the competing 
  consideration raised by the appellant namely the applications judge's finding 
  that Tripkovic had given false evidence. In oral argument, the appellant argued 
  that in light of such findings, costs of the application should be awarded against 
  the respondents on a solicitor and client basis. </p>
<p>
  [85] In my view, there is a good argument to be made that the circumstances 
  of the case at bar warrant a costs award on a solicitor and client basis. Tripkovic 
  has been found to have deliberately told the court untruths about important 
  matters in issue. In addition, there was uncontroverted evidence before the 
  applications judge that Tripkovic had threatened Glober in the course of the 
  proceedings. Misconduct of this significance and severity warrants court sanction. 
  </p>
<p>
  [86] However, it is my view that while the appellant, who has been wholly successful 
  on appeal, should be entitled to the costs of the proceeding below, a party 
  and party basis is the appropriate scale given the competing considerations 
  at play.</p>
<p>
  [87] In light of the results on appeal, the respondents' cross appeal in which 
  they seek costs of the application, is dismissed. I would have dismissed the 
  cross appeal, in any event, for the following reasons.</p>
<p>
  [88] The foundation of the respondents' cross appeal was that the applications 
  judge erred in concluding that Tripkovic was untruthful. In making this argument, 
  the respondents canvassed the applications judge's findings on the Authorization 
  and Direction, the release, and the requests for an accounting of the two actions, 
  and offered comments as to why a different view of Tripkovic's evidence could 
  be taken. In light of those comments, they submit that the applications judge 
  unreasonably concluded that Tripkovic had given false evidence.</p>
<p>
  [89] The applications judge's findings of fact are to be accorded a high degree 
  of deference, even where no oral evidence was heard. In my view, the respondents 
  failed to demonstrate that the applications judge made any error in his findings. 
  There is nothing in the alternate view of the evidence proposed by the respondents 
  that supports their contention that the applications judge erred in his apprehension 
  of the evidence. On the record before the applications judge, it was open to 
  him to make the findings that he did. In my view, his findings are so fully 
  supported by the record that they could be termed inescapable.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [90] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, grant leave to appeal the costs 
  award and allow the costs appeal. I would award the appellant costs of the proceeding 
  below, on a party and party basis, as assessed, and costs of the appeal fixed 
  in the amount of $12,500.</p>
<p>
  [91] I would dismiss the cross appeal.</p>
