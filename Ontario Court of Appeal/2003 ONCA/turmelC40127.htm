<p>On appeal from the decision of Justice Catherine Aitken of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated May 26, 2003.</p>

<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] On May 14, 2003 Mr. Turmel was charged with possession of marihuana for 
  the purposes of trafficking pursuant to s. 5(2) of the <em>Controlled Drugs 
  and Substances Act</em>, S.C. 1996, c.19 (the <em>CDSA</em>).</p>
<p>
  [2] On May 26, 2003 Mr. Turmel brought a motion in the Superior Court of Justice 
  seeking in effect to have this charge stayed. Aitken J. dismissed the motion 
  and Mr. Turmel now appeals from her order.</p>
<p> [3] He makes only one argument. It is founded on the order made by this court 
  in<em> R. v. Parker</em> (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 193 declaring the marihuana 
  prohibition in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em> to be invalid and suspending the declaration 
  for 12 months. Mr. Turmel says that since s. 4 prohibits possession of any substance 
  included in, <em>inter alia</em> Schedule II (which lists marihuana) this court's 
  declaration can only be effected (now that the 12 months has passed) by deleting 
  marihuana from Schedule II. He argues that this must remove marihuana from Schedule 
  II for all purposes. Section 5(2), like s. 4, relies on the listing of marihuana 
  in Schedule II to create the charge of possession of marihuana for the purposes 
  of trafficking. Mr. Turmel says that the <em>Parker</em> declaration means that 
  there was no such charge on May 26, 2003, since it deletes marihuana from Schedule 
  II.</p>
<p>
  [4] While there are questions about whether this motion was properly brought, 
  and whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction to hear it, we prefer to deal 
  with this appeal by addressing directly the argument made by Mr. Turmel.</p>
<p> [5] It is based on a fundamental misconception. A declaration does not delete 
  a provision from a statute. Pursuant to s. 52(1) of the <em>Constitution Act, 
  1982</em> its effect is to render the provision of no force or effect to the 
  extent of its inconsistency with the provisions of the Constitution.</p>
<p> [6] The declaration of invalidity made by this court in <em>Parker&cedil; 
  supra</em>, does not delete marihuana from Schedule II of the <em>CDSA</em>. 
  It simply declares that the reference to marihuana in Schedule II is of no force 
  or effect for the purposes of the possession charge in s. 4 of the <em>CDSA</em>. 
  The declaration does not extend to any other section of the<em> CDSA</em>. In 
  particular, it does not diminish the effect of the listing of marihuana in Schedule 
  II for the purposes of s. 5(2) of the <em>CDSA</em>. As a result, the charge 
  of possession of marihuana for the purposes of trafficking existed on May 26, 
  2003.</p>
<p>
  [7] Thus Aitken J. was correct to dismiss the appellant's argument and we would 
  dismiss his appeal.</p>
