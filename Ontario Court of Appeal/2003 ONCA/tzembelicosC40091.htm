<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are far from persuaded that the applications judge erred in the exercise 
  of his discretion in dismissing the application and in granting relief on the 
  counter application.</p>
<p>[2] The record fully supports his finding of a partnership. The partners, as 
  beneficiaries of the trust of the lands, would have an interest in the land 
  sufficient to enable them to bring an application under the Partition Act. That 
  interest, however, is not a possessory one and, therefore, does not give a corresponding 
  prima facie right to partition or sale. </p>
<p>[3] For these reasons the applications judge, in the exercise of his discretion, 
  was entitled to take into account all of the competing interests and grant relief 
  on the counter petition, the benefits of which he enumerated.</p>
<p>[4] With respect to costs, it appears to us that, given the history of acrimony 
  that existed among the four brothers, it was highly unlikely that this matter 
  could have been settled on any basis. It was, therefore, necessary that the 
  matter be resolved by the court. In these circumstances, we think that to award 
  substantial indemnity costs against one of the four brothers is an unduly harsh 
  result.</p>
<p>[5] Accordingly, the appeal on the merits is dismissed. Leave to appeal the 
  costs disposition is granted and the costs award is varied to $10,000 including 
  disbursements and G.S.T. The respondents are entitled to the costs of the appeal, 
  which, in light of the divided success on the appeal, we fix at $5,000.</p>
