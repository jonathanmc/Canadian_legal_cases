<p>On appeal from the order of Justice John A. Desotti of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated February 11, 2003.</p>
<p>DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [1] The respondents (the &quot;Ungers&quot;) were passengers in an automobile 
  that was in an accident with a truck driven by the defendant, James Riccia, 
  an employee of Darcy Matthews. The truck was owned by Matthews or his business, 
  Matthews Pallet Recycling. The Ungers sued Isaac Unger the driver of their vehicle, 
  James Riccia, Darcy Matthews, and Matthews Pallet Recycling. At the relevant 
  time, Mr. Matthews and his employee were covered under an automobile insurance 
  policy issued by Pilot Insurance Company (&quot;Pilot&quot;). Mr. Matthews' 
  business was also covered by a commercial general liability policy (CGL) issued 
  by Co-Operators General Insurance Company (&quot;Co-Operators&quot;). Pilot 
  accepted that it had a duty to defend at least some of the claims brought by 
  the Ungers. Co-Operators took the position that none of the claims fell within 
  its coverage. Pilot brought a motion under Rule 21 of the Rules of Civil Procedure 
  to determine whether Co-Operators had a duty to defend any of the claims brought 
  by the Ungers. </p>
<p>
  [2] The motion judge concluded that paragraphs 36-39 of the statement of claim 
  alleged what he described as &quot;negligent business conduct&quot;. He held 
  that these allegations were distinct from the allegations pertaining to the 
  negligent use, ownership, or operation of the Matthews vehicle. Relying on Derksen 
  v. 539938 Ontario Ltd. (2001), 205 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.), the motion judge 
  concluded that where a claim alleges concurrent causes, an insurer is obliged 
  to defend if it is possible that any of the causes of action are covered by 
  the insurer's policy. The motion judge recognized that Co-Operators' policy 
  excluded damages to persons or property arising out of the use, ownership, or 
  operation of a motor vehicle. The policy did not, however, exclude damages arising 
  out of negligent business practices allegations. Consequently, according to 
  the motion judge, Co-Operators was obligated to defend those allegations on 
  behalf of Matthews and his business. </p>
<p>
  [3] I would allow the appeal. In my view, all of the allegations made in the 
  statement of claim relate to the ownership, use or operation of the vehicle 
  owned by Matthews and operated by his employee. The allegations fall within 
  either or both of the exclusions from coverage relied on by Co-Operators and 
  are, therefore, not covered by its policy. Co-Operators has no duty to defend.</p>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  [4] For the purposes of determining whether Co-Operators has a duty to defend, 
  the factual allegations in the statement of claim are assumed to be true: Non-Marine 
  Underwriters, Lloyds of London v. Scalera, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 551 at para. 83. 
  All of the allegations in the Ungers' statement of claim are founded in negligence. 
  Paragraph 33 makes allegations against James Riccia as the vehicle operator, 
  and paras. 34 and 35 make allegations against Matthews and his business in their 
  capacity as the owner of the vehicle. For the purposes of this motion, the important 
  allegations are set out in paras. 36-39. These contain allegations against Matthews 
  and his business in their capacity as employer of the driver of the vehicle. 
  As it was unclear whether the driver's employer was Matthews personally or his 
  business Matthews Pallet Recycling, the Ungers made allegations against Matthews 
  personally in paras. 36 and 37 and repeated the same allegations against Matthews 
  Pallet in paras. 38 and 39. I need set out only paras. 36 and 37: </p>
<p class="indent"> 36. Independent of liability of the Defendant, Darcy Matthews, 
  as owner of the Matthews' motor vehicle, the Plaintiffs allege that at the time 
  of the striking and collision herein referred to, James Riccia was an employee 
  of Darcy Matthews, acting within the course of such employment, and Darcy Matthews 
  was vicariously responsible qua the employer of James Riccia, for the acts and 
  omissions of the said James Riccia.</p>
<p class="indent">37. Independent of liability of Darcy Matthews as owner of the 
  Matthews' motor vehicle, the Plaintiffs allege the following independent acts 
  of neglect of Darcy Matthews as the employer of James Riccia, that caused or 
  contributed to the accident which is the subject of this action, the particulars 
  of which include: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) failing to instruct, inform and train the Defendant, James 
  Riccia, as to the safe and proper manner in which the motor vehicle should have 
  been operated;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) failing to provide the Defendant, James Riccia, with a motor 
  vehicle that was in a safe condition and in a good and proper state of repair;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) failing to maintain the said motor vehicle in a good and 
  proper state of repair;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) failing to select a more qualified person other than the 
  Defendant, James Riccia, to operate the motor vehicle;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) failing to request, implement, consider and act on a periodic 
  employee performance appraisals of the Defendant, James Riccia;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) failing to adopt measures to consider, supervise, control 
  and satisfy themselves of James Riccia's capability to be charged with the responsibility 
  of operating a motor vehicle given the manner in which the Defendant, James 
  Riccia, had operated a vehicle on prior occasions.</p>
<p class="indent">(g) charging the Defendant, James Riccia, with responsibilities 
  which were beyond his capabilities;</p>
<p class="indent">(h) allowing the Defendant, James Riccia, to perform responsibilities 
  of which he was not capable.</p>
<p class="indent">(i) failing to find a position for the Defendant, James Riccia, 
  in which his responsibilities would be limited to activities that would not 
  expose others, such as the Plaintiffs, to risks of harm;</p>
<p class="indent">(j) allowing the Defendant, James Riccia, to drive a motor vehicle 
  in a manner in which he exposed others, such as the Plaintiffs, to risks of 
  harm;</p>
<p class="indent">(k) sending the Defendant, James Riccia, on a task without providing 
  him with a driver who, unlike the Defendant, James Riccia, was a safe and responsible 
  driver;</p>
<p class="indent">(l) failing to anticipate, or anticipate and prevent the conduct 
  of the Defendant, James Riccia, referred to above;</p>
<p class="indent">(m) failing to ensure that James Riccia did not operate the 
  Matthews' motor vehicle at night.</p>
<p>
  [5] The relevant parts of Pilot's automobile policy are set out below: </p>
<p class="indent"> 3.3 You or other insured persons may be legally responsible 
  for the bodily injury to, or death of others, or for damage to the property 
  of others as a result of owning, using or operating the automobile. In that 
  case, we will make any payment on your or other insured persons' behalf that 
  the law requires, up to the limits of the policy.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">3.3.1 By accepting this policy you and other insured persons 
  irrevocably appoint us to act on your or their behalf in any lawsuit against 
  you or them in Canada, the United States of America or any other jurisdiction 
  designated in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule arising out of the ownership, 
  use or operation of the automobile.</p>
<p class="indent">If someone sues you or other insured persons by this Section 
  for losses suffered in an automobile incident, we will provide a defence and 
  cover the costs of that defence, including investigation costs. We will pay 
  all legal costs the court assesses against you and other insured persons in 
  the lawsuit we have defended.</p>
<p class="indent">If there is a judgment against you or other insured persons, 
  we will pay any post-judgment interest owed on that part of the amount the court 
  orders that falls within the liability limits of your policy.</p>
<p class="indent">We reserve the right to investigate, negotiate and settle any 
  claim out of court if we choose. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [6] The relevant parts of Co-Operators' CGL policy are set out below: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1.</p>
<p class="indent">a. We will pay the sums that the insured becomes legally obligated 
  to pay as compensatory damages because of bodily injury or property damage to 
  which this insurance applies. No other obligation or liability to pay sums or 
  perform acts or services is covered unless explicitly provided for under SUPPLEMENTARY 
  PAYMENTS - COVERAGES A, B AND D. This insurance applies only to &quot;bodily 
  injury&quot; and &quot;property damage&quot; which occurs during the policy 
  period. The &quot;bodily injury&quot; or &quot;property damage&quot; must be 
  caused by an &quot;occurrence&quot;.<a href="#**">*</a> <a name="r*"></a>The 
  &quot;occurrence&quot; must take place in the coverage territory. We will have 
  the right and duty to defend any action seeking those compensatory damages but: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> 1) The amount we will pay for compensatory damages is limited 
  as described in SECTION III - LIMITS OF INSURANCE;</p>
<p class="indent">2) We may investigate and settle any claim or &quot;action&quot; 
  at our discretion; and </p>
<p class="indent">3) Our right and duty to defend end when we have used up the 
  applicable limit of insurance in the payment of judgments or settlements under 
  Coverages A, B or D or medical expenses under Coverage C.</p>
<p class="indent">2. This insurance does not apply to &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">1) &quot;Bodily injury&quot; or &quot;property damage&quot; 
  arising out of the ownership, use or operation by or on behalf of any insured 
  of: </p>
<p class="indent">a) Any &quot;automobile&quot; &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">2) &quot;Bodily injury&quot; or &quot;property damage&quot; 
  with respect to which any motor vehicle liability policy is in effect or would 
  be in effect but for its termination upon exhaustion of its limit of liability 
  or is required by law to be in effect. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [7] The Ungers claims fall within the scope of Pilot's automobile policy if 
  the accident in question resulted from the ordinary and well known activities 
  to which automobiles are put, and if there was a nexus, although not necessarily 
  a direct nexus, between the injuries suffered by the Ungers and the ownership, 
  use or operation of the vehicle: Amos v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia, 
  [1995] 3 S.C.R. 405 at paras. 17, 18; Lefor (Litigation Guardian of) v. McClure 
  (2000), 49 O.R. (2d) 557 at 562 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [8] The coverage provision in the Co-Operators policy is broad and prima facie 
  includes the allegations made by the Ungers. The coverage is, however, limited 
  by several exclusion clauses. The first of the exclusion clauses (para. 2(1)) 
  relevant to this case mirrors the scope of the coverage provided by the Pilot 
  policy and excludes from the Co-Operators policy damages arising out of the 
  ownership, use or operation of any automobile by or on behalf of Matthews. The 
  second relevant exclusion clause (para. 2(2)) excludes liability under the Co-Operators 
  policy where the damages are covered by the Pilot policy or would be covered 
  but for the limits on that policy.</p>
<p>
  [9] An insurer has a duty to defend where on the facts as pleaded there is a 
  possibility that one or more of the claims made against the insured are covered 
  by the policy. Coverage is determined by reference to both the coverage provision 
  in the policy and any exclusions from that coverage contained in the policy. 
  Where, as in this case, the insurer relies on an exclusion clause to avoid any 
  duty to defend, the onus is on the insurer to demonstrate that all of the claims 
  made against the insured are clearly excluded from coverage by the exclusion 
  clause or clauses relied on by the insurer: Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyds 
  of London v. Scalera, supra, at paras. 73-90; Nichols v. American Home Assurance 
  Co., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 801 at 810-811; Monenco Ltd. v. Commonwealth Insurance 
  Co., [2001] 2 S.C.R. 699 at paras. 28-35; Trafalgar Insurance of Canada v. Imperial 
  Oil Limited, [2001] 57 O.R. (3d) 425 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [10] It cannot be seriously argued that Pilot does not have a duty to defend 
  all of the claims made by the Ungers. There is certainly at least the possibility 
  that all of the claims result from the normal use of an automobile, and that 
  there is a nexus between the Ungers' injuries and the operation or use of the 
  vehicle. The conclusion that Pilot has a duty to defend all of the claims however, 
  does not mean that Co-Operators has no duty to defend any of the claims: Dominion 
  of Canada General Insurance Co. v. Axa Insurance Co. of Canada, [2003] O.J. 
  No. 2757 (Sup. Ct.). If there is a possibility that any of the claims are captured 
  by Co-Operators' coverage, Co-Operators has a duty to defend those claims even 
  if Pilot also has a duty to defend the same claims. The mere possibility that 
  Pilot's policy may cover all claims, while enough to engage Pilot's duty to 
  defend, does not trigger the exclusion from coverage in para. 2(2) of the Co-Operators 
  policy. That exemption is triggered only if the claims are covered by Pilot's 
  policy.</p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  [11] Counsel for Pilot contends that paras. 36-39 of the statement of claim 
  alleged that Matthews (or his business) was negligent in the hiring, training 
  and supervision of Riccia as well as in the entrustment of the vehicle to him. 
  Counsel contends that these allegations establish a basis for Matthews' liability 
  that is distinct from his liability as the owner, user or operator of the vehicle. 
  Counsel relies on Derksen for the proposition that where there are two concurrent 
  causes of action alleged in a statement of claim and one falls within the coverage 
  of a policy, the insurer under that policy has a duty to defend that claim. 
  These submissions accurately identify the principle in Derksen and were accepted 
  by the motion judge. </p>
<p>
  [12] In Derksen, an employee of the defendant while clearing a work site, placed 
  a steel plate on the back of a truck in a manner which, according to the statement 
  of claim, was negligent. The employee then drove the truck off the site. In 
  the course of the journey, the plate fell off the truck and struck a bus killing 
  one person and injuring three others. The defendant had an automobile policy 
  and a commercial general liability policy. The latter policy contained an exclusion 
  clause, like Co-Operator's policy, excluding liability &quot;arising out of 
  the ownership, use or operation of any automobile&quot;. The commercial general 
  liability insurer contended that the single dominant cause of the loss was the 
  driving of the vehicle with an insecure load and that consequently it had no 
  duty to defend. </p>
<p>
  [13] The Supreme Court of Canada accepted the trial judge's finding that on 
  the material before him, the placing of the plate on the back of the vehicle 
  was part of the clean-up and not part of the loading or use of the vehicle. 
  Based on that finding, the court accepted the motion judge's conclusion that 
  the statement of claim pleaded that the accident resulted from two concurrent 
  sources of causation, one being the operation of the vehicle and the other being 
  the work site negligence in the placing of the plate on the back of the vehicle. 
  Having determined that two concurrent causes of the damages were alleged, the 
  court turned to the exclusion clauses in the commercial general liability policy. 
  Major J. said at para. 49: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Whether an exclusion clause applies in a particular case of concurrent causes 
  is a matter of interpretation. This interpretation must be in accordance with 
  the general principles of interpretation of insurance policies. &#133;</p>
<p>
  [14] Major J. analyzed the exclusion clauses and found that neither excluded 
  liability for a concurrent cause which did not relate to the use, or operation 
  of the automobile. He said at para. 55: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he failure to properly clean up the work site was a concurrent cause and 
  a risk that was covered by the CGL policy. It follows that the exclusion clause 
  is in play but only in respect to that portion of the loss that is attributable 
  to the auto-related cause. &#133;</p>
<p>
  [15] The applicability of Derksen depends on whether in this case there can 
  be said to be two concurrent but discrete claims advanced against Matthews, 
  one of which is not covered by his automobile policy. In Derksen, the finding 
  that the placing of the plate on the vehicle was not part of the loading process 
  and, therefore, not related to the use or operation of the motor vehicle was 
  crucial. Given that finding, there was a possibility that the defendant could 
  be found liable even though it engaged in no negligent conduct in the use or 
  operation of the motor vehicle. For example, even if the collision between the 
  bus and the truck was found to be entirely the fault of the driver of the bus, 
  the defendant might still be liable in damages flowing from the negligent placing 
  of the plate on the truck during the clean-up of the work site. That negligence, 
  apart entirely from the operation or use of the vehicle, may well have contributed 
  to the damages suffered by the plaintiffs in the accident. </p>
<p> [16] When a court is required to determine whether a statement of claim alleges 
  concurrent causes of action for the purposes of determining whether an insurer 
  has a duty to defend, the court must accept the facts as pleaded. The court 
  is not, however, required to accept the pleader's characterization of those 
  facts or the descriptive labels used in the statement of claim. It is the substance 
  and not the form of the pleadings which must govern the insurers duty to defend. 
  As Iacobucci J. noted in Monenco, supra, at para. 34, an insurer's duty to defend 
  cannot be put &quot;at the mercy of the third party pleader&quot;.<a href="#1">[1]</a> 
  <a name="r1"></a> </p>
<p>
  [17] In Scalera, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada had to analyze the statement 
  of claim to determine whether, in substance, it alleged more than one cause 
  of action. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that she was the victim of various 
  sexual assaults over an extended period of time. In her pleadings, she alleged 
  intentional torts, negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. The defendant looked 
  to his homeowner's insurance policy for coverage. That policy excluded coverage 
  for &quot;bodily injury caused by any intentional or criminal act&quot;. The 
  insurer argued that despite the references to negligence and breach of fiduciary 
  duty in the statement of claim, all of the allegations were in substance allegations 
  of intentional acts and, therefore, beyond the coverage offered in the homeowner's 
  policy. </p>
<p>
  [18] Iacobucci J. described the required analysis of the pleadings at para. 
  85: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Having construed the pleadings, there may be properly pleaded allegations of 
  both intentional and non-intentional tort. When faced with this situation, a 
  court construing an insurer's duty to defend must decide whether the harm allegedly 
  inflicted by the negligent conduct is derivative of that caused by the intentional 
  conduct. In this context, a claim for negligence will not be derivative if the 
  underlying elements of the negligence and of the intentional tort are sufficiently 
  disparate to render the two claims unrelated. If both the negligence and intentional 
  tort claims arise from the same actions and cause the same harm, the negligence 
  claim is derivative, and it will be subsumed into the intentional tort for the 
  purposes of the exclusion clause [in the insurance policy] analysis. If on the 
  other hand, neither claim is derivative, the claim of negligence will survive 
  and the duty to defend will apply. &#133; A claim should only be treated as 
  &quot;derivative&quot; for the purposes of this analysis, if it is an ostensibly 
  separate claim which nonetheless is clearly inseparable from a claim of intentional 
  tort. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [19] Iacobucci J. examined the statement of claim in some detail. He rejected 
  the argument that some of the claims sounded in negligence, observing at para. 
  128 that all of the allegations involved intentional sexual contact and were 
  not allegations of a negligent failure to foresee a foreseeable risk of physical 
  contact. Iacobucci J. also rejected the assertion that the allegations described 
  as breaches of fiduciary duty gave rise to a discrete cause of action. He noted 
  that on the facts as pleaded, any breach of fiduciary duty involved intentional 
  tortious conduct and was therefore caught by the exclusion in the insurance 
  policy. Iacobucci J. said at para. 132: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The appellant was alleged to have intentionally seduced the plaintiff, and whether 
  or not this can be characterized as a fiduciary duty claim, any injuries resulting 
  therefrom were caused intentionally. The harm caused by any breach of fiduciary 
  duty is identical to that caused by the sexual battery, and the claim is therefore 
  subsumed, for the purposes of the exclusion clause [in the insurance policy] 
  into the intentional battery. [Emphasis added.] </p>
<p>
  [20] Applying the approach described in Scalera, I conclude that in substance 
  all of the allegations of negligence made in the statement of claim allege that 
  the Ungers were injured as a result of the use, operation or ownership of the 
  vehicle driven by Riccia and owned by Matthews or his business. The mere description 
  of some of the acts of negligence as &quot;negligent business practices&quot; 
  does not create a separate and discrete cause of action. Those allegations could 
  assist the Ungers in establishing their claim only to the extent that they helped 
  them demonstrate that the vehicle was being used or operated in a negligent 
  fashion when the accident in which the Ungers were injured occurred. </p>
<p>
  [21] Paragraph 36 (and paragraph 38) alleges that Matthews is vicariously liable 
  for the conduct of the driver of the vehicle, his employer, Mr. Riccia. An allegation 
  of vicarious liability does not allege a separate cause of action. As Finlayson 
  J.A. explained in Tutton v. Pickering (Town) (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 503 at 508: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he theory behind vicarious liability is that the tort of the employee is 
  imputed to the employer and that the employer is therefore liable for the employee's 
  unlawful action; it is not that the employer itself has committed any wrong.</p>
<p>
  [22] The allegation in para. 36 (and 38) depends on a finding that the driver 
  was negligent and asserts that Matthews is responsible in law for that negligence. 
  This claim arises out of the ownership, use or operation of an automobile on 
  or behalf of the insured Matthews and is excluded from Co-Operators coverage 
  by para. 2(1) of the policy.</p>
<p>
  [23] Paras. 37(b) and 37(c) and the parallel allegations in paras. 39(b) and 
  39(c) allege negligent repair and maintenance of the vehicle. These allegations 
  are referable to the use and operation of the vehicle and fall within the exclusion 
  in para. 2(1) in the Co-Operators policy: Strickland v. Miller, [1998] O.J. 
  No. 2762 (Gen. Div.).</p>
<p>
  [24] The remaining allegations in para. 37 allege that Matthews was negligent 
  in the way he hired, trained and supervised his employee Mr. Riccia. They also 
  contend that Matthews was negligent in entrusting the vehicle to Riccia. These 
  allegations are not discrete causes of action in the sense identified in Derksen. 
  Were the Ungers to establish any of these allegations, but fail to establish 
  that the vehicle was used or operated in a negligent manner at the time of the 
  accident, they would not succeed in their claim. While allegations of negligent 
  training supervision and entrustment may well be germane to whether Matthews 
  and/or his employee were negligent in the ownership, use or operation of the 
  motor vehicle, they do not provide a stand alone ground for recovery by the 
  Ungers. </p>
<p>
  [25] Mr. McRae, for Co-Operators, in his helpful submissions, referred to the 
  court to American authorities which have held that allegations of negligent 
  supervision or entrustment of a vehicle are not discrete from allegations of 
  negligent operation of the vehicle for the purposes of determining insurance 
  coverage. Some of those American authorities were relied on by Hutchinson J. 
  in Perkull (Guardian Ad Litem of) v. Gilbert, [1993] B.C.J. No. 1078 (B.C.S.C.). 
  At para. 14, Hutchinson J. adopted the following passage from Southeastern Fire 
  Ins. Co. v. Heard 626 F. Supp. 476 at 480: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The most well reasoned and convincing rationale for exclusion of negligent entrustment 
  is an analysis of the tort itself. Negligent entrustment is composed both of 
  the entruster's negligence in entrusting the instrumentality and the entrustee's 
  negligent use of the instrumentality. Thus, the triggering element is negligent 
  use of the item, for even if the entrustment was negligent, no cause of action 
  could arise without an injury caused by negligent use of the item. Because negligent 
  use is essential, negligent entrustment arises out of the use of a certain instrumentality. 
  Thus the exclusion [in the insurance policy] applies. &#133; </p>
<p>
  [26] American courts have reached the same conclusion with respect to negligent 
  supervision. In Oakley Transport v. Zurich Insurance 648 N.E. (2d) 1099 (1995) 
  (Ill. App. Ct. 5th Div.), the court held at para. 34: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he gravamen of negligent supervision is that one party (the supervisor) acted 
  unreasonably in allowing another party (the supervisee) over whom he or she 
  had a duty to control to commit some wrong against a third party. The supervisee's 
  conduct which ultimately results in injuries cannot be viewed as an intervening 
  act of negligence. Indeed, the negligence of the supervisor, is by definition, 
  derivative of the negligence of the supervisee. </p>
<p>
  [27] I find the American authorities persuasive. They confirm my view that the 
  allegations contained in the Ungers' statement of claim all involve allegations 
  of negligence in the use, operation or ownership of the Matthews' motor vehicle. 
  All of the allegations are covered by the Pilot Automobile Insurance policy. 
  They are excluded from coverage under the Co-Operators policy by the exclusions 
  in paras. 2(1) and 2(2) of that policy. </p>
<p>
  IV</p>
<p>
  [28] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order below and declare that Co-Operators 
  is not obliged to defend Matthews or his business under the terms of its CGL 
  policy. </p>
<p>
  [29] Co-Operators is entitled to its costs against Pilot on the motion and on 
  the appeal. I would make no order as to costs for or against the Ungers. The 
  motion judge fixed costs on the motion at $500. Co-Operators should have the 
  costs of the motion in that amount. It should have its costs of the appeal fixed 
  at $3000.00.</p>

<p><a name="**"></a><a href="#r*">*</a> &#147;Occurrence&#148; is a defined term

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> Iacobucci J.&#146;s caution rings true 
  in this case. Counsel for the Ungers candidly conceded in oral argument that 
  paras. 36 to 39 of the statement of claim were added with a view to drawing 
  Co-Operators into the action so as to avoid significant limitations on the infant 
  Ungers&#146; ability to recover damages under the Pilot automobile policy.</p>
