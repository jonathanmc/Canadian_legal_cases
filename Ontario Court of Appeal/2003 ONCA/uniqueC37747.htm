<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: March 10, 2003</p>
<p>[1] The respondent, Unique Tool and Gauge Inc. (&quot;Unique&quot;), entered 
  into a contract with the appellant, Impact Tool and Mould Inc. (&quot;Impact&quot;), 
  pursuant to which Unique agreed to manufacture four moulds for Impact. Impact 
  failed to pay the contract price for the moulds and Unique brought an action 
  for the unpaid price and for damages for breach of contract.</p>
<p>[2] After a 20 day trial, Thomson J. held that Impact had repudiated the contract 
  by its non-payment and that Unique was entitled to the unpaid price under the 
  Sale of Goods Act and to damages for breach of contract equal in amount to the 
  unpaid price.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant appeals on several grounds. We see no merit in any of them 
  except for the ground relating to the 5 per cent discount in the contract price 
  occasioned by the fact that the order was for a package of four moulds.</p>
<p>[4] Much of the appellant's appeal invites this court to overturn the factual 
  findings of the trial judge. We see no basis for doing this. The trial judge 
  delivered comprehensive and careful reasons. He made clear findings relating 
  to the credibility of the principal witnesses and he carefully analyzed the 
  documentary record, especially the written contract, and the testimony of various 
  witnesses before reaching his conclusions. Specifically, we can see no basis 
  for interfering with his conclusions that payment was due as set out in the 
  contract which said nothing about invoices, that delivery of the moulds was 
  not a pre-condition to payment, that Unique was entitled to withhold the moulds 
  in the face of Impact's non-payment, and that Unique was entitled to insist 
  on C.O.D. payments after Impact had failed twice to make payments required by 
  the contract.</p>
<p>[5] On the 5 per cent discount issue, we are of the view that the trial judge 
  misread the clear words of the contract. In all other respects, the trial judge 
  relied, correctly, on the words of the contract as controlling his resolution 
  of the issues. In our view, it is clear that the contract agreed upon by Impact 
  was for a total price of $468,112.50 which comprised a base price of $492,750 
  &quot;less 5%&quot;. Nothing in the contract linked the discount to payment. 
  We do not see how Impact's breach of the contract can give rise to an obligation 
  to pay more than the stipulated contract price which specifically included a 
  5 per cent discount.</p>
<p>[6] The appeal is allowed on the issue of the 5 per cent discount in the contract 
  price. In all other respects, the appeal is dismissed. Costs of the appeal to 
  the respondent fixed in the amount of $20,000 inclusive of disbursements and 
  GST.</p>
