<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Despite Ms. Lavine's able arguments, we are not persuaded that the trial 
  judge misapprehended the evidence. It is apparent that the trial judge rejected 
  the appellant's evidence that the &quot;kiss and hug&quot; incident occurred 
  on the evening before he was confronted by the mother. This conclusion was supported 
  by the evidence of the mother and the complainant. The complainant testified 
  that the appellant had improperly approached her in the bedroom on that evening. 
  The mother's evidence was that she found the bedroom in disarray on the evening 
  before she confronted the appellant. The &quot;kiss and hug&quot; incident described 
  by the appellant did not take place in the bedroom.</p>
<p>
  [2] We, therefore, do not agree that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence 
  when he said that Mr. Van Beek does not deny that the mother confronted him, 
  but his explanation of the timing is not acceptable. </p>
<p>
  [3] As to the issue of the complainant's motive to lie, the trial judge found 
  that the appellant's contention that the complainant had reason to fabricate 
  this occurrence was not plausible. The trial judge then addressed only one of 
  the defence arguments as to her motive to lie. It was not necessary for the 
  trial judge to specifically refer to every argument raised by the defence. In 
  any event, we consider the argument that the complainant would have felt constrained, 
  because of her initial lie, to continue the lie some 18 months later at trial 
  in order to protect herself from her mother as most improbable. </p>
<p>
  [4] We are not prepared to interfere with the DNA order. Even if the trial judge 
  proceeded under s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code, we are satisfied that an order 
  should issue under s. 487.052. Although the appellant had no criminal record, 
  there were aggravating circumstances relating to the offences. The complainant 
  was 13 years of age and the appellant was in a position of trust. We see no 
  reason to depart from the usual approach that an order should issue. Accordingly, 
  the appeal is dismissed.</p>
