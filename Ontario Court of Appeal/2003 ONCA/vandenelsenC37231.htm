<p>On appeal from acquittals by Justice James M. Donnelly of the Superior Court 
  of Justice sitting with a jury on October 26, 2001.</p>

<p>
  FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The respondent mother surreptiously abducted her children, triplets, from 
  their father, who had lawful custody of the children pursuant to a court order, 
  and took them to Mexico. Eventually the children were found and returned to 
  their father in Ontario. The respondent was charged with three counts of abduction 
  contrary to a custody order (s. 283(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. 
  C-46). She was tried by Donnelly J. with a jury and acquitted.</p>
<p>
  [2] The Crown appeals the acquittals based on errors of law that it submits 
  the trial judge made in leaving the defence of necessity with the jury when 
  there was no &quot;air of reality&quot; to it and in describing the elements 
  and onus of the statutory defence of necessity to the jury. </p>
<p>
  [3] I agree with the Crown's primary submission that there was no air of reality 
  to the defence of necessity and, as a result, it should not have been left to 
  the jury at all. For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, set 
  aside the acquittals and order a new trial.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [4] Essentially, the respondent had lost custody of the children to the father 
  in March, 2000. The custody trial was adjourned for six months, at which time 
  the trial judge intended to deal with whether the respondent would retain any 
  right to access visits with her children. Fearing that the court would cut off 
  her access completely, and that the children would thereby be deprived of any 
  contact with their mother (herself), she cashed in her assets and prepared to 
  abscond with the children on one of her last access visits. She hid the children 
  in her car and drove to the United States and Panama, then returned to Mexico, 
  where they lived for a few months until they were found and returned to Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [5] In his charge to the jury, the trial judge outlined the evidence in a manner 
  that highlighted the situation that the respondent perceived she faced. He described 
  it as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> The background evidence was, Mr. Merkley [the father] is employed 
  with a conservation authority at London. Ms. VandenElsen taught high school 
  in Waterloo. They moved to Stratford in 1990 as a mid-point between work places. 
  Mr. Merkley testified that within two years following the birth of the children 
  [triplets, 2 boys and 1 girl] on January lst, 1993, he became concerned about 
  Ms. VandenElsen's parenting ability. In September 1995, Ms. VandenElsen took 
  a leave of absence from her employment, made baby-sitting arrangements and leaving 
  the children with Mr. Merkley, rented an apartment in London. In December 1995, 
  Mr. Merkley obtained an interim custody order, which remained in effect until 
  Justice Abbey's order in March of 2000.</p>
<p class="indent">During those four years, Ms. VandenElsen's access was varied 
  from time to time by agreement and by court order. Mr. Merkley testified that 
  as the children were getting older, the baby-sitting arrangements were not satisfactory. 
  He arranged to have his neighbour, Jan Searle take the children one day per 
  week.</p>
<p class="indent">In September 1998, when Mr. Merkley and Jan Searle decided to 
  marry, he and the children moved into her house. Ms. Searle was responsible 
  for the children while he was at work.</p>
<p class="indent">Following a four-week trial, Justice Abbey made the order of 
  March 13th, 2000. Ms. VandenElsen exercised her access entitlement under that 
  order to October 14th. About October 1st, Mr. Merkley was alerted to a possible 
  abduction. He arranged that the October 14th access visit would be at Ms. VandenElsen's 
  mothers' farm. Mr. Merkley confronted Ms. VandenElsen. She denied any pending 
  abduction. The children were not returned from that access visit. Mr. Merkley 
  took leave from his employment and devoted his time to the search. In January 
  2001, they were located in Mexico. Following a week of frustrating administrative 
  delay in Mexico, Mr. Merkley flew home with the children. Ms. VandenElsen was 
  taken into custody and returned to Canada.</p>
<p class="indent">Turning to Ms. VandenElsen's evidence. She described a four-year 
  quest for pregnancy with physically intrusive long-term fertility clinic investigations 
  and procedures with drug therapy and side effects, with donor sperm finally 
  leading to a difficult pregnancy requiring hospitalizations culminating with 
  two months in hospital prior to the premature birth by caesarean section. There 
  was concern over the size and health of the children. There was difficulty in 
  their care and management even with help from Neighbourlink and a baby-sitter. 
  She badly wanted a child, she paid an exacting price.</p>
<p class="indent">When she returned to teaching on a half time basis in September, 
  she spent her energy caring for the children and required respite care or additional 
  support in the home from 4:30 until 7:30 p.m. Friends of the family had moved 
  to Salt Spring Island. The VandenElsens visited there with the children in the 
  summer of 1995. Ms. VandenElsen considered a family move to British Columbia. 
  She finally decided that she could not leave the children in order to go west 
  and set up a home in advance for the family. The B.C. plans were abandoned.</p>
<p class="indent">Marriage problems were developing. Ms. VandenElsen attended 
  a series of six counselling sessions. Mr. Merkley went west to visit a friend. 
  Wanting quiet time and space, Ms. VandenElsen rented a small apartment in London 
  and pursued interests in writing and music. She testified that she spent the 
  occasional night there. She was not working and was able to spend time with 
  her children in lieu of teaching. In December, she bought a cottage across Fanshawe 
  Lake from Mr. Merkley's place of employment. That cottage was registered in 
  his name. During this cottage interval, she continued to spend time in Stratford 
  as the children's primary caregiver.</p>
<p class="indent">In December 1995, Mr. Merkley obtained a court order for interim 
  custody of the children and exclusive possession of the house. Ms. VandenElsen 
  claims that she did not oppose the order because Mr. Merkley said in advance 
  that he was abandoning the application. She did not appeal because her status 
  as primary caregiver remained unchanged. About this time Ms. VandenElsen realized 
  that the marriage was at an end. She and Mr. Merkley went through mediation 
  to try and resolve their differences. From that stage, there was a flurry of 
  court applications.</p>
<p class="indent">When the cottage was sold, Ms. VandenElsen lived briefly in 
  Toronto and returned to Stratford in June of 1997. She was concerned about the 
  well being of the children through this court activity to the extent that she 
  considered moving out of their lives and going to Costa Rica. She deliberated 
  at length and decided she could not leave the children.</p>
<p class="indent">The issue of total termination of Ms. VandenElsen's access was 
  first raised about a month prior to the trial before Justice Abbey. Justice 
  Abbey stated in his reasons for judgment, &quot;when this trial resumes in October, 
  I will make a final determination as to access. It will be apparent from what 
  I have said in these reasons that the possibility remains that the access of 
  the defendant may be terminated.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent"> Ms. VandenElsen testified that she was fearful that Mr. Merkley 
  would succeed in his termination application. This was not an unsupported fear. 
  In assessing the weight and significance of Justice Abbey's reference to termination, 
  one needs only to look to its source. This was neither a witness expressing 
  an opinion, nor was it a lawyer assessing the situation. It was a statement 
  by the judge who would make the decision.</p>
<p class="indent"> Ms. VandenElsen's access had been relentlessly reduced and 
  may have been on the verge of termination. Her view on the access issue was, 
  &quot;in six years, I had gone from mother to threatened zero access.&quot; 
  She had been unsuccessful in the custody issue. She had been unsuccessful on 
  the issue of paying child support. The momentum of the court proceeding was 
  against her. Her fear was that the children would be cut off from all contact 
  with their mother and from the benefits that flow from that association. The 
  children's total deprivation of the care, guidance, love, and support of their 
  mother was seen by Ms. VandenElsen as a danger of imminent psychological and 
  emotional harm to the children.</p>
<p class="indent"> From her perspective, the behaviour of the children was spiralling 
  downward with her declining access. She was involved in a high stakes contest. 
  At issue was a precious asset, the formative years and the welfare of her children. 
  Ms. VandenElsen testified that she truly believed the children needed a loving 
  mother, that she genuinely and honestly felt she had to take the children. Her 
  testimony in part was as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"><span class="indent"> Mr. Powell asked the question, &quot;What 
  did you think might be the result if you were denied access to your children 
  in so far as your children were concerned?"<br>
  "Answer: Well I thought my children would be raised without a mother, that they 
  were going to have - I just thought that they were going to come to some imminent 
  harm, not physical harm, but psychological harm, emotional harm. I didn't think 
  it was healthy. With what I knew and what I believed and what I felt, I didn't 
  want my children raised without a mother. You can have caregivers, but that's 
  not the same as a mother.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="indent"> And further Mr. Powell asked the question: </p>
<p class="indent"> <span class="indent">&quot;Okay."<br>
  "Answer: And with that I was concerned about what could happen in October before 
  Justice Abbey again and I felt that if we were to attend in October and he gave 
  his judgment then at that time I didn't have any recourse, that there were no 
  options for me to pursue any longer of how I could maintain an active role in 
  my children's lives and I wanted to prepare - prepare for that and I wanted 
  to leave. I wanted to leave with my children.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="indent"> And then Mr. VanDrunen [counsel for the Crown] asking these 
  questions in cross-examination: </p>
<p class="indent"> <span class="indent">&quot;Question: Well, you were selfish 
  and wanted the kids for yourself, not for their father and yourself?</span></p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: I wouldn't consider a mother's love for her children 
  and the steps and the actions she takes in terms of that love as being selfish. 
  I wouldn't consider that selfish at all.</p>
<p class="indent"> Question: Well you took the kids away from their stable lives. 
  You took them away from - you took them away from their father, the one person 
  who had been there forever for them?</p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: I took my children from a very nasty situation. They 
  were being raised by the courts and I don't believe any judge can do a better 
  job in raising children than their own parents. So my taking the children was 
  not done to spite anyone. It was not done for selfish motives. It was done because 
  I truly believed these children need a loving and good mother.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent"> Support for that belief by Ms. VandenElsen is found in the 
  Tonia VandenElsen [the respondent's mother] evidence that there was a causal 
  link between the threatened isolation from the children and Ms. VandenElsen 
  taking them from the country.</p>
<p class="indent"> In making assessments of Ms. VandenElsen's actions and motivations, 
  bear in mind, we view these issues in calm reflection with hindsight in the 
  sterile atmosphere of the courtroom. Ms. VandenElsen acted in developing circumstances 
  and in a swirl of powerful emotions. Tonia VandenElsen's evidence indicates 
  the emotional force generated.</p>
<p class="indent"> Firstly, Tonia was so worried, so mixed up, so guilt ridden 
  by her knowledge of the plan to leave with the children that she broke her daughter's 
  solemn confidence.</p>
<p class="indent"> Secondly, her daughter's response to that breach of confidence 
  was in violent anger to the extent of threatening harm and even death to her 
  mother.</p>
<p class="indent"> Ms. VandenElsen's friend, neighbour, and fellow multiple birth 
  mother, Ann Kelly testified about the emotional turbulence: </p>
<p class="indent"> <span class="indent">&quot;Question: Did she ever say anything 
  to you to the effect that the question of her access to the children being denied 
  was something being considered by the court?</span></p>
<p class="indent"> Answer: I - I honestly don't remember that specific. I just 
  remember that even just the Saturday afternoons was just so limited and it's 
  like she'd go through a grieving process every time the kids would go back home. 
  It's like she'd just cry and you know she'd come and cry on my shoulder and 
  go on, 'I can't take this.' It's like she'd go through a bereavement every time 
  the kids would go back home on Saturdays so I knew it was bad at that point 
  but I honestly don't remember that it was going to be denied all together.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent"> You may determine Ms. VandenElsen's motivation by direct evidence, 
  that is by what she tells you. You may determine that motivation by circumstantial 
  evidence. You will remember that I explained that is an examination of the surrounding 
  circumstances, finding out what you accept as proven facts, and drawing rational 
  inferences from those proven facts. Or, you can determine her motivation by 
  both direct and circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p class="indent"> The circumstantial evidence is by fleeing with the children, 
  her entire life and support structures were in convulsion. She sacrificed home, 
  parents, brothers, sisters, friends, and the security of her teaching position 
  with whatever income, health and pension benefits that may have carried. There 
  was a finality about her actions, cashing her Retirement Savings Plan, cashing 
  her children's educational plans, withdrawing her savings, fleeing unaccompanied 
  by an adult into foreign countries, a fugitive with three small children. There 
  is Peter's [one of the children] poignant description of the stealth and subterfuge, 
  their quest for distance, losing the car, being turned back at Panama, the lack 
  of a job, and the need to conserve money. What powerful motivation produced 
  that result?</p>
<p class="indent"> Turning to alternative courses of action which may have been 
  available. There is evidence that during the four years of Mr. Merkley's custody 
  and while these matters were before the court, the children required investigation, 
  assessment, and intervention from the Children's Aid Society, The Huron Perth 
  Clinic, C.P.R.I. in London, that used to be the Children's Psychiatric Research 
  Institute and we are told it has a different name now, Dr. Yaroshevski and Dr. 
  Doering from Waterloo or Kitchener.</p>
<p class="indent"> With all those investigations and court appearances including 
  a four-week trial, the matter remained unresolved after four years. That delay 
  and inconclusive result may have contributed to a perception by Ms. VandenElsen 
  that further resort to lawyers and courts was not the answer. There was no basis 
  on the evidence to conclude that any plea to Mr. Merkley that he relent in his 
  quest for zero access would succeed.</p>
<p>ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [6] The issue on appeal is the availability of the defence of necessity under 
  s. 285 of the Criminal Code. The Crown submits that the trial judge made three 
  errors in leaving the defence of necessity to the jury in this case: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) The defence of necessity should not have been left to the 
  jury at all, as there was no air of reality to the defence and therefore no 
  basis upon which the jury could find necessity.</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) The trial judge erred in instructing the jury that the 
  onus of disproving the defence was on the Crown.</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) The trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury 
  regarding the elements of the defence and in particular to view the first element 
  as subjective only.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>

<p>
  (i) No Air of Reality to the Necessity Defence</p>
<p>(a) Air of Reality</p>
<p>
  [7] In R. v. Cinous, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, the Supreme Court of Canada reiterated 
  and restated the &quot;air of reality test&quot; that applies before a defence 
  may be left with the jury, and described the correct evidential standard to 
  be applied in determining whether there is an air of reality to a defence. The 
  rule is that no defence is to be left with a jury unless the defence has &quot;an 
  air of reality.&quot; The test for whether there is an air of reality to a defence 
  is &quot;whether there is evidence on the record upon which a properly instructed 
  jury acting reasonably could acquit&quot; (para. 49).</p>
<p>
  [8] In Cinous, the accused and two criminal cohorts were together in a car when 
  he shot one cohort in the back of the head, essentially as a pre-emptive strike, 
  because he feared that the cohort intended to kill him. He testified that calling 
  the police was not an option in his criminal society. At trial he raised the 
  issue of self-defence. The jury did not accept the defence and convicted the 
  accused. The accused appealed based on alleged errors made by the trial judge 
  in his charge to the jury on self-defence. The Crown argued that there was no 
  legal significance to any such errors, because the defence of self-defence should 
  not have been left to the jury at all, as it had no air of reality. The Supreme 
  Court agreed.</p>
<p>
  [9] The court first stated the basic features of the air of reality test as 
  derived from the case law: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) An evidential foundation is required before a defence can 
  be put to a jury. A trial judge is obliged to leave with the jury all defences 
  that arise on the facts, whether raised or not, and to keep from the jury defences 
  that lack an evidential foundation, even if the defence in question is the only 
  basis for an acquittal.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) The air of reality test imposes an evidential (rather than 
  a persuasive) burden on the accused.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) The totality of the evidence is to be considered.</p>
<p class="indent">(d) The test does not address the substantive merits of the 
  defence or its likelihood of success, but only whether a real issue exists.</p>
<p class="indent">(e) The air of reality issue is a question of law. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p class="indent">(f) The same test and evidential standard apply to all defences. 
  (paras. 50 - 57).</p>
<p>
  [10] The Supreme Court then discussed the evidential standard. The court rejected 
  the &quot;some evidence/no evidence&quot; dichotomy, adopting instead the articulation 
  set out by Cory J. in R. v. Osolin, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595 at 682: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The term &quot;air of reality&quot; simply means that the trial judge must determine 
  if the evidence put forward is such that, if believed, a reasonable jury properly 
  charged could have acquitted.</p>
<p>In other words, even if there is &quot;some evidence,&quot; in order to leave 
  a defence to the jury that evidence must be &quot;reasonably capable of supporting 
  the inferences necessary for the defence to succeed&quot; (para. 63). Looked 
  at the other way, the duty of the trial judge is to keep the defence from the 
  jury &quot;[w]here evidence does not permit a reasonable inference raising a 
  reasonable doubt on the basis of the defence&quot; (para. 86). </p>
<p>
  [11] In applying the evidential standard, the trial judge cannot consider credibility, 
  but must accept the defence evidence as believed. Furthermore, the trial judge 
  is not to weigh evidence, make findings of fact or draw determinate factual 
  inferences. However, using the process of &quot;limited weighing&quot; described 
  in R. v. Arcuri, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 828, the trial judge must reach a conclusion 
  about &quot;the field of factual inferences that could reasonably be drawn from 
  the evidence&quot; (para. 91). Stated another way, &quot;the question is whether, 
  if the jury were to accept the construction of the evidence most favourable 
  to the accused's position, the requisite inferences could reasonably be drawn&quot; 
  (para.98).</p>
<p>
  (b) The Necessity Defence</p>
<p>
  [12] The necessity defence against the charge of abduction in contravention 
  of a custody order (s. 283 of the Criminal Code) is statutory. Sections 283(1) 
  and 285 of the Criminal Code provide: </p>
<p class="indent"> s. 283. (1) Every one who, being the parent, guardian or person 
  having the lawful care or charge of a person under the age of fourteen years, 
  takes, entices away, conceals, detains, receives or harbours that person, whether 
  or not there is a custody order in relation to that person made by a court anywhere 
  in Canada, with intent to deprive a parent or guardian, or any other person 
  who has the lawful care or charge of that person, of the possession of that 
  person, is guilty of </p>
<p class="indent">(a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for 
  a term not exceeding ten years; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.</p>
<p class="indent">s. 285. No one shall be found guilty of an offence under sections 
  280 to 283 if the court is satisfied that the taking, enticing away, concealing, 
  detaining, receiving or harbouring of any young person was necessary to protect 
  the young person from danger of imminent harm or if the person charged with 
  the offence was escaping from danger of imminent harm.</p>
<p>
  The cases relating to the common law defence of necessity are instructive and 
  applicable to the interpretation of s. 285. See e.g. R. v. Adams (1993), 12 
  O.R. (3d) 248 (C.A.) at 258. </p>
<p>
  [13] In R. v. Perka, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232, the Supreme Court confirmed that necessity 
  is a common law defence preserved by s. 8(3) of the Criminal Code. The defence 
  is in the nature of an excuse, rather than a justification for otherwise illegal 
  conduct. As such, it must be strictly controlled and limited to situations where 
  the illegal conduct is based on human instincts of self-preservation or altruism 
  that overpower voluntary action, i.e. where the wrongful conduct was the only 
  effective choice open to the accused.</p>
<p>
  [14] In Perka, the court set out three requirements for the defence of necessity: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) The situation must be urgent and the peril imminent.</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Compliance with the law must be demonstrably impossible 
  such that there is no reasonable legal alternative to disobeying the law.</p>
<p class="indent">(c) The harm inflicted must be proportional to and not greater 
  than the harm sought to be avoided.</p>
<p>
  [15] In 2001 in R. v. Latimer, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3, the Supreme Court was required 
  to apply the three part test of necessity to the situation faced by Robert Latimer 
  when he took the life of his severely disabled daughter. The Supreme Court upheld 
  the decision of the trial judge that there was no air of reality to the defence 
  of necessity and therefore no basis upon which to leave the defence to the jury. 
  The court held that the first two requirements of the test, imminent peril or 
  danger and absence of a reasonable legal alternative, must be assessed on a 
  &quot;modified objective standard,&quot; while the third requirement, proportionality, 
  is to be determined using an objective standard. The modified objective standard 
  incorporates the accused's situation and characteristics into an objective evaluation.</p>
<p>
  [16] In Latimer, the court concluded, first, that there was no imminent peril 
  because the accused's daughter's ongoing pain and her impending surgery did 
  not constitute an emergency, as better pain management was available and there 
  was no imminent threat to her life. Second, there were legal alternatives available 
  for the care of the accused's daughter, including a feeding tube for pain management, 
  and placing her in a group home setting for ongoing care. Third, the court observed 
  that, assuming it was possible for a homicide to be considered proportional 
  in the context of the necessity defence, in the circumstances of that case there 
  was no risk of harm seriously comparable to death.</p>
<p>[17] The issue under s. 285 of the Criminal Code in this case was whether taking 
  the children from their father, in contravention of a custody order, was necessary 
  to protect them from the danger of imminent harm. </p>
<p>
  [18] Before leaving the necessity defence with the jury, the trial judge was 
  required to determine whether there was an air of reality to the defence by 
  considering whether there was some evidence upon which the jury could reasonably 
  draw the required inferences for the defence of necessity to succeed: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) that from the respondent's point of view, but using the 
  modified objective standard, there was a danger of imminent harm to the children;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) that from the respondent's perception, but using the modified 
  objective standard, there were no reasonable legal alternatives to taking the 
  children in breach of the custody order; and </p>
<p class="indent">(iii) that viewed objectively, the harm to the children by taking 
  them in contravention of the custody order was proportional to the potential 
  harm to the children that was being avoided.</p>
<p>
  (i) The Perceived Harm</p>
<p>
  [19] The respondent mother feared that at the resumption of the custody hearing 
  in October, the trial judge would deprive her of all access to her children. 
  She believed that if that happened, the children would suffer psychological 
  and emotional harm being raised by caregivers and without a mother. The imminence 
  of the harm was the court date, after which she felt she would have no ability 
  to carry out her plan to remove the children. In effect, the imminence of the 
  harm to the children was not the perceived psychological and emotional harm 
  that would result from being deprived of a loving mother, the effect of which 
  would accrue over time, but the fact that after the court order, the respondent 
  anticipated that she might no longer have the opportunity to exercise self-help 
  to remove the children.</p>
<p>
  [20] The issue is whether the respondent's fears, accepting that they were honestly 
  held, and viewing the matter from her perspective taking into account her condition 
  and situation, can amount in law to &quot;imminent harm&quot; within the meaning 
  of s. 285 and the requirements of the necessity defence. In my view it is clear 
  that they cannot. There is neither harm, nor imminence in this situation.</p>
<p>
  [21] The defence provided by s. 285, according, as it does, a lawful excuse 
  for breaching a court custody order, is designed to deal with an emergent situation 
  of danger, arising in circumstances that were not foreseen or contemplated by 
  the court that granted the custody order. In this case, the opposite is true. 
  Here, the danger or harm contemplated by the respondent mother is the very condition 
  that would be created by the court if it were to grant custody of the children 
  to the father with no access to the mother. Such an unusual order would only 
  be made if the court were completely satisfied that it was in the best interests 
  of the children, including their psychological and emotional interests.</p>
<p>
  [22] For the criminal court to hold that a situation deliberately created in 
  the children's best interests by the custody court after a trial could be considered 
  a situation of imminent harm to the children, would invite a regime of anarchy 
  and chaos within the family law domain. Parents unhappy with the outcome of 
  custody proceedings would feel entitled to ignore, with apparent impunity, unfavourable 
  court orders regarding their children. Instead, what the parents must do is 
  operate within the legal system. The first route is an appeal. Another is to 
  revisit the custody and access issues from time to time as circumstances change 
  for the various affected parties.</p>
<p>
  [23] Not only was the harm contemplated by the respondent not the type of harm 
  for which the defence can be invoked, but there was also no emergent situation 
  which required immediate action by the respondent. A deadline was looming when 
  the access decision would be made in the family court proceedings. However, 
  that deadline did not create an emergency situation requiring immediate action 
  to rescue the children from imminent danger. The imminence analysis is inextricably 
  linked with the second requirement for a necessity defence, alternative legal 
  avenues.</p>
<p>
  (ii) Other Legal Avenues</p>
<p>
  [24] The respondent had been given a window of time in which to demonstrate 
  that her access to the children should be continued. One of her legal avenues 
  was to build the record for access during that period based on her own actions, 
  and possibly to obtain further expert assistance. Another was to retain experienced 
  counsel to assist her with the court proceedings, instead of continuing to represent 
  herself and deprive herself of the benefit of professional representation in 
  such a crucial matter. As noted above, she also always had the right to appeal 
  any order, and if unsuccessful, to reopen the issue at a later date. In other 
  words, the respondent had unfettered access to the courts for the purpose of 
  seeking to resolve her concerns in a legal fashion. Furthermore, she had been 
  given time to do so in the family law proceeding.</p>
<p>
  (iii) Proportionality</p>
<p>
  [25] Given that there was no danger of harm here within the meaning of the necessity 
  defence, it is conceptually difficult to address the proportionality issue meaningfully. 
  However, taking children from their home and their normal life, to a life in 
  hiding and on the run from authorities with no community support, is clearly 
  a drastic remedy, which can only be proportional to a drastic imminent danger 
  from which the children must be rescued. Viewed objectively, this was not such 
  a situation.</p>
<p>
  [26] Clearly, both the trial judge and the jury had considerable empathy for 
  the respondent, a mother faced with the possibility of losing all access to 
  her children, who honestly and truly believed that it was in their best interests 
  for her to become a fugitive with them, rather than leave them with no access 
  to their mother. The fact that the children, who were seven and a half years 
  old, willingly went with her and co-operated in hiding from authorities without 
  trying to contact the father, suggests that they loved and trusted their mother 
  very much. The children's co-operative conduct could be seen as affirming the 
  mother's perception of the situation, and in that way, as a troubling factor 
  for the jury.</p>
<p>
  [27] Having said that, the necessity defence is not meant for situations where 
  the parties are unhappy with custody and access decisions of the court. Often 
  the losing party may continue to feel that the court's custody or access decision 
  was not the best for the children. However, in our society, where the parents 
  choose or are forced by circumstances to separate, and where they cannot agree 
  on the best care arrangements for their children, the court process is not only 
  the best and most orderly way to determine where the children should be, it 
  is the only legal procedure for doing so. It is based on the children's best 
  interests. The court's orders must be respected and followed. Any other approach 
  would lead to anarchy.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [28] As I have concluded that the trial judge erred in law by leaving the defence 
  of necessity to the jury where there was no air of reality to any of the requirements 
  for a necessity defence, it is unnecessary to address the other two issues, 
  which relate to how to apply the defence. </p>
<p>
  [29] I would allow the appeal, set aside the acquittals and order a new trial.</p>
