<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Charron J.A. resolved many issues in her endorsement. The only issue we 
  need address is the appellant's request for an order waiving "all 
  court administrative fees". The appellant requested this order on the 
  grounds that she was unable to pay the fees stipulated by the Rules of Civil 
  Procedure to process her appeal and that she had been refused legal aid. The 
  fees payable on the filing of a notice of appeal and for perfecting an appeal 
  are $225 and $175, respectively.</p>
<p> [2] As no authority was provided that this court had jurisdiction to waive 
  the administrative fees, Charron J.A. rejected the appellant's request. 
  However, she went on to make the following factual finding:</p>
<p class="indent"> I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that the requirement 
  to pay the usual fees will frustrate the appellant's right to prosecute 
  her appeal. I am also not persuaded, given the apparent proliferation of litigation 
  between the parties, that this would be an appropriate case to grant such relief.</p>
<p> [3] Subsequent to the argument of the appellant's motion, a panel of 
  the Divisional Court held in the context of proceedings in the Small Claims 
  Court that the absence of a statutory mechanism for the waiver or reduction 
  of fees in limited circumstances was a breach of the rule of law and was unconstitutional: 
  Polewsky v. Home Hardware Stores Ltd., [2003] O. J. No. 2908. The court held 
  that as at common law there is a constitutional right of access to the courts, 
  indigent persons should not be denied access to the Small Claims Court when 
  their claims or defences are meritorious and their inability to pay the prescribed 
  fees is proven on a balance of probabilities. However, on the facts of the case, 
  the court found that Mr. Polewsky had failed to demonstrate that, but for the 
  reduction or waiver of fees, he would not be able to access the court.</p>
<p> [4] Assuming, without deciding, that the principles discussed in Polewsky 
  apply to proceedings in the Court of Appeal, we are of the opinion that had 
  the Polewsky decision been available to Charron J.A. she would have come to 
  the same decision on the basis of her findings of fact.</p>
<p> [5] As no grounds have been shown for interfering with the order of Charron 
  J.A., we would dismiss the motion to review her order without costs.</p>
