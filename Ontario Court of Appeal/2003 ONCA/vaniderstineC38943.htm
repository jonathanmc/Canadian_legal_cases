<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Following a trial by judge and jury, the appellant was found guilty of 
  sexual assault and assault arising out of the same sequence of events on August 
  25, 2001, and not guilty of assault relating to an incident the previous day 
  on August 24, 2001. He appeals his conviction only as the sentence appeal is 
  moot. </p>
<p>
  [2] The four grounds of appeal all relate to the trial judge's charge to the 
  jury. The appellant alleges the trial judge erred in his charge with respect 
  to reasonable doubt, the definition of assault, failed to adequately relate 
  the theory of the defence to the jury and failed to give a limiting instruction 
  with respect to the complainant's prior consistent statement.</p>
<p>
  [3] We did not call upon the Crown to respond to the alleged errors in the charge 
  with respect to reasonable doubt and the definition of assault. In our opinion, 
  the charge substantially complied with R. v. Lifchus (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 
  1, and the jury would not have been under any misapprehension as to the burden 
  of proof. The definition of assault adequately stated the law. These two grounds 
  of appeal are dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [4] With respect to the other two grounds of appeal, we would observe that the 
  trial judge's charge must be looked at in context. This was a short trial and 
  there was a single issue. The appellant did not testify. </p>
<p>
  [5] Although the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to put the main 
  points of the defence to the jury, the trial judge did tell the jury the defence 
  relied on inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony, her lack of memory 
  with respect to some of the details of the date in question, the absence of 
  ripped clothing, possible motive for fabrication and that the only evidence 
  relating to how the complainant suffered her injuries was evidence given by 
  her. Although the defence complained that the trial judge did not put to the 
  jury that the complainant's memory may have been affected by a combination of 
  alcohol consumption and the prescription medication she was on, the trial judge 
  correctly noted that there was no evidence that the combination of alcohol the 
  complainant admitted consuming combined with the prescription medication could 
  have affected her memory. The trial judge's charge adequately put the position 
  of the defence to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [6] With respect to the failure to provide a limiting instruction to the jury 
  in connection with the complainant's prior consistent statement, it is important 
  to note that defence counsel himself relied on the contents of the statement 
  and what it did not contain as a central part of his defence. As this court 
  said in R. v. Demetrius, [2003] O.J. No. 2728 (O.C.A.) it will not always be 
  necessary to provide such an instruction where the defence relies on the statement. 
  Moreover, the Crown made it clear in its submissions to the jury that it was 
  not relying on the prior consistent statement as proof of the underlying facts. 
  Accordingly we would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant's appeal as to conviction is dismissed.</p>
