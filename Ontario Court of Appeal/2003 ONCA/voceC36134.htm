<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Although the appellant raises several issues on appeal, the only substantive 
  issue is the costs ordered by the trial judge. In our view, leave should be 
  granted to appeal costs. </p>
<p>
  [2] The trial judge's costs order consisted of two components: the costs ordered 
  by O'Connor J. and the costs of the proceedings before her. As to the former, 
  we think she erred in principle in upholding O'Connor J.'s costs order. That 
  order was implicitly set aside on February 6, 2001, when O'Connor J. set aside 
  his original November 1, 2000 endorsement. Moreover, each party should bear 
  its own costs of the proceedings before O'Connor J. as each was wrong on the 
  jurisdiction question that regrettably infected this entire proceeding. </p>
<p>
  [3] As to the costs of the proceedings before Wein J., we see two problems with 
  her order. First, having rejected solicitor and client costs, the amount she 
  ordered, $12,000, was substantially in excess of party and party costs. Second, 
  her costs order in part reflected her view that the respondent succeeded on 
  the jurisdiction question and, again, we are of the view that each party should 
  bear its own costs on that question. </p>
<p>
  [4] That said, we think there is merit in the trial judge's view that some effect 
  be given to Mr. Schmidt's reasonable proposal in his letter of September 27, 
  2000. Custody was the main issue at trial, and in that letter, the respondent 
  proposed a continuation of the existing custody arrangement with the hope that 
  related issues could be worked out. Instead of trying to work out these issues 
  the appellant chose to litigate, continuing to assert her claim for sole custody, 
  which she resiled from only at trial. </p>
<p>
  [5] An important objective of a costs award in any proceeding, including family 
  law proceedings, is to encourage parties to resolve their differences by reasonable 
  settlement proposals. The respondent did so in this case; the appellant did 
  not. Viewed in this light, we think the respondent is entitled to some costs 
  of the proceedings before Wein J. A fair figure is $4,000, inclusive of disbursements 
  and G.S.T.</p>
<p>
  [6] The other grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant are either moot or 
  without merit.</p>
<p>
  [7] Accordingly, leave to appeal costs is granted and the judgment of Wein J. 
  is varied by striking out paragraph 11 and substituting the figure $4,000 in 
  paragraph 13. The appeal is otherwise dismissed. Because success was divided 
  there shall be no costs of the appeal.</p>
