<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Gerald F. Day of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated May 18, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Counsel for the appellants attacked virtually all of the findings of liability 
  made against the appellants by the trial judge. We have not been persuaded, 
  however, that the trial judge made any reversible error and accordingly the 
  appeal must be dismissed. We briefly set out our reasons for that conclusion.</p><P>
  The Guarantee Fees on the Willow Pointe Project</p><P>
  [2] The Willow Pointe Agreement provided a mechanism for additional funding 
  if it was necessary. Rather than acting in accordance with the agreement, Mr. 
  Litowitz and Mr. Goldenberg withheld a 3% guarantee fee from the estate's partnership 
  share in Willow Pointe on behalf of the Warsh estate share. The trial judge 
  noted a number of concerns with the appellants' entitlement to this fee. First, 
  contrary to what was implied in the letter to Mrs. Warsh, the appellants did 
  not put up their guarantees in October 25, 1993. Second, the estate was prepared 
  to try to make arrangements to provide its share of the additional financing 
  in accordance with the agreement. Third, the guarantee fee was not a service 
  for which the appellants were entitled to compensation under the agreement. 
  </p><P>
  [3] We would not interfere with the trial judge's conclusion that the appellants 
  were not entitled to this fee on a quantum meruit basis. Mr. Litowitz was in 
  a fiduciary relationship with Mrs. Warsh. He withheld these guarantee fees and 
  yet did not make full and complete disclosure to Mrs. Warsh or to the administrator 
  pendente lite for the estate. Further, Mr. Litowitz borrowed a substantial sum 
  from the Willow Pointe Partnership without disclosing this fact to the Warsh 
  estate or to the fourth partner and borrowed that amount at a rate substantially 
  below any commercial borrowing rate. This money was still owing at the time 
  that the appellants continued to withhold the 3% fee. The trial judge described 
  the conduct of Mr. Litowitz and Mr. Goldenberg in this respect as &quot;disgraceful&quot;. 
  It was open to the trial judge on those facts to refuse the appellants' claim 
  for quantum meruit.</p><P>
  MPW</p><P>
  [4] In late 1996, the estate trustee gave notice that the estate would no longer 
  pay the monthly MPW charges after the expiration of the current lease in September 
  1996. Accountants retained by the estate later determined that beginning in 
  March 1997, Mr. Litowitz and Mr. Goldenberg had appropriated to MPW 15% of the 
  estate's share of payments made by third parties to partnership entities of 
  the three original partners, Warsh, Litowitz and Goldenberg. The appellants 
  submit that the trial judge erred in law in giving judgment against the appellants 
  for this amount and that MPW was the proper party. </p><P>
  [5] We do not accept this submission. Although the stated reason for withholding 
  15% of the estate's share was to cover management services provided by MPW, 
  it was open to the trial judge to find that the appellants had appropriated 
  these monies by intercepting and transferring them to MPW and that accordingly, 
  they were required to return the funds to the estate. The judgment was therefore 
  properly entered against them. </p><P>
  [6] It is implicit in the trial judge's findings that he was not satisfied that 
  MPW or the appellants provided services that would justify the 15%. He found 
  that the estate and Croydon &quot;gave ample notice to MPW that it would not 
  be continuing to share the overhead&quot; and that the renewal of the lease 
  would be at MPW's &quot;own peril without any further claim against the Warsh 
  estate or Croydon&quot;. The appellants were not entitled to resort to a self-help 
  remedy in the absence of an agreement amongst all of the partners.</p><P>
  [7] In view of this conclusion, it follows that the estate is also entitled 
  to the fees appropriated by the appellants following the trial judgment that 
  were the subject of the order of Sharpe J.A. on July 17, 2002.</p><P>
  Legal Fees</p><P>
  [8] The appellant Litowitz submits that the trial judge erred in requiring him 
  to return $7,729.73 of the $25,000 retainer paid by Mrs. Warsh. Counsel argues 
  that only Mrs. Warsh could make this claim and she was not a plaintiff. However, 
  the trial judge found as a fact that Mrs. Warsh retained Mr. Litowitz on behalf 
  of the estate. There was ample evidence to support this finding. The pleadings 
  were amended to include this part of the claim. We would therefore not give 
  effect to this submission.</p><P>
  Willow Pointe Management Fees</p><P>
  [9] The appellants withheld a substantial portion of the Warsh estate's share 
  of the proceeds from the Willow Pointe partnership. The partnership agreement 
  provides that &quot;Unless specifically authorized no Partner shall receive 
  any salary or compensation for services rendered to the Partnership except as 
  set forth in this Agreement.&quot; It is common ground that the agreement does 
  not provide for any management fees to the appellants. They relied at trial 
  upon a notation in the minutes of a partnership meeting held a few weeks after 
  Mr. Warsh's death as specific authorization. The trial judge found as a fact 
  that Mrs. Warsh, although in attendance at that meeting along with her accountant, 
  did not agree to the appellants being paid any management fee. That finding 
  is supported by the evidence and is fatal to this aspect of the appellants' 
  submission.</p><P>
  [10] The appellants also rely upon s. 20 of the Partnerships Act, R.S.O. 1990 
  c. P.5 which provides as follows:</p>
<P class="indent"> The mutual rights and duties of partners, whether ascertained 
  by agreement or defined by this Act, may be varied by the consent of all the 
  partners, and such consent may be either expressed or inferred from a course 
  of dealings.</p>
<P>
  [11] However, as pointed out in R.C. Banks, Lindley &amp; Banks on Partnership, 
  Seventeenth Edition (London, 1995) at &sect;10-10, &quot;It goes without saying 
  that no variation will be effective if the consent of all the partners is not 
  forthcoming.&quot; The trial judge's findings of fact demonstrate that the Warsh 
  estate did not consent.</p>
<P> [12] Finally, we would not give effect to the appellants' submissions that 
  apart from the agreement they should be entitled to a management fee on a quantum 
  meruit or unjust enrichment basis. The appellants argue that with the death 
  of Mr. Warsh they had to assume his share of the management responsibilities 
  and were entitled to be compensated accordingly. This is a very difficult argument 
  for the appellants given the findings by the trial judge about breach of trust 
  by Mr. Litowitz. In any event, the agreement itself called for payment of management 
  fees to an onsite manager. The appellants have failed to make out a claim that 
  they should be paid additional management fees. The trial judge's error in referring 
  to one of the clauses of the Leslea-Colorado agreement is of no consequence. 
  His conclusion and his findings of fact do not in any material way turn on that 
  clause.</p>
<P>
  Leslea Colorado Management Fees</p>
<P> [13] Appellants' counsel made no submissions concerning the trial judge's 
  findings that the estate was entitled to the 1994 and 1995 management fees for 
  Leslea-Colorado and we see no basis for interfering with the trial judge's conclusion.</p>
<P>
  CONCLUSION</p><P>
  [14] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs. The money standing in 
  court under the Order of Sharpe J.A. should be paid out to the respondents. 
  </p><P>
  [15] The respondents will have 7 days to submit a bill of costs of the appeal 
  and to provide written submissions concerning the scale of costs. The appellants 
  will have 7 days to respond to those submissions and to the bill of costs. Those 
  submissions are to be filed with the Senior Legal Officer of the Court.</p>
