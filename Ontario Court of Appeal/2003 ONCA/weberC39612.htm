<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Roy E. Bogusky of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice on February 5, 2003.</p>
<p>FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The Crown seeks leave and if leave is granted, appeals from the conditional 
  sentence of fourteen months plus three years' probation imposed by the trial 
  judge on three charges of distribution of child pornography and one charge of 
  possession of child pornography. The Crown seeks a custodial sentence.</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent pled guilty to the charges. Following his plea, a two and 
  one half day sentence hearing was held. At the hearing, the Crown called the 
  officers involved in the investigation and entered into evidence a book of photos 
  of the material that was the subject of the charges as well as nine video clips 
  from the respondent's computer. The defence presented two psychiatric reports. 
  One report was from Mr. Conforto, the respondent's psychotherapist; the other 
  was from Dr. Butler, an expert in sexual deviations, who testified at the hearing. 
  These experts agreed that the respondent is not a pedophile. The Crown presented 
  no psychiatric evidence.</p>
<p>
  [3] The sentencing judge gave reasons for the sentence he imposed. In his reasons, 
  he referred to the respondent's collection of photographs as &quot;disgusting&quot;. 
  Reiterating this reaction in his subsequent discussion with counsel regarding 
  the disposition of the appellant's computer, the judge remarked that when he 
  went home during the hearing, he had to shower immediately because of his reaction 
  to seeing the photographs.</p>
<p>
  [4] In his reasons for sentencing, the trial judge noted that both counsel had 
  agreed that a term of detention was required in order to satisfy the sentencing 
  principles of specific and general deterrence, and that the term should be something 
  less than two years. He then considered whether the sentence should be served 
  in the community, and in that context, whether the respondent posed a danger 
  to the community. The trial judge identified children as the relevant community 
  potentially in danger, then accepted the only available psychiatric opinion 
  evidence that indicated the respondent is not a pedophile. He expressed some 
  skepticism about this conclusion in the face of the respondent's possession 
  of &quot;such a large quantity of disgusting pictures,&quot; but deferred to 
  the expert opinion evidence presented to him. He concluded as well that the 
  respondent was therefore not a threat to the children in the community.</p>
<p>
  [5] The trial judge then referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
  R. v. Cohen (2001), 144 O.A.C. 340, where this court, setting aside a sentence 
  of fourteen months in custody for similar charges, substituted a conditional 
  sentence of fourteen months to be served in the community on strict house arrest 
  conditions, plus three years' probation. The trial judge noted that the circumstances 
  in Cohen were almost identical to those in this case, except that the respondent 
  had shown contrition by pleading guilty, while Mr. Cohen had not.</p>
<p>
  [6] The trial judge then imposed the same sentence on the respondent as this 
  court had imposed on Mr. Cohen including a three-year period of probation following 
  a fourteen-month conditional sentence on strict terms of house arrest.</p>
<p>
  GROUNDS OF APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [7] The Crown submits that the trial judge made three errors which entitle this 
  court to set aside the sentence and impose a sentence of incarceration: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) The trial judge misapprehended the circumstances of the 
  offences and failed to consider aggravating factors. <br>
</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The trial judge fundamentally failed to grasp the nature 
  of the offences. </p>
<p class="indent">(3) The trial judge failed to give adequate consideration to 
  the sentencing principles of general deterrence and denunciation.</p>
<p>
  (1) Misapprehension of the circumstances of the offences</p>
<p>
  [8] In his reasons for sentence the trial judge begins by stating that the respondent 
  pled guilty to possessing child pornography and distributing four pictures on 
  three occasions over the Internet. This statement is accurate. The Crown objects 
  that this bare statement fails to reflect the fact that the pictures were not 
  just sent to three people, but to the people who had asked to be listed within 
  a chat room to receive pornographic material. Including the police officers 
  who asked to be listed, on the first occasion there were 16 recipients, on the 
  second 61 and on the third 94 recipients. On the third occasion, it was the 
  respondent who initiated the list making program, and therefore the distribution 
  of the child pornography.</p>
<p>
  [9] The Crown also suggests that the trial judge misapprehended the circumstances 
  in this case by equating them to those in the Cohen case and by distinguishing 
  the case of Lisk, [1998] O.J. No. 1456 (C.A.). In Lisk, this court held that 
  it would not be appropriate to impose a conditional sentence where the offender 
  distributed material in exchange for more child pornography. The Crown argues 
  that the respondent's behaviour in the chat rooms, including identifying himself 
  using a profile of a thirteen-year-old swimsuit model looking for an older female, 
  suggests he was looking to contact pedophiles. The Crown also points to one 
  of the images found on the respondent's computer of a young girl with a caption: 
  &quot;Hi. You want to trade? My age only or you will get no reply.&quot; The 
  Crown submits that the existence of this image stored in the respondent's computer 
  is strong evidence that he sought to exchange child pornography.</p>
<p>
  (2) Failure to grasp the nature of the offences</p>
<p>
  [10] The Crown submits that, by identifying children as the members of society 
  harmed by the respondent's conduct, the trial judge focused only on the children 
  in the pictures and failed to appreciate the numerous ways in which possession 
  of child pornography fuels the market for the illegal material and therefore 
  the creation of more material.</p>
<p>
  (3) Failure to give adequate consideration to the factors of general deterrence 
  and denunciation</p>
<p>[11] The Crown submits that the trial judge focused on the respondent's circumstances 
  more than on how the sentence would address the factors of general deterrence 
  and denunciation. He erred by equating the circumstances of this case with those 
  in Cohen. Further, he accepted the psychiatric opinion evidence that the respondent 
  is not a pedophile without addressing its weaknesses, such as the fact that 
  the psychiatrist did not conduct phallometric testing on the respondent. </p>
<p>
  [12] The Crown submits that the aggravating circumstances in this case consist 
  of the nature of the photos, their indiscriminate distribution over the Internet, 
  the accessibility of the respondent's stored material to his family (although 
  there was no suggestion that any of them ever saw it), and the inference from 
  his Internet activity that he was seeking to exchange child pornography with 
  other pedophiles.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [13] Although the trial judge's reasons were succinct, he dealt with the issues 
  that were pertinent to his determination of the appropriate sentence. Crown 
  counsel fairly points out in her factum that this court has imposed and approved 
  a broad range of sentences for the offences of possession and distribution of 
  child pornography. These include periods of reformatory incarceration and conditional 
  sentences. The trial judge was made aware of some or all of these cases. He 
  was well aware of the circumstances of the offences as well as of the offender. 
  He was clearly concerned about the conclusion reached by the psychiatric opinion 
  evidence, but was entitled to accept it, especially when there was no contradictory 
  opinion evidence presented. In any case, the respondent did obtain counselling 
  and continues to do so.</p>
<p>
  [14] Finally, the trial judge did not err in comparing the circumstances of 
  this case to those in Cohen, and in concluding that the circumstances were so 
  alike that a similar sentence would be appropriate and would achieve the necessary 
  sentencing objectives.</p>
<p>
  [15] In Cohen, the accused distributed a total of eleven different photographs, 
  which graphically portrayed the sexual abuse of children, on four occasions 
  to different undercover officers. Although he did this in response to requests 
  from the officers and did not initiate any of the transmissions, the accused 
  did not know the identity of the officers or what they would do with the material 
  including whether they would retransmit it to others or use it for grooming 
  children. The accused in Cohen frequented Internet chat rooms used to discuss 
  and exchange child pornography, and entered into private chats discussing activities 
  he had or wished to engage in with young women. He was found in possession of 
  a computer disc containing stories advocating sex with children as well as a 
  graphic image file, all of which were admitted to be child pornography. As in 
  this case, the evidence showed that Mr. Cohen was also not a pedophile. As with 
  the respondent, the charges had had a very serious impact on the accused, his 
  work as well as on his family.</p>
<p>
  [16] The major difference, as noted by the trial judge was that in Cohen, the 
  accused did not demonstrate any remorse; he did not plead guilty and he appealed 
  his conviction as well as his sentence.</p>
<p>
  [17] Both these men engaged in despicable activity. Because they operated through 
  the Internet, the scope for the dissemination of the pornographic material was 
  unbounded once it was sent out to one person. As Crown counsel pointed out in 
  her submissions, albeit for a different purpose, one of the pictures in this 
  case seems to be the same as one picture described in the case of R. v. Fox, 
  [2002] O.J. No. 3548 (O.C.J.), aff'd, Nov. 4, 2002, unreported endorsement per 
  Weiler, Charron, and Moldaver JJ.A., which suggests that these materials are 
  in full circulation through the Internet.</p>
<p>
  [18] In our view, the trial judge made no error in equating the situations of 
  these two men. In the present case, the respondent and his family have probably 
  suffered even more than in Cohen. The fresh evidence, admitted without objection, 
  is that the respondent, because of the publicity, lost not only his original 
  employment, but also the job he obtained following the charges. Further, his 
  family is estranged from him and he is suicidal.</p>
<p>
  [19] As this court stated in Cohen, the offences of possession and dissemination 
  of child pornography are very serious and require a sentence which clearly denunciates 
  the conduct and deters others. As the court also stated in that case, a conditional 
  sentence with strict house arrest conditions can adequately serve the objectives 
  of general deterrence and denunciation and is appropriate for certain offenders. 
  </p>
<p>
  [20] Substantial deference is owed to trial judges on matters of sentencing 
  because they are the individuals most familiar with, not only the facts of the 
  case and the evidential record, but also the accused and the accused's family, 
  and the needs of their own communities. </p>
<p>
  [21] We see no error in the decision of the trial judge to give the respondent 
  the same sentence given to Mr. Cohen by this court, in circumstances that were 
  substantially similar including the need for denunciation and general deterrence.</p>
<p>
  RESULT</p>
<p>
  [22] Leave to appeal the sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
