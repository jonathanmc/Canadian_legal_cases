<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Duty counsel for the appellant advanced two submissions on the conviction 
  appeal:</p>
<p class="indent">(i) the trial judge gave an inadequate instruction on in-dock 
  identification; and </p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the trial judge gave an inadequate W.D. instruction.</p>
<p>[2] On the first submission, in the context of how this case went to the jury, 
  the instruction on in-dock identification was sufficient. The appellant was 
  known to two of the witnesses and acknowledged that he was at the scene. The 
  only live issue at trial was whether he had a role in the beating. However, 
  all witnesses said that two persons administered the beating: Lelbanc, and another, 
  who could only have been the appellant. Moreover, one of the witnesses who knew 
  the appellant heard him utter inculpatory words. Another witness who heard those 
  same words said they were spoken by the same person who beat the victim, that 
  is the appellant. We therefore decline to give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>[3] On the second submission the trial judge gave an impeccable W.D. instruction 
  concerning Mr. Wellington&#146;s evidence. The appellant contends however that 
  in giving that instruction the trial judge did not include the evidence of Leblanc, 
  who also testified for the defence. We acknowledge that it would have been preferable 
  had the trial judge done so, but we think the overall instruction was adequate. 
  The trial judge did expressly tell the jury that Leblanc&#146;s evidence could 
  give rise to a reasonable doubt. We therefore do not give effect to this ground 
  of appeal. Accordingly, the conviction appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>[4] On the sentence appeal, in our view the sentence was entirely fit given 
  the seriousness of the crime and the appellant&#146;s record. Although leave 
  to appeal sentence is granted the appeal is dismissed. </p>
