<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Paul Lamek of the Superior Court of
  Justice dated October 16, 2000.</p> 
<p>FELDMAN J.A.</p> 
<p> [1] The appellant, Whitby Landmark Development Inc., is the owner of a condominium
  project constructed by Mollenhauer Construction Limited. Performance of the
  project was bonded by the respondent, Zurich Indemnity Company of Canada, as
  surety. Mollenhauer became insolvent at a point when it had substantially completed
  the project, but owed Landmark monies under the construction contract in respect
  of cost savings it had achieved and that it had contracted to share with Landmark.
  The trial judge held that although the bond would cover a claim by Landmark
  for cost savings under the construction contract, Landmark's claim under the
  bond failed because, upon Mollenhauer's default, Landmark did not immediately
  declare the contractor in default and call on the bond. The trial judge further
  found that because of Landmark's failure, Zurich suffered prejudice because
  it was deprived of a reasonable opportunity to protect its position before
  Mollenhauer's financial demise. </p> 
<p> [2] Landmark appeals the finding that its failure to declare Mollenhauer
  in default was fatal to its claim on the bond. Zurich cross-appeals the trial
  judge's finding that the bond would provide coverage for cost savings. For
  the reasons that follow, I would affirm the decision of the trial judge. I
  conclude that while the bond would provide coverage for the contracted cost
  savings, in the circumstances, Zurich was not required to respond to Landmark's
  claim.</p> 
<p> FACTS</p> 
<p> [3] On September 7, 1990, Landmark entered into a contract with Mollenhauer
  to construct a twelve-story multi-unit condominium building on its land in
  Whitby, Ontario. The contract required Mollenhauer to provide Landmark with
  a performance bond, which it obtained from Zurich. </p> 
<p> [4] The bond is dated September 17, 1990. It is a one-page document in a
  standard form commonly used in the construction industry, identified as CCDC
  221-1979 ("CCDC-2"). Under the bond, Mollenhauer is named as "Principal",
  Landmark as "Obligee", and Zurich as "Surety". The bond
  is in the amount of $8,831,102.50, known as the "penal amount" and
  provides: </p> 
<p class="indent"> WHEREAS, the Principal has entered into a written contract
  with the Obligee, dated the 7th day of SEPTEMBER 1990, for 12 STOREY RESIDENTIAL
  WITH 2 LEVELS OF UNDERGROUND PARKING, WHITBY, ONTARIO in accordance with the
  Contract Documents submitted therefore which are by reference made part hereof
  and are hereinafter referred as the Contract.</p> 
<p class="indent">NOW, THEREFORE, THE CONDITION OF THIS OBLIGATION is such that
  if the Principal shall promptly and faithfully perform the contract then this
  obligation shall be null and void; otherwise it shall remain in full force
  and effect.</p> 
<p class="indent">Whenever the Principal shall be, and declared by the Obligee
  to be, in default under the Contract, the Obligee having performed the Obligee's
  obligations thereunder, the surety may promptly remedy the default, or shall
  promptly</p> 
<p class="indent">(1) complete the Contract in accordance with its terms and
  conditions or</p> 
<p class="indent">(2) obtain a bid or bids for submission to the Obligee for
  completing the Contract in accordance with its terms and conditions, and upon
  determination by the Obligee and the Surety of the lowest responsible bidder,
  arrange for a contract between such bidder and the Obligee and make available
  as work progresses (even though there should be a default, or a succession
  of defaults, under the contract or contracts of completion, arranged under
  this paragraph) sufficient funds to pay the cost of completion less the balance
  of the Contract price; but not exceeding, including other costs and damages
  for which the Surety may be liable hereunder, the amount set forth in the first
  paragraph hereof. The term "balance of the Contract price", as used
  in this paragraph, shall mean the total amount payable by the Obligee to the
  Principal under the Contract, less the amount properly paid by the Obligee
  to the Principal.</p> 
<p> [5] The construction contract between Landmark and Mollenhauer provided for
  a guaranteed maximum price for the project of $17,640,969. It also included
  a provision whereby the owner and contractor would share any cost savings on
  the project in the following proportion: 75 per cent to the owner and 25 per
  cent to the contractor, but the contract contained no method for payment of
  the cost savings to the owner. Because of the timing of the project, it transpired
  that subtrades were tendering low bids to obtain work, resulting in substantial
  cost savings. In order to implement a method for sharing the cost savings,
  Landmark and Mollenhauer agreed on a Monthly Deduction System whereby Landmark's
  share of each month's estimated savings would be deducted from its monthly
  progress payments to Mollenhauer.</p> 
<p> [6] The work was substantially completed by February 1, 1992, and a Certificate
  of Substantial Completion was published. Because no liens were registered against
  the project in the forty-five days following the publication of the Certificate,
  the holdback monies in the amount of $1,812,923 could be released by Landmark.
  Before that date, representatives of Landmark and Mollenhauer met to negotiate
  a reduction in the amount to be released to Mollenhauer in order to protect
  Landmark for the balance of its share of the overall cost savings, the exact
  amount of which was yet to be determined. However, Mollenhauer insisted on
  release of the full holdback and Landmark complied. In fact, Landmark made
  an overpayment of over $35,000. </p> 
<p> [7] Appendix A to the construction contract dealt with the contract price,
  together with the mechanism for payment of that price to Mollenhauer, and the
  cost sharing agreement between Landmark and Mollenhauer. Clause 6 of Appendix
  A obliged Mollenhauer to provide Landmark with "a certificate setting
  out the total Cost of the Work in sufficient detail to permit a general evaluation
  [of that cost] &#133; as soon as possible but no later than 150 days after
  the date of substantial completion." Pursuant to clause 7, Landmark then
  had the right to audit the supporting accounting records, with final payment
  under the contract to reflect the cost adjustments generated by the audit.</p> 
<p> [8] Despite the terms of the construction contract outlined above, Mollenhauer
  never delivered (and Landmark never requested) a Certificate of the Total Cost
  of the Work, although according to the contract, Mollenhauer was required to
  provide that Certificate by June 30, 1992. On or about February 3, 1993, Mollenhauer
  ceased carrying on business and never finally completed the work under the
  contract. </p> 
<p> [9] Landmark completed the work itself, then made its claim under the bond
  on May 6, 1993, demanding payment by Zurich of the balance of its share of
  the cost savings under the contract, ultimately fixed at $601,972.</p> 
<p> [10] The trial judge was required to address four issues in order to determine
  whether Landmark was entitled to recover its claim from Zurich under the bond: </p> 
<p class="indent"> (1) whether the bond is answerable for a claim for Mollenhauer's
  monetary obligation to Landmark, as opposed to Mollenhauer's construction obligation;</p> 
<p class="indent">(2) whether the bond was vitiated by a material change to the
  construction contract, i.e. the introduction of the Monthly Deduction System;</p> 
<p class="indent">(3) whether Landmark's failure to declare Mollenhauer in default
  under the contract relieved Zurich from responding to a claim under the bond;</p> 
<p class="indent">(4) whether Zurich suffered any prejudice as a result of Landmark's
  failure to declare Mollenhauer in default for failure to deliver a Certificate
  of Total Cost and to provide the surety with timely notice of the default.</p> 
<p> [11] The trial judge found: </p> 
<p class="indent"> (1) the bond was answerable for the claim; </p> 
<p class="indent">(2) the bond was not vitiated by the introduction of the Monthly
  Deduction System, which was beneficial to the surety; </p> 
<p class="indent">(3) Landmark's failure to declare Mollenhauer in default for
  failure to deliver the Certificate of the Total Cost of the Work was a failure
  of a condition precedent to payment by the surety under the bond; and</p> 
<p class="indent">(4) Zurich was prejudiced by Landmark's failure to declare
  a default and to provide it with timely notice of the default. </p> 
<p>As a result, Landmark's claim under the bond was dismissed.</p> 
<p> ISSUES ON THE APPEAL</p> 
<p> [12] Landmark appealed the finding of the trial judge that it committed any
  default under the construction contract, or in the alternative, that its default
  caused any prejudice to Zurich. Zurich cross-appealed on the issue of the interpretation
  of the bond and whether the bond would respond to the type of monetary claim
  asserted by Landmark.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> Landmark objected
  to the cross-appeal on procedural grounds on the basis that one cannot appeal
  or cross-appeal from reasons. However, in order for Landmark to successfully
  appeal the judgment of the trial judge, the issue of the interpretation of
  the bond necessarily arises.</p> 
<p> ANALYSIS</p> 
<p> [13] I propose to deal with the issues in the same order as the trial judge
  did, as it is the most logical way to conduct the analysis. Consequently, the
  first issue is the one raised by Zurich on the cross-appeal.</p> 
<p> (1) Properly interpreted, does the bond respond to the monetary claim for
  cost savings under the construction contract?</p> 
<p> [14] Zurich's position is that the bond is only intended to cover the costs
  of completing the physical construction work under the contract, including
  the cost of correcting defective work, but does not extend to collateral obligations
  of the contractor such as its obligation to share the cost savings it achieved.</p> 
<p> [15] Zurich relies on the evidence given at trial as to the usual practice
  for making underwriting decisions on performance bonds for construction projects.
  The underwriter will ask a set of standard questions, including the dollar
  value of the project, the extent of the work to be performed by subcontractors,
  the start and end dates for the project and the reputation of the contractor.
  Where the construction contract is in the standard CCDC-2 form, as in this
  case, the usual practice in the industry is that the underwriter will not read
  the construction contract when making its underwriting decision. Furthermore,
  the calculation of the premium on performance bonds is based on a mathematical
  equation that does not generally take into account the terms of the construction
  contract. The penal amount of the bond in this case was calculated as fifty
  per cent of the guaranteed maximum price of construction. There was no discussion
  between Mollenhauer and Zurich when the bonding arrangements were made as to
  whether the bond would respond to claims for cost savings under the construction
  contract. Zurich submits that this evidence shows that the parties did not
  intend the bond to cover a monetary claim for cost savings.</p> 
<p> [16] It is trite that in interpreting a bond, the intention of the parties
  as to the obligations of the surety is found in the language of the bond: Thomas
  Fuller Construction Co. (1958) v. Continental Insurance Co., [1973] 3 O.R.
  202 (H.C.J.) at 216. Where the bond incorporates by reference the construction
  contract, the terms of the construction contract also form part of the bond.
  To the extent that the bond in any way qualifies its coverage, the terms of
  the bond govern: Kenneth W. Scott &amp; R. Bruce Reynolds, Scott and Reynolds
  on Surety Bonds (Toronto: Carswell, 1993) at 7-1, 2-34. If there is ambiguity
  in the bond, the form having been chosen by the bonding company, the contra
  proferentem rule of interpretation applies: Thomas Fuller v. Continental, supra,
  at 218.</p> 
<p> [17] In this case, the bond provides that the construction contract documents
  are made part of the bond. Furthermore, all benchmarks for action and obligation
  under the bond are referenced to the construction contract: The bond is void
  if the principal promptly and faithfully performs the contract; otherwise,
  the bond remains in full force and effect. It is when the obligee declares
  the principal in default under the contract, having performed its own obligations
  under the contract, that the surety is obliged to choose among the following
  three options under the bond: (1) the surety may promptly remedy the default;
  if the surety chooses not to do that, then it shall (2) complete the contract
  in accordance with its terms; or (3) obtain a bid or bids for completing the
  contract in accordance with its terms and make available sufficient funds to
  pay the cost of completion less the balance of the contract price up to the
  penal limit of the bond. There is no language in the bond that limits in any
  way the references to the construction contract or the obligations to complete
  that contract or to act on a default under that contract. </p> 
<p> [18] In support of its position that the bond will not respond to a claim
  for funds representing cost savings owed by the contractor to the owner, Zurich
  points to the surety's second and third options, which are to complete the
  contractor's obligations under the contract. However, the first option available
  to the surety is to remedy the principal's default. There is no qualification
  on the type of default referred to. Furthermore, the surety's third option
  does not limit the surety's obligations to funding the completion of the physical
  construction; instead, the bond makes the surety's obligations inclusive of "other
  costs and damages for which the Surety may be liable hereunder".</p> 
<p> [19] Zurich relies on a line of American authority for the proposition that
  the intent of the construction performance bond must be gleaned from its purpose,
  which is to ensure completion of construction, and that the obligation under
  the bond must be interpreted as so limited. The trial judge did not find these
  authorities of assistance and concluded: "I am driven back to the language
  of this bond and it is from that source that I must discern the intention of
  the parties." In my view, the trial judge made no error in that conclusion.</p> 
<p> [20] The American cases relied on by Zurich are from Florida and Pennsylvania.
  The leading Florida case is American Home Assurance Co. v. Larkin General Hospital,
  593 So. 2d 195 (Fla. 1992), where the issue was whether a surety under a performance
  bond could be held liable for delay damages. The court held that it could not
  unless the bond specifically provided such coverage (p. 196). The language
  of the bond in question was substantially the same as in this case. The court
  in Larkin concluded that the bond's language "merely guaranteed the completion
  of the construction contract and nothing more" (p. 198). The court focused
  on the language in the third option that the surety is required to provide "sufficient
  funds to pay the cost of completion less the balance of the contract price" (p.
  197). The court also rejected the argument from a decision in another case
  that the words "including other costs and damages for which the Surety
  may be liable" have the effect of extending the obligation of the surety
  to cover damages caused by delay (p. 197).</p> 
<p> [21] The leading authority from Pennsylvania is the case of Downingtown Area
  School District v. International Fidelity Insurance Co., 769 A.2d 560 (Pa.
  Commw. Ct. 2001). The construction contract in that case contained a liquidated
  damages clause for damages to the owner caused by delays in construction. When
  a delay occurred, the owner put the surety on notice and asked it to address
  the delay. The court interpreted the language of the third option under the
  bond as limiting the surety's liability to the cost of completion incurred
  by paying the substitute contractor and nothing more. The court noted that
  its interpretation conformed to statutory language of the state Public Works
  Contractors' Bond Law of 1967, 8 PA. CONS. STAT. &sect;&sect; 191-203, which
  required a performance bond for one hundred per cent of the contract amount,
  but did not refer to any consequential or delay damages.</p> 
<p> [22] I agree with the trial judge's conclusion that this case law is of little
  assistance in interpreting the scope of the application of the bond in the
  case at bar, where the claim is not for damages for delay, but for compensation
  for default in payment of the cost savings owed to the owner under the contract.
  As I discuss below, the "cost of completion" language in the bond
  necessarily includes the cost savings owed by the contractor to the owner (as
  part of the calculation of the balance of the contract price) so that the analyses
  of the Florida and Pennsylvania courts are not applicable to coverage for shared
  cost savings owed by the contractor. In addition, the Pennsylvania statute,
  for which there is no equivalent in Ontario, also influenced that court's interpretation
  of the bond in Downingtown. </p> 
<p> [23] Moreover, there is American authority from other state courts that has
  interpreted the bond language to extend beyond the cost of completion to include
  delay damages: Amerson v. Christman, 261 Cal. App. 2d 811, 825 (1968); Cates
  Construction Inc. v. Talbot Partners, 53 Cal. App. 4th 1420, 1462 (1997), rev'd
  on other grounds, 21 Cal. 4th 28 (1999); and liquidated damages: Pacific Employers
  Insurance Co. v. City of Berkeley, 158 Cal. App. 3d 145 (1984); Riva Ridge
  Apartments v. Robert G. Fisher Co., 745 P.2d 1034 (Colo. Ct. App. 1987). In
  a fact situation somewhat similar to this case in R.J. Griffin &amp; Co. v.
  Continental Insurance Co., 497 S.E. 2d 586 (Ga. Ct. App. 1998), the Court of
  Appeals of Georgia held the surety liable to reimburse the contractor for funds
  that had been overpaid to the subcontractor and that the subcontractor wrongfully
  refused to return. The language of the bond required the surety "to perform
  fully and complete the work". The court held that the words "perform
  fully" obligated the surety to answer for the subcontractor's default
  in payment (p. 587).</p> 
<p> [24] In interpreting the intent of the parties as to the coverage of the
  bond and whether it extends beyond funding the cost of completing the physical
  work to the cost sharing provisions of the construction contract,<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> the
  operation of the surety's third option is, in my view, particularly instructive.</p> 
<p> [25] Under the surety's third option, where bids are obtained for a new contractor
  to complete the work, the surety must "make available&#133; sufficient
  funds to pay the cost of completion less the balance of the Contract price".
  The phrase "balance of the Contract price" is defined to mean "the
  total amount payable by the Obligee to the Principal under the Contract, less
  the amount properly paid by the Obligee to the Principal." Therefore,
  where there is a cost-sharing arrangement in the contract, the balance of the
  contract price is reduced by the amount that may be owing by the contractor
  to the owner at the time of default as a result of cost savings; consequently,
  the amount that the surety is required to pay to complete the physical work
  is greater than it would have been had there been no cost sharing provision
  in the original contract. As a result, the surety effectively pays for the
  owner's share of the cost savings.</p> 
<p> [26] Following this analysis, the owner will only be able to recover its
  share of the cost savings if it has "properly paid" the contractor.
  If the owner has made payments not called for by the contract, or before they
  were due, and the contractor defaults, there may be an issue to what extent
  the surety will have to respond. A further issue is how the bond will operate
  if there is no further construction work left to be done at the time of default.
  I need not address either of these potential issues in this case because of
  my disposition of issue number two below.</p> 
<p> [27] In summary, subject to the operation of the bond in any particular circumstances,
  I conclude that there is no basis in the language of the bond or in the circumstances
  surrounding its negotiation or completion to suggest that the cost-sharing
  provisions of the construction contract are not included as bonded losses. </p> 
<p> (2) Was Landmark in breach of its obligations under the bond by failing to
  declare Mollenhauer in default and notify Zurich of the default?</p> 
<p> [28] Landmark submits that it had no ability under the construction contract
  to declare Mollenhauer in default. The argument is based on article 5.2 of
  the contract which provides: </p> 
<p class="indent"> If the Contractor should neglect to prosecute the Work properly
  or otherwise fails to comply with the requirements of the Contract to a substantial
  degree and if the Consultant has given a written statement to the Owner and
  Contractor that sufficient cause exists, the Owner may notify the Contractor
  in writing that he is in default of his contractual obligations and instruct
  him to correct the default in the five (5) working days immediately following
  the receipt of such notice.</p> 
<p> [29] Landmark argues first that because work under the contract was ongoing,
  Mollenhauer's failure to provide the Certificate of the Total Cost of the Work
  within 150 days following substantial completion was not a failure to comply
  with the requirements of the contract to a substantial degree, entitling the
  consultant to issue a written statement of sufficient cause. The consultant
  did not issue the statement, which is a condition precedent to an owner's declaration
  of default under the contract. Furthermore, there is no provision in the contract
  that allows the owner to compel or request the Certificate.</p> 
<p> [30] In my view there is no merit to this submission. There is no suggestion
  that it was because of any failure on the part of the consultant under the
  construction contract that Landmark did not declare Mollenhauer in default.
  In fact, the trial judge found that it was Landmark that "allowed matters
  to drift" (para. 22).</p> 
<p> [31] Landmark also argues that it acted reasonably in not declaring a default
  under the bond on the basis that its perception at the time was that the default
  by Mollenhauer in not providing the Certificate was not a serious one. Landmark
  refers to Thomas Fuller, supra, at 218, where Houlden J. stated that it is
  up to the obligee under the bond to determine when a default by the principal
  is so serious that notice of default under the contract must be given to the
  surety.</p> 
<p> [32] Again, this argument does not bear scrutiny. In Thomas Fuller, the issue
  was whether the owner's failure to declare the contractor in default for smaller
  defaults that had occurred earlier was a breach of the owner's obligations
  under the bond. It was in that context that the court held, at 217, that: </p> 
<p class="indent"> [T]he bond negatives any obligation on the part of the obligee
  to notify the defendant of defaults by Singer unless the default was of so
  serious a nature that the obligee deemed it proper to make a declaration of
  default and to call upon the bonding company to perform its obligations under
  the bond. At this stage, the plaintiff was required to give notice of default
  to the bonding company, but not otherwise. </p> 
<p> In this case, the owner failed to make a timely declaration of the very default
  on which it relies in calling on the bond: failure of the contractor to pay
  the owner's share of the cost savings, the amount of which is determined by
  the Certificate of Total Cost, after audit. This is not a case of the obligee
  failing to acknowledge and alert the surety to other earlier minor defaults
  upon which the owner does not rely.</p> 
<p> [33] Finally, Landmark submits that, as a compensated surety, Zurich must
  demonstrate that it was prejudiced by Landmark's failure to declare Mollenhauer
  in default and to give timely notice of the default: Citadel General Assurance
  Co. v. Johns-Manville Canada Inc. (1983), 147 D.L.R. (3d) 593 (S.C.C.). According
  to Landmark, because Zurich is the bonding company for Mollenhauer on many
  projects, it was well aware of Mollenhauer's financial circumstances and problems
  and therefore was not prejudiced by any lack of notice by Landmark.</p> 
<p> [34] The trial judge concluded that Zurich did suffer prejudice by Landmark's
  failure to provide notice of default: </p> 
<p class="indent"> One cannot know what would have been the consequence of a
  declaration of default and notice to Zurich. It may be that Mollenhauer would
  have produced the certificate of total cost promptly thereafter, perhaps while
  it was still in a financial condition to pay the outstanding savings to Landmark.
  Certainly, at that point, Landmark and Zurich could have been in no worse position
  to arrange performance of Mollenhauer's obligations than they were after Mollenhauer
  had gone out of business.</p> 
<p class="indent">The provisions of the bond calling for a declaration of default
  are included for a rational and easily discernible purpose. Zurich is entitled
  to know when it may be called on under the bond and it must be given every
  reasonable opportunity to protect not only the obligee but also itself against
  the consequences of the principal's default. In my view, Landmark, by failing
  to take timely steps to declare Mollenhauer in default and to give notice to
  Zurich, failed in its duty to Zurich and cannot now hold Zurich responsible
  for the loss that it claims (paras. 25 and 26).</p> 
<p> [35] Landmark argues that because Zurich knew about Mollenhauer's financial
  problems earlier, and did nothing, there was nothing Zurich could have done
  in this case with earlier notice from Landmark, and, therefore, it suffered
  no prejudice. I also reject this argument. First, the trial judge made a finding
  of fact on the issue. Without palpable and overriding error, that finding is
  unassailable on appeal. Clearly one cannot know what would have happened in
  circumstances that did not occur. The trial judge's conclusion that Zurich
  would have at least had the opportunity to call on Mollenhauer to pay Landmark
  while it still had funds is reasonable. Mollenhauer had the holdback funds
  for some period of time. It also carried on for several months thereafter,
  and may therefore have been in a position before its insolvency to make good
  on some, if not all, of its obligation to Landmark. There were also other steps
  open to Zurich such as taking further security from Mollenhauer. Although these
  steps would have been less viable with the passage of time, and therefore may
  not have been available even with timely notice of default, the trial judge's
  conclusion that Zurich was not given a timely opportunity to take advantage
  of whatever leverage may have been available to it with Mollenhauer cannot
  be said to be an error.</p> 
<p> RESULT</p> 
<p> [36] I would therefore dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal. Although
  Landmark obtained no relief on the appeal, there were two major issues raised
  on which success was effectively divided. In my view, these are circumstances
  where it is appropriate that each side bear its own costs.</p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> In its notice of cross-appeal Zurich
  also raised the issue of whether the Monthly Deduction System constituted a
  material change to the construction contract that had the effect of discharging
  Zurich of its obligations under the bond. However, that issue was not pursued
  in the factum or in oral argument. </p> 
<p><a name="2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a> The nature of the provision in issue,
  a cost-sharing agreement related to the cost of construction and the contract
  price, is relevant to the analysis of the parties' intentions. Had the construction
  contract contained an unusual provision, for example, that obliged the contractor
  to make a payment to the owner wholly unrelated to the cost of construction,
  other considerations regarding the intent of the parties under the bond may
  become relevant.</p>
