<p>On appeal from conviction by Justice John Hamilton of the Superior Court of 
  Justice, and a jury, on December 7, 1998, and from sentence imposed on December 
  10, 1998.</p>
<p>
  FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from his convictions on four counts of bank robbery 
  and one count of wearing a disguise on two grounds: (1) the appellant's inculpatory 
  statements to the police should have been excluded as being involuntary, and 
  (2) the trial judge's charge to the jury on identification evidence was inadequate 
  and in error. The appellant submits that if the statements were improperly admitted, 
  the verdicts are unreasonable. The Crown concedes the second ground, which affects 
  the verdicts on counts 1, 4 and 5, there being no identification of the appellant 
  on counts 2 and 3.</p>
<p>
  [2] I would give effect to both grounds of appeal and set aside the convictions 
  on all counts. In my view, without the statements, the verdicts on counts 1, 
  2, 3 and 5 are unreasonable. I would therefore order a new trial only on count 
  4.</p>
<p>
  I. The Statements</p>
<p> (a) Facts</p>
<p>[3] The appellant was charged in respect of four bank robberies committed on 
  August 2, August 16, August 26 and September 4, 1996 and with having his face 
  masked on August 16. Surveillance photographs were taken at all four robberies. 
  They show a person wearing sunglasses, a baseball cap and, in one case, a wig.</p>
<p>
  [4] On September 13, 1996, in the morning, the appellant was in a car with his 
  wife, Christine Knappett White, when the car was boxed in by several police 
  cars. The appellant was arrested for the bank robberies and his wife was arrested 
  as an accessory after the fact. The appellant saw his wife being handcuffed 
  and taken away in a separate police car.</p>
<p>[5] Individual police officers who interacted with the appellant testified 
  that the appellant made statements upon arrest, in the car on the way to the 
  police station and at the station during a strip search. They also claimed that 
  his videotaped confession was made without inducement. </p>
<p>
  [6] Detective Angle testified on the voir dire that he arrested the appellant 
  and read him his rights, but acknowledged that he did not ask the appellant 
  &quot;Do you want to call a lawyer now&quot;, although at the preliminary inquiry, 
  he had testified that he had. On the voir dire, Detective Angle's explanation 
  was that when he asked the appellant if he understood his rights, and before 
  asking if he wanted to call a lawyer now, the appellant interrupted him and 
  said: &quot;How did you find me?&quot;, &quot;Someone ratted on me, right?&quot; 
  and &quot;My wife doesn't know anything about this.&quot; Detective Angle said 
  he told the appellant he could call a lawyer when they got to the station. However, 
  he agreed that at the preliminary inquiry, when recounting this sequence, he 
  did not say that the appellant had interrupted him, but rather that he asked 
  the appellant if he wanted to &quot;call a lawyer now&quot;. The appellant testified 
  that he told Detective Angle he did want to contact his lawyer and was told 
  he would be able to do so at the station. He denied making any of the statements 
  attributed to him by Detective Angle. </p>
<p>
  [7] Detective Angle also searched the appellant on arrest. He first patted him 
  down and found nothing. Then, after talking to the appellant in the police car, 
  he removed him from it, searched him again and said he found several syringes 
  in his socks and back pocket, some of which were used. However, the officer 
  never recorded finding these items, nor were they retained.</p>
<p>
  [8] Detective Greenwood arrived after the arrest and joined Detective Angle 
  and the appellant on the ride back to the station. During the ride, Detective 
  Angle initiated conversation with the appellant about his heroin addiction. 
  The appellant asked about his wife and was told she was being charged. There 
  was an issue as to whether the appellant said she was on sick leave. The appellant 
  said they asked him why he committed the robberies and suggested it was because 
  he was doing drugs. The appellant denied taking drugs.</p>
<p>
  [9] The two detectives collaborated at the station on their notes, which were 
  in topic point form only.</p>
<p>
  [10] At the station the appellant was paraded before the desk sergeant who testified 
  that the appellant was given his right to counsel and that his handcuffs were 
  removed so that he could sign confirming that he did not want to call a lawyer. 
  The appellant denied signing anything at that point, as he was still handcuffed 
  behind his back. Also, he did want to speak to his lawyer. Both Detectives Angle 
  and Greenwood agreed that they did not remove the handcuffs until the appellant 
  was in an interview room upstairs at the station. Neither recalled the appellant 
  signing anything in front of the sergeant.</p>
<p>
  [11] Detective Greenwood took the appellant into an interrogation room to be 
  strip-searched and to obtain information for a show cause report. Detective 
  Angle came in and asked the appellant about the robberies saying they had photos 
  of the robber who appeared to be him. Detective Angle acknowledged in evidence 
  that in fact, the photos did not identify anyone. Detective Angle also agreed 
  that he asked the appellant investigative questions at that time and that the 
  appellant responded: &quot;I guess I'm done again. I don't know why people rat 
  on me. I never hurt anybody.&quot; Detective Angle then told the appellant he 
  could speak to them if he wished and the appellant said: &quot;I'm done.&quot; 
  The detective then asked the appellant if he wished to speak to a lawyer and 
  he answered &quot;no&quot;, and asked about his wife. Both officers said they 
  understood this inquiry to refer to her whereabouts and about how she was, not 
  to her arrest status. </p>
<p>
  [12] Detective Greenwood did not recall the appellant being asked about specific 
  offences or any of the specific utterances attributed to the appellant by Detective 
  Angle. Again, neither officer made contemporaneous notes about what was said 
  during the strip search. Detective Greenwood's note, made after the fact, contained 
  three topics: the offences discussed by Detective Angle but nothing from the 
  appellant; the right to counsel including a notation that Detective Angle asked 
  the appellant if he wanted to speak to a lawyer &quot;now&quot; and that he 
  said &quot;no&quot;; and, concerns raised by the appellant about his wife.</p>
<p>
  [13] The appellant testified that he asked to speak to his lawyer, Mr. McGee, 
  and was told he could do so later. It was at that point that the detectives 
  asked him to sign the record of arrest and to acknowledge that he had been advised 
  of his right to call counsel. He said he signed on the basis that they assured 
  him they would be allowing him to make the call, although he denied placing 
  the &quot;x&quot; in the box marked &quot;call not desired.&quot; He also denied 
  making any incriminating statements during the strip search.</p>
<p>
  [14] Following the strip search, the appellant was alone in an interrogation 
  room when Detective Earl entered for the purpose of interrogating him. Detective 
  Earl did not bring recording equipment or a witness. In accordance with his 
  practice, he wanted first to develop a rapport with the appellant. On the voir 
  dire, the trial judge protected him from answering questions about his knowledge 
  of the developing case law criticizing this practice. Detective Earl said that 
  he wrote down in his notebook each question and answer, but he did not have 
  the appellant sign the notebook. He said this was also his practice because 
  his writing is difficult to read. He said that the appellant confessed to the 
  four robberies, identified himself in the surveillance photographs and agreed 
  to provide an audio statement. Detectives Earl and Angle then returned to the 
  interview room and recorded the appellant's confession.</p>
<p>
  [15] The appellant said that Detective Earl entered the interview room, showed 
  him pictures of hold-ups at various banks and said they were pictures of him. 
  The appellant said he was not the man in the photos and that he wanted to call 
  a lawyer. The detective said if he confessed to the robberies, they would make 
  a deal with him. The appellant again denied the robberies. Detective Earl then 
  said if he did not confess, his wife would go down with him, that her name would 
  be in the newspapers, she would lose her job and the Children's Aid Society 
  would take her child away.</p>
<p>
  [16] The appellant's wife was a social worker with the Family Benefits Office 
  in Brampton. She was a single mother in a custody battle with her former spouse 
  over their child. That is why the appellant agreed to provide the statement. 
  He said Detective Earl told him that he committed the robberies because of his 
  heroin addiction, that he should make up the details and his wife would then 
  be released. He said that after he made the statement, his wife was brought 
  into the room for a few minutes although this was denied by the officers. His 
  wife was released without charge shortly thereafter. </p>
<p>
  [17] On the voir dire, the trial judge would not allow the police to answer 
  questions about the grounds they had for arresting his wife in the first place, 
  although the officers did not have any knowledge of any involvement by her. 
  </p>
<p>
  [18] The appellant testified on the voir dire and denied committing the robberies.</p>
<p>
  [19] In his ruling, the trial judge reviewed the evidence of the police in a 
  summary way, including their reasons for not making notes, Detective Earl's 
  denial that he knew about the appellant's wife, the appellant's evidence regarding 
  the inducement and his denial that he committed the robberies, and the fact 
  that his wife was released shortly after his taped confession was taken. The 
  trial judge then concluded: </p>
<p class="indent"> I propose to deal with the issues this way. I am satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements given to Detectives Earl and Angle 
  were voluntary. There were no inducements from pressure tactics about the accused's 
  wife being charged or not.</p>
<p class="indent">In a perfect setting, there should be a witness officer with 
  Earl, but I do not find that the oral statement given to Earl, and later confirmed 
  on tape, is nothing [sic] but reliable. I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt 
  as to its voluntariness.</p>
<p class="indent">I find that Mr. White was given his rights to counsel and elected 
  not to avail himself of counsel at the time of the interview.</p>
<p class="indent">In regard to Detective Angle, it would have been better to take 
  his notebook into the strip-search at the time, but I find his recollection 
  of a conversation with the accused is reliable, and I am satisfied beyond a 
  reasonable doubt as to its reliability and as to its voluntariness.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, the statements are admissible.</p>
<p>(b) Analysis</p>
<p>[20] At trial the appellant raised two issues regarding his statements: the 
  denial of counsel and the voluntariness issue. On appeal, he challenges the 
  admissibility of the statements on voluntariness alone. </p>
<p>
  [21] The law with respect to unrecorded police interrogations has recently been 
  stated by this court in R. v. Moore-MacFarlane (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 493, 
  where Charron J.A. said at para. 65: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; it is my view that that where the suspect is in custody, recording facilities 
  are readily available, and the police deliberately set out to interrogate the 
  suspect without giving any thought to the making of a reliable record, the context 
  inevitably makes the resulting non-recorded interrogation suspect. In such cases, 
  it will be a matter for the trial judge on the voir dire to determine whether 
  or not a sufficient substitute for an audio or video tape record has been provided 
  to satisfy the heavy onus on the crown to prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable 
  doubt.</p>
<p>and at para 67: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; in my view, the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the record 
  have everything to do with the court's inquiry into and scrutiny of the circumstances 
  surrounding the taking of the statement. Indeed, it is difficult to see how 
  the Crown could discharge its heavy onus of proving voluntariness beyond a reasonable 
  doubt where proper recording procedures are not followed.</p>
<p>The trial judge did not have the benefit of the Moore-MacFarlane decision at 
  the time of this trial. He acknowledged the deficiencies in the procedures used 
  by the officers, but was prepared to overlook them because he believed the officers' 
  recollection of the events and, perhaps more importantly, he believed that the 
  confession was true. </p>
<p>
  [22] Both Detectives Earl and Angle acknowledged that they set out to interrogate 
  the appellant without recording equipment. Detective Earl had also first approached 
  the appellant without a witness and Detective Angle interrogated the appellant 
  without taking notes. In those circumstances, the trial judge was required to 
  determine whether there was a sufficient substitute for a recording to satisfy 
  the &quot;heavy onus on the Crown to prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable 
  doubt.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [23] Rather than do that, the trial judge made bald findings that Detective 
  Earl gave no inducement for the appellant's confession and that Detective Angle's 
  version of the appellant's statements was reliable. Because there were significant 
  discrepancies between what Detective Greenwood recalled and noted of what the 
  appellant said during the strip search and Detective Angle's version, and because 
  there were also issues raised questioning Detective Angle's credibility regarding 
  his claim that he found syringes on the appellant, the trial judge's failure 
  to identify the indicia of reliability of Detective Angle's version is a serious 
  omission. A similar observation can be made about Detective Earl's denial that 
  he offered an inducement. In the face of the appellant's expressed concern about 
  his wife to other officers, her arrest when she had no involvement in the robberies, 
  and her release shortly after the confession, the trial judge did not explain 
  the basis of his finding in terms of indicia of reliability to satisfy the Crown's 
  onus. </p>
<p>
  [24] The trial judge gave no specific reasons for his conclusion that the confession 
  was true. Regardless of the existence of reasons, this court has held in R. 
  v. Sweeney (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 321 that it would only be in exceptional circumstances, 
  if ever, that a confession obtained involuntarily would be admitted into evidence 
  because of its reliability. There are no such circumstances in this case.</p>
<p>
  [25] In my view, this is a case where the voluntariness of the appellant's statements 
  is suspect. This is because the police set out twice to interrogate the appellant 
  without using the available recording equipment, and because there is nothing 
  in the evidence on the voir dire which could satisfy the court of the reliability 
  of the account of the officers. In those circumstances, the statements during 
  the strip search and the recorded confession following the unrecorded interview 
  with Detective Earl should not have been admitted.</p>
<p>
  II. The Identification Evidence</p>
<p>
  (a) The Evidence</p>
<p>[26] The only witness to the first robbery (count 1) was the bank teller, Mr. 
  Badillo. He observed the robber from one and one-half to two feet away, for 
  a minute or less. He gave a description which included a goatee that was light 
  brown, reddish, almost blonde. He acknowledged that the appellant's beard shadow 
  was not blonde. He was shown a photo line-up three and one-half months after 
  the robbery. He picked the photo of the appellant saying it looked &quot;similar&quot; 
  to the robber because of his jaw and lip-line. He identified the appellant in-dock 
  at both the preliminary inquiry and the trial.</p>
<p>
  [27] There were two teller witnesses to the second robbery (counts 2 and 3), 
  Ms. Pacek and Ms. DaSilva. The first was the teller approached by the robber. 
  She was very nervous and was unable to see his eyes because of the sunglasses. 
  She observed a square chin and his height. The second witness, the customer 
  service manager, observed his height and said she could not say if the robber 
  was male or female because of the disguise. On this occasion, the robber wore 
  a wig, makeup, sunglasses and a baseball cap. Neither of these witnesses picked 
  any photo from the photo line-up nor made an in-dock identification.</p>
<p>
  [28] There were also two witnesses to the third robbery (count 4). One was the 
  teller, Ms. Duarte. She denied that the robber was wearing a hat or sunglasses, 
  although the surveillance camera shows that he was. She picked the appellant's 
  photo out of a photo line-up, saying it was &quot;something like&quot; him. 
  She was satisfied because of the deep sunken eyes. She made an in-dock identification. 
  The other witness was another bank employee, Ms. Souza. She also maintained 
  that the robber never wore sunglasses. She picked the appellant's photo from 
  the photo line-up and she identified the appellant in-dock, based on the shape 
  of his jaw and his hair.</p>
<p>
  [29] There was one witness to the fourth robbery (count 5), Ms. Waizi. She agreed 
  that she only had a glimpse of the robber because the event was sudden and because 
  she was shocked and scared. She picked the appellant's photo from a photo line-up 
  and maintained that she could identify him from his eyes, although she acknowledged 
  that he was wearing sunglasses. She also identified the appellant in-dock.</p>
<p>
  (b) The Charge on Identification</p>
<p>[30] It is conceded by the Crown that the trial judge's charge to the jury 
  on eyewitness identification contained the same errors as in R. v. Francis (2002), 
  165 O.A.C. 131. Consequently, the convictions on counts 1, 4 and 5 must be set 
  aside. As in Francis, the trial judge erred first by instructing jurors that 
  stress was not a strong factor to consider in assessing the eyewitness identification, 
  and second by suggesting to the jurors that they close their eyes and consider 
  if they might be able to describe the juror sitting next to them. As stated 
  in Francis, experiments of this nature are always dangerous because they bear 
  no relationship to the circumstances facing the bank tellers at the time of 
  the robberies and since they ask jurors to describe someone with whom they are 
  acquainted, rather than someone who is a stranger to them.</p>
<p>
  III. Unreasonable Verdicts</p>
<p>[31] The next issue is whether, without the confessions, the verdicts are unreasonable 
  based on only the identification evidence and the surveillance photographs. 
  </p>
<p>
  [32] The test for unreasonable verdict is whether, on the evidence that was 
  before the trial court, a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could 
  have convicted the accused. In making this determination the appeal court must 
  re-examine the evidence and, to some extent, reweigh and consider its effect. 
  See R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168 at paras. 23 and 25 and R. v. Biniaris, 
  [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381.</p>
<p>
  [33] Dealing first with the surveillance photographs, opinion evidence was given 
  by Detective Earl that the appellant could be identified from the photographs. 
  Detective Angle, on the other hand, acknowledged at trial that nobody, including 
  the appellant, could be identified from the photographs. Based on these discrepancies 
  and the fact that the Crown does not urge in its factum that the photos provide 
  identification evidence implicating the appellant, I conclude that the surveillance 
  photographs provide very weak, if any evidence, on the issue.</p>
<p>
  [34] As the verdicts on counts 2 and 3 are based only on the appellant's statement 
  and the photographs, it is clear that without the statements, those verdicts 
  are unreasonable and must be quashed.</p>
<p>
  [35] The eyewitness identification evidence on each of the three remaining counts 
  is problematic. On count 1, the appellant submits that the situation is factually 
  similar to that in R. v. Reitsma (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). The Crown 
  distinguishes Reitsma on the basis that in that case the witness only saw the 
  robber for 15 seconds and his reasons for not choosing the accused's picture 
  from the photo line-up were not consistent with what could be seen in the line-up. 
  Here, Mr. Badillo made his in-dock identification based on the appellant's jaw 
  line and lips and picked out the appellant's photo from the photo line-up as 
  looking most similar to the robber. He saw the robber for approximately one 
  minute or less. However, the description he provided to the police did not match 
  the appellant in terms of hair colour and length, and facial hair at the time 
  of the appellant's arrest.</p>
<p>
  [36] On count 4, the teller, Ms. Duarte gave a detailed description of the robber 
  including dark shoulder length hair, long oval face, unshaven and dark sunken 
  eyes. Although the surveillance camera showed the robber with sunglasses, she 
  insisted that he was not wearing sunglasses when she served him at the counter. 
  She identified him in the photo line-up from the length of his face and chin, 
  the length of his hair and the sunken eyes, although she said the photo was 
  &quot;something like him&quot;. She identified him in-dock based on the same 
  features. Ms. Souza saw the robber over a period of two minutes. She insisted 
  as well that he was not wearing sunglasses although she acknowledged that the 
  surveillance photograph showed the robber wearing sunglasses as he approached 
  the wicket. She picked the appellant's photo from a photo line-up and was definite 
  in her choice.</p>
<p>
  [37] On count 5, the only witness was the teller, Ms. Waizi. She was very scared 
  throughout. She described the robber as having brown eyes, unshaven, long black 
  curly hair, a gray jacket or a baseball cap. She never said he wore sunglasses 
  although she acknowledged that the surveillance tape showed that he was wearing 
  them while she served him. She picked the appellant's picture from a photo line-up 
  based on the eyes, the unshaven face and the long hair.</p>
<p>
  [38] In my view, a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could not convict 
  the appellant on count 1 based only on the evidence of Mr. Badillo. His description 
  did not match the appellant and he could not positively pick out the appellant 
  from the photo line-up. The in-dock identification is of virtually no weight 
  (R. v. Hibbert (2002), 211 D.L.R. (4th) 223). Similarly, on count 5, the only 
  witness's description of the robber with no sunglasses is clearly an error. 
  She also identified the appellant, in part based on his eyes. In those circumstances 
  her evidence alone could not form the basis for a conviction by a jury acting 
  reasonably.</p>
<p>
  [39] On count 4, although the evidence has some problematic aspects, in my view 
  it cannot be said that a jury could not act on that evidence, given the consistency 
  between the two witnesses.</p>
<p>
  IV. Conclusion</p>
<p>[40] I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the convictions, enter acquittals 
  on counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 and order a new trial on count 4. </p>
<p>
  [41] The Crown's position on this appeal was that the statements were properly 
  admitted, and that the convictions based on the statements on counts 2 and 3 
  should stand as the error in the charge on eyewitness identification evidence 
  did not affect these counts. On that basis the Crown suggested that the sentence 
  of 10 years in prison, one-half be served before the appellant is eligible for 
  parole, should be varied to time served of just over 4 years. As those convictions 
  have been set aside with the others and a new trial ordered on only one count, 
  if the same sentence of time served is viewed as appropriate if the appellant 
  were to be convicted of that count, the Crown may choose not to proceed with 
  a new trial. </p>
