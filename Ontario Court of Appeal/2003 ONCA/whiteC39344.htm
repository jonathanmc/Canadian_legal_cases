<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Timothy C. Whetung, of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice, dated December 12, 2002.</p>
<p>
  GILLESE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Lawrence White pled guilty to, and was convicted of, criminal harassment, 
  five counts of breach of probation and breach of recognizance. All of the offences 
  occurred as a result of Mr. White's attempts to reconcile with his family after 
  his marriage ended. </p>
<p>
  [2] Mr. White served approximately eighty days in pre-hearing custody, for which 
  he was credited 160 days. In addition, he was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment 
  followed by three years probation. He appealed from sentence, asking that he 
  be permitted to serve the sentence in the community or, alternatively, that 
  the period of incarceration be reduced. At the hearing of the appeal, he abandoned 
  his request that he be permitted to serve his sentence in the community. The 
  sentence appeal was argued on the basis that it was excessive. </p>
<p>
  [3] For the following reasons, I am of the view that the sentence imposed reveals 
  an error in principle. I would reduce the sentence to time served, all other 
  conditions remaining unchanged, for an effective sentence of 12 months. </p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [4] In the summer of 2001, Lawrence White was forty-eight years old. He had 
  never had any interaction with the criminal justice system. He had been married 
  for fifteen years to Janice White and they had two sons, Patrick and Andrew, 
  who were aged 12 and 9 respectively.</p>
<p>
  [5] At that time, Mr. White, a labourer with the Lakefield Public Works department, 
  operated heavy machinery. He was a good employee and had held his position with 
  the municipality for twelve and a half years. </p>
<p>
  [6] In the fall of 2000, the White family decided to relocate from Lakefield 
  to Peterborough. The family moved into its second choice of home, one that required 
  interior work. Mr. White commuted to Lakefield on a daily basis in order to 
  continue his employment. Although the move had been agreed upon between Lawrence 
  White and his wife, he began to find the situation very stressful.</p>
<p>
  [7] Mr. White started to experience severe anxiety that developed into palpitations, 
  nervousness and tremors. He suffered from loss of sleep and lack of appetite 
  and developed a pessimistic outlook on life. His behaviour took a toll on his 
  marriage and, after his admission into the Peterborough Regional Health Centre 
  for the first of many psychological assessments, he and his wife separated. 
  </p>
<p>
  [8] In the summer of 2001, the appellant hoped to reconcile with his family 
  and began to engage in the behaviour that brought him before the criminal justice 
  system. It is helpful to consider his behaviour in September and October of 
  2002, which led to the current convictions, separately from his behaviour that 
  began in the summer of 2001 and continued until the late spring of 2002.</p>
<p>
  The Current Conviction Offences</p>
<p>
  [9] On September 2, 2002, Janice White was building a deck on the back of her 
  house when she observed the appellant drive by at least twelve times. At the 
  time, the appellant was on three separate probation orders; a term of all three 
  orders was that he not have contact with Janice White. She did not contact the 
  police at the time.</p>
<p>
  [10] On September 6, 2002, following a scheduled visitation with his two sons, 
  the appellant approached Janice, Patrick, and Andrew White at a sports store. 
  He asked Janice White if he could have his hunting knife. She refused. He told 
  her that he could pick it up at the house, since it was dark and no one would 
  see, but Janice White told him not to go to her home. Approximately an hour 
  later, at 10:00 p.m., the appellant went to Janice White's residence and rang 
  the doorbell. At first, Ms. White was unable to see anyone outside because the 
  appellant stood flat against the side of the house. When she saw the appellant, 
  she shook her head to indicate &quot;no&quot; and he left. Ms. White reported 
  this incident to the police.</p>
<p>
  [11] Over the course of the following three days, the police looked for the 
  appellant at his home and place of work, without success. On September 10, 2002, 
  he turned himself in to the police. On September 18, 2002, the appellant was 
  released on bail on his own recognizance.</p>
<p>
  [12] On October 2, 2002, the appellant approached Janice, Patrick and Andrew 
  in the parking lot of the Kinsmen arena. He handed Janice a card and a fishing 
  rod. The card read &quot;Sending you love and hoping things are better soon, 
  with love to you all -XOXOXO - I miss everything&quot;. He then handed each 
  of his sons a chocolate bar and a loonie. Ms. White contacted the police on 
  October 3, 2002.</p>
<p>
  Convictions in 2001-2002</p>
<p>
  [13] On August 7, 2001, the appellant was convicted of criminal harassment against 
  Janice White and breach of recognizance. He received a fifty-eight day intermittent 
  sentence followed by two years probation. By a term of probation, he was to 
  have no contact with Janice, Patrick or Andrew, except through a family court 
  order. </p>
<p>
  [14] The appellant was arrested and convicted of breach of probation on October 
  2, 2001 and given a three-month conditional sentence.</p>
<p>
  [15] On October 22, 2001, Mr. White was arrested again for contacting his wife 
  and children. He was held in custody until November 2, 2001, at which time his 
  conditional sentence was terminated. He served the remainder of the sentence 
  in custody. He was released from custody on December 11, 2001. </p>
<p>
  [16] The following day, December 12, 2001, Mr. White approached his children 
  at their school and was arrested for breach of probation. He received a sentence 
  of thirty days intermittent followed by two years probation. A term of probation 
  was that he have no contact with Janice, Patrick, or Andrew, except through 
  a family court order.</p>
<p>
  [17] On April 23, 2002, he was convicted of criminal harassment and sentenced 
  to two years probation. He had served seventy-eight days of pre-sentence custody. 
  A term of the probation order was that he have no contact with Janice, Patrick, 
  or Andrew.</p>
<p>
  The Sentence under Appeal</p>
<p>
  [18] The sentencing judge concluded (at p. 19) that general and specific deterrence 
  were the dominant considerations, as prior sentences that focussed on rehabilitation 
  had proven ineffective: </p>
<p class="indent"> In my opinion at this time he requires a sentence directed 
  towards specific deterrence and the community requires a sentence directed towards 
  general deterrence. The rehabilitative aspects will be attempted to be addressed 
  but they are matters, in my opinion, which are subordinate to specific and general 
  deterrence at this time.</p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion, the conduct of Mr. White, based upon the history 
  of his involvement with the courts and the history of his involvement with these 
  complainants is so serious that, absent the mitigation to be attached to a plea 
  of guilty and his acceptance of responsibility in these matters, a penitentiary 
  sentence would not be inappropriate. But, having said that, I am obliged to 
  attach mitigation to his acceptance of responsibility in the circumstances in 
  which it occurred&#133;</p>
<p>
  [19] The judge rejected the possibility of a conditional sentence because he 
  had no confidence that the appellant would abide by any conditions that the 
  court might impose. </p>
<p>
  Fitness of Sentence</p>
<p>
  [20] No objection can be taken to the trial judge's imposition of a period of 
  imprisonment. In accordance with this court's jurisprudence (see, for example, 
  R. v. Bates (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Ont. C.A.)) and in light of the appellant's 
  continued refusal to abide by court orders, a period of incarceration was required 
  in order to denounce his conduct, provide specific and general deterrence and 
  meet the complainant's safety needs.</p>
<p>
  [21] However, having regard to the circumstances of these offences and of this 
  appellant, in my view the period of incarceration is excessive. The following 
  factors lead to this conclusion: a) the absence of violence in the offences; 
  b) the appellant's lack of a criminal record prior to the break up of his family; 
  c) the significant increase in sentence; d) the appellant's emotional and psychological 
  problems; and, e) the fact that the appellant had taken steps to receive counselling.</p>
<p>
  [22] The appellant's actions do not bear the aggravating factors that warrant 
  a sentence in the upper reformatory range. In Bates, supra, the accused pled 
  guilty to one charge of criminal harassment, three charges of assault and six 
  charges of failure to comply. He was found guilty, after trial, of uttering 
  a death threat. Over a three-month period, the accused engaged in an escalating 
  pattern of harassment of a former girlfriend and her friends and repeatedly 
  breached judicial release orders.</p>
<p>
  [23] The offences in Bates began in September 1998 when, during an argument, 
  the accused used profanity and called the complainant names. He slapped her 
  across the face, knocking her to the floor. He then picked her up and threw 
  her against a cupboard where she struck her head. She suffered bruising to her 
  face and hip. The complainant ended their relationship but he continued to telephone 
  her and attend at her home and workplace. He assaulted her again a month later. 
  As a result of the second assault, he was arrested and released on a promise 
  not to communicate with the complainant or her friends. Five days later the 
  accused returned to the complainant's home, looking for her. He entered her 
  home while the family was out.</p>
<p>
  [24] On other occasions, he used threats involving profanity; followed and harassed 
  her friends to the point they considered moving, changing their phone and licence 
  numbers out of fear for their lives; accosted the complainant at her place of 
  work and when she refused to go with him, showed her a gun and two bullets, 
  saying one was for her and the other for him. He took the complainant's purse 
  and went through her diary. He told her she deserved to die. The victim impact 
  statement showed that the complainant feared for her life. He avoided arrest 
  for a lengthy period. The medical evidence was that he did not suffer from any 
  disorder; he was immature. He had a lengthy criminal record. On appeal, this 
  court sentenced the accused to thirty months, inclusive of pre-trial custody. 
  </p>
<p>
  [25] In R. v. Thomas, [2001] O.J. No. 2220 (C.A.), after referring to Bates, 
  this court stated that a sentence of three years was &quot;at the upper end 
  of the range&quot;. The accused in Thomas was convicted of criminal harassment, 
  had a lengthy criminal record, had been convicted of assaulting the victim twice 
  before, had shown no regard for court orders, and was in breach of three probation 
  orders at the time of the offences. </p>
<p>
  [26] The gravity of the appellant's offences is materially different from those 
  in Bates and Thomas. There were no assaults, profanity, threats or home invasions. 
  There was no violence and no threatened violence against the complainant. Indeed, 
  there was no history of violence nor were there allegations that Mr. White was 
  abusive or violent during the marriage. He had no record prior to the break 
  up of his family. He did not harass the complainant's friends and family. The 
  appellant took responsibility for the offences, turning himself in to the police 
  and pleading guilty to all of the offences.</p>
<p>
  [27] While a term of imprisonment was warranted, given his prior convictions 
  for criminal harassment and breach of probation, the increase was excessive. 
  His prior sentences were for short periods of incarceration (58 days and 30 
  days), both of which were to be served intermittently, and a conditional sentence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [28] Several medical and psychiatric opinion letters were filed as exhibits 
  at sentencing. All of the physicians agreed that the appellant was having difficulty 
  coping with his personal situation. While there was a divergence of medical 
  opinion as to the root of the appellant's behaviour, two physicians were of 
  the opinion that he suffered from obsessive/compulsive disorder. Three others 
  were of the view that he suffered from depression. The consensus was that further 
  treatment, either through continued medication, counselling, or both, should 
  be implemented. The opportunity for rehabilitation through such treatment is 
  hampered by incarceration.</p>
<p>
  [29] The appellant has a &quot;mild disposition&quot;. When addressing the court 
  at the time of sentencing, the appellant spoke of the effect that the pre-hearing 
  custody had had upon him and stated that he was going to a separation and divorce 
  group. He spoke also of the stresses he faced in prison as a person without 
  a criminal background. He acknowledged the need to recognize that his relationship 
  with his wife was over and his need to seriously pursue treatment and counselling.</p>
<p>
  [30] The appellant's time in pre-hearing custody impressed upon him the need 
  for rehabilitation and his further incarceration for seven months will have 
  reinforced that need.</p>
<p>
  [31] In light of these considerations, a sentence of 23 months was excessive.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [32] Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal from sentence, allow the appeal 
  and vary the sentence to one of time served. I would leave the term of three 
  years probation, and attached conditions, unchanged.</p>
<p> &quot;E.E. Gillese J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree John I. Laskin J.A.&quot;</p>

<p>MACPHERSON J.A. (Dissenting): </p>
<p>
  [33] I have had the opportunity to read the draft reasons prepared by my colleague, 
  Gillese J.A. With respect and regret, I do not agree with her proposed disposition 
  of the appeal. In my view, the sentence imposed by Whetung J. was not based 
  on an error in principle; nor was it excessive. Hence, I would dismiss the appeal. 
  Because my colleague has set out the factual background in a clear and comprehensive 
  fashion, I can state my reasons in relatively brief compass. My reasons essentially 
  boil down to two points.</p>
<p>
  [34] First, in a long line of recent cases the Supreme Court of Canada has sent 
  a crystal clear message to appellate courts reviewing sentences imposed by trial 
  judges. As expressed by Lamer C.J.C. in the latest of this line of cases, R. 
  v. Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61 at 124, &quot;this court has repeatedly stated 
  that the sentence imposed by a trial court is entitled to considerable deference 
  from appellate courts&quot;. The reasons for this standard of review of &quot;considerable 
  deference&quot; were vividly explained by Lamer C.J.C. in R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 
  1 S.C.R. 500 at 565-66: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This deferential standard of review has profound functional justifications. 
  As Iacobucci J. explained in Shropshire [R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227] 
  at para. 46, where the sentencing judge has had the benefit of presiding over 
  the trial of the offender, he or she will have had the comparative advantage 
  of having seen and heard the witnesses to the crime. But in the absence of a 
  full trial, where the offender has pleaded guilty to an offence and the sentencing 
  judge has only enjoyed the benefit of oral and written sentencing submissions 
  (as was the case in both Shropshire and this instance), the argument in favour 
  of deference remains compelling. A sentencing judge still enjoys a position 
  of advantage over an appellate judge in being able to directly assess the sentencing 
  submissions of both the Crown and the offender. A sentencing judge also possesses 
  the unique qualifications of experience and judgment from having served on the 
  front lines of our criminal justice system. Perhaps most importantly, the sentencing 
  judge will normally preside near or within the community which has suffered 
  the consequences of the offender's crime. As such, the sentencing judge will 
  have a strong sense of the particular blend of sentencing goals that will be 
  &quot;just and appropriate&quot; for the protection of that community. The determination 
  of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attempts to balance 
  carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness 
  of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking 
  into account the needs and current conditions of and in the community. The discretion 
  of a sentencing judge should thus not be interfered with lightly.</p>
<p>
  [35] In the present case, the sentencing judge's reasons are 22 pages in length. 
  He delivered his reasons after receiving a good deal of relevant information 
  and material (from the appellant, the complainant, doctors, the police and a 
  probation officer) and after hearing full submissions from counsel. The sentencing 
  process was comprehensive and deliberate, not hurried. The sentencing judge's 
  reasons were detailed, lucid and balanced, not cursory, muddled or unfair. Accordingly, 
  the standard of review enunciated in Proulx - &quot;considerable deference&quot; 
  - is especially appropriate in this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [36] Second, this court has taken a strong stand in recent years against domestic 
  violence and harassment. Spouses (usually women) and children deserve protection 
  from abusive spouses and parents. The safety of vulnerable family members must 
  dwarf all other considerations. This court has recognized and given voice to 
  this message in consistent and forceful language. The leading case, in my view, 
  is R. v. Bates (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 321. After a full canvass of the relevant 
  facts, Criminal Code provisions, case law and sentencing principles, Moldaver 
  and Feldman JJ.A. set out a clear and compelling summary, at p. 334: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The number of recent cases continuing to reach this court emphasizes the extent 
  of the problem of criminal harassment and the need for sentencing courts to 
  respond to this type of offence in the most forceful and effective terms, sending 
  the message of denunciation and general deterrence to the community, and specific 
  deterrence to individual offenders.</p>
<p>
  [37] In the present case, the appellant was convicted of criminal harassment 
  against his estranged wife. Accordingly, the above passage from Bates, the leading 
  case dealing with sentencing principles for the offence of criminal harassment 
  in a domestic setting, must govern this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [38] In my view, the sentencing judge's reasons are entirely and explicitly 
  consistent with the ratio from Bates. After reviewing the appellant's conduct 
  over an 18-month period and the sentences he had received for previous offences, 
  the sentencing judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This conduct on the part of Mr. White must stop and sentences imposed by the 
  court in the past have clearly accommodated his personal expressed position 
  that he requires rehabilitation. In my opinion at this time he requires a sentence 
  directed towards specific deterrence and the community requires a sentence directed 
  towards general deterrence. The rehabilitative aspects will be attempted to 
  be addressed but they are matters, in my opinion, which are subordinate to specific 
  and general deterrence at this time.</p>
<p>
  [39] It is true that there are factual differences between this case and Bates. 
  The most important is the absence of physical violence in this case and the 
  serious violence in Bates. However, the sentencing objective of specific deterrence 
  is directed at preventing future crimes. On the record in this case, the risk 
  of the appellant's harassing behaviour potentially turning to violence is all 
  too apparent. </p>
<p>
  [40] For example, Detective Sergeant Joey Gauthier of the Threat Assessment 
  Unit of the Ontario Provincial Police prepared a six-page report about the appellant. 
  His conclusion was that &quot;Mr. White presents a moderate risk for potential 
  violence.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [41] The complainant also dealt with the question of violence in her victim 
  impact statement: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Several Officers have commented and also Marty Murphy the fact that in the past 
  Mr. White has not been violent. However, my answer is no but he also has never 
  acted this strangely before either. What is a person to think when he stalks 
  me and finds me at a store at 9:00 p.m. and wants to come by the house to pick 
  up his hunting knife?</p>
<p>
  [42] The sentencing judge attached weight, as he was entitled to do, to the 
  opinions of the complainant and Detective Sergeant Gauthier. He said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The crux of this matter is, I think, summed up by Sergeant Gauthier: &quot;Any 
  approached behaviours on his part at this time may be cause for concern.&quot; 
  It is not my role to judge with nicety the nuances of Mr. White's intentions 
  or potential intentions. What he is doing is causing fear. What he is doing 
  appears to be escalating from the standpoint of the perception created in the 
  mind of the complainant and I cannot disagree [with] that, when he begins to 
  talk about things like coming to the house to get a knife because it is dark 
  and no one can see him or words to that effect, that this would be a matter 
  of concern, especially to a complainant in the circumstances of which Mrs. White 
  finds herself where nothing done to this point seems to work. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [43] In addition, this court has made it clear that the principles from Bates 
  apply to criminal harassment convictions where the harassment was not joined 
  to physical violence. In R. v. Finnessey (2000), 135 O.A.C. 396, the court (Osborne 
  A.C.J.O. and Doherty and Charron JJ.A.) set out the ratio from Bates, as quoted 
  above, and continued, at p. 399: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Those principles apply with full force even where there is no physical violence. 
  The absence of physical violence is not a mitigating factor on a conviction 
  for harassment. The psychological violence done to the complainant and her friends 
  over a prolonged period by the respondent's conduct is the very evil that Parliament 
  sought to punish by creating the crime of harassment. The fact that the respondent 
  did not commit additional crimes involving physical violence cannot mitigate 
  his sentence on the harassment charge.</p>
<p>
  [44] In her draft reasons, my colleague identifies five factors which lead her 
  to conclude that the appellant's incarceration is excessive: a) the absence 
  of violence; b) the appellant's lack of a criminal record prior to the break 
  up of his family; c) the significant increase in sentence; d) the appellant's 
  emotional and psychological problems; and e) the fact that the appellant had 
  taken steps to receive counselling. I have already commented on the violence 
  factor. I should comment, briefly, on the other four factors.</p>
<p>
  [45] The appellant's lack of a criminal record prior to the break up of his 
  family is, with respect, irrelevant. The problem is a rapidly expanding, bordering 
  on continuous, pattern of criminal conduct since the break up that is directed 
  at his family.</p>
<p>
  [46] It is true that a sentence of 23 months was a significant &quot;step up&quot; 
  from the three previous sentences. However, the sentencing judge's candid reasons 
  for the escalation are, in my view, supportable.</p>
<p>
  [47] The appellant's emotional and psychological problems are sad and deserving 
  of sympathy. However, at this juncture the sentencing judge was entitled to 
  conclude that specific deterrence of the appellant and the safety of his family 
  must take priority.</p>
<p>
  [48] The appellant's commitment to counselling is, in my view, doubtful. Tamara 
  Look was the appellant's probation officer for a year. In a report to the Crown 
  attorney in September 2002, she stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Dr. Moher advised that Lawrence had missed his last two appointments and had 
  only recently contacted him seeking support for unsupervised visits with his 
  children.</p>
<p class="indent"> . . . . .</p>
<p class="indent"> Discussed his continual stopping and starting medication, which 
  doesn't help his mental health in the least. Also wants a new psychiatrist as 
  Dr. Moher challenges everything he says.</p>
<p class="indent"> . . . . .</p>
<p class="indent"> Despite repeated and continual reminders of the conditions 
  of his probation order, Lawrence continues to violate these conditions, with 
  little regard for the impact of his behaviour on his victims, which is his own 
  family.</p>
<p class="indent"> Lawrence has done little to help himself in this regard and 
  has attempted to deceive all members of the various community agencies that
