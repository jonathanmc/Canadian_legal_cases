<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice Roydon Kealey of the Superior Court 
  of Justice on October 5, 2000.</p>

<p> ROSENBERG J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from his conviction by Kealey J. and a jury on four 
  counts of conspiracy. While the appellant raised a number of grounds of appeal, 
  the principal ground of appeal concerns the conduct of the application to exclude 
  wiretap evidence. The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in refusing 
  the appellant and his co-accused permission to cross-examine the affiant and 
  the sub-affiants. I agree with that submission and accordingly would allow the 
  appeal and order a new trial.</p>
<p> THE FACTS</p>
<p> [2] In view of my conclusion concerning the conduct of the wiretap application, 
  it is only necessary to provide a brief summary of the facts. The Crown alleged 
  that the appellant was involved in a conspiracy to smuggle liquor and cigarettes 
  from the United States into Canada through the Akwesasne First Nations Reserve. 
  By August 1995, the Cornwall detachment of the R.C.M.P. had begun an investigation 
  into this activity. Significantly, within a relatively short time an undercover 
  officer, Sergeant Nicholson, had infiltrated the smuggling operation run by 
  Ande Fuller and the appellant&#8217;s co-accused Randy Jareo. Nicholson saw 
  the appellant with Jareo or his associates on two occasions. However, the Crown&#8217;s 
  case against the appellant depended on several telephone calls that were intercepted 
  under an authorization granted on November 17, 1995.</p>
<p> [3] The November 17th authorization was granted in the following circumstances. 
  By November 1995, the Cornwall investigators had begun to prepare their own 
  application for a wiretap authorization. However, the Kitchener detachment of 
  the R.C.M.P. was engaged in a related investigation concerning liquor smuggling 
  and had already obtained a wiretap authorization in September 1995 that was 
  to expire on November 17th. The police agreed to &#8220;piggyback&#8221; the 
  Cornwall investigation on to the Kitchener investigation and apply for an expanded 
  authorization that would include the Cornwall suspects. The affiant for the 
  expanded authorization was Constable Foster. While Foster (the affiant) had 
  first hand knowledge of the Kitchener investigation, his information about the 
  Cornwall investigation came from the Cornwall officers (the sub-affiants).</p>
<p> [4] The procedure adopted at the trial to deal with the challenge to the wiretap 
  authorization was somewhat unusual. The appellant and his co-accused were permitted 
  to call on the voir dire, as their witnesses, the affiant and four of the Cornwall 
  investigators who supplied information to the affiant about the Cornwall investigation. 
  With this evidence the appellant and his co-accused hoped to demonstrate a basis 
  for cross-examining the affiant and the sub-affiants. If they were permitted 
  to conduct this cross-examination, they then hoped to establish that authorization 
  should be set aside. If the authorization was set aside, the interception of 
  the appellant&#8217;s private communications would violate s. 8 of the Canadian 
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms and thus the communications would be liable to 
  be excluded from evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter.</p>
<p> [5] There seems to have been some confusion at trial as to the scope of the 
  examination of the witnesses on the application. I will return to that issue 
  after considering the evidence that the defence obtained during the voir dire 
  and the trial judge&#8217;s ruling. The focus of the voir dire was on the investigative 
  necessity criterion in s. 186 of the Criminal Code. The relevant part of the 
  section is the following:</p>
<p class="indent"> 186. (1) An authorization under this section may be given if 
  the judge to whom the application is made is satisfied</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) that it would be in the best interests of the administration 
  of justice to do so; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) that other investigative procedures have been tried and 
  have failed, other investigative procedures are unlikely to succeed or the urgency 
  of the matter is such that it would be impractical to carry out the investigation 
  of the offence using only other investigative procedures [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [6] It was the defence position that there were other investigative procedures 
  that could have been employed. In fact, other procedures had proved very successful 
  and therefore it was argued that the Crown had not shown that &#8220;other investigative 
  procedures were unlikely to succeed&#8221; within the meaning of s. 186(1)(b). 
  There is no suggestion that the Crown sought to justify the necessity for the 
  authorization on the two alternatives&#8212;other investigative procedures have 
  been tried and have failed or urgency.</p>
<p> [7] In the course of the voir dire, through examination of the affiant and 
  the sub-affiants, the appellant showed that Sergeant Nicholson had been highly 
  successful in infiltrating the Fuller/Jareo smuggling operation to the point 
  that he had been invited to participate as an equal partner in the operation. 
  Nicholson had also offered money-laundering services that the other members 
  of the operation were considering. The officers appeared to concede that both 
  of these ploys if pursued by Nicholson could lead to identifying the &#8220;higher-ups&#8221; 
  in the conspiracy and provide evidence of Jareo and Fuller&#8217;s involvement 
  in money-laundering, two of the key goals of the investigation. There was also 
  a possibility that Nicholson would be able to infiltrate the United States side 
  of the operation. Following the granting of the authorization, Nicholson did 
  travel to the United States to view part of the United States operation. </p>
<p> [8] The police had been able to infiltrate a second undercover officer, Corporal 
  Fair, into the Fuller/Jareo operation, but his involvement was somewhat limited. 
  The police were also using one police agent, Donald Davidson, and may have been 
  able to use the services of a second agent. They were making some use of surveillance 
  from aircraft. They had also identified a distillery and warehouse involved 
  in the smuggling operation. </p>
<p> [9] On the other hand, there were impediments to the continuing undercover 
  operation. In particular, it seems that Sergeant Nicholson may have been known 
  as a police officer to one of the persons suspected to be at the highest level 
  of the conspiracy. Further, physical surveillance on the reserve from the Canadian 
  side was difficult and it was difficult to identify contraband-laden vehicles. 
  The officers also had decided not to pursue the partnership option, although 
  the reasons for that decision were less than clear. In short, the officers offered 
  the opinion that the undercover operation was stalemated. </p>
<p> THE TRIAL JUDGE&#8217;S REASONS</p>
<p> [10] The trial judge refused to permit the appellant and his co-accused to 
  cross-examine the affiant and the sub-affiants. The relevant part of his reasons 
  are as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> The late Mr. Justice Sopinka in the Garfoli case suggests that 
  cross-examination be available if leave is obtained from the trial judge whose 
  discretion in this regard ought to permit same, where it is necessary to enable 
  full answer and defence, provided the accused can demonstrate on some basis 
  that such a cross-examination will likely provide testimony tending to discredit 
  the existence of any one of the preconditions to an authorization. It seems 
  to me in determining whether the test can be met, the trial judge should not 
  exact a high standard but, indeed, a lenient one.</p>
<p class="indent">In this matter I permitted defence counsel to lead and to be 
  freer in eliciting testimony from their witnesses called to support the motion 
  because as police officers they appear somewhat adverse in interest. I am not 
  persuaded in any way that further cross-examination would challenge any of the 
  preconditions for authorization. The overlap in the Kitchener and Cornwall investigations 
  which became known in late October or early November 1995 required full disclosure 
  in the November 17th application. This was done in a lengthy meeting attended 
  by officers Foster, Thompson, Dempster and Butler I believe on November the 
  9th and was included in Foster&#8217;s affidavit.</p>
<p class="indent">Obviously, it is difficult, if not impossible, to recount every 
  detail of a complex, lengthy investigation, but it seems to me any shortcoming 
  in the detail disclosed could hardly be considered a material misrepresentation. 
  The areas of concern advanced by the defendants, namely, possible partnership, 
  money laundering and this proposed U.S. surveillance plan, as well as the other 
  grounds set out in their application, even if true do not lead to the conclusion 
  that there was any fraud or misrepresentation which caused an abuse of this 
  court&#8217;s process.</p>
<p class="indent">Surely, the investigator can and would be expected to consider 
  and explore whatever other avenues might provide fruitful evidence. From both 
  the Cornwall and Kitchener perspectives, all efforts to November 17th had failed 
  and would continue to be unsuccessful in their objective to penetrate the higher 
  echelons of the participants in the criminal activity involved, or to identify 
  unknown co-conspirators, or to learn more detail as to the importation and distribution 
  network and, most importantly, to provide sufficient evidence to prosecute the 
  individuals involved.</p>
<p class="indent">It seems to me to permit cross-examinations here would be a 
  colossal waste of the court&#8217;s time with no likelihood of generating relevant 
  evidence and, as such, the defendant&#8217;s request in this regard is denied 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>ANALYSIS</p>
<p> Cross-examination of the affiant and sub-affiants</p>
<p> [11] The test for permitting cross-examination of an affiant whose affidavit 
  has been used to obtain a wiretap authorization is not a stringent one. Sopinka 
  J. set out the test as follows in R. v. Garofoli (1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 161 
  (S.C.C.) at 198:</p>
<p class="indent"> Leave must be obtained to cross-examine. The granting of leave 
  must be left to the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge. Leave should 
  be granted when the trial judge is satisfied that cross-examination is necessary 
  to enable the accused to make full answer and defence. A basis must be shown 
  by the accused for the view that the cross-examination will elicit testimony 
  tending to discredit the existence of one of the pre-conditions to the authorization, 
  as for example the existence of reasonable and probable grounds.</p>
<p> [12] In the passage I have set out above from his reasons, the trial judge 
  accurately stated this test. However, in my view, when he came to apply the 
  test to the facts of this case he applied too strict a test requiring a basis 
  for finding that there was &#8220;fraud or misrepresentation which caused an 
  abuse of this court&#8217;s process&#8221;. This test is reminiscent of the 
  holding in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978) that was rejected by the 
  Garofoli court. As Sopinka J. pointed out in Garofoli at p. 197, &#8220;if the 
  accused can establish, even on a prima facie basis, deliberate falsehood or 
  reckless disregard for truth&#8221;, there is no need to cross-examine.</p>
<p> [13] In my view, the appellant made out a case for cross-examination. The 
  statements in the affidavit about the utility of undercover operations and other 
  investigative techniques are conclusory and arguably understate the progress 
  of the investigation, as in this paragraph headed &#8220;UNDERCOVER OPERATORS&#8221;:</p>
<p class="indent"> Sergeant NICHOLSON and Cpl. FAIR have successfully purchased 
  contraband from Ande FULLER on 4 occasions. The buys have been useful in identifying 
  the persons associated to FULLER, the locations utilized in the Cornwall area 
  where they are making some of their deliveries, however, this investigative 
  procedure alone cannot identify the unknown conspirators, reveal details of 
  the importation scheme and distribution network, or gather sufficient evidence 
  to prosecute the individuals involved.</p>
<p> [14] In short, the appellant showed a basis for the view that the cross-examination 
  would elicit testimony tending to discredit the existence of one of the pre-conditions 
  to the authorization, namely the investigative necessity requirement. Investigative 
  necessity is a stringent requirement, requiring demonstration that there is, 
  &#8220;practically speaking, no other reasonable alternative method of investigation, 
  in the circumstances of the particular criminal inquiry&#8221;: R. v. Araujo 
  (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at para. 29. There was a basis for believing 
  that this exacting standard had not been met. The same might be said here of 
  the use of the undercover officers and police agents.</p>
<p> [15] This case bears some similarity to R. v. Lachance (1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 
  449 (S.C.C.), the companion case to Garofoli. In that case, Sopinka J. noted 
  at p. 458, that the bald assertion in the affidavit that an attempt to use an 
  undercover police officer &#8220;would be futile and not result in any further 
  evidence being obtained&#8221; was &#8220;considerably weakened&#8221; by the 
  fact that the police had an undercover informant. He suggested that cross-examination 
  could have revealed that the agent could continue his role in the investigation. 
  He therefore held that the accused should have been permitted to cross-examine 
  the affiant.</p>
<p> [16] The respondent submits that because of the unusual procedure adopted 
  in this case, the appellant, in effect, had the opportunity to cross-examine 
  the affiant and sub-affiants and therefore the trial judge&#8217;s decision 
  did not prejudice the appellant&#8217;s right to make full answer and defence. 
  As I have noted, the appellant was permitted to call five police officers involved 
  in the investigation, including the affiant. The respondent particularly relies 
  upon the ruling by the trial judge, approximately half-way through the voir 
  dire, that he would give counsel &#8220;some leeway in terms of examination 
  in-chief in all of the circumstances&#8221; because these witnesses were &#8220;not 
  really [the defence&#8217;s] witnesses&#8221;. He also said that counsel would 
  &#8220;be given some latitude in terms of your examination to permit you to 
  lead or cross-examine.&#8221;</p>
<p> [17] In my view, this ruling did little more than permit counsel to ask some 
  leading questions. It is apparent that defence counsel did not think that they 
  had the right to cross-examine on the contents of the affidavit or attempt to 
  attack the assertions in the affidavit concerning investigative necessity. Rather, 
  defence counsel continued to operate on the basis of the trial judge&#8217;s 
  earlier ruling. That ruling was made in response to an objection by Crown counsel 
  that the defence could not go into &#8220;the specific discussions relating 
  to the formulation of the affidavit itself&#8221; and could not &#8220;[go] 
  behind the affidavit that was before the authorizing judge&#8221;. At the very 
  least, it is unclear that defence counsel felt entitled to fully explore the 
  basis for the assertions in the affidavit concerning investigative necessity. 
  This is borne out in counsel&#8217;s submissions at the conclusion of the voir 
  dire where he sets out a number of areas that he would explore if permitted 
  to cross-examine.</p>
<p> [18] In my view, the trial judge erred in refusing to permit cross-examination 
  and the respondent has failed to show that no substantial wrong or miscarriage 
  of justice was occasioned by this error. </p>
<p> The other wiretap grounds of appeal</p>
<p> [19] The appellant submits that even if the trial judge did not err in refusing 
  to permit cross-examination, there was sufficient material on the record to 
  demonstrate that the authorization should be set aside. While the trial judge 
  did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court of Canada&#8217;s decision in 
  R. v. Araujo, he applied a test that resembles the test set out in that case. 
  He concluded that the investigative necessity requirement had been met. On the 
  limited record that was available I cannot say that he was in error in that 
  conclusion. However, a proper determination of that issue can only be made at 
  the new trial where the defence has the opportunity to more fully supplement 
  the record through cross-examination.</p>
<p> [20] The trial judge held that even if he was wrong and the authorization 
  should be set aside, he would not have excluded the wiretap evidence under s. 
  24(2). Not surprisingly in view of his conclusion that the authorization was 
  valid, the trial judge did not provide any reasons for his conclusion on s. 
  24(2). Again, without a complete record it is not possible to properly analyze 
  the application of s. 24(2) to this case, especially those factors going to 
  the seriousness of the violation.</p>
<p> DISPOSITION</p>
<p> [21] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the convictions and 
  order a new trial.</p>
