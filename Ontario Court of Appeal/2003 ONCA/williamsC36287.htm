<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice William J. Morrison of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated April 9, 2001 and from the sentence imposed by Justice 
  William J. Morrison dated April 9, 2001.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant was convicted of three counts of robbery following a trial 
  before a Superior Court judge sitting alone. The charges involved three bank 
  robberies, two that occurred on April 11, 2000, and one that occurred on July 
  7, 2000. </p>
<p>
  [2] In all three robberies, a large black male wearing a jean jacket, sunglasses 
  and a baseball type cap entered the bank, stood in line for a teller, and produced 
  a tattered note that said, &quot;Give me money. I have a gun&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [3] Based on the similarities between the three robberies, the trial judge ruled 
  that the evidence on each count was admissible as similar fact evidence on the 
  other counts. The appellant does not challenge that ruling on appeal.</p>
<p> [4] In convicting the appellant, the trial judge relied primarily on three 
  aspects of the evidence. First, the eyewitness evidence of a bank customer identifying 
  the appellant as the perpetrator of the July 7 robbery. Second, police evidence 
  of out-of-court statements made by the appellant's sister that she recognized 
  the appellant as the perpetrator shown in surveillance photographs of two of 
  the robberies. Third, physical evidence linking the appellant to the robberies<a name="r1"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant submits that the trial judge made two errors in relying on 
  this evidence: i) he failed to consider whether the eyewitness identification 
  evidence he relied on was contaminated as the result of flawed police procedures, 
  and ii) he accepted the police evidence of the out-of-court statements for the 
  truth of their contents in circumstance that did not permit him to do so. </p>
<p>
  [6] The Crown disputes the appellant's submissions but also contends that, if 
  we are satisfied that the trial judge erred, we should apply the proviso contained 
  in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, to uphold the convictions.</p>
<p>
  i) The Eyewitness Identification Evidence</p>
<p>
  [7] Ms. Webb was a customer at an Oakville branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia 
  on July 7, 2000. She testified that she noticed the eventual robber enter the 
  bank and made eye contact with him while standing in line because she was hot 
  and he was a wearing a jean jacket. She wrote down a description of the robber 
  immediately after the event.</p>
<p>
  [8] When police arrived on the scene, one of the officers showed Ms. Webb three 
  photographs, two that police knew were the appellant, marked &quot;Toronto Police 
  Service Mug Shot&quot;; and a third that police suspected was the appellant, 
  marked &quot;Halton Regional Police Service, Male Wanted for Robbery&quot;. 
  </p>
<p>
  [9] Ms. Webb confirmed that all three pictures depicted the Bank of Nova Scotia 
  robber.</p>
<p>
  [10] The trial judge cautioned himself strongly on the dangers of convicting 
  based on eyewitness identification evidence. Despite those cautions, with respect, 
  in our view, the trial judge made two errors relating to Ms. Webb's evidence. 
  </p>
<p> [11] First, in his reasons, the trial judge said that Ms. Webb testified that 
  the officer simply showed her the three photographs and made no suggestions 
  to her. Although that is an accurate reflection of Ms. Webb's evidence-in-chief, 
  the trial judge failed to advert to other evidence indicating that the officer 
  told Ms. Webb that police suspected the photographs depicted the robber<a name="r2"></a><a href="#2">[2]</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  [12] Second, early in his reasons, the trial judge noted that Ms. Webb identified 
  the appellant after being shown photographs that police knew, or suspected, 
  portrayed the appellant. However, the trial judge subsequently used the evidence 
  that Ms. Webb identified the appellant from the photographs immediately following 
  the robbery to bolster the reliability of her evidence without cautioning himself 
  that failing to show Ms. Webb a photo line-up was clearly improper, and may 
  have rendered her identification valueless: R. v. Smierciak, [1946] 87 C.C.C. 
  175 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 180.</p>
<p>
  [13] In our view, the cumulative effect of these two errors is substantial. 
  </p>
<p>
  ii) The Statement Evidence </p>
<p>
  [14] The trial judge made the following findings concerning the evidence of 
  Ms. Morrison's out-of-court statements: </p>
<p class="indent"> The detective testified Ms. Morrison identified her brother, 
  the accused, as the man in the four still photos. I accept the evidence of Detective 
  Wilson and Detective Leder that Ms. Morrison, on viewing these four photographs, 
  three from the Bank of Nova Scotia robbery film and the one from the CIBC robbery 
  film, (sic) that the man shown in these still photographs taken from the videos 
  of the robberies on those two days was her brother. I do not believe her evidence 
  that she said: &quot;The man only looks like my brother&quot; [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">I also accept the evidence of Detective Wilson that Ms. Morrison 
  identified the accused as her brother on the three still photos made from the 
  film at the Bank of Nova Scotia during the robbery&#133;I also accept the officer's 
  evidence that Ms. Morrison identified her brother from the photo made from the 
  CIBC film.</p>
<p> [15] The Crown concedes that it was not open to the trial judge to accept 
  the evidence concerning Ms. Morrison's out-of-court statements for the purpose 
  of proving the truth of their contents based on the principles relating to eyewitness 
  identification evidence set out in R. v. Tat (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. 
  C.A.). We agree. Leaving aside any issue concerning whether Tat creates an exception 
  to the hearsay rule<a name="r3"></a><a href="#3">[3]</a>, Ms. Morrison was not 
  an eyewitness. </p>
<p>
  [16] However, the Crown contends that it was open to the trial judge to accept 
  the evidence of Ms. Morrison's out-of-court statements for the truth of their 
  content on two alternate bases. </p>
<p>
  [17] First, the Crown points out that, while testifying at trial, Ms. Morrison 
  described her comments to the investigators as follows, &quot;I said it looked 
  like my brother. I wasn't certain if it was my brother or not.&quot; However, 
  she also testified, &quot;I'm satisfied that it looks like my brother, but I'm 
  not certain that it is my brother&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [18] The Crown submits that by rejecting Ms. Morrison's evidence that she told 
  investigating officers, &quot;the man only looks liked my brother&quot;, the 
  trial judge effectively also rejected her in-court testimony that she was not 
  certain whether the man in the photographs was her brother. Accordingly, the 
  trial judge left intact Ms. Morrison's in-court evidence, &quot;I'm satisfied 
  that it looks like my brother&quot; and must have found that she adopted the 
  officers' version of her out-of-court statement while testifying. </p>
<p>
  [19] We reject this submission. Ms. Morrison's evidence at trial was &quot;I'm 
  satisfied that it looks like my brother, but I'm not certain that it is my brother&quot;. 
  She did not say, &quot;I'm satisfied that it is my brother&quot; nor did she 
  acknowledge that that is what she told police. Moreover, the trial judge expressly 
  rejected Ms. Morrison's evidence that she told police that the man looked like 
  her brother. </p>
<p>
  [20] Assuming that it was open to the trial judge to find that Ms. Morrison 
  adopted the police version of her out-of-court statements, in our view, the 
  trial judge did not make that finding. </p>
<p>
  [21] Second, although Ms. Morrison's evidence is not eyewitness identification 
  evidence, the Crown submits that this court should adopt a rule, similar to 
  Tat, for accepting out-of-court statements of witnesses who give &quot;recognition&quot; 
  evidence relating to photographs. </p>
<p>
  [22] Again, leaving aside the question of whether Tat creates an exception to 
  the hearsay rule, we reject this submission. In our view, the admissibility 
  of the statement evidence for the truth of its content is governed by the principles 
  set out in R. v. Khan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531; R. v. Smith [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915 
  and R. v. B. (K.G.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740. No application was made to admit the 
  evidence at trial on the basis of those principles and the Crown did not ask 
  that we do so on appeal.</p>
<p>
  iii) Application of the Proviso </p>
<p>
  [23] The Crown submits that, even if we are satisfied that the trial judge erred, 
  we should apply the proviso, and uphold the convictions, for three reasons. 
  First, Ms. Webb's evidence was of some value, even though the police failed 
  to use a proper photo line-up. Second, even if we conclude that the trial judge 
  did not make a finding that Ms. Morrison adopted the police version of her out-of-court 
  statements while testifying, that finding was available on the evidence and 
  flowed from the trial judge's reasons. Third, the physical evidence linking 
  the appellant to the robberies was overwhelming.</p>
<p>
  [24] We disagree. First, on the basis of this record, if Ms. Webb's evidence 
  had any remaining value, it was minimal. </p>
<p>
  [25] Second, since the trial judge did not find that Ms. Morrison adopted the 
  police version of her out-of-court statements, it is not appropriate that we 
  make that finding on appeal. </p>
<p>
  [26] Third, it was open to the trial judge to make a finding that the physical 
  evidence was conclusive, based on either his review of the physical evidence 
  when compared to the surveillance tapes or his assessment of the cumulative 
  effect of the physical evidence in conjunction with the general description 
  evidence given by several eyewitnesses. He did not do so, nor did he make a 
  finding, based on his own observations, that the appellant was the person portrayed 
  on the surveillance tapes. </p>
<p>
  [27] We also note that, of the eleven eyewitnesses who testified at trial, six 
  were shown a proper photo line-up prior to trial. None of those eyewitnesses 
  positively identified the appellant from the photo line-up and two of them excluded 
  him. </p>
<p>
  [28] In light of the foregoing circumstances, and our own review of the physical 
  evidence, we are unable to conclude that, absent the errors made by the trial 
  judge, it was inevitable that the appellant would have been convicted.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [29] For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed, the convictions are set 
  aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>

<hr style="height: 1px; color: #000000">
<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> This evidence included a baseball type 
  cap with a diamond logo, a jean jacket, several pairs of sunglasses, and part 
  of a wig. These items were found in a car owned by the appellant&#146;s mother 
  to which the appellant had access. The July 7 eyewitness described a diamond-shaped 
  logo on the robber&#146;s cap. However, although the word &#147;Toronto&#148; 
  appeared in the logo on the cap found in the car, and the trial judge was unable 
  to determine from the video whether the same word appeared on the robber&#146;s 
  cap.</p>
<p><a name="2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a> Ms. Webb acknowledged as much in cross-examination; 
  the officer, who was testifying based on notes, gave evidence to the same effect.</p>
<p><a name="3"></a><a href="#r3">[3]</a> In Tat, Doherty J.A. states at paragraph 
  34 that &#147;the circumstances in which such statements are admitted do not 
  involve a hearsay use of the out-of-court statements&#148;. However, see R. 
  v. Starr, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, at paragraph 221. </p>
