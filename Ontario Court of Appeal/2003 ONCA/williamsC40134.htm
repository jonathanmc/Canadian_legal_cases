<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Jerome Williams, (&quot;Williams&quot;) an NBA basketball player, brought 
  an action for a declaration that he and Good Call Productions Ltd. entered into 
  a binding and enforceable settlement agreement whereby Good Call agreed to deliver 
  to Williams the final version of a Digital Video Disk (DVD) it had made of one 
  of his basketball games in exchange for payment of an additional $10,000 over 
  and above the $50,000 he had already agreed to pay. Williams then brought a 
  motion for summary judgment that Wilson J. granted. Good Call appeals on the 
  basis that the motion judge erred in holding that there were no genuine issues 
  for trial. </p>
<p>
  [2] In our opinion, the motion judge did not err in holding that there was no 
  genuine issue for trial. The e-mail sent by counsel for Good Call on November 
  15, 2002, is clear and unequivocal in its acceptance of Williams' offer to pay 
  an additional $10,000 for the DVD. Although Williams' counsel later sought to 
  impose a condition, reasonable in the circumstances, that he view the DVD and 
  that it be acceptable to him, we agree with Wilson J. that does not mean there 
  was no agreement reached on November 15, 2002.</p>
<p>
  [3] Further, there was no unacceptable conduct on the part of Williams that 
  resulted in economic duress to Good Call. On the issue of repudiation, we agree 
  with the motion judge that if one repudiates an agreement, the innocent party 
  must elect promptly to either enforce the contract, or accept the repudiation 
  and sue for damages. Good Call did not adopt either course and only alleged 
  repudiation at the motion for summary judgment. We would dismiss the appeal 
  and uphold the decision of Wilson J. </p>
<p>
  [4] Costs to the respondent fixed in the amount of $5,000, inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
