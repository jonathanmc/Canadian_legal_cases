<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is a motion to quash that part of an appeal that relies on the alleged 
  incompetency of the appellant&#8217;s counsel at trial. </p>
<p> [2] The moving parties rely on three grounds: 1) that there is, in this jurisdiction, 
  no civil case in which the incompetency of counsel has ever been accepted as 
  a basis for an appeal; 2) that an appeal on this ground represents an abuse 
  of process because the appellant signed a release and recovered a sum of money 
  for damages in the negligence action he brought against his lawyer for the same 
  incompetence; and 3) that there is manifestly no merit to the appeal relating 
  to this issue or relating to the ground that a mistrial ought to have been ordered 
  and the ground relating to the appeal from the finding there was no defamation 
  by Irene Johnson. </p>
<p> [3] We need only deal with the mistrial argument because it is, in our view, 
  decisive of whether the motion to quash part of the appeal should be granted. 
  Although counsel for the moving parties advised us that such evidence existed, 
  there was insufficient evidence from the transcript actually presented to us 
  to assist in determining whether this ground was so devoid of merit as to warrant 
  it being quashed. In the absence of such evidence, the ground relating to the 
  mistrial will be argued on the appeal. While the moving parties may well be 
  right that this ground will fail on appeal, it is also true that if it succeeds, 
  the appellant will be entitled to a new trial on all issues. Given this possibility, 
  however remote, we think the grounds of appeal are sufficiently interrelated 
  that they should not be severed and are best left to be considered by the panel 
  hearing the appeal. </p>
<p> [4] The motion to quash is therefore dismissed. Having regard to the appellant&#8217;s 
  assertion of incompetency by his trial counsel, the appellant&#8217;s former 
  counsel and his law firm should both be served by the appellant with all relevant 
  materials and given the opportunity to make written and/or oral representations 
  about the allegations made against them, if they so wish. </p>
<p> [5] The moving parties will have 75 days from the date of this order to serve 
  and file their factums. Costs of this motion will be reserved to the panel hearing 
  the appeal.</p>
