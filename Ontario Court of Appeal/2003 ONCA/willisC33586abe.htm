<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] Crown counsel has fairly conceded that the cross-examination of the appellant 
  at trial was improper in several respects and, in the result, impaired the appellant's 
  right to a fair trial. In view of this concession, counsel for the appellant 
  is not pursuing the additional grounds of appeal. We therefore make no comments 
  in respect of those grounds. </p>
<p> [2] We are of the view, however, that the Crown's concession is justified 
  on the record and that there must be a new trial. The appeal is allowed in respect 
  of the conviction for unlawfully importing a controlled substance and a new 
  trial is ordered. The convictions on the other charges to which the appellant 
  pled guilty stand. The appellant abandons her appeal against conviction and 
  sentence in respect of those offences.</p>
