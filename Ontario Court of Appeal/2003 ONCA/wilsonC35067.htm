<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice C. M. Speyer of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated February 3, 2000 and from the sentence imposed by Justice 
  Speyer on April 25, 2000.<br>
</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:<br>
</p>
<p>OVERVIEW<br>
</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted on February 3, 2000 by the Honourable Justice 
  Speyer of the offence of importing cocaine into Canada on February 18, 1999. 
  On April 25, 2000, she was sentenced to three years in prison. The appellant 
  appeals her conviction and seeks leaves to appeal her sentence. If leave is 
  granted, she submits that the three year period of incarceration should be replaced 
  by a conditional sentence.<br>
</p>
<p>FACTS<br>
</p>
<p>[2] The appellant agreed that she had travelled out of Canada to Jamaica and 
  returned on February 18, 1999. She was referred to secondary customs inspection 
  and two bottles of rum containing cocaine were found in the appellant's possession, 
  as well as a third bottle of rum which did not contain any cocaine.<br>
</p>
<p>[3] The appellant testified that shortly before she boarded the aircraft for 
  her return trip to Toronto she went to the duty free shop where she took two 
  bottles of dark rum off the shelf and brought them to the cashier's desk. She 
  then went back to obtain a bottle of white rum. The appellant then paid for 
  all three bottles, was given a receipt and told to take the bottles to the packing 
  area which was about twelve feet from the cashier's desk. <br>
</p>
<p>[4] When the appellant returned to the packing area, the two bottles of dark 
  rum were already packed in a box and the white rum was placed in the same box. 
  The bottles of dark rum which had been placed in the box contained the cocaine.<br>
</p>
<p>[5] The two bottles of the dark rum were purchased by her at the request of 
  a friend of her fianc&eacute;e in Jamaica for a man named Sugar in Toronto. 
  She did not know his last name or how to contact him. The appellant had expected 
  Sugar to meet her at the airport to pick up the two bottles of dark rum. She 
  did not know whether Sugar had come to the airport or not. The appellant denied 
  that she brought bottles of rum filled with cocaine to the airport and switched 
  them with the duty free bottles.<br>
</p>
<p>[6] The appellant also testified that the bottles of dark rum that she purchased 
  were not out of her sight for longer than thirty seconds when she was bringing 
  the bottle of white rum from the cashier's desk.<br>
</p>
<p>CONVICTION APPEAL<br>
</p>
<p>[7] The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to appreciate the significance 
  of the fingerprint evidence which showed that the appellant's fingerprints were 
  found on the bottle of white rum and on the duty-free box but not on the rum 
  bottles which contained the cocaine. She submits that the fingerprint evidence 
  supports her evidence that she had not handled the bottles of rum which contained 
  the cocaine.<br>
</p>
<p>[8] The trial judge in his reasons made specific reference to the fact that 
  the fingerprints on the bottles of dark rum did not match those of the appellant. 
  The trial judge found as a fact that the appellant put the bottles of rum containing 
  the cocaine in the box after leaving the duty free shop. Given the importance 
  of the trial judge's analysis of the evidence that led to his finding of guilt, 
  it is important to set out in some detail the trial judge's review of the evidence 
  and his findings of fact, as follows:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">After considering all of the evidence, I have concluded 
  that I do not believe the testimony of Ms. Wilson, nor am I left in a state 
  of reasonable doubt by her evidence. I find that Ms. Wilson knew that she was 
  bringing cocaine into Canada. It is the cumulative effect of many aspects of 
  Ms. Wilson's evidence that form the basis of my disbelief of her testimony. 
  For example, it is Ms. Wilson's testimony that she agreed to bring back to Toronto 
  two bottles of Appleton Rum as a favour to a person she casually met in Jamaica 
  by the name of &quot;Plumber&quot;, to be delivered to &quot;Sugar&quot;, another 
  person she barely was acquainted with. Ms. Wilson does not know the surnames 
  of either Plumber, nor Sugar. Sugar, the intended recipient, was to pick up 
  two bottles of rum at Pearson International Airport sometime around midnight 
  after Ms. Wilson's flight had arrived from Jamaica. Ms. Wilson told the Court 
  that she would never have Sugar, a person she was barely acquainted with, pick 
  up the liquor at her own residence in Toronto. Each bottle cost $8.00 American.</p>
<p class="indent">It strikes me as exceedingly unusual that a person would 
  go out to the airport at midnight merely to pick up two bottles of rum valued 
  at approximately $16.00. This area of the accused's evidence simply does not 
  have a ring of truth.</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Wilson testified that the only time the bottles 
  of Appleton Rum she purchased at the duty free shop in Montego Bay were out 
  of her sight was for the brief period it took to retrieve the third bottle of 
  white rum for packaging after the three bottles had been paid for. The distance 
  between the cashier and the packing area is about 12 feet. The theory of the 
  defence is that the male individual working in the duty shop as a packer was 
  in league with Plumber to plant the rum containing the cocaine in place of the 
  genuine bottles of rum purchased by Ms. Wilson at the duty free. Counsel for 
  Ms. Wilson contends that she was an innocent dupe. I ask myself in a drug importing 
  scheme in which Plumber, Sugar and the packaging employee in the duty free shop 
  were participants, how possibly would the duty free employee recognize Ms. Wilson 
  as the person designated by Plumber to bring the liquid cocaine back to Toronto. 
  On the evidence, I cannot see how Plumber could communicate to the packer in 
  the duty free shop that Ms. Wilson was the dupe, as Plumber had already left 
  the airport and wouldn't have been permitted within the security area in any 
  event. The point is the packer could have no way of identifying Ms. Wilson. 
  As well, it is equally difficult to envisage the timing of such a switch without 
  the accused becoming aware that it was occurring.</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Wilson states that the bottom of the box became 
  undone after leaving the duty free shop. She says that she put the roll of two 
  inch wide clear adhesive tape in her bag prior to leaving Toronto. It strikes 
  me as most unusual, although not impossible, that Ms. Wilson would conveniently 
  have a roll of two inch tape to remedy the problem with the box. It is far more 
  probable, in my view, that Ms. Wilson had the tape to affix the receipt and 
  secure the top of the box from opening as well as the bottom of the box.</p>
<p class="indent">Ms. Wilson stated that she planned her February 11th 
  trip as early as Christmas of 1998. The trip was to be an engagement celebration. 
  Nevertheless, she did not purchase her ticket until the day before her departure. 
  She purchased it in cash. The explanation that she was &quot;shopping around 
  for the best price&quot; strikes me as improbable. This was the second trip 
  to Jamaica for a single mother of five having just very modest means.</p>
<p class="indent">That portion of Ms. Wilson's evidence that she saw Sugar 
  after the events of February 18th on different occasions at fashion shows, but 
  that he alluded her when she wanted to talk to him, just simply strikes me as 
  contrived.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not one of these factors, it is the cumulative 
  effect of all of this improbable evidence which has led me to the ineluctable 
  conclusion that Ms. Wilson was not telling the truth. In arriving at this decision, 
  I have considered the fact that Ms. Wilson's fingerprints were not on the two 
  rum bottles containing the narcotic but were on the bottle of white rum which 
  did not contain the cocaine. I have taken into account the fact that the duty 
  free receipt is genuine. As previously indicated, I do not accept that the rum 
  box became insecure immediately after Ms. Wilson left the duty free shop, nor 
  do I accept that Ms. Wilson serendipitously just happened to have a large two 
  inch wide roll of adhesive tape in her carry-on baggage. I find that Ms. Wilson 
  put the contraband bottles in the rum box after leaving the duty free and sealed 
  not only the bottom of the box, but also the top and that portion of the box 
  to which the receipt was affixed. While it is true that one might expect Ms. 
  Wilson's fingerprints on the bottles containing the drugs, I am nevertheless 
  convinced on all of the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to her guilt. 
  A finding of guilt will be entered.<br>
</p>
<p>[9] While the trial judge does not express his view as to why the appellant's 
  fingerprints were not found on the bottles containing the drugs, in our opinion, 
  this does not represent any error in relation to his finding of guilt. The totality 
  of the evidence, including the appellant's own testimony, provide a reasonable 
  basis for the trial judge's conclusion. The absence of the appellant's fingerprints 
  is neither inconsistent with the trial judge's conclusion nor does it detract 
  from his ultimate finding of guilt. The appeal as to conviction is therefore 
  dismissed.<br>
</p>
<p>SENTENCE APPEAL<br>
</p>
<p>[10] The street value of the cocaine brought into the country by the appellant 
  was $112,000.00 if sold in individual grams.<br>
</p>
<p>[11] At trial, the appellant's trial counsel appeared to concede that a minimum 
  penitentiary term was necessary when he made the following submission on sentence:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">I know that in the normal course of events, this much cocaine is going to be 
  getting, on a lot of people I can see three or four years.&#133; I think that 
  it's probable that a penitentiary sentence for this quantity of cocaine is appropriate.<br>
</p>
<p>[12] In R. v. Turcotte (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 139 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 16, 
  Catzman J.A. summarized the well-established standard of appellate review of 
  sentence:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">The limitations on an appellate court in considering an appeal against sentence 
  have been stated and recently restated by the Supreme Court of Canada. The sentencing 
  judge's disposition must be &quot;not fit&quot; or &quot;clearly unreasonable&quot;: 
  R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at para. 46. It must 
  fall &quot;outside the acceptable range&quot;: Shropshire, at para. 50. In the 
  absence of &quot;an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, 
  or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only 
  intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably 
  unfit&quot;: R. v. M.(C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327, at para. 
  90. <br>
</p>
<p>[13] In R. v. Madden (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 548 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Cunningham 
  (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 542 (Ont. C.A.), this court established guidelines for 
  sentencing first offender couriers engaged in cocaine importation. Where the 
  importation involved quantities similar to that imported by the appellant, absent 
  exceptional circumstances, the recognized range of sentence is three to five 
  years.<br>
</p>
<p>[14] In R. v. Wellington (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 470 (Ont. C.A.), this court 
  again repeated its view that given the serious nature of drug importation, the 
  continued principle of general deterrence in sentencing drug couriers remains 
  a preferable option. Writing for the court, Feldman J.A. stated as follows at 
  para. 11-13:<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">In a brief endorsement after Wismayer, supra, in R. 
  v. Berbeck, [1997] O.J. No. 2434 (QL) (C.A.), which dismissed an appeal by the 
  Crown from a conditional sentence imposed at trial in a drug importing case, 
  this court stated: &quot;We are not to be taken, however, as indicating that 
  conditional sentences are ordinarily appropriate for drug importing offences. 
  See R. v. Nguyen&quot;. The court there was reconfirming its concern that although 
  conditional sentences are not prohibited for drug importation, courts must be 
  cautious in imposing conditional sentences for such offences.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">This court has made it clear that in cases involving 
  the importation of drugs into Canada, sentences must be significant in order 
  to send a message to those who would not otherwise be involved but who may be 
  tempted by the payment promised to act as a drug delivery service, that they 
  will be subject to being sentenced harshly and severely for their role. The 
  reason of course is that because it is the otherwise innocent person who will 
  raise less suspicion at the border and who is more likely to successfully import 
  the drugs, the courier role is crucial to drug dealers who do not wish to take 
  the risk themselves, and who would receive even more substantial sentences upon 
  conviction.<br>
</p>
<p class="indent">This court has not changed its policy of significant 
  sentences for importing drugs into Canada with the advent of conditional sentences.<br>
</p>
<p>[15] We are of the view that there was no error of principle in the sentencing 
  of the appellant and the sentence imposed is not demonstrably unfit. Leave to 
  appeal the sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
