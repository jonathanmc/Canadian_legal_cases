<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are not satisfied that the proposed fresh evidence satisfies the Palmer 
  threshold and the application for its introduction is therefore dismissed. </p>
<p>[2] There is no basis for interfering with the findings made by the appeal 
  judge. There was a sound evidentiary foundation for his conclusions. In particular, 
  we see no error in his endorsement of the conclusion of the trial judge that 
  the conduct was &quot;persistent and ongoing&quot;, constituted harassment, 
  and was &quot;not trifling in nature&quot;.</p>
<p>[3] The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
