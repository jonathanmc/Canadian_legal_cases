<p>On appeal from a sentence imposed by Justice Lauren E. Marshall of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice dated September 9, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The respondent pleaded guilty to fraud over $5,000 and received a conditional 
  sentence of two years less a day. The Crown appeals this sentence and asks that 
  the conditional sentence be set aside and that an appropriate custodial term 
  be imposed. </p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent was employed as the chief chiropodist for the University 
  Health Network, which is an association of three Toronto area hospitals. Between 
  1996 and 2000, he submitted hundreds of false invoices to his employer, thereby 
  defrauding the hospital system of approximately $900,000. In some cases the 
  invoices were inflated, in others they were for non-existent work, and in other 
  cases they were for personal expenses. Each invoice was approved by the respondent 
  and submitted to the University Health Network for payment. In many cases the 
  respondent acted in concert with third parties.</p>
<p>
  [3] In March 2000, acting on an anonymous tip, the University Health Network 
  conducted an internal audit of the chiropody unit. As a result of this audit, 
  the respondent's criminal activities were discovered and the police were contacted. 
  The respondent was charged with fraud in February of 2001. A year later, he 
  gave a detailed statement to the police admitting his involvement in the fraud.</p>
<p>
  [4] We accept the Crown's submissions that (1) the trial judge over-emphasized 
  the significance of the respondent's guilty plea; and (2) that a conditional 
  sentence is demonstrably unfit in this case for three reasons: (i) it is outside 
  the range of sentence recently approved by this court (we refer to R. v. Bogart 
  (2002), 167 C.C.C. (3d) 390 (Ont. C.A.) (leave to appeal to the Supreme Court 
  of Canada denied March 20, 2003) and the decisions reviewed in it); (ii) it 
  fails to satisfy the principle of general deterrence; and (iii) it is disproportionate 
  to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's degree of responsibility.</p>
<p>
  [5] In Bogart, the facts of which are, in many important respects, strikingly 
  similar to those of this case, Laskin J.A. on behalf of the court affirmed the 
  principle that cases of large scale fraud by persons in a position of trust 
  have generally resulted in substantial sentences of imprisonment. At pages 399-400 
  he said:</p>
<p class="indent"> Both before and after Parliament's introduction of conditional 
  sentences, cases of large-scale fraud by persons in a position of trust have 
  typically resulted in substantial jail sentences. In his recent judgment in 
  R. v. Dobis (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 536, 163 C.C.C. (3d) 259 (C.A.), my colleague 
  MacPherson J.A. has thoroughly reviewed these cases. His review shows that ordinarily 
  these frauds merit a penitentiary sentence in the range of three to five years. 
  Even where mitigating considerations have reduced the sentence to the reformatory 
  range, a jail term, not a sentence served in the community, has usually been 
  imposed.</p>
<p class="indent"> Health care professionals who defraud provincial health care 
  plans have also normally received a jail sentence. As this court said in R. 
  v. McCrystal (1992), 55 O.A.C. 167 at 169, where a doctor defrauded OHIP of 
  nearly $85,000 by submitting false claims for fees, &quot;[i]t is well-established 
  that, in the absence of special circumstances, a custodial term should be imposed 
  for an offence of this nature.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent"> Special circumstances that might justify a conditional sentence 
  for OHIP fraud include circumstances where the amount of the fraud is relatively 
  small, the doctor has made full restitution before sentencing or the doctor 
  can point to exceptional personal circumstances such as ill health or advanced 
  age. None of these special circumstances exists here.</p>
<p>
  [6] Neither do special circumstances exist in the case before us.</p>
<p>
  [7] The sentence imposed in this case fails to satisfy the fundamental principles 
  of sentencing particularly in light of factors relating to the seriousness of 
  the offence and the respondent's moral blameworthiness:</p>
<p>
  Seriousness of the Offence</p>
<p>
  [8] Fraud over $5,000 is a serious offence attracting a maximum penalty of ten 
  years in prison. The quantum of the fraud in this case, was, as indicated, around 
  $900,000. The fraud was systematic and well planned, taking place over four 
  years and involving several participants. Were it not for the anonymous tip 
  received by the University Health Network, it might never have been discovered. 
  As a result of the fraud, the University Health Network suffered substantial 
  losses most of which were unrecovered (the civil settlement with the respondent 
  resulted in the recovery of only $150,000, a small portion of the loss). The 
  respondent also returned computer equipment for which he had arranged for the 
  University Health Network to be invoiced and which he had used at his home for 
  his personal use. Further, the general public was deprived of resources that 
  could have been put toward important medical services.</p>
<p>
  The Respondent's Moral Blameworthiness</p>
<p>
  [9] This was an extremely serious breach of trust. The respondent was entrusted 
  with the administration of the chiropody department at Toronto's largest hospital, 
  a trust he repeatedly violated over an extended period of time. The respondent 
  was motivated by greed. He used his share of the proceeds of his crime to purchase 
  expensive merchandise and services, including a week long trip to Whistler, 
  British Columbia for himself and his family. The respondent cooperated with 
  the police and hospital officials only after an audit revealed his fraudulent 
  activities. Although the respondent has made some restitution, the majority 
  of the public funds he misappropriated have not yet been recovered. The respondent 
  enlisted the help of his teenage son and two of his son's friends to commit 
  some of the fraudulent acts. This was not only a breach of trust with respect 
  to his employer, but a grave breach of his responsibility as a parent.</p>
<p>
  [10] In the result, the appeal is allowed, the sentence is set aside and in 
  its place, we impose a sentence of eighteen months imprisonment. A warrant may 
  issue to be exercised in the discretion of the Crown.</p>
