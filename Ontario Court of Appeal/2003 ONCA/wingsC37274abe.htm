<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<P>[1] The appellant concedes that $22,987.50 is owed to the respondent. It has 
  also not appealed the dismissal of its counterclaim. <br>
</p>
<P>[2] While we agree that there appeared to be no evidence to contradict a finding 
  that a certified cheque was tendered, this does not undermine the conclusion, 
  as asserted in paragraph 17 of the Statement of Claim, that the full amount 
  was owing based on the invoices. <br>
</p>
<P>[3] We therefore see no basis for interfering in the result at trial. The appellant 
  abandons its appeal as to costs.<br>
</p>
<P>[4] The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $7,500 
  in total.</p>
