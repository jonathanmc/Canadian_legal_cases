<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice Harry LaForme of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on March 20, 1998.</p>
<p>CRONK J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] The appellant was charged on a fifteen count indictment with two counts 
  of first degree murder, four counts of attempted murder, two counts of robbery, 
  and one count each of the offences of discharging a firearm with intent to endanger 
  life, forcible seizure, unlawful use of a firearm, possession of a restricted 
  weapon, wearing a disguise, possession of stolen property, and possession of 
  a prohibited weapon. Following a trial by judge and jury, he was convicted on 
  all counts. The convictions on the charges of discharging a firearm with intent 
  to endanger life, forcible seizure, wearing a disguise, and possession of stolen 
  property were stayed on the basis of R. v. Kienapple, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. </p>
<p>[2] The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment with no parole eligibility 
  for twenty-five years. He appeals from his convictions.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant was tried jointly with a co-accused, Roshan Norouzali, who 
  was also convicted of two counts of first degree murder and numerous other offences. 
  Norouzali also appeals from his convictions. The two appeals were heard together 
  and reasons for judgment in both appeals are being released contemporaneously.</p>
<p>I. OVERVIEW </p>
<p>
  [4] All charges against the appellant stem from two incidents on September 14, 
  1994. Ken Thomas was killed and his car was stolen on that day. He was shot 
  four times with a .22 calibre rifle, once in the back of the neck and three 
  times through the left side of his head. His body was discovered approximately 
  four months later, on January 21, 1995, inside a perimeter fence at the Pickering 
  Nuclear Generating Station.</p>
<p>[5] It was the Crown&#146;s theory at trial that the appellant and Norouzali 
  murdered Thomas and then used the victim&#146;s car that same day to rob Gagnon 
  Sporting Goods Store (&#147;Gagnons&#148;), a hunting and fishing supply store 
  in Oshawa. The robbery of Gagnons was carried out by two masked men. During 
  the course of the robbery, one of the perpetrators fired six shots from the 
  same .22 calibre gun that had been used to kill Thomas, killing one person and 
  wounding three others. The second perpetrator smashed a display case and took 
  eleven handguns, including a Colt .45 calibre firearm (the &#147;Colt&#148;) 
  and a Ruger model .45 calibre handgun (the &#147;Ruger&#148;). No money was 
  stolen.</p>
<p>[6] The appellant, Norouzali, and a third person, Deryck Thompson, were arrested 
  six months later, on March 10, 1995, after robbing a grocery store in St. Thomas 
  (the &#147;St. Thomas robbery&#148;). On their arrest, Norouzali and Thompson 
  were armed, respectively, with the Colt and the Ruger stolen from Gagnons. The 
  appellant was armed with a .38 calibre handgun. That gun was not linked to Gagnons. 
  The appellant discharged the .38 calibre handgun during the St. Thomas robbery, 
  shooting a customer in the leg. Prior to the trial at issue on this appeal, 
  the appellant, Norouzali and Thompson all pleaded guilty to and were convicted 
  of the St. Thomas robbery and various other charges arising from it.</p>
<p>[7] When booked at the police station following his arrest in connection with 
  the St. Thomas robbery, the appellant described his height as 5&#146;6&#148; 
  and his weight as 150 pounds. He has brown hair and is balding. Norouzali is 
  5&#146;9&#148; tall and, at the time of booking, weighed 165 pounds. He speaks 
  with a Persian accent. Thompson, a white male, is 5&#146;7&#148; tall and, at 
  the time of booking, weighed 165 pounds.</p>
<p>[8] At the trial at issue on this appeal, the trial judge admitted alleged 
  similar fact evidence concerning the St. Thomas robbery and four additional 
  robberies in London carried out between September 19 and December 22, 1994 (collectively, 
  the &#147;London robberies&#148;). </p>
<p>[9] The Crown&#146;s theory was that this evidence tended to prove the identity 
  of the appellant and Norouzali as the perpetrators of the Gagnons robbery and 
  of the appellant as the shooter during that incident. As the same gun that was 
  used to kill Thomas was used by the shooter at Gagnons, proof of the identity 
  of the perpetrators of the robbery and shootings at Gagnons would connect those 
  persons to Thomas&#146; murder.</p>
<p>[10] The appellant and Norouzali did not testify at trial. Thompson was called 
  as a witness for the Crown.</p>
<p>[11] In support of his appeal, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred: 
  (a) in admitting the alleged similar fact evidence at trial; (b) in reversing, 
  near the end of the Crown&#146;s case, his earlier ruling following the voir 
  dire that evidence establishing that the appellant shot someone during the St. 
  Thomas robbery was inadmissible; (c) in his instruction to the jury on the doctrine 
  of recent possession; and (d) in his instruction to the jury on reasonable doubt. 
  The appellant does not challenge the trial judge&#146;s instruction to the jury 
  concerning the alleged similar fact evidence; nor does he assert that his convictions 
  were unreasonable.</p>
<p>[12] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the trial judge erred in 
  admitting two of the incidents of alleged similar fact evidence at issue on 
  this appeal. Accordingly, on that ground, I would allow the appeal, set aside 
  the convictions and order a new trial.</p>
<p>II. FACTS</p>
<p>
  A. The Murder of Ken Thomas</p>
<p>
  [13] Ken Thomas was last seen alive on the morning of September 14, 1994. When 
  his body was discovered on January 21, 1995, it was determined that he had been 
  shot four times in the head with a .22 calibre rifle. Expert evidence at trial 
  established that Thomas had been executed at the site where his body was found.</p>
<p>[14] Thomas owned a 1989 Chevrolet Caprice automobile prior to his disappearance. 
  His car was seen parked at Gagnons at about 2:00 p.m. on the day of the Gagnons 
  robbery. It was used as the getaway car for that robbery and was recovered later, 
  a short distance from the store. </p>
<p>B. The Robbery and Shootings at Gagnons</p>
<p>
  [15] Two men wearing masks or balaclavas entered Gagnons through the front door 
  shortly after 5:00 p.m. on September 14, 1994. One of the men was carrying a 
  .22 calibre rifle. As he entered the store, he yelled: &#147;Okay, this is it. 
  This is a hold-up. Everybody get down.&#148; An employee who did not respond 
  to the robber&#146;s liking was shot in the arm. The sound was muffled by a 
  silencer, as were the subsequent gunshots. The owner of the store, who was on 
  the telephone behind a counter when the assailants entered, told the person 
  on the telephone that a robbery was occurring. The gunman yelled, &#147;I told 
  you to get down and I&#146;m not fuckin&#146; kidding&#148;, and then shot the 
  owner twice, once in the shoulder and then in the temple. The owner died from 
  his wounds approximately forty minutes later. Two other persons, who made no 
  attempts to resist the robbers, were also shot. </p>
<p>[16] Six shots were fired in total by the same gunman. Six .22 calibre shell 
  casings of Winchester manufacture and five spent bullets were found at the scene. 
  The four victims were all shot with the same .22 calibre firearm, which had 
  previously been used to kill Thomas. </p>
<p>[17] The second assailant smashed a display case containing handguns. He kicked 
  one of the injured victims out of the way to reach the case, and yelled, &#147;Everybody 
  get down. If anybody moves, kill them.&#148; He then took eleven semi-automatic 
  handguns, including the Colt and the Ruger, and put them in a duffel bag. </p>
<p>[18] No money was taken although it was available, no attempt was made to remove 
  cash from the premises, and no one was robbed of valuables. The entire incident 
  took ninety seconds or less. </p>
<p>[19] Although various descriptions of the two robbers were given by several 
  witnesses, no one could identify the appellant or Norouzali. Descriptions of 
  the height of the shooter ranged from 5&#146;4&#148; to 5&#146;9&#148;. He was 
  said to have a thick build and a deep voice, and to be shorter and stockier 
  than the other assailant. The second robber was described as slightly taller 
  and slimmer than the shooter.</p>
<p>[20] Other witnesses, who saw the two men leaving Gagnons, also gave varying 
  descriptions of them at trial. One witness said that both men were 5&#146;10&#148; 
  in height and well-built, weighing approximately 200 pounds each. The driver 
  of the getaway car was described as clean-shaven and white. Another witness 
  described the driver as about 5&#146;7&#148; to 5&#146;8&#148; in height and 
  stockier in build than the passenger. Two other witnesses described the driver 
  as dark, with some greying facial hair.</p>
<p>[21] Ken Thomas&#146; car, later identified as the getaway car, was retrieved 
  the day after the robbery about one kilometre from Gagnons. Blood found in the 
  vehicle was later matched by DNA analysis to blood found in the shattered display 
  case and to blood found on pants belonging to Norouzali, which were seized upon 
  his arrest on March 10, 1995. </p>
<p>[22] The Crown asserted that the appellant was the shorter and heavier robber 
  at Gagnons, that he was in command or control of that robbery, and that he was 
  the shooter. On the Crown&#146;s theory, based in significant part on the DNA 
  evidence, Norouzali was the second, taller and slimmer robber. No forensic evidence 
  linked the appellant to Gagnons or to Thomas&#146; car. He was seen with Norouzali 
  in London, however, early in the morning of September 15, 1994, less than sixteen 
  hours after the robbery at Gagnons. </p>
<p>C. The Alleged Similar Fact Evidence</p>
<p>
  [23] The similar fact evidence tendered by the Crown was essentially unchallenged 
  for the purpose of the voir dire. It may be summarized as follows. </p>
<p>(1) The First London Robbery: September 19, 1994 </p>
<p>
  [24] During the morning of September 19, 1994, a masked assailant entered a 
  Bank of Nova Scotia branch in London shortly before it opened to the public 
  for the day (the &#147;First London robbery&#148;). He gained entry by smashing 
  the glass front door with a brick. He was carrying a .45 calibre handgun, wrapped 
  in a towel, in his left hand. As the bank employees moved towards an exit at 
  the back of the bank, the assailant fired a shot. No one was injured and no 
  money was stolen. </p>
<p>[25] Expert evidence indicated that the Ruger stolen from Gagnons was eliminated 
  as the firearm discharged at this bank. The Colt stolen from Gagnons, however, 
  could neither be eliminated nor linked to this incident. A bullet recovered 
  at the scene was later determined to be .45 calibre &#147;reloaded&#148; ammunition.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>[26] According to witnesses, the assailant appeared to be a black, bearded 
  male who was wearing a red baseball cap. His height was said to range from 5&#146;6&#148; 
  to 5&#146;9&#148;. One witness suggested that the assailant was about 5&#146;0&#148; 
  tall. </p>
<p>[27] After the incident, a bank employee saw a car with one passenger and a 
  driver speeding from the scene. The passenger appeared to be the person who 
  had entered the bank. A passer-by also observed a man get into a white vehicle. 
  She described him as about 5&#146;6&#148; tall, wearing a handkerchief over 
  his face.</p>
<p>[28] The getaway vehicle had been stolen on September 18, 1994. It was recovered 
  a short distance from the bank. The car thief was described by a witness as 
  a thin male, wearing a baseball cap, with long, shoulder-length hair.</p>
<p>(2) The Second London Robbery: November 11, 1994 </p>
<p>
  [29] At approximately 9:10 p.m., shortly after closing time, two men entered 
  Valdi&#146;s grocery store in London by firing two gunshots at the front glass 
  door (the &#147;Second London robbery&#148;). Both men were armed and were wearing 
  blue jeans and balaclavas or ski masks. Witnesses described them both as &#147;about 
  25&#148; years of age.</p>
<p>[30] The first robber was described by witnesses as 5&#146;6&#148; to 5&#146;7&#148; 
  tall, wearing a red balaclava or ski mask, and having dark, black eyes and white 
  coloured skin. Another witness suggested that he was 5&#146;7&#148; to 5&#146;9&#148; 
  tall. Witnesses described the second man as 5&#146;10&#148; tall and huskier 
  in build than the first man. The second man was wearing a black balaclava and 
  was carrying a black bag.</p>
<p>[31] On entering the store, both men rushed into the office area. The first, 
  shorter man, demanded money from the cash trays and the safe. His voice was 
  said to be low and gruff, giving the appearance of being forced. He had no accent. 
  He was described by witnesses as being in charge of the robbery. The second 
  man did not speak while he was in the store. Approximately $1,000 was taken 
  in this robbery. </p>
<p>[32] Two spent .45 calibre cartridge shells of Winchester manufacture were 
  recovered at the scene, together with two .45 calibre bullets. Two of the cartridges 
  and one of the bullets were later determined to be from the Ruger stolen from 
  Gagnons. The bullets were reloaded ammunition.</p>
<p>[33] An off-duty police officer saw a man wearing dark coloured clothing and 
  carrying a dark duffel bag running from the store. He was seen to be removing 
  a ski mask and was described as 5&#146;8&#148; to 5&#146;9&#148; in height and 
  approximately 180 pounds in weight, with a stocky or sturdy build. A second 
  person was observed by the police officer standing by a vehicle in the store&#146;s 
  parking lot. The car was later determined to be stolen. When the two men entered 
  the vehicle, the police officer pursued it. He noted that the driver was Caucasian 
  or European with &#147;maybe a little bit olive [complexion]&#148; and dark 
  hair. </p>
<p>(3) The Third London Robbery: November 24, 1994 </p>
<p>
  [34] In the mid-afternoon of November 24, 1994, two armed men wearing balaclavas 
  entered the front door of a Toronto-Dominion Bank branch in London (the &#147;Third 
  London robbery&#148;). They arrived about fifteen to twenty minutes after a 
  Brinks truck made a delivery of money to the bank and shortly before a second 
  Brinks truck was scheduled to pick-up the money.</p>
<p>[35] The first robber ordered the people in the bank to the floor. He then 
  fired a single shot from a gun in the direction of a bank employee. Thereafter, 
  he entered the bank vault and said: &#147;This is a Brinks pick-up. I want in 
  this fucking compartment right now. Open it up. I want you to open it up right 
  now.&#148; He was described by witnesses as wearing a dark or black ski mask 
  and knit toque on his head. Descriptions of his height ranged from 5&#146;6&#148; 
  to 5&#146;7&#148; or 5&#146;8&#148;. He was said to have a slight or small build 
  and to weigh approximately 150 to 170 pounds. He had no accent. Witnesses said 
  that he acted aggressively and authoritatively. He gave bank employees thirty 
  seconds to open the bank vault. </p>
<p>[36] The second robber attempted to take money from the tellers&#146; wickets. 
  He was also wearing a ski mask and toque. He was described as taller and heavier 
  than the first robber. He was said to be about 5&#146;10&#148; to 6&#146;0&#148; 
  tall, weighing about 170 pounds. One witness described the second robber as 
  5&#146;7&#148; to 5&#146;8&#148; tall. He was also said to have a &#147;distinct 
  accent&#148;, speaking in broken English.</p>
<p>[37] Both men were armed with .45 calibre firearms. Both men fired two shots 
  from their weapons. No one was injured. Four cartridge cases and a number of 
  bullet fragments were recovered from the scene. Two of the cartridge cases were 
  later matched to the Ruger stolen from Gagnons. One of the bullets was matched 
  to the Colt stolen from Gagnons. Reloaded ammunition was used by the robbers. 
</p>
<p>[38] The assailants left the bank when the bank employees could not open the 
  safe. They made good their escape in a light coloured or grey car which was 
  stolen on November 13, 1994. </p>
<p>(4) The Fourth London Robbery: December 22, 1994 </p>
<p>
  [39] During the early afternoon of December 22, 1994, two armed, hooded men 
  entered a National Grocers store in London through the front door (the &#147;Fourth 
  London robbery&#148;). The first assailant ordered all of the store employees 
  to the floor. He approached a cashier and demanded that the money from the cash 
  register be placed in a flight bag which he had with him. He took approximately 
  $7,000 to $8,000. He then ordered the cashier to the floor. He was described 
  by the cashier as having olive-coloured skin and wearing new, dark blue jeans 
  and a dark grey sweatshirt with the hood pulled up. He was said to be between 
  5&#146;8&#148; and 5&#146;10&#148; tall. He had a stocky build and was described 
  as weighing approximately 150 pounds. He was also said to have a slight Jamaican 
  or Trinidadian accent. </p>
<p>[40] The second assailant was described by witnesses as slightly shorter than 
  the first assailant, and not as heavy. He was said to be white and wearing a 
  dark sweatshirt or jacket, with a hood covering his head. He went to a second 
  cash register to remove cash from the till. </p>
<p>[41] No gunshots were fired during this robbery; however, ten unfired rounds 
  of .45 calibre ammunition were recovered in an airline flight bag left at the 
  scene. Expert evidence established that three of the cartridges had been reloaded 
  on a reloading press owned by Thompson and his brother.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  The press was later seized from Thompson&#146;s brother&#146;s residence.</p>
<p>[42] The assailants fled from the scene in a motor vehicle which was stolen 
  on December 20, 1994. </p>
<p>(5) The St. Thomas Robbery: March 10, 1995 </p>
<p>
  [43] Shortly before 4:00 p.m. on March 10, 1995, the appellant, Norouzali and 
  Thompson entered a National Grocers store in St. Thomas. The appellant was armed 
  with a .38 calibre revolver. Norouzali was armed with a .45 calibre Colt semi-automatic 
  weapon and Thompson was armed with a .45 calibre Ruger semi-automatic firearm. 
  The weapons carried by Norouzali and Thompson were later matched to the Colt 
  and the Ruger stolen from Gagnons. The appellant&#146;s .38 calibre revolver 
  could not be linked to Gagnons or any of the London robberies. </p>
<p>[44] All three men were wearing dark ski masks or balaclavas and gloves. The 
  appellant ordered all of the persons in the store to the floor, stating: &#147;This 
  is a robbery. Everyone down on the floor.&#148; The other perpetrators issued 
  similar commands. The appellant shot a store customer in the leg. </p>
<p>[45] The appellant demanded to know the identity of the store manager. When 
  the manager was identified, the appellant ordered him to the store safe and 
  said: &#147;Open the fucking safe. You&#146;ve got 30 seconds or I&#146;ll shoot.&#148; 
  The appellant removed $13,500 in cash and a series of cheques totalling $46,000 
  from the safe. The three men then fled. The entire incident lasted about three 
  or four minutes.</p>
<p>[46] Throughout, one of the three robbers stood guard at the door and did not 
  actively engage in the events inside the store. Thompson claimed to have played 
  that role.</p>
<p>[47] The three men were arrested while they were fleeing from the scene in 
  a van which had been stolen by them two days earlier in Toronto. The appellant 
  was driving the vehicle. Norouzali was in the front passenger seat and Thompson 
  was in the rear of the car. </p>
<p>[48] When the appellant was removed from the vehicle, he told a police officer 
  that there were three guns in the car. He said: &#147;I have a .38. They have 
  .45s.&#148; The appellant also admitted to the police officer that he had fired 
  a shot during the robbery.</p>
<p>[49] Subsequently, two baseball caps and a balaclava were seized from the area 
  outside the van and the police executed various search warrants, seizing an 
  array of items from different locations, including a box of .45 calibre ammunition 
  and a bag which contained balaclavas from Norouzali&#146;s car and a reloading 
  device from Thompson&#146;s brother&#146;s residence. During their searches 
  of Thompson&#146;s residence, the police seized three handguns including a .22 
  calibre handgun, an assortment of ammunition including .38 calibre bullets, 
  a supply of .22 calibre rifle ammunition of Winchester manufacture (the same 
  type of ammunition recovered at Gagnons), a supply of hollow point bullets, 
  a marksmanship certificate, and a device used to speed the loading of bullets 
  into a gun. The items seized from Thompson were in his possession lawfully pursuant 
  to firearms acquisition certificates held by him.</p>
<p>[50] The appellant pleaded guilty in June 1995 to a series of charges arising 
  from the St. Thomas robbery, including aggravated assault, possession of a prohibited 
  firearm, robbery, and wearing a mask with intent to commit an indictable offence.</p>
<p>(6) Thompson&#146;s Evidence on the Voir Dire</p>
<p>
  [51] For the purpose of the voir dire concerning the admissibility of the similar 
  fact evidence, the Crown also relied on Thompson&#146;s evidence at the preliminary 
  inquiry held in this case.</p>
<p>[52] Thompson is a childhood friend of the appellant. He has a lengthy criminal 
  record dating from 1969, with some crime free years. His record includes convictions 
  for obstructing justice and various charges of theft and breaking and entering. 
  He had not been convicted of armed robbery prior to the St. Thomas robbery. 
  Thompson is an avid hunter, sportsman, gun enthusiast, and a competitive marksman. 
  Prior to March 1995, he owned a large collection of guns and an assortment of 
  ammunition, which he used regularly in competitive shooting and at a gun club. 
  As I earlier mentioned, those items were in his possession lawfully.</p>
<p>[53] During his testimony at the preliminary inquiry, Thompson denied any involvement 
  in Thomas&#146; killing, the robbery and shootings at Gagnons, and the London 
  robberies. He admitted his participation in the St. Thomas robbery and his convictions 
  on offences arising out of that robbery. He also testified that: </p>
<p class="indent">(i) prior to the St. Thomas robbery, he gave the appellant .45 
  and .357 calibre ammunition from time to time. He did not think that he had 
  provided the appellant with .22 calibre ammunition. The appellant&#146;s common-law 
  spouse made jewellery from gun ammunition;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) Thompson conceived the idea of robbing the National Grocers 
  store in London. He approached the appellant with his plan. He claimed that 
  he met Norouzali in December 1994 or January 1995 but that he did not know him 
  well. Thompson said that Norouzali spoke English with difficulty;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) several days prior to the St. Thomas robbery, the appellant 
  told Thompson that he (the appellant) could purchase or get guns for the robbery;</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) shortly before the St. Thomas robbery, Thompson accompanied 
  the appellant and Norouzali to a countryside location, allegedly previously 
  unknown to Thompson. The appellant or Norouzali, or both, went into the woods 
  and returned with a bag containing three guns. Thompson obtained the Ruger from 
  the bag for use in the St. Thomas robbery. He also obtained a balaclava from 
  the appellant or Norouzali, or both; and</p>
<p class="indent">(v) the appellant drove the getaway car following the St. Thomas 
  robbery.</p>
<p>D. The Trial Judge&#146;s Rulings on the Admissibility of the Similar Fact 
  Evidence</p>
<p>
  [54] The trial judge made three rulings on the alleged similar fact evidence. 
  On February 2, 1998, he ruled that the evidence proffered by the Crown on the 
  voir dire concerning the London and St. Thomas robberies, outlined above, was 
  admissible (the &#147;first ruling&#148;). </p>
<p>[55] Thereafter, following further submissions from the parties, the trial 
  judge ruled on February 6, 1998 that evidence indicating that the appellant 
  shot someone during the St. Thomas robbery was inadmissible. The Crown was permitted, 
  however, to lead evidence that the appellant discharged a firearm during that 
  robbery (the &#147;second ruling&#148;). </p>
<p>[56] Finally, towards the end of the Crown&#146;s case, the Crown requested 
  that the trial judge reconsider aspects of his first and second rulings. In 
  particular, as relevant on this appeal, the Crown requested that the trial judge 
  reconsider his second ruling excluding the evidence that the appellant shot 
  someone during the St. Thomas robbery. On March 5, 1998, the trial judge reversed 
  his second ruling, holding that the Crown was permitted to lead evidence that 
  the appellant had shot someone during the St. Thomas robbery (the &#147;third 
  ruling&#148;). </p>
<p>[57] The appellant challenges the first and third rulings of the trial judge 
  concerning the similar fact evidence. Norouzali does not raise either of the 
  rulings as grounds for his appeal. As appears from the facts which I have set 
  out, the Crown&#146;s case against Norouzali was different than its case against 
  the appellant: it included DNA evidence identifying Norouzali as the second 
  robber at Gagnons who stole the guns from a display case, thereby eliminating 
  him as the shooter in that robbery.</p>
<p>E. The Theory of an Alternate Suspect</p>
<p>
  [58] It was the defence theory that an alternate suspect, Thompson, was more 
  likely than not to be the Gagnons shooter rather than the appellant. That theory 
  emerged in the defence cross-examinations at trial of the Crown&#146;s witnesses.</p>
<p>[59] Thompson had a corroborated alibi for the Third London robbery (November 
  24, 1994). Moreover, he testified at trial that he was with the appellant at 
  a hospital visiting a dying friend on the day of the Second London robbery (November 
  11, 1994), thus potentially providing an alibi for himself and the appellant 
  concerning that robbery. Thompson had no alibi, however, and was uncertain of 
  his whereabouts, on the days of the Gagnons incident (September 14, 1994), the 
  First London robbery (September 19, 1994), and the Fourth London robbery (December 
  22, 1994).</p>
<p>[60] One of the employees of Gagnons who was present in that store during the 
  robbery knew Thompson from fishing tournaments. He testified at trial that he 
  knew Thompson&#146;s height and voice and that he did not recognize the voice 
  of the Gagnons shooter, thereby suggesting that Thompson was not the shooter. 
  He also said that Thompson had been in Gagnons before September 14, 1994. Thompson 
  denied that. </p>
<p>[61] Thompson was a police suspect during the investigation of the offences 
  relevant to this appeal. In his jury charge, the trial judge instructed the 
  jury to be cautious in accepting Thompson&#146;s testimony and to search for 
  other confirmatory evidence before relying on his evidence alone. The adequacy 
  and propriety of those instructions are not challenged on this appeal. Indeed, 
  Crown counsel concedes that Thompson&#146;s evidence required very careful scrutiny.</p>
<p>III. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  A. The Admissibility of the Similar Fact Evidence</p>
<p>
  (1) The General Evidentiary Rules</p>
<p>
  [62] The inadmissibility of general propensity or disposition evidence in a 
  criminal trial has long been established under Canadian law. The general exclusionary 
  rule recognizes that such evidence, although potentially relevant to the ultimate 
  issue of guilt or innocence, poses grave dangers to a fair trial: see R. v. 
  D.(L.E.), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 111; R. v. Shearing (2002), 165 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (S.C.C.) 
  and R. v. Handy (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.). In the latter case, Binnie 
  J. referred at para. 37 to the great potential of such evidence &#147;for prejudice, 
  distraction and time consumption&#148; and said, &#147;It ought, in general, 
  to form no part of the case which the accused is called on to answer. It is 
  excluded notwithstanding the general rule that all relevant evidence is admissible 
  [citations omitted].&#148; The serious potential prejudice to the accused arising 
  from the admission of general propensity evidence encompasses both moral prejudice, 
  that is, the stigma of &#147;bad personhood&#148;, and reasoning prejudice, 
  which includes potential confusion and distraction of the jury from the actual 
  charge or charges against the accused: Handy at para. 100, per Binnie J. and 
  Shearing, at pp. 249-50, per Binnie J.</p>
<p>[63] Nonetheless, evidence showing a specific propensity is admissible upon 
  demonstration that the probative value of the proposed evidence outweighs its 
  prejudicial effect. In Handy, Binnie J. stated at paras. 41 and 48: </p>
<p class="indent"> While emphasizing the general rule of exclusion, courts have recognized that 
  an issue may arise in the trial of the offence charged to which evidence of 
  previous misconduct may be so highly relevant and cogent that its probative 
  value in the search for truth outweighs any potential for misuse [citation omitted].</p>
<p class="center">&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent"> Canadian case law recognizes that as the &#147;similar facts&#148; 
  become more focused and specific to circumstances similar to the charge (i.e., 
  more situation specific), the probative value of propensity, thus circumscribed, 
  becomes more cogent. As the differences and variables that distinguish the earlier 
  &#147;similar facts&#148; from the subject matter of the charge in this type 
  of case are reduced, the cogency of the desired inferences is thought to increase. 
  Ultimately the policy premise of the general exclusionary rule (prejudice exceeds 
  probative value) ceases to be true.</p>
<p>(2) The Test for the Admission of Similar Fact Evidence</p>
<p>
  [64] In cases where, as here, similar fact evidence is relied upon by the Crown 
  to prove identity, the tendered evidence must tend to demonstrate some striking 
  or high degree of similarity between the alleged similar acts and the charged 
  act(s). This standard of &#147;striking similarity&#148; may be met by the Crown 
  upon proof of a unique trademark or signature, or by the combined effect of 
  a number of significant similarities common to the similar acts and the charged 
  act(s). In elaborating upon this standard in R. v. Arp (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 
  321 (S.C.C.), Cory J. said at p. 342: </p>
<p class="indent">[A] principled approach to the admission of similar fact evidence will in all 
  cases rest on the finding that the accused&#146;s involvement in the alleged 
  similar acts or counts is unlikely to be the product of coincidence. This conclusion 
  ensures that the evidence has sufficient probative force to be admitted, and 
  will involve different considerations in different contexts. Where, as here, 
  similar fact evidence is adduced on the issue of identity, there must be a high 
  degree of similarity between the acts for the evidence to be admitted. For example, 
  a unique trade mark or signature will automatically render the alleged acts 
  &#147;strikingly similar&#148; and therefore highly probative and admissible. 
  In the same way, a number of significant similarities, taken together, may be 
  such that by their cumulative effect, they warrant admission of the evidence. 
  Where identity is at issue ordinarily, the trial judge should review the manner 
  in which the similar acts were committed &#150; that is to say, whether the 
  similar acts involve a unique trade mark or reveal a number of significant similarities. 
  This review will enable him or her to decide whether the alleged similar acts 
  were all committed by the same person. This preliminary determination establishes 
  the objective improbability that the accused&#146;s involvement in the alleged 
  acts is the product of coincidence and thereby gives the evidence the requisite 
  probative force. Thus, where the similar fact evidence is adduced to prove identity, 
  once this preliminary determination is made, the evidence related to the similar 
  act (or count, in a multi-count indictment) may be admitted to prove the commission 
  of another act (or count) [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[65] Justice Cory also provided suggestions for trial judges to consider in 
  deciding upon the admissibility of similar fact evidence where the evidence 
  is adduced to prove identity (at p. 345): </p>
<p class="indent">(1) Generally where similar fact evidence is adduced to prove 
  identity a high degree of similarity between the acts is required in order to 
  ensure that the similar fact evidence has the requisite probative value of outweighing 
  its prejudicial effect to be admissible. The similarity between the acts may 
  consist of a unique trade mark or signature [or] a series of significant similarities.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) In assessing the similarity of the acts, the trial judge 
  should only consider the manner in which the acts were committed and not the 
  evidence as to the accused&#146;s involvement in each act.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) There may well be exceptions but as a general rule if there 
  is such a degree of similarity between the acts that it is likely that they 
  were committed by the same person then the similar fact evidence will ordinarily 
  have sufficient probative force to outweigh its prejudicial effect and may be 
  admitted.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The jury will then be able to consider all the evidence 
  related to the alleged similar acts in determining the accused&#146;s guilt 
  for any one act.</p>
<p>(3) The Application in this Case of the Test for the</p>
<p>
  Admission of Similar Fact Evidence</p>
<p>
  [66] The appellant makes two arguments concerning the alleged similar fact evidence. 
</p>
<p>[67] First, he asserts that the trial judge erred by failing to properly assess 
  the probative value of the alleged similar acts in his first ruling. In particular, 
  counsel for the appellant maintained in oral argument that the trial judge erred 
  by failing to assess the alleged similarity of the acts, as distinct from assessing 
  the evidence linking the appellant to the alleged acts, and by holding that 
  the tendered similar fact evidence met the striking similarity standard. Although 
  the appellant makes several submissions in support of those arguments, in my 
  view they may conveniently be considered under two headings: (a) the trial judge&#146;s 
  consideration of the evidence linking the appellant to the alleged similar acts; 
  and (b) the trial judge&#146;s assessment of the cogency of the similar fact 
  evidence.</p>
<p>[68] Second, the appellant asserts that the trial judge erred in his third 
  ruling by permitting the Crown to lead evidence establishing that the appellant 
  shot someone during the St. Thomas robbery. </p>
<p>[69] I will consider each of these arguments in turn.</p>
<p>(i) The First Ruling: Assessment of the Probative Value of the Similar Fact 
  Evidence</p>

<p> (a) The trial judge&#146;s consideration of the evidence linking the appellant 
  to the alleged similar acts</p>
<p>[70] In his first ruling, the trial judge provided a brief description of the 
  alleged similar acts, referenced the general exclusionary rule which renders 
  similar fact evidence presumptively inadmissible, and identified the narrow 
  basis for its admission, that is, when its probative value outweighs its prejudicial 
  effect. As well, he recognized the standard of striking similarity which applies 
  to the reception of similar fact evidence tendered to establish identity and 
  indicated that he applied that standard to his assessment of the similar fact 
  evidence tendered by the Crown. He also stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> I accept that the standard of proof required of the Crown is also found in 
  [R. v. B.(L.) (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.)], and is; [sic] that there 
  must be some evidence of a link between the accused and the acts of discreditable 
  conduct as a pre-condition to admissibility. This quantum of proof is essential 
  to inquire into probative value and if there is no sufficient link that the 
  accused committed the act, it has no probative value.</p>
<p>[71] Counsel for the appellant argues in reliance on the decision of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in Arp that the trial judge erred by considering the evidence 
  linking the appellant to the alleged similar acts before assessing the similarity 
  of the alleged acts. She quite properly does not dispute the trial judge&#146;s 
  holding that evidence linking the appellant to the alleged acts was a necessary 
  precondition to the admissibility of the similar fact evidence. That principle 
  is firmly established. See, for example, Sweitzer v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 
  949. Rather, she asserts that the trial judge&#146;s consideration of that issue 
  was premature because it diverted his attention from the critical assessment 
  of the similarity of the alleged acts in relation to the offences charged. In 
  essence, she maintains that the trial judge misapprehended the initial inquiry 
  or threshold test for the admission of similar fact evidence and, as a result, 
  his assessment of the similarities of the alleged acts was fatally flawed.</p>
<p>[72] In considering those submissions, three important matters which affected 
  the conduct of the voir dire and the trial judge&#146;s first ruling on the 
  similar fact evidence should be emphasized at the outset.</p>
<p>[73] First, the trial judge&#146;s approach to his analysis (first considering 
  the evidence which linked the appellant and Norouzali to the similar acts) was 
  urged upon him during the voir dire by trial counsel for both the Crown and 
  the appellant (not counsel on this appeal). In her submissions to the trial 
  judge on the voir dire, for example, one of the appellant&#146;s trial counsel 
  stated: &#147;Now, if you cannot determine that the acts are those of the accused, 
  then that is the end of this entire debate. You don&#146;t even go any further. 
  I submit that&#146;s where the Crown&#146;s case fails, right there&#148;. Similarly, 
  in reliance on the decision of this court in R. v. B.(L.) (1997), 116 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 481 and the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Sweitzer, Crown 
  counsel at trial framed the applicable initial inquiry as follows: &#147;The 
  first branch of this particular test: is this conduct alleged as similar fact 
  the [conduct] of the accused?&#148;</p>
<p>[74] Second, in his reasons for his first ruling, the trial judge considered 
  the factors and followed the framework of analysis suggested in R. v. B.(L.) 
  to be applicable in balancing the probative value of proposed similar fact evidence 
  against its prejudicial effect. At the time of the voir dire, the decision in 
  R. v. B.(L.) was a recent authority from this court regarding the admissibility 
  of similar fact evidence. In that case it was held that the inquiry into a link 
  between allegedly similar acts and the accused was the first step in the inquiry 
  into the relevance of proposed similar fact evidence. As observed by Charron 
  J.A. in R. v. B.(L.) at p. 491, &#147;The inquiry into relevance and materiality 
  in fact constitutes the threshold test for admissibility of all evidence.&#148;</p>
<p>[75] Third, neither the trial judge nor trial counsel had the benefit on the 
  voir dire of the Supreme Court of Canada&#146;s recent decisions in Arp, Handy 
  and Shearing, which were released after the trial in issue on this appeal.</p>
<p>[76] R. v. B.(L.) confirmed the requirement that the trial judge, during the 
  process of balancing the probative value of similar fact evidence against its 
  prejudicial effect, inquire into whether the alleged similar acts are those 
  of the accused. R. v. B.(L.) was not an identification case. Rather, it concerned 
  the admissibility of alleged prior bad acts or discreditable conduct in a trial 
  concerning sexual offences. In my view, to the extent that the decision in R. 
  v. B.(L.) is to be regarded as of general application in similar fact cases, 
  it must now be read in light of the more recent jurisprudence from the Supreme 
  Court of Canada concerning, in particular, the admissibility of similar fact 
  evidence tendered in proof of identity. That jurisprudence, as I have stated, 
  was not available to the trial judge or trial counsel in this case.</p>
<p>[77] Justice Cory emphasized in Arp that, where identity is at issue, ordinarily 
  the trial judge must first review the manner in which the similar acts were 
  committed in order to determine whether it is likely that the alleged similar 
  acts were all committed by the same person. It is useful to repeat the salient 
  part of Cory J.&#146;s direction at p. 342: </p>
<p class="indent">Where identity is at issue ordinarily, the trial judge should review the manner 
  in which the similar acts were committed &#150; that is to say, whether the 
  similar acts involve a unique trademark or reveal a number of significant similarities. 
  This review will enable him or her to decide whether the alleged similar acts 
  were all committed by the same person. This preliminary determination establishes 
  the objective improbability that the accused&#146;s involvement in the alleged 
  acts is the product of coincidence and thereby gives the evidence the requisite 
  probative force. Thus, where the similar fact evidence is adduced to prove identity, 
  once this preliminary determination is made, the evidence related to the similar 
  act (or count, in a multi-count indictment) may be admitted to prove the commission 
  of another act (or count) [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[78] Justice Cory thus twice described the trial judge&#146;s review of the 
  manner in which the similar acts were committed as a &#147;preliminary determination&#148;. 
  He then further commented at p. 344: </p>
<p class="indent">Where the fact in issue is the identity of the perpetrator of 
  the crime, then in the usual course of events the trial judge must assess the 
  degree of similarity demonstrated by the manner in which the acts in question 
  were committed to determine whether it is likely the same person committed the 
  alleged similar acts. Once it is determined on a balance of probabilities that 
  the same person committed the alleged similar acts, the similar fact evidence 
  may be admitted to prove that the accused committed the offence or offences 
  in question.</p>
<p class="indent">In determining whether similar fact evidence should be admitted 
  to prove identity, the trial judge must have regard to the manner in which the 
  alleged similar acts were committed. In general, evidence linking the accused 
  to each alleged similar act should not be part of this evaluation&#133;.In other 
  words, the similarity of the acts indicates whether one person committed the 
  crimes: in most cases, evidence as to the accused&#146;s connection to each 
  similar act indicates whether the accused committed the crimes. Only after the 
  trial judge has considered the manner of the commission of the similar acts 
  and is satisfied that there is evidence which could lead the jury to conclude 
  that all the acts were committed by one person should he or she admit the evidence 
  related to each act for the jury&#146;s consideration, including the evidence 
  of the accused&#146;s involvement in each similar act [underlined emphasis in 
  first and third paragraphs in original; other emphasis added].</p>
<p>[79] Thus, the assessment of the similarities of the prior acts is centred 
  on the similarities in, or the unifying features of, the manner in which the 
  alleged acts were committed. The objective of the assessment is to determine 
  the likelihood, or otherwise, of coincidence, that is, whether it is likely 
  that the similar acts were all committed by the same person. That assessment, 
  at least in the first instance, is not concerned with whether a particular accused 
  can be connected to the alleged acts.</p>
<p>[80] Justice Cory&#146;s observations on this issue, fairly read, were not 
  intended to establish a rigid rule: Arp at p. 345, per Cory J. For that reason, 
  he prefaced his remarks with the words &#147;in general&#148;. Nonetheless, 
  his comments underscore the importance of differentiating the evaluation of 
  the similarities of the alleged acts from the evaluation of the evidence linking 
  the accused to the acts and the need to embark upon the former evaluation as 
  a preliminary inquiry. </p>
<p>[81] Based on Arp, in general, only if the manner of commission of the alleged 
  similar acts tends to suggest the likelihood that all the alleged acts were 
  committed by the same person is it necessary to then take the next step of assessing 
  the factors which connect the accused to the alleged acts. The reception of 
  the tendered similar fact evidence ultimately requires the trial judge to be 
  satisfied on both inquiries. I should not be taken, however, as suggesting that 
  there will never be cases where evidence concerning the involvement of the accused 
  in the alleged similar acts would not be material to the assessment of the similarities 
  of the alleged acts. There may well be cases, as implicitly recognized by Cory 
  J. in Arp, where examination of the factors which connect the accused to the 
  alleged acts should form part of the assessment of the manner of commission 
  of the alleged similar acts and, hence, of the initial determination of whether 
  the tendered evidence is admissible: see, for example, R. v. Dickinson (1984), 
  40 C.R. (3d) 384 (Ont. C.A.) at 389. This, however, was not such a case.</p>
<p>[82] The reasons of the trial judge indicate, as alleged by the appellant, 
  that he approached the threshold test for admissibility of the similar fact 
  evidence on the basis of an assessment of the evidence tendered to demonstrate 
  a link between the similar acts and the appellant and Norouzali. I reiterate, 
  given the submissions made by both counsel on the voir dire and the decision 
  in R. v. B.(L.), that approach was understandable. In light of the subsequent 
  decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Arp, however, I conclude that the 
  trial judge erred in this case by adopting that approach. In many cases, the 
  fact that the trial judge first considered whether there was any evidence linking 
  the accused to the alleged similar acts (the approach identified in R. v. B.(L.)) 
  will not constitute reversible error. In this case, however, in my view, that 
  approach skewed the trial judge&#146;s reasoning on the vital issue of the degree 
  of similarity between the alleged acts and the charged acts. </p>
<p>[83] In assessing the evidence connecting the appellant and Norouzali to the 
  alleged similar acts, the trial judge made brief mention of what he regarded 
  as the &#147;common features&#148; of the armed robberies. He stated that they 
  included &#147;general descriptions by witnesses that one of the robbers was 
  shorter than the other and was in command; guns were used threateningly and 
  on occasion fired; balaclavas were worn; and the facts and pleas in respect 
  of [the St. Thomas robbery].&#148; He also had regard to the DNA evidence linking 
  Norouzali to Gagnons and the evidence establishing that the appellant was seen 
  with Norouzali on the morning of September 15, 1994, and concluded that there 
  was some evidence that the conduct in question could be attributed to the appellant 
  and Norouzali.</p>
<p>[84] At this stage of his analysis, however, the trial judge did not undertake 
  any detailed scrutiny of the similarities or, importantly, of the dissimilarities 
  between the alleged acts and the charged acts. Had he done so, the weaknesses 
  of some of the similar fact evidence would have been cast in clear relief. In 
  particular, close scrutiny of the similarities and dissimilarities of the alleged 
  acts at the outset of the trial judge&#146;s analysis would have shown that 
  the Crown had not established that all five similar acts (the five armed robberies) 
  were likely committed by the same persons. </p>
<p>[85] Consideration of the evidence concerning the First London robbery illustrates 
  this point. The modus operandi of the bank robber did not match the modus operandi 
  of the robbers at Gagnons. Two assailants were involved at Gagnons. A single 
  assailant entered the bank branch during the First London robbery. The robber 
  in charge at Gagnons was said to be controlling and aggressive, issuing commands 
  to persons in the store. The evidence regarding the perpetrator of the First 
  London robbery did not suggest that he behaved in that fashion. As well, the 
  robbers at Gagnons entered through the front door. The bank robber smashed a 
  window with a brick to gain entry to the bank. In addition, the Gagnons robbery 
  occurred in the late afternoon, before the close of business. The First London 
  robbery took place in the morning, before the bank opened to the public for 
  business.</p>
<p>[86] The Crown argues that the evidence of the use of firearms traceable to 
  Gagnons was accepted by the trial judge as a badge or hallmark of the similar 
  acts which, when viewed in combination with the rest of the evidence relied 
  upon by the Crown, effectively eclipsed the dissimilarities of the alleged acts. 
  That argument does not assist the Crown in relation to the First London robbery: 
  the Ruger stolen from Gagnons was eliminated as the firearm discharged during 
  the First London robbery and the Colt stolen from Gagnons could neither be eliminated 
  nor linked to that robbery. </p>
<p>[87] Crown counsel asserts that the fact that the Colt stolen from Gagnons 
  could neither be eliminated nor linked to the First London robbery held some 
  evidential value when examining the common features between that robbery and 
  the events at Gagnons. In that connection, Crown counsel acknowledged during 
  oral argument before this court that, without that evidence, the First London 
  robbery did not satisfy the test for the admission of similar fact evidence; 
  he submits, however, that the evidence concerning the First London robbery can 
  draw strength or increased probative worth from the evidence regarding the other 
  armed robberies. </p>
<p>[88] I do not agree. Given the significant differences between the Gagnons 
  robbery and the First London robbery, the Crown&#146;s case that they were likely 
  committed by the same persons depended on the alleged signature or hallmark 
  that the same weapon was used in each. Evidence that one of the guns stolen 
  from Gagnons could not be eliminated as the gun used in the First London robbery 
  was not evidence that it was used in the latter robbery.</p>
<p>[89] I conclude, in the circumstances, that the trail judge&#146;s initial 
  focus on the evidence linking the appellant and Norouzali to the alleged similar 
  acts, to the virtual exclusion of an assessment of the similarities and dissimilarities 
  of the alleged acts, was reversible error. The result of that approach was to 
  deflect the trial judge&#146;s analysis away from the rigorous scrutiny of the 
  alleged acts required to determine their admissibility. That level of early 
  scrutiny would have illuminated the weaknesses inherent in some of the similar 
  fact evidence tendered by the Crown.</p>
<p>(b) The trial judge&#146;s assessment of the cogency of the similar fact evidence: 
  the striking similarity standard </p>
<p>
  [90] The trial judge identified the purposes for which the similar fact evidence 
  was tendered as being the &#147;very live issue of identity and&#133;the issue 
  of method or pattern or modus operandi.&#148; That issue identification was 
  uncontroversial. </p>
<p>[91] In assessing the probative value of the similar fact evidence, the trial 
  judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> Firstly, when examining the armed robberies in which 45&#146;s 
  can be identified as being weapons used in their commission, there is little 
  doubt that the further evidence that the two 45&#146;s were included among those 
  guns stolen from Gagnons sports store in September 1994, and were seized from 
  Woodcock and Norouzali in their arrest for the National Grocers armed robbery 
  in March 1995 constitutes powerful evidence. Even more powerful is the DNA evidence 
  attributable to Norouzali found to be present in respect of both the September 
  1994 and March 1995 crimes. This evidence, coupled with the evidentiary link 
  of the two 45&#146;s being used in armed robberies in September 1994, November 
  1994, and March 1995 increases the strength of the evidence when it is considered 
  in combination. When further combined with the method of all the robberies, 
  the general descriptions and conduct of the robbers and their general method 
  of operation, the totality of the evidence has a very high degree of probative 
  value in respect of the issue of identity.</p>
<p class="indent">I have examined each incident of discreditable conduct and the 
  evidence relative to the incident and applied the tests set out herein to determine 
  the admissibility of the proposed evidence. Thereafter, I considered and assessed 
  the totality of the nature of the proposed discreditable conduct, the circumstances 
  surrounding each of them, and their connection to each other as well as to the 
  offences giving rise to this trial. </p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> I find that the general method of the robberies and the conduct 
  and descriptions of the robbers in all the proposed armed robberies amount to 
  conduct that is very similar. I reach this conclusion notwithstanding my awareness 
  that many robberies are no doubt committed in similar fashion as that described 
  in the proposed evidence. However, when such evidence is combined with the fact 
  that the robberies in this action were committed with the two 45&#146;s being 
  brandished by the two generally described robbers, the similarities become &#147;strikingly 
  similar&#148;. In my view, when the evidence is considered in totality, the 
  robberies have a &#147;hallmark&#148; feature or &#147;signature&#148; to them 
  that is made all the more distinctive by the specifics of [sic] guns used. I 
  am, on the evidence presented on this voir dire, able to say that the evidence 
  of the proposed discreditable conduct is so similar to the Gagnons sports store 
  robbery that it is unlikely that it was committed by persons other than Woodcock 
  and Norouzali. That being the case I find that the probative value of the proposed 
  evidence is of high value to the issue of identification and to method of operation 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[92] The appellant&#146;s counsel submits that the trial judge erred by holding 
  that the similar fact evidence met the requisite standard of striking similarity. 
  She argues that the similarities among the alleged acts are not striking. She 
  also asserts that the trial judge erred by failing to properly assess the dissimilarities 
  among the alleged acts. In considering those submissions and the basis for the 
  trial judge&#146;s conclusion that the requisite striking similarity standard 
  was met, it is useful to first review the Crown&#146;s position on the voir 
  dire regarding the similar fact evidence.</p>
<p>[93] There were three parts to the Crown&#146;s argument on the voir dire in 
  support of the admission of the similar fact evidence. First, the Crown submitted 
  that the armed robberies represented a continuum or pattern of similar criminal 
  conduct by the appellant and Norouzali, commencing with the robbery and shootings 
  at Gagnons on September 14, 1994 and ending with the St. Thomas robbery on March 
  10, 1995. The Crown tendered evidence of the London robberies, which occurred 
  between those two dates, as relevant to prove the identity of the perpetrators 
  of the Gagnons robbery and shootings.</p>
<p>[94] The Crown submitted that the evidence regarding the London robberies was 
  divisible into two categories: (a) the evidence concerning those robberies which 
  allegedly could be &#147;directly linked&#148; to the events at Gagnons; and 
  (b) the evidence concerning those robberies which the Crown acknowledged could 
  only be &#147;linked indirectly&#148; or circumstantially to the events at Gagnons. 
  On the Crown&#146;s theory, the evidence concerning the Second and Third London 
  robberies fell within the first &#147;directly linked&#148; category, while 
  the evidence concerning the First and Fourth London robberies came within the 
  second, &#147;indirectly linked&#148; category. </p>
<p>[95] The second aspect of the Crown&#146;s position was that the similarities 
  between the events at Gagnons and the St. Thomas robbery were so strikingly 
  similar that, even without regard to the evidence matching the Ruger and the 
  Colt stolen from Gagnons to the firearms recovered after the St. Thomas robbery, 
  the evidence regarding the latter incident was admissible as relevant to establishing 
  identity.</p>
<p>[96] Third, the Crown properly argued that the trial judge was entitled, in 
  determining the admissibility of the similar fact evidence, to consider the 
  totality of the evidence relied upon by the Crown in its case against the appellant, 
  including the circumstances surrounding the commission of the armed robberies. 
  As relevant on this appeal, the additional, non-similar fact evidence relied 
  upon by the Crown included: </p>
<p class="indent">(i) the nature of the Gagnons robbery and the manner of its 
  execution;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the motive in the Gagnons robbery, that is, the allegation 
  that it was a planned robbery for the purpose of stealing firearms rather than 
  money;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the presence of Norouzali&#146;s DNA at the scene of the 
  Gagnons robbery and in Thomas&#146; car;</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) the sighting of the appellant with Norouzali in London 
  during the morning of September 15, 1994; </p>
<p class="indent">(v) the matching of the firearms recovered following the St. 
  Thomas robbery to the Ruger and the Colt stolen from Gagnons;</p>
<p class="indent">(vi) Thompson&#146;s evidence of the retrieval by the appellant 
  or Norouzali, or both of them, of uns from a hidden countryside location prior 
  to the St. Thomas robbery;</p>
<p class="indent">(vii) Thompson&#146;s evidence that the appellant told him, 
  prior to the St. Thomas robbery, that he would obtain the guns for that robbery;</p>
<p class="indent">(viii) Thompson&#146;s evidence that he provided the appellant 
  with .45 calibre ammunition from time to time; and </p>
<p class="indent">(ix) the actual height of the appellant and Norouzali as confirmed 
  when they were booked at the police station following their arrest (the appellant 
  was 5&#146;6&#148; tall and Norouzali was 5&#146;9&#148; tall).</p>
<p>[97] Although I may not have reached the same conclusion, I am satisfied that 
  it was open to the trial judge on the evidence on the voir dire to find that 
  the similar fact evidence concerning the Second and Third London robberies and 
  the St. Thomas robbery met the striking similarity standard. I am not persuaded, 
  however, that that finding was open to him in connection with the First and 
  Fourth London robberies.</p>
<p>The St. Thomas Robbery</p>
<p>
  [98] The Crown had a strong case for the admission of the similar fact evidence 
  concerning the St. Thomas robbery. The appellant, Norouzali and Thompson were 
  caught by the police shortly after the robbery. Accordingly, the identity of 
  the perpetrators of that robbery was not in issue. Further, the evidence on 
  the voir dire established significant connecting factors between the St. Thomas 
  robbery and the events at Gagnons. They included: the robbers used loaded guns 
  in both robberies; a firearm was discharged in both robberies; at least one 
  person was deliberately shot in both robberies; two of the three firearms recovered 
  after the St. Thomas robbery (the Colt and the Ruger) were traced to the firearms 
  stolen from Gagnons; Norouzali was in possession of one of the traced firearms; 
  DNA evidence established that Norouzali was the second robber at Gagnons, but 
  not the shooter; the robber who was described by witnesses as the man in charge 
  during the St. Thomas robbery, like the robber in charge at Gagnons, was shorter 
  and heavier than the perpetrator of the St. Thomas robbery who was said to be 
  the next most actively involved perpetrator in the conduct of that robbery; 
  the robbers wore balaclavas or masks during both robberies; the robbers fled, 
  or attempted to flee, on both occasions in a stolen vehicle; and a theft occurred 
  during each incident.</p>
<p>[99] As well, the appellant and Norouzali pleaded guilty to offences arising 
  from the St. Thomas robbery. In the appellant&#146;s case, he acknowledged the 
  facts surrounding the St. Thomas robbery as part of his guilty plea. </p>
<p>[100] Finally, certain of the admitted facts surrounding the commission of 
  the St. Thomas robbery, as acknowledged by the appellant&#146;s trial counsel 
  on the voir dire, were admissible without regard to the similar fact rule: for 
  example, the fact that the appellant was with Norouzali and Thompson when they 
  were found on March 10, 1995 in possession of two guns subsequently traced to 
  Gagnons.</p>
<p>[101] I conclude, therefore, that there was a sound evidentiary basis on the 
  voir dire supporting the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that the asserted facts 
  concerning the St. Thomas robbery were strikingly similar to the events at Gagnons. 
  Indeed, during oral argument of this appeal, counsel for the appellant did not 
  vigorously suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>The Second and Third London Robberies</p>
<p>
  [102] I reach a similar conclusion concerning the Second and Third London robberies.</p>
<p>[103] The evidence tendered by the Crown concerning the Second London robbery 
  indicated that two armed robbers, both wearing balaclavas and one shorter than 
  the other, carried out the robbery. Again, guns were discharged. Expert evidence 
  established a direct connection between one of the discharged firearms and the 
  Ruger stolen from Gagnons. As well, the shorter robber involved in the Second 
  London robbery was described by witnesses as being in charge or in command of 
  the robbery. The men fled from the scene in a stolen vehicle. Those facts, in 
  my view, bore striking resemblance to the facts asserted in relation to the 
  events at Gagnons and provided evidence which supported the Crown&#146;s assertion 
  that the same two persons likely committed the Second London robbery and the 
  robbery and shootings at Gagnons.</p>
<p>[104] The Third London robbery was again carried out by two armed robbers wearing 
  balaclavas. The shorter of the two robbers was described as in charge of the 
  robbery and was said to be acting aggressively. He discharged a firearm in the 
  direction of a bank employee. Both robbers fled the scene in a stolen car. The 
  firearms discharged during the Third London robbery were linked by expert evidence 
  to the Ruger and the Colt stolen from Gagnons. It was open to the trial judge 
  to conclude, in my opinion, that those facts established striking connections 
  between the Third London robbery and the events at Gagnons. Thus, there was 
  a cogent evidentiary basis for the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that the standard 
  of striking similarity had been met in respect of the Third London robbery. 
</p>
<p>The First and Fourth London Robberies</p>
<p>
  [105] In contrast, the evidence of similarities between the First and Fourth 
  London robberies and the robbery and shootings at Gagnons was materially weaker. 
  That fact was recognized by the Crown on the voir dire when Crown counsel grouped 
  the First and Fourth London robberies in a separate category of &#147;indirectly 
  linked&#148; similar acts and when he urged that the armed robberies be regarded 
  as part of a larger continuum of criminal conduct.</p>
<p>[106] The trial judge&#146;s conclusion that the similar fact evidence concerning 
  the armed robberies, including the First and Fourth London robberies, satisfied 
  the striking similarity standard was based on: (a) the evidence matching the 
  Ruger and the Colt stolen from Gagnons to the firearms recovered after the St. 
  Thomas robbery; (b) the DNA evidence linking Norouzali to Gagnons; (c) the evidence 
  concerning the general method of the robberies and the conduct and the descriptions 
  of the robbers &#147;in all the proposed armed robberies&#148; [emphasis added]; 
  and (d) the &#147;totality&#148; of the evidence relied upon by the Crown in 
  its case against the appellant and Norouzali, including the non-similar fact 
  evidence. </p>
<p>[107] No separate connecting factors or discrete similarity analyses concerning 
  the First and Fourth London robberies are set out in the trial judge&#146;s 
  reasons.</p>
<p>[108] In addition, as I have mentioned, the trial judge did not expressly address 
  the dissimilarities of the alleged acts in his reasons. As pointed out by Crown 
  counsel on this appeal, the alleged dissimilarities were canvassed by one of 
  the appellant&#146;s trial counsel during her submissions on the voir dire. 
  Accordingly, it cannot be said that the trial judge was not aware of the dissimilarities. 
  Nonetheless, in the absence of any discussion of the dissimilarities in the 
  first ruling, I cannot be certain that the trial judge considered the full array 
  and the significance of the dissimilarities arising on the alleged facts of 
  the First and Fourth London robberies and that he adequately assessed the cogency 
  of those particular alleged acts.</p>
<p>[109] The issue, therefore, is whether the evidence relied upon by the trial 
  judge to support his conclusion that the similar fact evidence concerning all 
  of the armed robberies met the striking similarity standard in fact supports 
  that conclusion in connection with the First and Fourth London robberies. In 
  my view it does not, for several reasons.</p>
<p>[110] First, in reaching his conclusion that the striking similarity standard 
  had been met in connection with all of the robberies, the trial judge relied 
  on the evidence matching the Ruger and the Colt stolen from Gagnons to the firearms 
  recovered after the St. Thomas robbery. There is no doubt that this evidence 
  was of powerful probative force. It had no relevance or probative value, however, 
  in connection with the First and Fourth London robberies because the stolen 
  Ruger and Colt were not traced to the firearms used during those incidents. 
  As acknowledged by Crown counsel on this appeal, the trial judge clearly misspoke, 
  or overly generalized, when he indicated that there was an evidentiary link 
  between the Ruger and the Colt and the &#147;robberies in September 1994&#148;. 
  The Ruger was eliminated as the firearm discharged at the First London robbery 
  (the September 19, 1994 robbery) and the Colt could neither be eliminated nor 
  linked to that robbery. </p>
<p>[111] Ammunition recovered after the Fourth London robbery was later found 
  to be .45 calibre ammunition that had been reloaded on the Thompsons&#146; reloading 
  press. There was also evidence from Thompson that he had provided the appellant 
  with .45 calibre ammunition from time to time. There was no evidence, however, 
  regarding when he had done so in relation to September 1994; nor was there evidence 
  that he had ever provided Norouzali with such ammunition. </p>
<p>[112] There is no doubt that the next evidentiary factor relied upon by the 
  trial judge, that is, the DNA evidence linking Norouzali to Gagnons, was also 
  very strong, and admissible evidence. It was irrelevant, however, to prove that 
  the same two persons who committed the robbery and shootings at Gagnons also 
  likely committed the First and Fourth London robberies. </p>
<p>[113] As well, I do not agree that the evidence of the general method of the 
  First and Fourth London robberies, and of the conduct and the descriptions of 
  the robbers involved in those incidents, was strikingly similar to those factors 
  in the robbery and shootings at Gagnons.</p>
<p>[114] As cautioned by Binnie J. in Shearing at para. 60, &#147;dissimilarities 
  can always be exaggerated and multiplied&#148;, leading to distortion. In this 
  case, however, I am of the opinion that there were very significant dissimilarities 
  between the First and Fourth London robberies and the charged offences. I have 
  already outlined in these reasons certain of the key dissimilarities between 
  the First London robbery and the events at Gagnons. In connection with the Fourth 
  London robbery, those dissimilarities included: </p>
<p class="indent">(i) unlike the Gagnons incident, no shots were fired during 
  the Fourth London robbery; and</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the &#147;hallmark&#148; relied upon by the Crown, that 
  is, the use of firearms stolen from Gagnons, was not demonstrated to apply to 
  the Fourth London robbery; neither the stolen Ruger nor the stolen Colt were 
  linked to this robbery, although the ammunition recovered at the scene was later 
  determined to be ammunition which had been reloaded on the Thompsons&#146; reloading 
  press.</p>
<p>[115] The trial judge held in respect of the Fourth London robbery that &#147;the 
  method, general descriptions of the robbers and conduct is [sic] consistent 
  with that described above&#148;. Although the similarities relied upon by the 
  Crown concerning the Fourth London robbery were undoubtedly stronger than were 
  those relating to the First London robbery, given the significant dissimilarities 
  between the First and Fourth London robberies and the charged offences which 
  I have mentioned, it is my view that the similar fact evidence favourable to 
  the Crown&#146;s position concerning the method and the conduct of the robbers 
  involved in the First and Fourth London robberies did not reach the requisite 
  high or striking level of similarity necessary to show that the same persons 
  who committed those robberies likely committed the robbery and shootings at 
  Gagnons.</p>
<p>[116] Finally, the trial judge relied upon the &#147;totality&#148; of the 
  Crown&#146;s evidence in its case against the appellant and Norouzali in concluding 
  that the facts of all the armed robberies, including the facts concerning the 
  First and Fourth London robberies, met the striking similarity standard. I have 
  previously set out the non-similar fact evidence relied upon by the Crown on 
  the voir dire. It concerns: (a) the alleged facts relating to the events at 
  or circumstances surrounding the Gagnons and St. Thomas robberies; (b) the established 
  physical characteristics of the appellant and Norouzali; (c) the matching of 
  the recovered Ruger and Colt to the firearms stolen at Gagnons; and (d) the 
  sighting of the appellant with Norouzali in London on September 15, 1994.</p>
<p>[117] In my view, only the evidence regarding the sighting of the appellant 
  in the company of Norouzali can be said to strengthen the probative worth of 
  the evidence concerning either the First or Fourth London robberies in any material 
  way. </p>
<p>[118] The appellant was seen with Norouzali in London only four days before 
  the First London robbery. That fact establishes a temporal connection between 
  the events at Gagnons and the First London robbery, thereby strengthening the 
  evidential basis for the asserted involvement of the same robbers in the latter 
  incident. The evidential reach of the sighting, however, is limited to the First 
  London robbery. It does not have the same temporal connection to the Fourth 
  London robbery. Moreover, viewed singly or in combination with the other evidence 
  relied upon by the Crown, in my view the sighting falls far short of elevating 
  the connections between the First London robbery and the events at Gagnons to 
  the high threshold required by the striking similarity standard. </p>
<p>[119] I am mindful that the required degree of similarity in identification 
  cases can be established upon demonstration of a number of proven significant 
  similarities or a hallmark or signature feature common to the similar acts and 
  the charged act(s). I conclude that it was open to the trial judge on the evidence 
  to find that such similarities and the hallmark of the use of firearms stolen 
  from Gagnons existed in connection with the Second and Third London robberies 
  and the St. Thomas robbery. I am not persuaded, however, that either method 
  of meeting the high degree of similarity standard requisite in identification 
  cases was effective concerning the First and Fourth London robberies. </p>
<p>(c) The trial judge&#146;s assessment of the cogency of the similar fact evidence: 
  the evidence linking the appellant to the alleged similar acts</p>
<p>
  [120] In accordance with the decision in Arp, it is necessary in deciding upon 
  the admissibility of alleged similar fact evidence to first consider the similarity 
  of the alleged acts, generally without regard to the evidence as to the accused&#146;s 
  involvement in each act. Once that preliminary assessment has been conducted, 
  it is then necessary to assess the factors, if any, which connect the accused 
  to the alleged acts. Both assessments are integrally related to the evaluation 
  of the cogency of tendered similar fact evidence.</p>
<p>[121] In this case, even if the requisite striking similarity standard was 
  satisfied in connection with all of the alleged similar acts, which in my view 
  does not apply here, I conclude that the evidence did not establish a connection 
  between the First and Fourth London robberies and the appellant. Only brief 
  reference to the evidence is necessary to illustrate this deficiency in the 
  Crown&#146;s case against the appellant.</p>
<p>[122] First, the assailant in the First London robbery was described as a black, 
  bearded male. He was said by some witnesses to be 5&#146;6&#148; tall. Other 
  witnesses said that he was 5&#146;7&#148; to 5&#146;8&#148; tall. In contrast, 
  the appellant is white, has brown hair and is balding. Thus, although the appellant 
  is 5&#146;6&#148; tall, the descriptions of the perpetrator involved in the 
  First London robbery did not generally match key physical characteristics of 
  the appellant. </p>
<p>[123] In addition, it was the Crown&#146;s position at trial that the appellant 
  was the robber in charge and the shooter at Gagnons, who was described by witnesses 
  as having acted aggressively and peremptorily. As I earlier mentioned, the alleged 
  conduct of the assailant in the First London robbery did not match the described 
  conduct of the robber at Gagnons who was alleged to be the appellant.</p>
<p>[124] Thus, the evidence of the physical features and the conduct of the assailant 
  involved in the First London robbery is consistent with the commission of that 
  robbery by a person other than the appellant. The factors supporting this possibility 
  were not addressed by the trial judge in his rulings on the similar fact evidence. 
  Stated bluntly, no nexus between the appellant and the First London robbery 
  was established on the voir dire. Moreover, I agree with the appellant&#146;s 
  submission that the absence of such a nexus was underscored during the course 
  of the trial, when the defence theory of an alternate suspect emerged.</p>
<p>[125] Similarly, no significant connection between the appellant and the Fourth 
  London robbery was demonstrated by the Crown. Although the Crown relied on Thompson&#146;s 
  evidence that he had provided the appellant with .45 calibre ammunition from 
  time to time to assert a link between the appellant and the Fourth London robbery, 
  Thompson&#146;s evidence did not establish when he had provided such ammunition 
  to the appellant. In addition, the fact of the use of .45 calibre ammunition 
  during the Fourth London robbery was not itself relevant to proof of the identity 
  of the user of the ammunition, particularly when the defence theory at trial 
  implicated an alternate suspect (Thompson) who had ready and on-going access 
  to .45 calibre ammunition. Accordingly, Thompson&#146;s evidence concerning 
  the provision to the appellant of .45 calibre ammunition did not further in 
  any material way the inquiry in relation to the appellant sought to be advanced 
  by the admission of the evidence concerning the Fourth London robbery, that 
  is, proof of the identity of the appellant as one of the perpetrators of and 
  the shooter at Gagnons.</p>
<p>[126] Moreover, the physical descriptions of the assailant in control of the 
  Fourth London robbery did not accord with the appellant&#146;s proven physical 
  characteristics. The former assailant was described by witnesses as having olive-coloured 
  skin and being between 5&#146;8&#148; and 5&#146;10&#148; tall. Those characteristics 
  did not match the established physical features of the appellant; nor were they 
  similar to the characteristics of the robber at Gagnons alleged by the Crown 
  to be the appellant.</p>
<p>[127] While there are important reasons for an appellate court to apply a high 
  degree of deference to a trial judge&#146;s decision on the admissibility of 
  similar fact evidence and to his or her appreciation of the evidence, that deference 
  is inapplicable in the face of an error of law: R. v. B.(C.R.) (1990), 55 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at pp. 23-24, per McLachlin J.; R. v. B.(L.) at p. 505, per 
  Charron J.A.; and Arp at p. 340, per Cory J. Stated somewhat differently, a 
  trial judge does not have the discretion to admit similar fact evidence where 
  its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value: Shearing at pp. 250-51, 
  per Binnie J. I conclude, for the reasons stated, that the tendered evidence 
  regarding the First and Fourth London robberies did not meet the striking similarity 
  standard and, further, did not establish a nexus between the appellant and the 
  alleged similar acts. The prejudicial effect of the evidence concerning those 
  robberies was undisputed and outweighed its probative value. Accordingly, that 
  evidence should not have been admitted.</p>
<p>[128] Crown counsel argues that the admission of the similar fact evidence 
  concerning the First London robbery did not taint the verdicts in this case. 
  He relies on the trial judge&#146;s instructions to the jury that, when deciding 
  whether there were similarities among the alleged acts, the jury should look 
  to the totality of the evidence and, as well, that it had to find beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that the appellant had committed the alleged similar acts.</p>
<p>[129] I agree with the Crown that the latter instruction favoured the defence. 
  Since the decision in Arp, it is clear that a jury need only be satisfied on 
  a balance of probabilities that the same person committed the similar acts in 
  question: see Arp at pp. 344 and 349-54, per Cory J. In this case, however, 
  I have concluded that the evidence concerning two of the similar acts did not 
  meet the requisite striking similarity standard or establish a connection to 
  the appellant. The favourable jury instruction could not cure the strong prejudice 
  occasioned to the appellant by the introduction of inadmissible similar fact 
  evidence; nor could it ensure that the dangers of propensity evidence warned 
  against by Sopinka J. in R. v. D.(L.E.) were avoided. The probative value of 
  the alleged facts concerning the First and Fourth London robberies was slight 
  and far out-weighed by their prejudicial effect. I conclude that a new trial 
  is required in the interests of justice.</p>
<p>(ii) The Trial Judge&#146;s Third Ruling</p>
<p>
  [130] As I have already concluded that a new trial is required as a result of 
  the improper admission of certain of the similar fact evidence tendered by the 
  Crown, it is unnecessary to address all of the remaining grounds of appeal raised 
  by the appellant. One of those grounds, however, concerns the admission of additional 
  similar fact evidence under the trial judge&#146;s third ruling. For that reason, 
  I will comment on it briefly.</p>
<p>[131] In his second ruling on the similar fact evidence, the trial judge precluded 
  the Crown from leading evidence that the appellant shot someone during the St. 
  Thomas robbery. The trial judge based his ruling on his view that the remainder 
  of the admitted similar fact evidence was sufficient to permit the Crown to 
  assert an alleged pattern of criminal conduct by the appellant. The trial judge 
  also concluded that the prejudicial effect of the proposed additional evidence 
  outweighed its probative value. Consequently, it was excluded.</p>
<p>[132] The second ruling was made before the Crown called any evidence at trial. 
  It is not disputed that, at that time, no indication had been given by the defence 
  of its theory that Thompson, rather than the appellant, was or could have been 
  both a perpetrator in, and the shooter during, the events at Gagnons. </p>
<p>[133] The evidence established that Thompson was an accomplished marksman and 
  gun enthusiast, as well as an active hunter and member of a gun club, and a 
  competitive marksman. He had worked in the sporting goods industry for many 
  years. Three handguns and a large assortment of ammunition for various firearms, 
  including the same type of ammunition that was recovered at Gagnons, were seized 
  from his home following his arrest on March 10, 1995. </p>
<p>[134] The Crown argued that this evidence, much of it elicited or emphasized 
  by the defence, demonstrated that the jury was being asked by the defence to 
  infer that Thompson was more likely than not to be the Gagnons shooter. As a 
  result, the probative value of the evidence excluded under the second ruling 
  had assumed a fundamentally different character during the course of the trial. 
  Accordingly, trial counsel for the Crown requested that the trial judge reverse 
  his second ruling, to permit the reception of the additional evidence, &#147;[B]ecause 
  the defence has been put in a focus that did not exist at the time of the [second] 
  ruling.&#148; The trial judge agreed. He stated: </p>
<p class="indent">[I] am of the view that given that that is the position of the defence that 
  Deryck Thompson could indeed be the second person in Gagnon Sports Store, in 
  my view, does change the situation [sic]. I have reconsidered it with respect 
  to the additional evidence that has been put forward forcefully in that regard. 
  I am satisfied that it does go to the issue of identification, specifically 
  as it is compared now to the evidence of Deryck Thompson. I am satisfied that 
  that portion of the evidence can now be adduced that indeed the person was shot 
  in the leg. I say that because it is an issue of identification and it does 
  show the difference of the respective conduct in the grocery store with respect 
  to [the appellant] and the others that were present at the time. I am satisfied, 
  therefore, that the added evidence that I have heard, in totality, allows that 
  that portion of the evidence can now be put forward.</p>
<p>[135] The appellant&#146;s counsel properly concedes that the trial judge was 
  entitled to revisit his second ruling during the course of the trial. She argues, 
  however, that the trial judge erred in concluding that the probative value of 
  the proposed additional evidence (that the appellant shot someone during the 
  course of the St. Thomas robbery) had been strengthened during the trial. She 
  asserts that the defence theory of an alternate suspect was not based on any 
  evidence of Thompson&#146;s propensity and, accordingly, the highly prejudicial 
  effect of the additional evidence continued to outweigh its probative value. 
  I disagree.</p>
<p>[136] In R. v. Parsons (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 226 (Ont. C.A.), Finlayson J.A. 
  addressed the propriety of propensity evidence by the Crown to counter a defence 
  raised by the accused based on the alleged propensity of another person. He 
  said at pp. 237-38: </p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion, Mercier J. was correct in ruling that if the evidence relating 
  to Miller&#146;s propensity to commit robberies was introduced into evidence, 
  fairness dictated that the very similar evidence that the Crown possessed relating 
  to the appellant could also be introduced. I would go further and suggest that 
  if the appellant chose to throw sticks at Miller, the Crown should be able to 
  counter this evidence with any similar evidence relating to the propensity to 
  commit robbery, not only of the appellant, but of the other suspects arrested 
  with the appellant&#133;.To rule otherwise would leave the jury with the highly 
  misleading impression that Miller alone of those arrested had a propensity to 
  commit robberies, whereas in truth he was part of a gang that committed robberies 
  and the appellant was part of that gang [emphasis added].</p>
<p>See also R. v. Moore (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 281 (Ont. C.A.) at 284-85, per 
  curiam; R. v. Mullins-Johnson, (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 117 (Ont. C.A.) at 123-24, 
  per Catzman and Labrosse JJ.A.; and R. v. Bourguignon (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 
  43 at 56-7, per Moldaver J.A.</p>
<p>[137] In my view, given the evidence elicited during the trial from and regarding 
  Thompson and the defence strategy concerning an alternate suspect, the trial 
  judge correctly concluded that the additional evidence had become probative 
  of the critical issue of identification. As asserted by the Crown on this appeal, 
  at the time of the second ruling the evidence that the appellant shot someone 
  during the St. Thomas robbery was evidence of general propensity: it tended 
  to show that the appellant was the type of person likely to commit the charged 
  offences. By the time of the third ruling, the same evidence had become probative 
  of the identity of the shooter at Gagnons. </p>
<p>[138] The additional evidence concerning the appellant&#146;s conduct, the 
  truth of which he admitted, demonstrated that he had no hesitation in using 
  a firearm to shoot someone during a robbery. That evidence, in my opinion, was 
  admissible in the discretion of the trial judge to avoid leaving the jury with 
  the misleading or distorted impression that Thompson alone, in comparison to 
  the appellant, had sufficient familiarity, expertise and comfort with firearms 
  to render it more likely than not that he was the Gagnons shooter. Accordingly, 
  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>IV. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [139] For the reasons given, I would allow the appeal, set aside the convictions 
  and direct a new trial.</p>
