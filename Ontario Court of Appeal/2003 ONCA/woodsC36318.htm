<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice William A. Jenkins of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 9, 2001, reported at (2001) 145 O.A.C. 185.</p>    <P>
  MACPHERSON J.A.:</p>    <P>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>    
<P> [1] The respondent, Robert Woods, was seriously injured when he dove off a 
  groyne<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> into shallow water on Lake Huron. He fractured his 
  spine and was rendered a partial quadriplegic.</p>
<P>
  [2] Woods sued the City of Sarnia where the beach is located. Following a twelve 
  day trial, Justice W.A. Jenkins held that both Woods and the city were responsible 
  for Woods' injuries - Woods because he dove into water without knowing its depth, 
  and the city for failing to post a sign warning of the danger of diving off 
  the groyne. The trial judge apportioned liability between Woods and the city 
  on a 75:25 ratio.</p>    <P>
  [3] The city appeals from the judgment of the trial judge. It does not take 
  issue with the trial judge's statement of the governing principles of the law 
  of negligence. However, the city asserts that the trial judge made a crucial 
  factual error which infected his entire judgment.</p>    <P>
  [4] Woods concedes that the trial judge appears to have misstated a fact. However, 
  he contends that the error is meaningless when viewed in the context of the 
  trial judge's reasons read as a whole.</p>    <P>
  [5] The principal issue on the appeal is whether the trial judge's misstatement 
  of fact amounts to a &quot;palpable and overriding error&quot; warranting the 
  setting aside of his finding of liability on the part of the city: see Stein 
  v. The Ship &quot;Kathy K&quot;, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 802 at 808, and Housen v. Nikolaisen 
  (2002), 211 D.L.R. (4th) 577 at 584 91 (S.C.C.).</p>    <P>
  B. FACTS</p>    <P>
  (1) The parties and the events</p>    <P>
  [6] Robert Woods was born in Sarnia. When he was five, his family moved to the 
  United States. Fifteen years later, in September 1991, he moved back to Sarnia 
  with his mother and sisters.</p>    <P>
  [7] On May 12, 1992, Woods spent the afternoon working in the yard. The day 
  was warm and sunny. In late afternoon, he strolled to the nearby Kathleen Street 
  beach, a public beach in Sarnia.</p>    <P>
  [8] Woods had never swum in Lake Huron, nor climbed on a groyne. The groyne 
  at the Kathleen Street beach was somewhat dilapidated and rusting. It stretched 
  72.5 feet into the lake.</p>    <P>
  [9] Woods climbed onto the groyne and clambered to its end. He could not see 
  the bottom of the lake. Although he was an experienced swimmer and diver - indeed, 
  as a student he had practised with the high school diving team in Phoenix, Arizona 
  - and although he knew that it was dangerous to dive into waters of unknown 
  depth, he nevertheless dove off the groyne into the cold (about 50oF.) water 
  of Lake Huron. Unfortunately, the water was only three to four feet deep. Woods 
  hit his head on the bottom and fractured his spine. He is a partial quadriplegic.</p>    <P>
  (2) The litigation</p>    <P>
  [10] Woods, and associated Family Law Act plaintiffs, sued several defendants. 
  The action against all defendants except the City of Sarnia was dismissed on 
  consent before the trial commenced.</p>    <P>
  [11] The trial judge determined that the Kathleen Street beach and groyne were 
  within the City of Sarnia, which meant that the city was subject to the obligations 
  imposed on occupiers by the Occupiers' Liability Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O. 2. 
  Under the heading 'Liability', he framed &quot;the initial question&quot; as 
  &quot;whether the defendant, as the occupier of the premises, took such care 
  as in all of the circumstances was reasonable to see that persons were reasonably 
  safe while on its premises.&quot;</p>    <P>
  [12] The trial judge reviewed two &quot;diving cases&quot;: Kranabetter v. Kelowna 
  (City), (1987), 40 C.C.L.T. 292 (B.C.S.C.), aff'd (1988), 41 M.P.L.R. 195 (C.A.) 
  and Alchimowicz v. Schram, [1997] O.J. No. 135 (Gen. Div.), aff'd (1999), 116 
  O.A.C. 287, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused [1999] S.C.C.A. No. 127. He concluded 
  that &quot;the standard of care that is to be applied in these diving cases 
  . . . requires the occupier to protect against dangers that are sufficiently 
  probable that they should normally be foreseen.&quot;</p>    <P>
  [13] The trial judge concluded that the city did not meet that standard:</p>    
<P class="indent"> One of the dangers of diving off the groynes is the risk of 
  hitting bottom and suffering a neck injury, as occurred in this case. Since 
  I am satisfied that the defendant knew of that danger and that people were diving 
  off the Kathleen Street groyne, I find that it was negligent in failing to post 
  signs on the groyne warning the public of the danger of diving into shallow 
  water. [Emphasis added.]</p>    
<P>
  [14] Turning to the question of causation, the trial judge defined the issue 
  as &quot;whether a sign or signs would have prevented the plaintiff from diving 
  off the groyne on the day of the accident.&quot; He reviewed Woods' testimony 
  and the testimony of two experts who discussed the relationship between warning 
  signs and people's memory and conduct. He concluded:</p>    
<P class="indent"> Research into the effectiveness of warning signs is ongoing. 
  There is no doubt, however, that such signs have some effect. In this case a 
  warning sign may not have prevented the plaintiff from going into the water 
  but if he had been warned of the danger, I accept his evidence that he would 
  not have dived off the end of the groyne. Instead, he may have jumped off the 
  end of the groyne or retreated to the shore and entered the water from the beach. 
  In either case he would have avoided injuring himself. [Emphasis added.]</p>    
<P>
  [15] The trial judge then examined Woods' conduct on the day in question and 
  determined that Woods was negligent and contributed to his injuries.</p>    <P>
  [16] The trial judge concluded his reasons by apportioning liability between 
  Woods and the city on a 75:25 ratio.</p>    <P>
  [17] The City of Sarnia appeals the trial judge's decision. It seeks an order 
  absolving it of all liability for Woods' tragic accident.</p>    <P>
  [18] There are other facts relevant to the disposition of the appeal. I find 
  it convenient to mention them in the context of the specific issues to which 
  they relate.</p>    <P>
  C. ISSUES</p>    <P>
  [19] The issues on the appeal are:</p>    
<P class="indent"> (1) Did the trial judge err by concluding that the City of 
  Sarnia was required to post a warning sign at the Kathleen Street beach?</p>
<P class="indent">(2) Did the trial judge misapprehend the evidence about the 
  location of the warning signs at another beach in the City of Sarnia, and did 
  that misapprehension lead directly to an unwarranted finding of negligence on 
  the part of the city? </p>
<P class="indent">(3) Did the trial judge err by concluding that a warning sign 
  would have been effective in discouraging Woods from diving into the water?</p>
<P>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>    <P>
  (1) Was any warning sign required?</p>    <P>
  [20] The city contends that the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that 
  there was no duty on the city to post any kind of warning sign at the Kathleen 
  Street beach. The city points out that the accident took place on May 12, and 
  that the water temperature was quite cold. The city also submits that, as occupier, 
  it had no duty to warn of a danger which was so obvious that anyone would be 
  aware of it: see Alchimowicz v. Schram (1999), 116 O.A.C. 287 at 290. Diving 
  into unknown waters (Woods had never been swimming in Lake Huron), the city 
  submits, is obviously dangerous. The city argues that these facts, taken together, 
  establish that the trial judge erred when he concluded that it was foreseeable 
  that Woods might dive into the water off the groyne on May 12, 1992.</p>    <P>
  [21] I note that the city develops this argument in its factum under the rubric 
  Standard of Care. I agree with this characterization of the issue. In Housen 
  v. Nikolaisen, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada engaged in a comprehensive 
  discussion of the role of appellate courts in reviewing trial judgments in negligence 
  cases. It just so happens that Housen, like the present appeal, was a case dealing 
  with a municipality's duty to post a warning sign.</p>    <P>
  [22] With respect to the issue of standard of care, Iacobucci and Major JJ. 
  stated, at p. 596:</p>    
<P class="indent"> [I]t is settled law that the determination of whether or not 
  the standard of care was met by the defendant involves the application of a 
  legal standard to a set of facts, a question of mixed fact and law. This question 
  is subject to a standard of palpable and overriding error unless it is clear 
  that the trial judge made some extricable error in principle with respect to 
  the characterization of the standard or its application, in which case the error 
  may amount to an error of law.</p>    
<P>
  [23] The city does not quarrel with the trial judge's statement of the applicable 
  standard of care, which accords with the standard set out in s. 3(1) of the 
  Occupiers' Liability Act and the standard set out by this court in a diving 
  case, Alchimowicz v. Schram. Accordingly, the question is whether the trial 
  judge committed a palpable and overriding error in his appreciation of the facts 
  and in his application of the facts to the correct legal principle that he had 
  formulated. I do not see any such error in the trial judge's reasons.</p>    <P>
  [24] The trial judge noted that the Kathleen Street beach was a public breach, 
  adjacent to a road and easily accessible by stairs maintained by the city. The 
  city knew from its experience at a larger public beach at Canatara Park, where 
  lifeguards were engaged, that keeping people off the groynes was a continuous 
  problem. That is why warning signs were posted at that beach, no later than 
  1991. Moreover, based on the testimony of local residents Susan Woodhouse and 
  Wilfred Beauchamp, the city should have known that many people used the Kathleen 
  Street beach and that teenagers regularly jumped or dove off the groyne into 
  the water. Finally, the trial judge recorded that Mr. Beauchamp testified that 
  he had been in swimming as early as April when the weather was warm. The trial 
  judge observed that on May 12, 1992, it was a warm, sunny day and the lake was 
  calm.</p>    
<P> [25] Based on these facts, the trial judge concluded that it was foreseeable 
  that a person might dive off the groyne at the Kathleen Street beach, and that 
  the city was negligent in failing to post warning signs.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a></p>
<P>
  [26] I see no basis for interfering with the trial judge's conclusion on this 
  issue. He carefully reviewed the evidence and the submissions of both parties. 
  There was strong evidence supporting his analysis, and he was entitled to rely 
  on it and give it the weight he did. On this issue, there is not even a hint 
  of palpable and overriding error.</p>    <P>
  (2) The location of a warning sign</p>    <P>
  [27] This is the central issue on the appeal.</p>    <P>
  [28] The trial judge was candid in his statement of the city's negligence: &quot;I 
  find that it was negligent in failing to post signs on the groyne warning the 
  public of the danger of diving into shallow water.&quot;</p>    <P>
  [29] The city challenges the &quot;on the groyne&quot; component of this conclusion. 
  It contends that these words flow from a fundamental factual error made by the 
  trial judge relating to the location of warning signs at the main public beach 
  in Sarnia, and that this factual error caused the trial judge to make an improper 
  finding of negligence against the city.</p>    <P>
  [30] The main public beach in Sarnia was at Canatara Park. There were four groynes 
  on the beach. Lifeguards were on duty during the summer months. It is clear, 
  from the testimony of Eric Bogart, the senior lifeguard from 1992 to 1998, Pauline 
  Reaney, the head of aquatic programs for the city in 1992, and William Baird, 
  an engineer, that there were warning signs posted near the groynes from at least 
  1991 onwards. The signs posted near the groynes said: &quot;PLEASE KEEP OFF 
  THE GROYNE&quot;.</p>    <P>
  [31] The city contends that a focal point of the trial was the difference between 
  a warning sign posted near a danger and a warning sign posted on a danger. The 
  latter is called an interactive sign, and requires a person to take steps to 
  get around or over it. Accordingly, it is arguably more effective than a warning 
  sign placed near a danger.</p>    <P>
  [32] The city submits that the warning signs at the Canatara Park beach in 1992 
  were simple warning signs, not interactive signs. The city contends that the 
  trial judge misapprehended this fact, and that his factual error was a crucial 
  component of his conclusion concerning the city's negligence. The city points 
  to the final paragraph in the trial judge's reasons dealing with the city's 
  negligence:</p>    
<P class="indent"> It is clear that the defendant was aware of the effectiveness 
  of interactive signs as early as 1991 when it posted interactive &quot;Keep 
  Off&quot; signs on the groynes at Canatara Park. Those signs were mounted on 
  top of the groynes and in order to climb out on a groyne a swimmer had to step 
  over the warning sign. Although the &quot;Keep Off&quot; signs were not warning 
  signs, the defendant knew that it was dangerous to dive off the groynes and 
  that was one of the reasons it installed the signs. I, therefore, find that 
  the defendant was negligent in failing to post signs on the groynes in the Bright's 
  Grove area.</p>    
<P>
  [33] Woods concedes that the trial judge &quot;appears to err&quot; in this 
  passage. The interactive &quot;KEEP OFF&quot; signs on the groynes were installed 
  in 1996; in 1991, the &quot;PLEASE KEEP OFF THE GROYNE&quot; signs were probably 
  mounted on posts stuck in the sand adjacent to the groynes.</p>    <P>
  [34] The city contends that the trial judge's factual error in the above passage 
  is palpable and overriding because it feeds into the final sentence, the ultimate 
  conclusion, of the trial judge: &quot;I, therefore, find that the defendant 
  was negligent in failing to post signs on the groynes in the Bright's Grove 
  area.&quot;</p>    <P>
  [35] Although there is some force to the city's argument, in the end I am not 
  persuaded that the trial judge's error is a palpable and overriding one. I reach 
  this conclusion for several reasons.</p>    <P>
  [36] First, and most importantly, the trial judge's reasons, read as a whole 
  (and, in my view, they were thorough and thoughtful reasons by a very experienced 
  trial judge), establish that the central issue in the trial was whether there 
  was a duty on the city to post a warning sign at the Kathleen Street beach about 
  diving off the groyne. The location of the sign (near or on the groyne) was, 
  although not an invisible issue, a peripheral issue. This conclusion is supported, 
  in particular, by two features of the trial judge's reasons. First, the paragraph 
  in which the factual error is made is not found in the liability section of 
  his reasons; rather, it is in the causation section, where the trial judge is 
  considering the effect of the city's omission on Woods' conduct. The trial judge's 
  conclusion on the causation issue is made in the preceding paragraph where the 
  trial judge frames his analysis in terms of &quot;if he had been warned of the 
  danger&quot;, a formulation which does not mention the location of a sign. Second, 
  at the conclusion of his reasons in a section labelled 'judgment', where the 
  trial judge apportions liability on a 75:25 ratio, the trial judge states: &quot;Although 
  the defendant was negligent in failing to warn the plaintiff of the danger of 
  diving off the groyne, I find that the absence of a sign was a minor factor.&quot; 
  It seems to me that this sentence, which is almost the final word in an eighteen 
  page judgment, strongly suggests that it was the lack of any warning sign, not 
  the location and nature (interactive) of the sign, that anchored the trial judge's 
  finding of negligence.</p>    <P>
  [37] Second, the evidence which serves as the foundation for the city's argument 
  is, in my view, somewhat weak or inconsequential. On the last day of a twelve 
  day trial, William Baird, an engineer, was testifying for the city, principally 
  about the difficulties municipalities would have in maintaining warning signs 
  on groynes because of waves and ice. During his testimony, Baird was shown a 
  photocopy of a photograph that he had taken, by happenstance in August 1991, 
  of one of the groynes and &quot;PLEASE KEEP OFF THE GROYNE&quot; signs at the 
  Canatara Park beach. It is a very poor photograph. It is unclear from the photograph 
  if the sign was mounted on the groyne (interactive) or affixed to posts in the 
  sand very near the groyne.</p>    <P>
  [38] Importantly, the precise location of the sign was irrelevant to the city's 
  counsel as he posed questions to Baird:</p>    
<P class="indent"> Q. Now it's also been suggested that warning signs be placed 
  on or near the groynes . . near this groyne in particular.</p>
<P class="center">. . . . . </p>
<P class="indent">Q. Now what . . from an engineering standpoint, what issues 
  are there with respect to the placing of warning signs on groynes such as the 
  Kathleen Street groyne, or signs close to it?</p>
<P>
  [39] Indeed, the location of the 1991 signs at the Canatara Park beach was so 
  irrelevant to the city's case that its counsel never asked Baird where it was 
  located. The fact that it was located or, more accurately, likely was located 
  on posts set in the sand near the groyne emerged only in Baird's cross examination:</p>    <P class="indent">
  Q. Okay. Now the photograph you brought from 1991 . . and again it's difficult 
  to tell, and I gather you've seen the original?</p>    
<P class="indent"> A. Yes, it's in our files, yes.</p>
<P class="indent">Q. The sign that we see, that's the sign that's mounted on the 
  groyne?</p>
<P class="indent">A. I think it's two posts driven into the sand just adjacent 
  to the groyne.</p>
<P>
  [40] Third, I note that the warning sign on the Canatara Park beach in 1991 
  appears, from the photograph, to be a very large sign with a clear and blunt 
  message. Moreover, the sign appears to be right next to the groyne. Given that 
  the trial judge's concern in his reasons was about the need for a warning, and 
  specifically a warning about the dangers of diving, it is difficult to see that 
  it would have mattered to him whether the sign was right on, or immediately 
  adjacent to, the groyne.</p>    <P>
  [41] Fourth, in another place in his reasons, the trial judge referred to the 
  testimony of Dr. Albert Katz, a psychologist called by the city, who testified 
  that a &quot;no diving&quot; sign was generally ineffective unless the sign 
  was placed on the top of the groyne so that a person had to climb over it to 
  get to the end of the groyne. The trial judge then set out a lengthy passage 
  from Dr. Katz's expert report dealing with warning signs generally, and their 
  relationship to memory and conduct. The trial judge concluded, in language that 
  attached no significance to the location of a warning sign on the groyne:</p>    <P class="indent">
  Research into the effectiveness of warning signs is ongoing. There is no doubt, 
  however, that such signs have some effect. In this case a warning sign may not 
  have prevented the plaintiff from going into the water but if he had been warned 
  of the danger, I accept his evidence that he would not have dived off the end 
  of the groyne.</p>    <P>
  [42] In summary, although the trial judge probably erred when he stated that 
  there were warning signs on the groynes at the Canatara Park beach in 1991, 
  I do not think that factual error was central to his reasoning or result. It 
  was not a palpable and overriding error.</p>    <P>
  (3) A warning sign and causation</p>    <P>
  [43] The city contends that the trial judge erred by concluding that if a warning 
  sign had been posted Woods would not have dived off the groyne. There are two 
  components to the city's argument on this issue: (1) based on the expert testimony 
  and the testimony of Eric Bogart, the lifeguard, a warning sign would not have 
  dissuaded Woods; and (2) inconsistencies in Woods' testimony should have led 
  the trial judge to disbelieve his assertion that he would not have dived into 
  the water if he had seen a warning sign.</p>    <P>
  [44] I do not accept these submissions. There was a great deal of evidence from 
  several witnesses about the relationship between warning signs and people's 
  conduct. None of the testimony was to the effect that warning signs were meaningless. 
  Accordingly, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that &quot;such signs 
  have some effect&quot; and to proceed to a consideration of whether a warning 
  sign would have deterred Woods. On that question, the trial judge was fully 
  entitled to find Woods' testimony credible: see Fletcher v. Manitoba Public 
  Insurance Co., [1990] 3 S.C.R. 191 at 206. The alleged inconsistencies in Woods' 
  testimony are, in a word, trivial.</p>    <P>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>    <P>
