<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants appeal their convictions on eight charges arising from their 
  activities in relation to a scheme to sell shares of tickets in a Spanish lottery, 
  contrary to s. 206(1) (Counts 1 to 5) and s. 202(1) (Counts 6 to 8) of the Criminal 
  Code. Applying the Kienapple principle, the trial judge entered conditional 
  stays on all but Count 4 of the indictment. He imposed a fine of $100,000.00.</p>
<p>
  [2] The trial proceeded on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Facts, supplemented 
  by documentary exhibits and brief viva voce evidence. There is no legally significant 
  difference in the roles of the two corporate appellants in the conduct giving 
  rise to the charges. They were charged jointly. The appellants were involved 
  in the business of selling repackaged fractional shares in high-stakes, state-run 
  foreign lotteries to American consumers. </p>
<p>
  Convictions</p>
<p>
  [3] With respect to the convictions, the appellants submit that the trial judge 
  was in error in his disposition of the issues raised in this case. They are: 
  1) the &quot;Additional Element of Chance&quot; issue; 2) the &quot;Agents for 
  Buyer&quot; issue; 3) the &quot;Betting or Wagering&quot; issue; and 4) the 
  effect of s. 207(1)(h) of the Code. In detailed and thorough reasons, the trial 
  judge rejected the issues raised on behalf of the defence.</p>
<p>
  1. The &quot;Additional Element of Chance&quot; Issue</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellants argued that it was necessary that an accused introduce a 
  new element of chance in order to be found guilty under s. 206 of the Code. 
  In support of that proposition, the appellants relied essentially on the decision 
  of this court in R. v. Austin, [1979] O.J. No. 823 (C.A.) and R. v. Herger (1991), 
  4 O.R. (3d) 359 (C.A.). In rejecting this proposition, the trial judge analysed 
  those decisions and correctly distinguished them from the present case on the 
  basis of the differences in the charges and in the particulars of the charges 
  in those cases. He concluded that the present scheme came within the language 
  of s. 206 of the Code. </p>
<p>
  2. The &quot;Agents for Buyer&quot; Issue</p>
<p>
  [5] With respect to this issue, the appellants argued that their activities 
  should be characterized not as repacking and selling but as acting as agents 
  for buyers. The trial judge reviewed the relevant facts and properly rejected 
  this submission as being inconsistent with the facts of the case.</p>
<p>
  3. The &quot;Betting or Wagering&quot; Issue</p>
<p>
  [6] This issue related to the last three counts in the indictment. The trial 
  judge concluded that the agreement with purchasers to &quot;guarantee&quot; 
  a minimum win on some purchases was in fact a bet or wager between the appellants 
  and the purchasers in which both stood to win or lose and that it was intended 
  to be used &quot;in connection with betting on a game&quot; within the meaning 
  of s. 202(1) of the Code. In arriving at his conclusion, he relied on the decision 
  of this court in R. v. Herger. </p>
<p>
  4. The Effect of s. 207(1)(h) of the Code</p>
<p>
  [7] This last issue was whether the defence could resort to the exemption in 
  s. 207(1)(h) of the Code.</p>
<p>
  [8] The trial judge found that the activities of the appellants went well beyond 
  the narrow form of exemption contemplated by the section. More importantly, 
  he accepted the uncontradicted evidence of an expert witness on American law 
  to the effect that the activities of the appellants clearly violated the law 
  in the United States. Accordingly, the trial judge concluded that the Crown 
  had established that the exemption in s. 207(1)(h) was not available to the 
  appellants.</p>
<p>
  [9] We see no error in the conclusions reached by the trial judge on all four 
  issues raised in this case. We would dismiss the appeal as to conviction.</p>
<p>
  Sentence </p>
<p>
  [10] The trial judge concluded that the fine imposed reflected only a small 
  fraction of the total revenue generated by the appellants' scheme during the 
  six years covered in the indictment. We see no error in principle and no basis 
  to interfere. We would dismiss the appeal as to sentence.</p>
<p>Disposition</p>
<p>
  [11] For the reasons given, the appeals as to conviction and as to sentence 
  are both dismissed.</p>
