<p>On appeal from the judgments of Justice Johanne Lafrance Cardinal of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated April 8, 2002, reported at [2002] O.J. No. 1560, and 
  September 3, 2002.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Earl Wylie and Sandra Leclair lived together from 1985 to 2000. Although 
  they never married, their relationship was a long term, committed one. They 
  had two children, Kyle who was born in 1990 and Kelly who was born in 1994.</p>
<p>
  [2] The parties separated in November 2000, and in May 2001 Leclair moved in 
  with her new common law partner, Brian Boyd.</p>
<p>
  [3] The parties agreed to a shared custody arrangement. However, on many other 
  issues, including spousal and child support and division of property, the parties 
  were unable to reach an agreement. Accordingly, a three day trial took place 
  in March 2002 before Justice Johanne Lafrance Cardinal. In comprehensive reasons 
  released on April 8, 2002, the trial judge dealt with all outstanding issues. 
  In a supplementary endorsement released on September 3, 2002, she disposed of 
  the issue of costs.</p>
<p>
  [4] Wylie appeals from the trial judge's judgment on two matters: (1) the quantum 
  of child support; and (2) the quantum awarded to Leclair under the rubric of 
  unjust enrichment. Leclair cross appeals against the trial judge's costs order.</p>
<p>
  A. Wylie's appeal</p>
<p>
  (1) Child support</p>
<p>
  [5] The parties agreed to a joint custody regime. In fact, their arrangement 
  is a true joint custody regime - both children reside with their parents on 
  alternate weeks.</p>
<p>
  [6] Section 9 of the Child Support Guidelines, O. Reg. 391/97 (&quot;Guidelines&quot;), 
  provides that, in a shared custody situation, the amount of child support must 
  be determined by taking into account three factors: (1) the applicable table 
  amounts for each parent or spouse; (2) the increased costs of shared custody 
  arrangements; and (3) the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of 
  each parent or spouse and of the children for whom support is sought.</p>
<p>
  [7] The trial judge held that, based on the respective incomes of the parents 
  (both worked), the set off amount produced by the applicable Guidelines table 
  was $272; that is, Wylie had to pay Leclair $272 per month for the support of 
  Kyle and Kelly. On the appeal, the parties agree that this is the correct set 
  off amount under s. 9(a) of the Guidelines.</p>
<p>
  [8] The trial judge decided not to apply the set off amount of $272, which relates 
  to the first factor in s. 9 of the Guidelines. She was cognizant of all three 
  factors in s. 9 and, after identifying the set off amount of $272, continued: </p>
<p class="indent">
  S. 9 of the guidelines requires the Court to look at the facts of each specific 
  case and to exercise its discretion accordingly. Having regards to the circumstances 
  of this case, including the fact that the Court has reservations as to how the 
  parties could have afforded such a lifestyle, and the Court has reservations 
  as to how the husband could have accumulated the assets that he has on his income, 
  the Court will order child support in the amount of $400 per month for the support 
  of both children taking into consideration the shared parenting regime.</p>
<p>
  [9] With respect, I do not think this analysis and application of the second 
  and third factors of s. 9 of the Guidelines is supportable. The comments about 
  the couple's lifestyle and Wylie's assets are entirely speculative. Indeed, 
  the latter comment belies the careful analysis and conclusions reached by the 
  trial judge in resolving property issues elsewhere in her reasons. Counsel acknowledged 
  that there was no evidence of &quot;increased costs of shared custody arrangements&quot; 
  (the second factor in the Guidelines) for either parent.</p>
<p>
  [10] Since the trial judge's analysis and application of the second and third 
  factors in the Guidelines are not supportable, it follows that there was no 
  basis for departing from the set off amount which the parties acknowledged was 
  the sum of $272 per month.</p>
<p>
  (2) Unjust enrichment</p>
<p>
  [11] The trial judge held that Wylie was unjustly enriched by Leclair's domestic 
  services during their fifteen year relationship. Although Wylie initially appealed 
  this holding, during oral argument he conceded that some award under this rubric 
  was appropriate.</p>
<p>
  [12] The trial judge awarded Leclair $150,000 under this heading. Wylie contends 
  that this award was far too high and that a proper award would have been something 
  in the $35,000 $70,000 range. I agree.</p>
<p>
  [13] The trial judge correctly held that a monetary award, rather than a constructive 
  trust, was an appropriate remedy: see Peter v. Beblow, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 980. 
  She also held, again correctly, that the 'value received' approach should be 
  employed to calculate the monetary award: see Peter v. Beblow at 999 and Bell 
  v. Bailey (2001), 148 O.A.C. 333 at 341.</p>
<p>
  [14] Unfortunately, there is virtually nothing in the trial judge's reasons 
  to indicate that she applied the 'value received' approach to quantification. 
  On the contrary, both her reasons and her conclusion establish that the trial 
  judge was intent on attempting to provide an equalization of net family property 
  in the context of a relationship - common law - to which it did not apply. I 
  reach this conclusion for several reasons.</p>
<p>
  [15] First, the trial judge commenced her analysis of the division of property 
  issue by setting out the assets and liabilities of the parties at the commencement 
  of cohabitation and at separation. This is an exercise relevant to the equalization 
  of net family property, not to a 'value received' calculation in the context 
  of unjust enrichment.</p>
<p>
  [16] Second, at the outset of her legal analysis, the trial judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> In the Province of Ontario, the Family Law Act does not give 
  equal standing to common law spouses when it comes to property accumulated during 
  the years of cohabitation. The Act does not talk of an equalization of net family 
  properties, common law relationships are not viewed as partnerships as stated 
  in the preamble of the Act.</p>
<p class="indent">It is worth noting that our society has evolved drastically 
  in the last decade. We now talk of same sex benefits, of same sex spouses being 
  able to bring a claim for spousal support, of same sex spouses being able to 
  adopt children. The Income Tax Act, a federal statute, treats common law spouses 
  in the same manner as married spouses. They are deemed common law if they have 
  been living together for at least twelve continuous months. Common law spouses 
  are subject to the same income tax rules as married spouses ie: - designation 
  of principal residence, attribution rules, equivalent to spouse tax credit.</p>
<p class="indent">With respect to spousal support, the law does not treat a common 
  law relationship any differently than a marital relationship except that you 
  must have cohabitated continuously for a period of not less than 3 years before 
  you can bring such a claim. (S. 29 of the Family Law Act)</p>
<p class="indent">However, with regards to property issues and long term common 
  law relationships Parliament has not kept up with the times. Common law spouses 
  have been accepted in our society as spouses. Politicians may have a political 
  future even though they may be divorced and now live in a common law relationship. 
  In most cases common law relationships, to the outsider looking in, have the 
  same attributes as those relationships commenced with marital vows. There are 
  two income families, two car garages, PTA meetings, car pooling, mortgages, 
  pooling of incomes. However, at separation, common law spouses do not have the 
  protection of the Family Law Act. The preamble of the Family Law Act does not 
  protect them as it speaks of recognizing marriage as a form of partnership If 
  the assets are in one spouse's name, the other spouse must prove their claim, 
  their contribution, their entitlement. Parliament will have to address this 
  lacuna, in the interim however, the trial judges will have to continue interpreting 
  the common law spouses intentions and will have to inspect their investments, 
  their accumulated wealth, their enrichment, their corresponding deprivation 
  with a fine tooth comb. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [17] Based on this passage, it appears that the trial judge thought that Parliament's 
  failure to provide for equalization of net family property for common law spouses 
  was a &quot;lacuna&quot; in legislation that needed to be addressed. In my view, 
  these comments are significant in the context of this case. The trial judge 
  essentially awarded an equalization of net family property. These obiter comments 
  of the trial judge can be seen as informing her approach to the calculation 
  of her unjust enrichment award.</p>
<p>
  [18] In Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v. Walsh, 2002 SCC 83, the Supreme Court 
  of Canada upheld Nova Scotia's legislation that provides equalization to married 
  spouses but not to common law spouses. The court stated, at para. 54: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [The Nova Scotia legislation] is primarily directed at regulating the relationship 
  between the parties to the marriage itself; parties who, by marrying, must be 
  presumed to have a mutual intention to enter into an economic partnership. Unmarried 
  cohabitants, however, have not undertaken a similar unequivocal act. I cannot 
  accept that the decision to live together, without more, is sufficient to indicate 
  a positive intention to contribute to and share in each other's assets and liabilities. 
  It may very well be true that some, if not many, unmarried cohabitants have 
  agreed as between themselves to live as economic partners for the duration of 
  their relationship . . . . It does not necessarily follow, however, that these 
  same persons would agree to restrict their ability to deal with their own property 
  during the relationship or to share in all of the other's assets and liabilities 
  following the end of the relationship.</p>
<p>
  Accordingly, there is no presumption that the net family property of common 
  law spouses should be equalized upon breakdown of the relationship.</p>
<p>
  [19] Third, after stating at the outset that the 'value received' approach was 
  the applicable calculation method, the trial judge's reasons are silent on any 
  quantum meruit calculation. The value of the benefits that Leclair and Wylie 
  received from each other were not assessed or set off. A set off analysis would 
  have been particularly relevant in light of findings of the trial judge that 
  Leclair lived rent free for the duration of her fifteen year relationship with 
  Wylie and had made no contribution during the first three years of their relationship.</p>
<p>
  [20] Accordingly, I conclude that the trial judge erred in assessing Leclair's 
  damages based on principles relating to the equalization of net family property 
  rather than on a 'value received' basis.</p>
<p>
  [21] There remains the question of whether a new trial should be ordered on 
  this issue or whether this court should determine an appropriate amount for 
  unjust enrichment. In Bell v. Bailey, Osborne A.C.J.O. said, at p. 343: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Since I think that the evidence supports a narrower finding of unjust enrichment 
  than that made by the trial judge, and since it is accepted that a monetary 
  award is adequate in this case, there remains to be considered what adjusted 
  monetary reward is reasonable in the circumstances. One option is to order a 
  new trial to determine the appropriate monetary award. In my opinion, it would 
  not be in the interest of either party to order a new trial. Too much time and 
  money has already been invested in this dispute. I will therefore do my best 
  to determine what monetary award will reasonably remedy the unjust enrichment 
  I have found to exist.</p>
<p>
  [22] I agree with these observations and believe that a similar approach is 
  preferable in this appeal. I have reviewed the entire record of the trial proceeding. 
  In my view, the $150,000 awarded by the trial judge is far too high. In argument, 
  Wylie's counsel suggested a range of $35,000 to $70,000. On the basis of my 
  review of the record, I am inclined to think that the higher number in this 
  range reflects a fair assessment of quantum on the unjust enrichment issue. 
  Accordingly, I would award Leclair $70,000.</p>
<p>
  B. Leclair's cross appeal</p>
<p>
  [23] The parties were unable to agree on the costs of the trial. The trial judge 
  received submissions and released an endorsement on September 3, 2002 in which 
  she awarded no costs to either party.</p>
<p> [24] Although a decision of a trial judge on the issue of costs is entitled 
  to substantial deference, it is difficult to see any basis for not awarding 
  costs to Leclair. Rule 24 of the Family Law Rules, O. Reg. 114/99, creates a 
  presumption that a successful party is entitled to its costs in a family law 
  proceeding. The presumption can be rebutted if the successful party has behaved 
  unreasonably during the case or if success is divided. The trial judge did not 
  rely on either of these factors to support her rejection of the presumption. 
  Moreover, there is no doubt that Leclair was the successful party at the trial, 
  and that this characterization holds after the disposition of this appeal. She 
  obtained child support and a substantial payment for unjust enrichment, and 
  in amounts that exceeded Wylie's offer to settle. Accordingly, I am of the view 
  that the trial judge erred by not awarding costs to Leclair.</p>
<p>
  [25] I have reviewed Leclair's submissions on costs of the trial. Bearing in 
  mind that the custody issue was resolved before the trial, I would award Leclair 
  trial costs fixed at $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST, and in addition 
  to the costs award of $1,000 by Justice Blishen.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [26] I would allow the appeal, set the child support amount Wylie must pay to 
  Leclair at $272 per month, and order Wylie to pay Leclair $70,000 as compensation 
  for the domestic services she provided during their relationship.</p>
<p>
  [27] I would allow the cross appeal and order Wylie to pay Leclair trial costs 
  fixed at $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST, and in addition to the 
  costs award of $1,000 by Justice Blishen.</p>
<p>
  [28] Although both parties have been successful on the appeal and the cross 
  appeal, there is no doubt that Wylie has achieved the greater success. I would 
  award Wylie costs of the appeal fixed at $3,000, inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
