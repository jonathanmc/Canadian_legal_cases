<p>On appeal from a judgment of Justice Moira L. Caswell of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated December 12, 2001, reported at 56 O.R. (3d) 490.</p>
<p>MORDEN J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant, Wyndham Street Investments Inc., appeals from a judgment 
  of Caswell J. which declared that &#147;the proposed sale by the Corporation 
  of the City of Guelph to Barrel Works is not subject to Section 315 of the Municipal 
  Act [and that] the City is not required to comply with the provisions of Section. 
  315 of the Municipal Act and offer to sell the Section 315 lands to the abutting 
  owner, Wyndham Street Investments Inc.&#148;<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>. Caswell J.&#146;s 
  reasons are reported at 56 O.R. (3d) 490.</p>
<p>[2] As the wording of this order indicates, Wyndham asserted against the City 
  the right, under s. 315 of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, to have 
  the City offer to sell to Wyndham land that abuts property owned by Wyndham. 
  The City asserted, in opposition to Wyndham&#146;s position, that because the 
  land is in a &#147;redevelopment area&#148;, as defined in the Planning Act, 
  R.S.O. 1980, c. 379, s. 22(1)(b)<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a>, it is not obliged to offer 
  the land for sale to Wyndham, but is entitled to sell it, as part of a larger 
  parcel, to another corporation. </p>
<p>The Facts</p>
<p>[3] Before I set out the relevant statutory provisions, I shall set forth an 
  outline of the facts. They are conveniently set forth in the application judge&#146;s 
  reasons under the heading &#147;Agreed Facts&#148;, as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">1. The property involved in this application is a portion 
  of a stopped up or closed highway known as Quebec Street, which itself was part 
  of a large land assembly in the downtown area of the City of Guelph known as 
  the Gueph Eatons Centre in the early 1980&#146;s.</p>
<p class="indent">2. The area was developed first in 1980 under a Downtown 
  Revitalization Agreement between the City and the province pursuant to s. 22 
  and s. 24 of the Planning Act, 1980 whereby funds were provided by the province 
  to the City for the purpose of carrying out the City&#146;s redevelopment plans.</p>
<p class="indent">3. In order to establish the redevelopment area, the 
  City passed the necessary by-laws to amend the official plan and applied to 
  the Minister of Municipal Affairs for the requisite approvals, which were received.</p>
<p class="indent">4. The Downtown Revitalization Agreement refers to the 
  redevelopment plan made pursuant to s. 22 of the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1970. 
  It is agreed that the legislation referred to is, in fact, the Revised Statutes 
  of Ontario, 1980, and that the agreement is subject to this legislation.</p>
<p class="indent">5. Pursuant to the 1980 agreement, the City was required 
  to close certain public streets, including Quebec Street. The City followed 
  normal procedures and gave the appropriate notices to effect the closings.</p>
<p class="indent">6. The overall development scheme was that the City 
  would lease the lands to a company known as Chartwoods Developments Limited, 
  and it would be Chartwoods who would carry out the actual construction of the 
  shopping centre mall including building the Eatons department store as the anchor 
  store. The lease was for a period of 60 years to expire in 2042.</p>
<p class="indent">7. The Eatons store location has been redeveloped as 
  a sports and entertainment centre. The balance of the lands are the subject 
  of a proposed sale by the City to a company known as Barrel Works Limited (Barrel 
  Works). The closed up portion of Quebec Street now comprises part of the pedestrian 
  mall and part of the mall buildings themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">8. Over the years between 1984 and 1999, the ground 
  lease was assigned on several occasions. In 1998, Eatons was closed. In 1999, 
  REOCO Limited, the present assignee of the lease, surrendered the lease of the 
  Eatons store to the City and assigned the lease for the balance of the shopping 
  centre lands to Guelph Centre Property Group (GCOG). Ministry approval of the 
  interim agreement with GCOG was received. The lease to GCOG was always intended 
  as a stopgap measure; the long term intention being to sell the property. Any 
  further disposition of the lands would require further approval of the Minister 
  in accordance with the terms of the1980 agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">9. In 1999, there were expressions of interest shown 
  in the property by three different groups being: Southside Developments, Barrel 
  Works and M. Lesic, In Trust. The City entered into an agreement for sale with 
  Southside Developments in January 2001 and passed the requisite resolution on 
  January 22, 2001.</p>
<p class="indent">10. In 1996, Wyndham bought the property which abuts 
  the s. 315 lands on which was located a two storey building and proceeded to 
  build a third storey. At that time there was no issue concerning the s. 315 
  lands because there was no sale of these lands pending by the City. Wyndham 
  entered into negotiations with the City for easements and parking agreements 
  for the commercial and residential condominium units to be constructed.</p>
<p class="indent">11. On or about March or April 2001, Wyndham became 
  aware of a potential claim to the s. 315 lands after the City had agreed to 
  sell the balance of the shopping centre mall to Southside. The City has admitted 
  that the council resolution dated January 22, 2001 is a determination to sell 
  the lands within the meaning of s. 315 of the Municipal Act.</p>
<p class="indent">12. In June 2001, the Southside Developments Agreement 
  was terminated. In July 2001, the City invited the three original bidders to 
  update their bids and re-present their proposals. The City selected the Barrel 
  Works bid and entered into an agreement of purchase and sale on September 6, 
  2001. The agreement included a 90 day due diligence clause. On September 19, 
  2001, that clause was extended to 45 days after this court renders its decision 
  on this application.</p>
<p class="indent">13. Wyndham listed the Woolworth property for sale on 
  November 12, 2001 and the stopped up portion of the Quebec Street lands is not 
  part of the property that has been listed for sale.</p>
<p>The Relevant Statutory Provisions</p>
<p>[4] Section 315 of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45 provides, in part:</p>
<p class="indent">315. (1) Subject to sections 316 and 317, where a highway 
  or any part of a highway over which a municipality has jurisdiction has been 
  closed under this Act, the Registry Act or the Land Titles Act and the council 
  of the municipality determines to sell the land forming the highway or the part 
  of the highway so closed, the land shall be sold in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The council shall by by-law set the sale price of 
  the land to be sold and shall offer to sell it to the owner of the land abutting 
  the land to be sold and where,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) there are parcels of land abutting on opposite sides 
  of the land to be sold, the owner of each parcel has the right of first refusal 
  to purchase the land to its middle line;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) If a person entitled under subsection (2) to purchase 
  the land does not exercise the right to purchase within such period as may be 
  fixed by by-law, the municipality may sell the land that the person had the 
  right to purchase to any other person at the price set under subsection (2) 
  or at a greater price.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Where the municipality is unable to sell the land 
  at or above the sale price set under subsection (2), the council may set a lower 
  price under that subsection and this section applies to a sale at the lower 
  price.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) Where land is sold to an abutting owner under this 
  section, the sidelines of the parcels abutting the land to be sold shall be 
  extended to include the land to be sold in such manner as the council considers 
  fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>[5] The relevant parts of ss. 22 and 25 of the Planning Act, R.S.O., 1980 c. 
  379 provide:</p>
<p class="indent">22. (1) In this section,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) &#147;redevelopment&#148; means the planning or 
  replanning, design or redesign, resubdivision, clearance, development, reconstruction 
  and rehabilitation, or any of them, of a redevelopment area, and the provision 
  of such residential, commercial, industrial, public, recreational, institutional, 
  religious, charitable or other uses, buildings, works, improvements or facilities, 
  or spaces therefor, as may be appropriate or necessary;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) &#147;redevelopment area&#148; means an area within 
  a municipality, the redevelopment of which in the opinion of the council is 
  desirable because of age, dilapidation, overcrowding, faulty arrangement, unsuitability 
  of buildings or for any other reason;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) &#147;redevelopment plan&#148; means a general scheme, 
  including supporting maps and texts, approved by the Minister for the redevelopment 
  of a redevelopment area. </p>
<p class="indent">(2) The council of a municipality that has an official 
  plan in respect of land use may, with the approval of the Minister, by by-law 
  designate the whole or any part of an area covered by such an official plan 
  as a redevelopment area, and the redevelopment area shall not be altered or 
  dissolved without the approval of the Minister.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) When a by-law has been passed and approved under 
  subsection (2), the municipality, with the approval of the Minister, may,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) acquire land within the redevelopment area;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) hold land acquired before or after the passing of 
  the by-law within the redevelopment area; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) clear, grade or otherwise prepare the land for redevelopment.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">(8) For the purpose of carrying out the redevelopment 
  plan, the municipality, with the approval of the Minister, may,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) construct, repair, rehabilitate or improve buildings 
  on land acquired or held by it in the redevelopment area in conformity with 
  the redevelopment plan, and sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any such buildings 
  and the land appurtenant thereto;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any land acquired 
  or held by it in the redevelopment area to any person or governmental authority 
  for use in conformity with the redevelopment plan.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">25. The provisions of the Municipal Act apply to the 
  acquisition of land under this Act.</p>
<p>[6] Relating s. 22(3) to the facts of this case, it may be noted that Quebec 
  Street was acquired by the City before the passing of the by-law designating 
  the redevelopment plan, and that the Minister&#146;s approval covered the City&#146;s 
  holding of this land within the redevelopment area (s. 22(3)(b)). With respect 
  to s. 22(8)(b), the municipality is empowered to sell land acquired or held 
  by it within the redevelopment area.</p>
<p>The Application Judge&#146;s Reasons</p>
<p>[7] In her reasons, the application judge stated the issue before her as follows: 
  &#147;to determine whether the City&#146;s disposition of the lands within a 
  redevelopment area is subject only to the provisions of the Planning Act, R.S.O. 
  1980 or is also subject to the provisions of s. 315 of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 
  1980.&#148; She concluded that the disposition was subject only to the Planning 
  Act.</p>
<p>[8] She came to this conclusion on the general basis that &#147;s. 22 of the 
  Planning Act is the complete scheme governing all dealings with lands that are 
  specifically designated as located within a redevelopment area&#148; and on 
  the more specific ground that s. 25 of the Planning Act by negative implication 
  excludes the application of s. 315 of the Municipal Act.</p>
<p>[9] In my view, the &#147;complete scheme&#148; approach is an unsatisfactory 
  basis for the application judge&#146;s conclusion. It begs the question of whether 
  the relevant Planning Act sections can be properly interpreted as providing 
  for a scheme that is so exclusive that it negates the application of any other 
  law relating to dealings with land in a redevelopment area. I think that what 
  is really involved in this part of the case is the question of whether there 
  is a conflict between the Planning Act and the Municipal Act provisions and, 
  if so, which Act should prevail. I deal with this question later in these reasons.</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>Is there a negative implication in s. 25 of the Planning Act?</p>
<p>[10] I deal first with the negative implication that the application judge 
  drew from s. 25 of the Planning Act. She held that because this provision referred 
  only to &#147;the acquisition of land under this Act&#148; it should be read 
  as excluding other provisions of the Municipal Act, specifically, provisions 
  in it relating to the disposition of land, including s. 315. In this regard, 
  she said:</p>
<p class="indent">[17] There is no reference in either statute that the 
  provisions of the Municipal Act govern the disposition of lands under the Planning 
  Act [emphasis in original]. </p>
<p class="indent">[18] The logical approach is to consider that s. 25 
  applies only to the acquisition of lands and excludes the disposition of lands 
  within a redevelopment area. The apparent conflict concerning the acquisition 
  of lands is resolved on a careful reading of both s. 25 and s. 22(3)(a). The 
  operative words are &#147;within the redevelopment area&#148;. All other lands 
  which the City acquires are subject to the sections of the Municipal Act relating 
  to acquisitions. However, dispositions of land continue to be governed by the 
  Planning Act only. It is appropriate to apply in these circumstances the expressio 
  unius rule, since one would expect that dispositions would be dealt with as 
  well as acquisitions in the context of the Municipal Act. As R. Sullivan says 
  in Driedger, supra:</p>
<p class="indent15">Legislation is supposed to be drafted in a coherent 
  and orderly way. It thus follows from sound drafting practice that a partial 
  enumeration of like things is meant to be exhaustive, and anything left off 
  the list is by implication meant to be excluded.</p>
<p>[11] With great respect to the application judge, I do not think that s. 25 
  of the Planning Act gives rise to any negative implication.</p>
<p>[12] In concluding that the terms of s. 25 of the Planning Act exclude the 
  application of s. 315 of the Municipal Act, the application judge applied the 
  expressio unius est exclusio alterius maxim: &#147;to express one thing is to 
  exclude another.&#148; (R. Sullivan, Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction 
  of Statutes, 4th ed. (2002) at 186). In my view, the maxim is not capable of 
  supporting the application judge&#146;s conclusion.</p>
<p>[13] The most important consideration in determining the meaning of s. 25 is 
  its purpose, more specifically, its legal function. It is part of the City&#146;s 
  argument that:</p>
<p class="indent">in the absence of s. 25 of the 1980 Act, neither acquisitions 
  nor dispositions of land authorized under the Planning Act would be subject 
  to the provisions of the Municipal Act; any other interpretation would lead 
  to the absurd result of rendering section 25 wholly redundant. Accordingly, 
  it is only by virtue of section 25 of the Planning Act that the acquisition 
  of land under the Planning Act is rendered subject to the Municipal Act, and 
  in the absence of any reference in section 25 (or anywhere else in the Planning 
  Act for that matter) to a disposition of land, it must continue to be the case 
  that the Municipal Act does not apply [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>[14] I disagree with the submission that in the absence of s. 25, acquisitions 
  authorized under the Planning Act would not be subject to the provisions of 
  the Municipal Act. In this regard, I refer to ss. 5 and 191(1) of the Municipal 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, both of which have been in this Act for decades.</p>
<p class="indent">5. Where power to acquire land is conferred upon a municipal 
  corporation by this or any other Act, unless otherwise expressly provided, it 
  includes the power to acquire by purchase or otherwise and to enter on and expropriate.</p>
<p class="indent">191(1) The council of every corporation may pass by-laws 
  for acquiring or expropriating any land required for the purposes of the corporation, 
  &#133;</p>
<p>[15] It may be seen from s. 5 that not only is s. 25 of the Planning Act not 
  necessary for a municipality to acquire land by expropriation under s. 22(3) 
  of the Planning Act but, indeed, that an express statutory provision would be 
  required to exclude the power of expropriation of land under this provision. 
  With respect to s. 191(1), no doubt &#147;the purposes of the corporation&#148; 
  include acquiring land for a redevelopment plan under s. 22 of the Planning 
  Act.</p>
<p>[16] Having regard to this context, what is the function of s. 25? While it 
  is redundant from a strictly legal point of view, it serves the practical purpose 
  of bringing to the attention of the reader that the Municipal Act&#146;s land 
  acquisition provisions are applicable to the acquisition of land under the Planning 
  Act. It is a form of convenient cross-referencing to the relevant provisions 
  in the Municipal Act. It is an example of a common legislative technique. For 
  an example close to home in this case, see s. 111(2) of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. M.45 and s. 28(8) of the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13 both of 
  which make the same provision relating to the granting of bonuses by municipal 
  councils. See also, generally, R. Sullivan, Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction 
  of Statutes, 4th ed. (2002) at 161-162 and F. Bennion, Statutory Interpretation, 
  4th ed. (2002) at 993-94 with respect to the use of deliberate redundancy.</p>
<p>[17] In light of the above, it would be flatly inconsistent with the purpose 
  of s. 25 to read into s. 25 the negative implication contended by the City. 
  If s. 25 were not in the Planning Act, the overall legal position would be the 
  same. The City would have the power to purchase or expropriate land for a redevelopment 
  plan. In these circumstances, the City could not argue that the Planning Act 
  contained a provision that implicitly excluded the disposition provisions in 
  the Municipal Act. A legislative provision intended only to assist in the reading 
  of a statute cannot have such far-reaching consequences. I conclude that s. 
  25 does not exclude the operative effect of s. 315 of the Municipal Act.</p>
<p>The Issue of Conflict between the Planning Act and the Municipal Act </p>
<p>[18] I begin with a reference to s. 71 of the Planning Act, which provides:</p>
<p class="indent">71. In the event of conflict between the provisions 
  of this and any other general or special Act, the provisions of this Act prevail.</p>
<p>[19] For this provision to govern, there would have to be a conflict between 
  s. 315 of the Municipal Act and s. 22(8)(b) of the Planning Act. The test for 
  determining whether a conflict exists is stringent. I refer to the following 
  passage in R. Sullivan, Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, 
  4th ed. (2002) at 265:</p>
<p class="indent">The courts do not resort to the conflicts avoidance strategies at their disposal 
  unless there is a genuine conflict. For this purpose, conflict is narrowly defined. 
  In Tabernacle Permanent Building Society v. Knight [[1892] A.C. 298 at 302 (H.L.)], 
  Lord Halsbury said that so long as the Acts under review can &#147;stand together 
  and both operate without either interfering with the other&#148;, there was 
  no inconsistency or conflict. In Toronto Railway Co. v. Paget [(1909), 42 S.C.R. 
  488 at 499], Anglin J. said:</p>
<p class="indent15">It is not enough to exclude the application of the general Act that it deals 
  somewhat differently with the same subject-matter. It is not &#147;inconsistent&#148; 
  unless the two provisions cannot stand together.</p>
<p class="indent">In Friends of Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport) [[1992] 
  1 S.C.R. 3 at 38-39], La Forest J. noted the similarity between this approach 
  and defining conflict in the constitutional law context:</p>
<p class="indent15">There is also some doctrinal similarity to the principle of paramountcy in 
  constitutional division of powers cases where inconsistency has also been defined 
  in terms of contradiction &#150; i.e., &#147;compliance with one law involves 
  breach of the other&#148;; see Smith v. The Queen [[1960] S.C.R. 776 at 800].</p>
<p>[20] I think that the circumstances of this case give rise to a conflict. Section 
  315 of the Municipal Act and s. 22(8)(b) of the Planning Act cannot &#147;stand 
  together&#148;. Compliance with one law involves a breach of the other. I accept 
  that the City had a duty to Wyndham to offer to sell the Quebec Street lands 
  to it under s. 315 in the event that it determined to sell these lands. However, 
  the power to sell these lands under s. 22(8)(b) (either separately or as part 
  of a larger parcel) was solely &#147;for use in conformity with the redevelopment 
  plan&#148;. Clearly implicit in this is the prohibition from selling for any 
  other purpose. The City cannot sell under s. 315 without contravening s. 22(8)(b).</p>
<p>[21] Wyndham has argued that the interest that it has under s. 315 is the same 
  as, or analogous to, that of the owner of an easement that crosses a parcel 
  of land to be sold under s. 22(8)(b). To give clear title to the purchasing 
  developer, the City would be required to deal with the owner of the easement 
  to obtain the release of its interest. Wyndham submits that it could not be 
  argued that the sale under s. 22(8)(b) would extinguish the easement and that 
  the same reasoning applies to Wyndham&#146;s s. 315 interest. </p>
<p>[22] With respect, the nature of Wyndham&#146;s potential interest in the land 
  is not analogous to that of the owner of an easement or of any other existing 
  interest in land. The very act which triggered Wyndham&#146;s submitted right 
  of first refusal was a determination to sell under s. 22(8)(b). If it is implicit 
  in s. 22(8)(b) that the City cannot sell for any purpose other than &#147;for 
  use in conformity with the development plan&#148;, as I have held, then it seems 
  to me that the terms of s. 22(8)(b) preclude a property right arising in Wyndham. 
</p>
<p>[23] The foregoing, I think, is sufficient to resolve the conflict issue. I 
  might add, however, that if s. 315 of the Municipal Act were given effect and 
  the Quebec Street lands were sold to Wyndham, the result would be a frustration 
  of the comprehensive redevelopment plan decided upon, with the approval of the 
  Minister, in the public interest. Wyndham has submitted that this result should 
  not be of concern because the City could then expropriate the Wyndham parcel 
  to return it into the redevelopment fold. I do not think that the possibility 
  of &#147;coopering up&#148; by this purely incidental and cumbersome process, 
  which would take place after s. 315 had had its effect, would reasonably enable 
  one to conclude that the intent of s. 22(8)(b) had not been frustrated.</p>
<p>Disposition</p>
<p>[24] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs including the 
  costs of the motion before Borins J.A. I would fix the costs of the motion at 
  $4000.00 and those of the appeal at $10,500.00, both inclusive of disbursements 
  and G.S.T.</p>

<P><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> This judgment was granted on December 
  12, 2001 on the application by the City under rule 14.05(3) of the Rules of 
  Civil Procedure. On the same date, Caswell J. made an order in an action commenced 
  against the City by Wyndham that stated that, in view of the judgment in the 
  application, it was &#147;neither necessary nor appropriate to deal with&#148; 
  a motion by Wyndham for leave to register a certificate of pending litigation 
  against the lands in question in both proceedings. Wyndham also appealed from 
  this order to this court and this appeal was formally before us on the hearing 
  of the appeal from the judgment made on the application. The order is clearly 
  interlocutory and not appealable to this court (Albert v. Spiegel (1993), 17 
  C.P.C. (3d) 90 (C.A.)) and the parties consented to an order quashing it, without 
  costs.</p>
<P><a name="2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a> Caswell J&#146;s reasons refer to the 
  relevant provisions in the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 379 and not to their 
  counterparts in the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 13. The redevelopment plan 
  in this case began in 1980. Section 74 of the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  P. 13 reads, in part:</p>
<p class="indent">74. (1) In this section, &#147;former Act&#148; means 
  the Planning Act, being chapter 379 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1980.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Despite the repeal of the former Act by section 
  73 of the Planning Act, 1983, being chapter 1, any matter or proceeding mentioned 
  in subsection (3) that was commenced under the former Act before the 1st day 
  of August, 1983, shall be continued and finally disposed of under the former 
  Act. </p>
<p class="indent">(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), a matter or 
  proceeding shall be deemed to have been commenced, in the case of,</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) redevelopment under section 22 of the former Act, 
  on the day the by-law designating the redevelopment area is passed;</p>
<p class="indent">There is no significant difference between the corresponding 
  provisions in R.S.O. 1980 and R.S.O. 1990 and, as did Caswell J., I shall, in 
  the main, refer to the R.S.O. 1980 provisions. In the R.S.O. 1990 version, which 
  originated in S.O. 1983, c. 1, the term &#147;community improvement&#148; replaces 
  &#147;redevelopment.&#148;</p>
