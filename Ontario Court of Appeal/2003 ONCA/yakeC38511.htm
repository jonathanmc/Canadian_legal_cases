<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The Corporation of the Town of Fort Erie appeals, with leave of this court, 
  from the decision of the Honourable Mr. Justice A.T. Lacavera, upholding the 
  decision of His Worship Justice of the Peace G. Radojcic acquitting the respondents 
  on a charge that they: </p>
<p class="indent">&#133; between the 5th of December 2000 and the 14th of February 2001 at 2268 
  Burger Road in the Town of Fort Erie, using land in an agricultural A-Zone for 
  use other than a permitted use, to wit, for storage of tires, being a use not 
  permitted by the Town of Fort Erie By-law 129-90.</p>
<p>[2] The uncontradicted evidence establishes that over a period of at least 
  three months (including most of December 2000 and January 2001), the respondents 
  accumulated thousands of used tires on their farm property with a view to eventually 
  using the tires, in unaltered form, as building material to construct fences 
  on their farm. It is common ground that the by-law in question forbids the storage 
  of used tires.</p>
<p>[3] The Justice of the Peace acquitted the respondents because in his view: </p>
<p class="indent">&#133; while these tires would be nominally in violation or the usage of these 
  tires would be nominally in violation during the period of time that they were 
  not in the fencing or corral structure, the clear intent from the testimony 
  of both Mr. Steffanson and the evidence before the Court is that at all times 
  these tires were there for the purpose of constructing this relatively novel 
  and perhaps unique and without commenting on the aesthetics of this technique 
  or technology use or fences and by having them there for that purpose, I find 
  that I have a doubt that there was the commission of the offence with respect 
  to s. 6.22 which has the prohibitive use definition as alluded and described 
  earlier in these reasons.</p>
<p>As indicated, the decision of the Justice of the Peace was upheld on appeal.</p>
<p>[4] In arriving at our conclusion that the acquittals cannot stand, we acknowledge 
  the evidence that some of the tires were being used as fencing during the timeframe 
  of the information. That said, we are respectfully of the view that the Justice 
  of the Peace and the Provincial Court Judge erred in focusing on the eventual 
  use to be made of the remaining tires, and failed to consider the situation 
  as it existed during the three months when they were being accumulated and piled 
  in a helter-skelter fashion on the respondents' property.</p>
<p>[5] Without attempting a precise definition of the word &quot;store&quot;, 
  on any definition of that word, we are satisfied that during the three-month 
  period in question, the respondents were storing tires on their property in 
  contravention of the relevant by-law and they should have been found guilty. 
  This is so regardless of the eventual use that was to be made of the tires and 
  whether that use was or was not lawful.</p>
<p>[6] In view of this conclusion, although we are inclined to the view that the 
  tires were no longer being &quot;stored&quot; within the meaning of the by-law 
  once they were in place and actually being used as fencing on the respondent's 
  farmland, we need not finally decide that issue.</p>
<p>[7] Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, set aside the verdicts of acquittal 
  and in their place enter convictions against both respondents.</p>
<p>[8] In oral argument, the parties agreed that in the event we were to set aside 
  the acquittals and substitute convictions, we should deal with the issue of 
  sentence. It was jointly submitted that the respondents should receive a nominal 
  fine in the amount of $100. We think that is an appropriate disposition and 
  accordingly the respondents will each be fined $50.</p>
