<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The moving party submits that the responding parties' appeal does not come 
  within s. 193(a) to (d) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and that, therefore, 
  their appeal lies only with leave. We disagree with this submission. </p>
<p>[2] We are satisfied that the responding parties' appeal comes within s. 193(c) 
  of the Act. The effect of the order appealed is to declare Clarica a creditor, 
  and if it is successful on the motion to set aside the proposal, to allow Clarica 
  to prove a claim in excess of $3 million. Thus, the property involved in the 
  appeal exceeds $10,000 within s. 193(c) of the Act. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the motion to quash is dismissed with costs to the responding 
  parties fixed in the agreed amount of $5,000, inclusive of disbursements and 
  G.S.T.</p>
