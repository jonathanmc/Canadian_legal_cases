<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The application judge erred in law in holding that title to the automobile 
  did not pass when Crown took possession of the vehicle and presented the cheque 
  which was subsequently dishonoured. There is no reason why the usual inference 
  that the parties intended title of the automobile to pass with possession should 
  not have been drawn. </p>
<p> [2] We agree with both counsel that the only real issue was whether the appellants 
  were innocent third party purchasers for value. Unfortunately, the application 
  judge did not decide that issue. We cannot decide it as it turns on contested 
  issues of fact on which there is conflicting evidence.</p>
<p> [3] The judgment below is set aside and we direct the trial of an issue to 
  resolve the issue in dispute as to whether the appellants were bona fide third 
  party purchasers. The appellants have agreed to place $15,000 in deposit with 
  Mr. Gottli to be held in trust pending the resolution of the trial of the issue. 
  Costs of these proceedings and the proceeding before Pitt J. are left to the 
  court trying the issue.</p>
