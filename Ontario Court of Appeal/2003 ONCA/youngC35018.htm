<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The trial judge imposed a total sentence of eleven years and also gave 
  the appellant credit of two years for pre-trial custody of seventeen months. 
  In our view, there is no error of principle in the sentence imposed and it is 
  not demonstrably unfit.</p>
<p> [2] The appellant abused and terrorized his common law spouse on an almost 
  daily basis for almost two years. The daily abuse was punctuated by several 
  specific events of unspeakable cruelty and horror. These included throwing the 
  victim from the second floor balcony; placing the victim in a freezer while 
  she was naked and sitting on the freezer so she could not escape; and sexually 
  abusing the victim in a series of sadistic and dehumanizing acts that went on 
  over many hours. </p>
<p> [3] The impact on the victim can hardly be overstated. She was so afraid of 
  the appellant that it took her years to go the police with her allegations despite 
  the fact that the appellant was in the penitentiary serving a sentence on another 
  charge. The victim will live in fear for the rest of either her life or the 
  appellant&#8217;s life.</p>
<p> [4] The trial judge said that there were no mitigating factors. We agree. 
  The appellant has a terrible criminal record. He is an alcoholic who is prone 
  to acts of violence while intoxicated. He has taken no steps to deal with his 
  problem and indeed, the appellant appears to have no real appreciation of the 
  danger he poses when drinking.</p>
<p> [5] There is evidence that he is in a relationship at the present, and to 
  date there is no evidence that the relationship is abusive. In our view, that 
  is not a mitigating factor. The relationship has not been a long one and the 
  appellant has spent a considerable part of that relationship in jail. In any 
  event, the fact that there is as yet no evidence that the appellant is abusing 
  his latest partner, pales beside his history of domestic abuse which includes 
  the abuse not only of this victim but of his previous domestic partner.</p>
<p> [6] The trial judge could have given slightly more credit than she did for 
  the pre-trial incarceration. We note that two months of the pre-trial incarceration 
  was spent in a hospital setting. However, in our view, even if she had given 
  perhaps five or six months more credit, the sentence of eleven years in addition 
  to the pre-trial incarceration was entirely appropriate.</p>
<p> [7] The appeal is dismissed.<br>
