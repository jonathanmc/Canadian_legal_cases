<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Susan G. Himel of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated October 25, 2001.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our opinion the trial judge made no error in her analysis of causation 
  or in her apportionment of liability. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant does not challenge the finding of fact by the trial judge 
  that the appellant's failure to hook up the high limit switch was a material 
  cause of the fire. The appellant submits that this is the only finding of negligence 
  made against it and that the trial judge made many more findings of negligence 
  against the respondent. The appellant further submits that the trial judge erred 
  in holding that these findings of negligence against the respondent only prolonged 
  or exacerbated the damage caused by the fire as opposed to being a material 
  cause of the fire. This submission ignores the trial judge's finding that the 
  defendants failed to warn or at least advise the respondent of problems in installing 
  the heaters and wiring according to the manufacturer's plans and specifications. 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] Apportionment of liability is primarily within the province of the trial 
  judge. There is no demonstrable error in the trial judge's appreciation of the 
  evidence or the law and there is no basis on which to interfere with her apportionment. 
  </p>
<p>
  [4] Accordingly the appeal is dismissed. Costs are fixed in the amount of $15,000 
  payable to the respondent. </p>
<p> Signed: &quot; R. M. McMurtry C.J.O."<br>
