<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Faye E. McWatt of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated February 13, 2002, reported at 58 O.R. (3d) 284.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] The Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.25, requires 
  that all motor vehicles being operated on a public highway in Ontario have automobile 
  insurance, including third party liability coverage, no fault statutory accident 
  benefits and uninsured motorist coverage.</p>
<p>
  [2] The Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.41 (the "MVAC 
  Act"), created a fund (the "Fund") which stands as the payor 
  of last resort of no fault accident benefits to persons injured in Ontario where 
  there is otherwise no access to coverage under a motor vehicle liability policy. 
  The Fund covers both Ontario residents and, in certain circumstances, non?residents 
  injured in motor vehicle accidents in Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [3] This appeal concerns the scope of the coverage provided by the Fund, namely: 
  in what circumstances can an Ontario resident injured in a motor vehicle in 
  a foreign jurisdiction obtain compensation from the Fund if her insurance in 
  the foreign jurisdiction does not cover the benefits she now seeks?</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  (1) The parties and the events</p>
<p>
  [4] The respondent, Bridget Young, grew up in Toronto, attended Trent University 
  in Peterborough, and returned to Toronto to work. In the early 1990s, she attended 
  a college and worked in California. In April 1995, she moved to Espanola, New 
  Mexico to work as a veterinary nurse.</p>
<p>
  [5] The respondent obtained a New Mexico driver's licence. She owned a 
  pick?up truck that was registered and insured in New Mexico. Her insurance, 
  from Clarendon National Insurance Company ("Clarendon"), provided 
  third party liability coverage and uninsured motorist coverage. The respondent 
  elected not to obtain first party medical coverage, which was optional.</p>
<p>
  [6] On February 10, 1996, the respondent was driving alone in Sante Fe, New 
  Mexico. Her pick?up truck flipped and rolled over. Sadly, the respondent suffered 
  catastrophic injuries that rendered her a quadriplegic.</p>
<p>
  [7] Through arrangements made by her family, the respondent was airlifted to 
  Toronto on April 15, 1996. She was hospitalized at Wellesley Hospital and later 
  at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Lyndhurst Clinic.</p>
<p>
  [8] The respondent was without recourse against Clarendon for the no fault statutory 
  benefits provided to persons injured in vehicle accidents in Ontario. These 
  benefits are set out in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule, O. Reg. 776/93 
  (the "Schedule"). On July 15, 1997, she made an application for 
  such benefits to the Fund.</p>
<p>
  [9] The application was denied on November 26, 1997 by the Minister of Finance 
  on two bases: (1) the Fund was not required to make any payment with respect 
  to motor vehicle accidents which occurred outside Ontario; and (2) the respondent 
  was not entitled to statutory accident benefits because she was not ordinarily 
  resident in Ontario when the accident occurred.</p>
<p>
  [10] The denial of benefits was mediated on April 8, 1998. The mediation failed.</p>
<p>
  (2) The litigation</p>
<p>
  [11] The respondent brought an action pursuant to s. 281 of the Insurance Act, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, seeking a declaration that she was entitled to the payment 
  of accident benefits from the Fund.</p>
<p>
  [12] The trial of the action took place before McWatt J. of the Superior Court 
  of Justice on December 4 and 5, 2001. The trial judge held that the respondent 
  was entitled to receive statutory accident benefits from the Fund.</p>
<p>
  [13] The trial judge addressed whether there was any touchstone between the 
  accident in New Mexico and the province of Ontario. She embarked upon this inquiry 
  because it would be inconceivable that Ontario's motor vehicle insurance 
  regime would respond to an accident that had no connection with Ontario, that 
  is, an accident that had no connection with Ontario's people, its vehicles 
  or its territory.</p>
<p>
  [14] The respondent's vehicle had been licensed and plated in New Mexico. 
  She had obtained car insurance in New Mexico. The accident occurred in New Mexico. 
  Hence neither the vehicle involved in the accident nor the place of the accident 
  had any connection with Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [15] That left the respondent herself. The trial judge turned to the question 
  of her ordinary residence. This issue arose because of s. 25 of the MVAC Act: </p>
<p class="indent"> 25.(1) In this section, "residence" shall be determined as 
  of the date of the motor vehicle accident as a result of which the damages are 
  claimed.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The Minister shall not pay out of the Fund any amount in 
  favour of a person who ordinarily resides outside of Ontario unless such person 
  resides in a jurisdiction in which recourse of a substantial similar character 
  to that provided by this Act is afforded to residents of Ontario . . . .</p>
<p>
  [16] It was common ground at the trial that New Mexico did not provide recourse 
  similar in nature to the Fund to residents in Ontario. Hence if the respondent 
  was a person who ordinarily resided outside of Ontario at the time of the accident, 
  she would have no claim against the Fund. Conversely, if she was not ordinarily 
  resident outside of Ontario at that time, a claim might be possible.</p>
<p>
  [17] After a thorough review of the case law and a careful analysis of the various 
  factors connecting the respondent to New Mexico and Ontario, the trial judge 
  determined that the respondent was not ordinarily resident outside of Ontario 
  when the accident took place. She concluded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  For the following reasons, I find that Ms. Young was not ordinarily resident 
  outside of Ontario at the time of the accident: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Ms. Young maintained an address at her parents' home 
  in Toronto where she returned to on occasion during her education in the U.S. 
  and where she returned to once she finished the first phase of her education 
  in the U.S. Most of her belongings, but for a suitcase full of possessions, 
  remained in her Ontario home. Her mail continued to be sent to that address 
  and she used the address when renewing her Canadian passport in 1995.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Ms. Young maintained her Canadian social insurance and had 
  a family doctor in Toronto whom she retained as her physician.</p>
<p class="indent">3. Ms. Young's sojourn in New Mexico which started in 
  April 1995 was part of her studies in veterinarian nursing. She lived as a guest 
  with Ms. Fields and her husband and moved only once they sold their home and 
  had no room for her in their new quarters. That move took place just before 
  the accident.</p>
<p class="indent">4. Ms. Young considered her internship in New Mexico as temporary, 
  reassessing its viability every six months. She was in her second six month 
  period when the accident occurred.</p>
<p class="indent">5. Ms. Young had no intention of giving up her residency in 
  Ontario while living in New Mexico to complete her education.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that the plaintiff filed no Canadian Income Tax returns 
  from 1990 to 1996 does not affect my findings. The fact that her OHIP coverage 
  and Ontario driver's licence had lapsed also does not affect my findings in 
  this regard.</p>
<p>
  [18] The trial judge then turned to the other issue in the case: could an Ontario 
  resident recover from the Fund for an accident which occurred outside Ontario? 
  At the heart of this issue were s. 6 of the MVAC Act and s. 268 of the Insurance 
  Act: </p>
<p class="indent">
  MVAC Act</p>
<p class="indent"> 6. (1) Any person who has recourse against the Fund for no?fault 
  benefits under section 268 of the Insurance Act may make application, in a form 
  prescribed by the Minister, for payment out of the Fund of the benefits.</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) If a person has recourse against the Fund under section 
  268 of the Insurance Act,</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) a reference to an insurer in the No?Fault Benefits Schedule 
  shall be deemed to be a reference to the fund and a reference to an insured 
  person shall be deemed to be a reference to the person who has recourse against 
  the Fund,</p>
<p class="indent"> Insurance Act</p>
<p class="indent"> 268.(1) Every contract evidenced by a motor vehicle liability 
  policy, including every such contract in force when the Statutory Accident Benefits 
  Schedule is made or amended, shall be deemed to provide for the statutory accident 
  benefits set out in the Schedule and any amendments to the Schedule, subject 
  to the terms, conditions, provisions, exclusions and limits set out in that 
  Schedule.</p>
<p class="indent"> . . . . .</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) The following rules apply for determining who is liable 
  to pay statutory accident benefits: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. In respect of an occupant of an automobile,</p>
<p class="indent"> i. the occupant has recourse against the insurer of an automobile 
  in respect of which the occupant is an insured,</p>
<p class="indent"> ii. if recovery is unavailable under subparagraph i, the occupant 
  has recourse against the insurer of the automobile in which he or she was an 
  occupant,</p>
<p class="indent"> iii. if recovery is unavailable under subparagraph i or ii, 
  the occupant has recourse against the insurer of any other automobile involved 
  in the incident from which the entitlement to statutory accident benefits arose,</p>
<p class="indent"> iv. if recovery is unavailable under subparagraph i, ii or 
  iii, the occupant has recourse against the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund.</p>
<p>
  [19] The trial judge interpreted these provisions in this fashion: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The legitimacy of Ms. Young's claim begins with a finding of legal liability 
  of the Fund through s. 268 of the Insurance Act. I find that s. 6(1) of the 
  MVAC Act clearly indicates that liability of the Fund to pay is created by s. 
  268 of the Insurance Act. Section 6(1) stipulates in what form an application 
  for payment from the Fund should be made. Section 6(2)(a) of the MVAC Act applies 
  to the facts of this case by providing that the Fund stands in the same position 
  as an insurer as far as the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule is concerned.</p>
<p class="indent"> There is no territorial limitation set out in s. 6 of the MVAC 
  Act. The Minister has provided me with little which could convince me that the 
  provision clearly limits payment from the Fund to victims of accidents occurring 
  in Ontario. The Minister contends that because there is a territorial limitation 
  set out in other sections of the Act, that I should read one into s. 6. I am 
  unable to find anything in the comprehensive reading of the legislation, including 
  the Insurance Act, which allows me to infer a territorial limitation for s. 
  6(1) of the MVAC Act.</p>
<p class="indent"> . . . . .</p>
<p class="indent"> I find that if the legislators who crafted the MVAC Act intended 
  that s. 6 have a territorial limitation to the Province of Ontario, they could 
  and would have included that limitation in the wording of that section. They 
  did not.</p>
<p>
  [20] The Minister of Finance appeals the trial judge's decision.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [21] The issues on appeal are: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Did the trial judge err by concluding that the respondent 
  was not ordinarily resident outside Ontario at the time of the accident?</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Did the trial judge err by concluding that the Fund was 
  available to Ontario residents injured in motor vehicle accidents that occurred 
  outside Ontario?</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) The respondent's &#8216;ordinary residence'</p>
<p>
  [22] The issue of the respondent's ordinary residence raises, in my view, 
  a question of mixed fact and law. The concept of &#8216;ordinary residence' 
  is well?known in many legal domains, including family law, tax law and conflict 
  of laws. It is therefore a legal concept. However, the application of this concept 
  in a particular case involves consideration of the relevant facts of the case. 
  It follows that the standard of review of the trial judge's determination 
  of this issue is the very high standard of "palpable and overriding error": 
  see Housen v. Nickolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at 262.</p>
<p>
  [23] The determination of a person's ordinary residence requires that 
  "all of the relevant factors are taken into consideration": see 
  Thomson v. Minister of National Revenue, [1946] 1 D.L.R. 689 at 707 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [24] The trial judge conducted a careful review of the relevant factors relating 
  to the respondent's intentions and activities. She noted that the respondent 
  filed no income tax returns in Canada from 1990 to 1996 and that her OHIP coverage 
  and Ontario driver's licence had lapsed. However, the trial judge found 
  that there were many factors which continued to connect the respondent to Ontario, 
  including maintaining an address at her parents' home in Toronto, leaving 
  most of her belongings there, using that address when she renewed her Canadian 
  passport, maintaining her Canadian social insurance, and retaining her Toronto 
  physician. The trial judge also accepted the respondent's testimony that 
  her travels to California and New Mexico were for study purposes only and that 
  she did not intend to give up her residence in Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [25] It is important to note that there is a crucial difference between actual 
  residence and ordinary residence. As expressed by Evans J.A. (dissenting, but 
  not on this point) in MacPherson v. MacPherson (1976), 13 O.R. (2d) 233 at 236 
  (C.A.): </p>
<p class="indent">
  [A] person may be ordinarily resident in a Province without being actually resident 
  therein. In my opinion, actual residence connotes a degree of physical presence, 
  not required to establish ordinary residence.</p>
<p>
  [26] There is no doubt that on February 10, 1996, the respondent's actual 
  residence was New Mexico. However, after her review of the case law and the 
  relevant facts, the trial judge concluded that the respondent was not ordinarily 
  resident outside of Ontario on that date. I can see no basis for concluding 
  that the trial judge's reasoning or resolution of this issue demonstrates 
  a palpable and overriding error.</p>
<p>
  (2) The availability of the Fund</p>
<p> [27] The trial judge linked s. 268(1) of the Insurance Act with s. 6 of the 
  MVAC Act (both set out above) and concluded that the Fund was available to compensate 
  the respondent for her accident in New Mexico. With respect, I disagree with 
  the trial judge's interpretation of both statutes in the circumstances of this 
  case. I do not think that the respondent's accident falls within the scope of 
  Ontario's motor vehicle insurance regime.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [28] Section 268(1) of the Insurance Act, contained within Part VI (Automobile 
  Insurance) of the Act, states that all motor vehicle liability policies are 
  deemed to provide for the statutory accident benefits set out in the Schedule. 
  Section 268(2) then sets out priority rules for determining who is liable to 
  pay the statutory benefits. The respondent asserts that she comes within s. 
  268(2)(iv): "if recovery is unavailable under subparagraph i, ii or iii, 
  the occupant has recourse against the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund."</p>
<p>
  [29] Importantly, Part VI of the Insurance Act does not apply to a contract 
  providing insurance in respect of an automobile not required to be registered 
  under the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8: see s. 226(2) of the Insurance 
  Act.</p>
<p>
  [30] The Highway Traffic Act requires all motor vehicles driven on a highway 
  in Ontario to be registered and plated in Ontario. Cars belonging to residents 
  of other Canadian provinces or of foreign countries are exempted from the requirement 
  of Ontario registration while being operated in Ontario, provided that the extraprovincial 
  or foreign vehicle is validly registered according to the laws of the jurisdiction 
  in which the person resides. However, extraprovincial or foreign vehicles must, 
  while being operated in Ontario, have the three mandatory insurance coverages 
  prescribed by the Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act.</p>
<p>
  [31] The respondent's vehicle did not need to be registered in Ontario. 
  Nor did the respondent's insurance policy need to comply with the mandatory 
  coverage provisions of the Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act. The respondent's 
  insurance policy could not be deemed by s. 268(1) of the Insurance Act to provide 
  for the statutory accident benefits set out in the Schedule. This is because 
  the respondent's vehicle was not being operated in Ontario. Moreover, 
  the respondent did not sustain injuries in a motor vehicle accident in Ontario. 
  It follows that Part VI of the Insurance Act, including s. 268, has no application 
  to the respondent or her vehicle.</p>
<p>
  [32] The only way in which the respondent could qualify for Ontario statutory 
  accident benefits for an accident in New Mexico would have been if she were 
  an insured person in respect of a particular motor vehicle liability policy 
  issued in Ontario. In other words, her recourse for the payment of Ontario statutory 
  benefits would have been contractual in nature. The respondent did not have 
  such a policy, nor was she an insured person on any other Ontario policy.</p>
<p> [33] For these reasons, I conclude that the respondent's accident does not 
  come within the scope of s. 268 of the Insurance Act.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  It follows that she also cannot access the Fund because entry to the Fund is 
  triggered, pursuant to s. 6(1) of the MVAC Act, only if a person "has recourse 
  against the Fund for no?fault benefits under section 268 of the Insurance Act". 
  The respondent has no such recourse.</p>
<p>E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [34] I would allow the appeal. The appellant does not seek costs of the trial 
  or the appeal. I would order that there be no costs of the trial or the appeal.</p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> After the trial judge&#8217;s decision

<p class="indent">6.(3.1) Subject to s. 6.1, no payment out of the Fund shall 
  be made in respect of statutory accident benefits if the accident from which 
  the entitlement to statutory accident benefits arose occurred outside Ontario.</p>
<p class="indent">The parties agree that, by virtue of ss. 17 and 18 of the Interpretation 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I. 11, this amendment has no bearing on the interpretation

<p><a name="2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a> I note that the trial judge supported 
  her conclusion on this issue by referring to and interpreting several specific 
  provisions of the Insurance Act, including ss. 224, 239 and 241. The respondent 
  concedes that these interpretations either referred to the wrong version of 
  these provisions, were in error or were, at their highest, unnecessary to her 
  conclusion. I agree with these concessions and do not propose to consider these 
  provisions.</p>
