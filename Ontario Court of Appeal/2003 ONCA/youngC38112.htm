<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Ian V.B. Nordheimer of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated March 14, 2002.</p> <p>
  GOUDGE J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] On March 14, 2002, Terrence Young and Gino Policicchio, each of whom had 
  commenced a proposed class action against the appellants, brought a motion before 
  Nordheimer J. seeking, inter alia, an order consolidating their actions and 
  allowing them to substitute Aline Boulanger for themselves as the representative 
  plaintiff in the consolidated action. The motions judge granted both orders.</p> <p>
  [2] The appellants have not challenged the first order but bring this appeal 
  from the second order permitting the substitution of a new representative plaintiff.</p> <p>
  [3] For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the order appealed from 
  is interlocutory and, therefore, that the appeal from it lies not to this court 
  but to the Divisional Court with leave. Thus, I would quash the appeal.</p> <p>
  [4] Broadly speaking, the statement of claim in the consolidated action seeks 
  damages arising from the production and distribution of the drug Prepulsid. 
  The causes of action pleaded include negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, breach 
  of warranty, and unjust enrichment, among others. The appellants have not yet 
  filed a defence, nor has a motion been brought to seek certification of the 
  action as a class proceeding. In other words, the action is at an early stage. 
  </p> <p>
  [5] The material filed before the motions judge indicated that Mr. Young and 
  Mr. Policicchio, as well as Ms. Boulanger, decided that their interests and 
  those of the other proposed class members would best be advanced by her assuming 
  the role of representative plaintiff for the class.</p> <p>
  [6] The respondents submit that the order substituting Ms. Boulanger as the 
  representative plaintiff is not a final order and, therefore, that this appeal 
  is not properly before this court.</p> <p>
  [7] The appellants argue that the order is final in that it is dispositive of 
  the participation of Mr. Young and Mr. Policicchio in the action as representative 
  plaintiffs. The appellants say that this order finally deprives them of the 
  automatic right to examine Mr. Young and Mr. Policicchio as representative plaintiffs 
  on the certification motion. </p> <p>
  [8] I do not agree with the appellants' position.</p> <p>
  [9] The order appealed from disposes of no substantive rights as between the 
  appellants and the respondents. This is not the same as removing parties from 
  an ordinary lawsuit. Mr. Young and Mr. Policicchio remain members of the proposed 
  class and all of the substantive rights to relief they may have against the 
  appellants continue to exist. Correspondingly, the appellants have lost no substantive 
  defences with respect to these individuals or any other members of the proposed 
  class as a result of this order. The order deals with a merely procedural matter, 
  namely who will be proposed as the representative of the class when, in due 
  course, a certification motion is brought. It does not deal with any substantive 
  merits of the action, as it must in order to be a final order. See Sun Life 
  Assurance Co. v. York Ridge Developments Ltd. (1998), 28 C.P.C. (4th) 16 at 
  20 (Ont. C.A.).</p> <p>
  [10] Furthermore, I do not think that in the circumstances of this case the 
  appellants can properly be said to have an automatic right to examine Mr. Young 
  and Mr. Policicchio which they have been deprived of by the order under appeal. 
  In Caputo v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd. (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 314 (Gen. Div.), Winkler 
  J. made clear that this is not an automatic right, but a matter for the court. 
  He put it this way at pp. 319-20:</p> 
<p class="indent"> In my view, the combination of s. 16(1) and rule 39.03 
  confers upon the defendants a right to examine a representative party on matters 
  relevant to the certification motion, in circumstances where there would otherwise 
  be an insufficient evidentiary record before the court for the determination 
  of the motion.</p> 
<p>
  [11] Moreover, until a certification motion is brought forward in which it is 
  sought to validate the plaintiff as properly representative of the class, the 
  &quot;right&quot; to examine the proposed representative plaintiff on this basis 
  does not arise. That point has not yet been reached in this case. The appellants' 
  &quot;right&quot; has not yet crystallized. In this sense as well the order 
  appealed from has not deprived the appellants of an automatic right.</p> <p>
  [12] The Supreme Court of Canada made clear in its decision in Hollick v. Toronto 
  (City), [2001] 3 S.C.R. 158 that courts should not adopt an overly restrictive 
  approach to the legislation governing class actions, particularly at the certification 
  stage. My view of the true impact of the order appealed from is consistent with 
  this approach It confirms my view that the order is merely procedural. It does 
  not even finally dispose of any absolute right to examine. The appeal must therefore 
  be quashed.</p> <p>
  [13] I would fix costs at $2,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
