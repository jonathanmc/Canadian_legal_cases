<p>On appeal from the committal order of Justice Frank K. Roberts of the Ontario 
  Court (General Division) (now Superior Court of Justice) dated September 3, 
  1998 and the application for a judicial review of the Minister of Justice. </p>
<p>GILLESE J.A.:</p>
<p>OVERVIEW</p>

<p>[1] The appellant, Esho Yousef, is alleged to have shot a Chicago man in August 
  1997 and then fled to Ontario. The United States seeks his extradition on a 
  first-degree murder charge. The extradition judge ordered the appellant committed 
  for surrender to the United States, having determined that the requesting state 
  established a prima facie case against Yousef. In making this determination, 
  the extradition judge relied almost entirely on a statement that Yousef gave 
  to two Chicago police detectives and an Illinois prosecutor who visited him 
  in December 1997 in a Toronto jail, where he was being held pending trial on 
  unrelated Canadian criminal charges. The statement was, in substance, a full 
  confession to the murder. </p>
<p>[2] Before interviewing Yousef, the American officials gave him the standard 
  &#147;Miranda&#148;<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> warnings required by 
  American constitutional law as a precondition to the admissibility of any statement 
  given by an in-custody suspect. However, those warnings did not fully comply 
  with the warnings required for admissibility of such statements in Canadian 
  courts pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
  The extradition judge rejected the argument that Yousef&#146;s statement was 
  obtained in violation of the Charter.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant brought a separate judicial review application against the 
  decision of the Minister of Justice to surrender him to the United States. However, 
  he has abandoned that proceeding because the Minister obtained an assurance 
  from the United States that the State of Illinois will neither seek nor impose 
  the death penalty against Yousef should he be surrendered. </p>
<p>[4] Before this court, the appellant renews his Charter arguments relating 
  to the admissibility of the statement. Assuming that the Charter does apply 
  in such circumstances, I would dismiss the appeal on the basis that the statement 
  was properly admitted under s. 24(2) of the Charter. </p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>[5] The following factual summary is based on the statement that Yousef gave 
  to the American investigators and the documents upon which the United States 
  relies in support of its extradition request. Yousef did not testify at the 
  extradition hearing or offer any contrary version of events. </p>
<p>[6] In August 1997, a man whom Yousef knew was involved in selling cocaine, 
  hired Yousef to act as his bodyguard. Yousef learned, from the man, that a &#147;well-dressed 
  guy&#148; was selling cocaine through a middleman named Ruben Loyola. The man, 
  whom Yousef refused to identify and who shall be referred to as Yousef&#146;s 
  employer, wanted to deal directly with the &#147;well-dressed guy&#148; and 
  decided to kill Loyola to achieve that result. </p>
<p>[7] On August 13, 1997, the employer drove Yousef to Loyola&#146;s apartment 
  building, handed him a handgun and instructed him to go inside and kill Loyola. 
  Yousef went to the apartment, with the loaded gun tucked in his waistband, and 
  rang the doorbell several times but no one answered. He returned to the employer&#146;s 
  car and handed back the gun. The two men drove off and the employer told Yousef 
  to &#147;forget about Ruben.&#148;</p>
<p>[8] The following afternoon, Yousef was at his girlfriend&#146;s apartment. 
  The employer visited him there and, as he left the apartment, said he would 
  be back later to talk to Yousef about Loyola. The employer returned later that 
  afternoon accompanied by Cesar Reyes. The employer said, &#147;Let&#146;s go 
  to Cesar&#146;s house, because Ruben is going to be there.&#148; The three men 
  drove (in two cars) to Reyes&#146; home. As Yousef left his employer&#146;s 
  vehicle, the employer said, &#147;Man, you gotta do this for me.&#148; Yousef 
  did not immediately know what the employer meant by this statement.</p>
<p>[9] Once inside the apartment, Reyes told Yousef &#147;We have to wait for 
  somebody &#150; they&#146;re gonna come to move a lot of cocaine.&#148; After 
  waiting for about a half hour, Yousef heard noises in the rear of Reyes&#146; 
  apartment. He walked to the laundry room, where the back door was located, and 
  saw Loyola. Reyes was standing behind Loyola.</p>
<p>[10] It was then that Yousef realized what his employer meant by the comment, 
  &#147;you gotta do this for me.&#148; The employer wanted Yousef and Reyes to 
  ambush and kill Loyola inside Reyes&#146; apartment. </p>
<p>[11] Reyes pulled a twelve-inch kitchen-type knife from a pile of laundry and 
  stabbed Loyola. Loyola screamed and Reyes tried to stab him several more times. 
  Then Reyes ran past Yousef toward the front door. Loyola tried to unlock the 
  back door to escape. </p>
<p>[12] Yousef had the same handgun that his employer had given him the day before. 
  This time, however, Reyes had given him the gun when the two of them arrived 
  at Reyes&#146; apartment. </p>
<p>[13] As Loyola attempted to escape, Yousef decided that he had to kill him. 
  He pulled the gun out of his waistband, aimed it at Loyola and pulled the trigger 
  but the weapon did not fire.</p>
<p>[14] Loyola then managed to get the back door open and ran outside screaming 
  for help. </p>
<p>[15] Yousef ran towards the front door but, before leaving the apartment, he 
  tested the gun to see whether it would fire. He pushed the gun against one of 
  the cushions on a couch in the front room and pulled the trigger. The gun discharged 
  into the cushion. Yousef then left the apartment to shoot Loyola whom he could 
  see standing in the rear yard of the house just to the north of Reyes&#146; 
  apartment building, talking on a cell phone. A man was standing next to Loyola, 
  near a barbecue. </p>
<p>[16] As Yousef approached Loyola, with the gun in his hand, Loyola jumped behind 
  the other man. The other man stated, &#147;I don&#146;t want no trouble.&#148; 
  Loyola said, &#147;You&#146;re not going to shoot me &#150; I&#146;ve got a 
  witness here with me.&#148;</p>
<p>[17] When Yousef was about three feet away from the two men, he pushed the 
  witness away and shot Loyola, hitting him in the stomach. As he got closer to 
  Loyola, Yousef kept firing; Loyola fell to his knees and grabbed at Yousef&#146;s 
  legs. Yousef shot Loyola once in the back of his head. When Loyola did not loosen 
  his grip, Yousef fired two more shots at the back of Loyola&#146;s head.</p>
<p>[18] The witness ran away. In a &#147;will-say&#148; portion of the prosecutor&#146;s 
  affidavit filed in these proceedings, the witness corroborates Yousef&#146;s 
  version of events.</p>
<p>[19] An autopsy report shows that Loyola died after receiving gunshot wounds 
  to the head, back, left arm and left shoulder. </p>
<p>[20] Chicago Police Detective Anthony Wojcik discovered Loyola&#146;s body. 
  There were eight .9 mm Luger cartridge cases nearby the body, along with a cell 
  phone. Inside Reyes&#146; apartment, Detective Wojcik found a .9 mm cartridge 
  case, a black-handled kitchen knife with blood on it and a cushion with a gunshot 
  hole through it. The police also found a large green duffle bag in the apartment 
  that contained cocaine and drug paraphernalia.</p>
<p>[21] After the shooting, Yousef ran back onto the street where he spied Reyes&#146; 
  car. He and Reyes drove toward Wisconsin. Yousef wrapped the gun in his shirt 
  and threw the weapon out the window. The two men called their employer and then 
  met with him in a Waukegan, Illinois mall. The three men drove to Racine, Wisconsin. 
  Yousef and his employer dropped off Reyes<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  and the employer took Yousef to a hotel in Niles, Illinois.</p>
<p>[22] The next day, the employer picked up Yousef at the hotel, handed him $600, 
  drove him to Union Station in Chicago and told him never to contact him. Yousef 
  fled to Canada, eventually making his way to Toronto where he was arrested and 
  charged with a number of Criminal Code offences. He was remanded to the Toronto 
  West Detention Centre.</p>
<p>THE STATEMENT</p>
<p>[23] On December 1, 1997, Chicago Detective Wojcik, Detective Daniel Engel 
  and Cook County prosecutor Patrick Kelly met with Yousef at the Toronto West 
  Detention Centre for more than four hours. </p>
<p>[24] A Metropolitan Toronto Police officer, Sylvie Parent, accompanied the 
  American investigators but did not participate in the questioning.</p>
<p>[25] Wojcik describes the visit in the following terms:</p>
<p class="indent">After we each introduced ourselves, Patrick Kelly told Yousif 
  that we were there to investigate the murder of Ruben Loyola &#133; . After 
  Patrick Kelly explained that he went on to recite Esho Yousif&#146;s rights, 
  pursuant to the United State&#146;s [sic] Constitution, which are commonly referred 
  to as the &#147;Miranda Rights.&#148; Patrick Kelly asked Yousif if he understood 
  that he had the right to remain silent and that anything Yousif said or did 
  could be used against him in a court of law. Yousif told us that he understood 
  that right. Kelly asked Yousif if he understood that he had the right to have 
  an attorney present with him during our questioning of him. Yousif told us that 
  he understood that right. Kelly went on and asked Yousif if he understood that 
  he had the right to stop the questioning at any time. Yousif told us that he 
  understood that right. Kelly asked Yousif if he understood that if he could 
  not afford a lawyer that he had a right to have a court appointed lawyer represent 
  him free of charge before any questioning. Yousif told us that he understood 
  that right. Finally, Kelly also advised Yousif that he would be extradited to 
  the United States and tried and sentenced under United States and Illinois law. 
  Yousif said that he understood that.</p>
<p class="indent">After Kelly had explained each of these rights to Yousif, Kelly 
  asked Yousif if he wanted to answer our questions and speak to us about the 
  fatal shooting of Ruben Loyola. Yousif said that he would speak to us. At that 
  time, the three of us had a conversation with Yousif. At the end of our conversation, 
  Kelly asked Yousif if he would like to have what he had told us transcribed 
  by a court reporter or written out by Kelly. Kelly explained to Yousif that 
  either way, he would be able to review his statement, make any corrections, 
  additions or changes to it and sign the final statement if he agreed with its 
  contents. Yousif said that he understood what a court reported statement was, 
  but that he wanted to have Kelly write out the statement and have the opportunity 
  to review it.</p>
<p class="indent">Patrick Kelly then prepared a sixteen (16) page handwritten 
  statement, which had various photo Exhibits A through H attached to it. Yousif 
  read a portion of the handwritten statement aloud to us to demonstrate that 
  he could read as he said he could. Yousif read along as Kelly read out the entire 
  statement to him. He also initialed various corrections, which were made to 
  the statement, along with the rest of us. Furthermore, Yousif signed each page 
  at the bottom, along with each of us and he also signed twice on page (1), after 
  his &#147;Miranda Rights,&#148; which appear typewritten on that page, had been 
  read out loud to him and after he again indicated that he understood them. He 
  also signed the back of the Statement Exhibits (A through H) and the front side 
  of the Polaroid photo of Cesar Reyes marked as Exhibit B along with the rest 
  of us. &#133;</p>

<p>[26] The typewritten Miranda statement referred to in the above passage reads 
  as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">I understand that I have the right to remain silent and that 
  anything I say can be used against me in a court of law. I understand that I 
  have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him present with me during questioning, 
  and if I cannot afford to hire a lawyer one will be appointed by the court to 
  represent me before any questioning. Understanding these rights, I wish to give 
  a statement.</p>
<p>[27] On December 2, 1997, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, issued 
  a warrant for Yousef&#146;s arrest for the murder of Ruben Loyola.</p>
<p>JUDGMENT BELOW</p>
<p>[28] The extradition judge determined, on the basis of Yousef&#146;s statement 
  taken at the Toronto detention centre, that the requesting state had made out 
  a prima facie case under the Extradition Act.<a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> 
  He held that the requesting state had proved that the person who allegedly committed 
  the crime in Chicago was Esho Yousef and that the alleged crime met the test 
  required for extradition.</p>
<p>[29] In admitting the statement, the extradition judge held that the persons 
  taking the statement were not Canadian actors and thus the Charter did not apply 
  to their actions. Alternatively, he held that the Miranda warning was in sufficient 
  compliance with the Charter to be admitted at an extradition hearing.</p>
<p>[30] He then ordered Yousef committed for surrender. </p>
<p>THE PARTIES&#146; POSITIONS </p>
<p>[31] At the extradition hearing and before this court, Yousef did not contest 
  that he voluntarily gave the statement to the American investigators. He asks 
  this court to rule the statement inadmissible, however, on the basis that the 
  Charter applied to his in-custody interrogation. The interrogation took place 
  while he was held in a Canadian jail, subject to Canadian criminal charges and 
  under the control of Canadian authorities. The investigators could not have 
  had access to him but for the permission and involvement of the jail superintendent 
  who had statutory duties for the management of the prison as well as the housing 
  and protection of inmates and the regulation of visitors.</p>
<p>[32] Yousef argues that his rights pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter were 
  breached due to the investigators&#146; failure to inform him that he had the 
  right to obtain immediate assistance from duty counsel and to access a lawyer 
  through a toll-free telephone service.</p>
<p>[33] The respondent argues that even if the American investigators could, in 
  these circumstances, be described as agents of Canadian authorities, it does 
  not necessarily follow that they were required to adhere to the same Charter 
  standards as those that apply to Canadian authorities. Alternatively, the respondent 
  argues that administration of the Miranda warning was sufficient to fulfill 
  the Charter requirements. Finally, the respondent argues that, in any event, 
  the statement is admissible pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.</p>
<p>ANALYSIS</p>
<p>[34] For the purpose of this appeal, I will assume that the Charter applied 
  to Yousef&#146;s interrogation and that Yousef&#146;s s. 10(b) rights were infringed.</p>
<p>[35] Section 24(2) of the Charter provides that:</p>
<p class="indent">24. (2) Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court 
  concludes that evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any 
  rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded 
  if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission 
  of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</p>
<p>[36] In R. v. Collins (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). the Supreme Court 
  of Canada set out the three factors that are relevant to a determination whether 
  evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2). These are the fairness of 
  the trial, the seriousness of the violation and the effect of excluding the 
  evidence on the administration of justice.</p>
<p>[37] The burden of persuasion on the question whether admission of the evidence 
  would tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute rests on the 
  party seeking exclusion of the evidence: Collin, supra.</p>
<p>[38] As Lamer C.J.C. noted in R. v. Bartle (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 315 
  (S.C.C.), the Crown also bears the burden of establishing that the appellant 
  would not have acted any differently had his s. 10(b) rights been fully respected 
  and that, as a consequence, the evidence would have been obtained irrespective 
  of the s. 10(b) breach. Lamer C.J.C. concluded, at 316:</p>
<p class="indent">Section 24(2) applicants thus do not bear the burden of proving 
  that they would have consulted counsel had their s. 10(b) rights not been infringed. 
  Of course, once there is positive evidence supporting the inference that an 
  accused person would not have acted any differently had his or her s. 10(b) 
  rights been fully respected, a s. 24(2) applicant who fails to provide evidence 
  that he or she would have acted differently (a matter clearly within his or 
  her particular knowledge) runs the risk that the evidence on the record will 
  be sufficient for the Crown to satisfy its legal burden (the burden of persuasion).</p>
<p>[39] In R. v. Harper, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 343, the Supreme Court of Canada considered 
  the admissibility of a statement made after a breach of s. 10(b). The appellant 
  in that case, on trial for assault causing bodily harm (domestic context), established 
  that he had been denied his informational right under s. 10(b) (duty counsel 
  and the 1-800 number). The appellant did not testify on the voir dire dealing 
  with the admissibility of his statement, which amounted to a confession. Nor 
  did the appellant tender any evidence showing that he would have contacted duty 
  counsel had he been informed of their existence and how to access the service.</p>
<p>[40] Lamer C.J.C. held that the Crown had discharged its burden to establish 
  that the police&#146;s failure to comply fully with the informational requirements 
  did not affect the appellant&#146;s behaviour. He found that the appellant &#147;had 
  an almost irresistible desire to confess&#148; even after being advised of his 
  right to counsel. Consequently, Lamer C.J.C., for the majority, concluded that 
  the incriminating statement would have been made even if the appellant&#146;s 
  s. 10(b) rights had not been violated. </p>
<p>[41] In this case, the appellant gave a complete confession after receiving 
  a full Miranda warning and after extensive efforts had been made to ensure that 
  he understood and had the opportunity to decide whether to exercise those rights. 
  There is nothing on the record to suggest that he would have acted differently 
  had he been provided with the full s. 10(b) warning. As was the case in Harper, 
  the appellant never testified nor did he tender any evidence showing that he 
  would have contacted duty counsel had he been informed of their existence and 
  how to access the service. There is similarly no evidence that the appellant 
  would have refused to speak to the investigators in the circumstances. </p>
<p>[42] In the circumstances, I have no difficulty in concluding that Yousef had 
  an &#147;almost irresistible desire to confess&#148;. Accordingly, I conclude 
  that admission of the statement into evidence did not render the extradition 
  hearing unfair. </p>
<p>[43] As to the seriousness of the breach, I conclude that the violation was 
  neither serious nor a flagrant breach of the appellant&#146;s rights. There 
  is no suggestion that the American investigators acted other than in good faith. 
  They took pains to inform Yousef of his American constitutional rights. It is 
  evident that they complied fully with the Miranda rules. The appellant does 
  not contest the voluntariness of the statement he made to the investigators. 
  There is no suggestion that he was in any way abused or coerced into making 
  the statement. The account of the interrogation was not challenged; that account 
  included the appellant telling the American investigators that he understood 
  his right to consult with counsel prior to any questioning and to have a lawyer 
  present with him during questioning. </p>
<p>[44] As to the third prong of the Collins test, I conclude that the admission 
  of the evidence at the extradition hearing would not bring the administration 
  of justice into disrepute. </p>
<p>[45] The seriousness of the offence with which the appellant is charged and 
  the reliability and importance of the evidence are relevant factors in determining 
  the effect on the administration of justice of the admission or exclusion of 
  the evidence. It need hardly be stated that murder is the most serious of all 
  crimes. The confession is very powerful evidence of Yousef&#146;s involvement 
  in the murder of Ruben Loyola. No question as to its reliability has been raised. 
  The American investigators complied fully with their obligations under the United 
  States Constitution. Canada has an international Treaty obligation to return 
  fugitives to the Untied States when that country establishes, among other things, 
  the conditions for a warrant of committal. There is a compelling public interest 
  in having this matter tried in the jurisdiction in which the crime was alleged 
  to have taken place.</p>
<p>[46] Accordingly, I am satisfied that the extradition judge did not err in 
  admitting the statement into evidence. </p>
<p>DISPOSITION </p>
<p>[47] For the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
