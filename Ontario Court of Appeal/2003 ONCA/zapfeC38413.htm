<p>On appeal from the order of Justice P.B. Hockin of the Superior Court of Justice
dated December 14, 2001.</p>
<p>FELDMAN AND CRONK JJ.A.: </p>
<p>[1] The appellant, Doris Zapfe, appeals from an order of Hockin J. of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated December 14, 2001 dismissing her motion to amend her 
  statement of claim to add two municipalities as party defendants in a negligence 
  action arising out of a motor vehicle accident. The primary question on this 
  appeal is whether the commencement of the three-month limitation period established 
  by s. 284(2) of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45 (the &quot;Act&quot;), 
  as amended, which concerns actions against municipalities for the non-repair 
  of highways, was postponed by the operation of the discoverability principle 
  until after the date of the appellant's amendment motion. In that event, the 
  appellant's proposed claims against the municipalities are not statute-barred. 
  If the limitation period had expired, however, the issue is whether the requested 
  pleadings amendment should have been permitted in the exercise of the court's 
  discretion under rules 5.04(2) and 26.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 
  1990, Reg. 194. </p>
<p>
  [2] For the reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal with leave to the
  respondents to plead the expiry of the limitation period under s. 284(2) of
  the Act. </p>
<p>
  I.	BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [3]	On January 5, 1999, the appellant's motor vehicle collided with a
  vehicle driven by Aileen Mary Barnes while Barnes was exiting a parking lot
  in Strathroy, Ontario. The appellant commenced an action in negligence against
  Barnes on December 22, 2000, claiming damages for personal injuries allegedly
  sustained by her in the accident. At the time of the issuance of her statement
  of claim, the appellant and her solicitor had no knowledge of the possible
  involvement in or responsibility for the accident of The Town of Strathroy
  ("Strathroy") or The Corporation of the County of Middlesex ("Middlesex"). </p>
<p>
  [4] Barnes delivered her statement of defence on March 29, 2001. She denied
  the appellant's claims and asserted that the appellant's own negligence
  was the cause of the accident. No mention was made in Barnes' statement
  of defence of the possible responsibility of third parties for the accident,
  or of the weather conditions at the time of the accident.</p>
<p>
  [5] Subsequently, on April 3, 2001, Barnes commenced third party proceedings
  against Strathroy (wrongly named, initially, as The Township of Strathroy-Caradoc)
  and The Royal Canadian Legion, Sir Arthur Currie Branch 116 (the "Legion").
  Barnes alleged in her third party claim that her view of the appellant's
  vehicle was obstructed by large piles of snow lining the perimeters of the
  parking lot and the adjacent roadway as she was attempting to leave the parking
  lot. She claimed that the parking lot was owned by the Legion, the snow was
  on lands occupied by Strathroy and the Legion, and they failed to properly
  maintain the roadway. She sought contribution and indemnity from the third
  parties for any sums for which she might be found liable to the appellant at
  trial, or which might be advanced to the appellant by way of settlement.</p>
<p>
  [6]	Barnes' third party claim was served on the appellant or her solicitor
  on or about April 3, 2001. </p>
<p>
  [7] On July 4, 2001, Barnes brought a motion seeking to amend her third party
  claim to add Middlesex as a third party. Barnes' supporting motion record
  contained a letter from her adjusters dated May 16, 2001 in which it was suggested
  that Middlesex was responsible for the roadway and that Strathroy was responsible
  for the adjacent sidewalks.</p>
<p>
  [8] On July 31, 2001, Barnes obtained an order permitting her to amend her
  third party claim to add Middlesex as a third party. Barnes alleged in her
  amended claim that Middlesex and/or Strathroy were negligent for failing to
  maintain the roadway by ensuring that the snow banks lining the street were
  reduced to such a level as to permit clear vision of the roadway by motorists.
  She further alleged that Middlesex was responsible for maintenance of the roadway
  and that Strathroy was responsible for maintenance of the sidewalks. Barnes
  also repeated her earlier allegation that her view of the roadway was obstructed
  by large piles of snow at the time of the accident. As a result, she sought
  contribution and indemnity from Strathroy, the Legion and Middlesex.</p>
<p>
  [9] On September 26, 2001, Strathroy delivered a defence to the third party
  claim and to the appellant's statement of claim. Middlesex followed suit
  on October 15, 2001. In those pleadings, the municipalities denied any negligence
  or responsibility for the accident. They also denied any knowledge of the condition
  of the roadway and the sidewalks at the time of the accident, including any
  knowledge of a snow build-up.</p>
<p>
  [10] On or about November 5, 2001,<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> the
  appellant brought a motion under Rules 5 and 26 of the Rules of Civil Procedure
  for an order amending her
    statement
  of claim to add the third parties as defendants in the main action. In her
  proposed amended pleading, she alleged that the two municipalities breached
  their duty to repair a highway by failing to remove the snow on the roadway
  and the sidewalks where the accident occurred. The appellant's motion
  was resisted by Strathroy and Middlesex on the basis that the applicable three-month
  limitation period under s. 284(2) of the Act<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> had expired.</p>
<p>
  [11]	The appellant's solicitor swore two affidavits in support of the
  appellant's amendment motion. In her affidavits, the solicitor, who is
  an experienced litigation counsel, explained why it was not possible for the
  appellant to discover with reasonable diligence the facts to form the basis
  of a cause of action against the municipalities before the examination for
  discovery of the proposed defendants in the third party proceeding. First,
  she stated that the appellant had no knowledge of the snow banks which Barnes
  alleged in her third party claim blocked her view and caused her to hit the
  appellant's car. Second, she said that she knows only the allegations
  made by Barnes, which are denied by the third parties in their pleadings. Further,
  because of the Rules of Civil Procedure, she asserted that she cannot obtain
  any information directly from the proposed parties except within the litigation
  process. Consequently, she has only Barnes' allegations, of which she
  learned only upon service of the third party claim, but no facts to substantiate
  those allegations.</p>
<p>
  [12]	The appellant's solicitor was not cross-examined on her affidavits;
  nor did the municipalities file any affidavit materials in response to her
  affidavits. Accordingly, the evidence of the appellant's solicitor is
  uncontradicted on the record before this court.</p>
<p>
  [13] No examinations for discovery have been held to date in the main action
  or in the third party proceeding.</p>
<p>
  II.	THE DECISION OF THE MOTIONS JUDGE</p>
<p>
  [14]	The appellant's motion was argued before Hockin J. of the Superior
  Court of Justice on December 14, 2001. For reasons dated June 3, 2002, the
  motions judge dismissed the motion in relation to Strathroy and Middlesex and
  granted the requested amendment concerning the Legion. The Legion did not appear
  on the motion and does not appear to have contested it.</p>
<p> [15] In dismissing the appellant's motion concerning the two municipalities, 
  the motions judge observed that the effect of the requested amendment, if granted, 
  would be to add Strathroy and Middlesex as party defendants after the expiry 
  of the applicable limitation period. In that regard, ss. 284(1), (1.1), (2) 
  and (5) of the Act provided at the relevant time: </p>
<p class="indent"> 284. (1) Every highway and every bridge shall be kept in repair 
  by the corporation the council of which has jurisdiction over it or upon which 
  the duty of repairing it is imposed by this Act and, in case of default, the 
  corporation, subject to the Negligence Act, is liable for all damages sustained 
  by any person by reason of such default.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) No action shall be brought against a corporation
    for the recovery of damages occasioned by such default, whether the want
  of repair was the result of nonfeasance
    or misfeasance, after the expiration of three months from the time when the
    damages were sustained.</p>
<p class="center">....</p>
<p class="indent">(5) No action shall be brought for the recovery of
    the damages mentioned in subsection (1) unless notice in writing of the claim
    and of the injury complained
    of has been served upon or sent by registered mail to the head or the clerk
    of the corporation, in the case of a county or township within ten days,
  and in the case of an urban municipality within seven days, after the happening
    of the injury, nor unless, where the claim is against two or more corporations
    jointly liable for the repair of the highway or bridge, the prescribed notice
  was given to each of them within the prescribed time.</p>
<p>
  III.	ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [16] There are two issues on this appeal: (i) has the commencement of the limitation
  period under s. 284(2) of the Act been postponed by the operation of the discoverability
  principle; and (ii) if the limitation period had expired by the date of the
  appellant's amendment motion, should the appellant's requested
  pleadings amendment nonetheless have been permitted in the exercise of the
  court's discretion?</p>
<p>
  IV.	ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1)	The Application of the Discoverability Principle</p>
<p>
  [17] It is common ground that the three-month limitation period under s. 284(2)
  of the Act applies to the claims sought to be advanced by the appellant against
  Strathroy and Middlesex. The limitation period expired naturally on April 5,
  1999, three months after the date of the accident, unless the discoverability
  principle operates to postpone the commencement of the limitation period to,
  at least, until after the appellant's motion to amend her statement of
  claim was brought at the beginning of November 2001.</p>
<p>
  [18] The discoverability principle was described by Justice Le Dain in Central
  Trust Co. v. Rafuse, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 147 at 224 in the following terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [A] cause of action arises for purposes of a limitation period when the material
  facts on which it is based have been discovered or ought to have been discovered
  by the plaintiff by the exercise of reasonable diligence.</p>
<p>
  See also Kamloops (City) v. Nielsen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2.</p>
<p>
  [19] The discoverability principle is an interpretive tool of general application
  which guides the interpretation of limitations statutes. Consideration of whether
  it applies in a given case is concerned with balancing fairness for both the
  plaintiff and the proposed defendant. On the one hand, the plaintiff, through
  no lack of diligence, is unaware of her cause of action prior to the natural
  expiry date of the limitation period. In those circumstances, the principle
  is designed to avoid the injustice of precluding an action or claim before
  the plaintiff is in a position to commence proceedings. On the other hand,
  the proposed defendant is entitled to reasonably rely upon limitations statutes
  in the ordering of its affairs. Application of the discoverability principle
  postpones the running of a limitation period and therefore precludes the proposed
  defendant from relying on the protection of the natural expiration of a limitation
  period: Peixeiro v. Haberman, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 549. See also Aguonie v. Galion
  Solid Waste Material Inc. (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.) and Consumers Glass
  Co. v. Foundation Co. of Canada (1985), 51 O.R. (2d) 385 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [20] The need for the balancing of those competing fairness concerns was confirmed
  by the Supreme Court of Canada in M. (K.) v. M. (H.), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6. In
  that case, La Forest J., writing for a majority of the court, described the
  policy reasons for statutory limitations of suits from the perspective of a
  potential defendant. They include: (i) recognition of the fact that there comes
  a time when a proposed defendant may reasonably expect that it will not be
  held to account for past obligations (at para. 22); (ii) the desirable objective
  of foreclosing claims based on stale evidence, that is, once a limitation period
  has expired, the potential defendant should be relieved from the need to preserve
  evidence relevant to the claim (at para. 23); and (iii) the important public
  benefit to be achieved by requiring plaintiffs to act diligently and not to "sleep
  on their rights", thus fostering the timely commencement of suits and
  closure of claims (at para. 24). At the same time, however, as observed by
  La Forest J. at para. 27, "[F]airness to the plaintiff must also animate
  a principled approach to determining the accrual of a cause of action."</p>
<p>
  [21] In Peixeiro, Major J. emphasized the requirement for fairness to plaintiffs,
  but also underscored their due diligence obligations (at para. 39): </p>
<p class="indent">
  In balancing the defendant's legitimate interest in respecting limitations
  periods and the interest of the plaintiffs, the fundamental unfairness of requiring
  a plaintiff to bring a cause of action before he could reasonably have discovered
  that he had a cause of action is a compelling consideration. The diligence
  rationale would not be undermined by the application of the discoverability
  principle as it still requires reasonable diligence by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>
  [22] It is not contested that the discoverability principle applies to s. 284(2)
  of the Act. The principle has been judicially recognized to apply to the limitation
  of actions against municipalities, including limitations established by the
  Act: Peixeiro, supra; Bannon v. Thunder Bay (City) (2002), 210 D.L.R. (4th)
  62 (S.C.C.); and Bisoukis v. Brampton (City) (1999), 180 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (Ont.
  C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 52. </p>
<p>
  [23] Rather, the appellant asserts here that the effect of the application
  of the discoverability principle is to postpone, to the date of the examinations
  for discovery, the commencement of the limitation period under s. 284(2) of
  the Act. In contrast, the respondents submit that application of the discoverability
  principle is irrelevant in this case because the appellant was aware of a potential
  cause of action as against Strathroy by April 1, 2001 (as a result of Barnes' original
  third party claim) and as against Middlesex by July 31, 2001 (when Barnes' third
  party claim was amended to include a claim against Middlesex).</p>
<p>
  (2)	The Postponement of the Limitation Period</p>
<p>
  [24] As appears from the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in Central
  Trust Co. and Peixeiro, the discoverability principle rests by definition on
  the requirement of due diligence by the plaintiff. Judicial respect for that
  requirement is inherent to proper regard for the diligence policy rationale
  which underlies limitations statutes. That requirement dictates the test to
  be applied in determining the start of a limitation period under the discoverability
  principle: when can it be said that the plaintiff knew, or by reasonable diligence
  could have discovered, the material facts on which to base a cause of action
  against the proposed defendant?</p>
<p>
  [25] The appellant advances two main arguments in support of her submission
  that the limitation period under s. 284(2) of the Act has not yet expired.</p>
<p>
  [26] First, the appellant relies on the decision of this court in Aguonie,
  supra, in support of her assertion that the determination of when a plaintiff
  acquired, or ought reasonably to have acquired, knowledge of the facts on which
  her claim is based is a question of fact which should be left for determination
  by a trial judge on a full evidentiary record. </p>
<p>
  [27] Second, the appellant submits that discovery of a tortfeasor involves
  more than ascertaining the identity of one who may be liable; rather, it also
  involves the determination of any acts or omissions which constitute liability.</p>
<p>
  [28]	In response, the respondents argue that the appellant's amendment
  motion was brought outside the three-month limitation period, on any view of
  the facts. They claim that regardless of which date is considered to be the
  date upon which the limitation period commenced to run, it has expired. More
  particularly, more than three months have expired from any of: (i) the date
  of the accident, which occurred on January 5, 1999; (ii) the appellant's
  receipt of Barnes' original third party claim on April 3, 2001; (iii)
  the appellant's receipt of Barnes' motion materials to add Middlesex
  as a third party on July 4, 2001; or (iv) the delivery to the appellant of
  Barnes' amended third party claim on July 31, 2001. Accordingly, even
  assuming that the appellant satisfied her due diligence requirement, the respondents
  submit that the prescription period has now expired and had expired by the
  time of the appellant's amendment motion.</p>
<p>
  [29]	On the record in this case, we agree with the appellant's position,
  for several reasons.</p>
<p>
  [30] First, it is not clear to us that the motions judge considered the discoverability
  principle, which was raised by the appellant as an issue on the amendment motion.
  The motions judge's analysis proceeded from the premise that the limitation
  period had expired. He went on to address the issues of prejudice and special
  circumstances in the context of the rules governing pleadings amendments. In
  doing so he stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The discovery process was never to be used as a tool to investigate possible
  causes of action. The plaintiff's obligation is to investigate and, if
  so advised, to commence proceedings, within time, against those who may have
  caused or contributed to the injury claimed by the plaintiff as a result of
  the accident.</p>
<p>
  [31]	While that statement properly recognized the appellant's due diligence
  obligation, it does not indicate that the motions judge related that obligation
  to the discoverability principle; nor do the reasons of the motions judge suggest
  that he assessed the evidentiary record before him in the context of the discoverability
  principle.</p>
<p>
  [32] Second, in Aguonie, the discoverability principle was held to apply to
  the identity of the tortfeasor and, in addition, to the acts or omissions of
  a potential tortfeasor identifying him or her as such. Justice Borins (ad hoc),
  writing on behalf of the court in Aguonie, stated at 170: </p>
<p class="indent">
  While it is true that many of the cases in which [the discoverability principle]
  has been applied concern a plaintiff's discovery of the extent of an
  injury, or the delayed effect or result of a defendant's negligence,
  this case concerns the discovery of a tortfeasor. The discovery of a tortfeasor
  involves more than the identity of one who may be liable. It involves the discovery
  of his or her acts, or omissions, which constitute liability [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [33]	Later in his reasons, Borins J. (ad hoc) said (at 172): </p>
<p class="indent">
  The starting point for the application of the discoverability rule&#8230;is
  the time when the appellants' cause of action arose. This will define
  the starting date of the limitation period. It is a question of fact when the
  cause of action arose and when the limitation period commenced. The application
  of the discoverability rule is premised on the finding of these facts: when
  the appellants learned they had a cause of action against the respondents;
  or, when, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, they ought to have
  learned they had a cause of action against the respondents. These facts constitute
  genuine issues for trial&#8230;[emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [34]	In this case, the appellant's solicitor provided an explanation
  for why she was unable to determine the facts about the alleged snow build-up
  in the relevant location on the day of the accident. That explanation was not
  challenged in any way by evidence from the respondents. In addition, there
  is no evidence before this court on what steps the appellant could have taken
  to attempt to substantiate Barnes' allegations prior to discovery and
  the production of documents in the litigation. Since both municipalities deny
  the facts asserted by Barnes, without an affidavit from them or cross-examination
  of the appellant's solicitor as to what inquiries could properly have
  been made outside the litigation process to substantiate or disprove the facts
  alleged by Barnes, there is no basis on the record for rejection of the evidence
  from the appellant's solicitor.</p>
<p>
  [35]	In most cases one would expect to find, as part of a solicitor's
  affidavit, a list of the attempts made by the solicitor to obtain information
  to substantiate the assertion that the party was reasonably diligent. In this
  case, however, the solicitor has explained why she could take no such steps.
  No information to the contrary was provided by the respondents. </p>
<p>
  [36]	On the record before us, therefore, the question of whether the appellant's
  solicitor was reasonably diligent cannot be answered with finality. The appellant
  herself claims that she had no knowledge of the snow banks. Therefore, everything
  within her knowledge is mere allegations by Barnes, denied by the third parties.
  Thus, a claim by the appellant against the municipalities at this stage rests
  only on bare allegations.</p>
<p>
  [37]	Whether the appellant's solicitor's explanation as to why
  no inquiries could be made prior to discoveries to substantiate or disprove
  Barnes' claims will survive scrutiny on cross-examination, or whether
  evidence exists that information was available to the appellant upon proper
  inquiry prior to her amendment motion to ground a cause of action against the
  respondents, cannot be determined at this stage. As observed by the Nova Scotia
  Court of Appeal in Burt v. LeLacheur (2000), 189 D.L.R. (4th) 193 at 207, the
  precise amount of knowledge necessary to trigger the running of time under
  a limitation period must be determined upon application of the legislation
  creating the limitation period, using the discoverability principle, to the
  facts as found. In this case, the crucial fact-finding exercise has not yet
  occurred and the appellant's asserted version of the facts concerning
  the discoverability of a cause of action against the municipalities was uncontradicted
  on the motion before the motions judge. Accordingly, the testing of the appellant's
  assertion that the limitation period has not yet commenced to run must await
  either a summary judgment motion or a trial.</p>
<p>
  [38] In our view, therefore, given the evidentiary record before the motions
  judge, this is a case where the municipalities should have been added as parties
  in the main action, with leave to the respondents to plead the limitation period. </p>
<p>
  (3)	Other Issues</p>
<p>
  [39]	Two additional matters bear mention in this case.</p>
<p>
  [40] First, the three-month limitation period under s. 284(2) of the Act is
  a prescription of very short duration. The length of that limitation period
  signifies the high value attached by the Legislature at the time of this accident
  to the control, and timely closure, of potential negligence actions against
  a municipality for the non-repair of highways or bridges. The duration of the
  limitation period suggests that judicial caution should be exercised in relieving
  against the limitation period. </p>
<p>
  [41] That interpretation is reinforced by s. 284(5) of the Act, which provides
  in part that no action shall be brought for the recovery of damages in connection
  with the non-repair by a municipal corporation of a highway or bridge unless
  written notice of the claim and of the injury complained of has been provided
  to the municipality within ten days (in the case of a county or township) or
  within seven days (in the case of an urban municipality) after the injury. </p>
<p>
  [42] Thus, s. 284 of the Act, as in force at the time of this accident, imposes
  two discrete limitations on the ability to sue a municipality in negligence
  for damages occasioned by the non-repair of a highway or bridge: (i) the three-month
  limitation period established by s. 284(2) for commencement of an action; and
  (ii) the provision for prior written notice of the claim and the alleged injury
  required under s. 284(5). Those statutory provisions, in combination, serve
  to underscore the requirement for diligence and timely action by a prospective
  plaintiff concerning such a claim. The respondents on this appeal, however,
  did not allege a breach by the appellant of s. 284(5); nor did the appellant
  claim compliance with it. In those circumstances, it is inappropriate to further
  comment on the significance of s. 284(5), if any, in this case.</p>
<p>
  [43] Second, before this court, the appellant argues that the reasoning underlying
  Rule 5.04(2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure is not applicable to the determination
  of her right to amend her statement of claim to add the respondents as party
  defendants. We disagree.</p>
<p>
  [44] A pleadings amendment to add a party to an existing action is governed
  by the Rules of Civil Procedure. In some cases, the relevant rules must be
  applied in the context of an amendment sought after the expiry of a limitation
  period. In other situations, the issue of the expiry of a limitation period
  does not arise. In no event, however, can the reasoning which supports the
  rules for pleadings amendments simply be ignored; nor are the rules displaced
  by the discoverability principle. </p>
<p>
  [45] In this case, the motions judge declined to grant the requested amendment
  following consideration of rules 26.01 and 5.04(2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.
  Those rules read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  5.04(2) At any stage of a proceeding the court may by order add, delete or
  substitute a party or correct the name of a party incorrectly named, on such
  terms as are just, unless prejudice would result that could not be compensated
  for by costs or an adjournment.</p>
<p class="center">
&#8230;
  .</p>
<p class="indent">
  26.01 On motion at any stage of an action the court shall grant leave to amend
  a pleading on such terms as are just, unless prejudice would result that could
  not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment.</p>
<p>
  [46] The motions judge considered rules 26.01 and 5.04(2) in the context of
  this court's recent decision in Mazzuca v. Silvercreek Pharmacy Ltd.
  (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 768 (C.A.). It is settled law that the courts retain a
  discretion to permit a pleadings amendment to change the parties to a proceeding,
  notwithstanding the expiry of a limitation period, if special circumstances
  justifying the amendment and the absence of non-compensable prejudice to the
  party opposing the amendment are demonstrated: Basarsky v. Quinlan (1971),
  24 D.L.R. (3d) 720 (S.C.C.); and Deaville v. Boegeman (1984), 48 O.R. (2d)
  725 (C.A.). Mazzuca confirmed that those principles apply to rules 5.04(2)
  and 26.01 under the current Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>
  [47] In this case, the motions judge proceeded on the basis that the applicable
  limitation period had expired. He did not expressly address the discoverability
  principle. Application of that principle, depending on the facts concerning
  the exercise of due diligence by the appellant, may result in the postponement
  of the commencement of the limitation period under s. 284(2) of the Act. Further,
  on the record before the motions judge, the appellant's solicitor's
  uncontradicted explanation concerning the inability to determine, prior to
  discoveries and productions, if material facts exist in support of a cause
  of action against the respondents was relevant to the exercise of the court's
  discretion under rules 5.04(2) and 26.01. It is not clear from the motions
  judge's reasons that her explanation was considered by him in the context
  of the discoverability principle. </p>
<p>
  V.	DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [48] For the reasons given, we would allow the appeal. The appellant is entitled
  to her costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis, fixed in the sum of
  $3,750.00, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services Tax.</p>
