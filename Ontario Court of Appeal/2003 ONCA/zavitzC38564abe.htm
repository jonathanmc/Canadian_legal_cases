<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree with the appellant that the evidence of Mr. Surowiak concerning 
  the walkway and its failure to meet the fire safety requirements of the Building 
  Code should not have been admitted. In our view, it was irrelevant.</p>
<p>[2] That said, we are satisfied that its admission occasioned no substantial 
  wrong or miscarriage of justice. The irrelevance of the impugned evidence would 
  have been apparent to the jury having regard to defence counsel's closing address 
  and the trial judge's charge, in which he questioned, at two points, the value 
  of that evidence and what it had to do with the case.</p>
<p>[3] Moreover, the position of the defence at trial was that the retaining wall 
  provided a safe means of access into the building and hence, the availability 
  of an alternate route via the walkway was at best, a marginal factor.</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed in the total amount 
  of $20,000.00.</p>
