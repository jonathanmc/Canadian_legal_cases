<p>On appeal from the order of Justice R. W. Pitt of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated November 5, 2002. </p>
<p>
  ABELLA J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The issue in this appeal is whether amendments made in 1997 to the Assessment 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. A. 31, affect the reimbursement of realty taxes payable 
  by the tenant to the landlord under a lease signed in 1975. </p>
<p>
  [2] The lease was between the landlord, The Orlando Realty Corporation Limited, 
  and S. S. Kresge Company, Limited, the predecessor tenant of Zellers Inc. The 
  rental premises were in a shopping mall. </p>
<p>
  [3] The provisions of the lease dealing with the payment of realty taxes are 
  found in Article 17. In particular, the following paragraphs of Article 17 are 
  germane: </p>
<p class="indent"> 17 [1] The Landlord shall pay when due all taxes, rates and 
  assessments whatsoever, whether municipal or parliamentary, including school 
  and local improvement rates, now or hereafter charged, assessed or levied against 
  or in respect of the lands and premises of the Shopping Centre, including Tenant's 
  building, subject however to Landlord's right to reimbursement by Tenant as 
  hereinafter provided, and provided further that Landlord may delay such payment 
  in the event such payment is the subject matter of a tax appeal in which event 
  payment shall be made when such appeal is determined.</p>
<p class="indent">[2] Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all taxes, rates and 
  assessments whatsoever, whether municipal or parliamentary, including school 
  and local improvement rates, charged, assessed or levied in respect of and referable 
  solely to Tenant's building plus Tenant's proportionate share of such taxes, 
  of the land under the Shopping Centre buildings, plus Tenant's proportionate 
  share of such taxes, rates and assessments charged, assessed or levied in respect 
  of the parking lot and common areas (including any enclosed mall areas which 
  are not used or occupied by kiosks, boutiques or other merchandise displays 
  subject to the terms of Article 18 hereof) of the Shopping Centre; provided 
  that Tenant's covenant to reimburse as aforesaid shall apply solely to such 
  taxes, rates and assessments payable and paid for the period commencing at the 
  date of occupancy by Tenant and shall exclude the payment of taxes, rates and 
  assessments which are incurred or levied as a result of Landlord's activity 
  in the development of the Shopping Centre or developing Tenant's building for 
  Tenant's occupancy.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">[4] In the event that either the lands and premises comprising 
  the said Shopping Centre are assessed &quot;en bloc&quot; for real property, 
  school or local improvement purposes, or Tenant's building is not assessed and 
  taxed as a separate and independent tax lot for real property, school or local 
  improvement purposes, then Tenant shall either be entitled to apply for apportionment 
  or make application to the Taxing Authority to have Tenant's building assessed 
  as a separate and independent tax lot. In the event that application for apportionment 
  fails or if the Taxing Authority refuses to assess Tenant's building as a separate 
  and independent tax lot then the taxes allocable to Tenant's building shall 
  be the amount which is the result obtained by multiplying the sum of all taxes 
  levied against such tax lot or lots of which the entire Shopping Centre forms 
  a part by a fraction having as its numerator the floor area space of Tenant's 
  building (excluding mezzanine areas), and as its denominator the total leasable 
  floor area of all buildings and premises situated within such tax lot or lots 
  of which the entire Shopping Centre forms a part (excluding all mezzanine areas, 
  and excluding an area designed for use as offices, said offices being designated 
  in Purple on said Exhibit &quot;B&quot;, provided such area designated in Purple 
  is used as office space) [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [4] The dispute between Zellers and the landlord is whether, as a result of 
  the 1997 amendments to the Assessment Act, which took effect in the 1998 taxation 
  year, paragraph 4 of Article 17 became operative. </p>
<p>
  [5] The landlord's position, which the applications judge accepted, was that 
  the amendments to the Assessment Act abolishing separate assessments for each 
  business, which results in no separate assessment for Zellers, triggered the 
  application of paragraph 4 to determine the allocation and payment of realty 
  taxes. This is an appeal by Zellers from that determination. Based on the clear 
  language of the lease, I agree with the conclusion reached by the applications 
  judge.</p>
<p>
  [6] Prior to the legislative amendments, the landlord received a list of each 
  business in the shopping mall which was separately assessed for business taxes, 
  and each tenant received a separate notice of assessment, with an amount for 
  the premises and one for its share of the parking facilities. Under this scheme, 
  the realty taxes of tenants in the shopping mall were allocated in accordance 
  with paragraph 2 of Article 17 of the lease. </p>
<p>
  [7] The amendments to the Assessment Act included the repeal of s. 7, pursuant 
  to which separate assessments for business taxes had taken place. As a result, 
  separate bills for business taxes were abolished. The post-1998 annual notice 
  of assessment which the landlord now receives does not list separately any of 
  the tenants of the property. Instead, a block figure is provided for the whole 
  shopping mall, with no separate notice of assessment for any of the tenants, 
  and the municipality levies real property taxes based on a global assessment 
  of the property. </p>
<p>
  [8] In the absence of separate assessments for each tenant as had been provided 
  to it prior to the 1997 amendments, the landlord allocated the real property 
  taxes payable by Zellers and the other tenants in accordance with paragraph 
  4 of Article 17 of the lease agreement which set out the applicable formula 
  in the event that there were no separate and independent assessments.</p>
<p>
  [9] Zellers submitted that it has in fact been separately assessed and that 
  paragraph 4 of Article 17, therefore, does not apply. It relies on a document 
  from the assessment authority's Shopping Centre Valuation and Apportionment 
  Record which was used to calculate the assessment for the entire shopping centre 
  for 1998 to 2001. There is no doubt that the information on this form mentions 
  an amount for Zellers' premises; however, this informal document is not, in 
  my view, a separate assessment as contemplated by the lease. Since Zellers has 
  not sought - or received - a separate assessment, as it is entitled under paragraph 
  4 of Article 17 to do, the formula set out in that paragraph for the calculation 
  of its share of taxes applies. </p>
<p>
  [10] It is significant that prior to the 1997 repeal of the provisions requiring 
  separate tax assessments for each tenant, the landlord received a list of each 
  of the tenants in the shopping mall with a separate assessment for each tenant. 
  Unlike the document Zellers now relies on, it was called a &quot;notice of property 
  assessment&quot;, listed each occupant of the shopping mall separately, and 
  attributed an &quot;assessed value&quot; both for each tenant's business and 
  its parking facilities. The document Zellers relies on, on the other hand, refers 
  to the &quot;current value&quot;, makes no reference to parking or common areas, 
  and is not called an assessment. </p>
<p>
  [11] I see no basis for elevating the document Zellers relies on to the status 
  of an &quot;assessment&quot; as contemplated by the lease. &quot;Assessments&quot; 
  were what the landlord had received annually and separately for each tenant's 
  premises and parking facilities. These separate assessments, which were used 
  when the lease was signed, were what the parties based the provisions of Article 
  17 on. The separate assessments are addressed in paragraph 2.</p>
<p>
  [12] But the parties clearly also contemplated the possibility that separate 
  assessments for each business might in future no longer take place, and this 
  is the eventuality that paragraph 4 of Article 17 of the lease anticipates. 
  With the repeal of legislation providing for separate tax assessments of each 
  individual tenant's premises in 1998, that eventuality materializes. </p>
<p>
  [13] I see no ambiguity in Article 17 of the lease. Paragraph 2 of Article 17 
  provides that the &quot;tenant shall reimburse Landlord for all taxes, rates 
  and assessments&#133;charged, assessed or levied in respect of an referable 
  solely to Tenant's building&#133;&quot;. Paragraph 4 provides a formula for 
  calculating the tenant's tax liability if the shopping centre is assessed &quot;en 
  bloc&quot; and &quot;Tenant's building is not assessed and taxed as a separate 
  and independent tax lot for real property&#133;purposes&#133;&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [14] There is no doubt that separate assessments no longer take place. Nor is 
  there any doubt that what has been received by the landlord annually since the 
  1997 amendments is a single global figure for the whole shopping mall. It is 
  difficult to see how this could be considered anything other than an &quot;en 
  bloc&quot; assessment, particularly considering that the pre-amendment assessments 
  separately listed each of the businesses and their assessed business value both 
  for the premises and parking.</p>
<p>
  [15] Any doubt about whether there are now separate assessments was dispelled 
  in a letter sent to the landlord on May 10, 2000 after a request by it for individual 
  assessments for each tenant in the shopping centres it owned. The letter from 
  the director of Appraisal Services of the Ontario Property Assessment Corporation 
  stated that legislative changes to the Assessment Act eliminated the requirement 
  for the assessor to produce separate assessments for each tenant, and that the 
  assessors &quot;&#133;do not apportion an assessment on a tenant by tenant basis&quot;. 
  The relevant portions of the letter are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> I am writing to you in response to your request for an individual 
  assessment or apportionment for each tenant area. Prior to 1998 the assessment 
  roll contained an assessment for each tenant in a multiple unit commercial or 
  industrial property. This assessment was commonly referred to as the tenant 
  plate. The creation of this tenant plate was for the express purpose of creating 
  a separate business assessment for the tenant.</p>
<p class="indent">With the enactment of the Fair Municipal Finance Act, 1997, 
  [S.O. 1997, c. 5] Bill 106, section 7 of the Assessment Act was repealed abolishing 
  business assessment. The elimination of the business assessment made the requirement 
  to produce a separate assessment for each business tenant redundant. Hence, 
  subsection 14 (1) of the Act was amended and several paragraphs were repealed. 
  These changes eliminated the requirement for the assessor to produce a separate 
  assessment for the tenant.</p>
<p class="indent">While I appreciate that this separate tenant assessment was 
  often used as a convenient basis for allocating realty taxes under lease agreements, 
  it was not established for that purpose. With its elimination there is no legislative 
  requirement and therefore, we do not apportion an assessment on a tenant by 
  tenant basis.</p>
<p>
  [16] It is worth noting that although paragraph 4 of Article 17 entitles the 
  tenant to make an application to the Taxing Authority to have the tenant's building 
  assessed as a separate and independent tax lot, Zellers took no steps to have 
  such a separate assessment made. Moreover, s. 17.3 of the amended Assessment 
  Act provides that the Minister may make regulations providing for the assessment, 
  as a separate property, of the portion of a property occupied by a tenant. Zellers 
  took no steps to apply to the Minister to seek a regulation providing for a 
  separate assessment of the property it occupied. In fact, Zellers took none 
  of the steps available to it to apportion taxes or receive a separate independent 
  assessment.</p>
<p>
  [17] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs fixed in the total amount 
  of $10,000.</p>
