<p>On appeal from the Order of the Divisional Court (McRae, Then and Day JJ.), 
  dated December 14, 2001, dismissing the appeal of the appellant from the Order 
  of Ferrier J. dated October 25, 2000.</p>
<P>
  ROSENBERG J.A.:</p>   <P>
  [1] This is one of two appeals heard by this court that raise issues concerning 
  the certification of class proceedings where the claim is principally based 
  upon allegations of negligent misrepresentation in the marketing of insurance 
  policies. As in the companion appeal, Kumar v. The Mutual Life Assurance Company 
  and Prudential Assurance Company Limited, the appellant claims that he was misled 
  as to the nature of so-called vanishing premium or premium offset feature of 
  his whole life policy. </p>   <P>
  [2] Ferrier J. refused to certify the action as a class proceeding under the 
  Class Proceedings Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c.6. He. relied in part on the decision 
  of Cummings J. in the Kumar case. The appeals from these orders were heard together 
  by the Divisional Court. McRae J. writing for the Divisional Court in reasons 
  reported at (2001), 17 C.P.C. (5th) 103 dismissed the appeals. For the following 
  reasons I would dismiss the appeal.</p>   <P>
  THE FACTS</p>   <P>
  [3] The appellant Dr. George Zicherman is the proposed representative plaintiff. 
  He is a dentist with a practice in Toronto. He is married and has three children. 
  In March 1988, at the age of 33, he purchased a $300,000 whole life insurance 
  policy from an agent for the respondent Equitable Life Insurance Company of 
  Canada.</p>   <P>
  [4] Before purchasing the policy, the appellant met with Equitable agent Tibor 
  Izsak. The appellant alleges that during the sales presentation, Izsak assured 
  him that after he paid premiums for 10 to 12 years, no further annual premiums 
  would be required. Thereafter, the premiums would be paid automatically through 
  the policy paid dividends. I have described the nature of this premium offset 
  or vanishing premium feature of whole life policies in the reasons in Kumar 
  that are being released with these reasons.</p>   <P>
  [5] The appellant claims that Izsak presented him with computer-generated charts 
  demonstrating how the premium offset would operate. Izsak further assured the 
  appellant that while the dividends were not guaranteed, Equitable had an impeccable 
  track record and would have no problem meeting or surpassing the projected dividends. 
  The appellant submits that this was a core misrepresentation.</p>   <P>
  [6] Relying on the evidence given by the appellant on cross-examination, the 
  respondent alleges that the appellant was fully aware that the dividend amounts 
  and the cross-over dates were not guaranteed. It says that the appellant knew 
  the document was an illustration of what might happen given certain assumptions 
  about dividends, that dividends would be based on the current scale and were 
  subject to change, that depending on these changes it may have been necessary 
  to make additional cash deposits in the future to cover premiums, and finally, 
  that premium offset was not an automatic option.</p>   <P>
  [7] By contrast, the appellant maintains that he was not explicitly made aware 
  of these risks. The appellant alleges that he would not have entered into the 
  policy of insurance had he been made aware of the fact that the illustrations 
  were not a accurate reflection of the date upon which the premiums would be 
  offset. </p>   <P>
  [8] In June 1996, Equitable told the appellant that he would have to pay premiums 
  for a total of 23 years. Later, in October 1997, as the tenth year of the policy 
  was drawing to a close, the appellant asked to see a new illustration. Upon 
  reviewing the updated chart, he learned that the premium on his policy would 
  not offset for another 10 years. In response to this, he commenced this class 
  action against Equitable.</p>   <P>
  [9] The agent that dealt with the appellant, Mr. Izsak passed away in 1996.</p>   <P>
  ANALYSIS</p>   <P>
  [10] In the companion case, Kumar, I have dealt with the submissions made by 
  the appellant concerning the reasons of the Divisional Court. I have also discussed 
  why I found that there was no common issue in Kumar and that, in any event, 
  why a class proceeding would not be the preferable procedure. There are differences 
  between this case and Kumar, and the appellant argues that irrespective of the 
  result in Kumar, this is a proper case for certification as a class proceeding. 
  I am not persuaded that those differences should lead to a different result 
  and I will explain why after setting them out. For that purpose I adopt the 
  findings of the motions judge. He found the following major differences between 
  this case and the Kumar case [referred to by the motion judge as Prudential]:</p>   
<P class="indent"> 1. In Prudential, the evidence did not support the allegation 
  that Prudential engaged in any organized and systemic marketing of premium offset 
  insurance policies. Agents seldom used premium offset illustrations. The contrary 
  is the case with Equitable. The defendant admits this to be the case in its 
  statement of defence; further, Equitable admits that illustrations were used 
  extensively and that when an illustration was requested by an agent (for a period 
  of the time at issue in this action) a &quot;script&quot; was sent out with 
  the illustration. The &quot;script&quot; is identified at p. 469 of the defendant's 
  motion record. &quot;Script&quot; is a misnomer. It was not a text followed 
  by the agent, but rather a one-page explanation sheet about the premium offset 
  feature, which was sent to agents and passed on, in some cases apparently, to 
  purchasers. Shortly put, in the case of Equitable there was an organized and 
  systemic [sic] marketing of the premium offset policies, as well, of course, 
  its other whole life policies. Based on the documentation produced by Equitable, 
  it would appear however, that the agents were universally cautioned by head 
  office that the dividend rates were not guaranteed and that lower rates might 
  result in further cash deposits to be paid.</p>
<P class="indent">2. The documentary evidence establishes that while policy holders 
  over the years were told in numerical terms about dividend rates when those 
  rates were good, the written information given to policy holders about the rates 
  was &quot;soft&quot; and not precise when rates were not good. In the latter 
  instances however, a 1-800 number was available for any policy holder who had 
  inquiries. The impact of this point would have to be determined at a trial. 
  Suffice it to say that it is a factual feature that can be argued by a claimant 
  in this case as part of the merits of the cause of action. There is no reference 
  in the Prudential decision to factors of this nature.</p>
<P class="indent">3. Contrary to the situation in Prudential, it is possible to 
  identify which Equitable policies were sold with the premium offset feature, 
  by going to the head office files. Although these files will not necessarily 
  establish which policy holders received printed illustrations, the files will 
  at least indicate which files were sold with the feature. Thus, in effect, tracking 
  down the members of the class would be a much easier proposition in the case 
  at bar and there is much greater likelihood of a high percentage of potential 
  class members receiving notice of proceedings.</p>
<P class="indent">4. In the case of Equitable, the dividend scale allegedly was 
  sensitive, resulting in volatility in the premium offset calculations for the 
  cross-over point. This factor was not mentioned by Cumming J. in his reasons 
  in Prudential. I would think it fair to assume that the senior managers and 
  officers of an insurance company would be as aware as Equitable was of the volatility 
  of the scale and therefore the cross-over dates. There is nothing in Cumming 
  J.'s decision that would indicate that the volatility in the case at bar is 
  any greater than it was in the case of Prudential.</p>
<P class="indent">5. In the case of Prudential, an extensive ADR program was established 
  to deal with the claims. The particulars are referred to in the reasons of Cumming 
  J. In the case at bar however, the evidence is that Equitable has received very 
  few complaints, described by Mr. Courtepatte as &quot;negligible&quot;. An examination 
  of the 500 files sampled in conjunction with this motion, would appear to support 
  that as a fair adjective. In these circumstances, it is argued by Equitable, 
  and I agree, that there is simply no evidence to justify the establishment of 
  an extensive ADR program.</p>
<P>
  [11] In his reasons, the motion judge found that none of the factual distinctions 
  justified a different result from that reached by Cumming J. in Kumar. He held 
  that the claim did not raise a common issue and that, in any event, the proposed 
  class proceeding is not the preferable procedure for the resolution of the common 
  issues. </p>   <P>
  [12] The differences between this case and Kumar do not reach the central problem 
  that makes both these proceedings unsuitable for certification. The reasons 
  of the motion judge in this case suggest that there was a systematic marketing 
  of premium offset policies, a matter more hotly disputed by the Kumar defendants. 
  In both cases, however, the policy holders dealt with individual agents and 
  the class members would still have to show that the agents with whom they dealt 
  made misleading representations about the premium offset feature, and that the 
  prospective policyholder reasonably relied upon the representation. The action 
  would ultimately break down into individual proceedings: Rumley v. British Columbia, 
  [2001] 3 S.C.R. 184 at para. 29. As I said in Kumar, establishing that the respondent 
  was negligent in any of the ways suggested by the appellant would not represent 
  a substantial ingredient in each of the class members' claims.</p>   <P>
  [13] Further, my reasons in Kumar concerning preferable procedure apply equally 
  to this case. The factual distinctions noted by the motion judge do not affect 
  that finding, which turned on the importance of the individual issues in relation 
  to the proposed common issue. The appellant's affidavit submitted on the application 
  for certification demonstrates the difficulties in allowing this matter to go 
  forward as a class proceeding. The core of the appellant's complaints concern 
  the verbal and written representations made by the agent that, in effect, told 
  the appellant to ignore the warnings set out in the illustrations provided by 
  the respondent. For example, the appellant states as follows:</p>   
<P class="indent"> In response [to the warning], Izsak indicated that I was not 
  to worry about the language on the back of the illustration since, even in a 
  worst case scenario, I would only be required to pay for 12 years of premiums. 
  Izsak emphasized that my maximum payment period of premiums would be from 10 
  to 12 years.</p>   
<P>
  [14] In my view, it has not been shown that the motion judge or the Divisional 
  Court erred in concluding that the appellant had not satisfied the common issues 
  and preferable procedure requirements in s. 5 of the Class Proceedings Act, 
  1992, S.O. 1992, c. 6.</p>   <P>
  [15] The motion judge also held that there was no identifiable class of two 
  or more persons that would be represented by the representative plaintiff. He 
  said:</p>   
<P class="indent"> There is no evidence that anyone other than Mr. Zicherman has 
  raised a cause of action. There is no evidence of anyone other than Mr. Zicherman 
  being willing to engage the courts or assert a cause of action.</p>
<P class="indent">It may be that other class members do exist but that has not 
  been established on this motion. I note that partners, associates, and a family 
  member of Mr. Zicherman purchased similar policies and none of them have been 
  identified in the evidence as asserting a claim or even having a complaint.</p>
<P class="indent">I recognize that it is not fatal to be unable to identify every 
  member of the class such a requirement would be unrealistic. On the other hand,</p>
<P class="indent15">A class proceeding cannot be created by simply shrouding an 
  individual action with a proposed class. That is to say, it is not sufficient 
  to make a bald assertion that a class exists. The record before the court must 
  contain a sufficient evidentiary basis to establish the existence of the class.</p>
<P class="indent">Lau v. Bayview Landmark Inc., [1999] O.J. No. 4060 at para. 
  23.</p>
<P>
  [16] I have addressed a similar issue in the Kumar reasons for judgment. The 
  proposed class definition in this case is essentially the same as that in Kumar 
  and therefore shares the same difficulties I have noted in the Kumar reasons. 
  Nevertheless, as in that case, I will assume that there is an identifiable class. 
  The respondent concedes that it has had 87 complaints with respect to the premium 
  offset feature. In view of my conclusions on common issues and preferable procedure, 
  however, I would dismiss this appeal.</p>   <P>
  DISPOSITION</p>   <P>
  [17] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. The respondent shall have ten 
  days from release of these reasons to provide the Senior Legal Officer with 
  submissions on costs and its bill of costs. The appellant may file his submissions 
  as to costs within seven days after receipt of the respondent's submissions. 
  The respondent may respond within 7 days thereafter.</p>

  &quot;I agree R. Roy McMurtry C.J.O.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I agree M.A. Catzman J.A.&quot;</p>
