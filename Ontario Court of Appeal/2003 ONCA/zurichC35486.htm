<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Roydon Kealey of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, sitting without a jury, dated November 15, 2000.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants appeal the decision of the motions judge to the effect that, 
  as of December 10, 1993, Henry Paul Fortin no longer had insurance with Zurich 
  Canada against liability arising from the ownership, use, or operation of a 
  1970 GMC truck.</p>
<p>
  [2] On August 18, 1993, Fortin, through his insurance broker Ernest Jacobs, 
  insured two vehicles, a Ford Torino and a 1970 GMC truck with Zurich. As a result 
  of using the GMC truck in a manner that may have resulted in the cancellation 
  of the policy, Fortin, on the advice of Jacobs, made an informed decision to 
  delete the GMC truck from his insurance policy. On December 9, 1993, in Jacobs' 
  office, Fortin and Jacobs signed an Acknowledgement of Policy Change Form which 
  provided that insurance coverage on the GMC truck would be deleted, effective 
  at 12:01 a.m. on December 10, 1993.</p>
<p>
  [3] Jacobs emphasized to Fortin that after December 10, 1993, Fortin would no 
  longer have insurance on his GMC truck. He also told Fortin that, after Zurich 
  had processed the paperwork, he would be entitled to a premium adjustment, calculated 
  as of the effective date shown on the Acknowledgement of Policy Change Form.</p>
<p>
  [4] On December 9, 1993, Jacobs informed Zurich by fax that Fortin had deleted 
  the GMC truck from his policy. The notice of deletion of the GMC truck was date-stamped 
  in Zurich's offices on December 15, 1993. </p>
<p>
  [5] On January 13, 1994, Zurich credited Fortin with an overpayment of premium 
  on his policy effective December 10, 1993, in relation to the deletion from 
  coverage of the GMC truck. On February 16, 1994, Zurich forwarded an Amended 
  Insurance Certificate to Fortin, showing the deletion of the GMC truck.</p>
<p>
  [6] In the meantime, on December 27, 1993, Fortin was involved in an accident 
  with the GMC truck resulting in injuries to the appellant, Susan Stewart, which 
  accident gave rise to this action. </p>
<p>
  [7] The appellants do not dispute that Fortin and Jacobs intended to delete 
  coverage on the GMC truck, effective December 10, 1993. Nor do they dispute 
  that Fortin and Jacobs both believed that coverage had been deleted. The argument 
  advanced by the appellants, who are claimants and not insured under the policy, 
  is that the cancellation only became effective when it was processed administratively 
  by Zurich and Fortin's unearned premium was credited to him in January 1994. 
  They take this position on the basis that Jacobs did not have the authority 
  to accept Fortin's request and that further, when Zurich purported to accept 
  it, it was too late because a loss had already occurred.</p>
<p>
  [8] On the basis of the evidence of John Rafuse, regional manager of Zurich, 
  the motions judge found that Jacobs was authorized as Zurich's agent to accept 
  an Acknowledgement of Policy Change Form on Zurich's behalf and to commit Zurich 
  to such a change where an insured wished to delete a vehicle from coverage. 
  He also found that no further action was required by Zurich in order to give 
  effect to Fortin's cancellation of insurance on the GMC truck. Zurich would 
  have no choice but to implement the concluded agreement. </p>
<p>
  [9] The motions judge noted that Jacobs was also of the view that he was able 
  to accept instructions to delete coverage on behalf of Zurich. </p>
<p>
  [10] Rafuse was not cross-examined on his affidavit. Although Fortin was a party 
  to the action, there was no evidence led by him and the appellants chose not 
  to examine him for discovery. Fortin does not dispute Zurich's position on this 
  appeal.</p>
<p>
  [11] There was no contrary evidence and it is on the basis of these facts that 
  the motions judge concluded that the evidence on this point was &quot;unchallenged&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [12] The findings of the motions judge are amply supported by the evidence and 
  there is no basis to interfere. After the cancellation had been effectively 
  accepted by Jacobs on Zurich's behalf, the remaining process was merely administrative. 
  The fact that the premium had not yet been returned did not affect the validity 
  of the cancellation. </p>
<p>
  [13] The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $7,850.00 plus G.S.T.</p>
