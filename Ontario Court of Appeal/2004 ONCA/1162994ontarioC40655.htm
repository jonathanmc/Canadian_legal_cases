<p>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court dated May 8, 2003.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>
  [1] The respondent ("landlord") applied to the Ontario Rental Housing 
  Tribunal ("Tribunal") for an order under s. 86 of the Tenant Protection 
  Act, S.O. 1997, c. 24, as amended (the "Act"), requiring the appellant 
  Bakker and three other individuals to pay rent arrears owed to the landlord. 
  </p>
<p>
  [2] The Tribunal can make an order under s. 86 requiring payment of rent arrears 
  only against a person who is "a tenant in possession of the rental unit" 
  at the time of the application. It was common ground before the Tribunal that 
  Mr. Bakker, and two of the other tenants, David Crane and Constantine Klemos, 
  had permanently vacated the apartment long before the s. 86 application was 
  brought by the landlord. The Tribunal held that these three individuals were 
  not "tenants in possession" and consequently no order could be made 
  against them under s. 86. The fourth lessee, John Holmes, was in possession 
  of the rental unit when the application was commenced and the Tribunal made 
  an order against him requiring payment of the rent arrears.</p>
<p>
  [3] The landlord appealed the dismissal of the application as against Bakker, 
  Crane and Klemos to the Divisional Court. In a brief endorsement, the Divisional 
  Court reversed the Tribunal on the basis that possession by any of the four 
  lessees constituted possession by all four of them. The court said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The occupation and possession by the one co-tenant, therefore, constituted the 
  occupation and possession on the part of all four tenants for the purposes of 
  the Tenant Protection Act. The Tribunal, therefore, erred in failing to find 
  all four tenants in occupation and possession. It follows, therefore, that the 
  relief granted against the single tenant Holmes should be granted as against 
  all four tenants. &#133; </p>
<p>
  [4] The order of the Divisional Court tracks the endorsement. Paragraph one 
  reads: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; The occupation and possession of the rental unit by one of the co-tenants 
  is the occupancy and possession on the part of the four tenants for the purposes 
  of the Tenant Protection Act.</p>
<p>
  [5] Bakker was granted leave to appeal to this court. Crane and Klemos did not 
  seek leave to appeal. Given the potentially significant ramifications of the 
  broad order made by the Divisional Court, the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario 
  ("ACTO") was granted leave to intervene in the appeal. ACTO has raised 
  several issues concerning the interpretation of the Act in circumstances involving 
  co-tenants whose interests diverge during a tenancy. ACTO contends that several 
  provisions of the Act do not appear to have contemplated co-tenancies. It asks 
  this court to interpret those provisions so as to avoid situations in which 
  the unilateral actions of one co-tenant can adversely affect the rights of the 
  other. </p>
<p>
  [6] I would allow the appeal and restore the order of the Tribunal. I think 
  the Tribunal correctly held that Bakker was not "a tenant in possession 
  of the rental unit", as required by s. 86 of the Act, when the application 
  was brought by the landlord. The Tribunal had no power to make an order against 
  Bakker. Bakker's liability for rent arrears, if any, can only be determined 
  by the courts. On the approach I take, I do not reach the broader questions 
  raised by ACTO. </p>
<p>The Facts</p>
<p>
  [7] Bakker, Crane, Klemos and Holmes attended the University of Western Ontario 
  in London. They rented an apartment from the landlord in the spring of 1999. 
  All four signed a lease in which they were identified as the "lessee". 
  The lease ran from May 1, 1999 to April 30, 2000 and provided that if the lessee 
  remained in occupation after the expiration of the one year term, the lessee 
  was deemed to be a monthly tenant on the terms and conditions set out in the 
  lease. Mr. Bakker moved out of the apartment shortly before the expiration of 
  the lease in April 2000, to pursue a professional football career in Edmonton, 
  Alberta. It was contended on behalf of Mr. Bakker and the other tenants that 
  Mr. Robinson, the president of the landlord, had agreed when the lease was signed, 
  that oral notification of termination would be sufficient. It was alleged that 
  Mr. Bakker had provided oral notice well before he left. Mr. Robinson denied 
  that there was any agreement to accept oral notice or that any kind of notice 
  had been given to him or the landlord by Mr. Bakker. The Tribunal did not address 
  these factual disputes in its reasons.</p>
<p>
  [8] Mr. Crane and Mr. Klemos also moved out of the apartment before the landlord 
  brought this application. Mr. Holmes was living in the apartment at the time 
  the application was made. In the application, the landlord claimed arrears of 
  some $8,300.00, almost all of which related to rent owing during the year 2002. 
  As indicated above, Bakker had not lived in the apartment since before April 
  2000. </p>
<p>The Tribunal's Ruling</p>
<p>
  [9] The reasons of the Tribunal are brief and conclusory. After setting out 
  s. 86(1) of the Act, the Tribunal held that Bakker, Crane and Klemos had "vacated 
  the rental unit prior to the application" and were not "occupying 
  the rental unit at the time of the application". Neither fact was in dispute. 
  Based on these findings, the Tribunal held that Bakker, Crane and Klemos were 
  not "tenants in possession" when the application was brought. Consequently, 
  the Tribunal had no power to make an order against them.</p>
<p>
  The Reasons of the Divisional Court</p>
<p>
  [10] The reasons of the Divisional Court are also brief and conclusory. The 
  court made no reference to s. 86(1) of the Act and appears to have proceeded 
  on the basis that as all four individuals were named in the lease, they were 
  jointly liable under the lease. As liability was joint, possession by one was 
  deemed to be possession by all. The approach taken by the Divisional Court would 
  seem to have necessitated a determination of the factual dispute over the alleged 
  agreement between the landlord and Bakker to allow Bakker to orally terminate 
  his obligations under the lease. The Divisional Court, however, made no reference 
  to this factual dispute, but instead granted judgment against Bakker (as well 
  as Crane and Klemos) in the amount of the outstanding rent arrears.</p>
<p>
  The Standard of Review</p>
<p>
  [11] Under s. 196 of the Act, appeals from the Tribunal to the Divisional Court 
  are limited to questions of law. It would appear that the Divisional Court assumed 
  that the Tribunal's decision was reviewable on a correctness standard. None 
  of the parties to this appeal challenged that assumption. As I am satisfied 
  that the Tribunal's decision was correct, I too will assume, for the purposes 
  of this appeal, that correctness is the appropriate standard of review. I would 
  leave the ultimate determination as to the appropriate standard of review to 
  a case where the issue is squarely raised and requires resolution: See Cartaway 
  Resources Corp. (Re) 2004 SCC 66 at para. 43, 44.</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>
  [12] The relevant provisions of the Act are set out below: </p>
<p class="indent"> Section 1</p>
<p class="indent">1. In this Act,</p>
<p class="indent">"tenant" includes a person who is lessee, occupant, sub-tenant, 
  under-tenant, and the person's assigns and legal representatives;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">86(1) A landlord may apply to the Tribunal for an order for 
  the payment of arrears of rent if,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the tenant has not paid rent lawfully required under the 
  tenancy agreement; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the tenant is in possession of the rental unit.</p>
<p class="indent">Compensation, overholding tenant</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If a tenant is in possession of a rental unit after the 
  tenancy has been terminated, the landlord may apply to the Tribunal for an order 
  for the payment of compensation for the use and occupation of a rental unit 
  after a notice of termination or an agreement to terminate the tenancy has taken 
  effect [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [13] Section 86(1)(b) limits those against whom the Tribunal can make an order 
  for the payment of rent arrears. Even if the individual had not paid rent owed 
  under a tenancy agreement (s. 86(1)(a)), the Tribunal cannot make an order against 
  that individual unless he or she is "a tenant in possession of the rental 
  unit". The question of whether a tenant is "in possession of the rental 
  unit" is distinct from the question of whether that tenant is legally liable 
  for the rent arrears. I think the Divisional Court erred in law by defining 
  possession in s. 86(1)(b) by reference to its view of the nature of the liability 
  imposed by the lease. </p>
<p>
  [14] The phrase "tenant in possession" is not defined in the Act and 
  is not a term of art with a settled legal meaning. Counsel were unable to find 
  any cases where the phrase as used in s. 86 of the Act has been interpreted 
  by the Tribunal or the courts. The phrase as it appeared in s. 113(2) of the 
  predecessor legislation, the Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 232, was 
  considered in ERS Employee Relocation Services v. Ryan (Roy) Milnes and Brenda 
  Coleman (1988), 4 T.L.L.R. 129 (Ont. Dist. Ct.). Section 113(1) of the former 
  Landlord and Tenant Act provided that a landlord could make a summary application 
  to the County Court for an order requiring payment of arrears. Section 113(2) 
  indicated that the application could only be made where "the tenant is 
  in possession". Judge Hoilett held that tenants who had permanently vacated 
  the rental unit when the application was commenced could not be regarded as 
  tenants "in possession" of the unit, even though they had not given 
  notice of their intent to vacate and had kept the keys to the unit. After referring 
  to possession as a fluid concept taking its meaning from its context, His Honour 
  said at p. 137: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In arriving at that conclusion I am mindful of the summary proceedings contemplated 
  by the Act which is aimed at the expeditious resolution of disputes where the 
  immediacy of an actual occupancy demands it. Where, as in the instant case, 
  that actual occupation has ceased to exist then, the urgency contemplated by 
  the summary proceedings no longer obtains.</p>
<p>
  [15] The approach to the phrase "tenant in possession" taken in ERS 
  Employee Relocation Services v. Ryan (Roy) Milnes and Brenda Coleman offers 
  some guidance for the interpretation of the present provisions. </p>
<p>
  [16] A "tenant in possession" must be a tenant as defined in s. 1 
  of the Act. The status of tenant is, however, not enough under s. 86 of the 
  Act. While some sections permit the Tribunal to make orders against tenants 
  without any qualification (e.g. s. 77), s. 86 adds the qualifying words "in 
  possession of the rental unit". The phrase "tenant in possession" 
  must refer to a subset of the broader group identified as tenants under the 
  Act. Not all tenants will be "tenants in possession". Some persons 
  who qualify as tenants under the Act will not be in possession of the rental 
  unit and will, therefore, not be subject to an order under s. 86.</p>
<p>
  [17] In assigning meaning to the phrase "tenant in possession of the rental 
  unit", it is helpful to begin with the purpose of the Act. This court has 
  described the purpose as being "to encourage speedy, fair and efficient 
  access to justice in residential tenancy matters": Metropolitan Toronto 
  Housing Authority v. Godwin (2002), 161 O.A.C. 57 at 62 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [18] Not every dispute over rent arrears can be resolved by the Tribunal in 
  a speedy, fair and efficient manner. I think the requirement that the tenant 
  be "in possession of the rental unit" at the time of the application 
  reflects a determination that rent arrears disputes can be resolved efficiently 
  and fairly through the Tribunal where the tenant at the time of the application 
  continues to have some connection with the rental unit and, therefore, some 
  relationship with the landlord. Situations where that connection has been severed 
  and the relationship gone are best resolved through the more formal court processes. 
  </p>
<p>
  [19] Some further assistance in defining "tenant in possession" is 
  found by an examination of s. 86(2). That subsection provides that a landlord 
  may be compensated for "the use and occupation" of a rental unit after 
  notice of termination of the lease. A landlord can only be compensated, however, 
  if the tenant is "in possession of the rental unit" when the landlord's 
  application is made. This suggests that a "tenant in possession" is 
  a person who was using or occupying the rental unit at the time of the application 
  but does not necessarily indicate that the phrase is limited to users and occupiers. 
  </p>
<p>
  [20] Possession is a difficult concept to define. Both in common and legal parlance, 
  it connotes some form of control over the thing said to be possessed: e.g. D. 
  Dukelow, B. Nuse, The Dictionary of Canadian Law 2nd ed., (1995) Carswell at 
  p. 916; The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. II (1973) p. 1635. Clearly, 
  possession in s. 86(1)(b) is not limited to immediate physical control. For 
  example, a tenant who locks up a rental unit and leaves on an extended vacation, 
  continues to exercise sufficient control over that rental unit so as to qualify 
  as a "tenant in possession" for the purposes of s. 86(1)(b). In my 
  view, possession of a rental unit refers to some form of control over that unit 
  as demonstrated by factors such as access to, use of, or occupation of the unit. 
  </p>
<p>
  [21] There will be cases, although I would not think a great many, where a determination 
  of whether the tenant was "in possession of the rental unit" at the 
  time of the application will raise a difficult issue. In those cases, the Tribunal 
  will have to decide, based on the evidence, whether there is a sufficient connection 
  between the rental unit and the tenant to permit a finding that the tenant was 
  "in possession" of that rental unit. </p>
<p>
  [22] In this case, there was no connection between Bakker and the rental unit 
  at the time the s. 86 application was commenced. Bakker exercised no control 
  over that unit. He had unequivocally, completely, and permanently vacated the 
  unit more than two years before the application. </p>
<p>
  [23] I stress that my conclusion that Bakker was not "a tenant in possession" 
  does not determine whether Bakker was liable for the rent arrears under the 
  lease. He may or may not be liable depending on the interpretation of the lease 
  and the relevant provisions in the Act. If the landlord wants to chase Bakker 
  for the rent arrears, it will have to go through the courts. I make no comment 
  on the merits of that course of action.</p>
<p>
  [24] As indicated above, my conclusion that the Tribunal correctly determined 
  that it had no authority to make an order against Bakker under s. 86 of the 
  Act makes it unnecessary to consider the broader issues raised on the appeal. 
  The court was urged by ACTO to address those issues in any event. Despite the 
  able submissions by counsel for ACTO, I do not think it would be appropriate 
  to do so. The issues raised by the intervenor are complex and call for the interpretation 
  of many provisions of the Act. Those issues go well beyond the interests and, 
  consequently, the submissions of the parties to this appeal. More importantly, 
  this court also does not have the benefit of the analysis of these issues by 
  either the Tribunal or the Divisional Court. Any attempt to address the issues 
  raised by the intervenor on this appeal could cause more problems than it would 
  solve. </p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [25] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Divisional Court and 
  restore the order of the Tribunal.</p>
<p>
  [26] The appellant is entitled to his costs in the Divisional Court. Those costs 
  are fixed at $3,000.00. He is also entitled to his costs in this court for both 
  on the leave application and on the appeal. I would fix those costs at $8,000.00. 
  No costs for or against ACTO.</p>
