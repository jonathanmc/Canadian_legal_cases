<p>On appeal from a judgment of Justice Paul U. Rivard of the 
  Superior Court of Justice dated June 5, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ADDENDUM</p>
<p> BY THE COURT:</p>
<p> [1] This court rendered its decision in this matter on September 24, 2003. 
  Subsequent to its release, the parties disagreed on the settlement of the formal 
  order of the court and, consequently, moved for directions. </p>
<p> [2] Both parties agree that the formal order should declare that the lease, 
  which is the subject-matter of the litigation, is terminated. They disagree, 
  however, on whether the order should specify the date of termination.</p>
<p> [3] We are of the view that the date of termination could, and probably should, 
  have formed part of the court&#8217;s reasons and that the omission can now 
  be rectified by motion under rule 59.06. We are further of the view, given the 
  intervening retirement of Justice Morden that the matter can be determined under 
  s. 123 (3) of the Courts of Justice Act by the remaining justices who heard 
  the appeal. </p>
<p> [4] We hold that the lease was effectively terminated on November 19, 2001. 
  We agree with the landlord&#8217;s submission that this determination does not 
  in any way inhibit the discretion of the judge hearing the trial of the issue 
  on the question of relief from forfeiture.</p>
<p> [5] We make no order as to costs on this motion. </p>
<p> Released: MAY 13 2004 Signed: &#8220;Karen M. Weiler J.A.&#8221;<br>
  KMW &#8220;Louise Charron J.A.&#8221;</p>
