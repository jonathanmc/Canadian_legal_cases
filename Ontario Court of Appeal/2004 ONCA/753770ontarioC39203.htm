<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: June 17, 2004</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal from the judgment of Crane J. dated March 21, 2002. The 
  appeal revolves around the question of whether one party to a joint venture, 
  who acted as the manager of the affairs of the joint venture, stood in a fiduciary 
  relationship to the corporation through which the joint venture carried out 
  is operation.</p>
<p>[2] Although the trial judge did not analyze the facts in precisely those terms, 
  he did set out the legal principles underlying fiduciary relationships and he 
  did make the findings of fact necessary to support such a finding. Included 
  in the trial judge's recital of the law is a quotation from Professor Finn's 
  book on what must be found in order to determine that a fiduciary relationship 
  exists, including the need to show that one party to a relationship is entitled 
  to expect that the other will act in his or her interests and for the purpose 
  of the relationship.</p>
<p>[3] The trial judge made the following findings which, in our view, support 
  both a finding of a fiduciary relationship and a breach of the duties that flow 
  from such a finding:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the investors were operating as a joint venture;</li>
  <li>the respondent numbered company ("6 and 5") through which the 
    joint venture was carried out, held title to a real estate development comprised 
    of approximately 44 acres of land located at the intersection of highways 
    6 and 5 in Hamilton, Ontario. The property was subject to a mortgage held 
    by the Toronto-Dominion bank;</li>
  <li>6 and 5 required management;</li>
  <li>the management function at the relevant times was performed by RPI through 
    the services of Douglas Rosart; </li>
  <li>RPI through Mr. Rosart was in a position of confidence to all of the investors 
    in the joint venture;</li>
  <li>the Bank regarded RPI as the "point man" for 6 and 5 and communicated 
    solely with Mr. Rosart with regard to the Power of Sale proceedings;</li>
  <li>RPI decided on a strategy that would result in the Bank taking the property 
    belonging to 6 and 5 under a mortgage Power of Sale and under that process 
    that RPI would purchase a 100% interest in the real estate;</li>
  <li>RPI did encourage the Power of Sale proceedings after June 18, 1996, in 
    the manner it dealt with the investors' obligations for payment;</li>
  <li>RPI acted on its intention to acquire the property to a 100% interest with 
    the result that it foreclosed the property interest of 6 and 5 and thru 6 
    and 5 the interests of the other investors;</li>
  <li>Once the Power of Sale proceedings began, RPI and Mr. Rosart were in a direct 
    conflict of interest with 6 and 5. RPI, as purchaser of the property, would 
    seek the lowest possible purchase price whereas 6 and 5 as the owner of the 
    property subject to a mortgage, would require the highest possible sale price;</li>
  <li>RPI, through Douglas Rosart, breached its obligation to not act in conflict 
    with the interests of 6 and 5; and</li>
  <li>RPI ought to have resigned its management function and declared its conflict 
    of interest at a time when there were still options open to the other investors. 
    This time would likely be before June 18, 1996 but not later than July of 
    1996.</li>
</ul>
<p>[4] It will be apparent that we do not accept the characterization of the functions 
  performed by RPI and Mr. Rosart as purely administrative, as was argued by Mr. 
  Frapporti. The trial judge's findings of fact on this matter are entitled to 
  deference and we see no basis upon which to interfere with those findings.</p>
<p>[5] We are of the view that a fiduciary relationship existed between the appellants 
  and 6 and 5 at the relevant times and that the appellants breached their duty 
  of good faith. In particular, they breached their obligation to avoid placing 
  themselves in a position where their self-interest conflicted with their obligation 
  to act in the best interests of 6 and 5. It was as a result of that breach that 
  the appellants acquired the property; the imposition of a constructive trust 
  on the property in the circumstances is an appropriate remedy.</p>
<p>[6] As a consequence of this conclusion, there is no need to address the other 
  issues raised on appeal such as whether there was a breach of a duty to communicate 
  and whether the appellants acted improperly in refusing to pay interest arrears.</p>
<p>[7] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent fixed 
  in the amount of $17,000.00, inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
