<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] With respect to the learned motions judge, whether he was acting as a commissioner 
  or a court is, in our view, of no moment. If he was acting as a court, then 
  s. 136 of the Mining Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.14 applied. If he was acting as 
  a commissioner, then as the respondent fairly concedes, he was obliged under 
  s. 121 of the Act to decide the matter on the real merits and substance of the 
  case. </p>
<p>[2] In fairness to the motions judge, the parties acknowledge that s. 121 of 
  the Act was not drawn to his attention. </p>
<p>[3] In his reasons, the motions judge made it clear that but for his conclusion 
  that s. 136 did not apply, he would have dismissed the application to vacate 
  the certificates. We see no basis for interfering with that aspect of his decision.</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, we would allow the appeal and set aside the order vacating 
  the certificates. Further, we would confirm the certificates and deem them to 
  have been issued, filed and continued as of September 28, 1992.</p>
<p> [5] In the circumstances, we are of the view that the parties should bear 
  their own costs of the motion and the appeal.</p>
<p>Signed: "R. Roy McMurtry CJO"<br>
