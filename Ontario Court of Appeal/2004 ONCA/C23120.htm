<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice J. David McCombs of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on July 6, 1995, and on appeal from the 
  sentence imposed on September 15, 1995.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p> [1] The appellant<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a>, Stephen Trochym, was 
  tried by Justice J. David McCombs, sitting with a jury, on a single count of 
  second degree murder. The indictment alleged that on October 14, 1992 the appellant 
  murdered Donna Hunter. On July 6, 1995, after a trial lasting 14 weeks, the 
  jury returned a verdict of guilty. The appellant was sentenced to the mandatory 
  term of life imprisonment. Pursuant to s. 745(c) of the Criminal Code, the trial 
  judge set the period of parole ineligibility at 10 years.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant appeals the conviction on several grounds relating to the 
  admissibility of evidence, the conduct of Crown counsel, and the trial judge's 
  charge to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [3] The Crown appeals the sentence and seeks an increase in the period of parole 
  ineligibility to 12-15 years.</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant and Donna Hunter met on New Year's Eve, 1991. They began a 
  relationship. In April 1992, they started living together at Ms. Hunter's apartment 
  at 100 High Park Avenue in the west end of Toronto.</p>
<p>
  [5] Donna Hunter was last seen alive late Tuesday evening or early Wednesday 
  morning on October 13-14, 1992. No one heard from her in the next three days. 
  As a result, on Friday, October 16, her friend Barbara Corbett asked the superintendent 
  of the apartment building to let her into Ms. Hunter's apartment. The superintendent 
  suggested that she call the police. She did so and when the police arrived at 
  11:00 p.m. and entered the apartment, they found Ms. Hunter dead, in a sitting 
  position on her living room floor with her back against the couch. Her throat 
  had been cut, her jugular severed and she had numerous other knife wounds. It 
  was obvious that she had been dead for some time. The appellant was arrested 
  and charged with her murder on January 18, 1993.</p>
<p>
  [6] The Crown theory was that Ms. Hunter's murder was the culmination of her 
  troubled relationship with the appellant. Several of Ms. Hunter's friends, including 
  Barbara Corbett, Verner Kure and Jonathon Nicol, testified that the appellant 
  was a jealous and obsessive partner who could not countenance Ms. Hunter leaving 
  him. Verner Kure testified that on the night of her death, Ms. Hunter had planned 
  to tell the appellant that their relationship was over and he should move out 
  of her apartment. The Crown contends that the appellant murdered her in the 
  apartment in a rage in response to her decision.</p>
<p>
  [7] Gity Haghnegahdar, who lived across the hall from Ms. Hunter, heard a man 
  banging on Ms. Hunter's door and demanding to be let in between 1:00 and 2:00 
  a.m. on Wednesday, October 14. Ms. Haghnegahdar heard the door open to admit 
  the man. The Crown alleged that the appellant was the man who entered the apartment. 
  In support of its position, the Crown was permitted to introduce evidence that, 
  two years earlier, following his break-up with Darlene Oliphant, a previous 
  girlfriend, the appellant had returned to her apartment and banged on the door 
  demanding to be allowed entry.</p>
<p>
  [8] The Crown further alleged that the appellant left his workplace at Canada 
  Post unseen around 1:30 p.m. the following afternoon and returned to the deceased's 
  apartment to pick up some of his belongings. While there, he decided to 'stage 
  the scene' by moving the deceased's body and pulling back her nightgown to make 
  it seem as if there had been a sexual motive for the attack. Gordon Raymer, 
  the building superintendent, Phyllis Humenick, a babysitter at the superintendent's 
  apartment, and Ms. Haghnegahdar all testified that they saw the appellant in 
  the building between 1:55 and 3:00 p.m. Indeed, Ms. Haghnegahdar said that she 
  saw the appellant come out of Ms. Hunter's apartment at 3:00 p.m. Her evidence 
  was attributable in part to memory that had been enhanced during a hypnosis 
  session arranged by the police. The testimony of the witnesses about the appellant's 
  presence in the building at the time was particularly important because the 
  medical evidence at the trial was that the deceased had been killed in the early 
  hours of October 14 and that her body had been repositioned at least eight to 
  twelve hours after the murder.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant testified and the defence called several witnesses to support 
  his testimony. The defence position was that Ms. Hunter's friends did not accurately 
  describe the appellant's relationship with her. Unlike Ms. Hunter and her friends, 
  the appellant had steady employment, as a supervisor at Canada Post. His relationship 
  with Ms. Hunter foundered on her psychiatric and drinking problems. After a 
  short argument in her apartment on the night of her death, he decided to leave 
  her and move in with his parents. According to the appellant, when he left the 
  apartment at 12:30 a.m. on October 14, Ms. Hunter was alive.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant continued to go to work routinely for the rest of the week. 
  He further testified that he returned to Ms. Hunter's apartment building after 
  work - not between 1:55 and 3:00 p.m. - on October 14 to retrieve his car from 
  the underground garage. He did not go up to Ms. Hunter's apartment. In support 
  of his position that he was not at the apartment earlier in the afternoon, the 
  defence tendered evidence that the appellant's computer at Canada Post was in 
  use between 1:20 and 3:11 p.m. on October 14. Moreover, the defence introduced 
  a Canadian Tire receipt (4:58 p.m.) and a parking receipt (5:35 p.m.) to support 
  the appellant's testimony that he had gone to the apartment building after work.</p>
<p> [11] At the conclusion of the 14 week trial, the jury returned a verdict of 
  guilty of second degree murder. The trial judge imposed a sentence of life imprisonment 
  and set the period of parole ineligibility at 10 years. The appellant appeals 
  his conviction. The Crown appeals the parole ineligibility component of the 
  sentence<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a>.</p>
<p>
  [12] There are other facts relevant to the disposition of the appeals. I find 
  it convenient to introduce those facts in the context of the legal issues to 
  which they specifically relate.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [13] I would frame the issues as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Conviction appeal</p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Did the trial judge err in his treatment of the evidence 
  relating to the appellant's post-offence conduct?</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) Did the trial judge err in his treatment of the Crown's 
  assertion that the appellant had concocted a false alibi?</p>
<p class="indent"> (3) Did the trial judge err in his treatment of the alleged 
  similar fact evidence relating to the appellant's conduct respecting a previous 
  girlfriend?</p>
<p class="indent"> (4) Did the trial judge err in his treatment of the post-hypnotic 
  statements of a Crown witness?</p>
<p class="indent"> (5) Did the Crown's cross-examination of the appellant render 
  the trial unfair?</p>
<p class="indent"> (6) Did the trial judge's charge create a reasonable likelihood 
  that the jury misapprehended the correct burden of proof in a criminal trial?</p>
<p class="indent"> (7) If any of the errors in (1) to (6) is established, should 
  the appellant's conviction be affirmed by the application of the curative proviso 
  in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code?</p>
<p>
  Sentence Appeal</p>
<p>
  (8) Did the trial judge err by imposing the statutory minimum of 10 years parole 
  ineligibility, and, if so, what is an appropriate period of ineligibility?</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  Conviction appeal</p>
<p>
  (1) The appellant's post-offence conduct</p>
<p>
  [14] Throughout the trial, the Crown developed the position that the appellant's 
  conduct in the days following the deceased's murder was an important indicator 
  of his guilt. Since the trial took place in 1995, this issue was framed in the 
  language of 'consciousness of guilt', by counsel in their submissions and closing 
  addresses and by the trial judge in his jury charge. In R. v. Peavoy (1997), 
  117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 at 237 (Ont. C.A.), Weiler J.A. suggested that "the 
  use of more neutral terminology is desirable" and proposed the term "after-the-fact 
  conduct" which "avoids labelling the evidence with a conclusion which 
  the jury might not wish to draw and is therefore more accurate." The Supreme 
  Court of Canada accepted Weiler J.A.'s suggestion in R. v. White (1998), 125 
  C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 398 and proposed usage of either "after-the-fact conduct" 
  or "post-offence conduct". In White, Major J. used the latter term. 
  Since I will be making several references to White, I will use the same term.</p>
<p>
  [15] The appellant contends that the Crown misused evidence of his post-offence 
  conduct in four domains: (1) the appellant's reaction to his former girlfriend's 
  death; (2) his interaction with a police officer at the deceased's apartment 
  on Saturday, October 17; (3) his interview with police on Sunday, October 18; 
  and (4) his purported avoidance of further contact with the police after the 
  initial interview.</p>
<p>
  [16] The starting point for analysis on this issue is recognition that post-offence 
  conduct evidence is similar to most other categories of evidence. As expressed 
  by Major J. in White, at p. 398: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Evidence of post-offence conduct is not fundamentally different from other kinds 
  of circumstantial evidence. In some cases it may be highly incriminating, while 
  in others it might play only a minor corroborative role.</p>
<p>
  See also Peavoy at p. 237 and R. v. B. (S.C.) (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 530 at 
  542-43 (Ont. C.A.), Doherty and Rosenberg JJ.A.</p>
<p>
  [17] It follows that, as a general proposition, the question of whether the 
  post-offence conduct of an accused is related to the offence is one for the 
  trier of fact which, in a murder trial, is often the jury. Major J. gave clear 
  voice to this general proposition in White, at pp. 400-01: </p>
<p class="indent">
  As a general rule, it will be for the jury to decide, on the basis of the evidence 
  as a whole, whether the post-offence conduct of the accused is related to the 
  crime before them rather than to some other culpable act. It is also within 
  the province of the jury to consider how much weight, if any, such evidence 
  should be accorded in the final determination of guilt or innocence. For the 
  trial judge to interfere in that process will in most cases constitute a usurpation 
  of the jury's exclusive fact-finding role.</p>
<p>
  [18] In a similar vein, the learned authors of Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at 
  Common Law (1979, Chad. Rev.), vol. 2, in their comprehensive discussion of 
  "conduct as evidence of guilt", cautioned at p. 117: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [N]o fixed rules should be laid down. Repeated judicial warnings tell us that 
  the evidence is merely to be estimated as best we can in light of our knowledge 
  of human nature in general and of the accused in particular &#133;. [Emphasis 
  in original.]</p>
<p>
  [19] Of course, the "general rule" enunciated in White is just that: 
  a general rule, not an absolute rule. There are exceptions. One exception relates 
  to evidence that has no probative value at all: see e.g. R. v. Arcangioli (1994), 
  87 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.). A second exception arises when the prejudicial 
  effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value: see e.g. B. (S.C.), supra. 
  An example of the second exception has developed in the case law recently (and 
  after the appellant's trial) - evidence about a person's demeanour when informed 
  or accused of the murder of a victim should be admitted "with caution": 
  see R. v. Levert (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 71 at 81 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Baltrusaitis 
  (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 539 (Ont. C.A.); and R. v. Bennett (2003), 179 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 244 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [20] The appellant contends that both of these exceptions are applicable and 
  that most of the evidence relating to his post-offence conduct should have been 
  excluded because it had no probative value or because it related to the appellant's 
  demeanour in the days following his former girlfriend's death. I disagree, essentially 
  for four reasons.</p>
<p> [21] First, the admissibility of the appellant's post-offence conduct was 
  not a live issue at trial. It appears that Crown and defence counsel and the 
  trial judge accepted that most of the evidence was admissible. Importantly, 
  experienced defence counsel<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> did not object 
  to the admission of most of the evidence in this domain. Indeed, the defence 
  dealt extensively with the evidence. Much of the defence treatment of the evidence 
  seemed to be based on the strategy that it was not particularly difficult to 
  rebut the inferences the Crown tried to draw from the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [22] Second, the evidence relating to the appellant's conduct after the murder 
  of his former girlfriend, taken as a whole, is the type of evidence that should 
  be left to the jury. For example, the Crown alleged that the appellant returned 
  to the deceased's apartment approximately 12 hours after the murder to 'stage' 
  the crime scene. In addition, the appellant's explanation for not attending 
  the funeral - that the police broke a promise to inform him of its details - 
  was contradicted by the testimony of the relevant police officers. Further, 
  his explanation for going to the deceased's apartment on Saturday, October 17, 
  when her death had not been reported, was that he wanted to retrieve his belongings 
  following the break-up several days before. Yet he arrived at the apartment 
  dressed in a shirt and tie and accompanied by his frail father. The Crown contended 
  that this appearance had an entirely different motivation - to 'discover' his 
  former girlfriend's body and to be ready to 'perform' for the police. In my 
  view, these are precisely the kinds of human activity where, in Wigmore's words, 
  a jury's "knowledge of human nature" in general should be brought 
  to bear. The assessment of this kind of evidence is, as Major J. said in White, 
  a question of weight for the jury.</p>
<p>
  [23] It is true that a reading of the trial record, coupled with the vigorous 
  and eloquent submissions of appellate counsel, can promote a sense that some 
  of the post-offence conduct evidence was of limited value or even contrary to 
  the inferences sought to be drawn by the Crown. For example, to my eyes the 
  appellant's answers to the police questions in his interview on Sunday, October 
  18 were responsive and appropriate. I do not interpret his answers in a 'consciousness 
  of guilt' fashion.</p>
<p>
  [24] In contrast, the appellant's decision to not attend any of the memorial 
  events relating to the deceased and his explanation (he said that he did not 
  attend the funeral because the police broke a promise to inform him of when 
  it would take place; the police officers denied this) strike me as matters that 
  tell against the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [25] However, these reactions - by a judge, in hindsight, and on the basis of 
  a paper record - miss the point. Except in rare cases, the assessment of this 
  type of evidence is a task for the jury; it should not, as Major J. cautioned 
  in White, be usurped by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [26] Third, although some of the evidence admitted at the trial did relate to 
  the appellant's demeanour in the days following Ms. Hunter's death, and therefore 
  probably runs afoul of the subsequent jurisprudence in Levert, Baltrusaitis 
  and Bennett, I do not regard this error as fatal. The vast majority of the post-offence 
  conduct evidence at this trial related to the appellant's conduct, and not his 
  demeanour, after Ms. Hunter's death. He made many decisions, and acted on those 
  decisions, as police attention focussed on him. It was those decisions and actions, 
  not his demeanour, that formed the core of the Crown case in this domain. Moreover, 
  as I noted above, the appellant seemed content at trial to deal with all of 
  this evidence - conduct and demeanour - on the footing that he had valid explanations 
  that the jury should hear and would accept. Accordingly, as in Levert, I do 
  not think that the admission and use of the demeanour evidence in this case 
  impaired the fairness of the trial.</p>
<p>
  [27] Fourth, and of particular importance, the trial judge's treatment of the 
  post-offence conduct evidence was careful, balanced and fair. He consistently 
  set out, in an even-handed way, the positions of the Crown and the defence relating 
  to the various aspects of the appellant's post-offence conduct. For example, 
  with respect to the appellant's decision concerning the memorial events, the 
  trial judge instructed the jury: </p>
<p class="indent"> You may want to consider other factors as well. You may want 
  to consider Mr. Trochym's failure to find out when the funeral was, his failure 
  to attend the funeral or to send flowers, his promise to Barbara Corbett to 
  sell tickets to the memorial gathering organized in the memory of Donna Hunter 
  and then not doing so, and the fact that he didn't go to the memorial gathering. 
  As well, the fact that he didn't call Donna's father or send him a card, the 
  fact that he didn't take bereavement leave at work, or even tell any of his 
  co-workers about Donna Hunter's death. It is for you to determine what, if any, 
  inference you wish to draw from those facts.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, you have been given an explanation of them by Mr. 
  Trochym. Even if you do not accept it, you must consider whether the evidence 
  is proof of guilt or anxiety out of the realization he was a suspect or they 
  thought he was guilty because he is the boyfriend, and that's the reason he 
  did what he did. It is for you to determine the weight to be given to that evidence.</p>
<p>
  [28] Moreover, the trial judge's charge to the jury on post-offence conduct 
  actually inured to the benefit of the appellant in at least three important 
  respects.</p>
<p> [29] Overriding a strenuous objection from Crown counsel, the trial judge 
  included only two items in the consciousness of guilt component of his jury 
  charge - the evidence about whether the appellant had lied to the police during 
  the interview of October 18, 1992, and the evidence relating to whether the 
  appellant 'staged' the crime scene on the afternoon following the murder.<a href="#a">[4]</a><a name="4"></a> 
  The trial judge addressed all of the other aspects of the appellant's post-offence 
  conduct as circumstantial evidence; in other words, he did not highlight them 
  as requiring special attention or associate them with the label 'consciousness 
  of guilt'.</p>
<p>
  [30] In addition, the trial judge essentially removed one of the items of post-offence 
  conduct from the jury's consideration. The Crown contended that after the initial 
  interview, the appellant tried to avoid a second interview, and did so by offering 
  weak excuses, including participation in his weekly darts league and a scheduled 
  haircut. The Crown suggested that these excuses undermined the appellant's assertion 
  at the initial interview that he wanted to cooperate fully with the police investigation.</p>
<p>
  [31] At trial, the defence offered an explanation for the appellant's reluctance 
  to speak to the police after the initial interview - namely, that his brother 
  had advised him to talk to a lawyer and that he was merely putting off the police 
  until he had met with a lawyer and received legal advice. It is clear that the 
  trial judge regarded this as a strong explanation which the jury should accept. 
  Accordingly, he instructed the jury: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to be aware that every person who is being 
  investigated or questioned by the police has the right to consult with an attorney. 
  It would be completely wrong to draw any adverse inference against the accused 
  from his desire to stall for time because he wanted to consult with a lawyer. 
  I think in all the circumstances it would be best if you not consider the darts 
  and haircut comment in any way to draw an inference adverse to the accused person 
  because it may well be tied to his intention to seek the right to his lawyer, 
  a right we all have.</p>
<p>
  [32] Finally, the trial judge instructed the jury that evidence could give rise 
  to an inference of consciousness of guilt only if the jury accepted the evidence 
  on the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. For example, with respect to the 
  appellant's statements to the police in the October 18 interview, the trial 
  judge instructed: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The doctrine of reasonable doubt, as I explained to you at the beginning, applies 
  to the ultimate question, and since evidence of consciousness of guilt goes 
  to the ultimate question, you must apply the doctrine of reasonable doubt to 
  this evidence. An inference of consciousness of guilt cannot be drawn unless 
  all three points have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. What you must remember 
  is that you cannot infer consciousness of guilt solely on the basis of concluding 
  Stephen Trochym lied and you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on 
  the three things, that he made the statement, that he lied and that he did so 
  for purposes of concealing his guilt. However, as I say, if you are satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were false or misleading and deliberately 
  made to conceal his guilt, then you may use the statements as evidence of consciousness 
  of guilt.</p>
<p>
  [33] The jury charge in this trial was delivered in July 1995. This component 
  of the charge complied with the May 1995 decision of this court in R. v. Court 
  and Monaghan (1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 237. A year later, a five judge panel of 
  this court explicitly overruled Court and Monaghan in R. v. White (1996), 108 
  C.C.C. (3d) 1. The Supreme Court of Canada affirmed White with Major J. stating, 
  at p. 405: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is settled that the criminal standard of proof applies only to the jury's 
  final determination of guilt or innocence and is not to be applied to individual 
  items or categories of evidence &#133;. [T]heir verdict must be based on the 
  record as a whole, not merely on items of evidence which have previously been 
  established beyond a reasonable doubt &#133;. The kind of charge argued for 
  by the appellants is facially inconsistent with these principles, and no persuasive 
  reason has been advanced which would justify creating an exception for evidence 
  of post-offence conduct.</p>
<p>
  [34] In light of White, the trial judge's charge in the present case on this 
  issue was, understandably, in error. However, it was an error that benefitted 
  the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [35] For these reasons, I conclude that the trial judge did not err in admitting 
  evidence of the post-offence conduct of the appellant. Moreover, his charge 
  to the jury on this issue was, with one exception that benefitted the appellant, 
  sound.</p>
<p> (2) False alibi<a href="#a">[5]</a><a name="5"></a> </p>
<p>
  [36] At the trial, the Crown alleged that between 1:30 and 3:00 p.m. on the 
  afternoon after the murder, the appellant returned to the deceased's apartment 
  to 'stage' the murder scene to make it appear as if the murder had been sexually 
  motivated and to remove some of his personal belongings to make it seem as if 
  he had moved out the previous night. The Crown led evidence from three witnesses 
  who testified that they saw the appellant in the apartment building between 
  1:55 and 3:00 p.m. One of the witnesses, Gity Haghnegahdar, testified that she 
  saw the appellant leaving the deceased's apartment at 3:00 p.m. In addition, 
  David Misener, a security guard at Canada Post, testified that he saw the appellant 
  at Canada Post at 4:00 p.m. after the appellant's shift was over (it ended at 
  3:30 p.m.) and that the appellant was behaving unusually, wanting to be seen 
  in the company of others in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>
  [37] Based on this and other evidence, in his closing address Crown counsel 
  advanced the argument that the crime scene at the deceased's apartment had been 
  'staged', that the only person who would have staged the crime scene was the 
  killer, that the appellant was the only person with the opportunity and motive 
  to stage the crime scene (a stranger would have no motive to return approximately 
  12 hours after the murder), and that the appellant had in fact returned to the 
  deceased's apartment "under the cover of work" on the afternoon of 
  October 14 "hoping to have an alibi" for his activities in the apartment.</p>
<p>
  [38] The appellant testified that he went to work at Canada Post on October 
  14. He admitted that he went to the deceased's apartment building that afternoon. 
  However, he said that he went there after work, not between 1:55 and 3:00 p.m. 
  He also testified that he did not go up to the deceased's apartment; rather 
  he returned to the building only to retrieve his car which he had left in the 
  underground parking garage the previous night. In support of his testimony, 
  the appellant introduced evidence indicating that his office computer was being 
  used for most of the 1:55 - 3:00 p.m. period, including at 3:00 p.m. when Gity 
  Haghnegahdar said she saw him leaving the deceased's apartment. In addition, 
  the appellant produced Canadian Tire and parking receipts that suggested he 
  was not at Canada Post after 4:00 p.m.</p>
<p>
  [39] The appellant contends that the Crown closing address embraced inappropriate 
  speculation about the evidence concerning his activities on the afternoon of 
  October 14. I do not agree. There was solid evidence - from both sides - about 
  the events on the afternoon of October 14. The trial judge properly admitted 
  it. None of it was determinative of whether the appellant returned to the deceased's 
  apartment and 'staged' the crime scene.</p>
<p>
  [40] To take but one example, the appellant's forceful submission that the computer 
  records at Canada Post conclusively established he was at work at 3:00 p.m. 
  is undercut by evidence that supervisors sometimes shared computer passwords, 
  that someone else used the appellant's password on at least one other occasion, 
  and by the appellant's own testimony that the records showing that he was logged 
  on to the computer for almost five hours on October 14 "couldn't possibly" 
  be correct.</p>
<p>
  [41] Finally, the trial judge's charge to the jury on this issue was comprehensive, 
  balanced and legally sound. He stated that two issues relating to whether the 
  appellant was the person who killed the deceased were whether the appellant 
  had the opportunity to be absent from his workplace at the time in question 
  and whether he went to the deceased's apartment that afternoon. He then reminded 
  the jury of the positions of the parties concerning those issues and conducted 
  a full and fair review of the evidence. Importantly, the trial judge expressly 
  advised the jury that, while it was entitled to draw reasonable inferences, 
  it could not draw inferences based on "mere speculation or hunches". 
  Defence counsel made no objection to any of the trial judge's charge on this 
  issue.</p>
<p>
  [42] In summary, the evidence about the appellant's activities on the afternoon 
  of October 14 was admissible. Crown counsel did not make inappropriate submissions 
  concerning this evidence in his closing address to the jury. The trial judge's 
  jury charge on this issue was appropriate.</p>
<p>
  (3) Similar fact evidence</p>
<p>
  [43] Gity Haghnegahdar testified that, from her apartment across the hall, she 
  heard someone banging on Donna Hunter's apartment between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m. 
  on the night Ms. Hunter was murdered. After a few minutes, she heard Ms. Hunter 
  open the door to admit the person banging on her door. The appellant testified 
  that he left the deceased's apartment at 12:30 a.m. and did not return.</p>
<p>
  [44] The trial judge admitted the evidence of Darlene Oliphant, a former girlfriend 
  of the appellant, and Sharon Weeden, a friend who was staying at Ms. Oliphant's 
  apartment, who testified that the appellant came to Ms. Oliphant's apartment 
  a day after she had terminated their relationship and caused a ruckus while 
  demanding entry. In admitting Ms. Oliphant's and Ms. Weeden's testimony as similar 
  fact evidence, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Although most of the evidence of the prior relationship is, in my view, not 
  sufficiently relevant to the issue before us, I have concluded that the evidence 
  of the behaviour of the accused when he returned to Ms. Oliphant's house demanding 
  entry after being rejected should be admitted. Because the probative value is 
  sufficiently strong and outweighs the prejudicial effect, I have concluded the 
  evidence is circumstantially relevant to the issue of identity, and I accept 
  Mr. Fisher's submission it is admissible to show a pattern of emotional involvement 
  which, when followed by rejection, turns to violence. Or, to put it another 
  way, specifically it is evidence that the Oliphant relationship can show a pattern 
  of violent behaviour engaged in by the accused when rejected by a girlfriend 
  following a serious relationship.</p>
<p>
  [45] The appellant challenges the role the Oliphant and Weeden similar fact 
  evidence played in the trial in three respects: (1) it should not have been 
  admitted; (2) Crown counsel strayed beyond the permissible uses of the evidence; 
  and (3) the trial judge's charge to the jury on this issue was inadequate.</p>
<p>
  [46] A trial judge's decision concerning the admission of similar fact evidence 
  is entitled to substantial deference: see R. v. Arp (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 
  321 (S.C.C.); R. v. Harvey (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 52 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. R.N., 
  [2003] O.J. No. 263 (C.A.); and R. v. Multani, [2004] O.J. No. 1311 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [47] I can see no basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to admit 
  the similar fact evidence in this trial. Although he did not have the benefit 
  of the leading decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in Arp and in R. v. 
  Handy (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 481, the trial judge's reasoning is faithful to 
  those decisions and his conclusion is well within their parameters.</p>
<p>
  [48] Although Crown counsel, in his questioning of witnesses and closing address, 
  occasionally strayed outside the careful limits set by the trial judge in his 
  ruling, in my view these transgressions were corrected by the clear and accurate 
  charge the trial judge gave on this issue: </p>
<p class="indent"> Some evidence that can be used only for a limited purpose is 
  as follows: the evidence of Darlene Oliphant and Sharon Weeden. You remember 
  them. Darlene Oliphant was the former girlfriend of the accused man, Stephen 
  Trochym. Sharon Weeden was her friend. They gave evidence about the break up 
  of Mr. Trochym and Darlene and how the accused man, in their version of events, 
  came back in the early morning hours, that he pounded on the door, that he called 
  Darlene names, such as "whore", "slut" and "dike", and threatened her.</p>
<p class="indent">This evidence may be used by you for a limited purpose, and 
  I will not go into it in detail now because I think you have enough rules except 
  to say this, that basically it's evidence, which you may or may not take into 
  account when you are weighing the question of who the person was at the door, 
  banging on the door in the early morning hours of October 14, that Gity Haghnegahdar 
  testified she heard. If you can decide that there was someone banging on the 
  door - and I think it is reasonable to assume there was somebody in that apartment 
  because Donna Hunter lost her life at some point. If you conclude that somebody 
  was banging on the door at that time, you are going to want to consider who 
  it was, and when you consider who it was, you may take into account the evidence 
  of Darlene Oliphant and her friend, Sharon Weeden, because that evidence of 
  what Mr. Trochym did, if you accept it, is some evidence, circumstantial evidence 
  of the identity of the person banging on the door on Wednesday, October 14. 
  But you cannot use it for some other reason, like bad character, as we talked 
  about. You cannot say, well, he is the type of person who would - if you accept 
  this evidence that he calls his ex-girlfriend names and kicked the window and 
  so on - is the type of person who would commit this crime. That would be improper 
  use of the evidence. It is for a limited use only. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>Later in his charge, the trial judge repeated, in only slightly 
  different language, this instruction about the similar fact evidence, including 
  the warning in the emphasized passage.</p>
<p>
  [49] In summary, I conclude that the similar fact evidence was admissible and 
  the transgressions of Crown counsel concerning its use were corrected by the 
  trial judge's excellent charge on this issue.</p>
<p>
  (4) Post-hypnotic statements of a Crown witness</p>
<p>
  [50] In her initial interview with the police, Gity Haghnegahdar was unclear 
  about the date she heard the banging on the deceased's apartment door and the 
  afternoon she saw the appellant leave the deceased's apartment. She agreed to 
  a police suggestion that she undergo hypnosis. Following the hypnosis, she was 
  able to fix these events as having occurred on, respectively, Wednesday, October 
  14, after midnight, and Wednesday, October 14, in the afternoon.</p>
<p>
  [51] The trial judge ruled that Ms. Haghnegahdar could testify in accordance 
  with her 'enhanced' post-hypnotic memory. Following a voir dire in which he 
  heard expert opinion evidence called by the Crown and by the defence on the 
  subject of hypnotically enhanced evidence, the trial judge delivered a comprehensive 
  and careful ruling. Following a long line of trial court decisions in several 
  provinces, including Ontario, he declined to adopt a rule excluding all hypnotically 
  enhanced evidence. He said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The rule in this situation was succinctly stated by Campbell J. in R. v. Terciera, 
  supra, at page 40: </p>
<p class="indent">
  "[T]he fact that a witness has been hypnotized is a matter that generally 
  goes to weight."</p>
<p>
  [52] The trial judge adopted the guidelines for the assessment of hypnotically 
  enhanced evidence articulated by Wachowich J. in R. v. Clark (1984), 13 C.C.C. 
  117 (Alta. Q.B.), and followed in several Ontario cases. Based on his assessment 
  of the Clark factors, the trial judge decided to admit Ms. Haghnegahdar's testimony.</p>
<p>
  [53] Following this ruling, and at the initiative of the defence, counsel agreed 
  that so long as defence counsel did not cross-examine Ms. Haghnegahdar about 
  her pre-hypnotic statements, the jury would not hear that she had been hypnotized. 
  The trial judge accepted this agreement, and it was carried into effect.</p>
<p> [54] The appellant challenges the use made of Ms. Haghnegahdar's testimony 
  on two grounds: he contends that there should be a rule of absolute exclusion 
  of all testimony based on memory enhanced by hypnosis<a href="#a">[6]</a><a name="6"></a> 
  and he submits that the trial judge erred by accepting the agreement of trial 
  counsel concerning how Ms. Haghnegahdar's testimony would be presented to the 
  jury.</p>
<p>
  [55] In the record before the trial judge, and on the basis of the case law 
  available in 1995, there was no basis for a rule of absolute exclusion of testimony 
  based on hypnotically enhanced memory. Nothing in the record before us, or in 
  developments in the case law since then, would support such a rule. Indeed, 
  such a rule would run contrary to a general theme of Canadian evidence law - 
  namely, a reluctance to deprive the finders of fact of relevant information. 
  As expressed by L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; J. in her concurring judgment in R. v. 
  L.(D.O.) (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 313: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The modern trend in this field has been to admit all relevant and probative 
  evidence and allow the trier of fact to decide the weight to be given to that 
  evidence in order to arrive at a result which will be just. A just result is 
  best achieved when the decision-makers have all relevant and probative information 
  before them. It would seem contrary to the judgments of our court (Seaboyer 
  and B.(K.G.), supra) to disallow evidence available through technological advances, 
  such as videotaping, that may benefit the truth-seeking process. Consequently, 
  adherence to such strict rules as suggested by the respondent, besides not being 
  constitutionally required, may result in valuable information not being brought 
  to the court's attention. Moreover, the court has recently sought to further 
  remove obstacles to the truth-seeking process, in a genuine attempt to return 
  to the basic goal of truth-finding: see R. v. Khan (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 92, 
  [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, 79 C.R. (3d) 1; R. v. W.(R.), supra, and R. v. Marquard, 
  S.C.C., No. 22940, October 21,1993 [reported ante, p. 193, 159 N.R. 81, 21 W.C.B. 
  (2d) 184]. Rules of evidence, as much as the law itself, are not cast in stone 
  and will evolve with time. This is amply demonstrated by even a superficial 
  overview of our legal history and the way in which rules were developed through 
  the centuries.</p>
<p>
  [56] A similar point was made more recently by Binnie J. in R. v. J.-L.J., [2000] 
  2 S.C.R. 600. In that case, the trial judge excluded expert scientific evidence. 
  The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the trial judge's exercise of discretion. 
  In the course of his reasons, Binnie J. said, at p. 616: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A case-by-case evaluation of novel science is necessary in light of the changing 
  nature of our scientific knowledge: it was once accepted by the highest authorities 
  of the western world that the earth was flat.</p>
<p>
  As such, on this record I would not accede to the appellant's request for a 
  categorical exclusionary rule.</p>
<p>
  [57] Turning to the appellant's second challenge on this issue, I see no basis 
  for concluding that the trial judge erred by accepting the agreement of trial 
  counsel concerning how Ms. Haghnegahdar's testimony would be presented to the 
  jury. The agreement was initiated by defence counsel who clearly was concerned 
  that if the jury heard that Ms. Haghnegahdar's memory had been enhanced by hypnosis, 
  this knowledge might increase her credibility in the jury's eyes. Accordingly, 
  the genesis of the agreement was very much a tactical decision by defence counsel. 
  I do not fault the trial judge for accepting the agreement. In the absence of 
  an allegation of incompetence or ineffective representation, which the appellant 
  specifically disclaims, there is no basis for interfering with the trial judge's 
  decision to accept and implement a procedure agreed to by both counsel.</p>
<p>
  (5) Cross-examination of the appellant</p>
<p>
  [58] The appellant contends that the cross-examination of the appellant by Crown 
  counsel was unfair in three respects.</p>
<p>
  [59] First, the appellant submits that Crown counsel's tone throughout the cross-examination 
  was patronizing, sarcastic, mocking and editorial. I disagree. The cross-examination 
  was detailed and vigorous. None of the adjectives submitted by the appellant 
  accurately characterize the cross-examination. Moreover, experienced defence 
  counsel objected on only one occasion during the appellant's cross-examination, 
  to a question he described as "argumentative".</p>
<p>
  [60] Second, the appellant submits that Crown counsel's closing address exceeded 
  the bounds of propriety in his use of one of the appellant's previous convictions: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Turning to the evidence that the Defence did call. Turning first to the evidence 
  of the accused, what do we know about the accused- The accused is a man with 
  a criminal record, including a 1993 conviction for breach of a bail order, an 
  offence which strikes right at the heart of the very administration of justice.</p>
<p>
  [61] It is probably an exaggeration to describe breach of a bail order in this 
  fashion. However, it is difficult to conceive of a jury, deliberating in a murder 
  case at the end of a 14 week trial, attaching any significance to an exaggeration 
  in a half-sentence. Moreover, the trial judge effectively removed four of the 
  appellant's five convictions from the jury's consideration in terms of its assessment 
  of his credibility.</p>
<p>
  [62] Third, the appellant contends that Crown counsel engaged in an unfair tactic 
  during his cross-examination of the appellant. Crown counsel asked the appellant 
  to compile a list of witnesses with whom he disagreed. As the cross-examination 
  progressed, Crown counsel would put forth testimony of a witness that contradicted 
  the appellant's evidence. If the appellant agreed that there was a contradiction, 
  the witness' name would be added to the list. By the end of the cross-examination, 
  there were 28 names on the list.</p>
<p>
  [63] I see nothing wrong with this tactic. When Crown counsel introduced the 
  list, the trial judge asked defence counsel if he had a position on its use. 
  Defence counsel did not object, so long as the list was not made an exhibit. 
  It was not. Moreover, at no time did Crown counsel cross the line and ask the 
  appellant if he thought the witnesses who contradicted him were lying or to 
  explain why they might be lying: see R. v. R.(A.J.), (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 
  168 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  (6) Burden of proof</p>
<p>
  [64] The trial judge delivered his jury charge in July 1995, well before the 
  seminal decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada dealing with the concept of 
  reasonable doubt: see R. v. Lifchus (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 and R. v. Starr 
  (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449.</p>
<p>
  [65] The appellant contends that the jury charge at his trial did not comply 
  with Lifchus and Starr in three important respects: (1) the trial judge said 
  that the term 'reasonable doubt' has a natural and ordinary meaning; (2) he 
  did not say that reasonable doubt can arise from the evidence or an absence 
  of evidence; and (3) he did not make it clear that the criminal standard of 
  proof is substantially higher than the civil standard of proof.</p>
<p>
  [66] In R. v. Rhee, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 364, Arbour J. reviewed the Lifchus charge 
  and subsequent cases in which it had been considered by the Supreme Court of 
  Canada, including Starr, R. v. Beauchamp, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 720, R. v. Russell, 
  [2000] 2 S.C.R. 731, and R. v. Avetysan, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 745. She said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Appellate review of a charge of the jury is not a mechanical task, but rather 
  an assessment of whether the deficiencies in the charge, as compared to the 
  Lifchus standard, cause serious concern about the jury's verdict. However, the 
  failure of such charges to reflect Lifchus principles "cannot be taken 
  to raise by that alone the spectre of an unfair trial or miscarriage of justice" 
  (Russell, supra, at para. 24). Rather, the key question to ask is whether the 
  charge in question substantially complies with the principles expressed in Lifchus, 
  so that, as a whole, it does not give rise to the reasonable likelihood that 
  the jury misunderstood the correct standard of proof.</p>
<p>
  [67] Based on my review of the trial judge's jury charge, I do not conclude 
  that it gave rise to a reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the 
  correct standard of proof. Indeed, although the charge does contain at least 
  two of the three defects alleged by the appellant (arguably, the trial judge's 
  instruction that the jury should acquit the accused if it had a "nagging" 
  or "lingering" doubt about his guilt properly situated the reasonable 
  doubt standard well above the civil standard of proof), there are many cases 
  in which pre-Lifchus jury charges containing all three defects have been upheld: 
  see, for example, Rhee; R. v. Feeley (2003), 171 C.C.C. 353 (S.C.C.); R. v. 
  Tavenor (2001), 140 O.A.C. 78; R. v. Satkunananthan (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 
  321 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Phillips (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 345 (Ont. C.A.); R. 
  v. Varga (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 502 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Nguyen (2002), 161 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 433 (Ont. C.A.); and R. v. Rochon (2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [68] In my view, the trial judge delivered a well-organized and well-worded 
  jury charge following a long and difficult trial. The components relating to 
  the presumption of innocence and the assessment of the credibility of witnesses 
  were accurate and are important contextual points when considering the charge 
  on reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [69] In summary, based on my review of the trial judge's jury charge and my 
  understanding of the similar cases listed above, I reach the conclusion that 
  the trial judge's charge relating to reasonable doubt complies with the test 
  set out by Arbour J. in Rhee.</p>
<p>
  (7) The proviso</p>
<p>
  [70] In light of the foregoing, the issue of the potential application of the 
  curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code does not arise.</p>
<p>
  Sentence Appeal</p>
<p>
  (8) Period of parole ineligibility</p>
<p>
  [71] The trial judge sentenced the appellant to the mandatory term of life imprisonment 
  for the offence of second degree murder. He fixed the period of parole ineligibility 
  at the statutory minimum of 10 years.</p>
<p>
  [72] The Crown contends that the period of parole ineligibility for a brutal 
  murder of an unarmed girlfriend or wife should be in the 12-15 year range: see 
  R. v. McKnight (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 41 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Wristen (1999), 
  141 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.); and R. v. McLeod, [2003] O.J. No. 3923 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [73] I do not agree, for three reasons.</p>
<p>
  [74] First, the sentence imposed by the trial judge, who has seen the accused 
  and heard all the evidence, is entitled to substantial deference: see R. v. 
  Shropshire (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [75] Second, the trial judge gave detailed reasons for sentence in which he 
  carefully considered all of the relevant factors relating to the offence and 
  the offender. In particular, the trial judge was aware of, and affected by, 
  the devastating impact of the death of Ms. Hunter on her family and friends: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The murder of Donna Hunter has robbed her loving father of his only surviving 
  child. Her murder has also robbed a young man and woman of their loving mother 
  and her loss has also deeply affected her many friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>
  [76] It is true that the trial judge did not refer specifically to the domestic 
  context of the murder. However, the trial took place in 1995. The cases relied 
  on by the Crown which attach strong weight to this factor were decided after 
  1995. Moreover, s. 718.2(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code, which specifically identifies 
  spousal abuse as an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes, did not come 
  into force until 1996. In any event, it is clear from the trial judge's reasons 
  that he regarded this as a terrible murder.</p>
<p>
  [77] Third, six members of the jury made no recommendation concerning parole 
  ineligibility and six members recommended a period of parole ineligibility of 
  10 years. The trial judge took this recommendation into account. One of the 
  overarching themes of the Crown submissions on the appellant's conviction appeal 
  is the need to repose great confidence and trust in the jury. I have essentially 
  agreed with this submission. There is an obvious irony in the Crown attempt 
  to reverse field on the sentence appeal.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [78] I would dismiss the appellant's conviction appeal and the Crown sentence 
  appeal.</p>
<p>
  RELEASED: July 5, 2004 ("MAC")</p>
<p>
  "J. C. MacPherson J.A."<br>
  "I agree: M. A. Catzman J.A."<br>
  "I agree: K. M. Weiler J.A."</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="a"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> Stephen Trochym appeals his conviction. 
  The Crown appeals against the sentence imposed by the trial judge. Hence both 
  are appellants and both are respondents. In these reasons, I will refer to Mr. 
  Trochym as the appellant.</p>
<p><a href="#2">[2]</a> The trial took place in 1995. The appeal was argued nine 
  years later. The appellant was released on bail pending his appeal in 1999. 
  The long delay in the progress of the appeal, which is unconscionable, was, 
  unfortunately, principally the result of persistent problems with a court reporter 
  who took six years to prepare the transcripts of the trial proceedings.</p>
<p><a href="#3">[3]</a> The appellant makes no allegation on this appeal that 
  he received ineffective representation at his trial. On the basis of the record, 
  there would be no basis for such an allegation.</p>
<p><a href="#4">[4]</a> I will address the &#145;staging&#146; issue in the next 
  section of these reasons under the rubric of &#145;false alibi&#146;.</p>
<p><a href="#5">[5]</a> The word &#145;alibi&#146; strikes me as a bit of a misnomer 
  for this issue because the events being considered in this section are not events 
  at the time of the murder; rather they took place more than 12 hours later. 
  However, since there is a link between the two sets of events, and since counsel 
  and the trial judge (and appellate counsel) all use the word &#145;alibi&#146; 
  as a general descriptor, I will do the same.</p>
<p><a href="#6">[6]</a> The appellant candidly concedes that if there is no absolute 
  rule of exclusion, and if the Clark guidelines are appropriate, there is no 
  basis for challenging the trial judge&#146;s application of those guidelines 
  in his ruling.</p>
