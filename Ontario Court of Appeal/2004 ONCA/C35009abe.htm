<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from the convictions by Justice Kiteley, sitting 
  with a jury, for sexual assault, sexual exploitation, gang sexual assault and 
  forcible confinement. </p>
<p>[2] The trial judge's decision to instruct the jury on the issue of DNA evidence 
  and that they should carefully consider the review of that evidence in the closing 
  addresses of counsel was done with the express consent of both counsel. Although 
  a somewhat unusual way of dealing with the evidence, we cannot say that the 
  exercise of discretion amounted to an error, particularly in light of the joint 
  position of counsel, and given the acknowledged completeness and fairness of 
  those addresses on this issue.</p>
<p>[3] In addressing some of the inferences that the Crown argued should be drawn, 
  the trial judge did not review the parties' competing theories of the case. 
  Her instructions in this regard were not an improper exercises of her discretion.
