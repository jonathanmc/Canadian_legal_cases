<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice John R. McIsaac of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on May 25, 2000.</p>
<p>
  LANG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  Inroduction </p>
<p>
  [1] After a forty-day jury trial, Mr. Edelenbos was convicted of the first degree 
  murder of Eileen Coffey. At the beginning of trial, Mr. Edelenbos admitted that 
  he had gone to Ms. Coffey's home on January 5, 1998, and sexually assaulted 
  and strangled her. His defence to murder was one of intention: he said that 
  he strangled Ms. Coffey to stop her from screaming and that he did not intend 
  to kill her, and should therefore be convicted of manslaughter.</p>
<p>
  [2] The requirement for subjective intent for murder is set out in s. 229 of 
  the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The Crown must either establish that 
  the accused intended to cause the victim's death or meant to cause bodily harm 
  "that he knows is likely to cause his [or her] death, and is reckless whether 
  death ensues or not".</p>
<p>
  [3] Mr. Edelenbos appeals his conviction submitting that the trial judge erred 
  in: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1) defining the word "likely" in his jury charge regarding 
  the intent requirement for murder;</p>
<p class="indent">2) holding that Mr. Edelenbos's common law wife was competent 
  to testify for the Crown; and</p>
<p class="indent">3) admitting evidence of the good character of the deceased.</p>
<p class="indent">[4] I would not give effect to any of these grounds of appeal. 
  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  Facts</p>
<p>
  [5] Mr. Edelenbos knew Ms. Coffey through his father, who had dated a woman 
  boarding at Ms. Coffey's home. Early on the morning of January 5, 1998, knowing 
  that Ms. Coffey's boarder was out of town, Mr. Edelenbos went to her home. He 
  did not try to enter. Instead, he went to his job at the local landfill. During 
  his shift, and immediately afterwards, he consumed some rye and beer. He returned 
  to Ms. Coffey's home at approximately 5:00 p.m. He gained entry, sexually assaulted 
  Ms. Coffey, hit her in the face, broke her nose, and strangled her. Mr. Edelenbos 
  testified that he put his hands around Ms. Coffey's neck to stop her screaming, 
  not to kill her. </p>
<p>
  [6] Afterwards, Mr. Edelenbos tried to eliminate any evidence of the killing. 
  He washed all blood from the area. He wrapped Ms. Coffey's body in a carpet 
  and put it in the back of his truck. He then returned to the house to move a 
  La-Z-Boy recliner onto Ms. Coffey's driveway. He accomplished this meticulous 
  clean-up over a prolonged period of time: his truck was in Ms. Coffey's driveway 
  for almost three hours. The home appeared to be immaculate; however, with special 
  equipment, the forensic team later detected blood, both in the home and in the 
  truck.</p>
<p>
  [7] Around 8:30 p.m., with the body in his truck, Mr. Edelenbos drove home to 
  his common law wife, Bernadette Wadden, and their six-month-old child. At trial, 
  Ms. Wadden testified that on his arrival, Mr. Edelenbos appeared to have been 
  drinking, but was not drunk. She chastised him because drinking alcohol violated 
  the terms of his parole. Shortly after his return home, Ms. Wadden let him feed 
  their child, indicating that she did not feel that Mr. Edelenbos was significantly 
  affected by his alcohol intake. Afterwards, Mr. Edelenbos had a bath and went 
  to bed.</p>
<p>
  [8] Mr. Edelenbos got up a few hours later. He drove to the landfill, where 
  he dumped Ms. Coffey's body. He used the landfill's power washer to clean the 
  back of his truck. He then returned to Ms. Coffey's residence, picked up the 
  La-Z-Boy recliner from the driveway, returned to the landfill, and dumped the 
  recliner. Various witnesses, mostly co-workers, testified at trial about Mr. 
  Edelenbos's disposal efforts. </p>
<p>
  [9] The next day, in an attempt to see if he was under suspicion, Mr. Edelenbos 
  tried to report to his parole officer. Later, he called his parole officer to 
  say he had visited Ms. Coffey the night she disappeared. Mr. Edelenbos also 
  went to the police station and provided a videotaped statement, which, at trial, 
  he admitted was false. At the time Mr. Edelenbos made his statement, the police 
  noted marks on his neck, elbow, and right wrist. He remained under police surveillance 
  until his arrest. Over the next two months, the police located both Ms. Coffey's 
  body and her recliner at the landfill.</p>
<p>
  [10] Despite the damage done to the body at the landfill, an autopsy identified 
  the cause of death as manual strangulation. As well, blunt force injuries to 
  Ms. Coffey's face and neck were detected and it was determined that her nose 
  had been broken. The jury heard evidence about the dynamics and effects of strangulation. 
  Ms. Coffey's neck injuries fell at the more severe end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>
  [11] The Crown's case against Mr. Edelenbos was strong. The principal issue 
  for determination at trial was whether the Crown had established beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that Mr. Edelenbos intended to cause Ms. Coffey bodily harm that he knew 
  was likely to cause her death, and was reckless whether death ensued or not. 
  It is in this context that we must consider the trial judge's alleged errors.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  1) Did the trial judge's charge on the meaning of "likely" constitute 
  reversible error?</p>
<p>
  [12] For the most part, the trial judge's charge to the jury followed the accepted 
  pattern regarding the intent required for murder, and the difference between 
  murder and manslaughter. However, the trial judge gave the jury a novel explanation 
  of the meaning in s. 229 of "likely" in the clause "means to 
  cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause his death". </p>
<p>
  [13] As applicable in this case, the current Ontario Specimen Jury Instructions 
  (Criminal) (Toronto: Carswell, 2002), prepared by Watt J. of the Ontario Superior 
  Court of Justice (the Watt Charges), would have had the judge tell the jury: </p>
<p class="indent"> The crime of murder requires proof of a particular state of 
  mind. For an unlawful killing to be murder, Crown counsel must prove that Mr. 
  Edelenbos meant either to kill Ms. Coffey or meant to cause Ms. Coffey bodily 
  harm that Mr. Edelenbos knew was likely to kill Ms. Coffey, and was reckless 
  whether Ms. Coffey died or not. The Crown does not have to prove both. One is 
  enough. All of you do not have to agree on the same state of mind, as long as 
  everyone is sure that one of the required states of mind has been proven beyond 
  a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="indent">If Mr. Edelenbos did not mean to do either, Mr. Edelenbos committed 
  manslaughter [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  Although the Watt Charges were not distributed until 2002, the charge often 
  used in 2000 was similar in content. It is relevant to observe that the Watt 
  Charges contain no definition of "likely". </p>
<p>
  [14] Instead of using the standard charge however, the trial judge gave the 
  following definition of "likely": </p>
<p class="indent">
  Likely means more than a possibility. It involves a substantial degree of probability. 
  However, it does not mean more likely than not in the mathematical sense of 
  51 percent. The phrase is meant to convey the notion of a substantial or real 
  chance, as distinct from a mere possibility. Likely to cause death means could 
  well cause death. A fine calculation that the odds were against death, although 
  the risk was plainly there, is no defence. By using the word "likely" 
  the legislators were trying to get at killings where the risk was subjectively 
  so appreciable that to engage in the conduct would be seen as a virtual equivalent 
  of an intentional killing. A likelihood is a real risk, a substantial risk or 
  something that might well happen.</p>
<p>
  [15] In choosing this definition, the trial judge relied on Isabel Grant, Dorothy 
  Chunn, and Christine Boyle in The Law of Homicide, looseleaf (Scarborough: Carswell, 
  1994). They argue at pages 4-44 to 4-46 that, in some circumstances, the difference 
  between knowing that death is "likely" and that death is "possible" 
  distinguishes murder from manslaughter. They look to foreign case law to support 
  this approach, particularly the New Zealand Court of Appeal decision in R. v. 
  Piri, [1987] N.Z.L.R. 66.</p>
<p>
  [16] No Canadian cases were brought to our attention that discuss the meaning 
  of "likely" in the context of s. 229. It would seem that the need 
  for such a discussion has probably not arisen. In my view, the need did not 
  arise in this case. It was unnecessary and potentially confusing to the jury 
  for the trial judge to engage in a nuanced discussion of the precise meaning 
  of "likely" in the circumstances of this trial. The facts simply did 
  not call for an analysis of where "likely" stands on the spectrum 
  from possible to probable. The jury in this case would have given the word "likely" 
  its common sense plain language meaning, as other juries have across Canada. 
  </p>
<p>
  [17] The purpose of the Ontario Specimen Criminal Jury Trial Project, chaired 
  by Watt J., was to help judges draft jury instructions in plain language. The 
  resulting Watt Charges do not include a definition of "likely" in 
  the standard murder instructions. In my view, this is because juries are able 
  to apply "likely", in accordance with its established ordinary meaning, 
  to the particular context. </p>
<p>
  [18] Where the jury does not need an analysis of a commonplace everyday word, 
  the trial judge should avoid entering into the possible shades of its meaning. 
  I recognize, however, that there may be cases where the trial judge may feel 
  that the circumstances call for elaboration or definition. If so, before providing 
  such an elaboration or definition, particularly one that has apparently not 
  been used in a Canadian context, the trial judge should so advise counsel during 
  the pre-charge conference. Each counsel should then be given an opportunity 
  to make submissions. </p>
<p>
  [19] No such opportunity was given in this case. The trial judge did not advise 
  counsel about his research in the area or his intention to depart from the standard 
  charge. At the conclusion of the charge, defence counsel objected to the instruction 
  on the meaning of "likely". The trial judge then explained his reasoning. 
  While defence counsel, at that time, did not persist with his objection, he 
  simply was not given an adequate opportunity to consider and research the matter. 
  In any event, the absence of an objection is not fatal to an appeal.</p>
<p>
  [20] As I have said, the circumstances of this case did not require an analysis 
  of the meaning of "likely"; indeed, in my view, it would be a most 
  exceptional situation that would ever require such an analysis. The issue here, 
  therefore, is whether the definition given by the judge to the jury operated 
  to the prejudice of the defence. I conclude that it did not, for five reasons.</p>
<p>
  [21] First, the challenged instruction must be considered in context. It comprised 
  three-quarters of a page in a succinct forty-five?page charge. The jury was 
  not given a copy of the jury charge to take with them into their deliberations. 
  Accordingly, the jury would not have laboured over the precise words of the 
  instruction. Rather, it would have been left with an impression of the judge's 
  definition of "likely". </p>
<p>
  [22] Second, in the course of his instruction, the judge referred to "likely" 
  as being a "substantial degree of probability", not a "mere possibility", 
  a "substantial risk", and on two occasions, as "something that 
  might well happen". While he spoke of a "real chance" or "real 
  risk", he also said murder was conduct virtually "equivalent to an 
  intentional killing", a definition consistent with the authorities: see 
  R. v. Cooper (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [23] Third, during the charge, a copy of the relevant provision of the Criminal 
  Code was projected onto a screen for the jury, including its reference to "likely" 
  to cause death. That provision does not include a definition of "likely". 
  The trial judge provided the jury with a copy of s. 229 when they retired for 
  their deliberations, while he did not give them a copy of his jury charge. </p>
<p>
  [24] Fourth, the trial judge himself used the word "likely" repeatedly 
  in his charge, showing that he assumed the term did not need repeated or complex 
  analysis. After he provided the definition of "likely", the trial 
  judge referred simply to "likely" to cause death on twelve further 
  occasions. As well, immediately after the definition, the trial judge instructed 
  the jury that "recklessness" was "redundant" or "almost 
  an afterthought". He said that, "if the Crown establishes the first 
  two elements beyond a reasonable doubt - that an accused person intended to 
  cause bodily harm and that he or she knew that it would likely cause death then 
  this by itself, or these two elements by themselves, meet the test for recklessness."</p>
<p>
  [25] Finally, the trial judge's instructions following the definition of "likely" 
  made the Crown's burden with respect to intent very clear. The trial judge instructed 
  the jury that the critical issue was whether the Crown had established beyond 
  a reasonable doubt that Mr. Edelenbos meant to cause Ms. Coffey's death or meant 
  to cause her bodily harm that he knew was "likely" to cause her death. 
  He canvassed the evidence of the effect of Mr. Edelenbos's inebriation on the 
  capacity to form intent and the need for the Crown to prove Mr. Edelenbos's 
  appropriate level of subjective intent. </p>
<p>
  [26] Quite rightly, he omitted the part of the standard jury charge that says 
  it may be inferred, as a matter of common sense, that a sane and sober person 
  usually intends to cause predictable consequences. There was evidence that Mr. 
  Edelenbos had been drinking. The trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The critical issue in this trial is whether or not the prosecutor has established 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that Martin Edelenbos either meant to cause the death 
  of Eileen Coffey, or meant to cause her bodily harm that he knew was likely 
  to cause her death. The intoxicating effect of alcohol is well known. Intoxication 
  which causes a person to cast off restraint and act in a manner in which he 
  or she would not have acted if sober affords no excuse for the commission of 
  an offence while in that state if he or she had the intent required to constitute 
  the offence. A drunken intent is nonetheless an intent. The offence of murder 
  is not committed if the accused lacked the intent to either cause the death 
  of Eileen Coffey, or to cause her bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause 
  her death. Intoxication could compromise the formation of: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The intent to cause death;</p>
<p class="indent">2. The intent to cause bodily harm; or</p>
<p class="indent">3. The appreciation that the intended bodily harm was likely 
  to cause death.</p>
<p class="indent">The Crown is entitled to prove either intent beyond a reasonable 
  doubt. If the intent to cause bodily harm for the second type of murder has 
  been so proved, then the Crown must go on and also prove beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that he knew that such bodily harm was likely to cause death. In considering 
  whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt either of these scenarios 
  you should take into account Mr. Edelenbos's consumption of alcohol, along with 
  the other facts which throw light on his state of mind at the time the offence 
  was allegedly committed.</p>
<p>
  [27] The trial judge reviewed the evidence about alcohol consumption and said: </p>
<p class="indent"> Once he assaulted Ms. Coffey he only meant to stop her screaming 
  when he put his hands, or hand on her throat. He denies either intending to 
  kill her, or intending to cause her bodily harm. He denies any appreciation 
  that his assault was likely to cause her death. He swore that the lethal nature 
  of his assault was not evident to him because of the extent of his intoxication. 
  He insists that the only intent he had was to stop her from screaming, despite 
  his concession in the sober confines of this courtroom that the obvious purpose 
  of putting one's hands around another's throat is to stop them from breathing.</p>
<p class="indent">To prove either the intent to cause death, or the intent to 
  cause bodily harm that Mr. Edelenbos knew was likely to cause death, the Crown 
  relies on [expert evidence].</p>
<p>
  [28] The judge went on to describe the expert evidence about the severity of 
  the injuries to Ms. Coffey and the evidence that Mr. Edelenbos was in sufficient 
  control to carry out a thorough clean-up after the killing.</p>
<p>
  [29] Taking into consideration the instructions given by the trial judge after 
  the definition of "likely", and reading the charge as a whole, I conclude 
  that the jury would have appreciated that the Crown was obliged to prove Mr. 
  Edelenbos's subjective intent to cause bodily harm that was likely to cause 
  Ms. Coffey's death. </p>
<p>
  [30] Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  2) Did the trial judge err in holding that Mr. Edelenbos's common law wife was 
  competent to testify for the Crown?</p>
<p>
  [31] Over the objections of the defence, Mr. Edelenbos's common law wife, Bernadette 
  Wadden, testified for the Crown. She said that Mr. Edelenbos was not significantly 
  inebriated when he came home on the evening of the killing. She also testified 
  that Mr. Edelenbos later admitted to her that he took Ms. Coffey's body to the 
  landfill. </p>
<p>
  [32] It was the defence position that the judge should have prohibited Ms. Wadden 
  from testifying for the Crown by extending the common law rule of spousal incompetence 
  for married persons to common law spouses. By doing so, the trial judge would 
  have treated common law spouses on an equal footing with married spouses. </p>
<p>
  [33] The trial judge agreed that, in violation of s. 15 of the Charter of Rights 
  and Freedoms, the common law rule created inequality between married and common 
  law spouses. He did not, however, find that common law spouses, like married 
  spouses, should therefore be prohibited from testifying for the Crown. Instead, 
  he struck down the rule of spousal incompetence in its entirety, holding that 
  both married and common law spouses should be equally competent to testify against 
  their spouses on behalf of the Crown. </p>
<p>
  [34] The trial judge correctly concluded that Ms. Wadden was competent to testify 
  for the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [35] The common law rule of spousal incompetence to testify has been judicially 
  adapted to reflect society's changing values. For instance, married persons 
  may now testify against their spouses if they are irreconcilably separated. 
  In R. v. Salituro (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 289, the Supreme of Court of Canada 
  recognized that, in such circumstances, there is no longer any matrimonial harmony 
  to protect. </p>
<p>
  [36] The Court in Salituro, however, emphasized the need to balance judicial 
  interpretation of the common law rule with legislative law reform. Iacobucci 
  J. declined to abolish the rule of spousal incompetence in its entirety, saying 
  at pp. 306-307: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Absent parliamentary intervention, I would conclude that changing the common 
  law rule to make spouses who are irreconcilably separated competent witnesses 
  for the prosecution would be appropriate. Although the principles upon which 
  this change is based would appear to favour abolishing the rule entirely and 
  making all spouses competent witnesses under all circumstances, policy considerations 
  and uncertainty as to the consequences of such a change suggest that a more 
  cautious approach is appropriate. The parties before us did not argue for such 
  a change, and in my opinion a far-reaching change of this kind is best left 
  to the legislature. However, expanding the exceptions to the common law rule 
  to include irreconcilably separated spouses is precisely the kind of incremental 
  change which the courts can and should make. The courts are the custodians of 
  the common law, and it is their duty to see that the common law reflects the 
  emerging needs and values of our society. </p>
<p>
  [37] Thirteen years later, there has been no legislative reconsideration of 
  the common law rule. Indeed, it is increasingly criticized as archaic. Nonetheless, 
  this case did not require judicial intervention on this point.</p>
<p>
  [38] Such intervention was unnecessary because, at the time of her testimony, 
  Ms. Wadden and Mr. Edelenbos were no longer common law spouses. At the beginning 
  of trial, on March 6, 2000, Ms. Wadden terminated her relationship with Mr. 
  Edelenbos when she learned that he admitted to sexually assaulting and killing 
  Ms. Coffey. On her uncontradicted evidence, she and Mr. Edelenbos were thereafter 
  irreconcilably separated. On May 2, 2000, when she testified for the Crown, 
  Ms. Wadden waived any spousal privilege. Thus, even if the common law rule of 
  spousal incompetence was extended to common law spouses, it would not apply 
  to Ms. Wadden. Ms. Wadden was competent to testify for the Crown. The trial 
  judge was correct in permitting her to do so.</p>
<p>
  3) Did the trial judge err in admitting evidence of the good character of the 
  deceased?</p>
<p>
  [39] Early in the trial, the Crown called Ms. Coffey's sister, Pauline Coffey, 
  to testify about the deceased's character and habits, including that Ms. Coffey 
  rarely drank alcohol, never screamed, and was a woman of exemplary character 
  and disposition who led an ordered life.</p>
<p>
  [40] The defence submits that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence as 
  to Ms. Coffey's character and disposition. This good character evidence, the 
  defence argues, was both irrelevant and seriously prejudicial to Mr. Edelenbos. 
  </p>
<p>
  [41] The Crown submits that the trial judge properly exercised his discretion 
  in allowing this evidence, much of which was relevant either to Mr. Edelenbos's 
  credibility or to the issue of his intent. </p>
<p>
  (i) The evidence</p>
<p>
  [42] In his initial statement to the police, Mr. Edelenbos said that Ms. Coffey 
  had a drinking problem and that she had planned to go out later on the night 
  of the killing. Neither statement was true. </p>
<p>
  [43] On these issues, the Crown called Ms. Coffey's sister, Pauline, who said 
  Ms. Coffey rarely drank alcohol and that she would have likely tidied her dinner 
  dishes if she had planned on going out later in the evening. She also described 
  Ms. Coffey's non-confrontational nature and her refusal to participate in a 
  confrontational labour strike. In testifying about this peaceful disposition, 
  Pauline Coffey said she never saw her sister act confrontationally or aggressively. 
  To the contrary, she was more likely to cry when faced with aggression. </p>
<p>
  [44] She spoke of her sister as a dedicated and committed teacher, a person 
  who was a "giver", and a person who - nearing retirement - was interested 
  in pursuing a second career in holistic medicine. </p>
<p>
  [45] She also gave biographical evidence about her deceased sister, evidence 
  about the care her sister gave to their mother during her dying days, the prolonged 
  grief Ms. Coffey experienced after their mother's death, and the addition to 
  her home of the "Rose" room, so described in honour of their mother, 
  Rose. Pauline Coffey testified that it was in this room that Ms. Coffey died.</p>
<p>
  [46] Part way through this character evidence, the defence objected. The trial 
  judge ruled: </p>
<p class="indent"> I understand the defence objection. However, I am persuaded 
  that for the purposes articulated by Mr. Flosman, specifically to put the personality 
  of Eileen Coffey before the jury as a circumstance for them to infer that she 
  reacted or probably would have reacted in a certain manner to confrontation 
  with Mr. Edelenbos, is, in my opinion, a critical issue for assessment by the 
  jury. I am satisfied that the potential prejudice of the evidence is outweighed 
  by its probative value.</p>
<p class="indent">I would instruct Mr. Flosman, however, to be discreet and be 
  careful in relation to how that issue is approached, because you could very 
  well go over the line that would cause me to revisit this ruling.</p>
<p>
  [47] At the end of this ruling, the Crown said that the evidence was also relevant 
  to refute Mr. Edelenbos's statement that Ms. Coffey had a drinking problem. 
  The trial judge responded with the following addendum to his ruling: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Well, that is an issue that has obviously been raised and the Crown has to deal 
  with it and I see that point as being a legitimate one that has to be canvassed 
  as well. But, as I indicated, this could easily go over into the area where 
  its probative value could be outweighed by prejudice and I just ask counsel 
  to be careful in the questions.</p>
<p>
  (ii) Analysis</p>
<p>
  [48] The trial judge did not err in admitting evidence that rebutted Mr. Edelenbos's 
  statements about Ms. Coffey's alleged drinking problem and her plans for later 
  that evening. That evidence was relevant to prove the falsity of the appellant's 
  statement to the police and was circumstantial evidence of his guilt.</p>
<p>
  [49] The trial judge erred, however, in admitting irrelevant evidence and evidence 
  going solely to the issue of Ms. Coffey's good character. In particular, the 
  evidence about care given to her mother and her reaction to her mother's death, 
  including her addition of the "Rose" room, was irrelevant. So too 
  was it irrelevant that Ms. Coffey had been a dedicated teacher interested in 
  holistic medicine. Further, evidence about Ms. Coffey's generally non-confrontational 
  character was not probative of how she would have reacted to an extraordinary 
  series of events, namely, Mr. Edelenbos's unexpected, violent, and unprovoked 
  sexual and physical assaults. </p>
<p>
  [50] This evidence was prejudicial to Mr. Edelenbos. Further, once the evidence 
  was admitted, the jury was not charged as to the purposes, if any, for which 
  it could be used, or cautioned against its use.</p>
<p>
  [51] The defence argues that the prejudicial effect of this good character evidence 
  with respect to the victim was exacerbated by the evidence of Mr. Edelenbos's 
  bad character, including information that he was on parole when he committed 
  this offence. Even though the trial judge cautioned the jury with respect to 
  the use to be made of the latter evidence, the defence argued that Mr. Edelenbos 
  was prejudiced by the evidence of Ms. Coffey's good character when juxtaposed 
  with the evidence of his own bad character.</p>
<p>
  (iii) Curative Proviso</p>
<p>
  [52] In light of the improper admission of parts of the good character evidence 
  concerning the deceased, the question arises whether a new trial is required, 
  or whether this is an appropriate case to apply the curative proviso. The answer 
  to this question turns on the seriousness of the prejudice occasioned by the 
  admission of the impugned evidence concerning the deceased.</p>
<p>
  [53] Section 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code is used in exceptional circumstances 
  to uphold a conviction if the court is "of the opinion that no substantial 
  wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred".</p>
<p>
  [54] Where the Crown asks this court to apply the proviso, it must establish: 
  "(i) that the error was minor and inconsequential and could not possibly 
  have affected the verdict; or (ii) that although the error was potentially serious, 
  the evidence is so overwhelming that the verdict would inevitably have been 
  the same had the jury been properly instructed": R. v. W.(L.K.) (1999), 
  138 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at para. 95 (Ont. C.A.); and see R. v. Khan (2001), 160 
  C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [55] In the circumstances of this case, the error was more than minor or inconsequential. 
  It may have caused the jury to consider Mr. Edelenbos's actions that night as 
  even more malevolent given Ms. Coffey's quiet and kind disposition. This, in 
  turn, would pose the risk that the jury may have been motivated by sympathy 
  for Ms. Coffey in deciding the case, rather than basing its determination on 
  its assessment of the admissible evidence. </p>
<p>
  [56] In my view, it is unlikely in this case that the jury resorted to such 
  prohibited reasoning. I say this for several reasons.</p>
<p>
  [57] First, the prejudice occasioned by the error was reduced by the fact that 
  Pauline Coffey's entire testimony took only seventy minutes, was given on the 
  twentieth day of a forty-day trial, and was not referenced again during the 
  balance of the trial. Further, Ms. Coffey's kind disposition was obviously irrelevant 
  to the main question that was clearly put to the jury: Mr. Edelenbos' intention. 
  From the outset, this case was only about Mr. Edelenbos's intention at the time 
  of strangling Ms. Coffey. </p>
<p>
  [58] Second, while Mr. Edelenbos claimed that his only purpose in choking Ms. 
  Coffey was to stop her screaming, the forensic evidence belied this explanation. 
  That evidence included details about the number and extent of traumatic injuries 
  to her throat and neck area. Those physical injuries fell at the severe end 
  of the spectrum. Mr. Edelenbos's explanation of his efforts to stop Ms. Coffey's 
  screaming made little sense. They were in her detached home and Mr. Edelenbos 
  knew that no one else was in the home. </p>
<p>
  [59] Third, the evidence established that Mr. Edelenbos planned the attack on 
  Ms. Coffey. He waited until her boarder was out of town. He stalked her on the 
  morning of the attack. He later gained entry to her home and assaulted her. 
  He knew she could identify him. He admitted that he killed her and, thereafter, 
  hid her body in the landfill.</p>
<p>
  [60] Thus, Mr. Edelenbos' admitted conduct resulted in a formidable case for 
  the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [61] In addition, on the question of intention, Mr. Edelenbos's primary position 
  at trial rested on the argument that his alcohol consumption left him unable 
  to form the necessary intent. His conduct, however, which was relevant to his 
  state of mind and his ability to form the requisite intent, said otherwise. 
  He spent several hours in the home thoroughly and efficiently attempting to 
  remove all signs of the crime. He then went home and fed his child. He was not 
  too intoxicated to do so. The jury clearly did not accept that Mr. Edelenbos 
  was so impaired as to be unable to form the requisite intention.</p>
<p>
  [62] Finally, the jury was properly charged and clearly told that the issue 
  was the "subjective intent of the attacker" and "what the aggressor 
  had in his or her mind by way of intention at the time of the assault". 
  It was also told about the need for the Crown to prove specifics about the accused's 
  intention. The jury was cautioned at length about the potential effects of alcohol 
  on Mr. Edelenbos's ability to form the requisite intention. The jury obviously 
  concluded, on this overwhelming evidence, that Mr. Edelenbos formed the requisite 
  intent.</p>
<p>
  [63] Accordingly, assuming that a trial proceeded without the admission of Pauline 
  Coffey's good character evidence about her sister, it is my view that the Crown 
  has met its onus of demonstrating that the remainder of the evidence about Mr. 
  Edelenbos's intent was so overwhelming that any new trial would inevitably result 
  in the same conviction. No miscarriage of justice has occurred; the proviso 
  applies. </p>
<p>
  Conclusion </p>
<p>
  [64] For the reasons given, I do not accept any of the appellant's three grounds 
  of appeal. In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
