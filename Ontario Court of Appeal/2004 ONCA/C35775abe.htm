<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are not satisfied that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence in 
  respect of exhibit 4. It was open to him to conclude that it was clearly fraudulent 
  in that it did not reflect the transaction even as described by the appellant. 
  In any event, we do not consider the reference to exhibit 4 as central to the 
  trial judge's disposition. He rejected the appellant's evidence primarily because 
  it was inconsistent with the appellant's admitted mode of practice.</p>
<p>[2] The conviction appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>[3] The challenged term of the probation order was agreed to by counsel, is 
  not punitive and has some rehabilitative potential. The appeal is dismissed.</p>
