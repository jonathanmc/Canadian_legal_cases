<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, this sentence including the period of parole ineligibility 
  was fit and there were no errors in principle.</p>
<p class="indent">1. The agreed statements of fact was unambiguous that the appellant 
  conspired to import 100 kilograms. We see no reason to go behind that statement 
  and the trial judge was entitled to act upon it.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Together with the unexpired remanet the appellant is subject 
  to a very lengthy sentence. However, the circumstances of this case are so unusual 
  that a lengthy consecutive sentence was required given the appellant's record, 
  the breadth of the conspiracy and the need for deterrence and to protect the 
  public.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The disparity with the other co-accused was fully justified. 
  Gumbs was a person of otherwise good character. Mr. Cain played only a minor 
  role in all of the offences. By contrast, the appellant was a career criminal 
  and the mastermind of these offences.</p>
<p class="indent">4. This was such a remarkable case that the period of parole 
  ineligibility was appropriate. The fact that the appellant has consistently 
  violated probation, parole and interim release was an appropriate factor to 
  consider. See R. v. Goulet (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 61 (Ont. C.A.) at 67. The 
  order was required for purposes of deterrence and denunciation.</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, while leave to appeal is granted the appeal from sentence 
  is dismissed.</p>
