<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the trial judge was very much alive to the inconsistencies 
  in the evidence of the complainant. In our opinion, the trial judge carefully 
  considered those inconsistencies in relation to her credibility.</p>
<p>[2] We have considered the fresh evidence while not deciding its admissibility. 
  In our view, the fresh evidence does not assist the appellant in any significant 
  manner because the fresh evidence consists of simply one more witness giving 
  evidence that was either identical or of the same type of evidence already heard 
  by the trial judge.</p>
<p>[3] The appeal as against conviction is therefore dismissed. Leave to appeal 
  sentence is granted but that appeal as against sentence is dismissed.</p>
