<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are not persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence of 
  the appellant and, in our view, it was open to him to find that the appellant 
  gave contradictory evidence.</p>
<p>[2] With respect to the WD issue, while we accept that the trial judge could 
  have been somewhat more careful in the language he used, we do not believe that 
  he approached the case on an &quot;either/or basis&quot;. At p. 15 of his reasons, 
  the trial judge stated that he had weighed all of the evidence and having done 
  so, he was satisfied that the Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable 
  doubt. It is apparent to us, when the reasons are read fairly as a whole, that 
  at the end of the day, the trial judge rejected the appellant's evidence and 
  he accepted the evidence of the two complainants. In doing so, he applied the 
  proper principles in assessing both the credibility and reliability of their 
  testimony. </p>
<p>[3] In concluding that the complainants were telling the truth, the trial judge 
  was on solid ground. The two young complainants described similar incidents 
  involving the appellant and collusion was not a live factor in assessing their 
  evidence. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
