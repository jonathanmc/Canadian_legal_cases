<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This appeal involves the interpretation of a contract. Most of the key 
  facts are not in issue. Cara submits that the contract required the landlord 
  to complete the building in accordance with the schedule attached to the lease 
  and that if after giving notice that the building was completed anything in 
  the schedules was not complete Cara was entitled to terminate the contract subject 
  to the requirement that it act in good faith. In our opinion the trial judge 
  correctly found that the contract required Cara, in the exercise of good faith, 
  to consider the other options in the contract namely, the completion of the 
  building by Cara and the deduction of this amount from the rent or billing the 
  landlord. The trial judge found that having regard to the stage construction 
  had reached and the reasons why the landlord's work had not been fully completed, 
  Cara had acted unreasonably in failing to consider the other two options available 
  to it. It was open to the trial judge to reach the conclusion that Cara therefore 
  did not proceed in good faith, failed to use best efforts to achieve the business 
  objectives of the agreement, and acted on irrelevant considerations. We would 
  accordingly dismiss the appeal with respect to liability. </p>
<p>[2] With respect to damages, we see no error in the trial judge's discretion 
  in assessing the damages on the basis of a portion of the lease. However, we 
  are of the opinion that the trial judge erred in failing to deduct from the 
  amount of rent payable under the lease the $50,000 that would have been required 
  to complete the building. Thus, the appeal with respect to damages is allowed 
  in part to the extent indicated and the cross-appeal is dismissed. Based on 
  the landlord's failure to mitigate we see no merit in the cross-appeal on damages 
  and it is dismissed. </p>
<p>[3] Having regard to the fact success on the appeal was divided, costs of the 
  appeal are to the respondent and are fixed in the amount of $5000. </p>
