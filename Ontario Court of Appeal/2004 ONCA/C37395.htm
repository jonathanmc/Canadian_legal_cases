    that if Mr. Schofield were appointed, Mr. Kieran would want an international 
    posting to one of Ingrams companies abroad. In explaining his perspective,

    cases, there was an apparent lack of similar employment in their respective

    On the facts of this case, including Mr.&nbsp;Kierans relative youth and

    that Mr. Kieran was not obligated to mitigate his damages by taking the alternate 
    position offered to him by Ingram Worldwide. That international position, 
    as the parties agreed, amounted to constructive dismissal. The proposed terms 
    of employment were not a reasonable alternative. Further, while Ingram says 
    that Mr. Kieran could have avoided the loss of his stock options had he accepted
