<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We see no merit in the appeal against the conviction for impaired driving 
  and dangerous driving. In our view, the summary conviction appeal judge did 
  not err in dismissing the appeal on those counts on the ground that there was 
  evidence before the trial judge capable of supporting the conviction and that 
  the case essentially turned on credibility.</p>
<p>[2] However, we accept the appellant's submissions that the court below erred 
  in law with respect to the count of assault with intent to resist arrest on 
  which Rosenberg J.A. granted leave to appeal. In our view, on the facts found 
  by the trial judge, there was no assault. The appellant was attempting to disengage 
  from physical contact with the police officers who were attempting to arrest 
  him and exerting considerable physical force against him. The act of pulling 
  his arm away from the police officers did not, in law, amount to an assault. 
  The appellant's action almost certainly amounted to an offence under s. 129 
  of the Criminal Code, but not assault resisting arrest, the offence charged.</p>
<p>[3] The appeal against sentence is moot and was not pursued. </p>
<p>[4] Accordingly we grant leave to appeal in the impaired driving and dangerous 
  driving counts but dismiss those appeals. The conviction for assault resisting 
  arrest is set aside.</p>
