<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] While there was some unfortunate editorial comments by Crown counsel during 
  the cross-examination of the appellant, we do not believe that these comments 
  affected the fundamental fairness of the trial.</p>
<p>[2] At no time did very experienced defence counsel seek a mistrial in relation 
  to any comments by Crown counsel during the course of the trial.</p>
<p>[3] With respect to the appellant's submission as to the alleged unfairness 
  of the Crown's closing address to the jury, it perhaps was inappropriate for 
  Crown counsel to make a number of references to the appellant as being &quot;a 
  gun toting hot head&quot;. However, the trial judge specifically instructed 
  the jury that the Crown's language was &quot;inflammatory&quot;, &quot;inappropriate&quot;, 
  &quot;intemperate&quot; and indeed should be ignored and he further instructed 
  the jury that the Crown counsel himself conceded this fact. While the trial 
  judge did not make these comments early in his charge as requested by defence 
  counsel, we are of the opinion that his instructions were adequate in the circumstances 
  and defence counsel did not object to those instructions.</p>
<p>[4] In our opinion, the jury instructions given by the trial judge in total 
  were very fair, comprehensive and adequately addressed the other concerns of 
  the appellant in relation to the conduct of Crown counsel.</p>
<p>[5] Considering the evidence as a whole, we cannot conclude that the verdicts 
  of the jury were unreasonable. Specifically, we do not find that there was any 
  inconsistency between the verdict of second degree murder and the verdict of 
  discharging a firearm with intent to wound.</p>
<p>[6] With respect to the sentence appeal, we are of the view that the trial 
  judge was not required to accept the recommendation of five of the jurors and 
  that the sentence does not reflect any error in principle.</p>
<p>[7] The appeal as to conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal as to sentence 
  is allowed but that appeal is dismissed.</p>
