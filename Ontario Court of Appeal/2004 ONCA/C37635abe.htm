<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the trial judge properly charged the jury on the elements 
  required for first degree murder. The charge clearly requires that the jury 
  conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder be planned and deliberate. 
  This can only mean that the murder be the product of planning and deliberation.</p>
<p>[2] By the time the jury reached the issue of planning and deliberation, there 
  were only two possibilities at play: that the murder was planned and deliberate 
  or spur of the moment. Both were properly put to the jury.</p>
<p>[3] Thus there was neither misdirection or non direction as to first degree 
  murder. This ground of appeal must fail.</p>
<p>[4] Mr. Green correctly acknowledges that this being so, we need not deal with 
  his argument concerning provocation.</p>
<p>[5] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
