<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Liability for the payment of occupation rent began with the Court's finding 
  of a conspiracy to acquire the assets of Dora Herberman in which both Lillian 
  and Gerald were found to have participated. Sheryl was not part of the conspiracy. 
  The trial judge fixed the liability for the payment of occupation rent on the 
  parents. There was no finding of joint and several liability. Clearly implicit 
  in his reasons is the trial judge's conclusion that effectively the tenants 
  were the respondent's parents and that she was simply living with them. It was 
  open to the trial judge to take this view of the facts and to find that it was 
  the parents not the daughter who was liable for occupation rent until the delivery 
  of possession. We see no reason to interfere with the judgment of Carnwath J. 
  and Spiegel J. correctly interpreted the trial judgment on the issue of occupation 
  rent. Both appeals are dismissed. Costs for both appeals together fixed at $2,500 
  are inclusive.</p>
