    a general contractor who did home renovations in Toronto.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Following his trial before a judge sitting 
    without a jury, he was convicted of six counts of fraud in relation to contracts 
    entered into with homeowners between July and October 1999.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The trial judge sentenced him to nine months 
    imprisonment and ordered restitution in the total amount of $42,083.<span

    sentence. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The main issue on the conviction appeal is 
    whether the trial judge erred in finding that the evidence on any one count 
    was admissible as evidence on the other counts.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    separately for each count, the appellant submits that the verdict is unreasonable 
    on four of the six counts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, 
    although not argued orally, the appellant submits in his factum that the trial 
    judge erred in his assessment of the Crowns burden of proof. On the sentence 
    appeal, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant 
    a conditional sentence and in his calculation of the quantum of the restitution 
    order. </span></p>

    in the summer, the appellant obtained deposits, began and completed significant 
    portions of the renovations, at times negotiated with the owners regarding 
    extras and further payments, but then ultimately abandoned the sites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>As the summer wore on, the appellant entered into more contracts and

    </span>In discussing the requirement that there be a sufficient degree of

  <p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>The 
    issue in the present case is not identification but the <i>actus reus </i>of 
    the offence. The point is not that the degree of similarity in such a case 
    must be <i>higher </i>or <i>lower </i>than in an identification case. The 
    point is that the issue is <i>different, </i>and the drivers of cogency in 
    relation to the desired inferences will therefore not be the same. As Grange 
    J.A. correctly pointed out 20 years ago in <i>R. v. Carpenter </i>(1982), 
    142 D.L.R. (3d) 237 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 244:</span></p>

  <p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>If, 
    for example, the complainant in this case had not been able to identify the 
    respondent as the perpetrator of the alleged offence, the conduct described 
    by the ex-wife was not so particular and distinctive as to amount to a signature 
    or fingerprints at the scene of the crime that would safely differentiate 
    him from other possible assailants. </span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US>On 
    the other hand, in a case where the issue is the <i>animus </i>of the accused 
    towards the deceased, a prior incident of the accused stabbing the victim 
    may be admissible even though the victim was ultimately shot  the accused 
    says accidentally (Rosenberg, <i>supra </i>[<i>Evidence of Similar Acts and 
    Other Extrinsic Misconduct</i>, in National Criminal Law Program, <i>Criminal 
    Evidence</i> (1994), section 8.1], at p. 8).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
