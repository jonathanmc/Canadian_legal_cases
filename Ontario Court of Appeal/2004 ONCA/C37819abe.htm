<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The Crown concedes that the appeal as to conviction should be allowed with 
  respect to the charge of conspiracy to traffic and that a verdict of acquittal 
  be substituted. We agree.</p>
<p>[2] The appeal as to the two convictions of trafficking is dismissed as we 
  see no merit in this appeal as the identification evidence was overwhelming.</p>
<p>[3] The Crown also concedes that the sentence must be reduced given the acquittal 
  on the conspiracy charge and agrees that the sentence be reduced to time served 
  which was the equivalent of 14 months.</p>
<p>[4] In the circumstances we agree with the Crown's submissions. Leave to appeal 
  sentence granted, the appeal is allowed and the sentence is reduced to time 
  served.</p>
