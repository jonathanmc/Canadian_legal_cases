<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Assuming, without deciding, that the trial judge was required to put the 
  defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent, we were not persuaded that 
  the trial judge erred in her instruction to her jury. We do not accept the submission 
  that when instructing the jury on recklessness, it was necessary, in the context 
  of this case, for the trial judge to qualify the degree of risk known to the 
  appellant that the complainant was not consenting. Read as a whole, we are satisfied 
  that the instructions did not invite the jury to apply an objective standard 
  nor did it place the onus of proof on the appellant with respect to honest belief 
  in consent.</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
