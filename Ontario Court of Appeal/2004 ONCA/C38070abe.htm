<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We see no merit in the appeal. On appeal, the stay of proceedings argument 
  was limited to the kidnapping charge. In the circumstances, the decision of 
  the Crown to proceed with the kidnapping charge in Ontario even though a related 
  kidnapping charge had been dismissed at a preliminary hearing in Montreal when 
  the complainant refused to testify cannot be criticized much less be said to 
  be an abuse of process.</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge's decision to exclude questions relating to the complainant's 
  work as a prostitute several months after the relevant events was appropriate. 
  The questions had virtually no probative value.</p>
<p>[3] The Vetrovec warning was satisfactory and was not diminished by the subsequent 
  comments relating to the testing of the credibility of all witnesses.</p>
<p>[4] There were numerous reasons for distinguishing between the sentence imposed 
  on the appellant and that imposed on the co-accused. The sentence was fit.</p>
<p>[5] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
