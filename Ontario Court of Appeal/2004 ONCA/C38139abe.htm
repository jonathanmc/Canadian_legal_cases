<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We have not been persuaded that the verdict is unreasonable. The victim 
  described his assailant as having a husky build, short hair, plaid shirt, twenty-five 
  and intoxicated. The appellant was found in the area twenty minutes after the 
  attack. He matched the description given by the victim in all particulars, except 
  that he was described as having alcohol on his breath rather than being intoxicated. 
  Moreover, he had scratches on his chest and told police he had been in a fight. 
  The victim immediately recognized the appellant as his assailant when he saw 
  him with the police. The trial judge properly dealt with the minor inconsistencies 
  in his reasons.</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
