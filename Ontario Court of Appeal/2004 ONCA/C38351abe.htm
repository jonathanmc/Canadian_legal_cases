<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We see no basis for interfering with the discretion exercised by the trail 
  judge. The Crown concedes that the granting of a stay is discretionary and, 
  as such, is entitled to considerable deference. </p>
<p>[2] These charges arose out of incidents that occurred in 1990 and 1991. Both 
  the complainant and the police decided not to pursue an investigation when these 
  matters were brought to the police's attention in 1992. Charges were not laid 
  until 2000 when the police were investigating the accused on other matters and 
  were, fortuitously, contacted by the complainant for no related purpose.</p>
<p>[3] According, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
