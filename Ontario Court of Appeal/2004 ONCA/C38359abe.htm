<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant argues that the exchanges between the court and counsel during 
  closing arguments reveal a reasonable apprehension of bias. Counsel says it 
  could be reasonably concluded that the judge had decided that the appellant 
  was guilty.</p>
<p>[2] We disagree. Counsel carries the burden of demonstrating a reasonable apprehension 
  of bias. Some of the trial judge's comments were discourteous, others were unnecessary. 
  They did not however suggest bias but rather an appreciation of the formidable 
  evidence against the appellant.</p>
<p>[3] The reasons for judgment do not support the claim that the trial judge 
  misused the &quot;licence plate&quot; evidence. The appeal is dismissed.</p>
