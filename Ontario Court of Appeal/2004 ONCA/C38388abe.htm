<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We disagree with the appellant's submission that the verdict should be 
  set aside as unreasonable. The sole issue for the jury was the identity of the 
  person responsible for the killing. In our view, there was a sufficient body 
  of evidence upon which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably and judicially, 
  could conclude that the appellant was that person. Specifically, there was eyewitness 
  evidence, evidence of motive and opportunity, evidence of after-the-fact conduct 
  pointing to the appellant's guilt and most significantly, forensic evidence 
  implicating him as the perpetrator.</p>
<p>[2] As for the trial judge's charge, we would not give effect to the one concern 
  raised by the appellant. There is no basis for thinking that the jury would 
  have confused the trial judge's recitation of the Crown's position with the 
  trial judge's opinion as to the appellant's guilt.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
