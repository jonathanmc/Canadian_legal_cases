<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the record before us falls far short of demonstrating a reasonable 
  apprehension of bias on the part of the trial judge. The trial judge did not 
  err in the manner in which he approached the assessment of the credibility of 
  the witnesses. On the evidence, he was entitled to find that the respondent 
  had not been terminated for cause and, therefore, was wrongfully dismissed. 
  We find no reason to interfere with the trial judge's assessment of damages. 
  Leave to appeal costs is refused.</p>
<p>[2] The appeal is dismissed. Costs on a partial indemnity basis fixed at $7,000 
  including disbursements and GST.</p>
