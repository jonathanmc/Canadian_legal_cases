<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants, the Shawn Krieser Trust and the Ryan Krieser Trust, appeal 
  the judgment of Ground J., sitting as a bankruptcy judge, dated June 10, 2002. 
  The bankruptcy judge dismissed an appeal from the decision of Registrar Sproat 
  confirming the decision of the trustee to disallow the proofs of claims advanced 
  by the trusts. In dismissing the appeal, the bankruptcy judge described the 
  appeal and related proceedings brought by the appellants, through Stephen Beaumont, 
  a trustee of the trusts, as &quot;an ongoing abuse of the process of the bankruptcy 
  court.&quot;</p>
<p>[2] We agree with the conclusion reached by Ground J. that on this record there 
  is no evidence that the two cheques made out to the trusts and apparently deposited 
  into a numbered company controlled by the bankrupt were intended by the trusts 
  to be loans to the company or to the bankrupt. Whatever the deposit slips may 
  evidence, it is not a loan or loans.</p>
<p>[3] We would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs on the partial indemnity 
  scale fixed in the amount of $5,000 and payable in the same manner as ordered 
  by Ground J., by the trusts and Stephen Beaumont personally on a joint and several 
  basis.</p>
<p>Signed: &quot;K. Feldman J.A.&quot;</p>
