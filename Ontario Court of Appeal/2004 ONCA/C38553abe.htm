<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The trial judge made findings of fact that the parties agreed that the 
  appellant would buy and the respondent would sell the latter's interest in Prince 
  Diamonds; that all of the material terms were concluded; and that he could fairly 
  imply a term that the transaction would be structured by the accountant, Rutman, 
  in a manner that would be as tax neutral as possible. There was evidence before 
  him on which he could fairly make those findings and draw that inference.</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of 
  $10,000.00, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
