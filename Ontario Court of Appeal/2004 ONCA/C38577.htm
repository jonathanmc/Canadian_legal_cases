  <p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;'>Here the state is 
    not using its coercive power to compel production in ways which invoke s. 
    8 of the Charter (&quot;unreasonable search or seizure&quot;). <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nor does the present case raise Parliament's 
    specific concerns in ss. 278.1 to 278.9 about protecting the confidential

    of sexual offences.</i> (See s. 278.5(2)(f) and (g).)<span style="mso-spacerun:

    </span> In view of the wording of ss. 278.1 to 278.9 and the holding in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Shearing</i>, 
    I have little doubt that those sections do not apply to records already lawfully 
    in the possession of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As 
    Binnie J. points out in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Shearing</i>, 
    the procedure in those sections concerns production of records, not their 
    use or admissibility.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That is not to say that in measuring the prejudicial 
    effect of the use of the records under the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    a trial judge cannot at least take into account the complainant’s very high 
    privacy interests in records relating to a therapeutic relationship. See <i>R.

    </span> In any event, it is not necessary to finally decide this issue since 
    I am satisfied that the trial judge was right to exclude the evidence on the 
    basis that its prejudicial effect substantially outweighed its probative value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>As the trial judge found, the Fair report had only slight probative 
    value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of the matters upon which 
    the appellant sought to cross-examine the complainant, such as her animus 
    towards the appellant, had already been fully disclosed through other means, 
    such as K.C.’s statements to the police and cross-examination of K.C. at trial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The appellant also sought to cross-examine K.C. on the manner in which 
    she described the abuse as related in the Fair report.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>For example, she is reported to have said that the appellant never 
    “hurt” her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, in context, it 
    is apparent that the “hurt” refers to physical injury, not sexual abuse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The appellant also wanted to cross-examine the complainant on the fact 
    that as reported by Mr. Fair, when asked what was the “grossest thing” that 
    the appellant did, K.C. said it was watching child pornography on the Internet 
    involving sexual activity with children.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Again, in context, this comment attributed 
    to the complainant does not detract from her complaints of sexual abuse by

    a court of appeal, in determining whether the trier of fact could reasonably 
    have reached the conclusion that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable 
    doubt, must re-examine, and to some extent at least, reweigh and consider 
    the effect of the evidence. The only question remaining is whether this rule 
    applies to verdicts based on findings of credibility. In my opinion, it does. 
    The test remains the same: could a jury or judge properly instructed and acting 
    reasonably have convicted? That said, in applying the test the Court of Appeal 
    should show great deference to findings of credibility made at trial. This 
    court has repeatedly affirmed the importance of taking into account the special 
    position of the trier of fact on matters of credibility: … The trial judge 
    has the advantage, denied to the appellate court, of seeing and hearing the 
    evidence of witnesses. However, as a matter of law it remains open to an appellate 
    court to overturn a verdict based on findings of credibility where, after 
    considering all the evidence and having due regard to the advantages afforded 
    to the trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is unreasonable.</p>

    First, there were two significant inconsistencies that went to the core of 
    C.C.’s allegations. By the time of trial, he had no recollection of the use 
    of chocolate syrup and he now alleged only one incident. He provided no explanation 
    for these significant discrepancies and, significantly, the trial judge did 
    not find any explanation. These discrepancies were not in respect of minor 
    or peripheral matters. Second, the allegations date back to when C.C. was 
    only five years of age and the manner in which his memory was revived, through 
    the “truth or dare” game, tends to undermine the reliability of the allegations. 
    Finally, unlike the case with K.C., there is not a single piece of evidence 
    to support the allegations. The trial judge did not explain why C.C.’s evidence 
    would be found reliable in the light of these significant problems.<span

    </span> In my view, the global sentence was within the appropriate range for 
    sexual abuse of two children with whom the appellant was in a position of
