<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree with the trial judge that if the exculpatory utterance went before 
  the jury, the entire context had to be put before the jury as well. In the light 
  of the position taken by defence counsel at trial (which was not the position 
  advanced on appeal) we are not persuaded that we should interfere with the trial 
  judge's ruling. The conviction appeals are therefore dismissed.</p>
<p>[2] On the sentence appeals, counsel for the appellants fairly acknowledge 
  that the four years jail terms are within the range for importing this amount 
  of cocaine. The fresh evidence concerning each appellant is very positive, for 
  which they are to be commended. However, we agree with the Crown that this evidence 
  does not afford a basis to reduce what are otherwise demonstrably fit sentences.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, although leave to appeal sentence is granted, the sentence 
  appeals are dismissed.</p>
