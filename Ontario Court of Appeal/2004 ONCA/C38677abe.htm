<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant raised three points in connection with this appeal: (i) insolvency 
  as of November 5, 1999; (2) replacement of an earlier general security agreement 
  with the G.S.A. executed on that date; and (3) the two vehicles that were transferred 
  out of the bankrupt company to the appellant and his wife. </p>
<p>[2] All of these matters were canvassed by the trial judge, who made findings 
  against the appellant that were supported by the evidence. In our view, she 
  committed no palpable and overriding error in making these findings, which are 
  fatal to the position advanced on behalf of the appellant on this appeal.</p>
<p>[3] The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed in the sum of $5,000 plus disbursements 
  and G.S.T.</p>
