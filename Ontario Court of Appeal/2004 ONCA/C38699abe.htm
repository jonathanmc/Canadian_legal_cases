<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant bases its appeal on the proposition that the trial judge 
  erred in law in his application of the law of fiduciary obligations to a situation 
  where parties are negotiating towards an agreement. In our view, the trial judge 
  properly set out the test for finding a fiduciary duty existed. In his application 
  of the test to the facts as he found them, we can see no palpable or overriding 
  error. He was entitled to conclude, as he did, in paragraph 105 of the reasons 
  that: </p>
<p class="indent">In the context of the relationship between Sarcanin on behalf 
  of Key and Zovko, who talked about a syndicate, nothing more, there is nothing 
  that could extend to a fiduciary-like duty or an obligation on the part of Zovko 
  to ensure that Key be entitled to the profits from Ibler Square. The claim for 
  relief under this heading is denied. None of the indicia of a fiduciary duty 
  are present. Key did not repose trust of anything of a confidential nature to 
  Zovko. Key was not vulnerable in the sense referred to in the cases.</p>
<p>[2] We would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs fixed in the amount of 
  $8,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
