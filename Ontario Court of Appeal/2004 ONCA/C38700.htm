<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant's 
  rights under s. 8 of the Charter were not violated when the police officer opened 
  the door to the car. It may be that the trial judge was in error in relying 
  on the provisions of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, to find a 
  power to search the vehicle. His reliance on the common law power under R. v. 
  Waterfield, [1963] 3 All E.R. 659 (C.C.A.) was also somewhat problematic in 
  this case, although in some circumstances application of the Waterfield test 
  could provide lawful grounds for the type of search undertaken in this case. 
  </p>
<p>
  [2] However, even if there was a breach of s. 8 of the Charter, like the trial 
  judge we would not exclude the evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter. The breach, 
  if any, in this case is very narrow and consists of opening an unlocked door 
  to a vehicle parked in a residential area with its engine running. At the time, 
  the appellant was behind the wheel and apparently asleep. Once the door was 
  opened, the officer clearly had grounds to proceed further, because of the smell 
  of alcohol, and require the appellant to leave the vehicle. At that point the 
  two handguns were discovered, one lying on the seat and the other in his jacket. 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] Counsel for the appellant fairly concedes that had the officer simply waited 
  a little longer, perhaps knocked harder or yelled, if the appellant still did 
  not respond, the officer would then have been entitled to open the door to check 
  on the safety of the appellant. Alternatively, had the appellant awoken and 
  lowered his window, at that point the officer would have smelled the alcohol, 
  had the necessary grounds to require the appellant to leave the vehicle and 
  the evidence would have been discovered. </p>
<p>
  [4] In those circumstances, admission of the evidence would not bring the administration 
  of justice into disrepute. The admission of the evidence would not affect the 
  fairness of the trial and the breach was not serious. The appellant had a diminished 
  expectation of privacy. He was in an unlocked vehicle at 8:00 a.m. in a residential 
  area. The charges were very serious and the evidence was necessary to substantiate 
  those charges. </p>
<p>
  [5] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [6] As to sentence, the appellant was in possession of two loaded semi-automatic 
  handguns, one of which had hollow-point ammunition. He had a prior record for 
  a firearms offence and an offence of violence. In our view, the sentence was 
  fit.</p>
<p>
  [7] Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
