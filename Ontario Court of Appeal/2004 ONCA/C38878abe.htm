<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appeal before this court is limited to the orders made by Low J. in 
  September 2002. </p>
<p>[2] With respect to her order striking out the appellant's pleading, Low J. 
  was acting on the order of Himel J. dated August 8, 2002 which, in turn, followed 
  upon the order of Wright J. dated March 19, 2002, which the appellant has not 
  properly appealed and with which the appellant has not complied. </p>
<p>[3] With respect to the order granting the divorce judgment and related relief, 
  there was evidence before Low J. that supported her order and we cannot find 
  that she made any palpable and overriding error in reaching the conclusions 
  that she did.</p>
<p>[4] In the disposition of this appeal, we do not find it necessary to have 
  regard to the further evidence sought to be adduced by the respondent nor the 
  responding evidence sought to be adduced by the appellant.</p>
<p>[5] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs, fixed in the sum of $3,000.00.</p>
