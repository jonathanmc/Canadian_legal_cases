<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] It is conceded that the jury was properly instructed. We are not persuaded 
  that the jury's verdict was unreasonable. Although there were inconsistencies 
  in the complainant's evidence, we do not accept that they render her evidence 
  so unreliable as to make the verdict unsafe. Rather, they are of a nature common 
  in historical sexual assaults. They were fully explored by defence counsel and 
  it was up to the jury to accept or reject the evidence. The inconsistent verdict 
  point was not pursued.</p>
<p>[2] It is conceded by the Crown that the trial judge erred in principle in 
  treating the appellant's refusal to accept responsibility, thereby necessitating 
  a trial requiring the complainant to testify, as an aggravating factor. However, 
  we cannot say that a six-month custodial sentence for this offence was unfit.</p>
<p>[3] Appeal from conviction dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence granted, but 
  the appeal is dismissed.</p>
