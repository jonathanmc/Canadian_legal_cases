<p>On appeal from the dismissal of the action of the plaintiff/appellant on February 
  11, 1999 after a trial before Pardu J., sitting with a jury.</p>
<p>AITKEN J. (ad hoc) </p>
<p>
  Nature of Proceedings</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, Karen Pietkiewicz, sued the respondents for libel based on 
  statements made by William Struk, an employee of the Sault Ste. Marie District 
  Roman Catholic Separate School Board, during an interview broadcast on television. 
  At trial, the jury found that the words complained of were defamatory of the 
  appellant and that the respondents had acted with malice toward the appellant 
  when they broadcast them. Nevertheless, the jury accepted the respondents' defence 
  that the words were true. The appellant appeals this finding.</p>
<p>
  [2] The essence of the appellant's argument is that the trial got off track, 
  the alleged defamatory statement was not accurately or fairly put to the jury, 
  and the jury's finding that the words complained of were true was based on a 
  misunderstanding or an incomplete understanding as to what those words were 
  referring. </p>
<p>
  [3] For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and order a new trial. 
  </p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [4] Karen Pietkiewicz, the appellant, participated in a television broadcast 
  on September 25, 1994 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario relating to the Sault Ste. 
  Marie District Roman Catholic Separate School Board's handling of complaints 
  about the sexual misconduct of one of its former teachers, Kenneth DeLuca. The 
  appellant was known locally as the "whistleblower", whose efforts 
  had brought DeLuca's behaviour to the attention of the police. DeLuca was eventually 
  convicted of various sexual offences, including a sexual assault against the 
  appellant herself.</p>
<p>
  [5] At the beginning of the broadcast, a journalist, Jill Armstrong, introduced 
  the issue. An excerpt from an interview between the appellant and another journalist, 
  Tori Cook, was then aired.</p>
<p>
  JILL ARMSTRONG: "A former Separate School Board employee is demanding an 
  inquiry into the Board's handling of alleged sexual assault complaints. Karen 
  Pietkiewicz says she informed Board officials about the activities of the teacher 
  in question but, as Tori Cook reports, a call for an inquiry from the Ministry 
  of Education appears to be falling on deaf ears."</p>
<p>
  TORI COOK: "Karen Pietkiewicz, a former employee of the Separate School 
  Board, has written to Education Minister Dave Cook demanding that the Ministry 
  look into the Board's handling of allegations of sexual abuse against a male 
  teacher. Pietkiewicz says she went to the Board in 1989 with at least one complaint 
  from a girl under the age of 14. Do you have proof that the Board knew ahead 
  of time that &#133;" (interrupted by Karen Pietkiewicz)</p>
<p>
  KAREN PIETKIEWICZ: "Well sure, I've got the letters and the letters went 
  back and forth between me and John DeFazio for about two years and then letters 
  to Bill Struk and the list of complaints. I had some other complaints by then 
  that had racked up and a list about doing something about these students and 
  no, it didn't get done."</p>
<p>
  TORI COOK: "Pietkiewicz says Defazio's only one of a number of school officials 
  who knew of the complaints against teacher Ken DeLuca but she says nothing was 
  done until her lawyer finally initiated a police investigation. Who else did 
  you try to get help from?"</p>
<p>
  KAREN PIETKIEWICZ: "Well, eventually I went to a lawyer in 1993 to try 
  to force the Board to give me my right to complain because I'm an upper level 
  administrative support staff and I have to go through these sequences of steps. 
  I would have to go to John DeFazio and Bill Struk and then it goes to the Board, 
  so, uh, and it wasn't happening."</p>
<p>
  TORI COOK: "A police investigation has resulted in numerous charges against 
  Ken DeLuca. More charges may be laid. Pietkiewicz says the courts will decide 
  that matter. She wants the Board's actions investigated by the Ministry."</p>
<p>TORI COOK: "At least one other female says she too was ignored by the 
  School Board when she went to them with the allegations of assault by teacher 
  Ken DeLuca. The woman, who has asked not to be identified, and Karen Pietkiewicz, 
  both claim they were threatened with lawsuits if they went ahead with their 
  allegations. The School Board declined to comment. Tori Cook, MCTV News, Sault 
  Ste. Marie."</p>
<p>[6] On September 29, 1994, the School Board served the appellant, the television 
  station, the broadcaster and the journalists with a notice under s. 5 of the 
  Libel and Slander Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L. 12, as a result of the statements 
  made during this broadcast. Negotiations between the School Board and the broadcaster 
  ensued, resulting in an interview being aired on November 2, 1994 between another 
  reporter, Derek Rogers, and William Struk, a former Director of Education of 
  the School Board. Relevant excerpts from this interview follow.</p>
<p>
  DEREK ROGERS: "&#133;Struk says, contrary to unsubstantiated allegations 
  of former School Board employee, Karen Pietkiewicz, Board officials received 
  no information from Pietkiewicz in 1989 about an alleged incident of sexual 
  misconduct by DeLuca."</p>
<p>
  WILLIAM STRUK: "We have no reports whatsoever of her making such a report 
  to us or a record of her making such a report to us and in fact, if anything 
  had occurred and she was aware of it as an employee of the Board, by Board policy, 
  and by the Act, the responsibility was hers to report it to the Children's Aid 
  Society or to the police."</p>
<p>
  DEREK ROGERS: &#133;</p>
<p>
  WILLIAM STRUK: "As far as I am concerned, and the officials of the Board 
  know, the Board investigated all allegations that came to us, supervisory officers, 
  followed through with regard to the policies, followed through with regard to 
  the procedures of the Board as the Ministry of Education, Government of Ontario 
  has throughout." </p>
<p>
  &#133;</p>
<p>
  DEREK ROGERS: "&#133;Struk adds, the Board can only deal with allegations 
  if they're reported to School Board officials." [italics added].</p>
<p>[7] On November 14, 1994, the appellant served the School Board and Mr. Struk 
  with her own notice under the Libel and Slander Act complaining of these portions 
  of the broadcast. Those portions in italics were put in quotation marks in the 
  notice and were attributed to Mr. Struk.</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  Pleadings Relating to Issue of Truth</p>
<p>
  [8] A key issue at the trial was whether the statements made by Mr. Struk during 
  the second broadcast were true and therefore immune from a charge of libel. 
  It is the trial judge's treatment of this issue in her charge that is problematic. 
  </p>
<p>
  [9] In her Statement of Claim, the appellant stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  7. The words spoken by the Defendant, Struk, were not true. The Defendant, Struk, 
  and other members of the Board were aware of the conduct of the said Kenneth 
  DeLuca for some time before the Plaintiff spoke publicly; and the Board failed 
  to take adequate action to deal with the complaints concerning the conduct of 
  the said Kenneth DeLuca. &#133;</p>
<p>
  Thus, the focus of the appellant was on the conduct of DeLuca in a general sense. 
  This tied in with the general wording of the opening proposition put to Mr. 
  Struk in his interview, prior to his making the statements complained of.</p>
<p>
  [10] Much of the respondents' Amended Statement of Defence focused on the first 
  broadcast and on the respondents' allegation that the appellant had defamed 
  them in that broadcast. The respondents went on to situate Mr. Struk's comments 
  in the second broadcast as a direct response to words spoken by or allegedly 
  adopted by the appellant in the first broadcast. More specifically, the respondents 
  claimed that Mr. Struk's comments in the second broadcast were in direct response 
  to the appellant's alleged message in the first broadcast that she had gone 
  to the Board in 1989 with at least one complaint from a girl under the age of 
  fourteen. This was a statement which had been made by a reporter, and not the 
  appellant, during the first broadcast. The respondents' position was that the 
  appellant had adopted that statement as her own. The respondents pleaded that 
  Mr. Struk's first statement in the second broadcast was true because "the 
  [respondents] had not received any report from the [appellant] concerning an 
  abuse complaint of an under 14 year old girl by DeLuca".</p>
<p>
  [11] In summary, the appellant's position at trial was that the respondents 
  could not rely on the defence of "truth" unless they could prove that 
  Board officials received no information from her in 1989 about an alleged incident 
  of sexual misconduct by DeLuca. The respondents' position at trial was that 
  all they needed to prove in order to rely on the defence of truth was that the 
  appellant had not gone to the Board in 1989 with at least one complaint from 
  a girl under the age of fourteen. Their differences related to the context in 
  which each side placed the words complained of when the question of their truthfulness 
  was being considered.</p>
<p>
  Trial </p>
<p>
  [12] The trial occurred over a period of approximately one month in January/February 
  1999. The jury found that the words complained of were defamatory of the appellant, 
  were statements of fact, and were true. The jury also answered in the affirmative 
  the question: "Did either of the Defendants, the Board or William Struk 
  act with malice when they broadcast the words complained of?" yet they 
  found the words to be true. In accordance with the jury's findings, the trial 
  judge dismissed the appellant's claim and made an order of costs in favour of 
  the respondents.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  (a) Direction Regarding "Words Complained of" and Their Truth</p>
<p>
  [13] The statement which lead to Mr. Struk's statements in the second broadcast 
  made no reference to a girl under the age of fourteen, or to a girl or a child 
  of any age. The opening proposition was that Board officials had received no 
  information from the appellant in 1989 "about an alleged incident of sexual 
  misconduct by DeLuca". When Mr. Struk stated: "We have no reports 
  whatsoever of her making such a report to us &#133;", the word "such" 
  could have been referring back to "an alleged incident of sexual misconduct 
  by DeLuca". There were no descriptive words or phrases limiting the nature 
  of the alleged incident of sexual misconduct. The reporter's opening words did 
  not narrow the incident to sexual misconduct, abuse or assault directed at a 
  girl under the age of fourteen or, for that matter, at any child or girl.</p>
<p> [14] Despite this, the focus at trial became whether the Board had received 
  a report from the appellant in 1989 about the alleged sexual abuse by DeLuca 
  of a girl under the age of fourteen. Days of testimony were spent on whether 
  the appellant knew of any sexual abuse of a girl under the age of fourteen or 
  of any sexual misconduct directed at a student under the age of sixteen, whether 
  she had reported any such alleged conduct to the Board and whether she had reported 
  any abuse of a child to the Children's Aid Society. The appellant's position 
  that the words complained of were uttered as a response to a reference to sexual 
  misconduct generally, became overshadowed by the preoccupation with the alleged 
  sexual abuse of children. Although initially the trial judge reminded counsel 
  of the actual wording of the second broadcast and of the actual words complained 
  of by the appellant,<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> during the course of 
  the trial, this message was not reinforced.</p>
<p>
  [15] On page three of her ruling on February 4, 1999, the trial judge stated: 
  "[The appellant] alleged that she had reported sexual abuse by a teacher 
  upon at least one fourteen-year-old child in 1989." No such statement by 
  the appellant was referenced in the second broadcast containing the words complained 
  of. The appellant made no such allegation in her pleadings. During the trial, 
  the appellant acknowledged that although she had heard rumours about possible 
  instances of sexual abuse by DeLuca upon students who may have been fourteen 
  or younger at the time, she had no information regarding any specific incident 
  regarding a child fourteen or younger. Thus, she acknowledged not having made 
  a report in 1989 either to Board officials or to the Children's Aid Society 
  about an alleged incident of sexual abuse by DeLuca of a child fourteen or younger. 
  What she did say during the trial was that she had told Board officials in 1989 
  of DeLuca's sexual assault on herself and of the complaints she had received 
  from the parents of two of DeLuca's students. Her evidence was that one of those 
  students was at least sixteen at the time of the complaint. The other would 
  have been fourteen or fifteen at the time of the disclosure; however, there 
  was significant evidence at trial that the nature of that family's complaint 
  was not that DeLuca had sexually abused or assaulted the child in question.</p>
<p> [16] For thirty-two of the ninety-five-page charge to the jury, the trial 
  judge reviewed the evidence which the jury might want to consider when answering 
  the question whether the statements made by Mr. Struk during the second broadcast 
  were true. In so doing, she referred at length to the absence of evidence that 
  the appellant had made a report to Board officials in 1989 regarding DeLuca's 
  sexual abuse of a child, and she passed over what evidence there was that the 
  appellant had made some kind of report to Board officials in 1989 regarding 
  sexual misconduct on DeLuca's part. The word "misconduct" was replaced from 
  time to time with more restrictive words such as "abuse", "assault", or "touching". 
  Descriptors such as "girl", "child", "child fourteen years old or younger" or 
  "fourteen year-old girl" were added to restrict the type of complainant that 
  was being referenced. The following statements by the trial judge in her charge 
  are relevant: </p>
<ul>
  <li>"For example, if you find that the Plaintiff did not report sexual abuse 
    of a child in 1989 and did have a duty to report such allegations, you may 
    find that the defence of justification or truth has been established &#133;". 
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent5">This is not an accurate statement of the question to be considered 
  by the jury.</p>
<ul>
  <li>"The Defendants submit that in 1989 Karen Pietkiewicz did not report to 
    the Board any allegation that Ken DeLuca had committed an act of sexual misconduct 
    in relation to a child 14 years old or younger, and that the statement by 
    Mr. Struk that they had no such report was a true one." </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent5">There was no corresponding summary of the appellant's position relating to 
  the truthfulness of Mr. Struk's statements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>"In fact, Ms. Pietkiewicz in her evidence said that she did not disclose 
    anything suggesting sexual misconduct to Mr. DeFazio in 1989". </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent5">When the trial judge's comments following this statement are considered, it 
  is clear that she was focusing on the sexual assault of a child or the sexual 
  touching of a student and was denying any significance to evidence that DeLuca 
  may have exhibited sexual misconduct toward a student, short of an assault, 
  or may have exhibited sexual misconduct toward the appellant herself.</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Ms. Pietkiewicz said that she called Mr. DeFazio shortly afterwards to 
    describe the assault upon her and the discussion at the meeting". </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent5">This reference to the evidence is accurate, but directly contradicts the last 
  direction given to the jury.</p>
<ul>
  <li>"The Plaintiff's position is that she was truthful when she said she reported 
    a complaint to the Board in 1989 regarding a 14 year-old girl." </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent5">In reality, the appellant's position was that in 1989 she had reported an alleged 
  incident of sexual misconduct by DeLuca to Board officials.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The trial judge then discussed the first broadcast, where a reporter had 
    referred to a fourteen year-old girl, implying that this reference was what 
    Mr. Struk was responding to during the second broadcast. This was one possible 
    finding by the jury, but not the only one. It would have had the effect of 
    unduly restricting the jury's potential factual findings relating to the issue 
    of the truthfulness of Mr. Struk's statements.</li>
  <li>"Ms. Pietkiewicz in her evidence given at trial did not say she reported 
    sexual misconduct or allegations of sexual misconduct to Mr. DeFazio". </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent5">This was an unfair characterization of the appellant's evidence at trial.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The trial judge referred to s. 68(3) of the Child and Family Services Act,<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> 
    which read at the relevant time: </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">&#133; a person who in the course of his or her professional or official duties, 
  has reasonable grounds to suspect that a child is or may be suffering or may 
  have suffered abuse shall forthwith report the suspicion and the information 
  upon which it is based to a Children's Aid Society&#133;</p>
<p class="indent5">The trial judge then went on to state: </p>
<p class="indent">"There is no dispute that, if a board employee knew that a sexual assault 
  had occurred, that he or she would have been obliged to report it to a Children's 
  Aid Society, and to this extent that is a true statement." </p>
<p class="indent5">
  This compounded the confusion. If the "sexual misconduct" referred 
  to by the appellant was toward an adult, and not a child, there was no reporting 
  requirement to the Children's Aid Society. As well, the trial judge did not 
  clarify for the jury that there was no obligation to report to the Children's 
  Aid Society any alleged sexual misconduct toward a child sixteen years of age 
  or older who was not a ward of the society. This could have been relevant for 
  the jury, depending on whether they found that the appellant had reported to 
  her supervisor in 1989 an incident of sexual misconduct by DeLuca toward someone 
  other than a child under sixteen or a ward under eighteen years of age.</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  [17] As a result of these statements by the trial judge, her charge to the jury 
  would likely have left the jurors with the impression that: (1) Mr. Struk's 
  words in the second broadcast could only have referred back to the reporter's 
  statement in the first broadcast; they could not simply have referred back to 
  the reporter's opening proposition in the second broadcast; and that (2) if 
  the jury found that the appellant had not reported to the Board in 1989 an alleged 
  incident of sexual abuse by DeLuca of a girl under the age of fourteen, Mr. 
  Struk's statements were true, and the appellant's libel action could not succeed. 
  Based on the evidence at trial, more choices should have been given to the jurors.</p>
<p>
  [18] It was up to the jury to decide to what the words "such reports" 
  were referring when uttered by Mr. Struk during the second broadcast. If the 
  jury decided that these words related to the opening comments of the reporter 
  during the second broadcast, then the jury had to decide as a matter of fact 
  whether the appellant had made any report to Board officials in 1989 of alleged 
  sexual misconduct on the part of DeLuca. There was evidence at trial which could 
  have resulted in the jury deciding that the appellant had made such a report. 
  </p>
<p> [19] Although a standard of perfection is not required of a jury charge,<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> 
  and minor errors not creating a substantial miscarriage of justice will be overlooked, 
  I reluctantly conclude that the trial judge's treatment in the jury charge of 
  the issue of the truth or falsity of Mr. Struk's statements amounted to a significant 
  error. In their factum, the respondents state: "The trial was entirely about 
  the allegation that Pietkiewicz reported a sexual assault by DeLuca of an under 
  14 year old girl to the Board, and that the Board did nothing to respond to 
  the report." I agree. Unfortunately, and with the greatest of respect to the 
  trial judge, this is not all that the trial should have been about. This focus 
  did not fairly represent the words complained of by the appellant in her notice 
  and pleadings under the Libel and Slander Act, nor did it fairly represent the 
  appellant's position at trial.</p>
<p> [20] A jury decision in a defamation case is entitled to a high level of deference. 
  Nevertheless, a jury verdict will be set aside where "the judge has misdirected 
  the jury so that a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred."<a href="#a">[4]</a><a name="4"></a> 
  The substantial wrong that occurred here is that the context in which the trial 
  judge placed the words complained of, for the purpose of the jury determining 
  their truth, unfairly portrayed the potential meaning of those words. That in 
  turn unfairly restricted the jury's assessment of whether the words complained 
  of were true.</p>
<p> [21] In essence, the jurors were not given the opportunity to perform the 
  judicial duty assigned to them. This is not one of those cases where we can 
  conclude that this error was harmless and did not cause prejudice to the appellant.<a href="#a">[5]</a><a name="5"></a> 
  There was evidence adduced at trial which, if believed by the jury, could have 
  resulted in its finding that one or more of Mr. Struk's statements made during 
  the second broadcast were false. The jury found in the appellant's favour in 
  regard to all other findings of fact required of it. Consequently, had they 
  found that any part or parts of the statements complained of were untrue, the 
  appellant would have succeeded in her action.</p>
<p>
  (b) Failure of Appellant's Counsel to Object to the Charge</p>
<p> [22] The appellant's counsel at trial was given the opportunity to comment 
  on the trial judge's charge to the jury, and he specifically approved it. The 
  respondents take the position on this appeal that, since the appellant's counsel 
  did not object at trial to the alleged misdirection or non-direction of the 
  jury by the trial judge, the appellant cannot raise those objections now.<a href="#a">[6]</a><a name="6"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [23] In Arland and Arland v. Taylor, [1955] O.R. 131 at 137 (C.A.), Laidlaw 
  J.A. stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  While the failure of counsel at trial to make an objection to a charge to the 
  jury does not in every case preclude counsel on appeal from raising the objection, 
  it should be made plain once again that the omission of counsel at trial to 
  make an objection to the charge must not be regarded lightly, but, on the contrary, 
  in such a case when counsel seeks to raise the objection as a ground of appeal, 
  a new trial cannot be granted as a matter of right, but only as a matter of 
  discretion. A new trial should not be granted unless the Court is fully satisfied 
  that it is necessary in the interests of justice.</p>
<p> [24] After reviewing earlier case law, and s. 28(1) of the Judicature Act, 
  R.S.O. 1950, c. 190,<a href="#a">[7]</a><a name="7"></a> Laidlaw J.A. went on 
  to itemize at pp. 137-140 the general propositions that apply when it is only 
  on appeal that the appellant first raises objections to a jury charge in a civil 
  case.</p>
<p class="indent"> (1) A new trial is contrary to the interest of the public and 
  should not be ordered unless the interests of justice plainly require that to 
  be done.</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) An appellant cannot ask for a new trial as a matter of 
  right on a ground of misdirection or other error in the course of the trial 
  when no objection was made in respect of the matter at trial.</p>
<p class="indent"> (3) A new trial cannot be granted because of misdirection or 
  other error in the course of the trial unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage 
  has been thereby occasioned.</p>
<p class="indent"> (4) A party should not be granted a new trial on the ground 
  of non-direction in the judge's charge to the jury where, having opportunity 
  to do so, he did not ask the judge to give the direction the omission of which 
  he complains of.<a href="#a">[8]</a><a name="8"></a> </p>
<p> [25] More recently, this court has had the occasion to revisit the general 
  propositions set down in Arland, supra. In G.K. v. D.K., [1999] O.J. No. 1953 
  at paras. 16-19 (C.A.),<a href="#a">[9]</a><a name="9"></a> Finlayson J.A. considered 
  the principles enunciated in Arland and the wording of s. 134(6) of the Courts 
  of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 43.<a href="#a">[10]</a><a name="10"></a> 
  He denied the appellant's request for a new trial based on an allegedly faulty 
  jury charge because he concluded that any misdirection or non-direction had 
  not resulted in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice sufficient to 
  warrant a new trial.</p>
<p>
  [26] In Marshall v. Watson Wyatt &amp; Co. (2002), 57 O.R. (3d) 813 (C.A.), 
  Laskin J.A. highlighted three general considerations when an appellate court 
  is asked to overturn the findings of a civil jury. First, the appellate court 
  is justified in intervening only if the jury's verdict was "plainly unreasonable". 
  Secondly, s. 134(6) of the Courts of Justice Act precludes an appellate court 
  from ordering a new trial "unless some substantial wrong or miscarriage 
  of justice has occurred". Thirdly, in regard to a party's failure to object 
  to the trial judge's charge to the jury or to some other aspect of the trial 
  proceeding, Laskin J.A. stated at para. 14: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; Although the failure to object at a civil trial is not always fatal to 
  a party's position on appeal, an appellate court is entitled to give it considerable 
  weight, indeed, ordinarily more weight than the failure to object at a criminal 
  trial. In most civil cases where a party's failure to object is in issue, the 
  appellant seeks a new trial because of the alleged error. For this reason, civil 
  cases on the failure to object have typically focused on the question of whether 
  a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.</p>
<p>[27] In Marshall, a wrongful dismissal case, the jury awarded $75,000 in punitive 
  damages against the employer/appellant. The appellant argued that the trial 
  judge's instructions on punitive damages were inadequate and that the employee/respondent 
  had no legal entitlement to punitive damages on the facts of the case. This 
  court agreed with both of these submissions. In that the court accepted that 
  the respondent was not entitled to punitive damages, it was unnecessary for 
  the court to decide whether it would have overlooked the inadequate jury instructions 
  because the appellant's counsel had not objected to them at trial. The court 
  concluded that it could not let stand an award of punitive damages to which 
  the respondent was not legally entitled.</p>
<p>
  [28] Finally, in Brochu v. Pond (2003), 62 O.R. (3d) 722 (C.A.), the unsuccessful 
  plaintiff in a personal injury case appealed to this court based in part on 
  alleged inadequacies in the trial judge's charge to the jury. Although her lawyer 
  at trial had objected to various aspects of the trial judge's charge, none of 
  the objections concerned the alleged non-directions raised on appeal. In rejecting 
  the appellant's appeal on the ground of the trial judge's alleged non-direction 
  to the jury, Cronk J.A. stated at para. 68: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A new trial in a civil case should not be ordered unless the interests of justice 
  plainly require that to be done: Arland v. Taylor, supra per Laidlaw J.A. at 
  p. 140 O.R.. While it would have been better in this case for the trial judge 
  to have expanded upon the evidence and the linkage of the evidence to the issues, 
  I am not persuaded that the charge was materially deficient. I agree with the 
  respondents' submission before this court that the charge, although not a model 
  one, "got the job done". I conclude that the non-directions urged 
  by the appellant, considered in combination and in the context of the totality 
  of the charge and recharge, do not give rise to a serious concern as to whether 
  the appellant received a fair trial. The charge, in combination with the recharge, 
  contained no error, non-direction or misdirection that would justify a new trial 
  in the interests of justice, or that occasioned a substantial wrong or miscarriage 
  of justice.</p>
<p>[29] I have already found that significant errors were made in how the trial 
  judge presented to the jury the issue of the truth or falsity of Mr. Struk's 
  statements. This meant that the charge to the jury did not fairly or adequately 
  explain the appellant's position at trial. The jury's finding regarding the 
  truth or falsity of Mr. Struk's comments was the only finding adverse to the 
  appellant; it was the finding that stood in the way of her action being successful. 
  It was a substantial wrong for her position regarding the words complained of, 
  and the evidence adduced at trial to support that position, not to have been 
  adequately explained to the jury. This is one of those rare cases where, in 
  the interests of justice, this Court must exercise its discretion and allow 
  a new trial, despite the absence of any objection to the jury charge on the 
  part of the appellant's counsel at trial.</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [30] The appellant brought a motion on appeal seeking to introduce further evidence 
  by way of affidavits and transcripts. This evidence is neither relevant nor 
  necessary for the proper determination of this appeal. As a result, the motion 
  is denied.</p>
<p>
  [31] The appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered.</p>
<p>
  [32] The appellant has submitted disbursements totaling $16,590.67 for consideration. 
  The respondents' counsel does not object to $6,586.40 of those disbursements. 
  In my view, the appellant is entitled to $8,000 in disbursements. </p>
