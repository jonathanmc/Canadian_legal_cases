<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This was a motion under rule 59.06(2) or alternatively the inherent jurisdiction 
  of the court was invoked to set aside a judgment. There is also a motion to 
  review the decision of Gillese J.A. refusing an extension of time to appeal 
  the judgment. In our view, where a judgment of the Superior Court is attacked 
  on grounds of reasonable apprehension of bias, the appropriate procedural avenue 
  is an appeal. It is common ground that in the unusual circumstances of this 
  case, we are in position to set aside the order of Gillese J.A., grant an extension 
  of time for the appeal, and entertain the appeal on the merits today. </p>
<p>[2] The test for reasonable apprehension of bias is one that is dependent for 
  its application on the factual circumstances of the particular case. Here the 
  impugned comments were made in the context of a proceeding that was no longer 
  defended, there was no contest respecting credibility and the only evidence 
  before the trial judge (not Molloy J.) was the evidence indicating that a debt 
  was owed. Prior to commencing and at the trial judge's direction defence counsel 
  was called and told that the trial would be proceeding. She advised that she 
  was under instructions not to attend and defend the matter. The appellant acknowledged 
  that she knew that the only evidence that would be presented would be the evidence 
  of the respondent. The trial judge's comments were made after he had granted 
  judgment and was dealing with the matter of costs. Costs were requested on a 
  solicitor and client scale because of the difficulty the respondent had had 
  in collecting on the debt that was the subject of the judgment. The trial judge's 
  comments were made in response to this request. While the comments were unfortunate, 
  they tended to support rather than attack the interests of the defendant. There 
  is no suggestion that the judgment would have been affected. Ultimately the 
  trial judge did not accede to the request for solicitor and client costs. The 
  test for reasonable apprehension of bias has not been met. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals.</p>
