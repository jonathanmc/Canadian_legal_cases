<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are satisfied that the trial judge's finding that the appellant understood 
  his s. 10(b) right at all material times is amply supported by the evidence. 
  In the end the end the issue was one of credibility and the trial judge rejected 
  the appellant's evidence that he did not understand. The trial judge's failure 
  to reconcile the evidence of Higgins that, at the station, the notion of &quot;free 
  lawyer&quot; had to be explained does not, in our view, undermine the trial 
  judge's findings in a fair view of the entire record.</p>
<p>[2] Given the serious nature of this assault, we are not persuaded that the 
  sentence was demonstrably unfit so as to justify the intervention of this court.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the conviction appeal is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence 
  granted but the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
