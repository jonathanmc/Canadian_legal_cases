<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We would not admit the fresh evidence tendered by the appellant. It is 
  not fresh because it could have been brought to the attention of the trial judge 
  before she rendered her decision. Further, we do not believe that it would have 
  impacted materially on the ultimate result because it is at best ambiguous. 
  Accordingly, we would also not admit the fresh evidence tendered by the respondent.</p>
<p>[2] In respect of the resulting trust/gift ground of appeal, in our view, the 
  issue is fact driven. The trial judge found as a fact that the respondent had 
  met her onus of establishing that the appellant had made an unconditional gift 
  of a one-half interest in all of the parties' joint bank accounts and investment 
  funds. The trial judge gave clear and cogent reasons for coming to that conclusion. 
  She found that the respondent's evidence on the subject was amply confirmed 
  by other credible and reliable evidence. We see no basis for interfering with 
  her finding.</p>
<p>[3] With respect to the amount of spousal support, we are satisfied that the 
  trial judge applied the correct legal principles and on the evidence before 
  her, it was open to her to fix the amount as she did given the needs and means 
  of the parties.</p>
<p>[4] The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in calculating the amounts 
  of the gift by taking a balance, from one of the U.S. bank accounts, as at a 
  date later than the date of separation. We disagree. Having found that a gift 
  was made of a one-half interest in the joint bank account, the gift continued 
  so long as the joint account existed. The trial judge took the balance as of 
  that date.</p>
<p>[5] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. Costs to the respondent on a partial 
  indemnity basis fixed at $18,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
