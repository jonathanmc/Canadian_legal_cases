<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants were self-represented at trial. They ask this court to set 
  aside the judgment following trial on the basis that the trial judgment erred 
  in:</p>
<p class="indent">(1) failing to grant them an adjournment to allow them to retain 
  legal counsel; or</p>
<p class="indent">(2) failing to impress upon them the fact that evidence offered 
  from counsel table was not admissible.</p>
<p>[2] We reject both arguments.</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The transcript shows that the appellants did not request 
  an adjournment. The trial judge cannot be faulted for failing to grant one. 
  By filing the Notice of Intention to Act in person and by the appellant Orlow's 
  request to represent the appellants, it appeared that the appellants were ready 
  and willing to proceed with the trial.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Although the second ground was not pursued in oral argument, 
  we would respond by noting that the record is replete with warnings from the 
  trial judge to the appellants of the necessity of giving evidence from the witness 
  box and that she could not accept evidence given from the counsel table.</p>
<p>[3] At the hearing of the appeal, the appellants argued that Mesbur J. erred 
  in the way in which she dealt with the parties respective obligations for one 
  group of bridal gowns. On the evidence before her, the trial judge was entitled 
  to conclude, as she did, that the appellants as purchasers were responsible 
  for the payables associated with that group of gowns.</p>
<p>[4] We would dismiss the motion to admit fresh evidence on the basis that, 
  with due diligence, the evidence could have been adduced by the appellants. 
  Once the appellants legal counsel removed himself, the appellants could have 
  sought other legal advice. Instead, they chose to go to trial self-represented. 
  Moreover, the proposed fresh evidence does not bear upon a potentially decisive 
  issue.</p>
<p>[5] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondents fixed 
  at $2500.</p>
