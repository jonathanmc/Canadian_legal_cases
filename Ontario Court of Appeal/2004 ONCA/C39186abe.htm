<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, this appeal must be allowed. The trial judge failed to consider 
  important defence evidence from the appellant's wife and did not give any reasons 
  for rejecting that evidence, if indeed he did so. We are also concerned by some 
  of the language by the trial judge when he dealt with proof beyond a reasonable 
  doubt.</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge also failed to articulate reasons for accepting the evidence 
  of the complainant beside relying upon her demeanour and overlooked some very 
  problematic aspects of the evidence, including her motive to fabricate and the 
  manner in which the complaints came forward.</p>
<p>[3] We are not however persuaded that on this record the high standard for 
  finding an unreasonable verdict has been met. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, 
  the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. </p>
<p>[4] Given the passage of time, the acquittal of the appellant on the second 
  count, the somewhat unsatisfactory nature of the Crown evidence and that the 
  appellant has served the conditional sentence, the Crown may want to consider 
  whether it is in the interests of justice to proceed with a new trial.</p>
