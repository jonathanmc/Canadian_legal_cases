<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The trial judge's task here was to find the true terms on which this advance 
  was made and then to determine the legal effect of those terms.</p>
<p>[2] He performed the first step taking into account the evidence before him 
  including the promissory note, particularly paragraph 3, and the marriage contract. 
  He concluded that the money was advanced with an obligation to repay on demand 
  in the event of separation or divorce.</p>
<p>[3] That finding is owed significant deference in this court. Indeed in our 
  view it is well justified on the evidence. The trial judge properly considered 
  all the evidence before him. He was not obliged to consider only the appellant's 
  evidence in determining what the terms were on which the advance was made.</p>
<p>[4] The legal effect of an advance on these terms is straightforward in the 
  circumstances here. The condition for repayment did not arise. It is of no moment 
  whether the transaction is labelled a conditional gift or a loan repayable in 
  a circumstance which did not occur.</p>
<p>[5] In summary the reasons of Paisley J. are comprehensive, lucid and legally 
  sound. The result he reached is entirely just.</p>
<p>[6] The appeal is dismissed with costs on a partial indemnity basis fixed at 
  $10,100.27 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
