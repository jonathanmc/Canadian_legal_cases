<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] It is true that the trial judge did not specifically mention s. 718.2(e) 
  of the Code. However, it is clear from the submissions at the sentencing hearing 
  and the reasons for judgment that the trial judge was very aware of, and took 
  into account, the aboriginal status of the accused.</p>
<p>[2] The blended sentence imposed by the trial judge was entirely fit. This 
  was a serious crime, terrifying for the victim who suffered serious physical 
  and psychological injuries.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appellant's aboriginal status should not result in a sentence 
  much different from that of a non?aboriginal offender: see R. v. Wells (2000), 
  141 C.C.C. (3d) 368 at para. 42.</p>
<p>[4] Finally, we cannot say that the trial judge's decision to impose a custodial 
  sentence for the robbery offence constituted an error. The trial judge was alive 
  to both deterrence and rehabilitation and took them both into account in imposing 
  the sentence. He did not overemphasize either. </p>
<p>[5] Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal is dismissed.</p>
