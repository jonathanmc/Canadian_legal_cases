<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Assuming without deciding that the trial judge erred in holding that the 
  limitation period had expired, we would nonetheless dismiss this appeal.</p>
<p>[2] Based on the evidence before us, we see no basis for interfering with the 
  conclusion of the trial judge that the separation agreement was not unconscionable. 
  The uncontradicted financial evidence was that at the time the agreement was 
  signed and at trial, Mr. Boudreau had a monthly deficit of almost $600 because 
  he had assumed responsibility for $112,000 in joint debts. In these unusual 
  circumstances, we would not set aside this agreement. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed without costs.</p>
