<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The main issue on this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in concluding 
  that Mauro retained Rye and Partners to act for him as a solicitor. Mauro never 
  entered into a written retainer. On the issue of whether there was an oral retainer, 
  Mauro submits that the trial judge made an error when assessing his evidence. 
  The trial judge said Mauro's evidence wasn't credible because he feigned a lack 
  of interest in the work the solicitor was doing on Mauro's behalf. </p>
<p>[2] The trial judge correctly noted in his reasons that when a solicitor fails 
  to reduce to writing the terms of his or her retainer and a dispute arises, 
  there is a heavy onus on the solicitor to establish a retainer. He was satisfied 
  that that onus was met. The trial judge committed no palpable and overriding 
  error. There are a number of evidentiary factors that support his conclusion. 
</p>
<p>[3] A subsidiary issue raised for the first time on appeal is that any retainer 
  must be in writing. We do not agree with the submission that if there was an 
  oral retainer, it is void unless in writing. We are not dealing with a dispute 
  of an agreement relating to compensation under the Solicitors Act. There is 
  no dispute here as to the amount of compensation. The issue is whether the solicitor 
  was retained and she was. </p>
<p>[4] Costs to the respondent fixed as agreed in the amount of $11,000 inclusive 
  of GST and disbursements.</p>
