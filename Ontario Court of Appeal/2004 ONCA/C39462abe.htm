<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The principal ground of appeal advanced in the appeal is that the trial 
  judge failed to consider whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt 
  that the complainant did not consent and that the appellant knew she did not 
  consent.</p>
<p>[2] Consent and mistaken belief in consent were not raised at trial and there 
  was no air of reality to those issues. The complainant was intoxicated and said 
  &quot;no&quot; repeatedly. She was in no state to offer any physical resistance 
  because of the alcohol supplied by the appellant. The appellant did not testify 
  and in his statement did not allege consent.</p>
<p>[3] We see no merit to the other grounds of appeal. The trial judge fully and 
  fairly analyzed the evidence and did not misapprehend any of the material evidence.</p>
<p>[4] As for sentence, on the findings of fact by the trial judge, the sentence 
  of 40 months imprisonment in addition to credit for 16 months pre-sentence custody 
  was within the range.</p>
<p>[5] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed. While leave to appeal 
  sentence is granted, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
