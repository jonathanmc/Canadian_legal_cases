<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, there was a clear basis in the evidence to make the findings 
  of fact that constituted employee misconduct (see paras. 35-45 of Charbonneau 
  J.'s reasons for judgment), and we can find no palpable and overriding error 
  on the basis of which those findings should be disturbed. Highlighted among 
  those findings are the appellant's deception of his supervisor, the effect of 
  which deprived the employer of significant sums of money it was entitled to 
  receive, and his use of the respondent's equipment, space and time to pursue 
  his own business opportunities.</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge's determination that these rise to the level of cause for 
  dismissal is due considerable deference in this court because the damage done 
  to the employment relationship by this conduct was being evaluated in the context 
  of the trial. The trial judge made no error in the principles of law that he 
  applied, and his conclusion represents a finding of mixed fact and law in which 
  the facts are of paramount importance.</p>
<p>[3] In these circumstances, we need not deal with the question of mitigation.</p>
<p>[4] The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $12,500.00, inclusive 
  of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
