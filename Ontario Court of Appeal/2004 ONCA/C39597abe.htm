<p>[1] In our view it is not necessary to deal with whether the trial judge was 
  correct in the test for liability that he applied.</p>
<p>[2] This is so because the trial judge concluded that the plaintiff failed 
  to prove its damages. In our view this was a finding that was open to him on 
  the evidence, particularly that the market was so volatile that he could draw 
  no conclusion about the loss to which the plaintiff would be entitled, from 
  the actual sale price of the building some two years later. The initial onus 
  to prove damages is on the plaintiff. It failed to do so. This is not a question 
  of mitigation.</p>
<p>[3] Nor would we interfere with the trial judge's findings as to costs. Both 
  the order against the guiding mind of the plaintiff and the principal shareholder, 
  and the scale of the order were within the trial judge's discretion.</p>
<p>[4] The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs, payable on the same 
  basis as ordered by the trial judge, fixed at $9,946.02 inclusive.</p>
