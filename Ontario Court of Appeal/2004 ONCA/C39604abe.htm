<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] There are three grounds of appeal:</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The trial judge was required to determine whether the alleged 
  prior inconsistent statement was made by the complainant. The factors she considered 
  were relevant to that determination and appropriately considered by her. We 
  cannot interfere with her conclusion on this issue.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) When the reasons are read in their entirety, they satisfy 
  us that the trial judge properly applied the burden of proof as articulated 
  in R. v. W.(D.).</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The trial judge's reasons satisfy us that she did consider 
  and reject the appellant's evidence because it was entirely inconsistent on 
  the central issue with the evidence she found credible and worthy of belief 
  beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>[2] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
