<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We see no error in the trial judge's finding that the Crown disproved self-defence. 
  The trial judge's factual findings are entitled to deference and, in our view, 
  he was entitled to conclude that third element of self-defence under s. 34(2) 
  had been disproved. Without warning that he had a lethal weapon, the appellant 
  stabbed his assailant in the chest in circumstances where, on the trial judge's 
  finding, he could have extricated himself by escaping into his vehicle.</p>
<p>[2] As for the necessity defence to impaired driving, we agree with the trial 
  judge that having entered his vehicle and driven to the parking lot, it was 
  no longer necessary for him to drive.</p>
<p>[3] The Crown concedes that the sentence of one year concurrent for impaired 
  diving was excessive. We would allow the sentence appeal, but only to the extent 
  of reducing the sentence for impaired driving to four months concurrent. Given 
  the high degree of deference to be accorded the trial judge on the question 
  of conditional sentence, we see no reason to interfere with his conclusion that 
  given the serious nature of this assault, a conditional sentence was not appropriate.</p>
