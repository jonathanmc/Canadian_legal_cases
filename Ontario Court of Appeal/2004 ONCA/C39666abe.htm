<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In the exceptional circumstances of this case, we think an adjournment 
  should have been granted. Subject to the conditions that follow, we would therefore 
  allow the appeal and set aside the order dismissing the action. It is clear, 
  even from the limited record before us, that the appellant has delayed the prosecution 
  of this action for a significant period of time. We therefore order that, as 
  conditions of setting aside the order, the appellant shall set this action down 
  for trial within 30 days of this date and that the trial will proceed when called 
  on a basis peremptory to the appellant. The appellant shall also deposit the 
  sum of $5,000 as security for costs within 60 days of this date. If the appellant 
  fails to comply with any of these conditions, the appeal to this court will 
  be dismissed upon the filing of affidavit material from the respondent deposing 
  to such default.</p>
<p>[2] Costs of this appeal will be costs in the cause.</p>
