<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] It appears that the sentencing judge's references to the lack of evidence 
  of effective community supervision is not in accord with what this court stated 
  in R. v. Nault (2002) 59 O.R. (3d) 388 at para. 9 as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">In a situation where the sentencing judge is concerned about 
  the available resources, the judge should ask counsel to advise the Court of 
  the proposed supervision plan and, if necessary, provide evidence that the proposed 
  supervision will be in place. In that way, the judge can consider the submission 
  and his or her concerns in the context of a record, both counsel will have an 
  opportunity to assist the court and provide input into the record, and a court 
  on appeal of the sentence will have a record on which to base its consideration 
  of the issue.</p>
<p>[2] However, in our view the appellant was not a good candidate for a conditional 
  sentence given his serious criminal record and the other factors noted by the 
  trial judge.</p>
<p>[3] In all of the circumstances, we are of the opinion that the sentence imposed 
  was a fit one.</p>
<p>[4] Leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal as against sentence 
  is dismissed.</p>
