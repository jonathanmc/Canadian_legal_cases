<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We would dismiss the appeal against conviction. The trial judge was not 
  obliged to articulate a Vetrovec warning in his reasons, and we are not satisfied 
  that, having regard to his reasons as a whole, he did not adequately caution 
  himself with respect to the evidence given by Heron. </p>
<p>[2] Counsel for the Crown acknowledges that the sentence imposed on the appellant 
  is illegal. In order to correct that illegality, we would grant leave to appeal 
  against sentence and reduce the probation period from 2 years to one year. </p>
<p>[3] The sentence imposed on Count 3, the assault charge, is also an illegal 
  sentence. We would vary the sentence on that count to one year, concurrent to 
  the other sentences.</p>
