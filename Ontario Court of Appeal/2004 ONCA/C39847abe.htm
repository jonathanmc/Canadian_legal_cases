<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The reasons for judgment are inadequate. They do not come to grips with 
  the defence contention that the appellant was an unwilling dupe of his mother. 
  There was evidence to support that contention.</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge referred only to the change in the weight and appearance 
  of the suitcase in concluding that the appellant knew that there was cocaine 
  in the suitcase. The customs official did not notice anything suspicious in 
  the suitcase until she took a very close examination. The weight increased by 
  some two pounds.</p>
<p>[3] The reasons also suggest a reversal of onus. The trial judge said that 
  it is &quot;&#133;not untoward that you knew&quot; - &quot;Untoward&quot; suggests 
  something fall short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The appeal must be 
  allowed.</p>
<p>[4] The verdict is not unreasonable. A trier of fact could reasonably have 
  concluded that the appellant knew there was cocaine in the suitcase.</p>
<p>[5] The appeal is allowed. The conviction is quashed and a new trial is ordered.</p>
