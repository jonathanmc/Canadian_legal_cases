<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We see no basis for interfering with the order of the motions judge.</p>
<p>[2] To the extent that the counterclaim alleges an independent actionable wrong 
  as the basis for punitive damages, it is a claim for defamation or at least 
  a defamation-like claim. The law is well-established that a counterclaim based 
  on such allegations in a statement of claim cannot stand because the allegations 
  are absolutely privileged. This principle is not confined strictly to allegations 
  of defamation: see Dooley v. C.N. Weber Ltd. (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 779 (Gen. 
  Div.), at pp. 7-8; aff'd [1995] O.J. 940 (C.A.). Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co., 
  [2002] S.C.J. 19 (S.C.C.) does not alter this law.</p>
<p>[3] As to costs, there was a basis on the record before him to justify the 
  motion judge's exercise of discretion and there is no basis for interfering 
  with his disposition in this regard.</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>[5] Costs, payable to the respondent, are fixed at $5,000 all inclusive.</p>
