<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] R. v. Handy makes clear that the general policy presumption of the law 
  is that similar fact evidence ought, in general, to form no part of the case 
  which the accused is called on to answer.</p>
<p>[2] Against this backdrop the trial judge delivered detailed reasons for excluding 
  the two episodes tendered by the Crown. She carefully weighed the probative 
  value of this evidence against its prejudicial effect. She did not require that 
  the probative value rise to the level required in an identity case.</p>
<p>[3] As R. v. Harvey makes clear, her assessment of the degree of probative 
  effect and her balancing of that against prejudicial effect are entitled to 
  great deference. In our view her assessment is not unreasonable.</p>
<p>[4] The appeal must be dismissed.</p>
