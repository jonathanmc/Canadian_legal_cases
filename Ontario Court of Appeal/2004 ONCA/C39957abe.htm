<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals against virtually all aspects of the trial judge's 
  judgment. He submits that the trial judge made various errors of law, erred 
  in the exercise of her discretion and misapprehended the evidence. The appellant 
  has not provided a transcript of the trial and makes his argument largely on 
  the basis of excerpts from various exhibits.</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge made findings of fact, which on this record, support her 
  legal conclusions; for example, imputing income to the appellant and finding 
  that this was a traditional marriage. There was therefore a basis for the orders 
  of child support and spousal support. Also given the findings of fact, we cannot 
  say that the trial judge erred in the way that she dealt with the equalization 
  payment and the transfer of the RRSP's.</p>
<p>[3] With respect to costs, the trial judge gave reasons for the order she made. 
  This court will interfere if there has been an error in principle. We do not 
  see any such error.</p>
<p>[4] In his factum, the appellant also challenged the custody order. On this 
  record, the only appropriate order was the one made by the trial judge.</p>
<p>[5] The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs fixed at $3,000 plus disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
