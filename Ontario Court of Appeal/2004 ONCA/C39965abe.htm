<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The bail review judge did not find a Charter breach and while the conduct 
  of the Crown and the police may have been sloppy, it did not reach a level that 
  would warrant the imposition of costs against the Crown. The respondent suffered 
  no prejudice whatsoever; the matter was stood down to give him and his counsel 
  disclosure; an adjournment was offered and refused. We note as well that despite 
  comments from the bail review judge and counsel for the respondent that the 
  review hearing was a waste of time because the Crown had failed to provide any 
  &quot;new material evidence&quot;, we would simply point out that there was 
  no requirement on the Crown to adduce new evidence in order to have the release 
  order reviewed.</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the costs order is set aside.</p>
<p>&quot;K.M. Weiler J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;M. J. Moldaver J.A.&quot;</p>
<p>[3] I dissent. </p>
<p>[4] In my view the conduct of the police officer in this case went beyond mere 
  sloppiness. The main purpose, if not the whole purpose, of the bail review was 
  to tender new evidence which was contained in the victim's statement. The police 
  officer did not bring the statement to court at the time of the bail review. 
  I believe the bail review judge was entitled to make the costs order on the 
  record before him. I would not interfere.</p>
