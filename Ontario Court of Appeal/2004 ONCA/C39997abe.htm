<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant exercised its rights to have the action tried by a jury. 
  No objection was taken at trial by the appellant to the charge to the jury. 
  As the trial judge noted, credibility was a central issue in this case. The 
  jury verdict must be treated with considerable respect and must be accorded 
  great weight. We are not persuaded that there is any basis upon which to interfere 
  with this verdict. </p>
<p>[2] The respondent is entitled to her costs of the appeal fixed in the amount 
  of $20,000, inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services Tax.</p>
