<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the appeal against conviction must be dismissed with respect 
  to Counts 1 and 2 and with respect to the appellant's conviction on the charge 
  of possession of cocaine. There was ample evidence to support the trial judge's 
  finding of wilful blindness concerning Counts 1 and 2 and her inference that 
  the appellant, in fact, was in possession of the cocaine.</p>
<p>[2] In contrast, we are not persuaded that there was an adequate evidentiary 
  foundation to support the appellant's conviction on Count 3 (re the home theatre/DVD 
  equipment). As the Crown candidly concedes, the evidence in support of Count 
  3 was weak at best. It was insufficient to ground a conviction based on wilful 
  blindness or recent possession of stolen property. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the conviction appeal is allowed in part and the appellant's 
  conviction on Count 3 is set aside, together with the associated sentence of 
  12 months imprisonment.</p>
<p>[4] We are satisfied that the forfeiture order was properly made, in the alternative, 
  under s. 490.1(2) of the Criminal Code. Accordingly, while we grant leave to 
  appeal sentence, the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
