<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree with Weekes J. that the information to obtain was sufficient. 
  The information disclosed that an anonymous informant had seen this vehicle 
  being driven erratically. Five minutes later, the appellant's vehicle was involved 
  in an unexplained single car accident. The information disclosed that the appellant 
  had consumed a large quantity of alcohol 1.5 hours before the accident. There 
  was also some evidence of a smell of alcohol on the appellant. Given the totality 
  of circumstances the justice of the peace could have issued the warrant. Therefore, 
  Weekes J. was correct in allowing the Crown appeal and ordering a new trial.</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
