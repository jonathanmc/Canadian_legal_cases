<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree with Farley J.'s interpretation of the contractual documents that, 
  in relation to the appellants' territory, FCH agreed only not to grant anyone 
  else a franchise to operate a First Choice Haircutters shop, and that the contractual 
  language cannot be taken further, as the appellants would have it, to provide 
  them with wider protection against competition. Assuming that a &quot;franchisor 
  associate&quot; could be subject to the duty of fair dealing referred to in 
  the Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000, we also agree with Farley 
  J.'s interpretation of the term &quot;franchisor associate&quot; and his conclusion 
  that the Act did not apply to the present case. At paragraphs 12 and 13 of his 
  reasons, Farley J. noted some of the risks to the appellants inherent in the 
  acquisition of FCH by Regis, which operates a number of competing franchise 
  operations. We agree that, on the basis of the record, Farley J. properly refused 
  to grant any relief in response to the appellants' allegation of bad faith and 
  to its claim that the corporate veil be pierced. If the appellants seek a full 
  and proper determination of those issues, they can do so only on the basis of 
  a full factual record establishing tangible harm.</p>
<p>[2] The appeal is dismissed with costs, fixed in the sum of $10,000 plus disbursements 
  and G.S.T.</p>
