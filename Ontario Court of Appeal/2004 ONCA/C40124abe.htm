<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The motions judge gave careful and considered reasons. We agree with her 
  analysis and conclusion on the summary judgment motion. As for the stay, while 
  we are inclined to think, that the motions judge had jurisdiction under s. 106 
  of the Courts of Justice Act, it is clear that she engaged in an appropriate 
  analysis, including a weighing and balancing of the relevant factors. In the 
  end, she exercised her discretion against a stay. We see no basis for interfering 
  with her decision.</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. </p>
<p>[3] Leave to appeal the costs order made by the motions judge is dismissed. 
  Read fairly and as a whole, we are not persuaded that there is any error in 
  the cost award that justifies leave being granted.</p>
<p>[4] Costs of the appeal to the respondent on a partial indemnity basis fixed 
  at $10,000 inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
<p>Signed: &quot;M.J. Moldaver J.A.&quot;</p>
