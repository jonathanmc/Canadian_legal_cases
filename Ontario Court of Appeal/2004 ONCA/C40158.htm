<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We would allow the appeal against conviction. In our view, the trial judge 
  failed to adequately assess several features of the complainant's evidence, 
  which put her credibility into question.</p>
<p>[2] During the course of his reasons, the trial judge said:</p>
<p class="indent">The third thing on which Arjuna Kistnasami was able to testify 
  and this has troubled me -- is the fact that if there was crying, if there was 
  noise from the basement, given the fact that this was a small home, it could 
  be heard upstairs. I never heard the complainant to say she screamed, or that 
  she cried particularly loudly, or that she called out for assistance. So I'm 
  not quite sure, even though I acknowledge the point, that that particularly 
  assists me in the decision I have to make.</p>
<p>[3] The trial judge misapprehended the complainant's evidence. In fact, she 
  testified in chief that she was "yelling" and that her "tone 
  of voice was really high". On the trial judge's own analysis of the case, 
  this was a significant misapprehension of the evidence, which in and of itself 
  requires reversal. In addition, he failed to adequately address her prior inconsistent 
  statement made under oath to the police, in which she had denied any sexual 
  activity on the night in question. In our view, this inconsistency was so potentially 
  significant that it could not be excused by the complainant's assertion that 
  she was embarrassed.</p>
<p>[4] The appeal is allowed and the appellant's conviction is set aside. Although 
  this was a close case, we cannot say that the verdict was unreasonable. Consequently, 
  the Crown is entitled to a new trial if, in the exercise of its discretion, 
  it concludes that a new trial is appropriate. In this connection, we note that 
  the appellant has already served the custodial portion of his sentence.</p>
