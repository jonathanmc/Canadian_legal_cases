<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] On behalf of Triple Holdings and Triple Pizza, Mr. Chidley-Hill's primary 
  submission on appeal was that Justice Speigel erred in failing to order a trial 
  of three central and disputed issues of fact, i.e. whether the three corporate 
  entities were essentially one, whether the disclosure document was provided 
  to the respondents and whether the respondents damaged the premises and/or damaged 
  or stole equipment from the premises. This was at best an almost invisible issue 
  before Speigel J. and in our view, based on the record before her, it was open 
  to her to decide the matter on the merits.</p>
<p>[2] Both appellants argue that Speigel J. erred in concluding that the three 
  corporate appellants were essentially a single entity. We disagree. In our view, 
  based on the direct and circumstantial evidence and the lack of evidence from 
  the appellants, her conclusion is amply supported. We also find that her conclusion 
  regarding the failure of the appellants to provide the respondents with the 
  required disclosure document and her further finding that the respondents did 
  not damage the property or illegally remove items from it are also amply supported.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondents on a 
  partial indemnity basis fixed at $4,706.48 inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements. 
  In the circumstances, we make no order as to costs with respect to the motion 
  for security for costs brought unsuccessfully by the respondents.</p>
