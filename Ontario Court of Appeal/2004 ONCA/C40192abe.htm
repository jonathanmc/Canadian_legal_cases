<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant concedes that for the purposes of s. 178(1)(d) of the Bankruptcy 
  and Insolvency Act that the appellant DeMarco was acting in a fiduciary capacity. 
  He agrees that his failure to account for the trust money in issue was due to 
  his incompetence and negligence and not any wrongdoing or misconduct within 
  the meaning of s. 178(1)(d). We disagree.</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge found as a fact that the appellant had failed to adequately 
  discharge his onus as a trustee to account for the relevant trust funds. That 
  finding, which is supported by the evidence, is sufficient to trigger s. 178(1)(d). 
  (See Simone v. Daley (1999) 43 O.R. (3rd) 511 at 529.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of 
  $6,115.69.</p>
