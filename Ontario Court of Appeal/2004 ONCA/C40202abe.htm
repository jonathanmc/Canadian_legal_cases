<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The first three grounds of this appeal are fact driven in that the appellant 
  attempts to disturb findings of fact made by the trial judge.</p>
<p>[2] While there may have been some evidence upon which it would have been open 
  to the trial judge to make different findings, the appellant must show the trial 
  judge made palpable and overriding error in order for this court to interfere 
  with his findings.</p>
<p>[3] In our view, the findings of fact made by the trial judge in this case 
  were amply supported by the evidence before him and we see no palpable and overriding 
  error.</p>
<p>[4] In view of this conclusion, it is not necessary to deal with the appellant's 
  submissions in relation to damages.</p>
<p>[5] The respondent is not seeking costs in this case.</p>
