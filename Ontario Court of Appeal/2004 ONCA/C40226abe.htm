<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We see no basis upon which to interfere with the finding that the fair 
  market value of the collateral was less than the debt owed to Covington. The 
  evidence of the Receiver's efforts to sell the asset supported the respondent's 
  position. The appellant offered no evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>[2] Counsel for the appellant acknowledges that we need not address the &quot;improper 
  motive&quot; ground of appeal having rejected his first argument.</p>
<p>[3] We would not interfere with the wording of paragraphs 2 of the order.</p>
<p>[4] The appellant's submissions address the propriety of the order as it relates 
  to the Bank of Montreal. The Bank is not a party to this appeal. Any complaint 
  the appellant might have with the Bank (and we do not intend any comments on 
  the merits of any such complaint) is not part of this litigation.</p>
<p>[5] Appeal dismissed.</p>
<p>[6] Costs to the respondent on a partial indemnity basis fixed at $10,000, 
  all inclusive.</p>
