<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant challenges the jury's finding of negligence. He acknowledges 
  that if the finding is not unreasonable on the entirety of the evidence, we 
  cannot interfere. He does not challenge the apportionment of liability assuming 
  the appellant was properly found negligent.</p>
<p>[2] We cannot agree that the jury's answer to question 2 conflicts with s. 
  50 of the Public Lands Act. The jury's finding refers to a failure &quot;to 
  act on or investigate concerns brought up in safety meetings regarding the corner&quot; 
  [the location of the accident]. Section 50 precludes civil suits for negligence 
  in relation to the maintenance or repair of the road. The jury was properly 
  instructed on s. 50 and, in our view, their finding refers to the appellant's 
  failure to take any steps to bring the concerns to the attention of the owner 
  of the road and/or to its failure to take appropriate steps in its own operations 
  to address the risk prescribed by the curve.</p>
<p>[3] The fact that s. 50 may shelter the owner from civil liability in some 
  circumstances does not mean that the owner would have ignored any safety concerns 
  that the appellant might have brought to the owner's attention. Consequently, 
  it cannot be said that there is no causal link between the jury's finding of 
  negligence and the damages suffered by the deceased. We are satisfied that the 
  statement of claim is broad enough to encompass the basis of liability found 
  by the jury.</p>
<p>[4] We cannot agree that the minimal apportionment of liability as against 
  the driver demonstrates that the finding of liability against the appellant 
  was unreasonable. The findings are predicated on different considerations and 
  one does not inform the other.</p>
<p>[5] Costs to the respondent for the appeal and a related motion in the amount 
  of $19,300.</p>
