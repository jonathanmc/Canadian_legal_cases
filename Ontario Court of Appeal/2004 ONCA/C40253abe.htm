<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree with the trial judge and Rutherford J. They applied the decision 
  of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Toews (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 24 and 
  Rutherford J. also applied this court's decision in R. v. Pelletier (2000), 
  6 M.V.R. (4th) 152 in finding that on the facts the appellant was in care and 
  control. There was evidence of some course of conduct associated with the vehicle. 
  On that issue, the judge was entitled to take into account all of the relevant 
  surrounding circumstances, including the appellant's stated intention to resume 
  driving. His assertion that he intended only to drive when he felt he was sober 
  went only to weight. As to the other elements, risk and dangerousness, there 
  was abundant evidence including that the appellant was heavily intoxicated, 
  the keys were in the ignition, the car was running and the appellant had made 
  no arrangements to have someone else drive.</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>Signed: &quot;M. Rosenberg J.A.&quot;</p>
