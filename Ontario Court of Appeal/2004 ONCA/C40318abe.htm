<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] There is no ambiguity in the sentence imposed. The appellant received a 
  total sentence of two years and three months. In imposing that sentence, the 
  trial judge took into consideration the pre-trial custody.</p>
<p>[2] There is no merit to the contention that the appellant's sentence is improperly 
  disparate when compared to the co-accused. The appellant was convicted of a 
  whole series of offences that did not involve the co-accused. These were serious, 
  including breach of court orders and were committed while the appellant was 
  on bail on the first set of charges.</p>
<p>[3] Leave to appeal granted, but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
