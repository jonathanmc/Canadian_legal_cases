<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal from judgment dismissing the appellant's
  claim on a motion brought by the respondent for summary judgment. </p>
<p>[2] The allegations in the statement of claim arise
  out of the eviction of the plaintiff from her home by the sheriff. Employees
  of the respondent were called by the sheriff to assist in gaining entry and
  removing the plaintiff. The sheriff was acting under a court order. On the
  uncontested evidence the police acted under lawful authority. There is no evidence
  to support the allegation of theft. The action was properly dismissed. The
  appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent in the amount of $500.00. </p>
