<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Counsel for the appellants abandoned the arguments on the 80/20 split and 
  on costs. He raised three issues:</p>
<p>1. Med-Chem. We did not call on counsel for the respondents on this issue because 
  this was the product of a finding of fact by the deputy registrar, confirmed 
  by Ground J., that the allocation of the monthly fee applied only during the 
  1995/1996 year. There was evidence to support this finding and no basis for 
  this court to intervene.</p>
<p>2. Allocation of OHIP billings to expenses. In our view, it was open to the 
  deputy registrar to conclude, as Ground J. confirmed, that paras. 1(b) and (d) 
  of the clarification order authorized the finding he made which, again, was 
  supported by the evidence.</p>
<p>3. Bank loans. The evidence reflected that, at the time the appellant took 
  the proceeds of the bank loans, she was indebted to the clinic in a larger amount 
  and it was open to the deputy registrar to find, as he did, and as Ground J. 
  confirmed, that she was obliged to account for those moneys, together with interest.</p>
<p>[2] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed in the sum 
  of $7,500, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
