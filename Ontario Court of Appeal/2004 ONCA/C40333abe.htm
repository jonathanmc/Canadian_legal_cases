<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] There was a joint submission for three years. The appellant has a terrible 
  record mainly for property related offences. He pled guilty to a number of property 
  related offences. He is however, a young man who has never been sentenced to 
  more than six months in jail before. He is working to overcome a serious addiction.</p>
<p>[2] We think the proposed sentence was within the appropriate range in all 
  of the circumstances. Consequently, the trial judge erred in &quot;jumping&quot; 
  the joint submission and imposing a sentence of five years. To give effect to 
  the joint submission, we would impose a total sentence of three years. We would 
  grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal and vary the sentence by making 
  the one-year sentence imposed on the break-in at Pembleton residence, and the 
  one-year sentence imposed in the break-in at the residence at 216 Ivon Ave. 
  concurrent to the sentences imposed in the remaining break and enter resulting 
  in a total sentence of three years.</p>
<p>[3] We would not interfere with the restitution order.</p>
