<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree with the reasons of Power J. that Economical and Lloyd's have 
  a duty to contribute to the defence cost funding of the Defendant Lyle Ross. 
  There is no dispute that the fire occurred in 1997, when the policies had expired. 
  The statement of claim determines whether a duty to defend arises. It explicitly 
  alleges that the damage by pyrolisis commenced when the fireplace was first 
  used in 1988 and continued until the actual combustion in 1997. Both policies 
  limit coverage to &quot;property damages&#133;which occurs during the policy 
  period.&quot; </p>
<p>[2] As the motions judge concluded, there is a possibility that, after the 
  relevant evidence is heard, coverage under the insurance policies might apply 
  based in particular on Alie v. Bertrand &amp; Freres Construction Company Limited, 
  [2002] 62 O.R. (3d) 345 (Ont. C.A.). In Alie, the court held that consequential 
  losses which manifest themselves after the policy has expired, may nonetheless 
  be covered by the policy if the damage occurred during the period of coverage.</p>
<p>[3] There are 2 remaining issues. Lloyd's argued that the pleadings were manipulated 
  to trigger a duty to defend. On the record before us, there is no basis for 
  this conclusion. Secondly, the appellants in their factums had requested this 
  court to provi</p>
<p>de guidance on the apportionment of the defence costs contributions between 
  them. In oral argument, the parties accepted the motions judge's direction that 
  they seek further direction from him on this issue.[4] The appeals are dismissed, 
  with costs on consent, payable by Economical and Lloyd's to Lyle Ross in the 
  amount of $3,500 and to the Plaintiffs in the same amount.</p>
