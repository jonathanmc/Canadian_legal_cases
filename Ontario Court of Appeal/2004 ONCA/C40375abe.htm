<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The sentence was undoubtedly at the bottom end of the range. However, the 
  trial judge, who had the advantage of seeing the respondent, had valid reasons 
  why he imposed such a low sentence. But even assuming that the sentence was 
  unfit when imposed, we do not consider that it is in the interests of justice 
  to now re-incarcerate the respondent. </p>
<p>[2] In so holding, we take into account the very positive post-sentence report, 
  the respondent's youthfulness and the importance of rehabilitation. Accordingly, 
  though leave to appeal sentence is granted, the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
