<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Mr. Swartz appeals from the decision of Swinton J. granting partial summary 
  judgment and dismissing his claims in the amended statement of defence and counterclaim 
  for (a) a complete accounting of partnership profits from 1990 to 2000, (b) 
  an equitable distribution of partnership payments for the same years and (c) 
  his claim for general damages for mental distress, loss of law career, intentional 
  infliction of mental and emotional suffering, breach of contract, breach of 
  fiduciary duty and undue influence as against his former partners, Schneider 
  and Ruggierio. The latter claim was permitted to proceed against the former 
  partner, Lewis Baker, whose alleged overbearing and abusive conduct towards 
  Mr. Swartz is at the core of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>[2] With the exception of the claim for an accounting for the period January 
  2000 to July 2001, when Mr. Swartz left the firm, we find no error on the part 
  of the motions judge and would dismiss the appeal for the reasons she gave.</p>
<p>[3] On his evidence, however, Mr. Swartz has received no accounting or distribution 
  for the period of time during 2000 when he remained a partner - that period 
  of time is itself an issue to be determined by the trial judge - and for the 
  period of time prior to his departure during which he may be entitled to payment 
  according to the agreement of December 22, 2000 (A.B. Vol. 3, Tab 18). In our 
  view, he is entitled to pursue that aspect of his claim for an accounting. The 
  appeal is therefore allowed to that extent, but is otherwise dismissed.</p>
<p>[4] There is a cross-appeal against the decision of the motions judge to permit 
  the claim to proceed against Mr. Baker. The record justifies a trial on that 
  claim and we see no merit in the cross- appeal. It is therefore dismissed.</p>
<p>[5] The respondents are entitled to their costs of the appeal, fixed at $4000, 
  all inclusive.</p>
