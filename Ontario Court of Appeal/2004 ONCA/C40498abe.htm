<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We see no error of law that would justify the interference of this court. 
  We agree with the detailed and careful reasons of the summary conviction appeal 
  judge that the trial judge did not err in law in convicting the appellant of 
  mischief.</p>
<p>[2] We do not accept the appellant's characterization of this case as involving 
  the fundamental right of every citizen to communicate with elected officials. 
  This right is central to democracy and is acknowledged by the respondent. The 
  appellant had the right to communicate with his MPP. However, he crossed the 
  line when he did what the trial judge found he did, namely, wilfully interfere 
  with the lawful use and operation of his MPP's fax machine and thereby interfere 
  with the right of other citizens to communicate with their MPP. The trial judge 
  found that the appellant acted out of anger and frustration, not out of a desire 
  to communicate. There was evidence to support that finding.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted, but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
