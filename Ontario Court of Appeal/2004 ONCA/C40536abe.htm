<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant bases his first argument on the testimony of Dr. Ellis, saying 
  that Dr. Ellis has considerable doubt as to whether Mr. Boismier is suffering 
  from a major mental illness. However, while Dr. Ellis did express some reservation 
  with respect to Mr. Boismier's diagnosis, he affirmed that he did not dispute 
  the diagnosis and that the diagnosis was consistent with the information available 
  to him. He was clearly of the opinion that a discharge was not an appropriate 
  disposition in light of the risk of harm presented by Mr. Boismier.</p>
<p>[2] In light of these considerations, we are of the view that the Board's decision 
  is reasonable and supported by the evidence in the record. The decision reflects 
  a consideration of all necessary and relevant evidence and information. In coming 
  to this conclusion, we note that it might have been advisable for the Board 
  to have determined the status of the lawsuit that is Mr. Boismier's focus. However, 
  on the evidence in this case, that information would not have affected the disposition.</p>
<p>[3] The Board made no error in law or principle and the disposition is the 
  least onerous and restrictive. As a consequence, we see no basis upon which 
  to interfere with the Board's decision. The appeal is dismissed.</p>
