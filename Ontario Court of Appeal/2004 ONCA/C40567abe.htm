<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals the order of Snowie J. finding her in contempt of 
  three court orders regarding access by the husband to the infant child. We would 
  allow the appeal. In our view, where the record contains significant conflicting 
  evidence and when in the four weeks before the hearing access had been properly 
  provided, no finding of contempt could be made beyond a reasonable doubt without 
  the trial of an issue, after taking into account the purging of the alleged 
  contempt by the recent compliance.</p>
<p>[2] We note that the trial of the custody and access matters are to be heard 
  in the week of April 19, 2004. Although counsel may proceed with this contempt 
  matter at that time, they may feel it is more appropriate to focus on the custody 
  and access issues.</p>
<p>[3] No costs.</p>
