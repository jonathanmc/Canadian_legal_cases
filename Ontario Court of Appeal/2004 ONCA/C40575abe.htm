<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the trial judge erred in finding there was no s. 8 violation. 
  The validity of the search depended on consent. As the appellant was detained, 
  he should have been given his s. 10(b) rights and given a reasonable opportunity 
  to consult counsel before consenting. However, we are satisfied that the evidence 
  should not be excluded under s. 24(2). We agree with the reasons of the trial 
  judge at pp. 22 and 23 of his ruling in that respect.</p>
<p>[2] As to the reasonableness of the verdict, even without the statements by 
  the appellant in the cruiser, there was an overwhelming case of possession for 
  the purpose of trafficking. The appellant was the driver of the vehicle and 
  there were indicia that he and his companion were drug couriers.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
