<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the motions judge's finding that counsel and the parties always 
  understood that the husband would keep his business, the wife would keep the 
  condominium and the proceeds of sale of the former matrimonial home would be 
  equally divided between the parties in satisfaction of their respective property 
  entitlements, including the husband's entitlement to an equalization payment, 
  is not supported by the evidence. Indeed, the evidence of the wife's former 
  solicitor, who represented her throughout the settlement discussions, is to 
  the contrary. </p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the motions judge's judgment cannot stand. The parties have 
  been unable to agree that there are any parts of the judgment that can stand. 
</p>
<p>[3] The appeal is allowed and the judgment dated August 6, 2003 is set aside 
  in its entirety, including the matter of the costs of the proceedings before 
  the motions judge. In our view, the parties should bear their own costs of the 
  motions below and of this appeal.</p>
