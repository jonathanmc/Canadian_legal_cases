<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The trial judge based his decision on business records that were admitted 
  without objection by the defendants. He properly found that the evidence established 
  the existence of a contract, a breach of that contract, and damages.</p>
<p>[2] We consider the trial judge's reasons for granting judgment against Barone 
  Monti Trading a permissible application of Rule 25.07. In their pleadings, the 
  defendants made no distinction between the two corporations, thereby implicitly 
  acknowledging the unity of their positions and liability. We note, moreover, 
  that both defendants are counterclaiming damages arising from the transaction, 
  thereby implicitly acknowledging that both companies were involved in it.</p>
<p>[3] We see no merit in the submission that the trial judge erred in refusing 
  to adjourn the trial against the defendants, in view particularly of the fact 
  that the defendants had unsuccessfully sought an adjournment two days earlier 
  before the motions judge. We do not accept that he improperly fettered his discretion 
  by considering this decision of the motions judge.</p>
<p>[4] Appeal dismissed with costs fixed in the total amount of $2,000.</p>
