<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The Crown acknowledges that the trial judge should not have relied on the 
  appellant's record for previous drug offences in concluding that he was guilty 
  of possession for the purpose of trafficking; and that there was inconsistency 
  between the trial judge's reasons for conviction and reasons for sentence on 
  the question whether the appellant was a user of crack cocaine.</p>
<p>[2] We agree. We would vacate the appellant's conviction and substitute for 
  it a conviction for simple possession. We are persuaded that an appropriate 
  sentence for the substituted conviction would be time served and the appellant's 
  sentence should be amended accordingly.</p>
<p>[3] The appeal is allowed to reflect the disposition indicated in this endorsement. 
  The order imposed under s. 109 of the Criminal Code by the trial judge in this 
  case will be vacated.</p>
