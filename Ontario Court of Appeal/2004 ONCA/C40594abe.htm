<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are of the view that the appeal cannot succeed. The letter of Dr. Shelly 
  which was written after the original decision of the Appeal Tribunal expressed 
  his opinion that it was only "possible" that the appellant's occupation 
  was an aggravating factor of her carpal tunnel disorder.</p>
<p>[2] In our opinion, the failure of the Tribunal to refer to Dr. Shelly's letter 
  in its refusal to reconsider the application of the appellant does not mean 
  that the evidence was not considered. It is agreed that the standard of the 
  review of the Tribunal's decision is patently unreasonable and we agree with 
  the decision of the Divisional Court that the Tribunal's decision could not 
  be characterized as such.</p>
<p>[3] The appeal is therefore dismissed without costs.</p>
