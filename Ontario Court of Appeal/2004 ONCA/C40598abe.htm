<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants contend that Ground J. did not properly apply the principles 
  approved of by Anderson J. in Crown Trust v. Rosenberg. We disagree. Those principles 
  were approved of by Galligan J.A. in Soundair, the case relied on by the motions 
  judge.</p>
<p>[2] Moreover, in our view the process and procedure followed by the motions 
  judge in approving the settlement were appropriate. He considered the difference 
  between the two expert reports and made express findings on those differences. 
  He made no palpable and overriding error in his findings. Bearing in mind the 
  deference accorded to a receiver's recommendation and the deference accorded 
  by this court to a motion judge's findings, we see no basis to interfere with 
  the decision approving the settlement. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>[4] Our costs orders are as follows:</p>
<p>1. KPMG shall have costs in the amount of $16,000 inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST. In fixing this amount we agree that the receiver and BDBC are entitled 
  to their costs of the motion before Cronk J.A. The money presently in court 
  for security for costs shall be paid out to the receiver's solicitor in partial 
  payment of its costs of the appeal. <br>
  2. Laurentian Bank shall have its costs of the appeal in the amount requested, 
  $4527.71, inclusive of disbursements and GST. This amount shall be payable either 
  by the appellants or out of the insurance settlement proceeds.<br>
  3. The Business Development Band of Canada shall have costs (which include the 
  costs of the motion before Cronk J.A.) in the amount of $2,500 inclusive of 
  disbursements and GST. Payment of those costs shall be a first charge on the 
  insurance settlement proceeds after the Laurentian Bank has been paid out. </p>
