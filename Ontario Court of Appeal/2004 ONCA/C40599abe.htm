<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The applicant's main contention is that the Minister's letter ordering 
  surrender does not give adequate reasons for his decision. We acknowledge that 
  the Minister's reasons are perfunctory. However, in our view, they are adequate 
  in this case. </p>
<p>[2] The Minister said that he considered the applicant's s. 6 rights and his 
  health concerns. We must assume that he did so and that he also took into account 
  his counsel's memorandum. That memorandum considers the Cotroni factors, the 
  applicant's health problems and Mr. Slansky's submission that the two are related. 
  The Cotroni factors point overwhelmingly to prosecution in the United States; 
  and from the record the applicant's health concerns taken alone or in conjunction 
  with his s. 6 rights, do not justify refusing to surrender him. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the application is dismissed.</p>
