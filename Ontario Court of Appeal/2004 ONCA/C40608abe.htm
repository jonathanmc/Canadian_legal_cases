<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The discretion to dismiss an action on the basis of abuse of process must 
  be exercised with a view to ensuring that justice is done. Larabie's Statement 
  of Claim clearly establishes the factual context of a valid claim, a claim that 
  has never been considered on a substantive basis. In responding to the motion 
  there was some medical and eye witness evidence put forward to support the claim. 
  The motions judge was of the opinion that commencing a new action against the 
  individual plaintiffs after the court had refused to amend the claim to name 
  these two persons in a prior action flew in the face of the prior decisions 
  of the court and constituted an abuse of process. In the circumstances of this 
  case, that conclusion was an error in principle. The prior decisions stemmed 
  from the dismissal of a motion to amend the statement of claim. This was a purely 
  procedural decision that expressly declined to deal with the merits of the appellant's 
  claim. Much could have been avoided had that decision been appealed because 
  thereafter the proceedings focused on subsidiary procedural issues. </p>
<p>[2] In the matter under appeal, the motion judge, in the exercise of his discretion 
  did not answer the question whether, if the claim were dismissed, it would result 
  in injustice to the appellant because he would be deprived of his day in court 
  on the merits of his claim. Instead, he appears to have been of the opinion 
  that all that would take place would be to relitigate an issue that had already 
  been decided as though the appellant had already had his day in court. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly the appeal is allowed, the decision of Forget J. is set aside 
  and the action is allowed to proceed. The costs of this appeal and of the motion 
  reserved to the panel are fixed at $6500 all in and are to be set-off against 
  the outstanding costs orders. </p>
