<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] At the outset of the appeal, the court raised the question of our jurisdiction 
  to entertain the appeal. Both counsel submitted that we had jurisdiction and 
  that we should hear the appeal on its merits. We did so.</p>
<p>[2] In our view, the appeal is wholly unmeritorious. Blair J. had the jurisdiction 
  to make the order he did under rule 49.09 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, and 
  he made no error in exercising his discretion in the manner in which he did.</p>
<p>[3] The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed in the sum of $3,500, inclusive 
  of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
