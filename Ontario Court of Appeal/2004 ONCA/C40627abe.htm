<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant submits that the verdict is unreasonable. The appellant admitted 
  his involvement in the robbery to a witness, Mr. Uhryn. Mr. Uhryn had a criminal 
  record and argued that there was bad blood between himself and the appellant. 
  However, the balance of the evidence served to confirm the appellant's admission.</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge was in the best position to assess the reliability and 
  credibility of the witnesses. In addition, the appellant called no evidence 
  to contradict or give an explanation for his admission. </p>
<p>[3] The verdict was not unreasonable. The appeal as to conviction is dismissed.</p>
