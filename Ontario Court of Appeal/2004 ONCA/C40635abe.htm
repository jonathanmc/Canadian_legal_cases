<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree with Ms. Tough that the letter of June 26, 2002 should have been 
  before the motion judge. We are satisfied, however, that the result would have 
  been the same given the history of this matter, and the absence of any material 
  from the appellant on the motion, or even now, explaining the default or complying 
  with outstanding undertakings.</p>
<p>[2] The appeal from the order striking the statement of defence is dismissed.</p>
<p>[3] The issue raised on the application was pleaded in the statement of defence 
  and given that the statement was properly struck, it would have been inappropriate 
  to proceed with the merits of the application.</p>
<p>[4] Appeal dismissed. Costs of the proceedings in this court payable to the 
  respondents and fixed at $6,000.00.</p>
<p>[5] On consent, the title of proceedings in appeal C40637 should be amended 
  to include as a respondent Michael John Halow Jr.</p>
