<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] At its highest, the evidence shows that there was an exchange of letters 
  from which the parties committed to a process. </p>
<p>[2] However, we think that it was open to the applications judge to find that 
  there was no agreement for the purchase and sale of these lands. As the applications 
  judge pointed out, there were a number of terms that had already not been agreed 
  to by the parties.</p>
<p>[3] In the circumstances, the respondent had a prime facie right to the partition 
  and sale. </p>
<p>[4] The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $5,000 
  which will become a charge on the proceeds of the sale if not paid before.</p>
