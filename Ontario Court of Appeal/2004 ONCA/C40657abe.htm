<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals his conviction for sexual assault. We interpret the 
  trial judge's use of the term corroboration as per Vetrovic and, in using the 
  term, the trial judge considered whether the evidence of AB was confirmatory 
  of NL's evidence. </p>
<p>[2] The thrust of the defence was NL's delay in disclosing the allegation of 
  sexual abuse to the police. NL and the appellant had a volatile relationship 
  with a lot of fighting and some abuse. On the night in question there was an 
  argument that went on for hours. The morning after the alleged assault AB testified 
  that NL &quot;looked different than normal&quot; and that she was &quot;very, 
  very troubled&quot;. The trial judge was entitled to take this evidence into 
  consideration in deciding whether something out of the ordinary happened on 
  the night in question. This was a straightforward case and the trial judge dealt 
  with the delay in disclosure as well as adverting to the inconsistencies in 
  the evidence in his reasons. </p>
<p>[3] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
