<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The threats in this case were especially serious. Moreover, the appellant 
  had a concealed weapon inside the correctional facility. The impact of the threat 
  on the correctional worker who received one of them was devastating. Correctional 
  workers have very difficult jobs and deserve to be protected by the courts. 
  The appellant has an incredibly serious criminal record, including for crimes 
  of violence against police officers. </p>
<p>[2] In light of all of these facts, we cannot say that the sentence imposed 
  by the trial judge was excessive.</p>
<p>[3] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
