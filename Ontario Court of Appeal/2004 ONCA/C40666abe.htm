<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Counsel are agreed that the sentencing judge and trial counsel were misinformed 
  about the sentence the respondent received for the drug offence (by four months). 
  We doubt that this would have made any difference to the sentence he imposed.</p>
<p>[2] It is clear that the trial judge anchored his sentence in a careful assessment 
  of the totality principle. That drove his decisions with respect to the consecutive 
  versus concurrent and custodial versus conditional issues. Although his finding 
  of nexus between the drug and sex offences was perhaps something of a stretch, 
  his reasons read as a whole do support the sentence he imposed. He was acutely 
  aware of the unique and difficult circumstances of this offence and, in our 
  view, imposed an appropriate sentence.</p>
<p>[3] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
