<p>[1] We agree with Hoilett J. that the CGU policy is a primary policy. We would 
  simply refine that determination by defining it, more accurately, as a primary 
  policy with an excess coverage clause. No issue is taken with the determination 
  that the second Lombard policy is a true umbrella policy. In such circumstances, 
  the law is clear that the primary policy with excess coverage ranks ahead of 
  the umbrella policy. (See Trenton Cold Storage Ltd. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine 
  Insurance Co., [2001] O.J. # 1835 Ont. C.A.)).</p>
<p>[2] We see no merit in the arguments that Lombard did not have standing to 
  bring the application or that the issues in question were not appropriately 
  dealt with by way of application.</p>
