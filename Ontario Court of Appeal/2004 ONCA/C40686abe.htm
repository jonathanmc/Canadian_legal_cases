<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] On the basis of the finding of the motion judge that the appellant would 
  not have consented to an order dismissing its action against Almerco Recherche 
  Inc. (&quot;ARI&quot;) but for the misrepresentation of Mr. Mercier, the motion 
  judge should have set aside that order. In our view, he erred in principle in 
  expanding the test for setting aside consent orders by requiring the appellant 
  to demonstrate that it had &quot;a genuine issue for trial with respect to the 
  claim against ARI&quot;, and to demonstrate that it would be prejudiced if the 
  consent order were not set aside.</p>
<p>[2] The appeal is allowed, the order of Power J. is set aside, and an order 
  substituted for the relief requested in paras. 1 and 2 of the notice of motion 
  before him. The appellant is entitled to the costs of the motion, in the amount 
  directed by Power J., and to the costs of the appeal, fixed in the amount of 
  $5,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
