<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] As we read the reasons, the application judge was not satisfied that there 
  was a material change in circumstances warranting a change in the primary residence. 
  The primary residence and joint custody had been agreed to by the parties and 
  in the view of the application judge had enured to the benefit of the child. 
  We see no basis upon which to interfere with the decision of the application 
  judge.</p>
<p>[2] The application judge observed that Isaac (the child) is doing well, is 
  happy and has bonded to both parents. The parents are to be commended for the 
  result and their mutual determination to do what is best for Isaac. As Isaac 
  gets older, school demands will increase. The application judge directed that 
  the father's parenting should be adjusted to reflect the school routine when 
  Isaac started school in September 2003. The parents have done so successfully. 
  We are confident that they can and will continue to make adjustments that will 
  promote Isaac's best interests and well being as he progresses in school. Appeal 
  is dismissed. Costs to the respondent in the amount of $4,500.</p>
