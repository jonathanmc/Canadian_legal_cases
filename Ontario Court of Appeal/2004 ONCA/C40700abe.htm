<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] On May 23, 2003, the appellant entered into several vehicles in the Orillia 
  area and removed a cell phone, money and change. At 4:00 a.m., the appellant 
  stole a van. A police pursuit followed when an O.P.P. officer attempted to pull 
  the van over. At least four police cruisers were damaged as a result of the 
  chase. Ultimately, the van came to a stop when it hit a median in a parking 
  lot, lost control and crashed into a York Regional police cruiser.</p>
<p>[2] These events occurred after the appellant was absent without leave on May 
  12, 2003, while on parole for other offences. An arrest warrant by the National 
  Parole Board had been issued against the appellant between May 12 and the date 
  of the offence. The appellant was at the time also under a driving prohibition 
  and a driver's licence suspension. The appellant's criminal record was long, 
  continuous and serious, even though he is a young man.</p>
<p>[3] In light of these factors, we cannot say that the sentence of three years 
  was unfit. The fact that the result of the conviction is that the appellant 
  will have to serve the remnant of his previous sentence is not entitled to much 
  weight: see R. v. Gorham (1987), 22 O.A.C. 237. Nor, in the awful circumstances 
  of the incident which led to these charges, can we conclude that the trial judge 
  overemphasized deterrence and denunciation.</p>
<p>[4] Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal is dismissed.</p>
