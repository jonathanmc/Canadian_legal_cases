<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant Vera Dickinson seeks to set aside the September 25, 2003 
  order of Himel J. and to obtain an Order: (i) dismissing the respondents' rule 
  21.01 motions to strike Vera Dickinson's claim on the basis that it discloses 
  no reasonable cause of action; and (ii) granting leave under rule 15.01 of the 
  Rules of Civil Procedure for Vera Dickinson to represent the appellant corporation 
  in this action.</p>
<p>[2] We conclude that this appeal must be dismissed for the following reasons.</p>
<p>[3] We agree with Vera Dickinson that the motions judge's order striking her 
  claim is a final order. Vera Dickinson, however, is a shareholder of the appellant 
  corporation that owns the property at issue. The motions judge correctly concluded, 
  therefore, that Vera Dickinson has no legal capacity to sue the respondents 
  in this action. The asserted cause of action is that of the corporation, not 
  that of Vera Dickinson.</p>
<p>[4] The motions judge's discretionary order under rule 15.01, declining to 
  grant leave to Vera Dickinson to represent the corporate appellant in this action, 
  was interlocutory in nature. Appeals from interlocutory orders lie to the Divisional 
  Court, with leave of that court. Accordingly, we have no jurisdiction to entertain 
  the appeal from the motions judge's order denying leave under rule 15.01.</p>
<p>[5] We note, concerning these matters, that the appellant corporation's action 
  remains outstanding. If Vera Dickinson is successful before the Divisional Court 
  (should leave be sought from and granted by that court to appeal to that court), 
  in obtaining an order allowing her to represent the corporate appellant, or 
  should the corporate appellant retain counsel, its action against the respondents 
  can proceed.</p>
<p>[6] This is not an appropriate case for an award of costs.</p>
