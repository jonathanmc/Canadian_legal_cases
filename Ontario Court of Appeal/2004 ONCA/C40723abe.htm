<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] While we do not agree with the motion judge that there was no basis for, 
  as he put it, "piercing the corporate veil", we are satisfied that 
  he came to the right result in finding that there was no case for equitable 
  set-off. The transaction involved here was a debt to an entirely different company 
  incurred prior to the merger with the Spill Tech entity. There was therefore 
  no basis for finding that the equitable ground went to the very root of the 
  claim. It was also not shown that the claim was so clearly connected with demand 
  of the appellant in the first action.</p>
<p>[2] As to the stay of execution, given the lack of understanding between this 
  debt and the other claim, we cannot say that the motion judge erred in refusing 
  to grant a stay of execution.</p>
<p>[3] Appeal dismissed with costs fixed at $5,000 inclusive of disbursements 
  and G.S.T.</p>
<p>Signed: "Rosenberg J.A."</p>
