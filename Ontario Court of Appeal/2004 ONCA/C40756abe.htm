<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>WEILER AND CRONK JJ.A.:</p>
<p>
  [1] In our view, the sentence appeal should be allowed. The fresh evidence, 
  filed on consent, demonstrates that the appellant has made a concerted effort 
  at rehabilitation since his release on bail in September 2003, including attending 
  various rehabilitation programs, registering for others and moving to a new 
  apartment in an area away from his previous associates. This information was 
  not available to the trial judge at the time of sentencing when she concluded 
  that the appellant's prospects for real rehabilitation were questionable. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant committed a minor theft while he was on bail and attempting 
  rehabilitation. It is common ground that he has a severe addiction problem. 
  Attempts at rehabilitation do not always go in a straight line.</p>
<p>
  [3] For these reasons, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the sentence appeal 
  is allowed and the sentence is reduced to fourteen months' incarceration, which 
  sentence the appellant has already served.</p>
<p>
  GILLESE J.A. (dissenting):</p>
<p>
  [4] There is no error in principle in the sentence imposed. In my view, the 
  fresh evidence which is relied upon which purports to show that Mr. Saddler 
  has made serious attempts at rehabilitation is belied by the fact that during 
  the period of supposed rehabilitation and while on bail, Mr. Saddler was convicted 
  once again of theft under and sentenced to 30 days' incarceration. In those 
  circumstances, there is no basis or reason to interfere with the sentence imposed.</p>
