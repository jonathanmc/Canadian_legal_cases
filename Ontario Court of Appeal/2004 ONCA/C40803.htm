<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Susan E. Greer of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated April 29, 2003.</p>
<p>LANE J. ad hoc: </p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal from the decision of Greer J. granting the respondents' 
  motion to extend the two-year limitation period prescribed by s. 61(4) of the 
  Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.F.3 (the "FLA") until after the commencement 
  of this action and dismissing the summary judgment motions for dismissal of 
  the action brought by the appellants, St. Lawrence College of Applied Arts and 
  Technology ("College"), Gary James Palmer and the Clarkson Inn (referred 
  to collectively as "Palmer") and Gabriel Orsini ("Orsini") 
  (referred to collectively as " the appellants"). </p>
<p>
  [2] On October 31, 1998, Ronald Coutanche Jr. ("the deceased"), a 
  student at St. Lawrence College, attended a special event held by the College 
  that evening. The deceased consumed alcohol before and at the College event 
  and became intoxicated. He left the event and apparently went to the Napoleon 
  Delicatessen from which he was ejected. He hailed a cab driven by the defendant 
  William Larkin, and asked to be, and was, taken to the intersection of Highway 
  401 and Boundary Road, from which he apparently meant to hitch a ride to Smith's 
  Falls. At the time of the accident he was walking on or beside highway 401, 
  near Cornwall, at about 1 a.m., when he was struck and killed by one or both 
  of two passing motorists, the appellants Palmer and Orsini. </p>
<p>
  [3] The respondents are the deceased's parents and siblings. Their action is 
  a derivative claim under Part V of the FLA. The statement of claim in this action 
  was issued on February 22, 2002, more than three years and three months after 
  the fatal accident. There are thus issues of the timeliness of the commencement 
  of the action.</p>
<p>
  [4] The motion judge found that special circumstances existed which warranted 
  an extension of the limitation period, that the discoverability principle applied, 
  and that an extension of the limitation period was warranted under s. 2(8) of 
  the FLA. The action is at an early stage and the motion was dealt with on the 
  basis of the pleadings and affidavits. No viva voce evidence was heard.</p>
<p>
  [5] There are two main issues raised on this appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) did the motion judge err in finding that the discoverability 
  rule was applicable to the facts of this case?</p>
<p class="indent">(b) did the motion judge err in extending the limitation period 
  pursuant to s. 2(8) of the FLA? </p>
<p>
  [6] Part V of the FLA deals with dependants' claims for damages under the FLA 
  and their right to sue in tort. Section 61(4) sets out the limitation period 
  for actions under the FLA: </p>
<p class="indent">
  61(4). No action shall be brought under subsection (1) after the expiration 
  of two years from the time the cause of action arose.</p>
<p>
  [7] Under s.2 (8) of the FLA, the Court may, on motion, extend a time prescribed 
  by the Act if it is satisfied that: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) there are apparent grounds for relief;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) relief is unavailable because of delay that has been incurred 
  in good faith; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) no person will suffer substantial prejudice by reason of 
  the delay.</p>
<p>
  [8] The respondents' position before the motion judge, and on the appeal, was 
  that the facts surrounding the fatal accident were unclear to them following 
  this tragedy. As a result of a complaint by Janet Coutanche, the mother of the 
  deceased, the Ontario Alcohol and Gaming Commission held a hearing to investigate 
  the circumstances surrounding the intoxication of the deceased on the night 
  of the accident. Mrs. Coutanche was the family member who was primarily conducting 
  the investigation into her son's death. Mrs. Coutanche's evidence on the motion 
  was that she was unaware of the limitation period and believed she did not need 
  to do anything until the Gaming Commission hearing was conducted and a decision 
  was released. At that time, Mrs. Coutanche intended to determine her course 
  of action.</p>
<p>
  [9] The evidence at the Gaming Commission hearing was heard in February 2000, 
  and Mrs. Coutanche attended. The Gaming Commission's decision to revoke the 
  licence of the College was delivered in May 2000. Mrs. Coutanche's evidence 
  was that, although informed by telephone in May about the decision to revoke 
  the licence, she did not receive a copy of the decision then or ever.</p>
<p>
  [10] The respondents also consulted a solicitor, Mr. Kirkland, shortly after 
  the accident, to investigate the matter for them. He corresponded with the OPP 
  to obtain the details of their investigation and the statements of Mr. Orsini 
  and Mr. Larkin. He received this information in January 1999 and it is clear 
  that Mrs. Coutanche had reviewed the police report by September 14, 1999. There 
  may have been some failure of communication between the respondents and Mr. 
  Kirkland, because Mrs. Coutanche said that she was surprised to learn, later, 
  that no action had been begun after the Gaming Commission's decision of May 
  2000.</p>
<p>
  [11] The position of the appellants on the motion, and before us, was that there 
  were no issues of discoverability to trigger that rule and no circumstances 
  to justify resort to s. 2(8) of the FLA. Well within the limitation period, 
  the respondents knew the identities of the two drivers; knew that the deceased 
  was intoxicated at death; knew that he had been drinking at the College; knew 
  the level of that intoxication from the coroner's report; knew the potential 
  liability of a bar serving intoxicated patrons, (because the mother of the deceased 
  had owned a bar); and knew, from attending the hearing, what the evidence was 
  as to that potential liability. The respondents therefore had all the information 
  necessary to commence proceedings against each appellant. Neither the mother's 
  unawareness of the limitation, nor the possibility that their solicitor may 
  not have acted as instructed was a proper basis for an extension.</p>
<p>The Motion Judge's Reasons </p>
<p> [12] The motion judge reviewed the facts as set out above and turned her attention 
  to the discoverability rule. She noted the decision of this court in Peixeiro<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a>, 
  where the court referred to the injustice of time running against a plaintiff 
  when there was no possibility of bringing an action, and continued: </p>
<p class="indent">13. The evidence before me is that the deceased's mother was unaware of any 
  limitation period for the commencement of such an action. In addition, as the 
  family member who was really making all the investigation into what had taken 
  place that had or may have caused her son's death, the mother saw the need to 
  wait until the Hearing had taken place and a decision reached regarding the 
  College's role the night of the function attended by her son.</p>
<p>[13] At paragraph 15, the motion judge stated that whether the respondents 
  were reasonably diligent in obtaining sufficient information to determine whether 
  a cause of action existed is an issue of fact to be determined at trial. </p>
<p>
  [14] Later, at paragraph 17 of her reasons, the motion judge discussed the role 
  of counsel who had been engaged to succeed the original counsel for the respondents, 
  and found that it was understandable that new counsel could not issue a statement 
  of claim immediately, given that this accident involved "complicated circumstances 
  as to how the deceased came to be on Highway 401 in the middle of the night 
  and who should be sued." She thus accepted the major explanation of the 
  plaintiffs for the delay subsequent to the release of the findings of the Gaming 
  Commission.</p>
<p>
  [15] At paragraph 20, the motion judge rejected the inference that the mother 
  of the deceased, as a former owner of a bar, must have been aware of the potential 
  liability of the College; the law in the area was evolving.</p>
<p>
  [16] Finally, beginning at paragraph 21, the motion judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">21. While the mother may have known that her son had been drinking 
  at the College function, she did not know what the College's position was going 
  to be, nor did she know what the outcome of the Hearing would be. The affidavits 
  of the siblings show this. In my view, the circumstances of this case do fit 
  within those 'peculiar circumstances' that the Supreme Court of Canada described 
  in Basarsky<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a>, supra. The deceased was not 
  a passenger in a vehicle at the time of the accident, was not driving a vehicle 
  at the time of the accident but was alive and walking or hitch-hiking in the 
  middle of the night on Canada's major highway. The circumstances as to how the 
  deceased happened to be on that highway are peculiar, since it now appears that 
  he had been left near the highway, in a drunken state, by an unknown taxicab 
  driver.<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> </p>
<p class="indent">22.Under these circumstances, I am satisfied that the discoverability 
  rule applies, and that these peculiar circumstances fall within apparent grounds 
  for relief to extend the limitation prescribed by the FLA. The delay was incurred 
  in good faith. Order to go extending the limitation accordingly.</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>
  [17] There are a number of issues in this case, each of which requires its own 
  analysis. In relation to the first ground of appeal, namely, did the motion 
  judge err in finding that the discoverability rule was applicable to the facts 
  of this case, there are three themes: i) the respondents' unawareness of the 
  limitation; ii) whether there must be 'special circumstances' as described in 
  the Basarsky line of cases in order to rely on discoverability; and iii) the 
  application of the discoverability principle to the facts of this case including 
  whether the discoverability issue should be dealt with defendant by defendant, 
  or globally, as the motion judge did. In relation to the second ground of appeal, 
  namely, did the motion judge err in extending the limitation period pursuant 
  to s. 2 (8) of the FLA there are two themes: i) whether the statutory criteria 
  in s. 2(8) of the FLA have been met; and ii) whether there is an added requirement, 
  beyond s. 2(8) of the FLA, of 'special circumstances'.</p>
<p>
  1. Did the motion judge err in finding that the discoverability rule was applicable 
  to the facts of this case?</p>
<p>i) the plaintiffs' unawareness of the limitation</p>
<p> [18] The plaintiffs' ignorance of the limitation period is referred to three 
  times<a href="#a">[4]</a><a name="4"></a> in the Reasons and submissions were 
  made to us that the motion judge had erred in giving any weight to this fact. 
  Reference was made to the decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal in Hill<a href="#a">[5]</a><a name="5"></a> 
  where the point was made that error as to, or ignorance of the law did not postpone 
  the running of a limitation period. A slightly fuller discussion of the point 
  is found in Luscar<a href="#a">[6]</a><a name="6"></a> at paragraph 127: </p>
<p class="indent">127. What is it that must be discovered? Discovery applies to the facts, not 
  the law. This point is made in the recent decision of this court in The Royal 
  Canadian Legion Norwood (Alberta) Branch 178 v. The City of Edmonton (1994), 
  149 A.R. 25, 16 Alta. L.R. (3d) 305 (C.A.). In that case, the issue of whether 
  s. 4(1)(e) of the Limitations Act refers to discovery of the facts or the law 
  was directly addressed at p. 9 where Lieberman J.A. adopted the reasoning of 
  an earlier decision in the same court: </p>
<p class="indent">The issue of whether "discovery" applies to the facts or to the law 
  or to both was addressed by this court in Hill v. South Alberta Land Registration 
  District (1993), 135 A.R. 266; 33 W.A.C. 266; 8 Alta. L.R. (3d) 379. In that 
  decision C&ocirc;t&eacute;, J.A., delivering the unanimous judgment of the court, 
  referred to a case comment on the trial judgment then under appeal and said 
  at p. 385: </p>
<p class="indent">Discoverability relates to facts, not law. Error or ignorance of the law, or 
  uncertainty of the law, does not postpone any limitation period.</p>

<p>
  [19] Thus, to the extent that the motion judge relied on the plaintiffs' unawareness 
  of the limitation period in her analysis of the discoverability issue, she was 
  in error. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs' ignorance of the existence of a limitation 
  is a possible factor in the good faith analysis under s. 2 (8) of the FLA.</p>
<p> ii) whether there must be special circumstances in order to rely on discoverability</p>
<p> [20] In paragraphs 20 and 21 of the Reasons, the motion judge referred to 
  the requirement of 'special circumstances' as mentioned in Basarsky and similar 
  cases, in the context of both discoverability and s. 2 (8) of the FLA. As to 
  the question of when there must be 'special circumstances' shown, it should 
  be observed that the leading 'special circumstances' cases, such as Basarsky<a href="#a">[7]</a><a name="7"></a>, 
  Deaville<a href="#a">[8]</a><a name="8"></a>, and Mazzuca<a href="#a">[9]</a><a name="9"></a> 
  are all cases concerned with the court's exercise of the power of amendment 
  despite the expiry of the relevant limitation period. The inherent power of 
  the court to intervene in such cases is a very old and established power. As 
  early as 1887 in Weldon<a href="#a">[10]</a><a name="10"></a> it was described 
  by Lord Esher M.R. as a settled rule of practice that in special circumstances 
  amendments may be permitted after the intervention of a limitation. Mazzuca 
  confirmed that those principles continue to apply to the added party and amendment 
  rules -Rule 5.04(2) and Rule 26.01 - in the present day.</p>
<p>
  [21] Is there a requirement for 'special circumstances' in applying the discoverability 
  rule? In a very real sense, the conditions required to engage the discoverability 
  rule are themselves 'special circumstances' and the argument is circular. What 
  could be more 'special' than the fact that the plaintiff, acting diligently, 
  was unaware of the possibility of an action? Once that principle is engaged, 
  there is no need for additional hurdles for parties to surmount to avoid abusing 
  the process of the court.</p>
<p> [22] More fundamentally, the discoverability rule is not concerned with the 
  expiry of the limitation, but with its commencement, a point made by this court 
  in Zapfe<a href="#a">[11]</a><a name="11"></a> at paragraphs 46 and 47. The 
  analysis of the court's powers when a limitation has expired is not necessarily 
  appropriate to the very different issue presented by the concept of discoverability 
  and its impact upon the commencement of the running of time. The latter has 
  been described by this court in Zapfe at paragraphs 24, 32 and 33: </p>
<p class="indent">24. As appears from the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in Central Trust Co. and Peixeiro, the discoverability principle rests by definition 
  on the requirement of due diligence by the plaintiff. Judicial respect for that 
  requirement is inherent to proper regard for the diligence policy rationale, 
  which underlies limitations statutes. That requirement dictates the test to 
  be applied in determining the start of a limitation period under the discoverability 
  principle: when can it be said that the plaintiff knew, or by reasonable diligence 
  could have discovered, the material facts on which to base a cause of action 
  against the proposed defendant? </p>
<p class="indent">32. Second, in Aguonie,<a href="#a">[12]</a><a name="12"></a> 
  the discoverability principle was held to apply to the identity of the tortfeasor 
  and, in addition, to the acts or omissions of a potential tortfeasor identifying 
  him or her as such. Justice Borins (ad hoc), writing on behalf of the court 
  in Aguonie, stated, at p. 170 O.R.: </p>
<p class="indent"> While it is true that many of the cases in which [the discoverability 
  principle] has been applied concern a plaintiff's discovery of the extent of 
  an injury, or the delayed effect or result of a defendant's negligence, this 
  case concerns the discovery of a tortfeasor. The discovery of a tortfeasor involves 
  more than the identity of one who may be liable. It involves the discovery of 
  his or her acts, or omissions, which constitute liability.</p>
<p class="indent">33. Later in his reasons, Borins J. (ad hoc) said (at p. 172 
  O.R.): </p>
<p class="indent">
  The starting point for the application of the discoverability rule . . . is 
  the time when the appellants' cause of action arose. This will define the starting 
  date of the limitation period. It is a question of fact when the cause of action 
  arose and when the limitation period commenced. The application of the discoverability 
  rule is premised on the finding of these facts: when the appellants learned 
  they had a cause of action against the respondents; or, when, through the exercise 
  of reasonable diligence, they ought to have learned they had a cause of action 
  against the respondents. These facts constitute genuine issues for trial . . 
  .</p>
<p>
  [23] I conclude that there is no requirement to find additional special circumstances 
  when applying the discoverability rule.</p>
<p>
  iii) the application of the discoverability principle to the facts of this case, 
  including whether the discoverability issue should be dealt with defendant by 
  defendant and</p>
<p>
  [24] Applying these principles to the present case, the issue on discoverability 
  is when the plaintiffs learned that they had a cause of action against the defendants, 
  or when, with reasonable diligence, they ought to have done so. Given the widely 
  varying circumstances of the several defendants, such an analysis must deal 
  separately with each defendant, even though the result may well be that the 
  limitation began on different dates for different defendants.</p>
<p>
  [25] In performing the analysis, it must not be forgotten, as Borins J. noted 
  in Aguonie, supra, and as the motion judge correctly observed in her Reasons, 
  that these are issues of fact, and unless the evidence before the motion judge 
  leaves no doubt, they are issues of fact for a trial.</p>
<p>
  [26] As to the two drivers, Orsini and Palmer, it is clear that all the information 
  about their identities and the statements made to the police, plus the latter's 
  report, were readily available with any degree of diligence, and were actually 
  obtained by solicitor Kirkland, by early 1999. It is not necessary to answer 
  the question of how and why the deceased went to the highway and walked on it 
  in order to decide if there was a cause of action against one or both of these 
  drivers for running him down. Nor was it necessary to determine which driver 
  did it. It is highly likely that only a trial could answer that question. Perfect 
  certainty is not necessary. The reasonable person would have known by the receipt 
  of the police information in early 1999, or at the latest by the time Mrs. Coutanche 
  reviewed the police report in September, 1999, that there was a possible claim 
  against these drivers. There is no room on the record before us for the application 
  of discoverability to delay the commencement of the running of the limitation 
  against the drivers for a sufficient period to bring the start of the limitation 
  to February 22, 2000, two years before the commencement of the action. </p>
<p>
  [27] The same cannot be said with certainty of the case against the College. 
  The College committed no tort by serving alcohol at its event. If there was 
  a tort, it consisted of serving the deceased after he had become intoxicated. 
  Whether those serving the deceased at the event did so was not obvious and there 
  is certainly an arguable case for delaying action until the facts were explored 
  at the hearing, or perhaps even until the Gaming Commission issued its reasons. 
  The Gaming Commission hearing was held February 22 and 23, 2000, exactly two 
  years before the action was commenced, and the respondents have offered explanations, 
  which might be accepted, concerning why they unable to discover their cause 
  of action before the hearing took place. The defendants submit that these explanations 
  fall short, but the motion judge found them plausible and we are not prepared 
  to say, on this record, that the explanations could not be accepted by the trial 
  judge on a full record. Discoverability could, therefore, be of assistance to 
  the plaintiff in delaying the commencement of the limitation so far as the College 
  is concerned, but the evidence in this record is sufficiently problematic that 
  the facts should be determined at the trial.</p>
<p>
  [28] The remaining defendants have not appealed and there is no reason to consider 
  their particular facts in these reasons.</p>
<p>
  2. Did the motion judge err in extending the limitation period pursuant to s. 
  2(8) of the FLA?</p>
<p>
  i) have the statutory criteria in s. 2(8) of the FLA been met?</p>
<p>
  [29] Turning from discoverability to s. 2(8) of the FLA, the first issue is 
  whether the conditions of the statute have been met. They are: that there are 
  apparent grounds for relief; that relief is unavailable because of delay that 
  has been incurred in good faith; and that no person will suffer substantial 
  prejudice by reason of the delay.</p>
<p>
  [30] There is some dispute as to what the relief is that is mentioned in the 
  first condition. Is it the relief sought in the proposed action, or is it relief 
  from the limitation? This issue is answered by examining the second condition, 
  which is that relief is unavailable because of the delay. The only such relief 
  is that in the main action which is unavailable because of the expiry of the 
  limitation period. Therefore the first condition is that there are apparent 
  grounds for the relief sought in the action. It is clear in this case that there 
  are such grounds as against the drivers and the College.</p>
<p>
  [31] On both the first and second requirements, it was submitted that certain 
  admissions made by Mrs. Coutanche on her examination, to the effect that she 
  did not think that it was wrong that the vehicles hit her son; and evidence 
  from the siblings that they were advised not to bring an action, meant that 
  either she knew that there was no reasonable cause of action here, or the delay 
  was not incurred in good faith. On the other hand, it was said that Mrs. Coutanche 
  was not a witness to the accident and her admission amounts to an opinion and 
  not an admission of a relevant fact. She has the right to test that conclusion 
  if she wishes. Neither her evidence nor the lawyer's advice to the co-plaintiffs 
  is an admission that there is no cause of action. There are many other reasons 
  why such advice might be given. On this state of the evidence, in my view, it 
  was an error to decide this issue upon a motion, without cross-examination in 
  the presence of the trier of fact.</p>
<p>
  [32] The second requirement is that the delay, which has made the relief unavailable, 
  has been incurred in good faith. The motion judge so found. However, she did 
  so in the context of a misunderstanding of the role of the mother's unawareness 
  of the limitation, as well as great uncertainty in the evidence as to what instructions 
  were given to solicitor Kirkland and indeed what he was retained to do. In these 
  circumstances, there is an issue of fact for trial on this point and the order 
  in appeal cannot stand.</p>
<p>
  [33] The third requirement is that no person will suffer substantial prejudice 
  by reason of the delay. It is important to observe that the prejudice at issue 
  here is prejudice from the delay and not prejudice from the making of the order 
  sought to extend the time.</p>
<p>
  [34] In Deaville, supra, this court held that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; the expiry of the limitation period creates a presumption, however slight 
  in some cases, of prejudice to the defendant. It may be that the mere recitation 
  of the facts and history of the case makes it clear there is no prejudice to 
  the defendant and it can be inferred that he knew, within the limitation period, 
  of the case and the nature of the claims now being made against him. Alternatively, 
  the defendant may file material which establishes prejudice.</p>
<p>
  [35] None of the defendants filed affidavits to establish prejudice. There is 
  no evidence that witnesses have died or become unavailable. Counsel for the 
  Palmer defendants conceded that the insured received notice of the loss at the 
  incident and that "one can only assume that it was shortly thereafter" 
  that he notified his insurer. A request for the insurer's knowledge as to when 
  it was notified was not answered. A similar assumption may well be justified 
  as to the defendant Orsini. The College became aware of the complaint by Mrs. 
  Coutanche well within the limitation period. While it appears that the appellants 
  may not have suffered prejudice, in the circumstances, this too is an issue 
  for the trier of fact.</p>
<p>
  ii) whether there is an added requirement, beyond s. 2 (8) of the FLA, of 'special 
  circumstances'</p>
<p>
  [36] As already noted, in paragraphs 20 and 21 of the Reasons, the motion judge 
  referred to the requirement of 'special circumstances' in the context of both 
  discoverability and s. 2(8) of the FLA. As with the discoverability rule, the 
  conditions required to engage s. 2(8) of the FLA are themselves 'special circumstances' 
  and any suggestion that more is required is circular. In any event, I see no 
  basis for reading additional requirements into what is a clear statutory provision.</p>
<p>
  IV. Disposition </p>
<p>
  [37] In the result, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of Greer J. 
  relating to the extension of the limitation period insofar as it affects the 
  appellants, and substitute the following order: i) all issues relating to the 
  respondents' request for an extension of the limitation period in respect of
