<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are conscious of the seriousness of the offence which obviously caused 
  great trauma to the victim and his parents.</p>
<p>[2] The respondent has lived through a horrific childhood. He was 18 years 
  of age at the time of the offence. He has no criminal record.</p>
<p> [3] In these circumstances, the 18 months conditional sentence and 45 days 
  of pre-trial detention sufficiently reflects the principles of deterrence and 
  denunciation and is not demonstrably unfit. </p>
<p>[4] There is no need to impose a curfew. The rules of Covenant House, including 
  its curfew, are appropriate. </p>
<p>[5] The trial judge was in error in not ordering a DNA analysis. The appeal 
  is allowed only in that respect.</p>
<p>[6] A DNA order is to issue in terms of draft order.</p>
