<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We agree with Echlin J. that the defence of misrepresentation is defeated 
  by the strict terms of the guarantee. The other defences proposed by the Parravanos 
  on the hearing of the motion for summary judgment and our response to them are 
  as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">(1) The Bank's representation that it wouldn't sue on the guarantee 
  pending resolution of an insurance claim by the borrower - There was no consideration 
  from the Parravanos to the Bank for this promise. The Bank is not bound by it. 
  In fact the Bank forbore for 18 months.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The Bank failed to fully advance on a loan to the borrowers 
  - The Parravanos were out of covenant on the ratio of assets to liquidity due 
  to their insurance claim. In these circumstances the Bank was not obliged to 
  fully advance the money.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The Bank should have applied certain funds it received in 
  account of the guaranteed loan and not an entire loan. The Bank's General Security 
  Agreement and loan agreement confer an unfettered discretion on the Bank insofar 
  as the appropriation of payments is concerned. </p>
<p class="indent">(4) The allegation that the Bank approved the sale of the borrowers' 
  business assets when it ought not to have done so is also without merit as the 
  receiver was appointed by the court and the court approved the sale. The Bank 
  simply did not oppose it. </p>
<p>[2] Costs of the appeal to the Bank fixed in the amount of $2,000, all-inclusive.
