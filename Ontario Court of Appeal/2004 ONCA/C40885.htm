    Mr. Shaw, Mr. Allen, Mr. Sholdice, Mr. Crocker and Mr. Bell. It was the frequent

    the Marinos that they could remain in the home and that the trustee would 
    make no claim against the home, as the trustee did not feel it worthwhile

    the circumstances of this case. This court distinguished <i>Zemlak</i> and 
    permitted a trustee in bankruptcy, following his discharge and that of the 
    bankrupts, to take proceedings to pursue two properties, the values of which 
    had been misrepresented by the bankrupts in their statements of affairs: <i>Rocher 
    v. H. &amp; M. Diamond &amp; Associates</i> (2003), <span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>43 C.B.R. (4th) 
    134</span>. Even in instances short of misrepresentation or other misconduct 
    by the bankrupt, it is not difficult to think of examples where an exception 
    to the proposition would be appropriate. One is where an asset previously 
    unknown to the trustee is discovered within a reasonable time of his application 
    for discharge. Another is where the trustee learns within a reasonable time 
    of his application for discharge that an asset previously considered to be 
    unrealizable in fact had realizable value. In both examples, assuming that 
    the asset is one which should, in the interests of the creditors of the estate, 
    be realized, the court must retain some discretion to decide whether the proposition 
    does or does not apply. Failure to imbue the rule with some measure of flexibility 
    renders a trustee's application for discharge a trap for the unwary [footnotes

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I agree. On the facts of this case, including 
    the fact that the trustee was not discharged and that the trustees Final 
    Statement to Mr. Marino stated its newfound view that there was equity in 
    the property, the trustee cannot be said to have determined that the asset<span

    proceeded with upgrades to the property. But for the trustees assurance, 
    the Marinos could have earlier begun the fresh start contemplated by the
