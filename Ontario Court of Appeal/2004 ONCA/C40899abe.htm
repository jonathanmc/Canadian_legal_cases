<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We see no merit to the constitutional argument. In our view, the proportionality 
  issue was dealt with and determined against the appellant in Winko. See in particular 
  IP107ff.</p>
<p>[2] We are also satisfied that the finding of detention in hospital was not 
  unreasonable. There was evidence from Dr. Gojer to support the finding and the 
  Board's decision was entitled to deference.</p>
<p>[3] However, in light of Tulikorpi and Pinet the Board's decision cannot stand. 
  The Board had to apply the least onerous and least restrictive test to the level 
  of detention and to the conditions. The Board, however, used the standard of 
  &quot;appropriate&quot; with respect to the conditions, did not specify the 
  level of detention and purported to permit the hospital to move the appellant 
  between medium and minimum and back again.</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the case is remitted to the Board 
  for a re-hearing. We would ask that the re-hearing be expedited. </p>
