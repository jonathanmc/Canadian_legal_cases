<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The applications judge made findings of fact which were supported by the 
  evidence and which are determinative of the issues.</p>
<p>[2] The 2000 bylaw, which mandated fencing for kennels, was passed six months 
  after the appellant's competitor was elected to council. The 2001 bylaw, which 
  regulated commercial animal kennels, was not alleged by the appellant to be 
  discriminatory.</p>
<p>[3] In any event, both bylaws were passed for the general regulation of dog 
  kennels. The appellant failed to establish that, in passing either bylaw, the 
  township acted with &quot;illegality&quot; (the Act, s. 136): that it acted 
  in bad faith or arbitrarily. The appellant also failed to establish that the 
  bylaws were discriminatory or in restraint of trade. The applications judge 
  found the appellant's allegations of ulterior motive to be speculative.</p>
<p>[4] The applications judge was persuaded that both bylaws are reasonable and 
  in the public interest; they were responsive to community concerns. He was correct 
  in refusing to quash the bylaws.</p>
<p>[5] Given our view of the merits, there is no need to consider the limitation 
  period issue.</p>
<p>[6] Costs are awarded to the respondent, payable by the appellant, fixed in 
  the amount of $5,679.03, inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
