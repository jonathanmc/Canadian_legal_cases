<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant argues that the motions judge erred in granting summary judgment 
  on the basis of laches and delay because they were not pleaded by the respondent 
  and the respondent failed to seek a pleadings amendment at or prior to the motion 
  for summary judgment. We disagree. </p>
<p>[2] Although laches and delay were not specifically pleaded (but expiry of 
  a limitation period was pleaded), they were clearly raised in the respondent's 
  factum on the summary judgment motion, the appellant responded to these issues 
  in her factum, and laches and delay were fully argued before the motions judge. 
  Accordingly, the appellant was not taken by surprise by this argument and suffered 
  no prejudice.</p>
<p>[3] As well, the appellant did not seek an adjournment of the motion in order 
  to file further evidence or to re-open cross-examinations. Both options were 
  open to her.</p>
<p>[4] The record before the motions judge clearly established that the appellant 
  knew by 1989 that she had a claim against the respondent for damages for abuse 
  and that her time to advance such a claim may be running out. She failed to 
  commence proceedings until 2002, about 13 years later.</p>
<p>[5] In these circumstances, the motions judge was correct in granting summary 
  judgment on the basis of laches and delay. The appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>[6] The appellant did not pursue her appeal on the matter of the costs of the 
  proceedings before the motions judge. The costs awarded to the respondent by 
  the motions judge were significant. We are not persuaded, in the circumstances, 
  that any costs award should be made in this proceeding.</p>
