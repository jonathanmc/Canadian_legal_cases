<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The costs award of $60,000 for a straight-forward, one-day hearing before 
  the Divisional Court is unsustainable and reflects several errors in the discretion 
  exercised. </p>
<p>[2] Given the issues involved and the inadequacy of the evidence on preparation 
  time, the amount is grossly excessive. It is disproportionately higher than 
  other costs awards for similar types of proceedings. It is, moreover, so demonstrably 
  inflated, that it violates the compensation principles underlying the costs 
  grid, and offends against any reasonably anticipated costs award by the unsuccessful 
  party.</p>
<p>[3] We find $18,000 to be a fairer and more reasonable amount.</p>
<p>[4] We would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the costs award, and order 
  that costs be paid in the total amount of $18,000.</p>
<p>[5] Costs of this appeal and the leave application in the total amount of $5,000.</p>
