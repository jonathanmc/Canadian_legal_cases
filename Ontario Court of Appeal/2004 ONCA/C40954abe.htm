<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are not persuaded that this sentence was unfit. This was a serious offence 
  committed while the appellant was on probation for a similar offence. Given 
  her prior record and the fact that she has had the benefit of a conditional 
  sentence and still re-offended, we see no error in this sentence. There was 
  some evidence of mental illness, contrary to the finding of the trial judge. 
  However, there was no evidence linking her mental illness to this offence.</p>
<p>[2] The probation condition regarding the appellant's residence is in keeping 
  with the intent and purpose of s. 732(3)(h). We do not agree that it is unduly 
  punitive but consider it to be integrally linked to the offence committed by 
  the appellant. However, the wording of the order should be amended to reflect 
  the precise terms of the trial judge's reasons as follows: &quot;If sharing 
  accommodation or residing in a private residence, you must advise the landlord 
  or owner of your prior criminal record.&quot; We would therefore grant leave 
  to appeal and allow the appeal by amending the terms of the probation as set 
  out above, but otherwise dismiss the appeal.</p>
