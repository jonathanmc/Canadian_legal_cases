<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants' motion to stay this appeal is dismissed. Their subsequent 
  action is based upon facts that were known to them at the time they brought 
  the application seeking rescission, relief also sought in new action. The appellants 
  put their case against the respondents in the terms of the application, lost, 
  and appealed that result. They should not now be permitted to delay the final 
  resolution of that matter on the basis of these late blooming allegations.</p>
<p> [2] The only issue for us is whether the application judge erred in her interpretation 
  of Schedule A, para. 6 of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale. In our view, she 
  did not. Nor do we accept the argument advanced before us that (1) the respondent 
  is obliged under the Agreement of Purchase and Sale to remove obstacles impeding 
  the appellants' right of access or (2) that the appellants are entitled to make 
  physical changes to the respondent's property to facilitate access.</p>
<p> [3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. Costs to the respondent fixed at 
  $8,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
