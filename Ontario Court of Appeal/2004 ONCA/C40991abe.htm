<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] There is no issue that the appellant is a farmer. We see no requirement 
  in the Farm Debt Mediation Act, 1997 that the appellant, in order to take advantage 
  of the notice provision in s. 21, he must first demonstrate that he is an insolvent 
  farmer. Having regard to the language of sections 21 and 22 of the Act, we see 
  no answer to Mr. Jaeger's submission that the respondent was not entitled to 
  take proceedings to enforce his security without first serving the notice under 
  s. 21. All of the proceedings that followed the failure to serve that notice 
  are, as provided in s. 22, null and void.</p>
<p>[2] The provisions of the order of Harris J. relating to the appellant's contempt 
  of court should also be set aside, both because they were taken without prior 
  notice to him and because the alleged contempt has been purged by payment of 
  the costs to which those provisions related.</p>
<p>[3] The appeal is allowed, the order of Harris J. is set aside and the respondent's 
  motion for summary judgment is dismissed.</p>
<p>[4] There will be no costs to or against either party on the motion before 
  Harris J. We would not disturb the order for costs of $750.00 made by Justice 
  Henderson. The appellant is entitled to his costs of this appeal, which we fix 
  in the amount of $5,000.00, inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements, and which 
  are payable by the respondent forthwith, without right of set-off.</p>
