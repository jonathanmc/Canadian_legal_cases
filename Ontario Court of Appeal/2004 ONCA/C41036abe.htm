<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant raises three issue on appeal:</p>
<p class="indent">1. The appellant submits that the motions judge should have 
  forgiven the arrears of support for the entire time he was in Iran instead of 
  half the time. The motions judge gave reasons at para. 29 of her endorsement 
  why she forgave only ten months of arrears. Her order is discretionary and despite 
  Mr. Simpson's able argument, we are not persuaded that she committed a reviewable 
  error. </p>
<p class="indent">2. The appellant argues that the trial judge wrongly imputed 
  too much income to him for the ten month period after his return from Iran. 
  Again, the trial judge exercised her discretion, and did so having regard to 
  the letter at tabs 24-26 of the Appeal Book. We see no reviewable error on this 
  issue. </p>
<p class="indent">3. Finally, the appellant appeals the costs order on the basis 
  that he was partly successful on the motion. Undoubtedly, the motion judge took 
  account of the appellant's partial success in ordering a modest amount for costs. 
  We see no error in her costs award.</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. The appellant shall pay costs to 
  the Family Law Office in the amount of $5,500, and costs to the City of Ottawa 
  in the amount of $2,500, each amount inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
