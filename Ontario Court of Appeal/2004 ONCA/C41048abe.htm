<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The only appeal before us today is from the order of Justice Day which 
  dismissed in its entirety the application of the appellants for failure to post 
  the security for costs ordered by Justice Greer.</p>
<p>[2] There is nothing in the material before us to suggest any error in the 
  order of Justice Day. The security for costs required by Justice Greer was not 
  provided and as a result Justice Day had no choice except to dismiss the application.</p>
<p>[3] Before us the appellants assert as they did before Justice Greer that Mrs. 
  Li is the only lawful wife of the deceased. That is not an issue which we can 
  address in this appeal. This appeal is confined to Justice Day's order which 
  was based on the failure to pay security for costs.</p>
<p>[4] The appeal must be dismissed with costs fixed at $5,000.</p>
