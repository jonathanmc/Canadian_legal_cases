<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant contends that Crown counsel's reference to him before he 
  arrived in court was prejudicial. We disagree. It was innocuous.</p>
<p>[2] He also contends that he was misled by four independent lawyers who mistakenly 
  urged him not to testify on his own behalf. The fact that the appellant relied 
  on the legal advice he received hardly renders his trial unfair.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant contends that the trial judge misapplied the definition of 
  theft in s. 322 of the Code, that he failed to deal properly with conflicting 
  evidence and that the conviction was unsafe and unreasonable. We disagree. The 
  trial judge's reasons are full, careful and fair.</p>
<p>[4] The appellant contends that there was inadequate disclosure of two of the 
  three video tapes entered as exhibits. However, the transcript discloses that 
  at the trial the appellant explicitly agreed to the admission of the tapes.</p>
<p>[5] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
