<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] It would appear from the materials and submissions before us that the motion 
  judge was given less than a full picture of the merits of the motion. For example, 
  the status of the plaintiff to commence the action was not raised before him. 
  In our view, there are several factors that strongly favour the setting aside 
  of the motion in default: (1) the haste with which the defendants were noted 
  in default; (2) the relatively short period of delay; (3) the absence of any 
  prejudice to the plaintiff; and (4) the availability of a defence.</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of Wright J. dismissing 
  the motion and his subsequent default judgment are set aside. There will be 
  an order that the noting of the defendants in default be set aside and that 
  time for delivery of a statement of defence is extended to May 27, 2004. There 
  will be no costs of the appeal. The order of Moldaver J.A. is extended to July 
  31, 2004.</p>
