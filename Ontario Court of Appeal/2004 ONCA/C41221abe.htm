<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant argues that the motions judge's decision offends the provisions 
  of the Personal Property Security Act (the &quot;PPSA&quot;) and the Consumer 
  Protection Act. He further asserts that clause 5 of the retail instalment contract 
  applicable to the Echo vehicle, under which the respondent repossessed the vehicle, 
  is void because it conflicts with the PPSA and is severable from the other terms 
  of the contract.</p>
<p>
  [2] We would not give effect to these submissions.</p>
<p>
  [3] The motions judge held that the respondent repossessed the Echo on the basis 
  that the respondent in good faith believed that the property that was the subject 
  matter of the contract (the Echo vehicle) was in jeopardy. The evidence supporting 
  this finding was overwhelming.</p>
<p>
  [4] In addition, we reject the appellant's argument that clause 5 of the contract 
  is void. Clause 5 does not exclude a purchaser's right to redeem the property, 
  or to reinstate the contract, where those statutory rights are properly triggered. 
  The motions judge concluded that the relevant sections of the PPSA and the Consumer 
  Protection Act did not apply given the basis upon which the respondent repossessed 
  the Echo. We agree. The repossession of the Echo vehicle was not based on any 
  default in payment by the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [5] Finally, we see no merit to the appellant's challenge of the interest component 
  of the judgment granted by the motions judge concerning the Camry vehicle.</p>
<p>
  [6] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. The respondent is entitled to its 
  costs of this appeal, fixed in the total amount of $2,964.74. </p>
