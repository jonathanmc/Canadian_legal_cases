class=msoChangeProp style='mso-prop-change:"Sophie Tantsis" 20041126T1024'></span></span></span></span></u></h4>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>On June 
    10 and 11, 2004, a panel of the Court of Appeal for Ontario composed of Justices 
    Charron, Feldman and Lang heard an appeal from the trial decision of Justice 
    Ellen Macdonald of the Ontario Superior Court involving a class-action constitutional 
    challenge to four sections of the <i>Canada Pension Plan </i>(“<i>CPP</i>”). 
    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>This class 
    action was brought by the surviving partners of same-sex couples, or their 
    estates, whose contributing partners died after April 17, 1985, the date that 
    s. 15(1) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </i>(the “<i>Charter</i>”) 
    came into force. In 2000, the federal government passed legislation in response 
    to <i>M. v. H.</i>, the 1999 decision in which the Supreme Court of Canada 
    struck down as unconstitutional the opposite-sex definition of “spouse” in 
    the Ontario <i>Family Law Act</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The class 
    members challenged two specific sections of that new legislation that applied 
    only to same-sex survivors and not to opposite sex survivors. Those specific 
    sections precluded the same-sex survivors from receiving survivors’ <i>CPP</i> 
    pensions retroactive to the month following the contributing partner’s death. 
    Two other general sections of the <i>CPP</i>, which existed prior to the new 
    legislation, apply to all pension claimants and impose a cap on the ability 
    of any survivor, whether same sex or opposite sex, to collect more than twelve 
    months of pension arrears.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The basis 
    for the class members’ constitutional challenge was s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i>. 
    <i></i></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>In a decision 
    released on December 19, 2003, the trial judge concluded that the two new 
    <i>CPP</i> sections breached the s. 15(1) <i>Charter</i> rights of the class 
    members. She struck down those sections and granted the class members a constitutional 
    exemption from the other two sections of general application.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>As a result of the trial judge’s decision, the class members became 
    entitled to pension arrears dating back to one month after the death of their 
    contributing partners who died after April 17, 1985, plus interest on pension 
    arrears from 1992.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The Attorney 
    General of Canada appealed the trial judge’s decision. The Attorney General 
    of Ontario intervened on the question of remedy.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>In a unanimous 
    judgment released today, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in part. The 
    court upheld the trial judge’s decision to strike down as unconstitutional 
    the two <i>CPP</i> sections that specifically applied only to same-sex survivors. 
    The court observed that </span>in formulating remedial legislation responsive 
    to a successful <i>Charter</i> challenge, one of the key issues that Parliament 
    must address is the extent to which the recognition of the <i>Charter</i> 
    right will have retrospective application and effect. In so doing, the remedial 
    legislation must itself be constitutional. This legislation was not. <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The 
    court also upheld the trial judge’s decision awarding the class members pre-judgment 
    interest on any pension arrears. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The court, 
    however, allowed the Attorney General of Canada’s appeal with respect to the 
    other two <i>CPP </i>sections that were of general application and set aside 
    the constitutional exemption granted by the trial judge. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>As a result 
    of the court’s decision today, the class members will receive retroactive 
    survivors’ pensions, limited in accordance with the sections of general application, 
    subject to the further proceedings of the class members before the trial judge</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE CHALLENGED SECTIONS</span></h4>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Four sections 
    of the <i>CPP</i> were at issue. Two new sections, the specific sections, 
    s. 44(1.1) and s. 72(2), were added to the <i>CPP</i> as a result of the <i>Modernization 
    of Obligations and Benefits Act </i>(<i>“MOBA”</i>). The <i>MOBA</i> reflects 
    the federal government’s response to <i>M. v. H</i>.<i> </i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>It was passed in July 2000 and is omnibus legislation 
    that amended sixty-eight federal statutes for the purpose of providing same-sex 
    couples the same rights and obligations as opposite-sex couples. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>The <i>MOBA</i> amended the <i>CPP</i> by removing the opposite-sex 
    definition of “spouse”. At the same time, the <i>MOBA</i> amendments introduced 
    specific sections that applied only to same-sex survivors. Those specific 
    sections provided as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4;mso-list-change:- kanjir 20041126T1012;
'> -<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> for a surviving same-sex partner to receive a survivor’s pension, 
    the contributing partner must have died on or after January 1, 1998 (s. 44(1.1)), 
    and </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4;mso-list-change:- kanjir 20041126T1012;
'> -<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> pensions would not be paid for any month before July 2000, the month 
    the <i>MOBA</i> came into force (s. 72(2)). </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Further, the <i>MOBA</i> amendments did not address two sections 
    of the <i>CPP</i> of general application, the general sections, s. 60(2) and 
    s. 72(1), that were already part of the <i>CPP</i>. These general sections 
    provide as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3;mso-list-change:- kanjir 20041126T1012;
'> -<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> the estate of any surviving partner may only receive a maximum of 
    twelve months’ pension and must apply for it within twelve months of the death 
    of the surviving partner (s. 60(2)), and </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3;mso-list-change:- kanjir 20041126T1012;
'> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> the payment of any pension arrears is limited to the twelve 
    months prior to the application for a survivor’s pension (s. 72(1)). <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'></span></p>

  <h5><b><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>The Attorney General 
    of Canada:</span></b></h5>
  <p class=MsoNormal>The Attorney General of Canada’s defence of the s.&nbsp;15(1) 
    challenge rested on three main arguments:</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span> 
    The different treatment of same-sex survivors in the specific sections is 
    not based on their sexual orientation. Rather, the legislative distinction 
    is based on the date of death of the contributing same-sex partner, which 
    is not a distinction prohibited by s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-mso-list:l2 level1 lfo5;mso-list-change:&quot;\(%1\:2\:0\:\)&quot; kanjir 20041126T1012;
'> (2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span> The <i>Charter</i> 
    should be interpreted in a manner that recognizes the evolving nature of societal 
    values. The time limitations in the <i>MOBA </i>amendments in s. 44(1.1) and 
    s. 72(2) were consistent with societal and judicial recognition of the rights 
    and obligations of partners in same-sex couples. Same-sex survivors did not 
    have equality rights to survivors’ pensions until the issue was identified 
    by gays and lesbians themselves, by Parliament, and by the courts, which did 
    not occur until the late 1990s.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-mso-list:l2 level1 lfo5;mso-list-change:&quot;\(%1\:3\:0\:\)&quot; kanjir 20041126T1012;
'> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span> Granting 
    the class members retroactive pensions from as early as April 17, 1985 would 
    amount to an impermissible retroactive application of the <i>Charter</i>.<b><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>&nbsp; 
    </span></b></p>
  <h5><b><span style='text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'>The Class Members: 
    </span></b></h5>
  <p class=MsoNormal>The class members took the position that they are entitled 
    to survivors’ pensions not from January&nbsp;1, 1998 or from July 2000 (as 
    prescribed by s. 44(1.1) and s. 72(2)), but from one month after the date 
    of death of the contributing partner, if the partner died after s. 15 of the 
    <i>Charter</i> came into force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They 
    argued that the challenged sections breach their equality rights under s. 
    15(1) of the <i>Charter</i> by disentitling them from receiving survivors’ 
    pensions equal with opposite-sex survivors from when their equality rights 
    came into force on April 17, 1985.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>The class members argued that<i> </i>their entitlement is 
    not weakened by the fact that Canadian society did not initially recognize 
    that discrimination based on sexual orientation was contrary to the <i>Charter</i>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Further, they argued that the federal government’s 
    unsuccessful attempt to remedy this inequality with the enactment of the <i>MOBA</i> 
    did not detract from these <i>Charter</i> rights.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In that sense, they argued, there was nothing 
    retroactive about their requested relief, as they were entitled to the relief 
    from April 17, 1985 onward. Furthermore, as conceded by the government, the 
    <i>CPP</i> fund would not be adversely affected in any significant way by 
    payment of retroactive pensions to the class members.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>CONSTITUTIONALITY 
    OF THE SPECIFIC SECTIONS</span></b></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>This court 
    upheld the trial judge’s decision that the specific sections, s. 44(1.1) and 
    s. 72(2), violated the class members’ equality rights under s. 15(1) of the 
    <i>Charter </i>and cannot be justified under s. 1, because the temporal distinctions 
    in those sections apply only to same-sex survivors and not to opposite-sex 
    survivors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Further, 
    the court observed that </span>same-sex surviving partners, by reason of their 
    sexual orientation, are already a vulnerable group, and one subject to stereotyping 
    as a result of that orientation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They 
    have the same need for survivors’ pensions as opposite-sex survivors whose 
    partners died before 1998 and who are receiving their pensions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The denial of those survivors’ pensions perpetuated the view that same-sex 
    survivors were less worthy of recognition than opposite-sex survivors, when 
    in fact, same-sex survivors were equally deserving of society’s concern, recognition, 
    and respect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The partners of same-sex 
    survivors contributed to the <i>CPP</i>, yet their surviving partners were 
    denied access to the federal pension program, a program that is a fundamental 
    pillar of Canada’s retirement income system. The denial of equal access to 
    such a fundamental social institution constituted a non-recognition of these 
    same-sex survivors as full members of Canadian society. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>As well, the evolutionary history of <span lang=EN-US
style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>the equality rights of same-sex couples </span>does 
    not assist the Attorney General of Canada. The trial judge found as a fact 
    that the Attorney General of Canada failed to demonstrate that same-sex relationship 
    issues were not in the minds of organizations, politicians and society until 
    the 1990s and this court was satisfied that there was evidence to support 
    this finding. Further, the Supreme Court of Canada has rejected the incremental 
    approach to recognition of equality rights urged by the Attorney General of 
    Canada. Therefore, while the new sections <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:
EN-US'>may have been part of the federal government’s attempt to recognize the 
    equal rights of same-sex couples following <i>M. v. H.</i>, the time restrictions 
    that the federal government included in the <i>MOBA</i> violated those same 
    rights and cannot stand.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Last, the 
    court also upheld the trial judge’s decision to strike the specific sections 
    entirely and not to suspend the declaration of invalidity. </span>Striking 
    down these specific sections does not leave any void that needs to be filled 
    by Parliament and, on the particular facts of this case, does not have any 
    adverse effect on the <i>CPP</i> fund or the public purse.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>In the result, and subject to the general sections discussed 
    below, the survivors of same-sex partners may apply for and are entitled to 
    survivors’ pensions on the same basis as the survivors of opposite-sex partners.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>CONSTITUTIONALITY 
    OF THE GENERAL SECTIONS</span></b></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>This court 
    held that the trial judge erred by granting a remedy against the general sections, 
    s. 60(2) and s. 72(1), when the constitutionality of these sections was not 
    challenged. The court overturned the trial judge’s remedy regarding s. 60(2) 
    and s. 72(1) of the <i>CPP</i> by setting aside the constitutional exemptions 
    granted to the class members by the trial judge from those sections. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>With respect 
    to s. 60(2), which deals with the rights of estates to survivors’ benefits, 
    the court held that, because s 15(1) rights are personal, they cannot be enforced 
    by estates, which are artificial entities, like corporations, and therefore 
    do not have equality rights under s. 15(1) of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Charter</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>. This is in accordance with established case law.</span></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The court 
    also concluded that s. 72(1) does not violate s. 15(1).</span><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The sections that prevented the class members 
    from receiving survivors’ pensions <span style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    of spouse that was in place before the <i>MOBA</i> amendments and the specific 
    sections of the <i>MOBA</i>, not the cap on arrears (s. 72(1)), nor the limitation 
    in respect of estate claims (s. 60(2)). Section 72(1) and s. 60(2) are non-discriminatory 
    in their purpose and effect.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>Having concluded that s. 60(2) and s. 72(1) did not violate 
    s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i>, this court set aside the constitutional exemption 
    granted by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>The court left to the trial judge the question of what arrears 
    are, in the result, owing to each class member. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='page-break-after:avoid'><b>INTEREST</b></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='page-break-after:avoid'>The court concluded that the

    interest on any pension payments that she finds owing to them.</p>
