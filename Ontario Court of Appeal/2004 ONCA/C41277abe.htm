<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] It is apparent from the trial judge's reasons that he was satisfied beyond 
  a reasonable doubt that the appellant used excessive force in restraining the 
  complainant. Accordingly, the appeal from conviction on the charge of assault 
  causing bodily harm is dismissed.</p>
<p>[2] As for the threatening charge, the elements were made out on the evidence 
  of Theresa Grossinger. The count in the information is amended accordingly, 
  given that the appellant suffered no prejudice. The appeal from conviction is 
  dismissed.</p>
<p>[3] With respect to sentence, the appeal is utterly without merit, so much 
  so that we would deny leave to appeal.</p>
