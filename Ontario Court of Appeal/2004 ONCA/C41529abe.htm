<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Both parties take the position that the circumstances of this case did 
  not warrant the sentencing judge's departure from the joint submission made 
  on sentencing of the appellant for robbery and breach of probation. The joint 
  submission was for a total sentence of 12 months, less credit for pre-trial 
  custody on a 2-for-1 basis, plus probation for 3 years on specified conditions. 
</p>
<p>[2] The sentencing judge rejected the joint submission having regard to the 
  relevant principles of law in respect of joint submissions and imposed a sentence 
  of one year in addition to pre-trial custody, plus probation for two years instead 
  of the proposed term of three years. It is our view that, while the sentencing 
  judge adverted to the governing principles, he erred in their application. The 
  joint submission was not unreasonable or one that would bring the administration 
  of justice into disrepute. That is perhaps best exemplified by the quantum ultimately 
  imposed in this case.</p>
<p> [3] Leave to appeal is allowed, the appeal is allowed, the sentence is varied 
  to one of 12 months, less credit of 172 days (86 days of pre-trial custody x 
  2), plus probation for 3 years on conditions as imposed by the sentencing judge.</p>
<p> [4] In addition, there will be a condition that the appellant abstain from 
  the consumption of alcohol. This latter condition was agreed upon as part of 
  the joint submission but was not made part of the sentencing. </p>
<p>[5] The DNA order (complied with) and the s. 109 prohibition order are confirmed.</p>
