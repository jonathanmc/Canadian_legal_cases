<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We would admit the fresh evidence. In our view, it was not reasonably available 
  on March 1, 2004 given that counsel was only retained on February 23, 2004 and 
  it could reasonably have impacted on the motion judge's determination in the 
  sense that it was credible and reliable and tended to confirm the appellant's 
  explanation for his delay.</p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, for that reason alone, we are of the view that the appeal 
  must succeed and the noting in default should be set aside on such terms as 
  are just (see rule 19.03(1)).</p>
<p>[3] In the particular circumstances of this case, given that the appellant 
  has, for all intents and purposes, admitted liability, we would set aside the 
  noting in default on the following terms:</p>
<p>(1) The appellant may deliver a statement of defence by no later than June 
  11, 2004, limited to the issue of damages.</p>
<p>(2) Discoveries on the issue of damages are to be completed by June 17, 2004.</p>
<p>(3) All necessary steps shall be taken to expedite the transcripts, if any, 
  such that they will be available for the trial presently scheduled for June 
  21, 2004.</p>
<p>[4] With respect to costs, the motions judge made no order as to costs. We 
  would not interfere with that disposition.</p>
<p>[5] As for the appeal, the appellant concedes that he should pay the reasonable 
  costs of the respondents. We agree. In our view, costs should be awarded on 
  a partial indemnity basis. Given that the appellant was successful, at least 
  in part, and given the nature and complexity of the appeal and the awards normally 
  made by this court in similar cases, we would fix the costs at $7,500 inclusive 
  of GST and disbursements.</p>
