<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The only notice of appeal in existence was served and filed before the 
  motion judge released his decision with respect to the &quot;Crown&quot; defendants. 
  He dismissed the claim against the other defendant. This document could not 
  constitute a notice of appeal as against the Crown defendants, even though it 
  referred to all of the defendants, including the Crown defendants.</p>
<p>[2] No steps have been taken to remedy this deficiency in almost two years 
  despite timely notice by the Crown that it would take the position that there 
  is no appeal against the Crown in existence.</p>
<p>[3] No material has been filed that would justify an extension of the time 
  to file a proper notice of appeal. In any event, we heard full argument on the 
  merit of the appeal and are satisfied there is no merit. Counsel abandoned any 
  argument against the disposition as it related to Raftery. We agree with the 
  motion judge that the appellant's submissions as against the other Crown defendants 
  cannot prevail in the light of s. 7(1) of the Proceedings Against the Crown 
  Act. Consequently, even if we were inclined to relieve against the failure to 
  file a valid notice of appeal, we would not do so as the appeal has no merit. 
  It is not in the interests of justice to extend the time.</p>
<p>[4] We have received the Crown's submissions on costs. In these circumstances, 
  we are satisfied that there should be no order as to costs.</p>
