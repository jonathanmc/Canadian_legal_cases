<p class="boldcenter">APPEAL BOOK ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is a motion for review of the order of Abella J.A. Many of the applicants' 
  arguments were directed at the merits of the underlying dispute. We have no 
  power to address the merits on this motion. We also have no jurisdiction to 
  grant most of the remedies sought by the applicants (e.g. reinstatement). </p>
<p>[2] Leave to appeal is required: s. 6(1)(a) of the Courts of Justice Act (C.J.A.). 
  No motion for leave to appeal has been brought. Section 134(2) of the C.J.A. 
  would appear to preclude this motion absent a motion for leave to appeal.</p>
<p>[3] In any event, even if we had jurisdiction to grant any of the relief requested, 
  the applicants have not established any ground for granting any of the relief.</p>
<p>[4] We also reject the applicants' claim that the Union of the Ontario Labour 
  Relations Board have some obligation to provide counsel to represent the applicants 
  in this court.</p>
<p>[5] Motion dismissed. No costs.</p>
