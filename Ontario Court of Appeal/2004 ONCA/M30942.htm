<p>On motion to quash the appeal from the judgment of Justice John D. Ground of 
  the Superior Court of Justice dated October 28, 2003.</p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. Introduction</p>
<p>
  [1] The issue on this motion to quash is whether Amaranth L.L.C.'s appeal lies 
  to this court or to the Divisional Court. </p>
<p>
  [2] Amaranth held debentures issued by Counsel Corporation under a trust indenture. 
  When Counsel sought to exercise an option under the indenture to convert the 
  debentures to common shares, Amaranth applied for relief under the oppression 
  remedy provisions of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  B.16 ("OBCA").</p>
<p>
  [3] Ground J. dismissed the application. He held that because the trust indenture 
  permitted only the trustee to take legal proceedings, Amaranth had no standing 
  to sue. Amaranth appealed to this court, and to protect its position, also to 
  the Divisional Court. Counsel, the moving party on this motion, contends that 
  Amaranth's appeal lies to the Divisional Court. It relies on s. 255 of the OBCA, 
  which provides: "An appeal lies to the Divisional Court from any order 
  made by the court under this Act." Amaranth contends that its appeal lies 
  to this court. It relies on the basis on which Gound J. dismissed its application: 
  the interpretation of a contract, not the exercise of a power under the OBCA. 
  </p>
<p>
  [4] I would resolve this debate in favour of the moving party. In my view, Amaranth's 
  appeal should go to the Divisional Court. </p>
<p>
  B. Discussion</p>
<p>
  [5] The proceeding before Ground J. arose when Counsel gave notice that it intended 
  to exercise its option to convert its debentures to common shares. Amaranth 
  applied under s. 248 of the OBCA for an injunction to prevent the conversion 
  and for a declaration that the notice was ineffective. On the return of the 
  application, Counsel brought a preliminary motion to determine whether Amaranth 
  had standing to sue. Ground J. concluded that an individual debenture-holder 
  had no standing to sue Counsel. He relied on two provisions of the trust indenture, 
  which provided that legal proceedings affecting the rights and remedies of a 
  debenture-holder had to be brought by the trustee on behalf of all of the debenture-holders. 
  Because he concluded that Amaranth had no standing to sue, he dismissed its 
  application for relief from oppression. </p>
<p>
  [6] The legislature has directed that appeals from orders under the OBCA lie 
  to the Divisional Court. This is evident from a reading of s. 6(1)(b) of the 
  Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 43 and s. 255 of the OBCA. Section 6(1)(b) 
  describes this court's jurisdiction to hear appeals from a final order of a 
  Superior Court judge: </p>
<p class="indent"> 6. (1) An appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) a final order of a judge of the Superior Court of Justice, 
  except an order referred to in clause 19(1)(a) or an order from which an appeal 
  lies to the Divisional Court under another Act [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  Section 255 of the OBCA invokes one of the exceptions in s. 6(1)(b) of the Courts 
  of Justice Act: </p>
<p class="indent">
  255. An appeal lies to the Divisional Court from any order made by the court 
  under this Act. </p>
<p>
  Court is defined in s. 1(1) of the OBCA to mean the Superior Court of Justice. 
  </p>
<p>
  [7] Ground J.'s order is a final order of a Superior Court judge. Because his 
  order dismissed Amaranth's application for relief under s. 248 of the OBCA, 
  on a plain reading of s. 255 of the OBCA, Amaranth's appeal lies to the Divisional 
  Court. Amaranth's appeal route does not change simply because Amaranth's right 
  to seek relief under s. 248 depended on the interpretation of the trust indenture. 
  Amaranth's standing to sue was not decided in a separate proceeding; it was 
  integral to its entitlement to relief under s. 248. Lacking standing, its claim 
  for relief under the OBCA could not succeed and its application under that Act 
  was dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [8] Amaranth makes two arguments in support of its position that its appeal 
  properly lies to this court. First, it argues that an appeal lies to the Divisional 
  Court only in respect of the exercise of a power under the OBCA. As its appeal 
  does not concern the exercise of a statutory power, but instead concerns a general 
  question of contract interpretation, Amaranth submits that this court has jurisdiction 
  to hear it. In support of this argument it relies on the decision of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in Kelvin Energy Ltd. v. Lee, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 235. Second, Amaranth 
  argues that in several cases similar to this one this court has assumed jurisdiction 
  to hear the appeal. I do not agree with either argument.</p>
<p>
  [9] The decision in Kelvin arose out of an application for an oppression remedy 
  under the Canada Business Corporations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44 ("CBCA"). 
  The parties negotiated a settlement, which, under the CBCA, had to be approved 
  by the court. The Director under the CBCA, who had been added as a party to 
  the proceedings, expressed concern about the settlement and obtained a court 
  order to examine two witnesses. That order was made under the Quebec Code of 
  Civil Procedure, R.S.Q., c. C-25, whose rules expressly apply in oppression 
  proceedings under the CBCA. The order for discovery was appealed and the Director 
  moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the order was not appealable as 
  of right. </p>
<p>
  [10] The CBCA contains an appeal provision, s. 249, almost identical to s. 255 
  of the OBCA. Thus, the Supreme Court had to decide whether the order for discovery 
  was an "order made by a court...under this Act". The Supreme Court 
  held that it was not. L'Heureux Dub&eacute; J. wrote at p. 258 that the scope 
  of s. 249 of the CBCA was limited "to those judgments arising from a power 
  specifically conferred by the Canada Business Corporations Act, to the exclusion 
  of the variety of interlocutory decisions made under the Code of Civil Procedure". 
  This result was driven by an important policy consideration: furthering the 
  statute's primary objective of giving a fast and effective remedy to shareholders 
  vulnerable to oppression, an objective that would be defeated were interlocutory 
  orders such as the one in issue appealable as of right. </p>
<p>
  [11] However, even accepting that Kelvin supports the proposition that s. 255 
  of the OBCA applies only to appeals from orders made under a power expressly 
  conferred by that statute, the order of Ground J. is such an order. Ground J. 
  dismissed Amaranth's application for relief from oppression. That dismissal 
  is an order made under a power expressly conferred by the OBCA, the power to 
  adjudicate on an application under s. 248. The reason for the dismissal - the 
  interpretation of the trust deed - does not deprive the Divisional Court of 
  jurisdiction to hear Amaranth's appeal. On applications under s. 248 the court 
  routinely interprets contractual terms. </p>
<p>
  [12] Ground J.'s interpretation of the trust indenture and his ruling on standing 
  were fundamental to his disposition of the application. His determination of 
  Amaranth's standing to sue was not an interlocutory order made under a different 
  statute along the way to dealing with the application for oppression, as was 
  the case in Kelvin. Indeed, it would be an anomalous result if the issue of 
  standing were to be hived off and appealable only to this court, while the underlying 
  merits of s. 248 proceedings were appealable to the Divisional Court. The legislature 
  could not have intended this result. As I view it, Kelvin does not assist Amaranth.</p>
<p>
  [13] Admittedly, in a few cases, this court has heard and decided appeals in 
  connection with proceedings under the OBCA: see for example Casurina Limited 
  Partnership v. Rio Algom Limited, [2004] O.J. No. 177 (C.A.); 1153238 Ontario 
  Ltd. v. Durbano, [2002] O.J. No. 1363 (C.A.); and Jabalee v. Abalmark Inc., 
  [1996] O.J. No. 2609 (C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [14] The case most directly on point is Casurina, also an application under 
  the oppression provisions of the OBCA. Like Ground J., the application judge 
  in that case, Spence J., held that the appellant, a debenture-holder, had no 
  standing to sue under the governing trust indenture. He therefore dismissed 
  the application for relief under s. 248 of the OBCA. He then went on, in obiter 
  observations, to address some of the merits of the s. 248 application. Feldman 
  J.A. wrote for the panel dismissing the appeal. She made no comment on this 
  court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [15] I do not view Casurina or the other cases cited by Amaranth to be helpful 
  in resolving this motion to quash. Whether for tactical or other reasons, in 
  none of these cases did counsel raise the question of this court's jurisdiction, 
  and therefore in none of them did this court consider whether it had jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  [16] In my view, Amaranth's appeal lies to the Divisional Court. I would grant 
  the motion to quash and transfer this proceeding to the Divisional Court. Counsel 
  is entitled to its costs of this motion, which I would fix at $3,500 inclusive 
  of disbursements and GST. </p>
