<p>[1] This is a motion brought by the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario ("ACTO") 
  seeking to intervene in this appeal as a friend of the court.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant, Tim Bakker and three friends, all students of the University 
  of Western Ontario, leased a house from the respondent. Eventually Mr. Bakker, 
  Mr. Crane and Mr. Klemos moved away leaving the fourth tenant, Mr. Holmes in 
  occupation of the home. At some point Mr. Holmes ceased to pay rent and ultimately 
  was found to be about $8.000.00 in arrears. The Landlord applied to the Ontario 
  Rental Housing Tribunal to recover these arrears as against the four individuals. 
  The Tribunal ruled that as Bakker, Crane and Kelmos were not tenants occupying 
  the rental unit at the time the application was filed, they were not liable 
  to pay the arrears of rent. The Tribunal made an order against Holmes, alone, 
  for the payment of the arrears. The Landlord appealed this decision to Divisional 
  Court, which held that as the premises had been leased by all four co-tenants, 
  occupation and possession by one co-tenant constituted occupation and possession 
  by all four tenants for the purposes of the Tenant Protection Act, 1997, S.O. 
  1997 c.24 . It held therefore that judgment for arrears should be granted against 
  all four tenants. Mr. Bakker, one of the successful "tenants" before 
  the Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal obtained leave to appeal the decision of 
  Divisional Court which had made him liable for arrears incurred after he had 
  vacated possession of the premises. </p>
<p>
  [3] ACTO is a clinic funded by Legal Aid Ontario whose mandate is to represent 
  low-income persons with housing and residential tenancy difficulties. It is 
  has been permitted to intervene as a friend of the court in both the Superior 
  Court of Justice and in this court. I am satisfied that ACTO has expertise in 
  dealing with issues arising from situations involving multiple tenants of residential 
  housing. </p>
<p>
  [4] The respondent Landlord opposed the intervention by ACTO on two bases. The 
  first is that Rule 13 of the Rules of Civil Procedure providing for intervention 
  does not apply to proceedings under the Tenant Protection Act, 1997. While it 
  is true that the provisions of the Tenant Protection Act, 1997 set out a detailed 
  procedure for proceedings before the Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal, the Act 
  does not articulate the procedure to be followed on appeal. Accordingly, the 
  Rules of Civil Procedure have application to appeals originating from the Tribunal. 
  Counsel for the respondent urged that Rule 61 of the Rules of Civil Procedure 
  provides a comprehensive and complete code of procedure for the conduct of appeals 
  in the Court of Appeal. He has submitted that as Rule 61 makes no provision 
  for intervention, such is not permitted. I do not accept this submission for 
  two reasons. The first is that Rule 61 does not, on its face, address or even 
  purport to address all procedural and substantive matters ancillary to the conduct 
  of an appeal. Secondly, other rules within the Rules of Civil Procedure do explicitly 
  deal with matters relevant to the conduct of appeals in the Court of Appeal. 
  In particular, and most importantly, Rule 13.03(2) explicitly provides for intervention 
  in the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, there is no basis for the submission that 
  the conduct of an appeal must be governed exclusively by and only by the provisions 
  of Rule 61. </p>
<p>
  [5] Counsel's second argument was that, on the basis of my decision in Authorson 
  (Litigation Guardian) et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (2001) 147 O.A.C. 
  355 intervention should be denied. As I pointed out in the Authorson case, intervention 
  in private litigation should be carefully scrutinized in order to ensure that 
  such intervention does not unnecessarily complicate the litigation or unduly 
  add to the expense to the parties. However, as articulated in that decision, 
  the private nature of a case, although an important factor, is only one of the 
  matters to be considered in determining whether intervention should be granted. 
  Also to be considered are the issues that arise and the likelihood that the 
  proposed intervenor can make a useful contribution to the resolution of the 
  appeal without causing injustice the immediate parties. See Authorson (Litigation 
  Guardian) et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, (supra); Childs v. Desormeaux 
  231 D.L.R. (4th) 311 and Peel (Regional Municipality) v. Great Atlantic &amp; 
  Pacific Co. (1990) 74 O.R. (2d) 164.</p>
<p>
  [6] In Authorson, although the litigation was substantially private in nature, 
  it did contain elements of public importance. However it was not because the 
  litigation was private in nature that the intervention was refused. Rather, 
  the proposed intervenor in that case, which had made valuable contributions 
  to the advancement of the interests of veterans in other forums, was not in 
  a position to demonstrate that it could contribute to the analysis of the rather 
  technical legal concepts of trusts and fiduciary duties that formed the core 
  issues of that appeal. </p>
<p>
  [7] That is not the case here and I am satisfied that although this litigation 
  is substantially private in nature it could well have a broader impact than 
  merely deciding the case between the two parties. The appeal may well determine 
  the nature of the relationship between co-tenants, between co-tenants and landlords 
  and the effect of the departure of a co-tenant with respect to these relationships. 
  From its expertise in dealing with difficulties arising out of the wide variety 
  of factual situations giving rise to disputes between co-tenants and between 
  tenants and landlords, ACTO will be able to bring to bear an analysis of the 
  issues in this appeal from a perspective that is different from that of the 
  individual tenant/appellant in this case. ACTO could assist the court in understanding 
  the dimensions of the legal issues that arise in this case. </p>
<p>
  [8] I also recognize the private nature of this litigation and the need to avoid 
  unnecessarily complicating issues before the court, or unduly adding to the 
  costs to the respondent. The proposed intervenor will therefore not be permitted 
  to add to the record and will be potentially subject to an adverse costs award 
  should the court hearing the appeal determine such is appropriate.</p>
<p>
  [9] Accordingly I grant leave to ACTO to intervene as a friend of the court 
  of the following conditions: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) It take the record as it is and it will not be permitted 
  to adduce further material; </p>
<p class="indent">(b) That it will not seek costs on the appeal but that costs 
  may be awarded against it;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) That it deliver its factum, not to exceed 15 pages in length 
  on or before March 10th, 2004;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) That the respondent may deliver a supplementary factum, 
  if necessary, to respond to matters raised by the intervenor no later than March 
  22nd, 2004'</p>
<p class="indent">(e) That the time allocated for its oral submission be fixed 
  at 20 minutes. </p>
<p> There will be no costs of this motion.</p>
