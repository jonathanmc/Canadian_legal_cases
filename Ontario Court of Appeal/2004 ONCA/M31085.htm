<p>SHARPE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The Attorney General for Ontario moves for a stay of an order requiring 
  the production in a civil action of a videotape statement given by the plaintiff 
  to the police for use in criminal proceedings. </p>
<p>
  [2] The stay motion arises in the following context. The plaintiff and others 
  have made allegations of sexual assault against Douglas Brown, a teacher formerly 
  employed by the defendant school. Those allegations have led to criminal charges 
  against Brown and this civil action in which the plaintiff claims damages against 
  the defendant Upper Canada College, alleging negligence, breach of fiduciary 
  duty, vicarious liability and occupier's liability. </p>
<p>
  [3] Shortly after Brown's arrest in August 2001, the plaintiff gave the police 
  a videotaped statement that is the subject of this motion. The videotape formed 
  part of the Crown brief prepared with respect to the criminal charges against 
  Brown. The videotape has been produced to Brown in the criminal proceedings 
  as part of the Crown disclosure. The Crown initially agreed to produce the videotape, 
  but changed its position when a new Crown counsel took over the file. The plaintiff 
  consents to the production of the videotape in this action. </p>
<p>
  [4] The defendant moved for production of the videotape as a document in the 
  possession of a non-party to a civil action pursuant to rule 30.10. Master Albert 
  found that it would be unfair to require the defendant to proceed to trial without 
  the videotape and that the public interest in preserving the integrity of the 
  criminal proceedings could be met by imposing confidentiality safeguards as 
  conditions of the production order. On appeal to a single judge of the Divisional 
  Court, Lang J. agreed with both findings, but added to the confidentiality safeguards. 
  The result is that the videotape must be produced, but on the following conditions: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Only counsel for the parties to the civil action may receive 
  copies of the videotape and transcript;</p>
<p class="indent">2. Counsel may show the videotape to their clients (including 
  insurers) and may discuss the contents with them, but counsel shall ensure that 
  no copies are made for anyone;</p>
<p class="indent">3. Counsel and the parties are to take all reasonable steps 
  to ensure that potential witnesses in the criminal trial are not exposed to 
  the contents of the videotape, subject to any ruling the trial judge may make 
  with respect to admissibility and the imposition of any safeguards appropriate 
  to that context.</p>
<p>
  [5] The Attorney General has applied for leave to appeal to this court from 
  the judgment of the Divisional Court.</p>
<p>
  [6] The criminal trial, originally scheduled to begin in February 2004 is now 
  scheduled to proceed in September 2004. The civil action is scheduled to begin 
  on April 13, 2004, although the defendant has indicated that it will argue that 
  the confidentiality conditions are unduly restrictive and that the trial should 
  be adjourned to ensure that it can make full use of the videotape. The plaintiff 
  is most anxious to have the civil trial proceed at the earliest possible date.</p>
<p>
  [7] The Attorney General raises three grounds in its application for leave to 
  appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. That the master has no jurisdiction to order production 
  of documents generated in criminal proceedings for use in collateral civil proceedings 
  as such jurisdiction is reserved exclusively to judges of the Superior Court.</p>
<p class="indent">2. That production of documents generated in criminal proceedings 
  for use in collateral civil proceedings may only be ordered pursuant to the 
  screening mechanism established in P.(D.) v. Wagg (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 746 (Div. 
  Ct.) and that the Divisional Court erred in holding that the master was entitled 
  to order production pursuant to rule 30.10.</p>
<p class="indent">3. That the videotape is subject to litigation privilege. </p>
<p>
  [8] The Attorney General argues that these grounds of appeal constitute a serious 
  question to be tried, that production of the videotape would give rise to irreparable 
  harm, and that the balance of convenience favours granting the stay.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  1. Serious Question To Be Tried.</p>
<p>
  i. Jurisdiction of the Master</p>
<p>
  [9] The Attorney General relies on the following passage from paras 48-50 of 
  Wagg for the proposition that only a Superior Court judge can order production 
  from a Crown brief in an on-going criminal proceeding for the purposes of a 
  collateral civil action: </p>
<p class="indent"> The notion of the court reserving control over documentation 
  contained in the Crown Brief is consistent with, and supports, the court's general 
  jurisdiction to control its own process in order to protect the public interest 
  and ensure the proper administration of justice.&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">A superior court has original and plenary jurisdiction in all 
  civil and criminal matters including inherent jurisdiction to control and regulate 
  its process and to prevent this from being abused or obstructed&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">I am therefore satisfied that the court has the authority to 
  make the ruling and give the directions respecting the process that I propose.</p>
<p>
  [10] This statement must be read in context. Wagg dealt with a request for production 
  of a Crown brief that was in the possession of one of the parties as a result 
  of Crown disclosure. Under the Rules of Civil Procedure, there was no procedural 
  mechanism to put the Crown on notice and to afford the Crown an opportunity 
  to be heard on the issue. I agree with the respondent U.C.C.'s submission that 
  the quoted statements do not deal with exclusivity of jurisdiction, but rather 
  with the question of jurisdiction to create the screening mechanism. As the 
  present case involves production from the Crown as a non-party, rule 30.10 applies 
  and provides the required mechanism. Masters have jurisdiction to deal with 
  rule 30.10 motions and statutory courts have by necessary implication the power 
  to control their own process and the procedural tools to ensure the effective 
  and efficient disposition of matters falling within their competence: R. v. 
  Felderhof, [2003] O.J. No. 4819 (C.A.) at para 41; R. v. 974649 Ontario Ltd., 
  [2001] 3 S.C.R. 575 at para 38. Under rule 30.10, masters routinely weigh and 
  balance the public interest concerns of non-parties, including government agencies. 
  Masters also routinely make procedural orders arising under the rules that arguably 
  have a more significant impact upon criminal proceedings than the order sought 
  here: for example, ordering accused persons to be examined for discovery as 
  non-parties and staying civil proceedings pending the completion of related 
  criminal proceedings. In my view, the master and the Divisional Court correctly 
  dismissed the Attorney General's submission that the master lacked jurisdiction 
  and I see no merit in this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [11] Even if the Attorney General is correct and the master did not have jurisdiction 
  to entertain the motion, the matter has now been carefully reviewed by a Superior 
  Court judge who, indeed, did modify the confidentiality conditions on the production 
  order. No arguable point has been advanced to suggest that the Divisional Court 
  erred in its assessment of the public interest. In these circumstances, it seems 
  to me highly unlikely that leave to appeal would be granted. </p>
<p>
  ii. Application of Rule 30.10</p>
<p>
  [12] It would appear that to a significant extent, this point overlaps with 
  the argument relating to the jurisdiction of the master. Putting the jurisdiction 
  argument to one side, I see nothing in rule 30.10 that is inconsistent or incompatible 
  with the screening mechanism contemplated by Wagg. In my view, Lang J. correctly 
  concluded that in the context of a request for production of material from a 
  Crown brief, the fairness test under rule 30.10 &quot;encompasses balancing 
  consideration of the needs of the moving party for access to the particular 
  material against the interests of a third party, the interests of the public 
  in protecting the material from disclosure, and any other relevant interests.&quot; 
  The reasons of both the master and the Divisional Court, as well as the conditions 
  they imposed upon production, demonstrate that they both fully considered the 
  public interest arguments identified in Wagg under the regime of rule 30.10. 
  Accordingly, I conclude that this ground of appeal does not meet the &quot;serious 
  issue to be tried&quot; test. </p>
<p>
  iii. Litigation Privilege</p>
<p>
  [13] In my view, the Divisional Court correctly concluded that litigation privilege 
  does not apply in the circumstances of this case. The Attorney General does 
  not suggest that the videotape is protected by solicitor-client privilege. Litigation 
  privilege may attach to some materials prepared by the police for the purpose 
  of a criminal trial, but I fail to see any basis for its application in the 
  circumstances of this case. The purpose of litigation privilege, as distinct 
  from solicitor-client privilege, is to protect work product in the adversarial 
  litigation process: see Ontario (Attorney General) v. Ontario (Information and 
  Privacy Commission, Inquiry Officer) (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 167 (C.A.). It follows 
  that production to the opposite party in the litigation effectively ends the 
  privilege. The videotape has already been produced to the accused in the criminal 
  proceedings and hence in that litigation, privilege no longer attaches to the 
  videotape. Litigation privilege, unlike solicitor-client privilege, does not 
  survive the litigation in which it arose, although legislation may extend broader 
  protection to material prepared for the purposes of litigation: Ontario (Attorney 
  General) v. Ontario (Information and Privacy Commission, Inquiry Officer). </p>
<p>
  [14] At this stage, any interest the Attorney General may assert to refuse production 
  does not arise from litigation privilege but rather under the heading of the 
  public interest identified in Wagg. As I have already stated, those concerns 
  were fully and fairly considered by the master and the Divisional Court. </p>
<p>
  Serious Question to be Tried - Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [15] While I am mindful that the threshold is low, I consider it so unlikely 
  that leave to appeal will be granted in this case that I am prepared to conclude 
  that the Attorney General has failed to satisfy this first branch of the test 
  for a stay. I see no merit in the only substantive ground of appeal (privilege) 
  and the remaining two grounds of appeal are entirely procedural in nature. The 
  Attorney General's submissions with respect to the jurisdiction of the master 
  and the application of rule 30.10 are not strong. Moreover, the Attorney General 
  has had the benefit of a comprehensive review by a Superior Court judge and 
  no arguable point has been advanced to suggest that the Divisional Court erred 
  in its assessment of that issue. In these circumstances, the leave to appeal 
  application appears to me to be doomed to almost certain failure. </p>
<p>
  2. Irreparable Harm </p>
<p>
  [16] The Attorney General contends that it will suffer irreparable harm if the 
  civil trial proceeds with the videotape in the hands of the defendant, as there 
  is a risk that witnesses in criminal proceedings could become &quot;tainted&quot; 
  if they were to learn what the plaintiff told the police in the videotape. I 
  find this submission to be without merit. First, the risk of &quot;tainting&quot; 
  witnesses is met by the strict confidentiality conditions imposed by the master 
  and the Divisional Court. Second, this motion deals only with production of 
  the videotape, not its use at trial, and so the fears raised by the Attorney 
  General are entirely speculative. If and when the defendant seeks to make use 
  of the videotape during the trial, it would be open to the trial judge to impose 
  conditions to shield the videotape from eyes that should not see it, if indeed 
  that is required. Third, even if we were to focus on the use of the videotape 
  at trial, any risk of tainting from the videotape seems to me to be remote, 
  if not non-existent. If there is a risk of tainting, it surely stems from the 
  fact that the plaintiff will testify, not from production of the videotape. 
  The videotape may enter the trial if the plaintiff is cross-examined on any 
  inconsistent statements, but any added tainting that would flow from revealing 
  such contradictions seems to me to be very remote. </p>
<p>
  [17] If there was any merit to the Attorney General's argument that the videotape 
  is protected by privilege, it would be arguable that requiring production before 
  the determination of the criminal proceeding could give rise to irreparable 
  harm. However, as I view the privilege claim to be without merit, I find no 
  irreparable harm on that count. </p>
<p>
  3. Balance of Convenience</p>
<p>
  [18] In my view, the balance of convenience strongly favours denying the stay. 
  There have been concurrent findings by the master and by the Divisional Court 
  that it would be unfair to require the defendant to proceed to trial without 
  production of the videotape. The likely effect of a stay will be to force the 
  trial court to decide whether to proceed without production of the videotape, 
  or adjourn the trial until after the Attorney General's proposed appeal has 
  run its course or until after the completion of the criminal trial. If the civil 
  trial proceeds before the criminal trial, the defendant will suffer prejudice. 
  If the defendant is granted an adjournment of the civil trial because the videotape 
  has not been produced, the plaintiff will suffer the prejudice of delay. In 
  my view, the harm that would be suffered by the parties in the civil action 
  clearly outweighs any harm that might be suffered by the Attorney General and 
  its interest in a fair criminal trial by reason of the production of the videotape. 
  The rights of the parties to fair and expeditious justice should prevail.</p>
<p>
  [19] The Attorney General submits that denial of the stay may render its appeal 
  moot. Given my assessment of the merits of the proposed appeal, I do not regard 
  that possibility as having any weight on the balance of convenience. </p>
<p>
  [20] I hardly need to add that if I am wrong in my assessment of the merits 
  of the proposed appeal, and three of my colleagues conclude that the Attorney 
  General does raise points deserving the consideration of this court, they clearly 
  have the discretion to grant leave to appeal even where the appeal has become 
  moot. </p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [21] Accordingly, the motion for a stay is dismissed. The respondents are entitled 
  to their costs of the motion fixed at $2,500 to each party, inclusive of GST 
  and disbursements.</p>
<p>
  [22] As an addendum, I note that Exhibit 3 to the supplementary affidavit of 
  Thomas Ward contains a copy of the information in the criminal proceedings revealing 
  the names of the complainants, that affidavit shall be sealed and the plaintiff 
  is directed to file for the public record another copy of the affidavit with 
  those names deleted.</p>
