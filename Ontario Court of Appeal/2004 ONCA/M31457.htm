  <h2><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h2>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
    <span
lang=EN-US>This is a review of the decision of the extradition/bail judge ordering 
    Thi Phuong Mai&nbsp;Le’s (“Mai Le”) release pending determination of allegations 
    that she has been involved in extensive drug-related activities, including 
    sophisticated international money laundering.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>It is agreed that, to succeed, the applicant must demonstrate that 
    the judge made an error in principle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I 
    see no such error.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
    <span
lang=EN-US>The extradition/bail judge carefully and fairly reviewed the seriousness 
    of the allegations against Mai&nbsp;Le.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>He was entitled to conclude, and did conclude, that the allegations 
    against her did not include allegations that she participated in violent activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Indeed, the judge particularly noted that Mai&nbsp;Le discouraged violence. 
    Although violence was alleged against others in the organization, they were 
    not connected to Mai&nbsp;Le.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
    <span
lang=EN-US>In considering the grounds required for Mai&nbsp;Le’s release, the 
    judge gave particular attention to the primary ground.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In doing so, he was fully cognizant of the 
    particular considerations at play in drug trafficking cases and the marked 
    danger that an accused so charged will abscond.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>With the factors in <i>R. v. Pearson </i>(1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 
    124 (S.C.C.) in mind, he carefully crafted terms of release that would minimize 
    the risk of flight during the four to five years it will take before these 
    allegations are determined.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The detailed 
    terms of release satisfied the judge that Mai&nbsp;Le was not a significant 
    flight risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She proposed sureties 
    whom the judge found to be impressive and who were prepared to put virtually 
    all their assets on the line to demonstrate their confidence in their ability 
    to supervise Mai&nbsp;Le.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
    <span
lang=EN-US>As I read the judge’s reasons – and my interpretation is confirmed 
    by counsel for the respondent – while Mai&nbsp;Le is on release she would, 
    at all times, be under the supervision of one surety while in the house.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When not in the house, for the purpose of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>attending medical and legal appointments, she would be accompanied 
    by, and under the supervision of, two sureties.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
    <span
lang=EN-US>As part of the plan to prevent flight, the judge heard evidence about 
    the suggested further safeguard of electronic monitoring, which it was proposed 
    would be undertaken by the private company that provides such services for 
    the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services in relation to 
    probation and the Temporary Absence Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The judge adjourned the hearing to garner more information about the 
    proposed electronic monitoring and to ensure its suitability.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>After comprehensive consideration, and in the particular circumstances 
    of this case, the judge was satisfied with the plan in its entirety, including 
    the electronic monitoring component.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
    <span
lang=EN-US>With respect to the particulars of electronic monitoring, questions 
    arose as to how the Ottawa Police Service would respond to a call from the 
    monitoring station indicating the possibility that Mai&nbsp;Le had left her 
    area of confinement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Counsel for the 
    respondent concedes, and I agree, that an extradition/bail judge does not 
    have jurisdiction to order the local police force to respond to such a call 
    in a particular manner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Indeed, the 
    terms before me this morning do not order any particular response by the Ottawa 
    Police Service and, for clarity, the judge himself had suggested the addition 
    of the words “at [the police] option”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While 
    in the process of gathering information, the judge required the Ottawa Police 
    Service to engage in a discussion with the surveillance company to resolve 
    these issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With the benefit of 
    hindsight, that might have been accomplished by simply calling evidence of 
    how the police would respond to a call from the monitoring station.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As I am advised by counsel, this would likely 
    be similar to the response to a call received from a surety.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
    <span
lang=EN-US>In the result, I do not accept that the judge exceeded his jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>To ensure that there is no misunderstanding in this regard, the terms 
    of the release should not require the Ottawa Police Service to take any specific 
    action upon receipt of a call from the monitoring station.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>It is sufficient that the police have given evidence that they would 
    respond to it as a “Priority 2” call.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As 
    such, the police would attend at the house within fifteen minutes to two hours, 
    after receiving the alert, depending on the circumstances then prevailing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The judge was satisfied that such a response 
    would appropriately minimize the risk of flight.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Of course, if the electronic monitoring, which is indeed novel for 
    this purpose, posed practical problems in implementation for the Ottawa Police 
    Service, such problems could be addressed by bringing them to the court’s 
    attention for resolution or reconsideration.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
    <span
lang=EN-US>I do not see the use of electronic monitoring as analogous to the U.S. 
    bail bondsman system or giving rise to the limitations inherent in that system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The sureties retain primary responsibility for Mai&nbsp;Le.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Electronic monitoring is merely a means of taking advantage of modern 
    technology to implement maximum safeguards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Nor do I see the judge’s order – as suggested by the Crown – as delegating 
    risk assessments to a private company or to the local police service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The judge has made the appropriate risk assessment himself and has 
    set out his reasons for concluding that the risk of flight, given the parameters 
    of the terms of release, is acceptable.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
    <span
lang=EN-US>Further, I do not accept that the release order favours a “rich” accused, 
    who would be released, while a “poor” accused would be detained.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The cost of electronic monitoring is relatively 
    modest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Further, monetary security 
    is an accepted part of decisions about judicial interim release, particularly 
    with regard to sureties.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Despite the submissions of the appellant, 
    it is my view that the judge also considered the secondary and tertiary grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>That is evident from the transcript and from the conditions of release 
    that he imposed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Out of further caution, I would add an additional 
    term precluding Mai&nbsp;Le from accessing the Internet.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, this review is dismissed, 
    subject to the minor modifications made to the terms of release with the input 
    from counsel at the conclusion of this review, and also subject to any further 
    fine tuning of those terms, which is left to the extradition/bail judge.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For clarity, a copy of the terms of release 
    is annexed.</span></p>
