<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>
  [1] This action arose out of a dispute between family members over the will 
  and the assets of the deceased Dora Herberman. The dispute was resolved by trial 
  before Carnwath J., resulting in a judgment dated January 17, 2002. The appellant, 
  Jeffrey Streisfield appeals from that judgment. The respondents cross-appeal 
  on one discrete issue. The trial judge's comprehensive findings of fact are 
  not in dispute. They are set out fully in the trial judgment, reported at (2001), 
  40 E.T.R. (2d) 98. In order to dispose of the issues before this court, it is 
  only necessary to refer to some of the facts. </p>
<p>
  [2] Dora Herberman died in July 1993 at the age of 91. On March 30, 1990, Herberman 
  executed a will. Under its terms, the plaintiff Gerald Streisfield (now deceased) 
  and the defendant Marvin Goodman were appointed executors of the estate, and 
  members of the Streisfield family were residuary legatees. Marvin Goodman renounced 
  his position as executor in November 1994. </p>
<p>
  [3] In May 1996, the Streisfield family brought an action to have Herberman's 
  1990 will declared valid. The defendants contested the validity of the 1990 
  will and counterclaimed to have Herberman's earlier will, dated January 6, 1977, 
  declared valid. Under that will, other persons who are not parties to this action 
  were named as executors and the respondent Jean Karnovsky was one of the residuary 
  legatees. The respondents also counterclaimed for a return to the estate of 
  assets they alleged had been wrongfully taken from the deceased by members of 
  the Streisfield family. </p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge found that a conspiracy existed among Gerald Streisfield, 
  his wife Lillian, and their two children, Craig and Jeffrey, to defraud Herberman 
  of her money and her house. In furtherance of this conspiracy and by the exercise 
  of undue influence, members of the Streisfield family obtained from the elderly 
  Herberman a transfer of her house to Lillian Streisfield; a power of attorney 
  appointing Craig Streisfield as attorney; a transfer of over $300,000 in various 
  cheques payable to members of the Streisfield family; and the 1990 will that 
  benefited the Streisfields to the detriment of the beneficiaries in the earlier 
  will. </p>
<p>
  [5] As a result of those findings, the trial judge dismissed the action to declare 
  the 1990 will valid and declared the 1977 will as Herberman's last will and 
  testament. The trial judge also set aside the transfer of the house to Lillian 
  Streisfield and ordered that the interest in the property be vested in the estate; 
  he held the appellant Jeffrey Streisfield liable, jointly and severally with 
  other members of his family, for the repayment of monies wrongfully obtained 
  from Herberman; and he ordered the Estate of Gerald Streisfield and Lillian 
  Streisfield to pay to the estate occupation rent with respect to Herberman's 
  house. </p>
<p>
  [6] Jeffrey Streisfield appeals from the finding of liability to pay to the 
  estate of Dora Herberman the sum of $325,154.10 plus prejudgment interest and 
  costs on a solicitor and client scale. The respondents cross-appeal from the 
  dismissal of their counterclaim for occupation rent as against Jeffrey Streisfield. 
  </p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant essentially raises two arguments on appeal. First, he argues 
  that the respondents did not have standing to bring a counterclaim for the return 
  of the deceased's assets and for occupation rent. Second, he submits that the 
  trial judge erred in finding him liable in the absence of any causal connection 
  between his actions and the loss to the estate. </p>
<p>
  [8] On the cross-appeal, the respondents argue that the quantum of the judgment 
  should be increased to reflect the loss in occupation rent caused by the taking 
  of the deceased's house. They submit that the trial judge erred in refusing 
  to make this order as against Jeffrey Streisfield on the basis that he had moved 
  out of the house before the relevant time period. They contend that the appellant's 
  knowing participation in the unlawful scheme to divest the deceased of her assets 
  was sufficient to ground a finding of liability for occupation rent.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [9] With respect to the first ground of appeal, the appellant seeks to rely 
  on s. 38 of the Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.23. He submits that the respondents 
  did not have standing to bring their counterclaim because under that provision, 
  only an executor or administrator of a person's estate may maintain an action 
  for tort or injury to the person or property of a deceased person. He also submits 
  that s. 38(3) provides that any such action must be brought within two years 
  from the death of the deceased. Hence, even if the counterclaim had been brought 
  by the proper party, he argues that it was prescribed because it was commenced 
  after the two year limitation period had expired. </p>
<p>
  [10] We are not prepared to entertain the appellant's argument on the first 
  ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  [11] First, although the question of standing was pleaded, it was never raised 
  at trial, and perhaps understandably so. On the face of the existing record, 
  there is no reason to believe that the proper parties were not before the court. 
  It is noteworthy that both executors named under the impugned 1990 will were 
  parties to the action, although one had renounced his position sometime before 
  the action was commenced. More importantly, the parties to the action were determined 
  by order of Greer J. on a motion for directions brought on March 7, 1996, just 
  prior to the commencement of the action in May 1996. The parties to the action 
  include the Public Guardian and Trustee and Leonard Weinstein in his capacity 
  as Estate Trustee During Litigation. Finally, the counterclaim, in its substance, 
  was brought solely on behalf of Herberman's estate. In these circumstances, 
  we are not prepared to give effect to the standing argument for the first time 
  on appeal. </p>
<p>
  [12] Second, on the question of the expiry of the limitation period, this affirmative 
  defence was not even pleaded. It is well established that a limitation period 
  must be raised as an affirmative defence at the pleadings stage: see rule 25.07(4) 
  and, for a recent decision of this court, Strong v. M.M.P. (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 
  70 (C.A.). Again, we are not prepared to give effect to this argument for the 
  first time on appeal.</p>
<p>
  [13] With respect to the second ground of appeal, the appellant argues that 
  there was no causal connection between his actions and any loss to the estate 
  and that, further, he did not receive any of Herberman's assets. In the circumstances, 
  he submits that the trial judge's finding of liability against him has no basis 
  in law. </p>
<p>
  [14] We do not agree. The basis of the trial judge's decision is that Jeffrey 
  Streisfield knowingly assisted in Gerald and Craig Streisfield's breach of fiduciary 
  duty to Herberman. Jeffrey Streisfield knew all the circumstances from which 
  they had a fiduciary duty. Jeffrey prepared the power of attorney designating 
  Craig as attorney. He took the power of attorney to Herberman knowing that Herberman 
  trusted him as the family lawyer and that she was incompetent. He used Herberman's 
  trust in him to procure her signature. Once the power of attorney was signed 
  it was taken to the bank and the bank disclosed that Herberman had approximately 
  $250,000. The other Streisfields used that information to get the benefit of 
  that money. Jeffrey Streisfield commissioned Herberman's signature on the Land 
  Transfer Tax affidavit when the Torresdale property was transferred to his mother 
  Lillian. These are but examples of his knowing assistance. There is no basis 
  for interfering with the trial judge's holding that Jeffrey's actions facilitated 
  Gerald and Craig's breach of fiduciary duty. There was a causal connection between 
  the breach of fiduciary duty and the damage that occurred. </p>
<p>
  [15] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [16] On cross-appeal, the respondents submit that, because Jeffrey knowingly 
  assisted in Herberman's loss of the house, he should also be liable for the 
  occupation rent. </p>
<p>
  [17] Although this position is arguable at law, we would not give effect to 
  it. Based on the findings of fact concerning the nature and extent of participation 
  by Jeffrey Streisfield, it is our view that it was within the trial judge's 
  purview to limit the scope of his liability to the repayment of monies wrongfully 
  obtained from Herberman and to decline to order the payment of occupation rent. 
  We would not interfere with the exercise of that discretion. Consequently, the 
  cross-appeal is dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [18] The respondents are entitled to their costs, fixed in the amount of $17,500 
  inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
