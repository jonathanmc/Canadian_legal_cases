<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was charged with sexual assault, touching for a sexual purpose 
  a person under 14 years of age, and invitation to touch for a sexual purpose 
  a person under 14 years of age. All three counts involved the same complainant. 
  After a trial by judge and jury, the appellant was convicted on all three counts. 
  </p>
<p>
  [2] He appeals his conviction, saying that the trial judge improperly curtailed 
  his counsel's cross-examination of the complainant and his mother. The focus 
  of the appellant's submissions was on the cross-examination of the complainant 
  at the point where his counsel (not Mr. Lomer) sought to question the complainant 
  about a porn movie which he had in his possession. Counsel asked who it belonged 
  to. The complainant answered that he believed it belonged to the appellant A. 
  C. Counsel briefly pursued this, to the point where the complainant was speculating 
  that the porn movie was stolen or taken from Mr. C.'s house. At that point, 
  the trial judge indicated that this was not relevant and stopped the line of 
  questioning. Counsel moved on and did not attempt to return to the subject of 
  the porn movie.</p>
<p>
  [3] At the conclusion of her cross-examination of the complainant, defence counsel 
  confirmed her view that the trial judge's ruling was about precluding questions 
  concerning "returning a porno movie". Perhaps because of this view, 
  counsel at no time sought to cross-examine the complainant or his mother about 
  how the porn movie got to the appellant's house. Certainly her submissions following 
  the charge made it clear that she had taken this meaning from the ruling.</p>
<p>
  [4] Before us, the appellant argued that the ruling was to this effect and that, 
  as a result, the appellant was prevented from eliciting evidence from the complainant 
  or his mother to strengthen the credibility of his own evidence that the complainant's 
  mother sent the porn movie over to the appellant's house with the complainant. 
  In his charge, the trial judge flagged this evidence of the appellant for the 
  jury as something to consider in evaluating his credibility, because of its 
  arguable improbability.</p>
<p>
  [5] In our view, the trial judge's ruling cannot reasonably be taken to mean 
  what the appellant argues. The trial judge simply prevented counsel from exploring 
  where the porn movie came from, not how it might have got from the complainant's 
  house to the appellant's house. The source of the porn movie was indeed irrelevant 
  to the trial. The fact that the ruling may have been misunderstood cannot turn 
  a relatively straightforward ruling into an error in the conduct of the trial.</p>
<p>
  [6] Since counsel did not pursue the question with the complainant or his mother, 
  the trial judge had only the appellant's evidence on how the porn movie got 
  to the appellant's house. The trial judge was entitled to comment on this evidence 
  in his charge as he did. His comments concerning this aspect of the appellant's 
  evidence did not mislead the jury.</p>
<p>
  [7] This ground of appeal therefore fails.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant also addressed several other interventions by the trial judge 
  but only very briefly. In our view, none of these intervention goes beyond an 
  attempt to clarify the evidence. They do not constitute improper interventions 
  by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appeal must be dismissed.</p>
