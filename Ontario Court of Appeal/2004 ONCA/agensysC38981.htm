<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Edward F. Then of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 27, 2002.</p>
<p>GILLESE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Revenue Canada obtained search warrants for business and residential premises 
  in which the appellants had privacy interests. The appellants applied to have 
  the search warrants quashed. Justice Then dismissed the application. The appellants 
  appeal from that dismissal. </p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent moves to have the appeal quashed on the basis that it is 
  moot. All of the seized items were returned to the parties from whom they were 
  seized in 1998 and no charges were laid as a consequence of the investigation 
  and seizures. As a result, the respondent argues, the appellants no longer require 
  any remedy, the dispute is over and the appeal is moot.</p>
<p>
  [3] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both the motion to quash and 
  the appeal.</p>
<p>
  Background in Brief</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellants were the subjects of a Revenue Canada investigation into 
  alleged offences under the Income Tax Act and the Criminal Code, including the 
  offences of claiming fraudulent limited partnership losses and deductions, and 
  selling fraudulent losses to investors. </p>
<p>
  [5] The investors incurred losses through investments in several limited partnerships 
  formed between 1992 and 1995. The limited partnerships had acquired territorial 
  rights to computer software known as the "Agensys software" from Agensys 
  Corporation, a company incorporated in the Turks and Caicos. In 1996, the corporate 
  appellant acquired the rights to the software from the various limited partnerships. 
  The Agensys software was described as "an automated tool used to support 
  information management".</p>
<p>
  [6] The theory of the Revenue Canada investigators was that the limited partnership 
  losses were illegitimate because the software was worthless. In furtherance 
  of the investigation, Mark Duncan, a Revenue Canada officer with the Special 
  Investigations Unit, swore an Information to Obtain. </p>
<p>
  [7] In the Information to Obtain, Mr. Duncan referred to three sources of information 
  concerning the value of the Agensys software. First, in June 1993, R. J. Pritchard 
  &amp; Associates made an evaluation of the fair market value of the software 
  in Canada as of May 31, 1993, concluding that it was approximately $14,875,000.00. 
  The Pritchard valuation projected software sales for the years 1993 to 2001 
  of a total of $53,773,000 - this too was shown in the Information to Obtain.</p>
<p>
  [8] Second, Mr. Duncan referred to a sales projection from a member of the Agensys 
  management group that was given to Fred Traer, a Revenue Canada officer with 
  the Tax Avoidance section, during a meeting on May 16, 1995. This projection 
  was that software sales for the years 1994 to 1998 would total $193,030,000.00. 
  </p>
<p>
  [9] Third, Mr. Duncan provided a chronological summary of meetings held, and 
  correspondence obtained, by Revenue Canada concerning the valuation of the software. 
  The chronology showed that on March 18, 1996, the Tax Avoidance section of Revenue 
  Canada received a letter from Murray Games of the Revenue Canada Valuations 
  section. The letter outlined the information that Mr. Games had received from 
  an outside consultant, Gondos &amp; Associates ("Gondos"). Revenue 
  Canada had hired Gondos in February 1995 to value the software. The Gondos information 
  included Gondo's opinion that the software, as of June 30, 1993, had no value 
  and the following six points: </p>
<p class="indent"> i) little or no material or effort appears to have been laid 
  out to develop or market the product. All the information, demonstrations, applications 
  and documentation that now exist appears to have been built or assembled for 
  the benefit of the Revenue Canada review, which was conducted some three years 
  after the date of valuation;</p>
<p class="indent">ii) the partnership did not provide evidence that they had access 
  or ownership of the source code;</p>
<p class="indent">iii) the partnership did not have a team of employees capable 
  of supporting, maintaining, updating, developing or marketing the product;</p>
<p class="indent">iv) the product that was demonstrated in 1996 was a DOS version 
  only, that even at those dates was not fully implemented and for which significant 
  parts did not exist;</p>
<p class="indent">v) the partnership had not developed any internal expertise 
  vis-&agrave;-vis the product and even today relies on external consultants. 
  In short, there was no continuity within the partnership to reflect the knowledge, 
  technical expertise and marketing skills necessary to successfully sell this 
  product;</p>
<p class="indent">vi) there were not any sales, and to date there still have not 
  been any sales of the software.</p>
<p>
  [10] Mr. Traer of the Tax Avoidance section, in turn, provided Mr. Duncan with 
  the Gondos information set out above.</p>
<p>
  [11] The Information to Obtain clearly outlined the means by which Mr. Duncan 
  came to know the Gondos valuation of the software. </p>
<p>
  [12] In the Information to Obtain, Mr. Duncan swore this, when referring to 
  the Gondos information: "[I]n trying to determine the nature and value 
  of the software acquired, the department received a valuation report that the 
  asset's value on June 30, 1993 based on the information seen was nil"[emphasis 
  added]. This was the only reference to a valuation report in the Information 
  to Obtain. Elsewhere in the document, the Gondos information is referred to 
  as statements or observations made by Gondos. </p>
<p>
  [13] On cross-examination, Mr. Duncan admitted that the term "valuation 
  report" was incorrect and that "valuation conclusion" would have 
  been a better term to have used. </p>
<p> [14] On October 7 and November 17, 1997, warrants were issued to search: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the business premises of the corporate appellant and associated limited 
    partnerships;</li>
  <li>the residences of the appellants Larry Gamble and David Morely<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a>; 
    and</li>
  <li>the law offices of Fasken Campbell Godfrey.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Pursuant to the warrants, investigators seized a large quantity of documents 
  and computerized data.</p>
<p> [15] Approximately six months after the warrants were executed, the appellants<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> 
  filed a court application in which they sought an order in the nature of certiorari 
  quashing the warrants and a declaration that their s. 8 Charter rights had been 
  violated.</p>
<p> [16] The record before the applications judge included: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the Information to Obtain;</li>
  <li>transcripts of the cross-examinations of Mr. Duncan on the Information to 
    Obtain;</li>
  <li>affidavits by the applicants;</li>
  <li>transcripts of the cross-examinations of the applicants on their affidavits; 
    and</li>
  <li>other materials pertinent to the value of the software and its commercial 
    viability.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [17] The applications judge concluded that, in terming the letter containing 
  the Gondos information a "valuation report", Mr. Duncan had misrepresented 
  the nature of the document relied upon. However, he also concluded that the 
  misrepresentation did not amount to deliberate deception. And, at para. 20 of 
  his reasons, he found that there was no misrepresentation of the content of 
  the Gondos information itself and that the warrant "would have been issued 
  on this document alone in light of the information it conveys." </p>
<p>
  [18] After dealing with the other matters raised by the appellants, he dismissed 
  the application.</p>
<p>
  [19] The appellants claim that the applications judge erred in finding that 
  there was some evidence before the issuing judge upon which the latter could 
  have issued the warrants. They submit that the record demonstrated that (1) 
  the issuing judge was misled by false, materially misleading and deliberately 
  deceptive statements in the Information to Obtain and (2) the affiant improperly 
  relied on hearsay evidence when swearing the Information to Obtain and, without 
  the hearsay evidence, probable cause for the issuance of the warrants would 
  not have been established. </p>
<p>
  The Motion to Quash</p>
<p>
  [20] An appeal is moot if a decision by the court will not resolve a live controversy 
  affecting, or potentially affecting, the rights of the parties. See Borowski 
  v. Canada (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342 at 353.</p>
<p>
  [21] The appellants have no further interest in these proceedings as the Revenue 
  Canada investigation is closed, all documents have been returned and no charges 
  have been laid. In the circumstances, I agree that the appeal is moot.</p>
<p>
  [22] As a general rule, a court will not hear a moot appeal. However, once it 
  is found that an appeal is moot, the court must determine whether it should 
  exercise its discretion to hear the case. The party seeking to have the appeal 
  determined on its merits bears the onus of convincing the court to make an exception 
  to the general rule: see Payne v. Wilson (2002), 162 O.A.C. 48 at 52.</p>
<p>
  [23] A court may exercise its discretion in favour of hearing a moot appeal 
  where the concerns underlying the general rule are outweighed by the interests 
  served by a determination of the merits of the appeal. Three concerns underlie 
  the general rule. First, mootness can diminish the adversarial process crucial 
  to the operation of the litigation process. Second, judicial resources are limited 
  and should normally be reserved for the determination of real disputes having 
  real consequences for the parties. Third, there is a concern that in deciding 
  moot appeals, the courts may step outside the boundaries of their proper adjudicative 
  role and intrude upon the role of the legislature: see Payne at p. 52 and Borowski 
  at pp. 358-63.</p>
<p>
  [24] A consideration of these factors leads me to conclude that it is in the 
  interests of justice to hear the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [25] The first concern does not arise here - there is an appropriate adversarial 
  context. Despite the cessation of a live controversy, the parties have vigorously 
  and fully argued the issues.</p>
<p>
  [26] The second concern, which relates to judicial economy, is diluted in the 
  circumstances of this case. The appellants filed their motion seeking to quash 
  the search warrants on April 24, 1998. In the fall of 1998, Revenue Canada investigators 
  closed their investigation and returned all the seized items to the parties 
  from whom they were seized. The parties continued to vigorously contest their 
  positions with interlocutory matters proceeding to cross-examination on both 
  sides. Final argument on the application was made on July 7, 2000, with each 
  party filing written submissions and authorities. The applications judge issued 
  his decision with reasons on September 27, 2002. The appellants filed a notice 
  of appeal on October 24, 2002. On June 2, 2003, the appellants filed multiple 
  copies of a six-volume set of appeal books and transcripts and on September 
  15, 2003, the appellants filed their factum. In December 2003, the respondent 
  raised the issue of mootness for the first time. No reasons were offered as 
  to why the mootness issue was raised for the first time on appeal or why the 
  Crown chose to vigorously contest the issues throughout the proceedings before 
  the applications judge.</p>
<p>
  [27] As the cases demonstrate, concerns about mootness are normally triggered 
  when there is a material change in the legal or factual substratum of the case 
  between the time of the decision and the time of the appeal from the decision. 
  See, for example, Borowski, supra, and Southam Inc. v. Canada (1990), 55 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 428 (Ont. C.A.). Here there was no change in the factual or legal substratum 
  of the case between the date of the decision and the time of the appeal. Moreover, 
  the effect of acceding to the mootness motion at this point would be to insulate 
  a favourable ruling from appellate review.</p>
<p>
  [28] The third concern - that the court would step beyond its judicial function 
  of resolving disputes - does not arise in the circumstances of this case. </p>
<p>
  [29] For these reasons, in my view, the court should exercise its discretion 
  and hear the appeal.</p>
<p>
  The Appeal</p>
<p>
  The Standard of Review</p>
<p>
  [30] The applicable standard of appellate review is clear. The court is to show 
  the usual deference for findings of fact and it ought not to interfere absent 
  an error of law, a misapprehension of the evidence or a failure to consider 
  relevant evidence: see R. v. Grant (1998), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 531 at 540 (Ont. 
  C.A.).</p>
<p>
  No error of law </p>
<p>
  [31] The applications judge thoroughly canvassed the relevant law and legal 
  principles. He quoted the following passage in R. v. Garofoli, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 
  1421 at 1452, in which the Supreme Court of Canada established the process by 
  which a reviewing judge was to consider the decision of the authorizing judge 
  to grant a search warrant: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The reviewing judge does not substitute his or her view for that of the authorizing 
  judge. If, based on the record which was before the authorizing judge as amplified 
  on the review, the reviewing judge concludes that the authorizing judge could 
  have granted the authorization, then he or she should not interfere. In this 
  process, the existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new 
  evidence are relevant, but, rather than being a prerequisite to review, their 
  sole impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the 
  decision of the authorizing judge.</p>
<p>
  [32] The applications judge noted that, as the reviewing judge, he had to expunge 
  any misleading and erroneous information and then make a determination as to 
  whether there was sufficient reliable information remaining that could support 
  the warrant. He referred to R. v. Monroe (1997), 8 C.R. (5th) 324 (B.C.C.A.) 
  in support of this point of law. See also R. v. Bisson (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 
  94 at 95-96 where the Supreme Court of Canada stated that errors in the information 
  presented to the authorizing judge, whether inadvertent or even fraudulent, 
  are factors to be considered in the review process but do not, by themselves, 
  lead to automatic vitiation of the search warrant. </p>
<p>
  [33] The penultimate paragraph in the applications judge's reasons for decision 
  is a clear enunciation of the correct legal principles. In that paragraph, he 
  stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  As the reviewing judge my function is to determine whether there is any basis 
  remaining, after disregarding the allegations that are false and taking into 
  consideration the facts found to have been omitted by the informant, upon which 
  the issuing judge would be satisfied that a search warrant should be issued. 
  In my view, the issuing judge in this case could be satisfied that the search 
  warrants should be issued. </p>
<p>
  The alleged errors</p>
<p>
  [34] The appellants concede that the applications judge correctly articulated 
  the governing legal principles but argue that he erred in their application. 
  The primary errors alleged are: (1) a failure to conclude that the main allegation 
  in the Information to Obtain - the allegation that a valuation report showed 
  the software was of no value - was a deliberate and substantial deception sufficient 
  to vitiate the warrants; and, (2) a failure to find that Mr. Duncan's approach 
  to the drafting of the Information to Obtain was fatally flawed. More specifically, 
  the appellants submit that Mr. Duncan's reliance on multiple layers of hearsay 
  and his systematic failure to make inquiries from primary sources to verify 
  the accuracy of the hearsay information amounted to a breach of his duty to 
  provide full, frank and fair disclosure and caused the Information to Obtain 
  to be fatally flawed. </p>
<p>
  [35] I do not agree with either submission.</p>
<p>
  The alleged deception </p>
<p>
  [36] The applications judge found that while Mr. Duncan had misrepresented the 
  nature of the document that he relied upon, the misrepresentation did not constitute 
  deliberate deception. As a finding of fact, this determination is entitled to 
  deference and is fully justified on the record. </p>
<p>
  [37] The applications judge also found that, although the characterization of 
  the medium by which the Gondos information was conveyed to Mr. Duncan was misleading, 
  there was nothing misleading about the content of the information that was conveyed 
  to the issuing judge. The Gondos information does state that the software had 
  no value and gives reasons for that assessment. </p>
<p>
  [38] In light of these findings, the applications judge properly rejected the 
  submission that because the Gondos information was misrepresented as a valuation 
  report, the entire content of the Gondos information should be excised. As the 
  Supreme Court of Canada stated in R. v. Araujo (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 
  474, "[E]rroneous information is properly excised&#133;and the remaining 
  information then assessed in the totality of the circumstances." The applications 
  judge properly excised the term "valuation report" from the Information 
  to Obtain but left in the content of the Gondos information and justifiably 
  concluded that the warrant could have been issued on the basis of that information 
  alone. </p>
<p>
  [39] In a similar vein, the appellants assert that there were other defects 
  in Mr. Duncan's affidavit that, either singly or in combination with the "valuation 
  report" misrepresentation, ought to have led the applications judge to 
  find that the warrants ought not to have been issued. These are: the statement 
  that the Agensys partnership and Agensys Corporation were dealing at non-arms-length; 
  the failure to disclose positive consulting reports on the value of the software; 
  and, the characterization of the corporate appellant's failure to provide Gondos 
  with the source code.</p>
<p>
  [40] I need not deal with these contentions in light of the applications judge's 
  findings that there was no deception or attempt to mislead in the Information 
  to Obtain and his determination that the warrant would have been issued on the 
  basis of the Gondos information alone. Suffice to say that I see no error in 
  the applications judge's reasons or determinations in respect of any of these 
  contentions. On the contrary, the reasons show a full appreciation of the appellants' 
  arguments on each of these alleged defects, the relevant evidence and the applicable 
  legal principles. </p>
<p>
  Reliance on hearsay </p>
<p>
  [41] The applications judge considered the legal obligations of a deponent of 
  an Information to Obtain in light of the principles summarized by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in Araujo, supra. Although Araujo dealt with the legal standard 
  that an affiant supporting a wiretap application must meet, the applications 
  judge held that the principles were equally applicable to a determination of 
  the legal sufficiency of the Information to Obtain. In my view, he was correct 
  to do so. </p>
<p>
  [42] In both instances, in my view, the deponent is obliged to make full, fair 
  and frank disclosure of the material facts so that the issuing judge is able 
  to make a judicial assessment of whether the facts rise to the standard required 
  to meet the test for issuance of the warrant. See Araujo at pp. 469-70 in relation 
  to the disclosure obligation for search warrant deponents. </p>
<p>
  [43] In Araujo at p. 470, Lebel J. writing for the court, stated </p>
<p class="indent"> Finally, while there is no legal requirement for it, those 
  gathering affidavit material should give consideration to obtaining affidavits 
  directly from those with the best first-hand knowledge of the facts set out 
  therein, like the police officers carrying on the criminal investigation or 
  handling the informers. This would strengthen the material by making it more 
  reliable." </p>
<p>
  I note that the Information to Obtain in this case was made several years before 
  the decision in Araujo. In the future, a deponent for an Information to Obtain 
  should bear in mind the words of LeBel J. about the desirability of presenting 
  first-hand information in the Information to Obtain. However, although the deponent 
  of an Information to Obtain should consider obtaining information directly from 
  those with first-hand knowledge of the facts, it is not a legal requirement 
  that the deponent do so. Like search warrant applicants, such deponents are 
  entitled to rely upon hearsay. Again like search warrant applicants, where hearsay 
  is relied upon, it must be presented in a way that allows the issuing judge 
  to make his or her own determination about the reliability and trustworthiness 
  of the sources of information. The Information to Obtain should never attempt 
  to trick its readers. It should set out the facts truthfully, fully and plainly: 
  see Araujo at p.470. </p>
<p>
  [44] It is important that an affiant properly source all of the information 
  relied upon. In this case, Mr. Duncan adequately sourced all of the information 
  he relied upon with the exception of the information from the outside consultants, 
  Gondos &amp; Associates. There was no information before the issuing judge or 
  the reviewing judge as to the education, training or qualifications of the outside 
  consultants. Given the significance of the information provided by the outside 
  consultants and relied upon in the Information to Obtain, this omission is serious. 
  Where, as here, the hearsay information being relied upon is based upon highly 
  technical matters, adequately sourcing the information requires the provision 
  of sufficient information on the credentials of the expert that the issuing 
  judge can satisfy him or herself that the expert was qualified to make the determinations 
  in question.</p>
<p>
  [45] While the Information to Obtain is deficient in this regard, in my view 
  that deficiency is not sufficient to warrant quashing the search warrants for 
  three reasons. First, as an omission and in the absence of information that 
  Gondos &amp; Associates was not qualified to offer the opinions it did, it cannot 
  be seen to be a deliberate deception. Second, it was open to the issuing judge 
  to assume that Revenue Canada had hired competent outside experts given that 
  its express purpose for hiring the consultants was that "Revenue Canada's 
  Valuation's section did not have the required expertise". Third, the chronology 
  of events listed in para. 6 of the Information to Obtain shows that Revenue 
  Canada, in the person of Fred Traer, was closely involved in the Gondos review 
  of Agensys. It was open to the issuing judge to find by implication that Mr. 
  Traer's involvement and supervision of Gondos &amp; Associates provided a sufficient 
  degree of confidence in the reliability of the findings made by Gondos &amp; 
  Associates. </p>
<p>
  [46] In the Information to Obtain, Mr. Duncan also relied on the hearsay comments 
  of Joe Albanese, an investor, given to Mirko Komienovich, an officer with the 
  Tax Avoidance section of Revenue Canada. Mr. Duncan corroborated Mr. Albanese's 
  statements about his investments by reviewing his tax returns. He also confirmed, 
  with Mr. Komienovich, the information he had received with respect to Mr. Albanese 
  before swearing the Information to Obtain. </p>
<p>
  [47] In support of their application to quash the warrant, the appellants filed 
  an affidavit of Mr. Albanese that contradicted the accuracy of the statements 
  attributed to Mr. Albanese by Mr. Komienovich. As the applications judge noted, 
  this contradiction in statements illustrates the pitfalls of not relying on 
  first-hand information. However, the applications judge also found that there 
  was no evidence that Mr. Duncan was acting in bad faith when he put such information 
  to the issuing judge, nor was there a deliberate attempt to mislead the issuing 
  judge. </p>
<p>
  [48] In the circumstances of this case, where Mr. Duncan was relying upon information 
  given to him by other Revenue Canada employees, in my view there was no obligation 
  on Mr. Duncan to independently verify the accuracy of that information. The 
  instant case is readily distinguishable from R. v. Debot (1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 
  193 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Hosie (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.), two cases 
  concerning the sufficiency of evidence relied upon by the police that came from 
  a confidential source. In such situations, as the courts pointed out, the source 
  of the information is unproven: it is not known what the informer's source of 
  knowledge is, how current the information is or how the informer obtained the 
  information. Such information requires verification: see Debot at p. 281 and 
  Hosie at pp. 391-92.</p>
<p>
  [49] In the case at bar, the sources of information relied on by Mr. Duncan 
  were within Revenue Canada itself or emanated from an outside consultant that 
  had been hired by Revenue Canada to perform a valuation. There was no "tip" 
  from an unknown informer and the consultant's sources of knowledge and information 
  were known and disclosed. Even if the statements attributed to Mr. Albanese 
  could be seen to be akin to a "tip", his identity was known and steps 
  had been taken to confirm the information attributed to him.</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [50] Accordingly, I would dismiss both the motion to quash and the appeal.</p>
