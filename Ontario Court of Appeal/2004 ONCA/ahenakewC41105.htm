<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Russell G. Juriansz of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated December 5, 2003.</p>
<p></p>
<p>GOUDGE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The fundamental issue in this appeal is whether the Progressive Conservative 
  Party of Canada (the "PC Party") requires the unanimous consent of 
  all of its members to merge with the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance Party 
  (the "Alliance Party").</p>
<p>
  [2] Looking particularly to Astgen v. Smith et al., [1970] 1 O.R. 129 (C.A.), 
  the appellants say that the common law principles governing voluntary associations 
  make this necessary. </p>
<p> [3] At first instance, Justice Juriansz disagreed. He found the Canada Elections 
  Act<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> (the "Act")to be the governing law since 
  it regulates the merger of registered political parties and both the PC Party 
  and the Alliance Party are registered pursuant to the Act. He therefore held 
  that the Astgen requirement of unanimous consent does not apply.</p>
<p>
  [4] I agree with his conclusion, although for somewhat different reasons, and 
  would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p> [5] On October 15, 2003, Peter MacKay, leader of the PC Party, and Stephen 
  Harper, leader of the Alliance Party, signed an agreement-in-principle to establish 
  the Conservative Party of Canada. The agreement set out a road map by which 
  the two old parties would come together to create the new party, which would 
  then assume all the rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of both predecessor 
  parties.</p>
<p>
  [6] Paragraph 11 of that agreement required the two leaders to take the steps 
  necessary to achieve the support of their respective parties for this agreement 
  as expeditiously as possible, and by December 12, 2003 at the latest.</p>
<p>
  [7] On October 25, 2003, the Management Committee of the PC Party met to consider 
  the agreement-in-principle. It decided to call a special meeting of members 
  of the PC Party on December 6, 2003 and to put the following question to the 
  voting delegates: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Be it resolved that: The Agreement-in-principle on the Establishment of the 
  Conservative Party of Canada be approved and the Leader of the Progressive Conservative 
  Party of Canada and its Management Committee are instructed and authorized to 
  take all necessary steps to implement the Agreement.</p>
<p>
  [8] At its October 25 meeting, the Management Committee also decided that this 
  question would require the approval of at least two-thirds of the delegates 
  voting on the question. It also decided that those entitled to vote would be 
  certain persons listed in the by-laws of the PC Party and delegates elected 
  from each constituency association, campus club and affiliated organization. 
  Finally, it resolved that any dispute in connection with its authority to convene 
  the special meeting or its decisions concerning that meeting should be referred 
  to the Arbitration Committee of the PC Party for decision. Article 13 of the 
  Party's constitution provides that the Management Committee may refer any matter 
  other than a dispute related to the leadership selection process to the Arbitration 
  Committee for consideration and decision and that its decision is final and 
  binding and not subject to appeal or review on any grounds.</p>
<p>
  [9] Pursuant to this reference to arbitration by the Management Committee, on 
  November 5, 2003, a group of PC Party members opposed to the proposed merger 
  (including one of the appellants) asked the Arbitration Committee to decide 
  whether the resolution to be put to the special meeting was a proper question 
  and whether that resolution was capable of authorizing the leader of the PC 
  Party to take all necessary steps to implement the agreement-in-principle. The 
  Arbitration Committee set November 28 as the date to consider these matters.</p>
<p>
  [10] On November 20, 2003, the appellants commenced this application. They sought 
  a number of declarations relating to the special meeting scheduled for December 
  6. The most important of these was a declaration that the constitution of the 
  PC Party does not permit it to merge with another political party or to be dissolved 
  except with the unanimous consent of all of its members. They also sought a 
  permanent injunction to prevent the assets of the party from being transferred 
  to the Conservative Party. All of the relief sought was premised on the appellants' 
  fundamental position that common law principles prevent the PC Party from dissolving 
  or merging with another political party except with the unanimous consent of 
  all of its members.</p>
<p>
  [11] On November 26, 2003, the Arbitration Committee invited the appellants 
  to attend and participate in its hearing on November 28. Through counsel, the 
  appellants declined to do so, taking the position that the issues raised in 
  their application could not be referred to arbitration under the Party's constitution. 
  </p>
<p>
  [12] On December 3, 2003, the Arbitration Committee delivered its decision on 
  the matters before it, including the challenge to the resolution to be put to 
  the special meeting on December 6. In a fully reasoned report, it decided that 
  this resolution, if passed by the appropriate majority (namely two-thirds of 
  the voting delegates), satisfies the requirements of the PC Party's constitution 
  and is capable of both implementing the agreement-in-principle and constituting 
  the appropriate resolution of the members of the PC Party approving the merger 
  for the purposes of the Act.</p>
<p>
  [13] Justice Juriansz heard this matter on December 4, 2003. The next day he 
  released his eleven page reasons for judgment dismissing the application. </p>
<p>
  [14] The special meeting proceeded on December 6, 2003, and 90.4 per cent of 
  the delegates voting at the meeting voted in favour of the resolution.</p>
<p>
  [15] On December 7, 2003, both the PC Party and the Alliance Party applied to 
  the Chief Electoral Officer pursuant to s. 400 of the Act to merge and become 
  the Conservative Party of Canada. </p>
<p>
  [16] On the same day the Chief Electoral Officer reviewed and accepted the application 
  to merge and the Elections Canada Registry of Parties was amended, by replacing 
  the names of the Alliance Party and the PC Party with the name of the Conservative 
  Party. </p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [17] As a preliminary matter, the respondent moves to quash the appeal as now 
  being moot. It argues that there is no longer a live issue affecting the rights 
  of the parties because the merger has happened and the Conservative Party has 
  been registered by the Chief Electoral Officer in place of the PC Party and 
  the Alliance Party. </p>
<p>
  [18] In my view, the motion must be dismissed. There remains the same real legal 
  issue between the parties that existed before December 6, 2003, namely, whether 
  the PC Party can be dissolved or merged with another political party without 
  the unanimous consent of all of its members. The only difference is that if 
  they are successful, the appellants must now seek a remedial order undoing what 
  has happened rather than an order to prevent it from occurring. The respondent 
  has not shown that this would be impossible. The underlying legal issues still 
  have an effect on the rights of the parties and hence mootness does not apply. 
  </p>
<p>
  [19] On the appeal itself, the appellants' fundamental contention is that the 
  common law requires the PC Party to obtain the unanimous consent of all of its 
  members to merge with the Alliance Party. In making this argument they place 
  significant reliance on Astgen.</p>
<p>
  [20] That case, decided almost thirty-five years ago, involved the merger of 
  two trade unions. The majority decision in this court turned on its view of 
  a trade union as a voluntary association with no legal existence apart from 
  its members, who are bound to one another by contact. The majority held that 
  the common law recognized the voluntary association not as a legal entity, but 
  as nothing more than a complex of contracts between each member and every other 
  member. The terms of these contracts are to be found in the constitution and 
  by-laws of the voluntary association. </p>
<p>
  [21] In the majority's view, a merger with another voluntary association meant 
  not just the termination of the contractual relationship of all the members 
  with each other but also the substitution of new contractual relationships with 
  persons outside the group with whom the members were previously associated. 
  The majority viewed this two-fold change as so fundamentally affecting the contractual 
  rights of each member that a merger could only be effected with the unanimous 
  approval of all of the members, either directly, or through a procedure to which 
  all had agreed. In other words, each member of the voluntary association must 
  consent to the termination of his or her existing set of contractual relationships 
  and to be bound to a new set of contractual relationships. Only then can the 
  voluntary association merge lawfully. In short, because its legal essence is 
  to be viewed as a web of contracts between each member and every other member, 
  a voluntary association can merge only with the unanimous consent of all of 
  its members.</p>
<p>
  [22] Based on Astgen, the appellants' argument is simple. The PC Party is a 
  voluntary association, whose constitution contains no provision concerning merger, 
  let alone a procedure for merger to which all of the members have agreed. The 
  meeting of December 6, 2003, did not obtain the unanimous consent of all of 
  the members of the PC Party. Hence the merger cannot lawfully proceed. </p>
<p>
  [23] In my view, this argument cannot succeed for two reasons. First, it fails 
  to take account of the view that the law takes today of the legal status of 
  a registered political party such as the PC Party. That status depends on the 
  evolution that has taken place in the relevant case law, together with the existence 
  of the Act. Second, it fails to address the specific requirements for the merger 
  of registered political parties which Parliament has set out in ss. 400 to 402 
  of the Act. I will address each of these in turn.</p>
<p>
  [24] The law as enunciated in Astgen was significantly changed by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in 2002 in Berry v. Pulley, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 493. That case also 
  involved a trade union. The particular issue was whether one group of union 
  members could sue another group in the same union in breach of contract for 
  violating the terms of the union constitution. </p>
<p>
  [25] In concluding that this could not be done, the Supreme Court reviewed the 
  historic case law relating to unions as voluntary associations and the development 
  of what it called the legal fiction of a web of contracts among the members. 
  It then turned to what it described as the sophisticated statutory regime under 
  which trade unions are recognized as entities with significant rights and obligations 
  who must control and regulate their internal affairs in order to fulfill their 
  labour relations functions. Given this modern reality, the Supreme Court decided 
  that when a member joins a union, the contractual relationship is properly viewed 
  as being between the union and the member. Both are bound by the terms of the 
  union constitution. The legal fiction of the union as a voluntary association 
  whose legal essence is simply a complex of contracts between all of its members 
  was rejected as no longer appropriate.</p>
<p>
  [26] Thus, the Supreme Court recognized that where an entity has been accorded 
  significant statutory powers and duties, the concept that its members are bound 
  to each other through a complex of contracts is not applicable. For such an 
  entity, the requirement of unanimous consent for merger as set out in Astgen 
  can have no application. This requirement applied where the legal essence of 
  the entity was simply the web of contracts between its members in order to protect 
  the contract each member was said to have with every other member and to prevent 
  new contracts with new members from being imposed on each member without his 
  or her consent.</p>
<p>
  [27] If the legal essence of the PC Party cannot properly be viewed as a set 
  of contracts between each member and every other member, then in my view, the 
  common law requirement that there be unanimous consent of all of its members 
  for merger is not applicable.</p>
<p>
  [28] It is thus important to determine whether an entity like the PC Party has 
  been clothed with sufficient statutory rights and obligations that the principles 
  enunciated in Berry, supra, apply. </p>
<p>
  [29] For that, a brief examination of the provisions of the Act is necessary. 
  It contains detailed provisions by which a political party may become a "registered 
  political party". That status is achieved once the necessary application 
  has been made and the various conditions set by the legislation have been fulfilled. 
  The PC Party has done so, and has been accorded that status.</p>
<p>
  [30] The Act accords a number of rights to a registered political party, including 
  access to public funding in the form of tax credits, reimbursement of up to 
  22.5 per cent of its election expenses directly from the Treasury of Canada 
  and specific allocations of broadcast time. </p>
<p>
  [31] The Act also imposes a number of obligations on a registered political 
  party. For example, it must observe significant reporting requirements of both 
  general and financial information. It must maintain certain officials such as 
  registered agents and auditors. It must ensure that its election advertising 
  meets the statutory conditions. It must comply with the terms of any compliance 
  agreement that the Commissioner of Canada Elections may impose upon it. The 
  Act also provides that a registered political party is deemed to be a person 
  for any judicial proceeding and that it may be prosecuted for certain specified 
  offences.</p>
<p>
  [32] In short, the Act is a sophisticated statutory regime under which registered 
  political parties are recognized as entities with significant rights and obligations. 
  Following the reasoning in Berry, I think registered political parties are legal 
  entities at least for the purposes of fulfilling their roles in the election 
  process. To do so they must control and regulate their internal affairs. It 
  is as inappropriate to conceive of them as comprised simply of a web of contracts 
  between members as it is to do so for trade unions.</p>
<p>
  [33] Since this legal fiction is inapplicable to a registered political party, 
  so too is the corollary common law legal principle set out in Astgen that a 
  voluntary association, if it is to merge with another, requires the unanimous 
  consent of all of its members. In my view, the legal status of the PC Party 
  as a registered political party renders inapplicable to it the requirement contended 
  for by the appellants. </p>
<p>
  [34] My second reason for rejecting the appellants' position that the PC the 
  Party can merge only with the unanimous consent of all of its members is simply 
  that it is not required by the Act. Parliament has displaced any common law 
  requirements that might otherwise apply in this context by speaking in detail 
  about what is necessary for the merger of two registered political parties. 
  Sections 400 - 402 read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 400. (1) Two or more registered parties may, at any time other 
  than during the period beginning 30 days before the issue of a writ for an election 
  and ending on polling day, apply to the Chief Electoral Officer to become a 
  single registered party resulting from their merger.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An application to merge two or more registered parties must</p>
<p class="indent">(a) be certified by the leaders of the merging parties;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) be accompanied by a resolution from each of the merging 
  parties approving the proposed merger; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) contain the information required from a party to be registered, 
  except for the information referred to in paragraph 366(2)(i).</p>
<p class="indent">401. (1) The Chief Electoral Officer shall amend the registry 
  of parties by replacing the names of the merging parties with the name of the 
  merged party if</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the application for the merger was not made in the period 
  referred to in subsection 400(1); and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the Chief Electoral Officer is satisfied that</p>
<p class="indent">(i) the merged party is eligible for registration as a political 
  party under this Act, and</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the merging parties have discharged their obligations under 
  this Act, including their obligations to report on their financial transactions 
  and their election expenses and to maintain valid and up-to-date information 
  concerning their registration.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The Chief Electoral Officer shall notify the officers of 
  the merging parties in writing whether the registry of parties is to be amended 
  under subsection (1).</p>
<p class="indent">(3) If the Chief Electoral Officer amends the registry of parties, 
  he or she shall cause to be published in the Canada Gazette a notice that the 
  names of the merging parties have been replaced in the registry with the name 
  of the merged party.</p>
<p class="indent">402. (1) A merger of registered parties takes effect on the 
  day on which the Chief Electoral Officer amends the registry of parties under 
  subsection 401(1).</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) On the merger of two or more registered parties,</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the merged party is the successor of each merging party;</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) the merged party becomes a registered party;</p>
<p class="indent"> (c) the assets of each merging party belong to the merged party;</p>
<p class="indent"> (d) the merged party is responsible for the liabilities of 
  each merging party;</p>
<p class="indent"> (e) the merged party is responsible for the obligations of 
  each merging party to report on its financial transactions and election expenses 
  for any period before the merger took effect;</p>
<p class="indent"> (f) the merged party replaces a merging party in any proceedings, 
  whether civil, penal or administrative, by or against the merging party; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (g) any decision of a judicial or quasi-judicial nature involving 
  a merging party may be enforced by or against the merged party.</p>
<p>
  [35] Section 400 provides for two registered parties to apply to become a single 
  registered party resulting from their merger. Section 400(2)(b) sets out one 
  of the things Parliament has chosen to require of each party to achieve this, 
  namely, to provide a resolution of the party approving the proposed merger.</p>
<p>
  [36] Section 401 requires the Chief Electoral Officer to be satisfied that each 
  merging party has discharged its obligations under the Act before replacing 
  the names of the merging parties with that of the merged party in the registry 
  of parties.</p>
<p>
  [37] Section 402 provides that the merger takes effect when the Chief Electoral 
  Officer amends the registry. It then goes on to spell out the consequences of 
  the merger: the merged party becomes the successor of each merging party and 
  acquires the assets of the merging parties.</p>
<p>
  [38] There is no suggestion in this detailed regulatory scheme that Parliament 
  considered it necessary to require the unanimous consent of all of the members 
  of a merging party. The legislation contains no such requirement. The obligation 
  resting on a party is simply to pass the resolution approving the proposed merger. 
  Parliament did not deem it necessary that this resolution achieve any special 
  level of support amongst those voting, let alone the support of all of the members 
  of the party. Rather, the legislation treats registered political parties as 
  having reached a sufficient level of organizational maturity that they can determine 
  for themselves whether more than majority support of those voting is needed 
  for a resolution approving a proposed merger.</p>
<p>
  [39] While Parliament has chosen not to require from a registered party any 
  exceptional level of support for a proposed merger, it is implicit in s. 400(2)(b) 
  that the approving resolution be passed according to the rules found in the 
  constitution of the party. Parliament must be taken to require a resolution 
  that in that sense is lawful. However, in my view, the appellants' argument 
  that the common law requires the unanimous consent of all of the members of 
  the PC Party for it to lawfully merge with the Alliance Party is simply inconsistent 
  with Parliament's intention as embodied in s. 400(2)(b).</p>
<p>
  [40] In so far as the appellants argue (separately from their argument about 
  merger) for a requirement of unanimous consent of all members before the PC 
  Party can properly dissolve, the Act provides the same answer. In s. 402(2) 
  Parliament has said that once the merger of registered parties takes effect, 
  the merged party is the successor of each merging party and acquires the assets 
  of those parties. In effect, this constitutes the dissolution of the merging 
  parties. Again, Parliament has chosen not to require the unanimous consent of 
  all of the members as a prerequisite. In the face of this there is no room for 
  the common law to impose such a precondition. </p>
<p>
  [41] The last argument raised by the appellants is that even if common law principles 
  do not apply to require the unanimous consent of all members of the PC Party, 
  the merger with the Alliance Party is nonetheless unlawful because the resolution 
  passed on December 6, 2003, does not meet the requirements of the PC Party's 
  constitution and by-laws, and cannot therefore constitute the resolution required 
  pursuant to s. 400(2)(b) of the Act.</p>
<p>
  [42] The first answer to this argument is that the appellants abandoned this 
  attack at first instance. They indicated to Justice Juriansz that they were 
  not seeking the declaration requested in their original material, namely that 
  the procedures adopted for the December 6, 2003 meeting contravene the PC Party's 
  constitution and by-laws, thus rendering the resolution of no legal effect. 
  At first instance, the appellants made clear that they were making no attack 
  on the specific procedures adopted by the PC Party respecting the special meeting. 
  As a result, the application judge was not called on to adjudicate that issue. 
  In these circumstances, this court should not address that issue for the first 
  time on appeal.</p>
<p>
  [43] Moreover, even if we were inclined to entertain the argument on its merits, 
  in my view it would not succeed. I agree with the application judge that s. 
  401(1)(b)(ii) places on the Chief Electoral Officer, not the court, the initial 
  duty to be satisfied that the PC Party as a merging party has provided with 
  its application a resolution approving the proposed merger. While we need not 
  decide it in this case, I am inclined to the view that this task is concerned 
  with the facial validity of the resolution: on its face does the filed resolution 
  come from the merged party and does it approve the proposed merger? This would 
  not involve the Chief Electoral Officer in adjudicating a claim that the resolution 
  is of no legal effect because the party did not follow its own constitutional 
  requirements. In my view the latter, which would require evidence and argument, 
  is a task that Parliament does not appear to have equipped the Chief Electoral 
  Officer to perform. </p>
<p>
  [44] However, in the circumstances of this case, I do not view this task as 
  being for the court either. The very issue was referred by the Management Committee 
  to the Arbitration Committee of the PC Party pursuant to the provisions of its 
  constitution. The appellants had notice of and the opportunity to participate 
  in the hearing held by the Arbitration Committee. They chose not to do so. The 
  Arbitration Committee issued a thoroughly reasoned decision which concluded 
  that there was nothing in the Party's constitution requiring unanimous consent 
  for the resolution and that the proceedings put in place for the meeting of 
  December 6 and for voting on the resolution met the Party's constitutional requirements. 
  The resolution was therefore capable of constituting the approval of the proposed 
  merger called for by the Act.</p>
<p>
  [45] By the terms of the constitution this decision is final and binding. Having 
  had the opportunity to participate in that process the appellants are bound 
  to accept it as final and binding, subject to judicial review which they have 
  not sought. This is a corollary to the obligation of an organization like a 
  trade union to give notice of an arbitration to a member whose rights will be 
  affected because the decision of the arbitration board is final and binding. 
  See, for example, Hoogendoorn v. Greening Metal Products and Screening Equipment 
  Co., [1968] S.C.R. 30. It is not open to the appellants to seek a determination 
  by the court that the resolution is of no legal effect because the PC Party 
  failed to comply with the procedures required by its constitution. In this circumstance, 
  that is a matter for the Arbitration Committee.</p>
<p>
  [46] In summary, therefore, the appellants' arguments on appeal must be rejected.</p>
<p>
  [47] The respondent has cross-appealed from the decision of the application 
  judge to award no costs because of the public importance of the issues raised. 
  We did not call on the appellants to respond to the cross-appeal. In our view, 
  it was an entirely appropriate exercise of discretion by the judge of first 
  instance.</p>
<p>
  [48] As to the costs of the proceedings in this court, success has been divided. 
  The appellants failed on the appeal. The respondent failed to establish mootness 
  and failed on the cross-appeal. Together with the public importance of the questions 
  raised, this makes it appropriate to order that there be no costs in this court.</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  [49] I would therefore dismiss the motion to quash and the appeal and the cross-appeal. 
  No costs in this court.</p>
