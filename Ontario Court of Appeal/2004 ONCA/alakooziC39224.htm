<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants appeal the judgment of MacFarland J. dismissing their action 
  brought against the respondent doctors, in which the plaintiffs sought damages 
  arising from the death of Basir Alakoozi, born on July 3, 1986.</p>
<p>
  [2] From birth, Basir was plagued by numerous congenital health problems, including 
  Eisenmenger's Syndrome, diabetes, Down's Syndrome and albinism. </p>
<p>
  [3] Following a tonsillectomy and further surgery to repair two post-operative 
  tonsillar bleeds, Basir was discharged from hospital. He died the following 
  day, at home, of a heart attack.</p>
<p>
  [4] The conclusion of the trial judge that, given the complicated nature of 
  the medical evidence, this was not an exceptional case where she could find 
  negligence in the absence of expert opinion is amply supported by the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [5] The trial judge found that the plaintiffs' only expert, Dr. Barr, a pediatric 
  haematologist, lacked sufficient expertise to give an opinion on the standard 
  of care of an otolaryngologist. She also found that his opinion was affected 
  by a number of frailties in certain aspects of his evidence. The trial judge 
  preferred the evidence of Dr. MacRae, the defence paediatric otolaryngologist, 
  in determining the issue of the standard of care of an otolaryngologist. It 
  was Dr. MacRae's opinion that the decision to transfuse or not was a judgment 
  call and that the decision of the defendants not to transfuse was reasonable 
  in the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [6] The trial judge also properly dealt with the evidence of Dr. Rosenberg, 
  Dr. Wilson and Dr. Egger.</p>
<p>
  [7] In our view, the trial judge considered and weighed the evidence before 
  her, made well-reasoned findings of fact and there is no basis on which to interfere 
  with her decision. In dismissing the appeal, we should not be taken as agreeing 
  with the trial judge that where there are competing professional views about 
  standard of care, the court lacks jurisdiction to choose between them.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appeal must therefore be dismissed. In light of the trial judge's provision 
  that the action was dismissed with costs, if demanded, and the substantial amount 
  granted after costs were demanded, we make no order as to costs of the appeal.</p>
