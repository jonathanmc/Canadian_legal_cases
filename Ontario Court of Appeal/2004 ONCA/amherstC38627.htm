<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Donald R. Cameron dated July 7, 2002 
  and the costs award dated September 19, 2002.</p>
<p>FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This case raises for the first time in this court, the issue of the proper 
  treatment of RRSP proceeds following the death of the owner of the RRSP. Simply 
  stated, the issue is whether: (a) following the death of the owner of an RRSP, 
  the proceeds of the RRSP devolve directly to the designated beneficiary or form 
  part of the estate of the deceased owner; and (b) even if they do not form part 
  of the estate, whether creditors of the estate who remain unpaid have any claim 
  against the proceeds of the RRSP in the hands of the designated beneficiary. 
  This issue has caused a divergence of judicial opinion both within Ontario and 
  in other provinces.</p>
<p>
  [2] The facts of the case are quite typical. The appellant is a creditor of 
  the deceased. The respondent is the widow of the deceased and the designated 
  beneficiary of two RRSP funds. She received the proceeds of the two funds from 
  the two plan administrators. Because the estate of the deceased was unable to 
  pay all of its debts and declared bankruptcy, the creditor sought to obtain 
  payment of the outstanding debt owed by the estate from the beneficiary out 
  of the proceeds of the RRSPs.</p>
<p>
  [3] The application judge denied the creditor any recovery. He held that RRSPs 
  do not form part of the estate of the deceased but instead devolve directly 
  to the designated beneficiary. He held further, and contrary to the position 
  taken by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Clark Estate v. Clark (1997), 115 Man. 
  R. (2d) 48 (C.A.), that the creditor had no right to seek repayment of the debt 
  from the proceeds of the RRSPs in the hands of the designated beneficiary when 
  the estate was unable to pay its debts. </p>
<p>
  [4] I agree with the conclusion reached by the application judge. For the reasons 
  that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [5] Ashley James Perring died April 30, 1998. He made a will in 1994 naming 
  his wife, the respondent, the executrix and sole beneficiary of his estate. 
  He also designated the respondent as the beneficiary of two RRSPs, both in the 
  will and in separate designations filed with the administrators of the RRSPs, 
  one with Canada Trust Company and the other with the Royal Bank of Canada. The 
  respondent received the proceeds of the RRSPs ($117,000) in May 1998. The estate 
  filed an assignment in bankruptcy in April 1999, following which, the trustee 
  in bankruptcy demanded that the respondent pay the proceeds of the RRSPs to 
  the estate. She refused and proceeded to collapse the RRSPs, pay the withholding 
  tax and retain the balance of $82,000. The respondent was also the beneficiary 
  of her husband's three life insurance policies and upon his death received the 
  proceeds in the amount of approximately $1.27 million.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant is a creditor of the bankrupt estate. The debt of $53,679.28 
  was owed by the deceased as a director of a contractor corporation for breach 
  of trust under s. 13 of the Construction Lien Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 30. The 
  appellant filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy but remains unpaid. The appellant 
  obtained an assignment of the claim of the trustee against the respondent under 
  s. 38 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B. 3 in respect 
  of the RRSP proceeds, and brought the application in this matter on its own 
  behalf.</p>
<p>
  [7] Cameron J. held that the RRSP proceeds do not form part of the deceased's 
  estate and therefore of the bankrupt estate. He also addressed the secondary 
  question whether the creditor could seek payment of its debt directly from the 
  beneficiary of the RRSPs in accordance with the decision of the Manitoba Court 
  of Appeal in Clark. Cameron J. declined to follow Clark on this second issue, 
  and held that there is no basis for a creditor to claim any interest in proceeds 
  that do not form part of the estate of the debtor. He therefore dismissed the 
  application. He awarded the respondent costs of the application that he fixed 
  in the amount of $30,000. The appellant seeks leave to appeal the amount of 
  the costs award regardless of the outcome of the appeal on the merits.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES</p>
<p>
  (1) Do the proceeds of an RRSP devolve directly to the designated beneficiary, 
  or do they form part of the deceased's estate?</p>
<p>(2) If the RRSP devolves to the beneficiary, do the unpaid creditors of the 
  estate have a claim against the RRSP proceeds in the hands of the beneficiary?</p>
<p>(3) Should this court reduce the amount of costs ordered by the application 
  judge? </p>
<p>Issue 1: Do the proceeds of an RRSP form part of the deceased's estate?</p>
<p>[8] The appellant submits that the application judge erred by not holding that 
  the proceeds of an RRSP devolve to the designated beneficiary through the estate. 
  The appellant relies on s. 2(1) of the Estates Administration Act, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. E. 22 together with the proposition that at law, the designation of a beneficiary 
  of a fund is a testamentary disposition and therefore the fund devolves to the 
  estate and is subject to the claims of creditors before it can be paid out to 
  a designated beneficiary: see A.H. Oosterhoff, Oosterhoff on Wills and Succession, 
  5th ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2001) at 499; James MacKenzie, Feeney's Canadian 
  Law of Wills, 4th ed. (Markham: Butterworths, 2000) at 1.4 (para. 1.8). The 
  appellant completes the argument by pointing to legislation in two provinces, 
  British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, which specifically excludes the proceeds 
  of an RRSP from an estate and, in the case of Prince Edward Island, from the 
  claims of the estate's creditors, and to s. 196(1) of the Ontario Insurance 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I. 8,<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> which specifically 
  excludes insurance proceeds from the estate of the insured and from the reach 
  of creditors of the insured. The appellant says that there is no comparable 
  legislation for RRSP proceeds.</p>
<p>
  [9] Section 2(1) of the Estates Administration Act provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  2(1) All real and personal property that is vested in a person without a right 
  in any other person to take by survivorship, on the person's death, whether 
  testate or intestate and despite any testamentary disposition, devolves to and 
  becomes vested in his or her personal representative&#133;as trustee for the 
  persons by law beneficially entitled thereto, and, subject to the payment of 
  the persons' debts and so far as such property is not disposed of by deed, will, 
  contract or other effectual disposition, it shall be administered, dealt with 
  and distributed as if it were personal property not so disposed of.</p>
<p>
  [10] In Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Besharah (1989), 68 O.R. (2d) 
  443 (H.C.J.), the first case to address the issue of how an RRSP devolves to 
  a designated beneficiary, the trial judge reasoned that: (a) the RRSP was vested 
  in the deceased during his life and the designated beneficiary had no vested 
  interest in it until his death;(b) under s. 2(1) of the Estates Administration 
  Act, the deceased's vested RRSP devolved to his personal representative; (c) 
  counsel could not refer the court to any statutory exemption from the general 
  rule, applicable to RRSPs, comparable to the section of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 
  1980, c. 218, s. 173(1) (now R.S.O. 1990, c. I. 8, s. 196) which provides that 
  proceeds of a life insurance policy devolve directly to the designated beneficiary, 
  not to the estate and are not subject to the claims of creditors of the estate; 
  and (d) the RRSP therefore devolved to the deceased's estate to be paid out 
  to the designated beneficiary after the creditors of the estate were satisfied.</p>
<p>
  [11] Unfortunately, counsel in the Besharah case did not refer the trial judge 
  to s. 53 of the Succession Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S. 26, Part III, 
  entitled "Designation of Beneficiaries of Interest in Funds or Plans", 
  which provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> 53. Where a participant in a plan has designated a person to 
  receive a benefit under the plan on the death of the participant,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the person administering the plan is discharged on paying 
  the benefit to the person designated under the latest designation made in accordance 
  with the terms of the plan&#133;; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the person designated may enforce payment of the benefit 
  payable to him under the plan but the person administering the plan may set 
  up any defence that he could have set up against the participant or his or her 
  personal representative.</p>
<p>
  [12] Cameron J. read this section as excluding the personal representative of 
  the deceased owner of the RRSPs from any right to enforce payment of the proceeds 
  of a fund where there is a designated beneficiary, and as an exception for RRSPs 
  (and other such funds) from s. 2(1) of the Estates Administration Act. </p>
<p>
  [13] This conclusion is fully in accord with the analysis of the majority of 
  the Supreme Court of Canada in the 1957 case of Kerslake v. Gray, [1957] S.C.R. 
  516. In that case, the issue was whether a life insurance policy made payable 
  by a declaration by the deceased under the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 183, 
  to an ordinary beneficiary, formed part of the estate of the deceased. Section 
  164 of the Insurance Act specifically provided that insurance monies payable 
  to a preferred beneficiary were held in trust for the preferred beneficiary, 
  were not subject to the control of the insured or his creditors and did not 
  form part of the insured's estate. Section 161, which dealt with ordinary beneficiaries, 
  did not so provide. Section 161(2) was in virtually the same terms as the current 
  s. 53 of the Succession Law Reform Act. Section 161(1) permitted the insured 
  to designate a beneficiary by contract or declaration and subsequently change 
  the beneficiary; s.161(2) enabled the beneficiary to enforce the contract at 
  its maturity for the beneficiary's own benefit and provided that the insurer 
  could set up against the beneficiary any defence it had against the insured, 
  and that payment made to the beneficiary discharged the insurer.</p>
<p>
  [14] The Supreme Court held that s. 161 operated with respect to ordinary beneficiaries 
  in the same way that s. 164 operated in respect of preferred beneficiaries, 
  and that the personal representatives of the deceased insured had no claim to 
  monies that were payable under an insurance policy to an ordinary beneficiary. 
  Those monies did not form part of the estate.</p>
<p>
  [15] Importantly, although s. 161 did not contain explicit words, such as those 
  found in s. 164, protecting the proceeds of the insurance policy for the benefit 
  of ordinary beneficiaries both from inclusion in the deceased's estate and from 
  creditors of the insured, the court held that the effect of the two sections 
  was the same. </p>
<p>
  [16] The Manitoba Court of Appeal in Clark, supra, interpreted a provision in 
  the Manitoba legislation which dealt with RRSP proceeds and was worded similarly 
  to s. 161 of the Insurance Act (as it was worded in Kerslake) and to s. 53 of 
  the Ontario Succession Law Reform Act, to have the same meaning and effect as 
  those sections. The Retirement Plan Beneficiaries Act, C.C.S.M. c. R. 138 was 
  amended following the Manitoba Court of Appeal decision in Pozniak Estate v. 
  Pozniak (1993), 88 Man. R. (2d) 36 (C.A.). In that case, the Court had followed 
  the Ontario court in the Besharah case, holding that the proceeds of an RRSP 
  fund formed part of the gross value of the estate and were available to pay 
  the debts of the estate. Sections 14 and 15 of the amended Act read: </p>
<p class="indent"> 14. A person to whom a benefit is payable under a plan pursuant 
  to a designation may enforce payment of the benefit against the administrator 
  of the plan, but the administrator may set up any defence against the person 
  that it could have set up against the participant who made the designation. 
</p>
<p class="indent">15. Payment by the administrator of a plan of the benefits under 
  the plan in accordance with a designation is, in the absence of actual notice 
  of a subsequent designation or a subsequent revocation of the designation, a 
  full discharge to the administrator of its obligations under the designation. 
</p>
<p>
  [17] Based on the combination of the two new sections, and particularly on the 
  wording of s. 15, which is virtually identical to s. 53(a) of the Succession 
  Law Reform Act, the court in Clark held that the new sections were added to 
  modify the decision in Pozniak, and to allow the court to find that the RRSP 
  fund passed directly to the designated beneficiary and did not form part of 
  the deceased's estate.</p>
<p>
  [18] In my view, the decision of the Supreme Court in Kerslake, which has not 
  been overruled or disapproved since it was decided, compels the interpretation 
  given by Cameron J. and by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Clark. It appears 
  very clear that neither that case nor s. 53 of the Succession Law Reform Act 
  was brought to the attention of the trial judge in Besharah to assist the court 
  in its analysis of the devolution of RRSP proceeds to a designated beneficiary.</p>
<p>
  [19] The appellant also relies on the Supreme Court of Canada decision in MacInnes 
  v. MacInnes, [1935] S.C.R. 200, which held that a document made outside a will 
  that designates a beneficiary to a profit sharing fund is a testamentary document. 
  The appellant argues that an RRSP designation is such a document and because 
  it is testamentary, the proceeds of the RRSP fall into the estate of the RRSP's 
  owner. The problem with this argument is that it does not take the appellant 
  any further than did s. 2(1) of the Estates Administration Act, because s. 53 
  of the Succession Law Reform Act has been interpreted to constitute a statutory 
  exemption to the general rule that would otherwise apply.</p>
<p>
  [20] Cameron J. found logical support for his conclusion that the legislature 
  intended to except the proceeds of an RRSP that have been designated to a beneficiary 
  from devolution to the estate, in s. 72(1) of the Succession Law Reform Act 
  which provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> 72. (1) Subject to section 71, for the purpose of this Part, 
  the capital value of the following transactions effected by a deceased before 
  his or her death, whether benefitting his or her dependant or any other person, 
  shall be included as testamentary dispositions as of the date of the death of 
  the deceased and shall be deemed to be part of his or her net estate for purposes 
  of ascertaining the value of his or her estate, and being available to be charged 
  for payment by an order under clause 63(2)(f), </p>
<p class="indent">(a) gifts mortis causa;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) money deposited, together with interest thereon, in an account 
  in the name of the deceased in trust for another or others with any bank, savings 
  office, credit union or trust corporation, and remaining on deposit at the date 
  of the death of the deceased;(c) money deposited, together with interest thereon, 
  in an account in the name of the deceased and another person or persons and 
  payable on death under the terms of the deposit or by operation of law to the 
  survivor or survivors of those persons with any bank, savings office, credit 
  union or trust corporation, and remaining on deposit at the date of the death 
  of the deceased;(d) any disposition of property made by a deceased whereby property 
  is held at the date of his or her death by the deceased and another as joint 
  tenants;(e) any disposition of property made by the deceased in trust or otherwise, 
  to the extent that the deceased at the date of his or her death retained, either 
  alone or in conjunction with another person or persons by the express provisions 
  of the disposing instrument, a power to revoke such disposition, or a power 
  to consume, invoke or dispose of the principal thereof, but the provisions of 
  this clause do not affect the right of any income beneficiary to the income 
  accrued and undistributed at the date of the death of the deceased;(f) any amount 
  payable under a policy of insurance effected on the life of the deceased and 
  owned by him or her;(f.1) any amount payable on the death of the deceased under 
  a policy of group insurance; and(g) any amount payable under a designation of 
  beneficiary under Part III.</p>
<p>
  [21] Section 72(1) lists a number of transactions by a deceased, the proceeds 
  of which are deemed to be included as part of the deceased's estate for the 
  purpose of making and enforcing orders for dependants' relief. Cameron J. reasoned 
  that the existence of the section implies that the transactions listed in the 
  section are not otherwise testamentary dispositions and their proceeds do not 
  actually form part of a deceased's estate. Subsection (g) of s. 72(1): "any 
  amount payable under a designation of a beneficiary under Part III" includes 
  RRSPs. Section 51(1) in Part III provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> 51. (1) A participant may designate a person to receive a benefit 
  payable under a plan on the participant's death, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) by an instrument signed by him or her or signed on his or 
  her behalf by another person in his or her presence and by his or her direction; 
  or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) by will,</p>
<p class="indent">and may revoke the designation by either of those methods. </p>
<p>
  And "Plan" is defined in s. 50 of Part III as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> "plan" means,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) a pension, retirement, welfare or profit-sharing fund, trust, 
  scheme, contract or arrangement or a fund, trust, scheme, contract or arrangement 
  for other benefits for employees, former employees, directors, former directors, 
  agents or former agents of an employer or their dependants or beneficiaries,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) a fund, trust, scheme, contract or arrangement for the payment 
  of a periodic sum for life or for a fixed or variable term, or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) a fund, trust, scheme, contract or arrangement of a class 
  that is prescribed for the purposes of this Part by a regulation made under 
  section 53.1</p>
<p class="indent">and includes a retirement savings plan, a retirement income 
  fund and a home ownership savings plan as defined in the Income Tax Act (Canada) 
  and an Ontario home ownership savings plan under the Ontario Home Ownership 
  Savings Plan Act. ("regime") R.S.O. 1980, c. 488, s. 50; S.O. 1990, c. 9, s. 
  10; S.O. 1994, c. 27, s. 63(4), in force December 9, 1994 (R.A.). [Emphasis 
  added.]</p>
<p>
  [22] Cameron J. concluded that if the proceeds of an RRSP were already part 
  of the estate of a deceased, then s. 72(1)(g) would be meaningless. The appellant 
  disputes this conclusion, arguing that the section is there to remove any doubt 
  whether RRSP proceeds are included in the estate for the purpose of dependants' 
  relief. In my view, Cameron J. is correct. The legislature has specifically 
  included RRSPs in the s. 50 definition of a "plan", the benefit of 
  which may be made payable to a designated beneficiary, and by virtue of s. 53, 
  has excluded RRSPs from the estate of the owner. Section 72(1)(g) then includes 
  RRSPs in the value of an estate for the specific purpose of dependants' relief. 
  In this statutory context, there is no basis to suggest that the legislature 
  was in doubt about an issue over which it maintained legislative control.</p>
<p>
  [23] Cameron J. noted that the Ontario cases, Fekete Estate v. Simon (2000), 
  32 E.T.R. (2d) 202 (Ont. Sup. Ct.) and Banting v. Saunders Estate (2000), 34 
  E.T.R. (2d) 163 (Ont. Sup. Ct.), followed Clark on the issue of the devolution 
  of RRSP proceeds, rather than Besharah. After reviewing the current state of 
  the law, he agreed with the recent case law that "the proceeds of RRSPs 
  vest in the designated beneficiary on the death of the owner of the RRSPs."</p>
<p> [24] One issue that concerns some commentators about this interpretation of 
  s. 53 of the Succession Law Reform Act is why the legislature did not use language 
  similar to s. 196 of the Insurance Act, if its intent was to exempt RRSP proceeds 
  from s. 2(1) of the Estates Administration Act and from devolving to the estate 
  of a deceased planholder. The argument is that s. 53 is procedural only, but 
  does not vest the proceeds of the RRSP plan in the beneficiary to the exclusion 
  of the personal representative of the deceased or of the deceased's creditors.<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> 
  One answer to this argument is that it is not necessary to compare and justify 
  two sections that were enacted at different times and in different statutes. 
  A second answer is that for all the reasons set out above, and following the 
  interpretation given by the Supreme Court of Canada in Kerslake to language 
  similar to s. 53, its effect is to vest the proceeds of an RRSP in the designated 
  beneficiary to whom they are paid, without the specific language found in s. 
  196 of the Insurance Act.</p>
<p>
  Issue 2: Do creditors have a claim against the RRSP proceeds in the hands of 
  the beneficiary?</p>
<p>
  [25] Cameron J. declined to follow the second part of the decision of the Manitoba 
  Court of Appeal in Clark, that the proceeds of an RRSP in the hands of the designated 
  beneficiary remain answerable for the debts of the deceased if there are insufficient 
  funds in the estate to satisfy all of the creditors of the deceased. He found 
  that there is neither a legal nor equitable basis for that conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [26] He began by observing that there is no authority other than Clark and the 
  two Ontario cases that followed it, to support the conclusion reached by those 
  courts on this </p>
<p>
  issue. In summary, the analysis in the Clark case is: (1) there is no specific 
  statutory exemption from creditors for RRSP proceeds; (2) unlike life insurance 
  proceeds that never belonged to the deceased, RRSP proceeds did belong to the 
  deceased before death and were answerable for the owner's debts; (3) therefore, 
  if the estate cannot pay the debts, the proceeds should be available in the 
  hands of the beneficiary to respond to the claims of creditors, because creditors 
  rank ahead of a volunteer: Re Diplock [1948] 1 Ch. 465 (C.A.); (4) sections 
  14 and 15 of the Retirement Plan Beneficiaries Act, the equivalent to s. 53 
  of the Succession Law Reform Act, is only a mechanism for the payment of the 
  RRSP proceeds to the beneficiary and does not immunize those proceeds from the 
  claims of creditors of the deceased.</p>
<p>
  [27] Cameron J. disputed these findings and legal conclusions both as a matter 
  of logic and statutory interpretation and as a matter of policy, to the extent 
  that policy considerations assist in the interpretation of the intent and effect 
  of s. 53.</p>
<p>
  [28] First, dealing with the legal effect of the RRSP proceeds devolving to 
  the designated beneficiary and not the estate, Cameron J. stated that once that 
  happens, there is no security interest in the proceeds in favour of the creditors 
  or other means by which the proceeds remain liable to the claims of creditors. 
  He likened the effect in that respect to jointly held property: prior to death, 
  the creditors of each joint owner can claim that owner's share of the jointly 
  held property, but upon the death of one owner, the whole property vests in 
  the surviving joint owner and the creditors of the deceased have no further 
  claim against it.</p>
<p>
  [29] Cameron J. next addressed the argument that insurance proceeds are different 
  from RRSP proceeds because they never belonged to the insured and therefore 
  could never be attached by the insured's creditors, whereas the RRSP was liable 
  during the life of the owner to the claims of creditors. The argument here is 
  that very specific language is therefore needed to remove the creditors' entitlement 
  to RRSPs, whereas in the case of insurance proceeds, the creditors never had 
  any claim to them during the life of the insured, so that nothing is being taken 
  away. In response, Cameron J. pointed out first that contrary to this argument, 
  some insurance policies have a cash surrender value that can be dealt with by 
  an insured during his or her life and therefore potentially claimed by creditors 
  during the life of the insured. Second, from a policy point of view, to the 
  extent that both RRSPs and life insurance are used by people to provide security 
  for their dependant spouses following their death, insurance paid for by premiums 
  and RRSPs accumulated by tax-deferred savings over the years, are essentially 
  equivalent vehicles. On that view, barring statutory language that would preclude 
  such a result, both should be treated in the same way in the hands of a surviving 
  beneficiary and not be subject to the claims of creditors of the deceased.</p>
<p>
  [30] Developing that theme further, Cameron J. weighed the claim of a spouse 
  who has provided physical and emotional support to the other spouse during his 
  or her lifetime against the claims of creditors of the deceased spouse, and 
  rejected the conclusion that the equities necessarily favour the creditors. 
  Put another way, a spouse beneficiary of an RRSP is not a mere volunteer in 
  the commonly understood sense; rather, a spouse has given consideration or a 
  quid pro quo during the lifetime of the other spouse, and in return, receives 
  the RRSP proceeds for support after the death of the other spouse.</p>
<p>
  [31] Finally, Cameron J. observed that there is no need for a specific statutory 
  exemption from creditors in order to immunize RRSP proceeds from the claims 
  of creditors of the deceased, again comparing the RRSP to jointly held property 
  that devolves to the other joint tenant free of claims of creditors of the deceased 
  without any specific exemption. He held that the absence of a specific exemption 
  from creditors is not enough to conclude that, by default, creditors have a 
  claim on the RRSP proceeds in the hands of a designated beneficiary. The comparison 
  to jointly held property in this context may be less relevant because on death, 
  the property passes by right of survivorship and belongs solely to the surviving 
  joint owner; consequently there is nothing left that belongs to the deceased 
  from which to except the claims of creditors of the deceased. However, as discussed 
  above, I agree with Cameron J. that the absence of words that specifically exempt 
  RRSP proceeds designated to a beneficiary from creditors does not derogate from 
  the effect of s. 53, which is to remove the proceeds of an RRSP that have been 
  designated to a beneficiary from the estate of the owner of the RRSP, and to 
  insulate those proceeds from the claims of creditors of the deceased's estate.</p>
<p> [32] I also note the priority and procedural concerns for creditors suggested 
  by Barry Corbin in "RRSPs: Partial Protection Against Creditors?" (2000) 20 
  E.T.P.J. 33 at 43-44, if the Clark analysis on the second issue is correct: 
  (a) If there are two or more unsatisfied creditors, how do they attach the RRSP 
  proceeds in the hands of the beneficiary and is there a mechanism for them to 
  share those proceeds? (b) If there is more than one beneficiary, are they entitled 
  to contribution and indemnity among themselves? (c) What is the priority between 
  the estate creditors and creditors of the beneficiary, particularly if the beneficiary 
  is bankrupt? Although these issues could be resolved on a case-by-case basis, 
  their existence enhances the cogency of the argument that the legislature intended 
  s. 53 to be a full exemption of RRSP proceeds from the estate of the deceased 
  and from the claims of estate creditors. Otherwise, it would make more sense 
  for the executor of the estate to have the obligation of collecting the RRSP 
  proceeds and distributing them after creditors' claims have been paid.<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> 
</p>
<p> [33] I agree with Cameron J. that there is neither a legal principle nor statutory 
  authority that requires that the creditors have any claim on the proceeds of 
  an RRSP that devolve directly to a designated beneficiary. I also agree that 
  the equities do not necessarily favour the claims of creditors over those of 
  beneficiaries of RRSP. The beneficiaries are often spouses, and therefore, not 
  volunteers in the traditional sense, but partners in life, who have provided 
  support to their spouses with the expectation that they will be supported after 
  the death of their spouses. Finally, there are several potential procedural 
  difficulties if creditors are permitted to pursue beneficiaries directly for 
  the proceeds of the RRSPs in their hands.</p>
<p>
  [34] I am also satisfied that in order to give full effect to s. 53 as an exemption 
  from the rule that an RRSP designation is a testamentary disposition, and following 
  Kerslake, it would be anomalous to hold that RRSP proceeds that have devolved 
  to the designated beneficiary remain subject to the claims of the creditors 
  of the deceased.</p>
<p>
  [35] I therefore conclude that the effect of s. 53 is to except RRSP proceeds 
  in the hands of a designated beneficiary from the claims of creditors of a deceased 
  RRSP owner's estate.</p>
<p>
  Issue 3: Should this court reduce the application judge's award of costs?</p>
<p>
  [36] The appellant submits that the application judge erred in his award of 
  costs. He ordered costs payable by the appellant creditor on the partial indemnity 
  scale in the amount of $30,000. The application judge justified the size of 
  the costs award in part on the basis that the application originally included 
  a claim to the life insurance proceeds of $1.27 million, which the appellant 
  abandoned only 4 or 5 days before the hearing, after respondent's counsel had 
  prepared his factum.</p>
<p>
  [37] I agree with the appellant that the application judge erred in this regard. 
  Counsel are encouraged to abandon (or settle) in a timely manner, claims that 
  they conclude are not meritorious. Although the costs award could take some 
  account of the relatively late timing in this case, it is an error to award 
  costs as if $1.27 million were at stake in this application.</p>
<p>
  [38] The application judge also viewed the case as putting the entire $82,000 
  of RRSP proceeds at risk, when the appellant's claim was for $53,679.28. Under 
  rule 57.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, the first factor to be taken into 
  account in considering the appropriate amount to award for costs is the amount 
  in issue. The rule reflects the principle that the costs must be commensurate 
  with the value of the lawsuit to the parties. In that light, an award of costs 
  of $30,000 on the partial indemnity scale constitutes an error in principle, 
  and rather appears to be an award on the substantial indemnity scale.</p>
<p>
  [39] I would grant leave to appeal the award of costs and reduce the award to 
  $15,000.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [40] I would dismiss the appeal on the substantive issues, but grant leave to 
  appeal and allow the appeal with respect to costs and reduce the costs awarded 
  to $15,000. </p>
<p>
  [41] With respect to the costs of the appeal, this case raised jurisprudential 
  issues for the first time in this court on a matter on which there is significant 
  developing and conflicting case law and legal scholarship. For that reason and 
  also again because of the amount in issue, I would limit the respondent's costs 
  on the appeal to $15,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
