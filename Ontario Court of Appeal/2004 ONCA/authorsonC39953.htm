<p>Proceedings under the Class Proceedings Act, 1992.</p>
<p>On appeal from the order of Justice John H. Brockenshire of the Superior Court 
  of Justice in Windsor dated March 24, 2003.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] The issue in this appeal is whether the government scheme for the economic 
  protection of veterans and their dependants should be interpreted in a way that 
  interferes with the priority currently given to spouses and dependants of deceased 
  veterans.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant was certified by the Superior Court of Justice to act as a 
  representative plaintiff in a class action concerning a network of veterans' 
  benefit statutes, collectively referred to as the Veterans' Charter. Brockenshire 
  J. divided the litigation into two separate proceedings dealing with liability. 
  The first part related to disabled veterans' entitlement to interest on money 
  administered on their behalf by the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA). On 
  July 17, 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada denied this claim. (See Authorson 
  v. Canada (Attorney General), 2003 SCC 39, rev'g (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.), 
  aff'g (2000), 53 O.R. (3d) 221 (Ont. S.C.).)</p>
<p>
  [3] The second part of the litigation concerned the argument that the Crown 
  is obliged to pay administered funds to veterans' estates when veterans died. 
  That is the issue on this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant concedes that the Crown has the power to divest such funds 
  on the death of a veteran. His argument, however, is that to do so, there must 
  be clear statutory language, and that no such clarity exists here. He therefore 
  argues that the funds should pass automatically to the veteran's estate, rather 
  than revert to the Crown to be dispersed to the veteran's spouse and dependants. 
  </p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [5] The Class factum, quoted by the motions judge, summarized the relevant issues 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This motion concerns two statutory and regulatory provisions: s. 31 of the Pension 
  Act [R.S.C. 1985, c. P-6] and its histor-ical antecedents and s. 55 of the Veterans 
  Treatment Regulations [C.R.C., c. 1585] and its antecedents. These provisions, 
  whose validity is challenged on constitutional, quasi-constitutional, legislative, 
  and fiduciary principles, purport to prevent administered pensions and treatment 
  allowances held in trust on a veteran's death from passing to that veteran's 
  estate. The plaintiff contends that these impugned provisions are inoperative, 
  ultra vires or otherwise ineffective to allow the Crown to confiscate funds 
  which should have been paid over to the estates. The plaintiff seeks a judgment 
  for a full accounting of all funds so confiscated, and an order that these funds 
  be disgorged.</p>
<p>
  [6] The DVA administered the funds of disabled veterans who were deemed incapable 
  of managing their own affairs. There are two types of administered funds at 
  issue: pensions and treatment allowances. Pensions were awarded by the Canadian 
  Pension Commission under the Pension Act. Unspent pensions accumulated in veterans' 
  accounts.</p>
<p>
  [7] In addition to pensions, the Veterans Treatment Regulations provided for 
  treatment allowances to veterans who were in the hospital or undergoing medical 
  treatment. Treatment allowances made up the difference between the veterans' 
  partial disability pension and their full pension during the period they could 
  not work. Unspent treatment allowances remained as credits in veterans' accounts.</p>
<p>
  [8] The disputed provisions have been characterized throughout these proceedings 
  as "lapsing provisions", providing that pensions or allowances held 
  in trust do not form part of the deceased veteran's estate. Until 1986, s. 31 
  of the Pension Act read: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1)Any pension or allowance held in trust by the Commission 
  or the Department and due to a deceased pensioner at the time of his death does 
  not form part of the estate of the deceased pensioner [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The Commission may, in its discretion, direct the payment 
  of a pension or an allowance referred to in subsection (1) either to the surviving 
  spouse or child or children of the pensioner, or the surviving spouse and child 
  or children, or may direct that it be paid in whole or in part to any person 
  who has maintained, or been maintained by, the pensioner or toward the expenses 
  of the pensioner's last sickness and burial.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) If no order for the payment of a pension or an allowance 
  referred to in subsection (1) is made by the Commission, the pension or allowance 
  shall not be paid [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [9] In 1986, the Pension Act was amended to allow the Commission to pay pensions 
  to veterans' estates, as well as to their spouses and children. The amended 
  section states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Commission may, in its discretion, direct the payment of any pension or 
  allowance referred to in subsection (5) either to the pensioner's estate or 
  to the pensioner's widow or his child or children, or to the widow and child 
  or children, or may direct that it be paid in whole or in part to any person 
  who has maintained him or been maintained by him or toward the expenses of the 
  pensioner's last sickness and burial [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [10] In 1954, the Veterans Treatment Regulations, issued under the Department 
  of Veterans Affairs Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. V-1 (DVAA), gave the DVA authority 
  to dispose of deceased veterans' treatment allowances. Section 55 of these regulations, 
  like s. 31 of the Pension Act, states that credits from treatment allowances 
  shall not form part of veterans' estates, but may be paid to veterans' dependants, 
  people who maintained them, or toward their funeral expenses. Section 55 states: </p>
<p class="indent"> Where on the death of a veteran or qualified person his account 
  shows a credit resulting from an award made pursuant to these Regulations or 
  any other Regulations respecting treatment of a veteran made prior to enactment 
  of these Regulations, the amount of that credit shall not form part of his estate 
  but may, where the Deputy Minister so orders, be paid in whole or in part</p>
<p class="indent">(a) to or on behalf of a dependant of that veteran or qualified 
  person;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) to a person who maintained that veteran or qualified person 
  or has been maintained by that veteran or qualified person; or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) towards the expenses of the last sickness and the funeral 
  and burial of that veteran or qualified person, where such expenses have not 
  been paid in full from public funds [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [11] Unlike s. 31 of the Pension Act, there has never been any amendment allowing 
  for payment of pensions to veterans' estates. As a matter of practice, however, 
  payments have, in fact, sometimes been made to their estates.</p>
<p> [12] The motions judge's findings can be summarized as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The decision to provide veterans' benefits is an act of "grace and bounty" 
    by the Crown. There is no common law right to pensions or treatment allowances. 
    Therefore, the Crown may prima facie impose any restrictions it wants on these 
    benefits. (paras. 4-6)</li>
  <li>The lapsing provisions are not ultra vires the federal government although 
    they affect veterans' property and civil rights in the province. The pith 
    and sub-stance of the legislation is pensions and allowances for veterans 
    of federal military service, which falls under s. 91(7) of the Constitution 
    Act, 1867. (para. 27)</li>
  <li>The legislation does not violate ss. 1(a), 1(b) or 2(e) of the Bill of Rights. 
    There is no equality violation because the legislation has a valid federal 
    purpose: to help veterans cover their living expenses, including their obligations 
    to their dependants. (para. 38) There is no "taking" or confiscation here 
    because pensions and allowances are subject to statutory limitations, so there 
    is no entitlement to a fair hearing. (paras. 40-41)</li>
  <li>The lapsing provisions do not violate s. 15 of the Charter. They are part 
    of a broad government program designed to rehabilitate veterans and assist 
    them to reintegrate into society. The lapsing provisions protect veterans 
    by barring the claims of creditors and other third parties. They therefore 
    preserve rather than deny dignity. (paras. 52-53)</li>
  <li>The Crown does not have a fiduciary duty to transfer administered funds 
    to veterans' heirs. As trustee, the DVA could not change the fundamental nature 
    of the property it administered as "grace and bounty". Instead, the DVA had 
    to comply with the statutes and regulations governing veterans' funds. (paras. 
    66-68)</li>
  <li>The Veterans Treatment Regulations were intra vires the DVAA until 1986. 
    The DVAA authorizes regulations "for the disposal" of veterans' properties 
    to them, their dependants or their estates "or as may be deemed expedient". 
    Section 55 of the regulations bars veterans' allowances from passing to their 
    estates. This is intra vires the DVAA, which permits but does not require 
    properties to pass to veterans' estates.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent5"> After 1986, the Pension Act was amended to allow veterans' 
  funds to be paid to their estates. As of 1986, the Veterans Treatment Regulations 
  conflict with the statutory scheme (though not directly with their enabling 
  statute, the DVAA) and become ultra vires. (paras. 88-91) Partial summary judgment 
  was granted on this point, s. 55 was declared void, and all treatment allowances 
  of veterans who died after 1986 were ordered to devolve to their estates. </p>
<p>
  [13] The appellant restricted his arguments on appeal to two main issues: the 
  interpretation of s. 31 of the Pension Act; and the finding that s. 55 was ultra 
  vires only after 1986, but not before, the appellant arguing that the motions 
  judge ought to have found s. 55 ultra vires as of 1954 when the DVA first received 
  statutory authority to dispose of treatment allowances. The Crown cross-appealed 
  on the ultra vires finding. We did not find it necessary to call on the Crown 
  on the main appeal.</p>
<p>
  THE APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [14] In our view, Brockenshire J. correctly interpreted s. 31 of the Pension 
  Act and s. 55 of the Veterans Treatment Regulations in a manner that was consistent 
  with the scheme of veterans' benefits, the language of the provisions, and the 
  government's goal of ensuring that the primary beneficiaries of those public 
  funds were the veterans, their spouses and their dependants, not distant relatives 
  or creditors.</p>
<p>
  [15] The purpose of the veterans' benefits scheme was described by the motions 
  judge at paras. 20-21: </p>
<p class="indent"> The pensions and allowances being dealt with here were and 
  are part of a vast network of benefits and support systems initially set up 
  after the first World War and added to ever since, all directed to aiding and 
  assisting veterans, their spouses and children, and their other dependants. 
  I am satisfied, from reading the lengthy affidavit of Professor Desmond Morton, 
  and the chapters of his book on the development of the pension system, filed 
  by the Crown, as well as copies of House of Commons debates, Parliamentary Committee 
  and Royal Commission proceedings and debates and extensive other materials filed 
  by the Crown, that following World War 1, the Government of Canada was concerned 
  to set up a system of aiding and assisting veterans in re-integrating into society 
  if possible, and of taking care of the thousands of veterans who had been disabled, 
  physically, mentally, or both, in the war, and their spouses, dependent children 
  and other dependants, if any. Many of these were young single men who had no 
  dependants.</p>
<p class="indent">In setting up its legislation for veterans, Canada looked to 
  other jurisdictions, notably England and especially the United States, and paid 
  heed to concerns expressed over scandalous excesses in the U.S.A., where at 
  one point pensions and allowances made up one-fifth of the national expense, 
  and anecdotes about young girls marrying elderly civil war veterans on their 
  death beds to collect their pensions were well known. It appears from the records 
  in the evidence, and the debates, that from the beginning the intent was that 
  pensions and allowances help the veterans, and those that were dependent on, 
  or who had helped them, and not other persons. There were early concerns over 
  "fifth cousins" making claims. There were concerns over "red tape" and expense 
  in probate applications. There were also concerns over creditors claiming in 
  priority to spouses and dependants. </p>
<p>
  [16] The lapsing provisions are consistent with the legislative focus on supporting 
  only veterans and their spouses and dependants. The lapsing provisions direct 
  that in situations where a veteran's funds are being administered and he or 
  she dies with pension funds or treatment allowances held in trust, the pensions 
  or treatment allowances do not form part of the veteran's estate. The Commission 
  (now the Minister) has a discretion to direct that the funds be paid to the 
  veteran's dependants, to those who cared for the veteran, or to last sickness 
  and burial expenses, or, since 1986, to the veteran's estate. If the administered 
  pension funds and treatment allowances are not paid in accordance with the governing 
  sections, however, the funds are returned to the government. </p>
<p>
  [17] To ensure that the pensions went only to provide for the needs of veterans 
  and their dependants, as well as those who helped maintain them, the lapsing 
  provisions in s. 31 of the Pension Act state that any pension or allowance held 
  in trust by the Crown does not form part of the veteran's estate, where it might 
  find its way into the hands of distant relatives or creditors. As the motions 
  judge held: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The undisputed evidence before me on this application was that the "lapsing" 
  provisions were a very small part of a very large network of legislation, all 
  designed to provide what some called the "Veterans' Charter". The 
  general thrust of the scheme was to reintegrate the veterans into society, but 
  it was recognized that, sadly, there were some veterans who had been so badly 
  injured physically or mentally that their reintegration was unlikely, and continuing 
  care, including for some the management of their entitlements, would be necessary. 
  At the same time, the evidence shows that Canada looked to the experience of 
  other countries, and was particularly concerned over the experiences in the 
  United States, where both the totality of the claims and the particulars of 
  some claims were looked on as scandalous. The government therefore developed 
  a policy of regarding pensions and allowances as being intended for the benefit 
  and assistance of veterans and their families and dependants to the exclusion 
  of others. Those concerns were perceived as fair to the veterans, and as very 
  important to society, after the First World War when the legislation was being 
  formulated.</p>
<p>
  [18] In concluding that the Crown was entitled to impose restrictions on the 
  pensions and allowances paid to veterans, the motions judge found at para. 4: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In my view, it is fundamental to this case to appreciate that the money that 
  was paid as pensions and allowances had been the money of the Crown, which had 
  no obligation to make such payments, except such as it imposed on itself. Nobody 
  argued before me, or pointed to any case law suggesting, a common law right 
  of a veteran to make a claim against the Crown for a pension or an allowance, 
  even if disabled in the service of his or her country. Indeed, the case law 
  points in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>
  [19] In our view, there is no ambiguity in the legislation, which clearly states 
  that no funds be paid automatically to the veteran's estate. The interpretation 
  of the lapsing provisions sought by the appellants would defeat the purpose 
  of the provisions of the Veterans' Charter, because it would require that surplus 
  funds go to the veteran's estate, rather than to the surviving spouse, children 
  or other dependants.</p>
<p>
  [20] The appeal is accordingly dismissed.</p>
<p>
  THE CROSS-APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [21] On the cross-appeal, the Crown argued that the motions judge erred in concluding 
  that s. 55 of the Veterans Treatment Regulations was ultra vires after 1986. 
  The motions judge held that when s. 31 of the Pension Act was amended in 1986 
  to give the Commission the option of transferring the administered funds to 
  veterans' estates, this created an inconsistency with s. 55 of the Veterans 
  Treatment Regulations, which provided for no such discretion in connection with 
  treatment allowances. With respect, we do not agree with the motions judge. 
  Having found, correctly in our view, that the provisions of s. 55 were intra 
  vires before 1986, he ought to have concluded that they remained intra vires 
  notwithstanding changes to the Pension Act.</p>
<p>
  [22] The enabling statute for s. 55 was not the Pension Act, but s. 5(1)(d) 
  of the DVAA, which provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> Subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, the Minister 
  may make such regulations as he may deem necessary and advisable. </p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) for the receipt and retention of any properties or moneys 
  held or payable by the Crown or any other authority, person or persons on behalf 
  of any persons or their dependants whenever such persons are being or have been 
  cared for under the provisions of this Act, either by medical treatment, training 
  or otherwise, and for giving therefor a valid receipt, and in the case of insane 
  persons who are being or have been so cared for under this Act, the assumption 
  or authorization of guardianship in whole or in part in respect of such properties 
  or moneys, and for the disposal of such properties or moneys to such persons 
  or their dependants, or as may be deemed expedient or the disposal thereof to 
  the estates of such persons if deceased [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [23] The fact that s. 55 does not provide for payment of treatment allowances 
  to the veteran's estate, a possibility provided for in the enabling legislation, 
  does not make the regulation ultra vires. There is no interpretive principle 
  which requires that subordinate legislation mirror exactly the enabling statute. 
  It cannot exceed the enabling statute's parameters, but neither is it obliged 
  to implement full jurisdictional scope. As the motions judge correctly observed, 
  s. 5(1)(d) of the DVAA is permissive, not mandatory. He also correctly noted 
  that the DVAA, not the Pension Act, is the statute authorizing s. 55. </p>
<p>
  [24] Having concluded that the enabling legislation is permissive, he erred, 
  with respect, in concluding that subordinate legislation that is under-inclusive 
  of its enabling statute is thereby ultra vires. The fact that s. 31 of the Pension 
  Act - which was traditionally mirrored by s. 55 - provides a wider range of 
  options on the veteran's death does not render ultra vires the narrower range 
  of options found in s. 55 of the Veterans Treatment Regulations.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION </p>
<p>
  [25] Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal with costs, allow the cross-appeal 
  with costs, set aside paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the order of Brockenshire J., 
  and dismiss the motion for summary judgment in its entirety. The Crown is entitled 
  to its costs of both the appeal and cross-appeal fixed in the total amount of 
  $25,000.</p>
