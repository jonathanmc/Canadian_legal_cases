<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The moving party (&quot;the plaintiff&quot;) was certified by the Superior 
  Court of Justice to act as a representative plaintiff in a class action concerning 
  veterans' benefits. In reasons dated March 13, 2002, the Court of Appeal for 
  Ontario determined that it was unnecessary to deal with whether s. 5.1(4) of 
  the Department of Veterans Affairs Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. V-1 (the &quot;DVA&quot;) 
  contravenes ss. 7 and 15 of the Charter, given that the appeal could be disposed 
  of based on the applicability of the Canadian Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1985, App. 
  III.</p>
<p>
  [2] Section 5.1(4) reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  No claim shall be made after this subsection comes into force for or on account 
  of interest on moneys held or administered by the Minister during any period 
  prior to January 1, 1990 pursuant to subsection 41(1) of the Pension Act, subsection 
  15(2) of the War Veterans Allowance Act or any regulations made under section 
  5 of this Act. </p>
<p>
  [3] The Crown appealed the decision of this court to the Supreme Court of Canada. 
  In a judgment released on July 17, 2003, the Supreme Court reversed this court's 
  decision concerning the applicability of the Canadian Bill of Rights to s. 5.1(4) 
  of the DVA. The Supreme Court did not address the Charter issue.</p>
<p>
  [4] The plaintiff initially brought a motion to bring the outstanding Charter 
  issue back before this court for adjudication. However, one of the members of 
  the original panel, Justice Austin, has now retired. As a result, the plaintiff 
  has moved for leave to re-argue the issue. </p>
<p>
  [5] At the conclusion of the argument of the motion for leave, we advised counsel 
  that the motion was dismissed with reasons to follow. These are those reasons.</p>
<p>
  [6] In the proceeding that gave rise to this appeal, the plaintiff sought, inter 
  alia, a declaration that s. 5.1(4) of the DVA violated the Bill of Rights. The 
  plaintiff did not seek a declaration that the section violated the Charter. 
  At the same time, the Crown moved for summary judgment to dismiss the plaintiff's 
  action. In its motion, the Crown sought a determination of the question of law 
  of whether s. 5.1(4) of the DVA violated ss. 7 or 15 of the Charter. </p>
<p>
  [7] The declaration sought by the plaintiff was granted. The Crown's motion 
  was dismissed but, in his reasons, the motion judge said that s. 5.1(4) did 
  not violate the Charter. </p>
<p>
  [8] The Crown appealed. In argument before this court, the plaintiff relied 
  almost entirely on the argument that s. 5.1(4) of the DVA violated the Bill 
  of Rights. The Charter issue was addressed only briefly. In view of its holding 
  that s. 5.1(4) violated the Bill of Rights, this court found it unnecessary 
  to decide whether s. 5.1(4) also violated the provisions of ss. 7 or 15 of the 
  Charter. </p>
<p>
  [9] We are not prepared to reopen this appeal to permit argument of the Charter 
  issue for two reasons. First, in seeking to reopen the issue, the plaintiff 
  is in effect now seeking relief, a declaration that s. 5.1(4) of the DVA breaches 
  the Charter, that he did not seek in the first instance. Second, the plaintiff 
  now has an alternative route for raising the same issue before this court. In 
  December 2003, the class action motion judge ruled that as a result of the decision 
  of the Supreme Court, the plaintiff's claim for damages must be reduced by the 
  amount of his claim for interest. If the plaintiff chooses, he may appeal that 
  decision and, in doing so, attempt to assert the Charter argument with respect 
  to the claim for interest.</p>
<p>
  [10] That said, we wish to emphasize that we are not opining on whether the 
  assertion of the Charter argument is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. 
  The issue of res judicata remains open and was not argued on the motion before 
  us. The point we make is nothing more than that the plaintiff, if he chooses, 
  will have the opportunity to argue the Charter issue before this court in the 
  same manner as he would have had were we to have granted the motion to reopen 
  the earlier appeal.</p>
<p>
  [11] For the above reasons, the motion is dismissed. As indicated at the conclusion 
  of argument, there will be no order as to costs.</p>
