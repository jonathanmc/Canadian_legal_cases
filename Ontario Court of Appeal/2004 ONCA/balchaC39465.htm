<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice Peter A. Grossi of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on November 29, 2002 and from the sentences 
  imposed on May 1, 2003.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, Sirage Balcha, was convicted of the offences of dangerous 
  driving causing bodily harm and failing to stop at the scene of an accident. 
  He received a total custodial sentence of two years less a day and a five year 
  driving prohibition. The appellant appeals both the convictions and the sentence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [2] On the conviction appeal, the appellant contends that the trial judge failed 
  to explain to the jury how to properly consider the evidence of his mental state, 
  in terms of both the mens rea for the offences and the automatism defence he 
  advanced.</p>
<p>
  [3] On the sentence appeal, the appellant contends that the trial judge committed 
  two errors: (1) he improperly characterized the appellant's dangerous driving 
  as 'intentional', and used this as an aggravating factor; and (2) he imposed 
  a sentence that was outside the range for these offences and this offender.</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  (1) The parties and the events</p>
<p>
  [4] Sirage Balcha was born in Ethiopia and immigrated to Canada in 1990 when 
  he was twenty-seven years old. He is now a Canadian citizen. He completed high 
  school and attended Humber College for courses in art, technology and truck 
  driving. In October 1998, he was employed as a truck driver. He had never been 
  in trouble with the law.</p>
<p>
  [5] On Saturday, October 18, 1998, Balcha and his girlfriend, Fathia Osman, 
  went dancing at a club called The Docks, near the harbour in Toronto. At about 
  2:00 a.m., the crowd in the club began to disperse. Balcha and Osman started 
  walking to their rented car.</p>
<p>
  [6] Three young men, Benji Badua, Joel Beza and Gary Guaing, also left The Docks 
  at the same time. In a random, unprovoked and vicious attack, Badua hit Balcha 
  on the forehead with a beer bottle. The three young men then ran down Cherry 
  Street.</p>
<p>
  [7] Balcha fell to the ground, bleeding profusely from his forehead. Osman assisted 
  her boyfriend to get to the car. Balcha started the car and drove it down Cherry 
  Street. The car mounted a curb and struck Guaing. The car then backed up over 
  Guaing. Shortly after, the police stopped Balcha. Balcha was then taken to a 
  hospital and his forehead was stitched up.</p>
<p>
  [8] Guaing was seriously injured. He suffered a dislocated jaw, two broken ribs, 
  a sprained ankle, a punctured lung, a broken nose and fractured cheekbones. 
  He spent nine days in hospital and ten months in rehabilitation.</p>
<p>
  [9] On January 21, 2000, Badua pleaded guilty to a charge of assault causing 
  bodily harm for having struck Balcha with a beer bottle. He was given a three 
  month conditional sentence, followed by six months of probation.</p>
<p>
  (2) The appellant's trial</p>
<p>
  [10] Balcha was charged with dangerous driving causing bodily harm and failing 
  to stop at the scene of an accident. He advanced an automatism defence.</p>
<p>
  [11] On November 29, 2002, a jury found Balcha guilty of both offences.</p>
<p>
  [12] On May 1, 2003, Grossi J. sentenced Balcha to two years less a day for 
  dangerous driving causing bodily harm and one year concurrent for failing to 
  stop at the scene of an accident. He also imposed a five year driving prohibition.</p>
<p>
  [13] Balcha appeals his convictions and sentence.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [14] The issues on appeal are: </p>
<p class="indent"> Conviction</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Did the trial judge fail to explain to the jury how to properly 
  consider the evidence of the appellant's mental state, in terms of both the 
  mens rea for the offences and the automatism defence advanced by the appellant?</p>
<p class="indent">Sentence</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Did the trial judge err by finding that the appellant had 
  intentionally struck the victim and by using this as an aggravating factor in 
  sentencing?</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Did the trial judge err by imposing a sentence that was 
  outside the range for these offences and this offender?</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p> The conviction appeal<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  (1) The trial judge's instruction about the appellant's mental state</p>
<p>
  [15] The appellant advanced the defence of automatism at his trial. On that 
  issue, he bore the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that he had 
  acted involuntarily. The appellant does not challenge the trial judge's instruction 
  to the jury on this issue.</p>
<p>
  [16] However, the appellant's mental state was also relevant to whether the 
  Crown had proven that the appellant had driven dangerously. On that issue, the 
  trial judge instructed the jury in this fashion: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Did Mr. Balcha operate the motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the 
  public? To decide whether Mr. Balcha operated the motor vehicle in a manner 
  that was dangerous to the public you have to consider all the circumstances 
  in which the driving occurred. Take into account but do not limit yourselves 
  to the evidence of the nature, condition and use of the place where the driving 
  occurred, the amount of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic actually there 
  at the time and the amount of both vehicular and pedestrian traffic that might 
  be reasonably expected to be there at the time. Dangerous operation of a motor 
  vehicle involves more than just carelessness. Crown counsel must satisfy you 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Balcha's driving was a marked departure from 
  what a reasonable, prudent driver would do in the same circumstances but you 
  have to decide in all the circumstances not what Mr. Balcha meant to do, but 
  rather, whether he drove in a manner that was a marked departure from the manner 
  in which a reasonable, prudent driver would drive in the same circumstances. 
  You must be satisfied that a reasonable person in similar circumstances should 
  have been aware of the risk and of the danger involved by Mr. Balcha's conduct. 
  I have previously reviewed the evidence of driving with you. You will have the 
  exhibits in your jury room. You will recall in the reconstruction exhibit there 
  is evidence concerning the angle of the road approaching the bridge, the position 
  of the road and the location of the sidewalk. You may wish to consider Mr. Balcha's 
  condition, what effect it may have on his driving to manoeuvre the road in the 
  area. He was bleeding and Ms. Osman was administering to his wound. If you are 
  not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Balcha operated the motor vehicle 
  in a manner that was dangerous to the public, you must find him not guilty. 
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [17] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in telling the jury that 
  it "may wish to consider Mr. Balcha's condition" in deciding whether 
  the Crown had proven the element of dangerousness. The appellant contends that 
  the jury should have been instructed that it was required to consider the appellant's 
  mental state on this issue.</p>
<p>
  [18] I disagree. In my view, a full and fair reading of the quoted passage establishes 
  that the jury would have understood its obligation to assess the appellant's 
  circumstances in deciding whether dangerousness had been proven beyond a reasonable 
  doubt. In the quoted passage, the trial judge directed the jury to consider 
  "a reasonable person in similar circumstances". He then went on to 
  enumerate the appellant's circumstances: "He was bleeding and Ms. Osman 
  was administering to his wound."</p>
<p>
  [19] It is true that the trial judge used the word 'may' rather than 'must'. 
  However, in jury cases, it is common for trial judges to use the word 'may' 
  when they are summarizing evidence that the jury should consider. It is a question 
  of style, even courtesy, which reflects the trial judge's previous instruction 
  that the jury is the sole fact finder in the trial. I do not think that the 
  use of 'may', in the context of the entire quoted passage, would convey to the 
  jury the impression that it could ignore the facts presented by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [20] The appellant also contends that the trial judge failed to make a clear 
  distinction between the burden of proof with respect to the defence of automatism 
  (balance of probabilities) and the Crown's burden of proof with respect to the 
  essential elements of the offence of dangerous driving causing bodily harm (beyond 
  a reasonable doubt).</p>
<p>
  [21] I disagree. The trial judge made a clear transition in his charge from 
  the defence of automatism to the elements of the offences of dangerous driving 
  and failing to stop at the scene of an accident. Almost at the outset of his 
  instruction on the latter, he said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If you conclude that the Crown has proven the elements with respect to each 
  count beyond a reasonable doubt you will find the accused guilty of that count 
  or counts. If you conclude that the Crown has not proven the elements with respect 
  to each count beyond a reasonable doubt you will find the accused not guilty 
  of that count or counts.</p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge gave a similar instruction in the component of his charge 
  concerning the element of dangerousness in the offence of dangerous driving 
  causing bodily harm. At the conclusion of his review of the evidence on this 
  issue, he said: "If you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that 
  Mr. Balcha operated the motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the 
  public, you must find him not guilty."</p>
<p>
  [23] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appellant's appeal against conviction.</p>
<p>
  The sentence appeal</p>
<p>
  (2) Intention as an aggravating factor</p>
<p>
  [24] In R. v. Hundal, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867, the Supreme Court of Canada held 
  that the mens rea for the offence of dangerous driving is based on a modified 
  objective test; an accused will be convicted if the Crown proves that, viewed 
  objectively, the accused was driving in a manner that was dangerous to the public, 
  having regard to all the circumstances. Accordingly, the offence of dangerous 
  driving potentially covers both intentional and unintentional conduct.</p>
<p>
  [25] In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge found as a fact that the appellant 
  had intentionally driven his car at the victim and his two friends: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Mr. Balcha and his girlfriend got into his motor vehicle and drove south on 
  Cherry Street in pursuit of the persons fleeing.</p>
<p class="center">
  . . . </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he factual scenario for the majority of dangerous driving causing bodily 
  harm situations are where an accident occurs and the driver does not seek to 
  harm anyone. In this case, Mr. Balcha pursued and upon catching up to the running 
  person, deliberately drove his car over him.</p>
<p class="center">
  . . . </p>
<p class="indent">
  The only conclusion one can realistically arrive at from the evidence is that 
  Mr. Balcha deliberately used his motor vehicle as a weapon to run down the person 
  fleeing.</p>
<p class="center">
  . . . </p>
<p class="indent">
  I have no doubt that the conduct was deliberate and it arose from rage and a 
  desire for revenge.</p>
<p>
  [26] The trial judge regarded the deliberateness of the appellant's conduct 
  as an aggravating factor and he took account of it when he imposed sentence: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I have no hesitation in saying a period of incarceration is required in this 
  case of driving which was most dangerous and deliberate and the victim was severely 
  injured.</p>
<p>
  He returned to the intentional aspect of the appellant's conduct when he rejected 
  the option of imposing a conditional sentence: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Mr. Balcha's moral culpability is simply too serious. The most important objective 
  is to deter people who take the law into their own hands and to make them aware 
  of the legal consequences should they choose to resort to this type of conduct.</p>
<p>
  [27] The appellant submits that, since the offence of dangerous driving does 
  not require subjective mens rea, the trial judge was not permitted to find that 
  the appellant's conduct was intentional or deliberate for the purposes of sentencing. 
  Given that subjective mens rea is not an element of the offence, in considering 
  the appellant's mental state the sentencing judge effectively imposed a sentence 
  on the appellant for a more serious crime - for example, aggravated assault, 
  assault with a weapon, or even attempted murder.</p>
<p>
  [28] I begin my analysis with several sentencing provisions of the Criminal 
  Code, R.S.C. 1985. c. C-46. Under the heading 'Fundamental Principle', s. 718.1 
  states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the 
  degree of responsibility of the offender. </p>
<p>
  [29] Section 718.2 provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the 
  following principles: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating 
  or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender&#133;. </p>
<p>
  [30] Section 724 provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> 724(1) In determining a sentence, a court may accept as proved 
  any information disclosed at the trial or at the sentence proceedings and any 
  facts agreed on by the prosecutor and the offender.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where the court is composed of a judge and jury, the court</p>
<p class="indent">(a) shall accept as proven all facts, express or implied, that 
  are essential to the jury's verdict of guilty; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) may find any other relevant fact that was disclosed by evidence 
  at the trial to be proven,&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Where there is a dispute with respect to any fact that is 
  relevant to the determination of a sentence, </p>
<p class="center">
  . . . </p>
<p class="indent">
  (e) the prosecutor must establish, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence 
  of any aggravating fact&#133;.</p>
<p>
  [31] These provisions, taken together, suggest that the trial judge was not 
  only entitled to consider factors relating to the appellant's mental state when 
  he drove the car and struck the victim; he was required to do so. The degree 
  of responsibility of the offender (s. 718.1) and aggravating circumstances relating 
  to the offender (s. 718.2(a)) necessarily inject moral blameworthiness into 
  the sentencing process. Moreover, the thrust of s. 724 is the search for truth 
  regarding the circumstances of the offence. In that context, where there is 
  evidence about the state of mind of the offender, it is difficult to see why 
  such evidence should be ignored.</p>
<p>
  [32] The appellant does not take issue with these general observations about 
  sentencing. However, he contends that they are inapplicable in this case for 
  two reasons: (1) there is case law which prohibits the sentencing judge from 
  finding facts that would constitute elements of a more serious crime than the 
  one for which an accused has been convicted; and (2) in the alternative, in 
  the particular circumstances of this case, it was unfair for the Crown to contend 
  at the sentence hearing that the appellant intentionally sought to run down 
  the victim and that the sentencing judge should regard this as an aggravating 
  factor. </p>
<p>
  [33] On the first point, the principal case relied on by the appellant is R. 
  v. Brown, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 518. In that case, the accused was charged with dangerous 
  driving causing death and dangerous driving causing bodily harm as a result 
  of a motor vehicle collision. At trial, it was argued by the Crown that the 
  accused was speeding and had driven through a red light and that this manner 
  of driving had caused the collision and resulted in death and injuries. The 
  defence argued that the manner of the accused's driving was not causally connected 
  to the collision or the death or injuries. The jury found the accused not guilty 
  of causing death or bodily harm by dangerous driving, but guilty of the included 
  offence of dangerous driving simpliciter.</p>
<p>
  [34] In imposing sentence, the trial judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Now in this case, under the jury, they found you guilty of dangerous driving 
  alone. And it's probably fortunate for you that they did. But the facts still 
  are that two people died as the result - or following that collision - following 
  that collision. And two others suffer injuries that they are still being treated 
  for today.</p>
<p>
  The trial judge imposed a sentence of one year imprisonment. A majority of the 
  Saskatchewan Court of Appeal upheld that sentence.</p>
<p>
  [35] The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal. The appellant argues that 
  Brown stands for the proposition that a sentencing judge may not adopt a view 
  of the facts that would justify a conviction for a more serious offence than 
  the one for which an accused has been convicted.</p>
<p>
  [36] I do not agree with the appellant's description of the ratio in Brown. 
  In my view, the holding in Brown is narrower. Brown stands for the proposition 
  that where the factual implication of a jury verdict is clear, a sentencing 
  judge cannot ignore or disagree with it. As expressed by Stevenson J. at pp. 
  523-24: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he correct principle [is] that the sentencer is bound by the express and 
  implied factual implications of the jury's verdict.</p>
<p class="center">
  . . . </p>
<p class="indent">
  The findings of dangerous driving, simpliciter, in the face of the more serious 
  charges leaves no room for speculation. The jury has negated the factor of causation. 
  This verdict was unambiguous and the trial judge was bound by it. So was the 
  Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>
  [37] The situation in the present case is different. The appellant here was 
  charged with a single driving offence and was convicted of that offence. In 
  contrast, in Brown the accused was acquitted of two of the three related offences.</p>
<p>
  [38] Moreover, in Brown the jury acquittals specifically removed certain facts 
  from consideration, namely, that the accused's driving caused death and bodily 
  harm. In the present case, the jury verdict of guilty did not resolve, or remove 
  from consideration, some issues that were relevant for sentencing purposes. 
  Specifically, because of the modified objective test for the mens rea element 
  of dangerous driving, the jury verdict did not have to - and did not in fact 
  - resolve whether the appellant's driving was intentional, as the Crown argued. 
  Since that issue was left unresolved, the trial judge was entitled to consider 
  whether the appellant's conduct was intentional (a factor relevant to his "degree 
  of responsibility" pursuant to s. 718.1) and to conclude that it was an 
  aggravating factor, provided that, pursuant to s. 724(3), he was satisfied beyond 
  a reasonable doubt of the existence of the fact. This is precisely what the 
  trial judge did.</p>
<p>
  [39] The appellant also relies on R. v. Doerksen (1990), 53 C.C.C. (3d) 509 
  (Man. C.A.). In that case, the accused was charged with impaired driving causing 
  death. Through a process of negotiation, the Crown agreed to accept a guilty 
  plea to the offence of impaired driving simpliciter, principally because the 
  victim had parked her car diagonally across the Trans-Canada Highway at night. 
  Crown counsel explained why the Crown had accepted a guilty plea to the lesser 
  charge: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The obvious sequential problem in terms of the impaired cause death was the 
  fact that the complainant had parked her car across the Trans-Canada Highway 
  at night.</p>
<p>
  [40] In spite of this acknowledgement, Crown counsel invited the trial judge 
  to take into account "the tragic circumstances" of the death when 
  imposing sentence. It is not clear from the report of the Manitoba Court of 
  Appeal decision whether the trial judge did this; however, he imposed a sentence 
  of twelve months imprisonment.</p>
<p>
  [41] The Manitoba Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and reduced the sentence 
  to four months. Both Twaddle J.A. for the majority and Monnin C.J.M., dissenting 
  in part, commented on the effect of the Crown's acceptance of the plea bargain. 
  Twaddle J.A. stated, at p. 518: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am of the view that only in exceptional circumstances should any offender 
  be spared the ignominy of a prison cell where his impaired driving caused bodily 
  harm or death. But this is not a case in which there was such a consequence. 
  The question before us is the fitness of a sentence of 12 months imprisonment 
  for impaired driving simpliciter.</p>
<p>
  [42] In a similar vein, Monnin C.J.M. said, at p. 511: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Crown counsel requested Corrin Prov. Ct. J. to take into account the fatality 
  which occurred. Because of the plea which was entered, in imposing a fit sentence 
  I am not free to take into consideration the fact a fatal accident resulted 
  from the impaired driving. Consequently, that death cannot be taken into account.</p>
<p>
  [43] The appellant contends that Doerksen also supports its core proposition 
  that a sentencing judge may not adopt a view of the facts that would justify 
  a conviction for a more serious offence than the one for which an accused has 
  been convicted.</p>
<p>
  [44] I disagree. In my view, Doerksen is similar to Brown in that something 
  happened during the progress of the case that explicitly removed certain facts 
  from the sentencing equation. In Brown, the jury acquittals on the more serious 
  offences removed 'causing death' and 'causing bodily harm' as potential facts 
  for the trial judge to consider when imposing sentence. In Doerksen, Crown counsel's 
  decision to drop the charge of impaired driving causing death and accept a plea 
  of guilty to impaired driving removed 'causing death' as a potential aggravating 
  factor at the sentencing stage. In short, it would be unfair to permit the Crown, 
  having explicitly dropped the charge in which 'causing death' is an essential 
  element of the offence, to resurrect the same fact for consideration at the 
  sentencing stage of the proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [45] The present case differs from Doerksen in a crucial respect. Throughout 
  the trial, the Crown took the position that the appellant deliberately drove 
  his car towards and struck the victim. The jury verdict neither affirms nor 
  denies this position. The Crown then advanced precisely the same argument at 
  the sentence hearing. In light of ss. 718.1, 718.2, 724(2) and 724(3) of the 
  Code, it was permitted to do so.</p>
<p>
  [46] The appellant advances an alternative argument on this issue. Doerksen 
  is a case in which the court held that it would have been unfair to permit the 
  Crown to advance a fact as being aggravating at the sentence hearing after taking 
  a formal step (accepting a plea) which removed the fact from the trial. In the 
  present case, the appellant advances an 'unfairness' argument. He submits that 
  since Crown counsel told the jury in his closing address that it could find 
  the accused guilty without concluding that he intentionally drove at and struck 
  the victim, it was unfair for Crown counsel to submit at the sentence hearing 
  that the accused's driving was intentional and should be considered as an aggravating 
  factor.</p>
<p>
  [47] In his closing jury address, Crown counsel said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  As you know, it is the Crown's theory here that Mr. Balcha deliberately drove 
  his car into Mr. Guaing from a motive of rage or anger after having been hit 
  in the forehead. However, you need not be convinced of that particular theory 
  in order to find him guilty of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. The Crown 
  need only prove here that Mr. Balcha drove in a manner that was dangerous to 
  the public having regard to all of the circumstances including the nature, condition 
  and use of the place and the amount of the traffic which might reasonably be 
  expected. Simply put, the position of the Crown is that driving a car onto a 
  sidewalk per se without going any further easily satisfies that definition of 
  dangerous driving. Roads are for cars. Sidewalks are for pedestrians. So whatever 
  Mr. Balcha's intent may have been, illogical as it was, whatever his intent 
  may be from the high point of hell bent on revenge to 'run over that guy who 
  I think hit me' to 'I'm just going to follow these guys because I'm mad. I want 
  to pursue them'. Whatever his intent may be his actions in driving the car in 
  that manner easily satisfies the definition of dangerous driving.</p>
<p>
  [48] I see nothing unfair in this portion of the Crown's jury address. He stated 
  candidly that the Crown's theory was that the accused deliberately drove into 
  the victim. However, he then pointed out, correctly, that the offence of dangerous 
  driving does not require subjective intention. On this latter point, Crown counsel 
  was merely anticipating the correct instruction (not challenged on this appeal) 
  that the trial judge later gave to the jury. In short, Crown counsel's position 
  at the sentence hearing about the intentional nature of the appellant's driving 
  was identical to the Crown position throughout the trial. Unlike Doerksen, it 
  was not unfair for the Crown to advance it at the sentence hearing.</p>
<p>
  [49] Before leaving this issue, I want to make one other observation. The general 
  proposition advanced by the appellant is that a sentencing judge may not adopt 
  a view of the facts which would justify a conviction for a more serious offence 
  than the one for which an accused has been convicted. I confess that, apart 
  from the fact that such a broad proposition is inconsistent with my reading 
  of ss. 718.1, 718.2, 724(2) and 724(3) of the Code, I have serious doubts, for 
  practical and policy reasons, about the desirability of the proposition, including 
  from the perspective of many accused persons.</p>
<p>
  [50] The reality is that many (probably most) of the offences in the Criminal 
  Code have elements which overlap with other offences. Examples include: (1) 
  first degree murder, second degree murder and manslaughter; (2) dangerous driving, 
  dangerous driving causing bodily harm, dangerous driving causing death, impaired 
  driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08; (3) assault, assault 
  causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, assault with intent to resist arrest, 
  assault of a peace officer, sexual assault and attempted murder; and (4) sexual 
  assault, indecency, sexual exploitation, sexual interference, sexual touching 
  and incest. Many other examples could be found in the Code. The fact of overlap 
  is especially prevalent with respect to offences that cover a wide range of 
  conduct. Dangerous driving is such an offence; it encompasses conduct with deliberately 
  intended consequences and conduct with unintended consequences.</p>
<p>
  [51] If the appellant's broad proposition were adopted, I am concerned that 
  one of the potential consequences might be an undesirable restriction of the 
  Crown's discretion to lay an appropriate charge. In the present case, possible 
  charges against the appellant included assault, dangerous driving, dangerous 
  driving causing bodily harm, assault with a weapon, aggravated assault and even 
  attempted murder. Several of these potential charges are more serious, in terms 
  of both potential penalties and current penalty ranges, than the charge the 
  Crown chose to lay - dangerous driving causing bodily harm. If the bright line 
  proposition advanced by the appellant were adopted and the Crown could not propose 
  certain facts as being aggravating at the sentence hearing because those facts 
  might constitute an element of a more serious offence, then the Crown might 
  be compelled to consider two other options: (1) charge the more serious offence 
  - in the present case, probably aggravated assault; or (2) charge all of the 
  possible offences, including attempted murder. In this case, the latter might 
  be the more likely possibility because dangerous driving is not an included 
  offence to aggravated assault or attempted murder.</p>
<p>
  [52] In my view, a general proposition which invites these possibilities is 
  undesirable. The Crown should be encouraged to lay a limited number of charges, 
  not to overcharge. As well, the Crown should be encouraged to lay an appropriate 
  charge in light of its assessment of all the relevant circumstances. Sometimes 
  those circumstances will suggest a charge for an offence less serious than other 
  possibilities. Perhaps the present case is an example; although the appellant's 
  conduct was blameworthy, there was the important mitigating factor that he had 
  been viciously assaulted shortly before he committed his crime.</p>
<p>
  [53] I conclude on this issue by returning to the words of the Code. Section 
  718.1 provides that a sentence must be proportionate to the degree of responsibility 
  of the offender. Section 718.2 states that a sentence should be increased to 
  account for any relevant aggravating circumstances relating to the offence or 
  the offender. Section 724(2) requires a sentencing judge to accept all facts 
  essential to a jury's verdict of guilty but permits the sentencing judge to 
  find other facts disclosed by evidence at the trial. Section 724(3) requires 
  the prosecutor to establish any disputed aggravating facts at the sentence hearing 
  beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [54] Read together, these provisions suggest that a sentencing judge is entitled 
  to consider all relevant factors in imposing sentence. One important factor 
  directly related to 'the degree of responsibility of the offender' is the accused 
  person's intention in committing the criminal act. In this case, the sentencing 
  judge was entitled to consider this factor, and label it aggravating. This is 
  what he did.</p>
<p>
  [55] There are exceptions to this general proposition. Brown is one example, 
  although 'exception' is perhaps not the right word. In my view, Brown is really 
  an affirmation of s. 724(2)(a) of the Code which requires the sentencing judge 
  to accept as proven all facts essential to the jury's verdict of guilty. A jury 
  verdict of guilty of dangerous driving, but not guilty of dangerous driving 
  causing bodily harm and dangerous driving causing death, constitutes a rejection 
  by the jury of the facts necessary to establish bodily harm and causing death. 
  Doerksen is a second exception; it posits that it is unfair for the Crown to 
  advance a fact at the sentence hearing that is specifically disclaimed in the 
  trial process. For the reasons set out above, the present case does not come 
  within either the Brown or Doerksen exceptions. There may well be other exceptions 
  - for example, a proposed aggravating factor that is a clear element of a higher 
  offence but at the perimeter of the range of conduct encompassed by the charged 
  offence - but none is suggested on the facts of this case.</p>
<p>
  (3) Unfit sentence</p>
<p>
  [56] The appellant contends that even if the trial judge was entitled to find 
  that he intentionally drove over the victim and treat this as an aggravating 
  factor, the sentence imposed was too harsh. In this submission, the appellant 
  attacks both the imposition of a custodial, as opposed to conditional, sentence 
  and the five year duration of the driving prohibition.</p>
<p>
  [57] In support of his submission that the trial judge erred in imposing a custodial 
  sentence, the appellant relies on three cases.</p>
<p>
  [58] In R. v. Areco (1999), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 255 (Ont. C.A.), the accused was 
  convicted of one count of dangerous driving causing death. The trial judge imposed 
  a custodial sentence of one year. This court allowed the appeal and converted 
  the remainder of the sentence to one served in the community.</p>
<p>
  [59] In R. v. Parker (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 236 (N.S.C.A.), the trial judge 
  imposed a conditional sentence of two years less a day for two counts of dangerous 
  driving causing death and two counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. 
  The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld this sentence.</p>
<p>
  [60] In R. v. Pawa (1998), 106 B.C.A.C. 296, the trial judge imposed a conditional 
  sentence of four months for dangerous driving causing death. The British Columbia 
  Court of Appeal increased the sentence to nine months but did not interfere 
  with the community locus for serving it.</p>
<p>
  [61] In my view, there is a fundamental difference between these cases and the 
  present appeal. In none of the cited cases did the accused intentionally drive 
  his car at the victim or victims. They were accidents caused by a want of attention 
  and/or skill that fell well below the standard of the reasonable driver.</p>
<p>
  [62] In this case, the appellant drove in search of three men, spotted them, 
  drove over the curb onto the sidewalk, and struck one of the men. He then backed 
  up the car and ran over the victim again. The victim was very seriously injured.</p>
<p>
  [63] The trial judge dealt fairly with the many mitigating factors that favoured 
  the appellant. However, in the end, he determined that the principles of general 
  deterrence and denunciation required a custodial sentence. I cannot say that 
  he erred in reaching this conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [64] With respect to the five year driving prohibition, the entirety of the 
  trial judge's analysis is contained in the last sentence of his reasons: "Further, 
  you, Mr. Balcha, will also be prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for 
  a period of five years." </p>
<p>
  [65] At the sentence hearing, the Crown offered no case law to support its submission 
  that a five year driving prohibition should be imposed. I have reviewed a substantial 
  number of driving prohibition cases. In very few have prohibitions of five years 
  or longer been ordered. Those cases usually involved terrible driving and the 
  death of a victim or victims.</p>
<p>
  [66] The appellant has worked hard to make a life for himself in Canada. He 
  contributes generously to his community. He committed no criminal offence before 
  this incident. He has a good job as a truck driver.</p>
<p>
  [67] In light of these circumstances, I think that a five year driving prohibition 
  is excessive. I would reduce it to one year.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [68] I would dismiss the conviction appeal. I would grant leave to appeal sentence. 
  I would dismiss the appeal with respect to the custodial portion of the sentence. 
  I would allow the appeal with respect to the driving prohibition and impose 
  a prohibition of one year.</p>
