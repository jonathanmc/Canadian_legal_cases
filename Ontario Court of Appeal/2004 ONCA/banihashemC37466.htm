<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Dennis Lane of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated November 30, 2001. </p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p class="indent">
  Nature of Appeal:</p>
<p class="indent">
  [1] This action arises out of a fire that occurred January 6, 1995, at the appellant's 
  premises, known as 2 Forest Laneway in the former City of North York. None of 
  those who stayed in their apartment were injured. Six people died and several 
  others were injured when they were overcome by smoke in the stairwells of the 
  apartment building. Nine actions were brought and were ordered tried together. 
  Lane J. heard the action that forms the subject matter of this appeal. The damages 
  in the other actions are somewhat in dispute and counsel have agreed to abide 
  by the result as to liability in this action. </p>
<p>[2] The trial judge gave thorough and detailed reasons. His diligence greatly 
  simplifies our task. The reasons are reported at [2001] O.J. No. 4720 and (2001), 
  24 M.L.P.R. (3d) 248. They include a detailed summary of the facts, which we 
  need not repeat. We will refer to the respondents (Zari Banihashem-Bakhtiari 
  and Pedrum Sodouri) as Zari and Pedrum respectively as this is how they are 
  referred to in the trial judgment.</p>
<p>[3] The Fire Marshall, William Hiscott, determined the cause of the fire to 
  be consistent with a cigarette burning on a couch in apartment 509, a unit rented 
  by the Defendant, Merv Doctorow. After discovering the fire, it appears that 
  Mr. Doctorow opened the balcony door, then exited his suite leaving the suite 
  door open. As the suite door was not equipped with a self-closing device (SCD), 
  the suite door remained open.</p>
<p>[4] The fire spread into the hallway and then into the stairwell. The plaintiffs 
  Zari and her son Pedrum were tenants on the 17th floor who fled their apartment 
  into the stairwell and eventually began climbing towards the roof. Several floors 
  above theirs they succumbed to smoke inhalation and were injured. </p>
<p>[5] Following a thirty-nine day trial without a jury, the trial judge awarded 
  damages in favour of the plaintiffs in the amount of $3,232,009.20. The defendants 
  Axes Investments Inc., the registered owner of 2 Forest Laneway, Tandem Group 
  Management Inc., the property managers (collectively, &#147;Axes&#148;), the 
  City of Toronto, successor to the former City of North York, and Mr. Doctorow 
  were all found to be negligent. The trial judge found as proven acts of negligence:</p>
<p class="indent">(i) Doctorow's careless handling of a cigarette caused the fire 
  and contributed to the injuries that ensued by leaving his suite and balcony 
  doors open.</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) When the building plans were put forward in 1974, the failure 
  of the City to require SCDs on all suites in accordance with its by-law was 
  an act of negligence for which it was liable.</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) Axes had a duty to take positive action to make its premises 
  reasonably safe when it first bought the premises in 1986. Further, it knew 
  or ought to have known of recent developments relating to fires in high rises 
  and to have placed SCDs on all suites.</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) Axes was negligent in failing to properly maintain the 
  SCD on the 5th floor stairwell door which would have ensured the door was closed 
  and latched and would not blow open at flashover by the wave of air pressure 
  generated at that time.</p>
<p>[6] He assessed the degree of fault among the respective defendants as follows: 
  Mr. Doctorow 10 percent; the City 20 percent; Axes 70 percent. In addition, 
  the trial judge awarded counsel fees to the plaintiffs on a substantial indemnity 
  scale at $1,120,000.00, plus a premium of $350,000.00 and disbursements of $193,402.00. 
  The trial judge also awarded costs to the co-defendant, City of Toronto, payable 
  by Axes, Paul Reid and Van Forbell, fixed at $85,000.00.</p>
<p>Issues on Appeal </p>
<p>
  [7] Only Axes appealed the issue of liability to Zari and Pedrum but, at the 
  outset of this appeal, Axes abandoned that issue. This appeal therefore relates 
  to the apportionment of liability, the quantum of general damages for the respondents, 
  future loss of income and the costs of the appeal. There is also a cross-appeal 
  with respect to two aspects of future care costs. In relation to the future 
  care costs of Zari, it was conceded that there was a mathematical error of $79,000 
  because the incorrect life expectancy factor had been used. Accordingly, subject 
  to what we say later, that amount shall be added to the judgment.</p>
<p>Apportionment of Liability</p>
<p>
  [8] We begin by acknowledging the narrow scope of appellate review in this area. 
  A re-apportionment of liability sought on appeal will only be granted in strong 
  and exceptional cases. </p>
<p>[9] The trial judge's reasons for apportioning the damages as he did are 
  summarized at para. 172 of his judgment and are reproduced below:</p>
<p class="indent">The defendant Merv Doctorow negligently allowed the fire to start. The Axes/Tandem 
  defendants were the occupiers and failed in their duty in the manner described 
  above. The City failed to properly interpret and enforce its own by-law. Each 
  of these acts or omissions contributed to the plaintiffs' injuries. In 
  considering the issue of the comparative negligence of each, I am struck by 
  the central role played by the absence of SCDs on the suite doors, and the failure 
  of the 5th floor fire stair door closer, aspects in which Mr. Doctorow played 
  no part; and by the open fire stair door in which neither Doctorow nor North 
  York played a role. The City's operative negligence occurred once, in the 
  process of approval of the plans over 20 years before the fire. The negligence 
  of Axes/Tandem went on for years as they failed to remove the risk which they 
  knew or ought to have known was created by the absence of these essential safety 
  devices, and failed to maintain the fire stair doors. They must bear the greater 
  part of the loss. </p>
<p>[10] With respect to Doctorow, as indicated, the trial judge held him 10 percent 
  liable. In coming to that conclusion he found at para. 15:</p>
<p class="indent">His careless handling of a cigarette caused the fire and so contributed to 
  the injuries and deaths which ensued. The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment 
  against him.</p>
<p>At para. 19 of his reasons, the trial judge quoted from the report of Mr. Hiscott 
  as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">Due to the actions of the occupant opening the patio door and leaving the suite 
  door open, the fire burned freely consuming most of the combustibles contained 
  in the couch.</p>
<p>Further, at para. 22:</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Robert Harpur P. Eng., also from the OFM, holds a degree in engineering 
  and has been in fire protection work since 1978. He has studied smoke movement 
  and smoke control design and has investigated many fires. He was qualified as 
  an expert. His evidence was also essentially uncontradicted and I accept it. 
  He performed fire resistance tests on a typical suite door from 2 Forest Laneway 
  and found that, although it burned through to the extent of a 60 mm. hole in 
  13 minutes, less time than permitted under 1995 standards to be rated for fire 
  resistance, it nevertheless: &#147;...remained essentially intact and in place 
  and would have presented a useful barrier against the spread of fire and smoke 
  in an actual fire.&#148; (Report, Ex. 13, vol. 1, p.212). Of course, it would 
  have had to have been closed to perform such a function.</p>
<p>In a later portion of his reasons, at para. 117, the trial judge stated:</p>
<p class="indent">If the suite door to 509 had been closed it would have at least been a useful 
  barrier against the spread of the fire and smoke; indeed, Mr. Hiscott and Mr. 
  Silvestri felt that they would have been confined to 509 itself. Had that been 
  the case, there would likely have been no injuries or fatalities from smoke. 
</p>
<p>[11] It is apparent that this finding applies equally to Mr. Doctorow. He was 
  not only the instigator of the fire but had he also shut the door in accordance 
  with signs posted throughout the apartment building directing tenants to do 
  so, the smoke would have been confined to his unit. It does not appear that 
  the trial judge took this into account in apportioning liability. Accordingly 
  we are of the opinion that Mr. Doctorow's liability should have been higher. 
</p>
<p>[12] We turn now to the issue of whether the trial judge erred in his apportionment 
  of liability with respect to the City. In assessing the City's apportionment, 
  the trial judge found at para. 172 that the City's operative negligence 
  occurred once &#147;in the process of approval of the plans over 20 years before 
  the fire.&#148; The trial judge specifically held at para. 116 that &#147;Bylaw 
  22000 required that 2 Forest Laneway be equipped with SCDs on all suite doors.&#148; 
  The trial judge properly found that the City failed to correctly interpret and 
  enforce its own by-law in approving the plans without SCDs on all suite doors. 
  With respect, however, we think that the trial judge erred in restricting the 
  City's negligence to that one event.</p>
<p>[13] Leaving aside the fact that the City apparently failed to enforce its 
  by-law, the City certainly had an opportunity to rectify the lack of SCDs on 
  suite doors in 1994 when Axes applied for an extension of time to retrofit the 
  building in accordance with the provincial Fire Code. Mr. Cleary, the City's 
  representative in charge of deciding on applications for an extension:</p>
<p class="indent">acknowledged that he knew that heat and smoke are two products of combustion; 
  that in high-rise fires, smoke is the primary cause of injuries and death; that 
  he was aware that a feature of fires in high-rise buildings is the stack effect, 
  and the consequent migration of smoke; that in 1994 he knew what a self closing 
  device was, that its purpose was to return the door to the closed position and 
  that keeping a door to a suite in the closed position was &#147;...an important 
  part of fire safety.&#148; [at para. 146]</p>
<p>Despite this, Mr. Cleary approved Axes' application for an extension of 
  time to retrofit the building including time to install SCDs on suite doors. 
  He did this solely on grounds of financial hardship. The trial judge found at 
  para. 149:</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Cleary reached a decision which is supportable upon the financial criteria 
  recommended by the Fire Marshall's October, 1992, circular. It was entirely 
  reasonable for Mr. Cleary to have relied upon the criteria recommended by the 
  OFM in that circular.</p>
<p>[14] In our opinion, while this may have applied to the rest of the retrofit, 
  in view of By-Law 22000 and the public knowledge of the serious risk created 
  by the lack of SCDs in high-rise apartments, he ought not to have done so. The 
  trial judge alluded to this public knowledge and great danger at paras. 67-69 
  and 82 of his judgment in discussing the liability of Axes as owner of the building. 
  However, he made no reference to the City and in our view his conclusion is 
  also applicable to the City. The City missed the opportunity to rectify the 
  situation and, in light of the trial judge's findings concerning the closure 
  of the suite door, this had to be a significant factor in the tragic outcome. 
  Accordingly we are of the view that the trial judge underestimated the City's 
  liability.</p>
<p>[15] Axes further submits that the trial judge also underestimated the City's 
  liability when he found that, although Chief Hudson was negligent in failing 
  to use the Emergency Voice Communication System (EVAC), that negligence did 
  not cause or contribute to the plaintiffs' injuries. Axes submits that 
  had Chief Hudson looked at the annunciator panel upon his arrival, he would 
  have seen that the smoke detectors were going off in the stairwells and, using 
  the EVAC system, advised tenants to stay in their apartments or to return to 
  their apartments. </p>
<p>[16] We would not give effect to this submission. We note that there was no 
  evidence that Chief Hudson was negligent because he may not have gone immediately 
  to the annunciator panel. He was concerned with deploying his forces to fight 
  the fire and putting in a second alarm. The trial judge found that Chief Hudson's 
  duty to communicate with the tenants by using the EVAC system did not arise 
  until 5:24 a.m., at which time in all probability the EVAC system had shorted 
  out and was not operational. He also found that it was &#147;very probable&#148; 
  that the plaintiffs had left their apartment before the Fire Department arrived. 
  Moreover, he found (at para. 166) that smoke probably overcame the plaintiffs 
  between 5:20 and 5:25 a.m. and it was &#147;most improbable&#148; that even 
  &#147;perfect communication&#148; would have assisted them since they were trapped 
  on the thirtieth floor &#147;13 smoke-filled floors away from their apartment.&#148; 
</p>
<p>[17] Returning to the question of apportionment, Axes' overall submission 
  is that its liability should not be greater than that of the City. The trial 
  judge found the negligence of Axes went on for years. It included not only its 
  failure as owner and occupier of the Building to install SCDs on all suite doors 
  but also its failure to maintain SCDs that had been installed on the fire exit 
  doors leading to the stairwells. In respect of the latter finding, the trial 
  judge found that it was &#147;the single greatest contributor to the whole disaster&#148; 
  (at para. 62). While that finding may be questionable in light of the trial 
  judge's findings regarding the importance of SCDs in each unit, we nonetheless 
  consider it appropriate that Axes assume a greater portion of the liability. 
</p>
<p>[18] Based on the foregoing analysis, we are of the view that the trial judge 
  erred in his apportionment of liability for negligence. Taking into account 
  the full extent of the responsibility of Mr. Doctorow and the City, we are of 
  the view that liability should be apportioned as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">Doctorow: 20%</p>
<p class="indent">North York: 35%</p>
<p class="indent">Axes: 45%</p>
<p>General Damages</p>
<p>
  [19] The only issue with respect to Zari is the award for non-pecuniary general 
  damages. In oral argument, Axes abandoned its appeal respecting future care 
  costs. </p>
<p>[20] Zari suffered severe injuries due to smoke inhalation when she was trapped 
  in the stairwell. She has permanent organic brain damage. The trial judge summarized 
  the nature and extent of her injuries at para. 247 of his reasons as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, the quality of Zari's life has been destroyed. She has been 
  reduced from an independent, respected, confident, self-supporting, employed 
  mother of two sons who looked to her for guidance, to an unemployable, unsociable, 
  dependent person, no longer able to be the mother, rather now dependent upon 
  her sons for her emotional support. Once she has done her banking and her shopping, 
  she has no activities to stimulate her socially or cognitively. She does not 
  travel for pleasure. Her course is a correspondence course, lacking in the give 
  and take of a classroom. Her short-term memory is so bad she often has to re-play 
  movies to pick up the plot. She has a similar problem when reading. She has 
  reasonable health, except for her shoulder and neck pain (for which she goes 
  to the gym occasionally) and a normal life expectancy, but she has severe cognitive 
  deficits. It is true that she is in a better situation as to health than any 
  of the trilogy plaintiffs. Nevertheless, the result of her injuries has devastated 
  her former life. She has a reasonable possibility of coming to dementia earlier 
  than she would have. Such a plaintiff is a candidate for an award towards the 
  upper end of the scale: MacMillan v. Ontario, [1998] O.J. No. 2763 (O.C.J.)</p>
<p>[21] In MacMillan v. Ontario, Jenkins J. assessed the plaintiff's damages 
  at $210,000 in respect of injuries that were similar to the injuries sustained 
  by Zari in this case. An appellate court is not justified in interfering with 
  the trial judge's assessment of damages unless the amount awarded is either 
  so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous 
  estimate of the damage. While the award here may have been at the high end of 
  the appropriate range, we are not prepared to interfere. The trial judge's 
  findings of fact are reasonably capable of supporting the amount awarded. See: 
  Padfield et al. v. Martin et al. (2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 577 (Ont. C.A.) at 592. 
  In coming to this conclusion we note that in oral argument Axes abandoned its 
  position that the trial judge had erred in finding that Zari had a reasonable 
  possibility of suffering early dementia. That factor, which played a role in 
  the assessment of future care costs, is also significant with respect to the 
  assessment of general damages.</p>
<p>[22] Pedrum was awarded $100,000 in non-pecuniary general damages. In arriving 
  at that award the trial judge found at para. 276 of his reasons:</p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion the weight of the medical evidence &#150; Drs. Butler, Cancelliere, 
  Upton and Weber and to some extent Dr. Travis and also Dr. Stewart in cross-examination 
  &#150; supports the view that Pedrum has suffered permanent, although mild, 
  cognitive deficits as a result of the fire in which he experienced 10% CO poisoning, 
  a significant period of hypoxia and smoke inhalation, all of which contributed 
  to his impairment. There is a possibility, which I regard as a real possibility, 
  in the order of 10%, that at some future time he may experience some degree 
  of dementia perhaps five years earlier than would have been the case absent 
  the fire. He almost certainly retains sufficient intellectual capacity to achieve 
  an engineering degree, but his career may suffer. He will actually never know. 
  I deal elsewhere with the economic consequences of that, but this is the place 
  to consider the frustrations engendered by it. Apart from intellectual function, 
  the emotional/psychological consequences of the fire for him have been severe, 
  altering his personality, restricting his ability to engage in a full social 
  life and burdening him with chronic anxiety and emotional constriction. In considering 
  the quantum of general damages, I also must recall the experiences of the day 
  itself, apart from the sequelae: the terror, the pain and suffering of the hospital 
  stay and the immediate as well as long term disruption of his life. I assess 
  his general damages at $100,000.</p>
<p>[23] Not unlike the situation with Zari, the findings of the trial judge were 
  reasonable, and, while the award may be at the high end of the range, we are 
  not prepared to interfere.</p>
<p>Future loss of income</p>
<p>
  [24] The trial judge awarded Pedrum $250,000 for future loss of income. In doing 
  so, he took into account the medical evidence that showed that Pedrum suffered 
  from cognitive impairment and that there was a realistic possibility that he 
  too would suffer from early dementia. He also found that there was a real possibility 
  that his career as an engineer could be significantly affected. Over a lifetime 
  of work, and given the nature of his occupation, this amount is not unreasonable. 
  We are unable to find any error in the trial judge's assessment of this 
  head of damages.</p>
<p>[25] For these reasons the appeal by Axes respecting damages is dismissed. 
</p>
<p>The Cross-Appeal on damages </p>
<p>
  [26] In his initial set of reasons, the trial judge found that Zari would &#147;clearly 
  benefit today from the services available in a setting which left her free to 
  come and go, but assisted her with activation programs and had therapeutic modalities 
  as well&#148; (at para. 231). He also found that Zari's &#147;quality of 
  life would be greatly enhanced by the social activation and rehabilitative opportunities 
  available in the proper setting. Indeed, this is the only way to compensate 
  her for the loss of her former life. The debate in the trial over the specific 
  sites&#133;surely did not cover all possibilities&#148; (at para. 231). </p>
<p>[27] Although he had tables of costs in the future care consultant's report 
  relating to Zari overcoming various disabilities, a revision was put in during 
  the evidence and it was agreed that these figures would need to be redone after 
  the trial judge's findings were available. In this context the trial judge 
  also recognized the possibility that Zari might resist the semi-institutional 
  setting that was being suggested and that this was a contingency to be taken 
  into account in fixing the final award. After the release of his November 30 
  reasons, the trial judge met with the parties and asked counsel for Zari to 
  advise him whether Zari wished to enter a semi-institutional setting or to live 
  independently with assistance. Counsel for the plaintiffs objected on the basis 
  that the question was not relevant having regard to the trial judge's earlier 
  finding. The trial judge declined to give effect to this objection. They then 
  complied with the trial judge's request and reported that she wanted to 
  live on her own. </p>
<p>[28] Zari submits that the trial judge erred in asking for this information. 
  The trial judge was alive to this submission. At para. 4 of his supplementary 
  reasons (reported at [2003] O.J. No. 158), he stated:</p>
<p class="indent">Counsel for Zari submits that there is no &#147;contingency&#148; to be applied 
  to the future care costs on the basis that Zari will resist an institutional 
  setting; rather it is an issue of causation. The Court has already found that 
  the negligence of the defendants caused the injuries to Zari and that &#147;her 
  present condition derived from the fire sufficed to make this kind of care reasonable 
  now&#148; (para. 231, November 30, 2001 Reasons). Further the Court has found 
  that this is the only way to compensate her for the loss of her former life. 
  The plaintiffs submit that whether and how Zari may use the amounts awarded 
  to her for the value of future care costs is irrelevant to the award and cannot 
  be relied on by the defendants to attempt to reduce the award in a fault based 
  system. Reference is made to Andrews v. Grand &amp; Toy Alberta Ltd., (1978) 
  83 D.L.R. (3rd) 452 at 466 (S.C.C.) where the Supreme Court observed that it 
  was not for the court to conjecture how a plaintiff will actually spend the 
  sums awarded to him after they have been awarded. </p>
<p>[29] As the trial judge observed, the choice in Andrews was between home care 
  and the less expensive institutional care. The Supreme Court held that the setting 
  that was the more advantageous to the plaintiff should be awarded. The trial 
  judge then went on at para. 8 of his supplementary reasons to distinguish the 
  present case as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion, it is not reasonable to base an award to Zari on the cost of 
  a type of care which would help her, but which she will not use. While Ms. Whitham 
  and the court thought it reasonable that she would be helped by living in such 
  an environment even now, the choice must be hers, and she has made it. It is 
  the mirror image of Andrews. Here, the plaintiff claims to live independently 
  which may or may not be the less expensive choice. Ms. Whitham's letter 
  of January 9, 2002, (Ex. 98, tab 8) suggests that it will in fact be more costly, 
  but other evidence is to the contrary. For my purposes, it does not matter. 
  The point is not that Zari must mitigate her loss by accepting a lesser standard 
  of care, there is no such requirement on an injured plaintiff. The point is 
  rather that, faced with two reasonable possibilities for her immediate living 
  arrangements, she has chosen to remain in her own home independently. Therefore, 
  the costs of her future care while she remains in her own home should be the 
  basis upon which the award for the next several years to perhaps age 57 is based. 
  Thereafter, the impact of Dr. Upton's estimate of a 10-20% chance of premature 
  need for assisted housing must be considered and then a reasonable schedule 
  for moving towards the full costs of such housing as Zari ages.</p>
<p>[30] The trial judge did not misinterpret Andrews. The issue of where Zari 
  would live was left open in his November 30 reasons and the trial judge made 
  it clear that before deciding the matter he needed to have further evidence. 
  Having received that evidence, he was entitled to take Zari's express wishes 
  into account in awarding the future care costs he did. In so doing he was not 
  departing from the principle of full compensation enunciated in Andrews. </p>
<p>[31] Accordingly, the cross-appeal is dismissed. </p>
<p>Costs at trial</p>
<p>
  The plaintiffs' costs </p>
<p>
  [32] The trial judge awarded the respondents their costs on a substantial indemnity 
  basis fixed at $1,470,000 plus disbursements. This figure of nearly $1.5 million 
  included a premium of $350,000 (the trial judge's endorsement as to costs 
  is reported at (2003), 66 O.R. (3d) 284). </p>
<p>[33] There were two offers to settle made by the respondents which the trial 
  judge found did not meet the requirements of rule 49.10(1) of the Rules of Civil 
  Procedure R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194. The second offer made by the respondents was 
  extremely close to the amount awarded by the trial judge. Counsel for the respondents 
  submitted at trial that, given that the second offer was a &#147;near miss&#148; 
  in respect to engaging rule 49.10(1), the trial judge should exercise his discretion 
  to award substantial indemnity costs under rule 49.13. However, the trial judge 
  found that his discretionary power under rule 49.13 did not extend to a case 
  where the respondent's offer was greater than the recovery.</p>
<p>[34] The trial judge then considered whether the conduct of the defendants 
  in this action provided a basis upon which he could order substantial indemnity 
  costs apart from Rule 49. He reviewed a number of factors which included:</p>
<p class="indent">(i) the failure of the appellants to respond to the respon-dents' 
  attempts to settle;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the failure to admit any liability at all;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the failure to respond in a timely way to requests for 
  advance payments to assist in Zari's rehabilitation; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) the failure to admit in a timely fashion that Zari would 
  never return to work.</p>
<p>[35] It is clear that the failure of the appellant to admit liability at an 
  early stage was a dominant factor in the trial judge's consideration. He 
  stated at paras. 18 and 19 of his costs endorsement:</p>
<p class="indent">Taking the three defendants, Axes, the tenant and the City, 
  as a group, it is obvious that there was no defence to the plaintiffs' claims. 
  The plaintiffs were entirely innocent; at the very worst they might have conceivably 
  been open to a modest percentage of contributory negligence for leaving the 
  apartment, but that is stretching matters. The tenant did not defend and he 
  was thought to be uninsured. Nothing could realistically be expected from him 
  if he was solely liable. But, at least after the inquest, it was, or ought to 
  have been, clear that the owners would be liable for something because the rapid 
  spread of the smoke was only possible due to the open fire door at the 5th floor 
  stairwell. These doors are required to close automatically and this one clearly 
  did not. That the owner could escape without any contribution at all was a known 
  impossibility on that fact alone. The view of the Axes defendants may be judged 
  by the fact that they called no evidence in their own defence. The obvious inference 
  is that they knew they could not defend their maintenance practices. The City's 
  liability was somewhat more problematic, although, despite its protestations 
  of being &#145;ambushed', it ought to have known from early days that it was 
  seriously exposed on the issuance of the permit. The strange saga of Mr. Mori 
  and the memo gives credence to the view that the City did indeed know it was 
  exposed.</p>
<p class="indent">The conduct of defendants who have no arguable case against 
  the plaintiff but nevertheless insist on a protracted trial has been criticized, 
  and substantial indemnity costs awarded on several occasions. The plaintiffs 
  referred to [Dube v. Penlon Ltd. (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 190 (O.C.G.D.)] where 
  Zuber J. fixed solicitor and client costs because it should have been obvious 
  that the plaintiff, catastrophically injured by an overdose of anaesthetic, 
  was blameless and liability rested with one or more of the defendants. That 
  decision has been referred to at least twice in subsequent cases in the Court 
  of Appeal as an exercise of discretion, and not a rule of law, but without criticism 
  of it as the former. The present action is on all fours with the footnoted cases 
  under review: the plaintiff Zari was catastrophically injured in circumstances 
  where she could not be liable, and those who were potentially liable were all 
  sued. The real fight was among them as to their shares of the liability to the 
  plaintiff. The Axes defendants in particular, by refusing to admit any liability, 
  put the plaintiffs to the prolonged and unnecessary task of proving their liability, 
  which the plaintiffs duly did on the precise basis foreshadowed by the testimony 
  at the Inquest and known to the defendants from the outset. This conduct strongly 
  supports the request of the plaintiffs for substantial indemnity costs.</p>
<p>[36] The appellants submit that this is not a case for an award of costs on 
  a substantial indemnity basis. They assert that the trial judge complimented 
  all counsel, including counsel for the appellants, at the end of the trial on 
  their professional and courteous conduct throughout the trial. This is also 
  reflected in the trial judge's conclusion to his costs endorsement, at 
  para. 99:</p>
<p class="indent">The trial began over two and one-half years ago, on January 8, 2001. From that 
  day to this, I have been the beneficiary of the assistance of some of the finest 
  counsel in the Province. I am grateful to them all.</p>
<p>[37] It should be noted that the trial judge, when referring to the conduct 
  of the appellants, was not referring to their solicitors. His comments were 
  confined to their clients and those who instructed them.</p>
<p>[38] The appellants further attack the costs award on the basis that it is 
  inconsistent in the sense that if the liability portion of the case was clear 
  from the outset this is not a case for a substantial indemnity costs award and 
  a premium. However, the trial judge pointed out that the preparation involved 
  complex evidence as to the spread of the fire and especially the smoke movement 
  within the building; the relationship of the Building Code violations to the 
  events; the study and understanding of Fire Department procedures; all of which 
  required many days of investigation. (Because the appellants' did not admit 
  liability, it was necessary for the plaintiffs to lead this evidence which would 
  otherwise have related to the apportionment of liability as between Axes and 
  the City). The trial judge also concluded that this was a catastrophic injury 
  case which was complex medically and in relation to damages &#150; particularly 
  in relation to the cost of future care. Further, there was a significant issue 
  on the question of the early onset of dementia and whether it could be triggered 
  by an incident of hypoxia, or whether it was essentially assigned to patients 
  with repeated blows to the head, such as boxers. </p>
<p>[39] Counsel for the respondents sought a premium on the award of costs on 
  more or less the same basis upon which they had sought costs to be fixed on 
  a substantial indemnity scale: success, the indifference of the appellants to 
  the plight of Zari; failure to accept the realities of the case and their lack 
  of a defence. In addition, they premised their claim for a premium upon the 
  following written submission at trial:</p>
<p class="indent">It is submitted that this is one of those cases where the Plaintiffs lack the 
  resources to fund a lengthy complex trial, but it is a case which, in the interest 
  of justice, ought to have proceeded and competent and skilled counsel must continue 
  to take on the challenge and continue to step forward and accept such cases.</p>
<p>Further:</p>
<p class="indent">The Plaintiff's counsel fees remain unpaid to date from 1995 to the present. 
  The work in process has therefore been carried for over eight years with substantial 
  amounts expended for disbursements by counsel. The Plaintiffs' law firm 
  in effect has been the direct lender to the defendants. The work in process 
  has a value in excess of $1,000,000.00. The actual cost to the Plaintiff's 
  law firm is its cost of carrying that value is in excess of $350,000.00. It 
  is submitted the defendants should pay a premium of $350,000.00 for this burden 
  of the Plaintiffs and their counsel and for the privilege of conducting the 
  litigation in the manner they did. The defendant Axes/Tandem has filed a Notice 
  of Appeal on both liability and damages. The defendant City shelters under the 
  damages appeal. Not only are the Plaintiffs' lawyers' fees unpaid 
  to date, but there is a real prospect that the plaintiffs will not collect any 
  of their costs until after all appeals available to the defendants are exhausted.</p>
<p>[40] When considering the premium issue, the trial judge made the following 
  observations at paras 32 and 34:</p>
<p class="indent">The defendants submitted that the plaintiffs could not have 
  it both ways. Having complained of the failure of the defendants to admit liability 
  when it was a non-issue, they cannot now claim a premium for their great risk 
  of non-recovery. The plaintiffs respond that the defendants insisted in keeping 
  the issue alive and so must bear the cost of that decision. In my view, the 
  risk kept alive by the defendants' failure to admit liability was not so great 
  that it alone justifies a premium, but there is another factor: the need to 
  encourage counsel to provide access to justice for the impecunious plaintiff 
  by assuming the risk of delayed as well as possible non-payment.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, the delay in payment for eight years with possibly 
  two or more years to come as the appeal process continues, is a risk that was 
  assumed by counsel for the plaintiffs in fulfillment of the duty to provide 
  access to justice for the legitimate claims of impecunious parties. Combined 
  with the uncertainty so long as liability was not admitted, it is a basis for 
  a premium to recognize the very real cost of carrying the plaintiffs for that 
  time. I am therefore of the view that a premium is called for. The plaintiffs 
  seek $350,000 as an estimate of the real value of the service of carrying the 
  plaintiffs for so long.</p>
<p>[41] There is no question that the costs award in this case is generous. However, 
  with two exceptions, we see no basis for interfering with the trial judge's 
  award of costs. </p>
<p>[42] Our first point of disagreement with the trial judge is in his award of 
  costs in respect to a separate action against certain doctors and the hospital 
  in which Zari was treated. The appellants were not parties to that action. The 
  trial judge's reasoning in awarding these costs is to be found at paragraph 
  43 of his endorsement:</p>
<p class="indent">The plaintiffs brought an action against certain doctors and the hospital in 
  which Zari was treated. It was held in abeyance and was dismissed when this 
  action was completed. In my view, such an action was a necessary precaution 
  to be taken by counsel for the plaintiffs to protect the clients' interests. 
  That it was not dismissed until 2002 may well be related to the failure of the 
  Axes defendants to admit liability. I think it was both reasonable and necessary 
  and I will allow these charges.</p>
<p>[43] In our view, there is no proper basis for awarding costs against the appellants 
  when they were not parties to the medical malpractice action. The trial judge 
  suggests that perhaps the reason for not dismissing the action until 2002 may 
  be related to the failure of the respondents to admit liability. He does not 
  elaborate. While no doubt the medical malpractice action may have been a necessary 
  precaution taken by counsel for the respondents, it is not a precaution that 
  should be financed by the appellants. </p>
<p>[44] The second point of disagreement with the trial judge involves the award 
  of substantial indemnity costs in respect to respondents' counsel appearing 
  at the inquest related to the fire. Although we accept the rationale for an 
  award of substantial indemnity costs insofar as it relates to the action itself, 
  we do not agree that the factors considered by the trial judge in arriving at 
  his conclusion in regard to the scale of costs in this action have anything 
  to do with the inquest. There is no suggestion that the conduct of the appellants 
  at the inquest in any way prejudiced the respondents. The costs of counsel appearing 
  at the inquest should be on a partial indemnity basis.</p>
<p>[45] We would therefore grant leave to appeal the trial judge's costs 
  order, but dismiss the appeal except with respect to the medical malpractice 
  action and the costs of the inquest.</p>
<p>Costs as between the defendants</p>
<p>[46] Counsel for the City made a settlement offer to the appellants based on 
  the assumption that all defendants would be found liable and that they would 
  end up paying Mr. Doctorow's share as he was impecunious. The proposal 
  assumed a 3:1 ratio between the appellants and the City after Mr. Doctorow's 
  share was rateably apportioned so that the appellants would pay 75% and the 
  City 25% of the damages. Costs, interest and any assignment of the judgment 
  against Mr. Doctorow would be similarly treated. This offer was made pursuant 
  to rule 49.12(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. </p>
<p>[47] The trial judge concluded that when the judgment was compared with the 
  City's offer, the City had bettered its offer to absorb 25% of the damages.</p>
<p>[48] The trial judge awarded the City its costs payable by the appellants from 
  seven days after the offer was made for those costs associated with the continuation 
  of the liability portion of the trial. He fixed the costs on a partial indemnity 
  basis in the amount of $85,000. </p>
<p>[49] As a result of the re-apportionment of the liability share on this appeal, 
  the City no longer can be considered to have bettered its offer. We therefore 
  give leave to appeal this costs order and allow the appeal by vacating the said 
  order.</p>
<p>Costs of the appeal</p>
<p>
  [50] If the parties cannot agree on the costs of the appeal, they shall have 
  ten days from the release date of these reasons to deliver written submission, 
  not to exceed five pages in length double-spaced, along with their bills of 
  costs and any other relevant documentation. </p>
<p>[51] With respect to the differential between the costs for the inquest (varied 
  from substantial to partial indemnity), if the parties cannot agree on the amount 
  of the differential, they may deliver further written submissions within ten 
  days of the release date of these reasons. Said submission shall not exceed 
  two pages double-spaced.</p>
