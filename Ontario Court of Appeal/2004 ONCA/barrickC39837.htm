<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Katherine Swinton of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated March 12, 2003, on a motion for default judgment.</p>
<p>
  R.A. BLAIR J.A.: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Internet represents a communications revolution. It makes 
  instantaneous global communication available cheaply to anyone with a computer 
  and an Internet connection. It enables individuals, institutions, and companies 
  to communicate with a potentially vast global audience. It is a medium which 
  does not respect geographical boundaries. Concomitant with the utopian possibility 
  of creating virtual communities, enabling aspects of identity to be explored, 
  and heralding a new and global age of free speech and democracy, the Internet 
  is also potentially a medium of virtually limitless international defamation 
  [emphasis added].<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a></p>
<p>
  [1] The issues on this appeal concern the damages that may be awarded in Internet 
  defamation cases, and whether the remedy of injunctive relief should be granted 
  in such circumstances.</p>
<p>
  INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [2] Jorge Lopehandia has a grievance against Barrick Gold Corporation. The grievance 
  emerges from a claim he asserts regarding one of Barrick's mining properties 
  in Chile, known as the Pascua Lama project. Barrick insists that the grievance 
  is unfounded.</p>
<p>
  [3] Following Barrick's refusal to settle the complaint in 2001, Mr. Lopehandia 
  embarked upon what counsel for the appellant has accurately described as "a 
  systematic, extensive and vicious campaign of libel . . . over an extraordinarily 
  lengthy period " with the express purpose and intent of embarrassing Barrick 
  and injuring its reputation. This campaign was conducted over the Internet, 
  and involved the posting of hundreds of false and defamatory statements concerning 
  Barrick on various websites.</p>
<p>
  [4] Barrick served a libel notice on October 8, 2002, after learning about the 
  extent of the Internet campaign earlier that year. The campaign continued. Barrick 
  served its statement of claim on October 31, 2002. Unrepentant, Mr. Lopehandia 
  continued his campaign even more defiantly. Neither he nor his company defended 
  the action, however, and the defendants were noted in default. On March 12, 
  2003, after a motion for default judgment, Swinton J. granted judgment, finding 
  that the impugned statements were defamatory and awarding general damages for 
  injury to Barrick's reputation in the amount of $15,000. She dismissed the claim 
  for punitive damages and for injunctive relief.</p>
<p>
  [5] Barrick appeals the quantum of general damages awarded and the refusal to 
  award any punitive damages or grant injunctive relief. I would allow the appeal 
  for the reasons that follow.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [6] Barrick is one of the largest producers of gold in the world. It has operating 
  mines and development projects in Canada, the United States, Peru, Argentina, 
  Tanzania, Australia, and Chile. It is incorporated pursuant to the laws of Ontario 
  and has its head office in Toronto, Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [7] Barrick's shares are widely held. They trade under the ticker symbol "ABX" 
  on the Toronto, New York, London and Swiss Stock Exchanges and the Paris Bourse.</p>
<p>
  [8] Mr. Lopehandia is a businessman who resides in North Vancouver, British 
  Columbia. He is an officer and director, and the directing mind of the defendant 
  Chile Mineral Fields Canada Ltd., a British Columbia corporation with head offices 
  in Vancouver and purporting to deal in precious-base metals and strategic minerals. 
  It is a deemed fact in this case that the actions of Mr. Lopehandia at issue 
  in the proceeding were undertaken by him in his personal capacity and in his 
  capacity as an officer, director and representative of CMFCL.</p>
<p>
  [9] Barrick obtained its interest in the Pascua Lama Project in 1994. Through 
  a Chilean subsidiary it also acquired mining claims near the Project, known 
  as the "Amarillo Claims", from two individuals named Rodolfo Villar 
  Garcia ("Villar") and Alejandro Moreno ("Moreno"). The Pascua 
  Lama Project is an important Barrick holding as its estimated gold reserves 
  represent approximately 25% of Barrick's worldwide gold reserves.</p>
<p>
  [10] In January 2001, Barrick received a letter from Mr. Lopehandia claiming 
  that he and three other individuals (including Villar) were the beneficial owners 
  of the Amarillo Claims and that the Pascua Lama Project had been fraudulently 
  obtained by Barrick. He threatened to sue and to commence "an all out war" 
  against Barrick if his demands for the payment of U. S. $3 million were not 
  met within ten days. The campaign was to include complaints to various governmental, 
  financial and regulatory authorities about the Company. In a letter dated January 
  11, 2002, he stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Since my time left is short; should we not Agree to Agree in 10 days; my actions 
  will be very swift and unfortunately because of your profile; and Action will 
  result to be extremely serious to the stance and Public Image of Barrick's Gold 
  in Chile. Perhaps even in the world.</p>
<p>
  [11] Barrick investigated the allegations. It then notified Mr. Lopehandia that 
  they were unfounded in its view, and that Barrick would not accede to his demands.</p>
<p>
  [12] True to his word, Mr. Lopehandia embarked upon an Internet campaign by 
  posting a blizzard of messages on "bulletin boards" or "message 
  boards" on various Internet web sites. The web sites in question are dedicated 
  to providing information to those interested in the gold mining industry, including 
  those interested in investing in the stocks of gold or gold-industry companies. 
  Some of the web sites are dedicated to discussions concerning Barrick specifically. 
  The web sites include www.lycos.com (in the financial markets message board 
  sections dedicated to Barrick and another company, Durban Roodeport Deep Limited 
  ("Durban Deep")); www.yahoo.com and www.yahoo.ca (in the financial 
  markets message board section dedicated to Barrick); www.siliconinvestor.com; 
  www.theminingweb.com; and www.miningindia.com.</p>
<p>
  [13] The messages and e-mails complained of filled nine thick volumes of exhibits 
  before the motions judge. They fall into three categories, chronologically, 
  namely: </p>
<p class="indent">
  a) statements published between July 31, 2001 and October 8, 2002 (the date 
  of service of the libel notice) - 7 volumes;</p>
<p class="indent">
  b) statements published after service of the libel notice but before the issuance 
  of the statement of claim on October 30, 2002 - 1 volume; and</p>
<p class="indent">
  c) statements published after service of the statement of claim and before the 
  hearing on February 14, 2003 - 1 volume.</p>
<p>
  [14] Barrick attempted to file an additional volume of messages published after 
  the hearing but before judgment. The motions judge declined to accept this evidence. 
  It is unnecessary to resolve the debate over whether she was correct in doing 
  so, as the additional evidence would simply have confirmed her finding that 
  Mr. Lopehandia will continue to make defamatory statements against Barrick.</p>
<p>
  [15] The motions judge correctly found that the voluminous statements published 
  by Mr. Lopehandia were defamatory of Barrick and, on the deemed facts, published 
  with malice. Indeed, the libel was of a most serious nature. The libellous campaign 
  was conducted over a prolonged period of time and in the face of - and in defiance 
  of - Barrick's protests and attempts to obtain redress. As well as attacking 
  and undermining Barrick's claim to ownership of the Pascua Lama Project - a 
  serious allegation in itself, given the proportionate significance of the Project 
  to the company's overall gold reserves - the many postings accused Barrick of 
  a long list of criminal misconduct. The list is extensive, comprising allegations 
  of fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, manipulation of world gold prices for 
  Barrick's own benefit, misrepresentation to government officials, improperly 
  influencing government officials, obstruction of justice, pursuing organized 
  crime, attempted murder, arson, and genocide and crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>
  [16] It is true, as the motions judge found, that the messages are "emotional, 
  often incoherent, rambling and highly critical of Barrick, its officers, directors 
  and employees". Nevertheless, the postings clearly conveyed the meaning 
  in the allegations listed above. Some examples will suffice: </p>

<p class="indent">Barrick's books are WORSE Than ENRON.</p>
<p class="indent">I can PROVE IT in a Court of LAW.</p>
<p>
  [17] There is evidence that Mr. Lopehandia's numerous postings were read by 
  users of the Internet, including people in Ontario, and that they have prompted 
  enquiries from Barrick's shareholders, from financial analysts, and from regulatory 
  agencies including the Toronto Stock Exchange. These enquiries continue. Moreover, 
  Mr. Lopehandia's messages have elicited their own constituency of support and 
  encouragement, thus amplifying the spread of the defamation throughout the Internet.</p>
<p>
  [18] The motions judge discounted Barrick's evidence about the harm to its reputation 
  as lacking in detail, and in some respects unsupported. She concluded that Mr. 
  Lopehandia's statements "come across as a diatribe or a rant" and 
  were unlikely to be taken seriously by a reasonable reader, "especially 
  those who are said to have read the material, such as stock analysts or individuals 
  working for the TSE." She held that the defamatory words, notwithstanding 
  their repetition, had not caused any serious damage to Barrick's business reputation. 
  At paragraph 44 of her decision, she concluded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Given that the main concern in the litigation was to vindicate the corporation's 
  reputation and the lack of any evidence of adverse economic impact, but recognizing 
  that general damages for libel are at large, and that there have been hundreds 
  of repetitions of the libelous statements, I award general damages of $15,000.00 
  for damage to reputation.</p>
<p>
  [19] The motions judge then went on to consider and reject Barrick's claims 
  for punitive damages and injunctive relief.</p>
<p>
  THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>
<p>
  [20] Appellate courts should not lightly interfere with damage awards, particularly 
  the award of a jury or judge alone in a defamation case where damages are "at 
  large": see Hill v. Church of Scientology, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130 at 1194-1196; 
  Botiuk v. Toronto Free Press Publications Ltd., [1995] 3 S.C.R. 3 at 37-38; 
  and Hodgson v. Canadian Newspapers Co. (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 161 at para. 60. 
  In Botiuk, at 38, Cory J said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Perhaps the cautionary note expressed in Hill bears repeating. Namely, that 
  appellate courts should, for the reasons expressed in Hill, proceed with restraint 
  and caution before making any variation in assessments of damages in libel cases.</p>
<p>
  [21] In Hill, Cory J. relied heavily upon the decision of this court in Walker 
  v. CFTO Ltd. (1987), 59 O.R. (2d) 104 (C.A.). There, Robins J.A. observed (at 
  110): </p>
<p class="indent">
  An appellate court is not entitled to substitute its own judgment on the proper 
  amount of damages for the judgment of the jury. The question is not whether 
  the court would have awarded a smaller sum than was awarded by the jury; nor 
  is the question whether the size of the verdict was merely too great. The question 
  is whether the verdict is so inordinately large as obviously to exceed the maximum 
  limit of a reasonable range within which the jury may properly operate or, put 
  another way, whether the verdict is so exorbitant or so grossly out of proportion 
  to the libel as to shock the court's conscience and sense of justice.</p>
<p> [22] Walker and Hill involved jury awards. There appears to be little jurisprudence 
  in Ontario as to the standard that applies to appellate review of judge-alone 
  damage awards in defamation cases. In my view - even though the bywords remain 
  "caution" and "restraint" - an appellate court has more flexibility in reviewing 
  an award of damages for defamation made by a judge alone than in the case of 
  one made by a jury. When Hill was before this court, the court acknowledged 
  the general rule in England "that an appellate court might more readily overturn 
  an award by a judge sitting alone than an award by a jury: see Blackshaw v. 
  Lord, [1984] Q.B. at p. 27".<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a></p>
<p>
  [23] It makes sense that the standard of review should be somewhat different 
  in such a case. When examining a jury award, in the absence of errors in the 
  charge to the jury, the court is limited to a consideration of the amount in 
  question. No reasons are provided for the damage calculation, and there is a 
  purpose therefore in focusing on whether the award is inordinately high or low. 
  In the case of a judge alone, however, the court has the benefit of the judge's 
  reasons for arriving at the quantum of damages, and, as well as considering 
  quantum, can determine whether there have been any errors in law or in principle, 
  or whether the judge has misapprehended or misapplied the facts. As the British 
  Columbia Court of Appeal noted in Brown v. Cole, [1998] B.C.J. No. 2464 at para. 
  50, "error of law and serious misapprehension of the evidence go, almost 
  without saying, as grounds for interference by a provincial appellate court".</p>
<p>
  [24] Courts in other provinces have considered this question. They have generally 
  concluded that appellate courts should only reluctantly interfere with judge-alone 
  defamation awards but that they may do so where the judge has made an error 
  in law, applied a wrong principle, seriously misapprehended the evidence, or 
  made an award that is inordinately high or low. See Brown v. Cole, supra; Safeway 
  Stores Ltd. v. Harris, [1948] 2 W.W.R. 211 (Man. C.A.); Langille v. McGrath, 
  [2001] N.B.J. No. 414 (N.B.C.A.) at paras. 22-24; and Farrell v. St. John's 
  Publishing Co. Ltd., [1986] N.J. No. 19.</p>
<p>
  [25] I accept the following statement from the decision of the Newfoundland 
  Court of Appeal in Farrell, at 13, as an accurate outline of the law: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In assessing damages in a libel action a judge, sitting without a jury, has 
  a great deal of latitude and the Court of Appeal will not readily interfere 
  with his award unless it is satisfied that he arrived at his figure either by 
  applying a wrong principle of law or through a misapprehension of the facts 
  or that the amount awarded was so extremely high or so low as to make it an 
  entirely erroneous estimate of the damages. (See Flint v. Lovell, [1935] 1 K.B. 
  354 at 360; Associated Newspapers v. Dingle, [1964] A.C. 371 at 393 applying 
  Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd. [1942] A.C. 601 and Nance 
  v. British Electric Railway Co. Ltd., [1951] A.C.601).</p>
<p> [26] This court has effectively applied that standard in the past, even if 
  not acknowledging it specifically. In Royal Bank of Canada (c.o.b. Chargex) 
  v. Battistella [1994] O.J. No. 1717, it increased the plaintiff's award on the 
  basis that the trial judge had erred by assessing general damages based only 
  on the plaintiff's economic loss without incorporating an element for injured 
  feelings. Botiuk, supra, was the reverse (see [1993] O.J. No. 239 (C.A.)). The 
  court interfered with the trial judge's award of general damages not only because 
  it thought the damages inordinately high but also because he had failed to include 
  an element of lost professional business in the damages.<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> 
  Finally, in Hodgson at para. 60 the court relied on the fact "there was no error 
  in principle in taking [the] aggravating factors into account when assessing 
  general damages" in deciding not to interfere with the trial judge's award of 
  general damages.</p>
<p>
  [27] With the foregoing principles in mind, then, I turn to an examination of 
  the damages awarded in this case.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="indent">
  General Considerations Concerning Internet Defamation </p>
<p>
  [28] Is there something about defamation on the Internet - "cyber libel", 
  as it is sometimes called - that distinguishes it, for purposes of damages, 
  from defamation in another medium? My response to that question is "Yes".</p>
<p>
  [29] The standard factors to consider in determining damages for defamation 
  are summarized by Cory J. in Hill at p. 1203. They include the plaintiff's position 
  and standing, the nature and seriousness of the defamatory statements, the mode 
  and extent of publication, the absence or refusal of any retraction or apology, 
  the whole conduct and motive of the defendant from publication through judgment, 
  and any evidence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [30] In the Internet context, these factors must be examined in the light of 
  what one judge has characterized as the "ubiquity, universality and utility" 
  of that medium. In Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc. v. Gutnick [2002] HCA 56 (10 
  December 2002), that same judge - Kirby J., of the High Court of Australia -- 
  portrayed the Internet in these terms, at para. 80: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Internet is essentially a decentralized, self-maintained 
  telecommunications network. It is made up of inter-linking small networks from 
  all parts of the world. It is ubiquitous, borderless, global and ambient in 
  its nature. Hence the term "cyberspace".<a href="#a">[4]</a><a name="4"></a> 
  This is a word that recognizes that the interrelationships created by the Internet 
  exist outside conventional geographic boundaries and comprise a single interconnected 
  body of data, potentially amounting to a single body of knowledge. The Internet 
  is accessible in virtually all places on Earth where access can be obtained 
  either by wire connection or by wireless (including satellite) links. Effectively, 
  the only constraint on access to the Internet is possession of the means of 
  securing connection to a telecommunications system and possession of the basic 
  hardware [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [31] Thus, of the criteria mentioned above, the mode and extent of publication 
  is particularly relevant in the Internet context, and must be considered carefully. 
  Communication via the Internet is instantaneous, seamless, inter-active, blunt, 
  borderless and far-reaching. It is also impersonal, and the anonymous nature 
  of such communications may itself create a greater risk that the defamatory 
  remarks are believed: see Vaquero Energy Ltd. v. Weir, [2004] A.J. No. 84 (Alta. 
  Q.B.) at para. 17.</p>
<p>
  [32] These characteristics create challenges in the libel context. Traditional 
  approaches attuned to "the real world" may not respond adequately 
  to the realities of the Internet world. How does the law protect reputation 
  without unduly overriding such free wheeling public discourse? Lyrissa Barnett 
  Lidsky discusses this conundrum in her article, "Silencing John Doe: Defamation 
  and Discourse in Cyberspace", (2000) 49 Duke L.J. 855 at pp. 862-865: </p>
<p class="indent"> Internet communications lack this formal distance. Because 
  communication can occur almost instantaneously, participants in online discussions 
  place a premium on speed. Indeed, in many fora, speed takes precedence over 
  all other values, including not just accuracy but even grammar, spelling, and 
  punctuation. Hyperbole and exaggeration are common, and "venting" is at least 
  as common as careful and considered argumentation. The fact that many Internet 
  speakers employ online pseudonyms tends to heighten this sense that "anything 
  goes," and some commentators have likened cyberspace to a frontier society free 
  from the conventions and constraints that limit discourse in the real world. 
  While this view is undoubtedly overstated, certainly the immediacy and informality 
  of Internet communications may be central to its widespread appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Internet communications may have the ephemeral qualities 
  of gossip with regard to accuracy, they are communicated through a medium more 
  pervasive than print, and for this reason they have tremendous power to harm 
  reputation. Once a message enters cyberspace, millions of people worldwide can 
  gain access to it. Even if the message is posted in a discussion forum frequented 
  by only a handful of people, any one of them can republish the message by printing 
  it or, as is more likely, by forwarding it instantly to a different discussion 
  forum. And if the message is sufficiently provocative, it may be republished 
  again and again. The extraordinary capacity of the Internet to replicate almost 
  endlessly any defamatory message lends credence to the notion that "the truth 
  rarely catches up with a lie". The problem for libel law, then, is how to protect 
  reputation without squelching the potential of the Internet as a medium of public 
  discourse [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [33] These characteristics differentiate the publication of defamatory material 
  on the Internet from publication in the more traditional forms of media, in 
  my opinion.</p>
<p>
  [34] It is true that in the modern era defamatory material may be communicated 
  broadly and rapidly via other media as well. The international distribution 
  of newspapers, syndicated wire services, facsimile transmissions, radio and 
  satellite television broadcasting are but some examples. Nevertheless, Internet 
  defamation is distinguished from its less pervasive cousins, in terms of its 
  potential to damage the reputation of individuals and corporations, by the features 
  described above, especially its interactive nature, its potential for being 
  taken at face value, and its absolute and immediate worldwide ubiquity and accessibility. 
  The mode and extent of publication is therefore a particularly significant consideration 
  in assessing damages in Internet defamation cases.</p>
<p>
  General or Compensatory Damages</p>
<p>
  [35] In my respectful opinion, the motions judge misapprehended the evidence, 
  and erred in principle, in arriving at her award of $15,000 for general and 
  compensatory damages. She did so in five ways. First, her conclusion that a 
  reasonable reader was unlikely to take what Mr. Lopehandia said seriously was 
  contrary to the evidence. Secondly, that conclusion misjudged the target audience 
  and the nature of the potential impact of the libel in the context of the Internet. 
  Given the centrality of these two aspects of her findings to her reasons, they 
  constitute both palpable and overriding error: see Waxman v. Waxman, [2004] 
  O.J. No. 1765 (C.A.), at paras. 289-307. Thirdly, she erred in treating the 
  defamatory statements made against the directors, officers, and employees of 
  Barrick as irrelevant to the damages to Barrick's reputation. Fourthly, she 
  failed to take into account the refusal of Mr. Lopehandia to retract or to apologize. 
  Finally, she erred in reducing the damages she might otherwise have ordered 
  on the basis that her decision would play a significant role in vindicating 
  Barrick's reputation.</p>
<p>
  [36] These flaws sufficiently undermine the award that it must be set aside 
  and reconsidered, in my view.</p>
<p>
  Not Taking the Libel Seriously</p>
<p>
  [37] The motions judge's conclusion that a reasonable reader was unlikely to 
  take what Mr. Lopehandia said seriously, because of its emotional and intemperate 
  nature and because of his use of capitals and pronunciation, lies at the heart 
  of her finding that the defamatory messages did not cause any serious damage 
  to Barrick's business reputation. In my view it is a finding of fact, or an 
  inference drawn from the facts, that is not supported by the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [38] The notion that Mr. Lopehandia's Internet dialogue style - a style that 
  may not be taken seriously in a traditional medium such as a newspaper - may 
  undermine the credibility of his message has some appeal to those of us who 
  are accustomed to the traditional media. However, as I have noted, the Internet 
  is not a traditional medium of communication. Its nature and manner of presentation 
  are evolving, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that people did 
  not take Mr. Lopehandia's postings seriously. In fact, the uncontradicted evidence 
  is to the contrary.</p>
<p>
  [39] For instance, several individuals took the messages seriously enough to 
  contact Barrick by e-mail themselves. On October 25, 2001, Monique Lafleche 
  of The Mining Association of Canada forwarded a Lopehandia message to alert 
  Barrick to the situation. On February 18, 2002, an individual named Jim Versa 
  referred Barrick to two websites where postings could be found. One of these 
  websites, www.goldhaven.com, contained a defamatory posting by Mr. Lopehandia 
  and a response posting from another individual referring Mr. Lopehandia to a 
  different website where he could "relate his experience with the crooks 
  at Medinah [Minerals]". Barrick received a number of communications from 
  John Hartley, one of its shareholders, stating that as a shareholder he was 
  extremely upset that Barrick had not taken action against Mr. Lopehandia. In 
  an e-mail dated September 5, 2002, Mr. Hartley said: </p>
<p class="indent"> Since I wrote you on Friday August 29th, I have read a lot 
  more of the outrageous slander against BARRICK and its Top Management, written 
  by "Gadfly" Lopehandia on the Message Boards of ABX and MDMN at Finance.lycos.com 
  website.</p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion this is going much too far and must come to an 
  end very soon now, because it is affecting the credibility, the image and the 
  prestige of your Great Mining Company and its Top Management.</p>
<p class="indent">It is really becoming a torture for me and many fellow ABX shareholders, 
  to see that nobody is reacting nor sueing [sic] this chilean-canadian reckless 
  pimp, who dares to challenge an exemplary leading international gold company 
  called BARRICK, to whom we trusted our savings investment.</p>
<p class="indent">We definitely don't like to see BARRICK treated openly as a 
  "COWARD CORPORATION", "CESSPOOL OF CR&Egrave;ME AND THEFT", "MONEY LAUNDERER 
  THEIVES", etc, etc; and to see statements like "BARRICK OWES AN APOLOGY TO MR. 
  GEORGE BUSH SENIOR AND TO HIS SONE, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES", "BARRICK 
  GOLD'S REIGN OF FRAUD MUST STOP NOW", "BARRICK IS THE NEXT ENRON" AND THE LIKE.</p>
<p class="indent">When we read this slander we suffer indignation and our blood 
  starts to boil. Please find a way to stop this crap.</p>
<p class="indent">BARRICK WAS BUILT TO LAST AND IN BARRICK WE TRUSTED OUR SAVINGS.</p>
<p class="indent">[Italics and underlining added; block capitals in original]</p>
<p>
  [40] There is evidence as well that the Toronto Stock Exchange contacted Barrick 
  during 2002 to enquire about Mr. Lopehandia's defamatory statements. An inquiry 
  of that nature from a regulatory agency governing a public company is not to 
  be taken lightly.</p>
<p>
  [41] In addition to the specific communications referred to, the evidence of 
  Mr. Garver, the Executive Vice-President and General Counsel of the appellant, 
  is that "Barrick continues to receive complaints and inquiries from concerned 
  shareholders, analysts and other members of the public as a direct result of 
  the Lopehandia defamatory postings".</p>
<p>
  [42] Finally, the record shows that many users of the message boards and bulletin 
  boards have responded to and replied to Mr. Lopehandia's messages. Some invited 
  and encouraged him to go to other websites with his message, thus expanding 
  the scope of the campaign of libel against Barrick, and wishing him well: "may 
  you find your mark", said one of them.</p>
<p>
  [43] These various communications demonstrate that individuals with a variety 
  of interests in Barrick, and one major regulatory agency, were genuinely concerned 
  about what Mr. Lopehandia had to say. There was no evidence to the contrary. 
  In those circumstances, I find the motions judge's conclusion that people were 
  unlikely to take Mr. Lopehandia's messages seriously, to be contrary to the 
  evidence.</p>
<p>
  The Internet Context</p>
<p>
  [44] Secondly, the motions judge failed to appreciate, and in my opinion misjudged, 
  the true extent of Mr. Lopehandia's target audience and the nature of the potential 
  impact of the libel in the context of the Internet. She was alive to the fact 
  that Mr. Lopehandia "[had] the ability, through the Internet, to spread 
  his message around the world to those who take the time to search out and read 
  what he posts" and indeed that he had "posted messages on many, many 
  occasions". However, her decision not to take the defamation seriously 
  led her to cease her analysis of the Internet factor at that point. She failed 
  to take into account the distinctive capacity of the Internet to cause instantaneous, 
  and irreparable, damage to the business reputation of an individual or corporation 
  by reason of its interactive and globally all-pervasive nature and the characteristics 
  of Internet communications outlined in paragraphs 28-33 above.</p>
<p>
  [45] Had the motions judge taken these characteristics of the Internet more 
  fully into account, she might well have recognized Barrick's exposure to substantial 
  damages to its reputation by reason of the medium through which the Lopehandia 
  message was conveyed.</p>
<p>
  The Defamatory Remarks against Officers, Directors and Employees</p>
<p>
  [46] Thirdly, the motions judge erred in dismissing the defamatory statements 
  against the officers, directors and employees of Barrick as irrelevant to her 
  determination of damages respecting Barrick. At paragraph 32 of her reasons 
  she stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In assessing the plaintiff's damages, I have only considered the damage to the 
  corporation's reputation. While the affidavit of Mr. Garver and the factum speak 
  of the libel to Barrick and its officers, directors and employees, the only 
  party to this action is Barrick. Therefore, any defamatory statements regarding 
  any of the officers, directors or employees which have caused damage to their 
  reputations are irrelevant to the calculation of damages in this case. If their 
  reputations have been damaged, it is for them to pursue their own actions [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [47] However, a significant element in Mr. Lopehandia's defamatory campaign 
  against Barrick consisted of lengthy attacks on the integrity and bona fides 
  of its various officers, directors and employees. A corporation can only act 
  through such individuals. False and defamatory statements concerning the people 
  who are responsible for supervising and conducting the affairs of the corporation 
  - particularly a public corporation such as Barrick - must inevitably affect 
  the business reputation of the corporation, as well as that of the individuals. 
  The authors of P.F. Carter-Ruck and H.N.A. Starte, Carter-Ruck On Libel and 
  Slander, 5th ed. (Butterworths: London, 1997), at 197-198, state: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is probable that a statement which reflects upon the honesty of the directors 
  of a company, which is calculated by the imputations to which it gives rise 
  to lead third parties no longer to deal with the company, would also entitle 
  the company to seek substantial damages.</p>
<p>
  [48] I agree. Here, Mr. Lopehandia's campaign was admittedly designed to embarrass 
  Barrick and to influence people to stop dealing with the company. A substantial 
  part of the campaign consisted of the defamatory comments directed at the officers, 
  directors and employees of Barrick for that purpose. While it is true that these 
  individuals would have had to commence their own actions if they wished to recover 
  damages for injury to their own personal reputations, these statements were 
  relevant to the injury to Barrick's reputation. Had the motions judge thought 
  about them in that context, she might well have been persuaded to award substantially 
  higher general damages.</p>
<p>
  No Retraction or Apology</p>
<p>
  [49] Fourthly, when considering the question of general or compensatory damages, 
  the motions judge did not take into account Mr. Lopehandia's refusal to retract 
  or apologize. She correctly recognized that, while corporations are entitled, 
  without proof of damage, to compensatory damages representing the amount necessary 
  to vindicate the company's business reputation, they cannot receive compensation 
  for injured feelings - and therefore are not entitled to aggravated damages. 
  She also held, properly, that a corporation is entitled to recover more than 
  nominal damages but that compensatory damages may be lower for a corporation 
  than damages received by an individual (who is entitled to receive compensation 
  both for injury to reputation and for injury to feelings): Walker v. CFTO, supra, 
  at 113-114. However, there is a caveat to the latter principle. It is to be 
  found in the following passage from Carter-Ruck on Libel and Slander, supra 
  at p. 197 (quoted with approval from the 3rd ed. by Robins J.A. in Walker, supra 
  at 113-114): </p>
<p class="indent">
  Limited companies, and other corporations, may also be awarded general damages 
  for libel or slander, without adducing evidence of specific loss. However, it 
  is submitted that in practice, in the absence of proof of special damage, or 
  at least of a general loss of business, a limited company is unlikely to be 
  entitled to a really substantial award of damages. As was made clear by Lord 
  Reid in Lewes v. Daily Telegraph Ltd., 'A company cannot be injured in its feelings; 
  it can only be injured in its pocket. Its reputation can be injured by a libel 
  but that injury must sound in money.' . . . . That there is an entitlement to 
  general damages which are more than nominal damages is certain, but the amount 
  likely to be awarded to a corporation may be small in commercial terms, unless 
  the defendant's refusal to retract or apologize makes it possible to argue that 
  the only way in which the reputation of the company can be vindicated in the 
  eyes of the world is by way of a really substantial award of damages [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [50] The motions judge acknowledged the repetition of the defamatory statements 
  by Mr. Lopehandia and that "normally, repetition of the libelous statements 
  would increase the damages". However, she discounted the impact of the 
  repetitious statements on the basis of her conclusion that they were unlikely 
  to be taken seriously. She held that a large award of damages was not necessary 
  to vindicate the plaintiff's reputation.</p>
<p>
  [51] Repetition, however, is only one factor to be considered in determining 
  what award of damages is required to vindicate a plaintiff's reputation. Mr. 
  Lopehandia's clear refusal to retract his statements, or to apologize for them 
  - and, indeed, his dogged pursuit of the libelous campaign even after commencement 
  of the proceedings - is an aggravating factor in this case, and a different 
  factor than the repetition of the libel. The motions judge found that Mr. Lopehandia 
  would likely continue his defamatory statements. Had she considered the lack 
  of retraction and apology, along with repetition, in the context of determining 
  whether "a really substantial award of damages" was required to vindicate 
  Barrick's reputation in the circumstances, she might well have come to a different 
  conclusion than she did.</p>
<p>
  The Judgment as Vindication</p>
<p>
  [52] Finally, the appellant submits the motions judge erred in reducing the 
  damages Barrick would otherwise have been entitled to in the circumstances on 
  the basis that her decision would play a significant role in vindicating Barrick's 
  reputation. To the extent the motions judge may have done so, I agree. While 
  Robins J.A. acknowledged in Walker, at 115, that a "judgment enables the 
  plaintiff publicly to brand the defamatory publication as false or groundless, 
  and, when there is no actual damage, can perform the vindicatory function of 
  this cause of action", he was not directing his mind to a reduction in 
  damages that might otherwise be appropriate, as I read his reasons. It is readily 
  apparent that a successful judgment in a defamation case will be of assistance 
  to the plaintiff in vindicating the plaintiff's reputation. However, there is 
  authority for the proposition that such a consideration should not form the 
  basis for decreasing the amount of damages that are reasonably required to vindicate 
  the reputation of a person or corporation: see Safeway Stores Ltd. v. Harris, 
  [1944] 4 D.L.R. 187 (Man. C.A.) at 202-203; Associated Newspapers Ltd. v. Dingle, 
  [1964] A.C. 371 (H.L.). I have difficulty accepting the concept that an otherwise 
  appropriate damage award should be reduced on the principle that the judgment 
  itself will operate as some form of vindication for the plaintiff. As Lord Morton 
  of Henryton noted in Associated Newspapers, at 404, "a judge cannot tell 
  how widely his judgment will be reported and read, nor can he tell how far the 
  plaintiff's general reputation will be improved by his complimentary remarks." 
  Here, it is impossible to say, for instance, that Barrick's judgment will receive 
  the same degree of publication and diffusion on the Internet as Mr. Lopehandia's 
  postings have received.</p>
<p>
  [53] Respectfully, then, I believe the motions judge's award of general damages 
  in the amount of $15,000 is seriously undermined by errors in law and principle 
  and by a misapprehension of the evidence regarding the impact of the libel and 
  its Internet context. The award should be set aside and the amount reconsidered 
  in light of the foregoing principles. Had the motions judge taken the abovementioned 
  factors into account I am far from satisfied that her award would have been 
  as low as it was.</p>
<p>
  Punitive Damages</p>
<p>
  [54] The motions judge dismissed Barrick's claim for punitive damages on several 
  grounds. Relying on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in McElroy v. 
  Cowper-Smith, [1967] S.C.R. 425, she decided that "the emotional and unreasoned 
  tenor of [Mr. Lopehandia's] messages" was such that "no reasonable 
  business person or investor would take him seriously", thus mitigating 
  the claim for punitive damages. In addition, she held that there was no evidence 
  of real vulnerability on the part of Barrick, which she viewed as "the 
  powerful party here", and that this was not a case of Mr. Lopehandia abusing 
  power. Finally, the motions judge concluded that her compensatory award, including 
  costs, would be a sufficient deterrent to prevent the repetition of his conduct.</p>
<p>
  [55] The key principles regarding punitive damages, of which the motions judge 
  was aware, are outlined below. For the reasons that follow, however, she erred 
  in dismissing the claim, in my view.</p>
<p>
  [56] Appellate courts have greater scope and discretion in reviewing awards 
  for punitive damages than is the case for awards of general or compensatory 
  damages. Appellate review is based upon the court's estimation as to whether 
  the punitive damages serve a rational purpose. See Hill v. Church of Scientology, 
  supra, at 1208-1209; Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co. (2002), 209 D.L.R. (4th) 
  257 (S.C.C.) at 288-289.</p>
<p>
  [57] Cory J. described punitive damages in the following fashion in Hill at 
  1208: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Punitive damages may be awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct 
  is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense 
  of decency. Punitive damages bear no relation to what the plaintiff should receive 
  by way of compensation. Their aim is not to compensate the plaintiff, but rather 
  to punish the defendant. It is the means by which the jury or judge expresses 
  its outrage at the egregious conduct of the defendant. They are in the nature 
  of a fine which is meant to act as a deterrent to the defendant and to others 
  from acting in this manner. It is important to emphasize that punitive damages 
  should only be awarded in those circumstances where the combined award of general 
  and aggravated damages would be insufficient to achieve the goal of punishment 
  and deterrence.</p>
<p>
  [58] In Whiten, at 287-289, Binnie J. reviewed comparative principles regarding 
  punitive damages in various common law jurisdictions, and outlined a number 
  of factors that he found to be "consistent with Canadian practice and precedent". 
  The following observation is particularly apt to the present circumstances: </p>
<p class="indent"> . . . [T]here is a substantial consensus that coincides with 
  Lord Pratt C.J.'s view in 1763 that the general objectives of punitive damages 
  are punishment (in the sense of retribution), deterrence of the wrongdoer and 
  others, and denunciation (or, as Cory J. put it in Hill, supra, at para. 196, 
  they are "the means by which the jury or judge expresses its outrage at the 
  egregious conduct").</p>
<p class="indent">. . . [A]ll jurisdictions seek to promote rationality. In directing 
  itself to the punitive damages, the court should relate the facts of the particular 
  case to the underlying purposes of punitive damages and ask itself how, in particular, 
  an award would further one or other of the objectives of the law, and what is 
  the lowest award that would serve the purpose, i.e., because any higher award 
  would be irrational.</p>
<p class="indent">. . . [T]he governing rule for quantum is proportionality. The 
  overall award, that is to say compensatory damages plus punitive damages plus 
  any other punishment related to the same misconduct, should be rationally related 
  to the objectives for which the punitive damages are awarded (retribution, deterrence 
  and denunciation). Thus, there is broad support for the "if, but only if" test 
  formulated, as mentioned, in Rookes, supra, and affirmed here in Hill, supra 
  [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [59] With these principles in mind, I am satisfied that the motions judge erred 
  in failing make an award of punitive damages for the reasons that follow.</p>
<p>
  [60] First, her reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in McElroy 
  v. Cowper-Smith was misplaced in the circumstances, and was influenced again 
  by her flawed conclusion that the repeated libels of Mr. Lopehandia would not 
  be taken seriously by readers. McElroy involved a single defamatory letter circulated 
  to three clergymen and several religious organizations. The defendant was known 
  to be temporarily unstable and given to making unreasoned and extravagant statements 
  about the plaintiffs (who were a lawyer and an insurance executive). Although 
  the majority of the court recognized the serious damage that can be done to 
  the reputation of a professional person from allegations of misconduct and dishonesty, 
  and that punitive damages may be warranted in some such circumstances, they 
  concluded that reasonable business people - the plaintiffs' clientele - would 
  not likely be affected in their dealings with the plaintiffs "by statements 
  coming from the source which they did in this case". Since the libel had 
  not been published to business people, but only to the clergymen and religious 
  organizations, who were very familiar with both the plaintiffs and defendants, 
  punitive damages were not warranted in the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [61] Such is not the case here. Mr. Lopehandia is not known to the unlimited 
  numbers of persons who may have viewed his avalanche of defamatory postings 
  on the Internet. He holds himself out to be a person of substance, knowledgeable 
  in matters relating to the mining industry in Chile, where Barrick's Pascua 
  Lama Project is located, and a representative of many Chilean mining families 
  and other affected persons worldwide. On the evidence referred to earlier, it 
  is apparent that various individuals and organizations, and at least one regulatory 
  agency, were taking his libelous campaign seriously. In my view, McElroy does 
  not assist on the question of punitive damages in this case.</p>
<p>
  [62] Secondly, while vulnerability is a factor to be considered by the court 
  in assessing punitive damages - see Whiten at pp. 300-301 - the motions judge 
  misread that factor in the context of this case, in my respectful opinion. Barrick 
  is not "the powerful party" in the context of the Internet. The impact 
  of the Internet is to neutralize whatever "power" Barrick may have 
  had, in terms of a communication battle with Mr. Lopehandia. In reality it is 
  Barrick that is vulnerable to publications of this nature, and Mr. Lopehandia 
  who is abusing his power. The Internet is one of the most powerful tools of 
  communications ever invented and, as the Collins text cited at the outset of 
  these reasons indicates, it is "potentially a medium of virtually limitless 
  international defamation".</p>
<p>
  [63] Thirdly, the motions judge's conclusion that her compensatory award would 
  operate as a deterrent to Mr. Lopehandia's repeated publications is inconsistent 
  with her own observation that "he has not done so". She found that, 
  in spite of her judgment, "Mr. Lopehandia will continue to make defamatory 
  statements". With respect, an award of general damages in the amount of 
  $15,000 is insufficient to fulfill the dual role of compensation plus punishment 
  and deterrence in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p>
  [64] Finally, punitive damages are simply required in a case such as this, in 
  my view. Mr. Lopehandia's conduct is malicious and high handed. It is unremitting 
  and tenacious. It involves defamatory publications that are vicious, spiteful, 
  wide-ranging in substance, and world-wide in scope. They involve the very type 
  of misconduct that - in the words of Cory J. in Hill at 1208 - is "so malicious, 
  oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency", 
  calling for an award of punitive damages as a "means by which the jury 
  or judge expresses its outrage at the egregious conduct of the defendant". 
  While it is always important to balance freedom of expression and the interests 
  of individuals and corporations in preserving their reputations, and while it 
  is important not to inhibit the free exchange of information and ideas on the 
  Internet by damage awards that are overly stifling, defendants such as Mr. Lopehandia 
  must know that courts will not countenance the use of the Internet (or any other 
  medium) for purposes of a defamatory campaign of the type engaged in here.</p>
<p>
  [65] I would therefore set aside the decision of the motions judge not to award 
  punitive damages in favour of the appellant.</p>
<p>
  Quantum</p>
<p>
  [66] The appellant does not seek a new trial on damages. Both in its notice 
  of appeal and in its factum, it asks for an order awarding Barrick substantial 
  general and punitive damages. The action was not defended. In the circumstances, 
  therefore, this court can proceed on the basis that there is consent to our 
  determining the appropriate damages to be awarded.</p>
<p>
  [67] Having regard to all of the factors referred to above, and the principles 
  to be assessed in determining damages, as outlined in Hill and set out earlier 
  in these reasons, I would set aside the award of the motions judge and substitute 
  for it the following award: </p>
<p class="indent">
  For general damages: $75,000.00</p>
<p class="indent">
  For punitive damages: $50,000.00</p>
<p class="indent">
  Injunctive Relief</p>
<p>
  [68] The motions judge dismissed Barrick's claim for a permanent injunction 
  restraining Mr. Lopehandia from disseminating, posting on the Internet or publishing 
  further defamatory statements concerning Barrick or its officers, directors 
  or employees. She did so on the basis that the court did not have jurisdiction 
  to make such an order, because in her view, (a) service was not properly made 
  with respect to the claim for injunctive relief pursuant to rule 17.02(i) of 
  the Rules of Civil Procedure, (b) there was no evidence Mr. Lopehandia had any 
  assets or presence in Ontario, and (c) the claim for injunctive relief, being 
  a claim in personam, should have been pursued against Mr. Lopehandia in British 
  Columbia, where the courts have the ability to supervise any injunctive relief 
  given.</p>
<p>
  [69] Rule 17.02 provides that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A party to a proceeding may, without a court order, be served outside Ontario 
  with an originating process or notice of a reference where the proceeding against 
  the party consists of a claim or claims,</p>
<p class="indent">
  (g) in respect of a tort committed in Ontario;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (h) in respect of damage sustained in Ontario arising from a tort, wherever 
  committed; or</p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) for an injunction ordering a party to do, or refrain from doing, anything 
  in Ontario or affecting real or personal property in Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [70] The motions judge accepted jurisdiction over the action for damages for 
  libel based upon the provisions of rule 17.02(g) and (h). However, she concluded 
  that the claim for injunctive relief did not fall within rule 17.02(i) because 
  the injunctive relief was not claimed with respect to acts by a party in Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [71] There are two problems with this approach. First, even if it is unclear 
  on the evidence that Mr. Lopehandia is doing or refraining from doing anything 
  in Ontario, he is, in his campaign of libel, doing something affecting personal 
  property in Ontario. Barrick's goodwill - which includes as an important component 
  what on the record is its unblemished corporate reputation in Ontario - constitutes 
  "personal property". The result of Mr. Lopehandia's conduct is to 
  affect that goodwill or personal property negatively. Barrick's claim therefore 
  falls within the provisions of rule 17.02(i). Secondly, there is evidence that 
  Mr. Lopehandia is doing something in Ontario in connection with the publication 
  of the libel. Although the motions judge concluded there was no evidence he 
  had an Internet service provider in Ontario, at least one of the bulletin boards 
  that he utilizes - the Yahoo site - is located in this Province. The affidavit 
  of Mr. Garver shows that users of the Internet in Ontario and elsewhere can 
  access that message board through seamless connections maintained by Yahoo Canada 
  Inc., the offices of which are located in downtown Toronto.</p>
<p>
  [72] Consequently, I am satisfied that Barrick's claim for injunctive relief 
  does fall within the provisions of rule 17.02(i).</p>
<p>
  [73] The more troubling point respecting the claim for injunctive relief is 
  the in personam nature of the remedy, the marginal presence of the defendant 
  in the jurisdiction, and the concerns about enforceability of such an order. 
  The motions judge was correct to be worried about this. Courts have traditionally 
  been reluctant to grant injunctive relief against defendants who are outside 
  the jurisdiction. The reason for this is explained by Robert J. Sharpe in his 
  text, Injunctions and Specific Performance, Looseleaf Edition (Toronto: Canada 
  Law Book, November 2002), at 1-54 to 1-55: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Claims for injunctions against foreign parties present jurisdictional constraints 
  which are not encountered in the case of claims for money judgments. In the 
  case of a money claim, the courts need not limit assumed jurisdiction to cases 
  where enforceability is ensured. Equity, however, acts in personam and the effectiveness 
  of an equitable decree depends upon the control which may be exercised over 
  the person of the defendant. If the defendant is physically present, it will 
  be possible to require him or her to do, or permit, acts outside the jurisdiction. 
  The courts have, however, conscientiously avoided making orders which cannot 
  be enforced. The result is that the courts are reluctant to grant injunctions 
  against parties not within the jurisdiction and the practical import of rules 
  permitting service ex juris in respect of injunction claims is necessarily limited. 
  Rules of court are typically limited to cases where it is sought to restrain 
  the defendant from doing anything within the jurisdiction. As a practical matter 
  the defendant "who is doing anything within the jurisdiction" will 
  usually be physically present within the jurisdiction to allow ordinary service 
  [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [74] As the motions judge noted, however, courts do in some circumstances permit 
  service of claims outside the jurisdiction seeking to prevent publication in 
  the jurisdiction of libelous material originating outside the jurisdiction: 
  see Sharpe, supra, at 1-55; Tozier and Wife v. Hawkins (1885), 15 Q.B. 680. 
  This is one such case, in my view. Moreover, it is also a case where there is 
  a sufficient connection, actual and potential, between the parties and Ontario 
  to justify the granting of a permanent injunction as sought. Not only is there 
  a real and substantial connection between Barrick and Ontario, but there is 
  a connection between the publication of the libel by Mr. Lopehandia and Ontario 
  as well.</p>
<p> [75] Mr. Lopehandia is ordinarily resident in British Columbia, but there 
  is no way to determine from where his postings originate. They could as easily 
  be initiated in an Internet caf&eacute; in downtown Toronto or anywhere else 
  in the world, as in his offices in Vancouver. Given the manner in which the 
  Internet works, it is not possible to know whether the posting of one of Mr. 
  Lopehandia's messages on one of the bulletin boards in question, or the receipt 
  of that message by someone accessing the bulletin board, traveled by way of 
  a server in Ontario to or from the message board.<a href="#a">[5]</a><a name="5"></a> 
  It may have, however. The highly transmissible nature of the tortious misconduct 
  at issue here is a factor to be addressed in considering whether a permanent 
  injunction should be granted. The courts are faced with a dilemma. On the one 
  hand, they can throw up their collective hands in despair, taking the view that 
  enforcement against such ephemeral transmissions around the world is ineffective, 
  and concluding therefore that only the jurisdiction where the originator of 
  the communication may happen to be found can enjoin the offending conduct. On 
  the other hand, they can at least protect against the impugned conduct re-occurring 
  in their own jurisdiction. In this respect, I agree with the following observation 
  of Kirby J. in Dow Jones, at para. 115: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Any suggestion that there can be no effective remedy for the tort of defamation 
  (or other civil wrongs) committed by the use of the Internet (or that such wrongs 
  must simply be tolerated as the price to be paid for the advantages of the medium) 
  is self-evidently unacceptable.</p>
<p>
  [76] Here, at least one of the bulletin boards utilized by Mr. Lopehandia for 
  the dissemination of his campaign against Barrick is operated by Yahoo Canada 
  Inc. in Toronto. The posting of messages on that board constitutes at least 
  an act done by the defendant that affects Barrick's reputation, goodwill, and 
  personal property in Ontario, and arguably constitutes an act done by him in 
  Ontario. The courts in Ontario must have jurisdiction to restrain such conduct. 
  Even if an injunction may only be enforced in this Province against Mr. Lopehandia 
  if he enters the Province personally, there are two reasons why the injunction 
  may nonetheless be effective. The first is that it will operate to prevent Yahoo 
  from continuing to post the defamatory messages: McMillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Simpson, 
  [1996] 2 S.C.R. 1048; Attorney-General v. Times Newspapers Ltd., [1991] 1 A.C. 
  191 (H.L.). Secondly, it may be enforceable in British Columbia, where Mr. Lopehandia 
  resides: Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077; J.-G. 
  Castel and Janet Walker, Canadian Conflict of Laws, 5th ed. (looseleaf) (Butterworths: 
  Toronto, 2004), at 14-31.</p>
<p>
  [77] Barrick's shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It is an Ontario 
  corporation with its head offices and employees, and a business reputation, 
  here. Indeed, the protection and vindication of that reputation in Ontario is 
  what gives rise to the court's mandate in cases of this nature. These factors 
  point to a real and substantial connection between Barrick and Ontario rather 
  than to a jurisdictional link with the defendant. However, they suggest that 
  if the appellant were to take an injunction granted by this Court to British 
  Columbia - where Mr. Lopehandia does have a physical presence - and seek to 
  enforce it there, in this "post-Morguard era", the order might be 
  enforced against him by the courts of that Province. The argument for enforcement 
  would be based upon the principles of order and fairness and upon what Professor 
  Hogg has referred to as "an implicit full faith and credit rule in the 
  Constitution of Canada" as a result of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision 
  in Morguard: see P.W. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada, looseleaf ed., vol 
  1 (Carswell: Toronto, 1998), s. 13.5 at 13-20 to 13-21; Morguard, supra; Muscutt 
  et al. v. Courcelles et al (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 20 (C.A.); Edward Mazey, The 
  Enforcement of Labour Orders outside the Jurisdiction of Origin (2002), 59 U.T. 
  Fac. L. Rev 25, at 37-38. It is not for this court to usurp the role of the 
  courts in another province, of course. However, the British Columbia Court of 
  Appeal has held in two relatively recent cases that jurisdiction based upon 
  the "real and substantial connection" test may be satisfied where 
  the province asserting jurisdiction has a real and substantial connection with 
  the subject matter of the litigation or the cause of action asserted: Pacific 
  International Securities Inc. v. Drake Capital Securities Inc. (2000), 194 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 716 (B.C.C.A.) at 722; Cook v. Pardcel, Mauro, Hultin &amp; Spaanstra, 
  P.C. (1997), 143 D.L.R. (4th) 213 (B.C.C.A.) at 219; see also Braintech, Inc. 
  v. Kostiuk (1999), 171 D.L.R. (4th) 46 (B.C.C.A.). Such is the case here.</p>
<p>
  [78] I would set aside the decision of the motions judge in this regard and 
  grant a permanent injunction as requested, restraining the defendants from disseminating, 
  posting on the Internet or publishing further defamatory statements concerning 
  Barrick or its officers, directors or employees.</p>
<p>
  Pre-Judgment Interest</p>
<p>
  [79] Finally, the appellant submits the motions judge erred in failing to address 
  Barrick's entitlement to pre-judgment interest pursuant to s. 128 of the Courts 
  of Justice Act, which it seeks to have awarded as of September 1, 2002 (the 
  month after it became aware of the Lopehandia campaign). The judgment provides 
  for post-judgment interest from the date of the judgment, March 12, 2003.</p>
<p>
  [80] The motions judge did not deal with the issue of pre-judgment interest, 
  either in her main reasons for judgment or in the supplementary reasons respecting 
  costs. It cannot be said, therefore, that she exercised her discretion with 
  respect to pre-judgment interest.</p>
<p>
  [81] I would grant the appellant pre-judgment interest at the Courts of Justice 
  Act rate from October 25, 2002, the date upon which the statement of claim was 
  issued. Barrick took all reasonable steps to encourage Mr. Lopehandia to cease 
  his libellous campaign. He not only ignored these demands, he became even more 
  determined in his efforts to continue. In fact he has persisted in the campaign, 
  at ever higher levels of intensity, at least up to the time of trial, and, as 
  noted, the motions judge "[had] no doubt that Mr. Lopehandia will continue 
  to make defamatory statements". In my view it is appropriate that pre-judgment 
  interest should run from the date the action was commenced.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION </p>
<p>
  [82] I would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the motions 
  judge and in its place order: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) that the defendants pay to the plaintiff general damages in the amount of 
  $75,000.00;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (b) that the defendants pay to the plaintiff punitive damages in the amount 
  of $50,000;</p>
<p class="indent">
  (c) that the defendants are permanently restrained from disseminating, posting 
  on the Internet or publishing in any manner whatsoever, either directly or indirectly 
  any defamatory statements concerning Barrick or its officers, directors or employees, 
  all as claimed in paragraph 2 of the notice of motion for judgment before the 
  motions judge.</p>
<p>
  [83] Barrick is entitled to its costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis. 
  Brief written submissions may be made in that regard within thirty days of the 
  release of this decision.</p>
<p>
  "R.A. Blair J.A."<br>
  "I agree J.I. Laskin J.A."</p>

<p>
  DOHERTY J.A. (Dissenting): </p>
<p>
  [84] I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of Blair J.A. I join in those 
  reasons in all respects save one. I do not agree that the trial judge misapprehended 
  the evidence or erred in principle in awarding the appellant $15,000.00 for 
  general and compensatory damages. I would not set aside that part of her judgment.</p>
<p>
  [85] As my colleague observes, the award made by the trial judge is entitled 
  to deference in this court as are the findings of fact upon which it is based. 
  It is also germane to observe that the amount awarded at trial, $15,000.00, 
  is well beyond the range of nominal damages and is within the range established 
  by earlier cases of corporate libel where the libel does not cause actual economic 
  loss to the corporation.</p>
<p>
  [86] In Walker v. CFTO Ltd. (1987), 59 O.R. (2d) 104 at 113, Robins J.A. said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A company whose business character or reputation (as distinct from the character 
  or reputation of the persons who compose it) is injuriously affected by a defamatory 
  publication is entitled, without proof of damage, to a compensatory award representing 
  the sum necessary to publicly vindicate the company's business reputation. &#133;</p>
<p>
  [87] To determine the quantum of the award necessary to publicly vindicate a 
  corporation's business reputation, a trial judge must have regard both to the 
  nature of the statements and their impact on those who have heard or read the 
  statements.</p>
<p>
  [88] In the present case, the trial judge described the statements as diatribes 
  or rants. She concluded at para. 38: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; They [the libellous statements] do not leave a reader with the impression 
  that the writer has a credible case against Barrick. Rather, they leave the 
  impression of someone with a grievance, who is emotional and highly intemperate 
  in expressing his views.</p>
<p>
  [89] After considering the nature of the statements, the trial judge turned 
  to their impact on those who read them. She held at para. 39: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; In my view, a reasonable reader is unlikely to take what is said seriously 
  - especially those who are said to have read the material, such as stock analysts 
  or individuals working for the TSE. In assessing damages, one must consider 
  the impact of the messages on the estimation of the plaintiff among right thinking 
  members of society. While Mr. Lopehandia's words are defamatory, I do not believe 
  that they have caused any serious damage to Barrick's business reputation.</p>
<p>
  [90] The trial judge's finding that a reasonable reader was unlikely to take 
  the statements seriously was a finding of fact. This court cannot interfere 
  with that finding absent clear and palpable error. If the finding stands, I 
  do not think there is any basis upon which to interfere with the quantum awarded. 
  Put bluntly, where the libellous statements are not likely to be taken seriously 
  by any reasonable person, $15,000.00 is ample to vindicate a company's business 
  reputation.</p>
<p>
  [91] My colleague, Blair J.A., finds clear and palpable error both in the trial 
  judge's assessment of the nature of the statements and in her conclusion that 
  they were not likely to be taken seriously. As to the nature of the statements, 
  my colleague notes the stylistic difference between Internet dialogue and statements 
  in more traditional media. I am happy to take his word for this. I cannot, however, 
  assume that the trial judge was unaware of this distinction and failed to consider 
  it in arriving at her conclusion that the manner in which the allegations were 
  made tended to undermine their credibility. I take her conclusion to be arrived 
  at with a full understanding of the nature of the medium in which the statements 
  were made.</p>
<p>
  [92] Blair J.A. also finds that the trial judge's conclusion that the libellous 
  statements were not likely to be taken seriously by reasonable people was contrary 
  to the evidence. My colleague refers to the evidence at paras. 38 to 48 of his 
  reasons. The trial judge was alive to this evidence (paras. 34-35). She drew 
  a much different inference. In her assessment, the evidence offered in support 
  of the damages was neither detailed nor convincing. The trial judge noted that 
  there were only two named individuals identified who had complained about the 
  statements and only one of the thousands of the appellant's shareholders who 
  was identified as registering complaints with the appellant. The trial judge 
  also observed that the appellant had failed to provide any details concerning 
  the nature of the inquiry made by the Toronto Stock Exchange. Based on this 
  record, it could well be that the Toronto Stock Exchange acknowledged the falsity 
  of the allegations in the inquiry it made.</p>
<p>
  [93] The non-specific evidence concerning the impact of the statements combined 
  with the trial judge's finding as to the nature of the statements, led the trial 
  judge to find that the statements were not likely to be taken seriously by any 
  reasonable person. I think the evidence was open to the interpretation given 
  to it by the trial judge. The fact that other interpretations, more favourable 
  to the appellant, were also available on the evidence, does not justify appellate 
  intervention.</p>
<p>
  [94] I am satisfied that the trial judge made no clear and palpable error in 
  coming to the conclusion that reasonable persons were not likely to take the 
  libellous statements seriously. I am further satisfied that considered in the 
  light of that factual finding, it cannot be said that an award of $15,000.00 
  for compensatory damages is inordinately low.</p>
<p>
  [95] I need not address the other specific errors identified by Blair J.A. I 
  will, however, refer briefly to two. In holding that the trial judge erred in 
  coming to the conclusion that reasonable persons would not take the statements 
  seriously, Blair J.A. indicates that the trial judge failed to consider the 
  Internet's capacity to cause "instantaneous irreparable damage to the business 
  reputation of an individual or corporation". I do not agree that the trial 
  judge failed to consider this possibility. The possibility identified by my 
  colleague arises, however, only if the information being disseminated on the 
  Internet is reasonably capable of belief. The trial judge's finding that the 
  statements would not be taken seriously rendered the Internet's capacity to 
  cause harm to a company's business reputation irrelevant.</p>
<p>
  [96] My colleague also concludes that the trial judge erred in holding that 
  the defamatory statements made against officers and officials of the appellant 
  were irrelevant to the calculation of the appellant's damages. I agree with 
  Blair J.A. that the trial judge erred in so holding. However, I do not think 
  that this error warrants any variation in the damage assessment given that I 
  would uphold the trial judge's finding that the statements were not likely to 
  be taken seriously by any reasonable person.</p>
<p>
  [97] I would dispose of the appeal as proposed by Blair J.A. except that I would 
  affirm the trial judge's judgment awarding $15,000.00 for general and compensatory 
  damages.</p>
