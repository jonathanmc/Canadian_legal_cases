<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals his convictions for fraud and theft on the sole ground 
  that the Crown prosecutor, Mr. George Orsini, was in a conflict of interest 
  because he had previously acted for the appellant on an assault charge. This 
  ground is raised for the first time on appeal. The appellant has filed fresh 
  evidence, which includes affidavits of Mr. Barsoum, Mr. Orsini, Mr. Barsoum's 
  trial counsel and that counsel's legal assistant. We have reviewed that fresh 
  evidence and admit it in order to address the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [2] When an allegation of conflict of interest is raised for the first time 
  on appeal the party making the allegation bears a more stringent burden. Because 
  the appellate court has the benefit of the trial record, the party making the 
  allegation, here the appellant, must show an actual conflict of interest that 
  prejudiced him during the trial proceedings. </p>
<p>
  [3] We are not satisfied that the appellant has made out a conflict of interest. 
  The assault charge and the fraud prosecution were entirely independent matters. 
  A lawyer is not precluded from acting against a former client unless during 
  the previous retainer the lawyer obtained confidential information relevant 
  to the subsequent retainer. Having considered the fresh evidence material as 
  a whole we are not persuaded that Mr. Orsini received any relevant confidential 
  information during the time he acted for the appellant on the assault charge, 
  a period of about three weeks. </p>
<p>
  [4] The case against the appellant on the fraud charges was based on a police 
  investigation in which Mr. Orsini played no part. The appellant could not point 
  to any instance during the fraud trial when Mr. Orsini used any information 
  gained during the time he acted on the assault charge. We might have had more 
  concern had the appellant given evidence and been subject to cross?examination 
  by Mr. Orsini, but the appellant chose not to testify. </p>
<p>
  [5] For these brief reasons the conviction appeal is dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant also appeals his sentence. He asks to convert his custodial 
  sentence into a conditional one. We think that the sentence imposed by the trial 
  judge was fit. Although recognizing the mitigating factors in the appellant's 
  favour, we agree with the trial judge that a jail term was warranted. The appellant 
  committed a series of serious frauds on a charitable institution. </p>
<p>
  [7] Accordingly, although leave to appeal sentence is granted the sentence appeal 
  is dismissed. </p>
