<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: June 1, 2004</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant was convicted of numerous offences arising out of his relationship 
  with the complainant. The two crucial convictions, however, were for unlawful 
  confinement and sexual assault (counts 6 &amp; 7). Following these convictions 
  the appellant was found to be a dangerous offender and he received an indeterminate 
  sentence. On the other convictions the appellant received a total sentence of 
  two years and nine months, which he has already served.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant appealed his convictions on counts 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8 and 
  the dangerous offender designation. On his conviction appeal the appellant raised 
  four grounds of appeal. On his sentence appeal he argued only that the trial 
  judge erred in failing to consider the long term offender provisions in the 
  Criminal Code. </p>
<p>
  [3] We called on the Crown only on the first two grounds of appeal against conviction, 
  which in this case are related. These two grounds are:</p>
<p>
  1. The failure of the trial judge to adequately instruct the jury as the possibility 
  of collusion between the complainant and her fifteen year old son; and</p>
<p>
  2. The failure of the trial judge to give the jury a stronger instruction on 
  the inconsistencies between the son's preliminary inquiry evidence and his evidence 
  at trial.</p>
<p>
  [4] We decline to give effect to either submission for three main reasons:</p>
<p>
  1. The trial judge did instruct the jury - adequately in our view - on the importance 
  of taking into account a witness's prior inconsistent statements in assessing 
  that witness's credibility and reliability. As important, the trial judge specifically 
  drew to the jury's attention one of the major inconsistencies between the son's 
  preliminary inquiry evidence and his testimony at trial. Moreover, the trial 
  judge cautioned the jury to take into account the circumstances under which 
  the son made his mid?trial statement and the son's evidence that no one had 
  influenced him to change his position.</p>
<p>
  2. In our view, this was not a case in which the defence demonstrated actual 
  collusion or deliberate tailoring of the evidence or perjury on the son's part. 
  Although, obviously the opportunity for the tailoring of evidence existed, the 
  jury had the son's explanation. In this short trial the jury was undoubtedly 
  alive to the defence's argument and in the best position to assess it.</p>
<p>
  3. Defence counsel at trial (not Mr. Doucette), did not ask for a specific instruction 
  on collusion or a more forceful instruction on the son's previous statements, 
  and he made no objection to the charge on either of the two points now raised 
  on appeal. Although the failure to object is not fatal on appeal, it is a strong 
  indicator of counsel's view of the fairness of the charge.</p>
<p>
  [5] For these reasons the appeal against conviction is dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [6] On the sentence appeal, in the trial judge's thorough and exemplary reasons 
  on the dangerous offender application, he took into account (at p. 10 of his 
  reasons) and rejected the submission that a long term offender designation was 
  appropriate for this appellant. Accordingly, although leave to appeal sentence 
  is granted the sentence appeal is dismissed. </p>
