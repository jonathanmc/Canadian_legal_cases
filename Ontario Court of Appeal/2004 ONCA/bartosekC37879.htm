<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The respondent Kirk Bartosek ("Kirk"), sustained catastrophic 
  injuries when he rode his bicycle down a ramp and into the path of an oncoming 
  vehicle driven by the respondent Anne Busk. The vehicle was owned by Paul Busk. 
  Kirk was 6 years old at the time of the accident. The ramp was part of an apartment 
  building owned by the appellant, Turret Realties Inc. ("Turret"). 
  The trial judge found:</p>
<p class="indent"> 1. liability on the part of Turret as the owner and occupier 
  of the premises for failing to discharge its duty to take reasonable care with 
  respect to the foreseeable risk of harm posed by the design of the ramp and 
  obstructions to the view of oncoming motorists; </p>
<p class="indent"> 2. contributory negligence on the part of Kirk apportioned 
  at 50%;</p>
<p class="indent"> 3. no liability on the part of the defendants Anne Busk and 
  Paul Busk; </p>
<p class="indent"> 4. no liability on the part of Andrew Bartosek, the respondent's 
  father. </p>
<p>
  [2] Turret asks that the judgment be set aside and the claims against it be 
  dismissed with costs, or in the alternative, that a new trial be ordered or, 
  in the further alternative, that the judgment be varied on the following grounds: 
  (a) the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself gave rise to a reasonable apprehension 
  of bias; (b) the trial judge erred in finding negligence on the part of Turret; 
  (c) the trial judge erred in finding no negligence on the part of Busk; (d) 
  the trial judge erred by finding the plaintiff only 50% contributorily negligent; 
  (e) the trial judge erred in awarding a gross up for income tax; (f) the trial 
  judge erred in failing to impose a structured award for future care costs; and 
  (g) the trial judge erred in his assessment of damages pursuant to the Family 
  Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 in favour of Kirk's brother and sister. Kirk cross-appeals, 
  submitting that the judgment be varied on the following grounds: (a) the trial 
  judged erred in finding him contributorily negligent or that his percentage 
  of negligence be reduced; (b) the trial judge erred in refusing to award damages 
  for loss of interdependent relationship; and, (c) the trial judge erred in refusing 
  to award a management fee.</p>
<p>
  [3] We found it necessary to call upon the respondents only with respect to 
  grounds (e), (f) and (g) of the appeal. For the following reasons we dismiss 
  the appeal and allow in part the cross appeal. </p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  (1) Appeal</p>
<p>
  (a) Did the trial judge's refusal to recuse himself give rise to a reasonable 
  apprehension of bias?</p>
<p>
  [4] As a result of a motion to increase the claim from $1 million to $9 million, 
  and the required disclosure of a Mary Carter agreement between the respondents 
  Anne Busk and Paul Busk and the plaintiffs, the trial judge became aware of 
  the following facts: </p>
<p>
  1. The Busks' policy limits were $1 million dollars or less and their liability 
  was capped at an undisclosed amount by virtue of the Mary Carter agreement.</p>
<p>
  2. Turret's policy limits were $5 million dollars.</p>
<p>
  3. Andrew Bartosek, who was acting on his own behalf, was uninsured.</p>
<p>
  [5] The trial judge refused Turret's motion that he recuse himself: "I 
  am not persuaded that that [disclosure of the policy limits and the Mary Carter 
  Agreement] is a consideration that would ever consciously or subconsciously 
  influence me in arriving at an appropriate assessment of damages in this case."</p>
<p>
  [6] At the same time, the trial judge granted Turret's request for an adjournment 
  of the trial. Turret took no steps to appeal the trial judge's refusal of the 
  recusal motion in the ensuing seven months before the trial commenced.</p>
<p>
  [7] We do not accept the submission that the trial judge erred by refusing to 
  recuse himself. The appellant conceded that the Mary Carter agreement had to 
  be disclosed to the trial judge. It would have been obvious that Andrew Bartosek 
  was uninsured as he was acting on his own behalf. It is not uncommon for a trial 
  judge to become aware of the availability of policy limits. The trial judge 
  explained in his ruling: "I am satisfied that on the basis of my own past 
  experience in these matters that I am quite able to ignore and remove from my 
  mind information such as that that Mr. Percival has indicated his client is 
  concerned about." In our view, there was no basis for a reasonable apprehension 
  of bias in these circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [8] In any event, counsel for Turret made a tactical decision not to seek leave 
  to appeal the ruling on the recusal motion because he was concerned that he 
  would lose the motion and still find himself before the same trial judge. This 
  tactical decision provides a further basis for rejecting this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (b) Did the trial judge err in finding negligence on the part of Turret? </p>
<p>
  [9] There was ample evidence to support the trial judge's finding that Turret 
  failed to discharge its duty under the Occupiers' Liability Act, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. O.2 to ensure that persons on its premises were reasonably safe given the 
  existence of a relatively steep ramp immediately adjacent to a concrete wall 
  and shrubbery that prevented oncoming traffic from seeing a cyclist descending 
  the ramp until the cyclist had exited the ramp. Turret knew that children played 
  in the area and failed do anything to alleviate this risk posed by the design 
  of the ramp. We agree with the trial judge that the issue of Turret's liability 
  did not turn on compliance or non-compliance with the applicable building codes. 
  Evidence of previous safe usage of premises is only one factor to be considered 
  when determining whether the duty of care prescribed by the Occupiers' Liability 
  Act has been satisfied. An occupier has a continuing duty to take positive steps 
  to make premises safe and is not absolved of liability because no accident has 
  yet occurred. </p>
<p>
  (c) Did the trial judge err in finding no negligence on the part of Anne Busk?</p>
<p>
  [10] There was evidence to support the trial judge's finding that in the circumstances, 
  Busk had no chance to avoid the accident and there is no basis for us to interfere 
  with that finding. We do not accept the submission that the trial judge failed 
  to apply the reverse onus provision of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. H.8, s. 193. In concluding that Busk was not negligent, the trial judge explicitly 
  stated: "Anne Busk has therefore established that she was not negligent" 
  [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  (d) Did the trial judge err by finding the plaintiff only 50% contributorily 
  negligent?</p>
<p>
  [11] Appellate courts should not interfere with the trial judge's apportionment 
  of liability unless there is demonstrable error in the trial judge's appreciation 
  of the facts or the applicable legal principles. We have not been persuaded 
  of any such error here. The trial judge considered all of the factors he was 
  required to consider and we cannot interfere with his assessment. </p>
<p>
  (e) Did the trial judge err in awarding a gross up for income tax?</p>
<p>
  [12] We do not accept the appellant's submission that the trial judge erred 
  by including a gross up for income tax on the damages for future care costs 
  because that award was reduced by 50% on account of the plaintiff's contributory 
  negligence. The plaintiff will still receive a substantial capital sum and the 
  trial judge was entitled to make the award for gross up on the assumption that 
  the plaintiff would prudently invest that capital sum to ensure a steady stream 
  of income which would attract income tax: see Townsend v. Kroppmanns, 2004 SCC 
  10.</p>
<p>
  (f) Did the trial judge err in failing to impose a structured award?</p>
<p>
  [13] The trial judge did not err by refusing the appellant's request to impose 
  a structured award. The appellant conceded that the cause of action arose prior 
  to the effective date of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, s. 
  116, therefore that section does not apply. There is a long line of authority 
  that, absent legislation or the consent of both parties, the plaintiff cannot 
  be forced to accept periodic payments in lieu of a lump sum award. Accordingly, 
  the trial judge did not err by refusing to make such an order in the exercise 
  of the court's parens patriae jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  (g) Did the trial judge err in his assessment of the Family Law Act damages?</p>
<p>
  There was ample evidence to support the trial judge's finding that the plaintiff's 
  siblings made extraordinary efforts in meeting his special care needs and we 
  see no basis upon which we could interfere with his admittedly substantial award 
  of Family Law Act damages in their favour.</p>
<p>
  Cross-Appeal</p>
<p>
  (a) Did the trial judge err in finding Kirk to be contributorily negligent to 
  the extent of 50%?</p>
<p>
  [14] As we have already stated, the scope of appellate review is narrowly circumscribed 
  in this area. We see no demonstrable error in the trial judge's appreciation 
  of the facts or the applicable legal principles that would justify the intervention 
  of this court. </p>
<p>
  (b) Did the trial judge err in refusing to award for damages for loss of interdependent 
  relationship?</p>
<p>
  [15] The trial judge found that, on the evidence before him, this aspect of 
  the claim had not been made out and that it should be rejected as speculative 
  in nature. We are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in coming to this 
  conclusion, and accordingly, we would not interfere on this ground.</p>
<p>
  (c) Did the trial judge err in refusing to award a management fee?</p>
<p>
  [16] The respondent cross-appeals the trial judge's refusal to award a management 
  fee. The rationale for a management fee where the plaintiff has suffered a debilitating 
  injury as a result of the defendant's tortious conduct is explained in Townsend, 
  supra at paras. 5 and 6: </p>
<p class="indent"> The dollar amount received for future care costs is actually 
  lower than projected costs because it is assumed that the amount paid will be 
  invested and will earn income before being used for future needs&#133;[The award 
  is] discounted to reflect the present value of the expenses incurred or the 
  income earned at a future date, taking inflation adjustments into consideration. 
  The purpose of the discount rate is thus to ensure that victims will be fully 
  compensated but that defendants will not be called on to overpay. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">The same underlying rationale guides the attribution of management 
  fees and tax gross up. The law aims at ensuring that the value of the amounts 
  awarded to victims is maintained over time. In tort law, victims of personal 
  injuries are awarded management fees when their ability to manage the amount 
  they receive is impaired as a result of the tortious conduct. The purpose of 
  this segment of the award is to ensure that amounts related to future needs 
  are not exhausted prematurely due to the inability of the victims to manage 
  their affairs.</p>
<p>
  [17] The trial judge's findings bring the present case within the principle 
  described in Townsend. The trial judge found that in view of the serious impairment 
  the plaintiff suffered as a result of the accident, he is incapable of managing 
  his own finances and that he and his family will require professional assistance 
  in that regard. The trial judge also found that the expert evidence called by 
  the respondent as to the basis for calculating a professional fee for such assistance 
  "was appropriate and consistent with the provisions of Rule 53.09 [establishing 
  the discount rate for future pecuniary damages]."</p>
<p>
  [18] However, the trial judge refused to award a management fee for the following 
  reason: "Surely, a professional manager of funds of that magnitude ought 
  to be able to earn his or her fee without really encroaching on the award and 
  the income earned by it." In our view, this conclusion is speculative in 
  nature and inconsistent with his acceptance of the respondent's expert evidence 
  as to the cost of professional management assistance. If a professional manager 
  is required, it seems inevitable that the cost of a professional manager will 
  be taken from the income earned by the award and that the amount available the 
  meet the respondent's needs will be reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>
  [19] We do not agree with the appellant's submission that the absence of evidence 
  as to specifically how the funds would be actually dealt with after they had 
  been paid into court provided a basis for denying the award of a management 
  fee. As the passage quoted from Townsend indicates, the entire regime of discounted 
  awards assumes that the amount of the award will be invested to earn income. 
  The defendant benefits from the discount to reflect present value. Fairness 
  requires that where, because of the defendant's tort, the plaintiff will incur 
  a cost to achieve the level of assumed income, the defendant should bear that 
  cost.</p>
<p>
  [20] Accordingly, we would allow the cross appeal to the extent of amending 
  the judgment to include an award of $302, 989 for a management fee. We understand 
  from paragraph 3 of the reasons of the trial judge dated 25 February 2002 and 
  the submissions of counsel that a small adjustment to the gross up award is 
  required as a consequence of the award for a management fee. Accordingly, the 
  damages for cost of future care should be amended to include an award of a management 
  fee of $302,989 and the award for gross-up should be adjusted from $610, 800 
  to $604, 399 with appropriate adjustments to these amounts to be made on account 
  of the finding of contributory negligence.</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [21] The appeal is dismissed, and the cross appeal is allowed, but only to the 
  extent outlined in paragraph 20. The respondents are entitled to their costs 
  of the appeal which we fix in the following amounts: $21,000 inclusive of GST 
  and disbursements in favour of the Bartosek respondents and $12,000 inclusive 
  of GST and disbursements in favour of the respondent Busk.</p>
