<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants argue that they were no longer bound by a guarantee in the 
  amount of $150,000 and that the motions judge erred in granting summary judgment 
  for half the amount of the guarantee. In fact, on the evidence, the appellants 
  conceded that they owed $75,000. There is, therefore, no genuine issue for trial 
  in respect of that amount.</p>
<p>[2] The respondent Bank cross-appeals and seeks judgment on the full amount 
  of the guarantee. The appellants each signed a letter from the Bank dated September 
  24, 2002, which deleted the amendment to the loan agreement whereby the guarantee 
  could be reduced to $75,000 if certain conditions were met. Although the motions 
  judge makes reference to this letter in his reasons, he does not consider its 
  effect. In our view, the effect of the letter of September 24, 2002 was to reestablish 
  the full amount of the guarantee at $150,000. There is no evidence in the record 
  to raise whether the appellants should not be bound by their signatures on the 
  letter as a genuine issue for trial.</p>
<p>[3] In the result, the appeal is dismissed, the cross-appeal is allowed, the 
  judgment of the motions judge should be amended to provide that the defendants 
  shall pay the plaintiff $150,000 plus prejudgment interest.</p>
<p>[4] The respondent shall have its costs on a partial indemnity basis fixed 
  at $10,000 for the action and $5,000 for the appeal inclusive of disbursements 
  and Goods and Services Tax.</p>
