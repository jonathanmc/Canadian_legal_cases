<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The litigation between the parties concerns their respective rights under 
  a mortgage granted by the appellant Ndem Belende in favour of the respondents, 
  Allan Greenspoon and Belle Lasman. It is only necessary at this point in time 
  to state some of the relevant facts. </p>
<p>[2] In August 2003, Boyko J. heard a motion brought by Mr. Belende to determine 
  the amount of arrears under the mortgage. By order dated August 29, 2003, the 
  motion judge, amongst other things, set out the amounts that had to be paid 
  to redeem the mortgage. </p>
<p>[3] Mr. Belende took issue with certain of the amounts set out by Boyko J. 
  and sought to appeal her order to the Divisional Court. His appeal was quashed 
  by order of Blair R.S.J., as he then was, on October 31, 2003. Blair R.S.J. 
  quashed the appeal on the basis that Mr. Belende had not obtained leave to appeal 
  from an interlocutory order. Alternatively, if the order was a final one, Mr. 
  Belende&#146;s appeal was in the wrong court. </p>
<p>[4] Mr. Belende now brings a motion before this court for leave to appeal the 
  decision of Blair R.S.J. The respondents take the position that leave should 
  not be granted because there is no reason to doubt the correctness of Blair 
  R.S.J.&#146;s decision to quash the appeal in the Divisional Court. </p>
<p>[5] We agree that the appeal to the Divisional Court was properly quashed because, 
  in our view, Boyko J.&#146;s order was final and no appeal from that order could 
  be brought in that court. The appeal was to this court, as of right. However, 
  it is our view that this should not end the matter. </p>
<p>[6] Mr. Belende represents himself. Although his motion for leave to appeal 
  the order of Blair R.S.J. was misconceived, there is no doubt that Mr. Belende&#146;s 
  intention in bringing this motion was to appeal the substance of Boyko J.&#146;s 
  order. Mr. Belende has maintained his intention to appeal the substance of Boyko 
  J.&#146;s order throughout. Further, his appeal, at least in part, does not 
  appear to be frivolous. </p>
<p>[7] In the circumstances, we are of the view that justice requires that we 
  treat this motion for leave as a motion for an extension of time to appeal Boyko 
  J.&#146;s order and that we grant the extension of time. </p>
<p>[8] Mr. Belende takes issue with Justice Boyko&#146;s stipulation that he should 
  pay not only the outstanding monthly payments that were due, but also monthly 
  interest at the rate of 8% in addition to any other interest owing on the principal. 
  He claims that this, in effect, turned an 8% mortgage into a 16% mortgage. He 
  also disputes the respondents&#146; entitlement to the prepayment fee in the 
  amount of $5,460. </p>
<p>[9] We have already heard Mr. Belende&#146;s submissions on the merits of his 
  appeal on the hearing of the motion. In the interest of bringing some finality 
  to these proceedings, we are prepared to entertain Mr. Belende&#146;s appeal, 
  but only in respect to the prepayment fee. Although counsel for the respondents 
  was asked about the prepayment fee, we did not receive his submissions as, understandably, 
  he was not prepared to argue the matter on the merits at that time. </p>
<p>[10] In order to dispose of this matter, we direct the respondents to serve 
  and file written submissions within 14 days of this order on whether Boyko J. 
  was correct in including the prepayment fee as one of the amounts that had to 
  be paid to redeem the mortgage. Mr. Belende shall have 7 days to reply to those 
  submissions in writing if he so chooses. </p>
<p>[11] Mr. Belende also brought two further motions before this court: a motion 
  to set aside the order of the Registrar dismissing Mr. Belende&#146;s appeal 
  from the order of Marchand J.; and a motion to fix the proper amount required 
  to be paid to redeem the mortgage. The submissions in respect of those two motions 
  have been completed. We will render our decision on all three motions after 
  receiving the written submissions on the first motion. </p>
<p>[12] The parties may also make additional submissions on costs as part of their 
  written submissions if they see fit. </p>
