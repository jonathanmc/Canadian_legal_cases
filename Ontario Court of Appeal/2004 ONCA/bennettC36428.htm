<p>On appeal from conviction by Justice J. Lax of the Superior Court of Justice 
  on April 14, 2000 and from sentence imposed on June 22, 2000.</p>
<p></p>
<p> MOLDAVER J.A.: </p>
<p> [1] The appellant was tried by Lax J. without a jury. He was convicted of 
  a number of prostitution-related offences under s. 212 of the Criminal Code. 
  The offences involved three young female complainants under the age of eighteen 
  - M.J., J.F. and J.E.</p>
<p> [2] In relation to M.J., the appellant was convicted of controlling her movements 
  with a view to aiding or compelling her to engage in prostitution (s. 212(1)(d)) 
  and living on the avails of her prostitution (s. 212(1)(j)). With respect to 
  J.F., the appellant was convicted of attempting to procure her to become a prostitute 
  (s. 212(1)(d)). As for J.E., the appellant was convicted of procuring her to 
  become a prostitute (s. 212(1)(d)); living on the avails of her prostitution 
  in aggravating circumstances (s. 212(2.1)); controlling her movements with a 
  view to aiding or compelling her to engage in prostitution (s. 212(1)(h)); and 
  common assault (s. 265 (1)(a)).<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> </p>
<p> [3] For these crimes, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to a global 
  term of six years in the penitentiary. In arriving at that figure, she was required 
  under s. 212(2.1) (living on the avails of J.E.'s prostitution in aggravating 
  circumstances) to impose a minimum sentence of five years. She also credited 
  the appellant with two years for pre-trial custody calculated on a two for one 
  basis. In sum, it was the trial judge's view that a sentence equivalent to eight 
  years in the penitentiary was fit in the circumstances. </p>
<p> [4] The appellant appeals from both conviction and sentence. Of the various 
  grounds of appeal relating to conviction, some are general in nature; others 
  relate to specific counts. In addition, the appellant seeks to adduce fresh 
  evidence relevant to his conviction appeal.</p>
<p> [5] With respect to sentence, the appellant does not take issue with any of 
  the specific sentences imposed. Rather, he challenges the global sentence and 
  submits that in the circumstances, the equivalent of an eight-year penitentiary 
  term was manifestly excessive.</p>
<p> [6] For reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction. With 
  respect to sentence, having regard to the principle of totality and certain 
  mitigating features for which the appellant did not receive adequate credit, 
  I would allow the appeal and reduce the global sentence from six years to four 
  years and six months. </p>
<p> CONVICTION APPEAL</p>
<p> Overview of facts</p>
<p> [7] The grounds of appeal do not require a detailed review of the facts. A 
  brief overview of the appellant's relationship and dealings with the three complainants 
  will suffice. Additional information will be provided where necessary to flesh 
  out a particular ground of appeal.</p>
<p> M.J.</p>
<p> [8] In 1997, M.J. encountered the appellant at the intersection of Carlton 
  and Sherbourne Streets in downtown Toronto. She was sixteen and he was in his 
  mid-twenties. At age sixteen, M.J. was a prostitute. She had engaged in prostitution 
  since age eleven. </p>
<p> [9] As might be expected, M.J.'s background was troubled. She had a youth 
  court record consisting of offences against the administration of justice. When 
  questioned by the police about her involvement with the appellant, she provided 
  a sworn statement that contained some false information. She also admitted to 
  changing her testimony from the preliminary hearing (where she was trying to 
  help the appellant), to her testimony at trial (where she wanted to "have him 
  put away").</p>
<p> [10] It is undisputed that after their initial meeting, M.J. and the appellant 
  formed a relationship that lasted from mid-1997 to the beginning of February 
  1999, a period of about eighteen months. According to M.J., the relationship 
  was both personal and professional. The appellant doubled as her boyfriend and 
  her pimp. At his instance, she gave him the money she earned from prostitution. 
  In return, he provided her with spending money and protection. The professional 
  relationship ended in February 1999 when M.J. gave birth to a child. M.J. saw 
  the appellant for the last time on April 29, 1999.</p>
<p> [11] The appellant did not deny having a long-term relationship with M.J. 
  He claimed that when they first met, he was not aware that she was a prostitute. 
  Indeed, it was three months into their relationship before he became aware of 
  her occupation. Significantly, he denied acting as her pimp and he denied living 
  off the avails of her prostitution.</p>
<p> J.F.</p>
<p> [12] The appellant's involvement with J.F. was short-lived. He met her and 
  J.E. on the streets of downtown Toronto after J.F. and J.E. had run away from 
  their group home. This was at the end of May 1999, a few months after the appellant 
  had broken off his relationship with M.J. J.F. was then age fifteen, J.E. was 
  twelve. </p>
<p> [13] According to J.F., on the day that she and J.E. met the appellant, they 
  spoke to him on two occasions. J.F. testified that at the first meeting, the 
  appellant asked if she and J.E. had ever "worked". J.F. took this to mean "had 
  they ever worked as prostitutes". According to J.F., both she and J.E. replied 
  "no". Before parting company, she said that she and J.E. asked the appellant 
  for his pager number so that they could talk to him later on about working as 
  prostitutes. The appellant provided his number to J.E. </p>
<p> [14] Later that day, J.F. and J.E. encountered the appellant again. This time, 
  according to J.F., the appellant asked them whether they wanted to work as prostitutes 
  or strippers. J.F. replied, "yes" because she needed money. The appellant then 
  explained what would be required of them as prostitutes. In short, he told the 
  girls that they would have to stand on corners, pick up men, and turn the money 
  they earned over to him.</p>
<p> [15] J.F. stated that at one point, while the appellant and J.E. were talking, 
  she took the opportunity to leave. She was frightened and had changed her mind 
  about wanting to become a prostitute. She telephoned her mother and arranged 
  to be picked up. The next day, she returned to the group home. Several hours 
  later, she provided a video statement to the police outlining her dealings with 
  the appellant. </p>
<p> [16] J.E. largely confirmed J.F.'s testimony. The only difference of any possible 
  consequence involved J.E.'s recollection of J.F.'s response when the appellant 
  asked whether they had ever "worked" before. J.E. remembered saying "no" but 
  she recalled J.F. telling the appellant that she [J.F.] had done it before and 
  might be interested in doing it again. </p>
<p> [17] The appellant acknowledged meeting J.F. and J.E. in downtown Toronto. 
  He agreed that they chatted but he denied discussing the subject of prostitution 
  and he denied attempting to procure J.F. to become a prostitute.</p>
<p> J.E.</p>
<p> [18] J.E. testified about meeting the appellant. Her evidence was similar 
  to J.F.'s evidence. J.E. stated that during their last meeting together as a 
  threesome, she and the appellant left J.F. behind and went for a walk. On the 
  walk, the appellant asked her if she had a boyfriend. She replied "no" and he 
  asked her to be his girl. She agreed. When they returned to where they had left 
  J.F., she was gone. </p>
<p> [19] J.E. testified that she spent the next two weeks with the appellant, 
  living in seedy hotel rooms that he arranged. The appellant spent most of his 
  nights away from the room "doing his own thing". During the day, he would mostly 
  sleep.</p>
<p> [20] After they had been together for a few days, the appellant asked J.E. 
  if she wanted to work. Contrary to her true wishes, she agreed to do so. The 
  appellant then provided her with detailed instructions about how much to charge, 
  what the fee covered, how to recognize a police officer, what to do if she got 
  into trouble and the like. After completing the instructions, the appellant 
  quizzed her for about an hour to make sure that she remembered everything. She 
  further testified that he bought her a new purse (her purse was too big), and 
  he purchased a knife for her. In addition, he provided her with condoms and 
  told her how to use them. That night, he took her by taxi to Jarvis and Wellesley 
  Streets, dropped her off and told her to call him when she had the money.</p>
<p> [21] J.E. managed to obtain her first customer within ten minutes. She spent 
  the next two and a half hours with him and received $400. Later that night, 
  at the hotel room, she gave the appellant $250. Without telling him, she kept 
  the rest for herself. </p>
<p> [22] On the following day, the appellant gave her $200 to purchase clothes 
  for "work". J.E. went shopping but instead of buying "work" clothes, she bought 
  "normal" clothes. As time went on, J.E. testified that the appellant became 
  angry with her. He accused her of not listening to him and of hanging around 
  with the wrong people. She believed that he asked her to "work" for him again 
  but she refused. He then became violent. He struck her on the face, grabbed 
  her and threw her onto the bed. She also claims that he threatened her with 
  a knife and inserted it into her vagina.<a href="#1">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  After the beating, J.E. left the appellant and began to live with someone else. 
</p>
<p> [23] Not unlike M.J., J.E. came from a troubled background. She had a youth 
  court record for assault, mischief and failing to comply, and she had spent 
  a good deal of time in group homes. In speaking to the police about her involvement 
  with the appellant, she provided some false information. In her testimony, she 
  admitted to lying to various people about her age and contradicted herself about 
  how often she worked as a prostitute. In cross-examination, she displayed hostility 
  and aggressiveness towards defence counsel.</p>
<p> [24] The appellant admitted that he and J.E. lived together for a short period 
  of time in hotel rooms. He claimed that he offered assistance to her because 
  he was concerned for her safety. He testified that he spent most nights away 
  from the hotel room because he was bothered by J.E.'s constant efforts to have 
  sex with him. </p>
<p> [25] According to the appellant, at no time did he procure J.E. to become 
  a prostitute; nor did he live on the avails of her prostitution, nor did he 
  assault her. He claimed that when he last encountered J.E., she was trying to 
  avoid the police and he helped her by giving her the cab fare she needed to 
  go to her aunt's house. He testified that when they parted, J.E. had no reason 
  to be annoyed with him.</p>
<p> GROUNDS OF APPEAL OF GENERAL APPLICATION</p>
<p> [26] There are two grounds of appeal that are general in application. They 
  can be disposed of summarily.</p>
<p> Failure to properly assess the evidence of the complainants</p>
<p> [27] The appellant submits that in assessing the evidence of the complainants, 
  the trial judge focused solely on their credibility and failed to consider the 
  reliability of their evidence. I would not give effect to that submission for 
  three reasons. </p>
<p> [28] First, the case was presented and argued on the basis of credibility. 
  In his closing remarks, defence counsel made it perfectly clear that he was 
  challenging the credibility (sincerity) of the complainants. He did not take 
  issue with the reliability (trustworthiness) of their evidence.</p>
<p> [29] Second, the record bears out defence counsel's approach. Reliability 
  was a non-issue. The complainants were challenged on the basis that they were 
  deliberately giving false evidence, not that they were doing their best to tell 
  the truth but simply mistaken. In other words, matters of perception, recollection 
  and communication played no part in the defence strategy. Rather, the defence 
  focused on sincerity indicators such as motivation to lie, disreputable antecedents, 
  prior convictions, prior inconsistent statements, perjury and the like. </p>
<p> [30] Finally, in her reasons for judgment, the trial judge referred to both 
  credibility and reliability. Manifestly, her reasons concentrate on the issue 
  of credibility (sincerity) because that is the way the case was presented and 
  argued. In that regard, she considered all of the frailties in the evidence 
  of the complainants and she gave cogent reasons for minimizing their significance. 
  In the end, she felt that she could safely act on the evidence of the complainants. 
  In doing so, although she did not specifically refer to Vetrovec v. The Queen, 
  [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811, she sought out and located various items of confirmatory 
  evidence, some of which came directly from the appellant. Whether she was required 
  to do so as a matter of law need not be decided. Her reasons show that she proceeded 
  with care before acting on the evidence of the complainants to convict the appellant. 
  The appellant's submission to the contrary (outlined in his factum but not pressed 
  in oral argument) is without foundation.</p>
<p> [31] In sum, I see no basis for questioning the manner in which the trial 
  judge assessed the evidence of the complainants. Accordingly, this ground of 
  appeal fails. </p>
<p> Shifting the burden of proof</p>
<p> [32] Second, the appellant contends that the trial judge shifted the burden 
  of proof. In support of that submission, he points to various places in the 
  reasons where she used expressions such as "the evidence of the appellant [on 
  a particular matter] does not raise a reasonable doubt" or "I believe [the complainants 
  evidence on a particular matter] and there is no credible evidence contradicting 
  it that raises a reasonable doubt". The appellant relies on such comments to 
  show that the trial judge shifted the burden of proof and placed an onus on 
  him to raise a reasonable doubt. </p>
<p> [33] I disagree. At the outset of her reasons, the trial judge instructed 
  herself in accordance with the principles in R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> In this case identity is not in issue on any of the counts. 
  The accused testified and concedes that he was in the company of each of the 
  complainants during the periods and in the place described in the indictment. 
  He denies his involvement in the criminal activities with which he is charged, 
  and has offered explanations for it. The central issue in this case is credibility. 
  The position of the defence is that I should accept the evidence of the accused, 
  or at least have a reasonable doubt. If I believe Mr. B., he must be acquitted 
  of these charges. If I believe the complainants and disbelieve Mr. B. this does 
  not end the matter. The evidence that I accept must exclude all reasonable doubt 
  before there can be a finding of guilt as it is the Crown's burden to prove 
  each of the counts in the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p> [34] Taking that instruction into account and considering the trial judge's 
  reasons as a whole (including her reasons for acquitting the appellant on several 
  charges that are not before us), I am satisfied that she was fully aware that 
  the Crown bore the burden of proof and she did not lose sight of that principle 
  in her analysis.</p>
<p> [35] That said, I would not encourage the language used by the trial judge. 
  The problem is purely semantic. There are many ways in which trial judges can 
  signify their belief that the Crown has met its burden. In doing so, prudence 
  dictates that where possible, it is best to avoid language that could be construed 
  as placing an affirmative duty on an accused to disprove his or her guilt. </p>
<p> SPECIFIC GROUNDS</p>
<p>The s. 212(2.1) offence involving J.E.</p>
<p> [36] The appellant raises two grounds of appeal in relation to his conviction 
  for living on the avails of J.E.'s prostitution in aggravating circumstances. 
  Since one of his arguments raises an issue of statutory interpretation, the 
  relevant portions of s. 212 are reproduced below: </p>
<p class="indent"> 212. (1) Every one who</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(j) lives wholly or in part on the avails of prostitution of 
  another person, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment 
  for a term not exceeding ten years.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(j), every person who lives 
  wholly or in part on the avails of prostitution of another person who is under 
  the age of eighteen years is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment 
  for a term not exceeding fourteen years.</p>
<p class="indent">(2.1) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(j) and subsection (2), every 
  person who lives wholly or in part on the avails of prostitution of another 
  person under the age of eighteen years, and who</p>
<p class="indent">(a) for the purposes of profit, aids, abets, counsels or compels 
  the person under that age to engage in or carry on prostitution with any person 
  or generally, and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) uses, threatens to use or attempts to use violence, intimidation 
  or coercion in relation to the person under that age,</p>
<p class="indent">is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment 
  for a term not exceeding fourteen years but not less than five years. </p>
<p> [37] The first issue raised by the appellant relates to the trial judge's 
  interpretation of s. 212(2.1)(b). At trial, the appellant took the position 
  that in order to be convicted under s. 212(2.1), the Crown bore the onus of 
  proving that the violence referred to in subsection (b) was carried out for 
  the purpose of aiding, abetting, counselling or compelling J.E. to engage in 
  prostitution. </p>
<p> [38] The trial judge disagreed. Her reasons for rejecting the appellant's 
  submission on subsection (b) and for finding him guilty as charged are reproduced 
  below: </p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: The section that we've been discussing in 2.1(b) 
  is connected to Section 2.1(a) in that 2.1(a) ends with the word "and", and 
  then goes on to say in b: "Uses, threatens to use or attempts to use violence, 
  intimidation or coercion in relation to the person under that age." The subsection 
  does not say that the violence is in relation to the person under that age for 
  the purposes of aiding, abetting, counselling or compelling. Rather, as I read 
  the section it is in two parts. And so long as each part of the section is made 
  out on the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt it would apply. Even if I am incorrect 
  in my interpretation of this section on the evidence that I have found, there 
  is a nexus between the conduct of the accused in living on the avails of the 
  prostitution of the complainant who was under 18 years of age, and the use of 
  the violence. There will, therefore, be a finding of guilt on Count 9 [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p> [39] It will be seen from this passage that regardless of her conclusion on 
  the meaning of subsection (b), the trial judge was satisfied that the appellant's 
  violence towards J.E. (found to consist of slapping J.E. in the face and throwing 
  her on the bed) was linked to keeping her engaged in prostitution so that he 
  could live off the avails of her work. In my view, that finding was open to 
  the trial judge. Accordingly, without minimizing the significance of the statutory 
  interpretation issue, I would leave it for another day. </p>
<p> [40] The second issue is not found in the appellant's factum. It stems from 
  a question posed by the court, namely, whether J.E.'s evidence was capable of 
  establishing that the appellant was living on the avails of her prostitution. 
  In that regard, it will be recalled that J.E. testified about only one act of 
  prostitution while she was living with the appellant. According to J.E., whose 
  evidence the trial judge accepted, on the night in question, she gave the appellant 
  $250 of the $400 she earned. Of that, the appellant returned $200 to her to 
  buy "work" clothes. Given that J.E. was sharing a room with the appellant and 
  that she had other living expenses, the question that arises is whether it can 
  be said that the $50 which the appellant kept was not simply a contribution 
  from J.E. for her portion of those expenses. </p>
<p> [41] Standing alone, I am inclined to think that once J.E.'s evidence was 
  accepted, even if the appellant only kept $50 of the monies earned by J.E. from 
  prostitution, that would be enough to sustain a finding against him of living 
  on the avails of her prostitution. However, I need not resolve the matter on 
  that basis. The $50 does not stand alone. According to J.E., the appellant provided 
  her with $200 to buy "work" clothes. The trial judge accepted her evidence on 
  that point. Accordingly, the $200 can properly be characterized as an investment 
  by the appellant in his illicit business activities. It was given to J.E. to 
  enable her to carry out her trade and in turn, hand over her earnings to the 
  appellant. Viewed that way, the trial judge's finding that the appellant was 
  living on the avails of J.E.'s prostitution is unassailable.</p>
<p> [42] Accordingly, the grounds of appeal relating to the charge under s. 212(2.1) 
  of the Code fail.</p>
<p> The offence of attempting to procure J.F. to become a prostitute</p>
<p> [43] The appellant raises two issues with respect to this count. </p>
<p> [44] First, he submits that the trial judge failed to appreciate the significance 
  of the conflict in the evidence between J.F. and J.E. regarding J.F.'s response 
  to the appellant when he asked if they had ever "worked" before. It will be 
  recalled that J.F. testified that she replied "no", whereas J.E. recalled J.F. 
  saying that she had done it before and might be interested in doing it again.</p>
<p> [45] It is clear from the trial judge's reasons that she was alive to this 
  discrepancy. Having identified it, she characterized it as "insignificant". 
  In fairness to the trial judge, it would appear that her use of the word "insignificant" 
  was directed to her overall assessment of the credibility of the complainants 
  and not to any potential impact the discrepancy might have on the Crown's ability 
  to prove the essential elements of the offence. I say that because in the sentence 
  immediately following the "insignificant" finding, the trial judge pointed out 
  that it was to be expected that "details such as these [the precise words spoken] 
  would be forgotten or recounted differently". </p>
<p> [46] For purposes of the argument advanced by the appellant, it is to be noted 
  that on the following page of her reasons, the trial judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> I believe J.F.'s account, and there is no credible evidence 
  contradicting it that raises a reasonable doubt. The combination of active persuasion 
  and intention are both proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p> [47] Against that backdrop, the appellant submits that the trial judge was 
  wrong in characterizing the discrepancy as insignificant. He claims that if 
  the trial judge had accepted J.E.'s version, then he could not be convicted 
  of attempting to procure J.F. to become a prostitute because on her own admission, 
  she had already been a prostitute. He further submits that even if J.F. was 
  not telling the truth about having been a prostitute, he had no way of knowing 
  this. Hence, if he did attempt to encourage her to take up prostitution again, 
  at worst, he did so in the honest but mistaken belief that she was already a 
  prostitute. It followed that he could not be found guilty of attempting to procure 
  her to become that which she already was.</p>
<p> [48] I would not give effect to that argument for several reasons.</p>
<p> [49] First, the trial judge made it clear that she believed J.F. She further 
  stated that there was no credible evidence contradicting J.F.'s evidence that 
  raised a reasonable doubt. Her findings can safely be taken as an indicator 
  that she accepted J.F.'s version of what was said and that she rejected J.E.'s 
  account. Having accepted J.F.'s version of what occurred, the appellant's argument 
  loses its foundation. </p>
<p> [50] Second, I am of the view that the appellant's legal argument is flawed. 
  Specifically, I do not accept that if J.F. engaged in prostitution at some earlier 
  time, this somehow immunized her from being procured at a later time, regardless 
  of what she did in the interim. </p>
<p> [51] My view of the matter does not run afoul of R. v. Cline (1982), 65 C.C.C. 
  (2d) 214 (Alta. C.A.), where the court held that it is not an offence to recruit 
  someone who is already a prostitute and that an accused's belief that a person 
  is a prostitute is a defence to the charge. On this record, accepting J.E.'s 
  version of what J.F. said, J.F.'s comment that she had been a prostitute before 
  and might be interested in doing it again hardly fits within the Cline model. 
  In short, I reject the appellant's "once a prostitute, forever a prostitute" 
  argument. </p>
<p> [52] The appellant's second argument can be disposed of briefly. It hinges 
  on his interpretation of the word "procure". Specifically, he submits that taking 
  J.F.'s evidence at its highest, it does not establish that the appellant, through 
  acts of persistence and persuasion, overcame her resistance by overpowering 
  her will.</p>
<p> [53] The appellant's definition of "procure" may be apt for the defence of 
  entrapment but it does not apply to procuring under s. 212(1)(b) of the Code. 
  Under that provision, an accused need only induce or persuade the target: R. 
  v. Deutsch, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 2. J.F.'s evidence amply establishes that the appellant 
  attempted to do just that.</p>
<p> [54] Accordingly, I see no basis for interfering with the appellant's conviction 
  on the charge involving J.F.</p>
<p> FRESH EVIDENCE</p>
<p> [55] In order to appreciate the fresh evidence and the issues surrounding 
  it, it is necessary to set out additional background facts.</p>
<p> [56] In his evidence, the appellant denied earning a living as a pimp. Instead, 
  he claimed that from 1996, he worked in the core of downtown Toronto as a day 
  labourer. Prior to 1996, it was his evidence that after completing a legal assistant's 
  course at Seneca College, he worked as a salaried employee for a group of lawyers 
  on Berkley Street. For all intents and purposes, that work came to an end in 
  1996 when he was convicted of fraud over $5,000 and sentenced to sixty days 
  imprisonment. According to the appellant, although the lawyers knew of his conviction, 
  they wanted him to return to the law firm. Nonetheless, he refused to do so 
  out of a sense of embarrassment and a concern that if anything went missing, 
  he would be blamed. Hence, in 1996, he turned to day labour jobs to support 
  himself and his family.</p>
<p> [57] The appellant testified that although he had a residence in North York, 
  because his work as a day labourer required him to be in the downtown core early 
  in the morning, it was far more convenient for him to live downtown. Accordingly, 
  he worked out a living arrangement with his friend Delroy Snapes which allowed 
  him to stay at Snapes' residence, located at 383 Sherbourne Street in downtown 
  Toronto. That is how he explained his frequent presence around Snapes' residence 
  located in the area of Toronto frequented by prostitutes. According to M.J., 
  he was regularly at that location and often spent most of the night there.</p>
<p> [58] In support of his position that he was not a pimp, the appellant called 
  Ms. Nadia Campoli as a defence witness. Ms. Campoli and the appellant had been 
  friends since 1996. She testified that the appellant would regularly travel 
  to North York to borrow her car and that she and the appellant often went out 
  for dinner and sometimes slept together. Significantly, based on her dealings 
  with him, she had no knowledge that he was a pimp. By the same token, she had 
  no idea what he did for a living or where he lived. She testified that she had 
  never heard of the appellant's friend Delroy Snapes. </p>
<p> [59] In cross-examination, the Crown challenged the appellant about various 
  matters that would normally be considered uncontentious background information. 
  For example, she challenged the appellant on his story that the lawyers on Berkley 
  Street were willing to have him back as an employee despite his conviction for 
  fraud; she challenged his excuse for not returning to the law firm even though 
  it meant having to do menial day labour jobs; she did not accept that he worked 
  at day labour jobs at all; nor did she accept his explanation for spending so 
  much time near 383 Sherbourne Street. In short, it was her position, placed 
  squarely on the table in cross-examination, that the appellant was a pimp, and 
  that he hung around 383 Sherbourne Street not for the reason that he gave but 
  because he oversaw his illicit business activities from that location. </p>
<p> [60] Despite these challenges, the appellant called no evidence to confirm 
  his testimony about the law firm and their willingness to have him back, his 
  work as a day labourer or his living arrangement with Snapes. </p>
<p> [61] Against that backdrop the trial judge made a number of findings against 
  the appellant. First, she did not accept his evidence about attending Seneca 
  College. Next, she rejected his evidence about working with a group of lawyers. 
  In particular, she noted that if "they were eager to have him return to work 
  for them &#133; surely one of them would have come to court". Finally, she rejected 
  his evidence about living with Snapes. In doing so, she noted that Ms. Campoli 
  had never heard of Snapes and that Snapes had not been called as a witness. 
  In the end, she went so far as to say that she did not believe that Delroy Snapes 
  existed and that the appellant's evidence to the contrary was fabricated.</p>
<p> [62] The trial judge delivered her reasons for judgment on April 14, 2000. 
  The sentence hearing was adjourned until June 22, 2000. Between those two dates, 
  the appellant retained new counsel.</p>
<p> [63] On June 22, new counsel sought an adjournment because she had "come across 
  evidence" that might "be relevant to the main issue in the trial" and she wished 
  "to further look into [it]" because "it touches on the main issue of the trial 
  and an application to reopen may be necessary and appropriate". The trial judge 
  refused an adjournment and the sentence hearing went ahead as scheduled.</p>
<p> [64] Against that backdrop, I turn to the fresh evidence. It takes various 
  forms. </p>
<p> [65] First, there is an affidavit from the appellant's trial counsel explaining 
  why confirmatory evidence relating to the appellant's employment, schooling 
  and residence was not called. In essence, counsel indicates that the failure 
  to call confirmatory evidence was not due to a tactical decision. Rather, it 
  was based on the belief that the evidence in question was background information 
  and the defence had no way of knowing that the trial judge would place such 
  significance on it.</p>
<p> [66] Second, there is an affidavit from a lawyer who worked at 145 Berkley 
  Street from 1990 to 1995 in a space-sharing arrangement with other lawyers. 
  During that time frame, he attests to the fact that the appellant did some work 
  for him on an agency basis as a legal assistant. The affidavit is silent about 
  the willingness of the lawyers to have the appellant return following his conviction 
  for fraud. </p>
<p> [67] Third, the appellant's student record and grades from Seneca College 
  are appended to an affidavit sworn by a lawyer.</p>
<p> [68] Fourth, there is an affidavit from a lawyer who states that he represented 
  a man named Delroy Snapes on certain criminal charges in the fall of 2002. He 
  further states that his efforts to contact Mr. Snapes at the behest of appellant's 
  counsel proved unsuccessful. As of March 20, 2003, he had no knowledge of the 
  whereabouts of Mr. Snapes.</p>
<p> [69] Fifth, there are two informations appended to an affidavit from a lawyer. 
  The informations are sworn in July 2002 and April 2000 respectively. They relate 
  to a person named Delroy Snapes who is charged with several criminal offences 
  and on one information, Mr. Snapes' address is shown as 383 Sherbourne Street, 
  Toronto.</p>
<p> [70] The appellant seeks to have the fresh evidence admitted essentially on 
  the basis that the interests of justice require that it be received. Specifically, 
  he argues that if the fresh evidence had been before the trial judge, she would 
  not have made adverse credibility findings against him on such mundane matters 
  as his work, his schooling and his living arrangements. As it is, she made very 
  dramatic findings against him on those matters, including a finding that his 
  testimony about Delroy Snapes was an outright fabrication. </p>
<p> [71] According to the appellant, although those findings were unwarranted, 
  it can be taken as a given that they improperly influenced the trial judge in 
  her assessment of the remainder of his evidence and in the end, deprived him 
  of his right to a fair trial. For that reason, he submits that the fresh evidence 
  should be received and a new trial ordered.</p>
<p> [72] I do not accept the appellant's argument. Beginning with the impugned 
  findings, there can be no doubt that the trial judge overstated the case in 
  respect of certain of them. For example, it was not necessary for her to find 
  that Delroy Snapes did not exist to reject the appellant's evidence about his 
  living arrangement with Snapes and the reason for it. That said, her assessment 
  of the matter was not unreasonable. Snapes did not testify and the appellant's 
  close friend Ms. Campoli did not know of him, nor did she have any idea where 
  the appellant lived. That observation leads me to the first of several weaknesses 
  in the appellant's argument.</p>
<p> [73] Through his trial lawyer, the appellant submits that he had no way of 
  knowing that the so-called "background" information would feature so significantly 
  in the trial judge's analysis. I have difficulty with that submission. While 
  it may hold true with respect to the appellant's attendance at Seneca College 
  and his working arrangements with the Berkley Street lawyers prior to his conviction 
  for fraud, it does not stand up on matters such as the appellant's reason for 
  having to engage in menial day labour work, his evidence that he engaged in 
  such work at all, his evidence that he lived with Snapes and his reason for 
  doing so. As I have already pointed out, those matters were central to the Crown's 
  case and they were put squarely to the appellant in cross-examination. In my 
  view, his failure to respond to them at trial in a more proactive fashion cannot 
  be put down to - "I was caught off guard". Viewed that way, the appellant's 
  "lack of fairness" and "interests of justice" arguments lose much of their force.</p>
<p> [74] That leads me to the second reason for rejecting the appellant's position. 
  Put simply, the proposed fresh evidence does not fill the critical gaps. Nothing 
  in the fresh evidence shows that the appellant was working as a day labourer; 
  nothing in it shows that he was living with Snapes and if so, whether it was 
  for the reason he gave or for some other reason. Significantly, the appellant 
  has had the better part of four years to find Snapes and tender his evidence. 
  To this day, he has not done so.</p>
<p> [75] Taking that into account and bearing in mind that apart from the disputed 
  findings, the trial judge gave other cogent reasons for rejecting the appellant's 
  evidence, I am not persuaded that the proposed fresh evidence, if believed, 
  when taken with the other evidence at trial, could reasonably be expected to 
  have affected the result. </p>
<p> [76] Accordingly, I would not admit the fresh evidence. It follows that I 
  would dismiss the appellant's appeal from conviction</p>
<p> SENTENCE APPEAL</p>
<p> [77] The appellant's crimes were despicable and he deserved to be severely 
  punished. He engaged in a pattern of pimping and preying on young vulnerable 
  girls for personal financial gain. The trial judge was quite right in concluding 
  that a substantial penitentiary sentence was called for. Indeed, as I have already 
  pointed out, the s. 212(2.1) offence alone required that the appellant be imprisoned 
  for a minimum of five years. Taking that as the most serious crime and deducting 
  two years from it for pre-trial custody, the appellant should have received 
  a three-year sentence for that offence. In so concluding, I note that as despicable 
  as the appellant's conduct towards J.E. was, this was not a case where something 
  more than the five-year minimum was required. The other offences involving J.E. 
  were very much related to the s. 212(2.1) offence. In my view, they too warranted 
  three-year sentences, to be served concurrently with each other and concurrent 
  to the three-year sentence for the s. 212(2.1) offence.</p>
<p> [78] The remaining question is whether the trial judge was justified in imposing 
  an additional three years on the counts involving M.J. and J.F. </p>
<p> [79] Viewed in isolation, three years for those crimes would not have been 
  out of line. In M.J.'s case, given her youthful age and the length of the appellant's 
  predatory conduct (eighteen months), a sentence of two and a half years would 
  certainly have been warranted. As for J.F., a six-month consecutive sentence 
  would likewise have been justified.</p>
<p> [80] The real problem lies in the fact that when those sentences are combined 
  with the sentences imposed in relation to J.E., they result in an equivalent 
  of an eight-year sentence. As indicated, that is the global sentence which the 
  trial judge considered to be fit.</p>
<p> [81] In my respectful opinion, that sentence was too high in the circumstances. 
  It failed to adequately reflect the principle of totality, and it did not give 
  adequate consideration to certain mitigating factors that favoured the appellant.</p>
<p> [82] As I mentioned at the outset, the appellant's crimes were despicable 
  and he deserved a substantial penitentiary sentence. That said, in arriving 
  at a fit global sentence, there are several factors that weigh in his favour 
  for which he was not given adequate or any credit.</p>
<p> [83] First, the appellant's misconduct with J.E. was short-lived and the violence 
  which he used against her, though serious, left her without physical injury.</p>
<p> [84] Second, in relation to M.J., it must be remembered that she was a prostitute 
  before she met the appellant. Furthermore, according to her testimony, he treated 
  her well throughout their relationship. There is no suggestion that he was ever 
  violent towards her. </p>
<p> [85] Third, although the appellant has a criminal record, it is dated and 
  involves unrelated crimes. Significantly, prior to committing the crimes at 
  hand, the only custodial sentence on his record is one of sixty days imprisonment 
  for fraud over $5,000 in 1996. That is the last entry on his record. Although 
  the sixty-day sentence did not attract his attention, the substantial penitentiary 
  sentence that he is now facing hopefully will.</p>
<p> [86] As for the appellant, although he has much to learn, his prospects for 
  rehabilitation are not hopeless. He does have some support in the community, 
  and he is an intelligent man. If he puts his mind to it, he could obtain legitimate 
  employment and become a responsible member of society.</p>
<p> [87] In all of the circumstances, leaving aside for the moment time spent 
  in pre-trial custody, I am of the view that a global sentence of six and a half 
  years, as opposed to eight years, would have been appropriate in this case. 
  Taking into account the time served in pre-trial custody, I would adjust that 
  sentence to one of four and a half years. </p>
<p> [88] In the result, I would grant leave to appeal sentence and would vary 
  the sentences imposed by the trial judge as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) On counts 1 and 3 involving M.J., I would substitute one-year 
  sentences on each to be served concurrently.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) On count 6 involving J.F., I would substitute a sentence 
  of six months to be served consecutively to the sentences imposed on counts 
  1 and 3.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) On counts 7, 9, 10 and 12 involving J.E., I would impose 
  sentences of three years concurrent on each count to be served consecutively 
  to the sentences imposed on counts 1, 3 and 6.</p>
<p> [89] Hence, the total sentence is four and one half years commencing June 
  22, 2000, the date on which the appellant was sentenced by the trial judge.</p>

<p>RELEASED: "MR" MARCH 19, 2004</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> In relation to count 12 involving J.E. 
  (sexual assault with a weapon), the trial judge convicted the appellant of the 
  included offence of assault simpliciter. Her mention of assault causing bodily 
  harm at one point in her reasons for judgment was obviously a slip. Elsewhere 
  in her reasons for judgment, as well as her reasons for sentence, she consistently 
  referred to the crime as &#147;assault&#148;.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="#r2">[2]</a> The trial judge did not accept J.E.&#146;s evidence about 
  the knife but she did find that the other forms of violence occurred. Accordingly, 
  on count 12 of the indictment, she acquitted the appellant of sexual assault 
  with a weapon and convicted him of the included offence of common assault.</p>
