<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was charged with two counts in an indictment as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">1. That he, on or about the 1st day of October 1999 at the City 
  of Oshawa in the Province of Ontario, unlawfully did rob Chuck Buzzell of a 
  sum of money, and did use a firearm in the course of that robbery contrary to 
  the provisions of section 344 of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p class="indent">2. That he, on or about the lst day of October, 1999 at the 
  City of Oshawa in the Province of Ontario, unlawfully did use an imitation firearm 
  while committing the indictable offence of robbery contrary to the provisions 
  of section 85(2)(a) [of the Criminal Code].</p>
<p>[2] The primary issue at trial was whether the appellant had, in fact, robbed 
  Mr. Buzzell as alleged in Count 1. The trial judge gave thorough and, in our 
  view, exemplary reasons for concluding that he had. Nonetheless, at the conclusion 
  of his reasons for judgment, the trial judge acquitted the appellant on Count 
  1 and convicted him on Count 2. </p>
<p>[3] In acquitting the appellant on Count 1, it appears from the trial judge's 
  reasons that he was of the view that absent proof that the firearm being used 
  was an actual firearm as opposed to an imitation firearm, the charge must fail 
  in its entirety. In other words, he considered proof of the use of a firearm 
  to be an essential element of the offence of robbery. </p>
<p>[4] With respect, that was wrong. To the extent that the trial judge was certain 
  that the appellant had committed robbery but uncertain as to whether he was 
  using an actual firearm, he should have convicted the appellant of robbery simpliciter: 
  see R. v. D.(A.), (2003) 173 C.C.C. (3d) 177 at 185 (B.C.C.A.). Manifestly, 
  that was what the trial judge wanted to do. Unfortunately however, he did not 
  do so. When the mistake was brought to his attention at the sentence hearing 
  in relation to Count 2, he changed his verdict to guilty of robbery on Count 
  1. Because he was required to reconsider his verdict, we cannot treat the error 
  as a mere clerical error or accidental slip, nor can it be characterized as 
  an irregularity: see R. v. Burke (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at pp. 406 and 
  407 (S.C.C.). It was clearly an oversight and it could have been corrected without 
  difficulty on a Crown appeal had the trial judge let the verdict of acquittal 
  stand. </p>
<p>[5] That however is not what occurred. At the sentence hearing in relation 
  to Count 2, Crown counsel submitted, and the trial judge agreed, that he was 
  not functus on Count 1, and that he had the authority to reverse the acquittal 
  and substitute a verdict of robbery simpliciter. </p>
<p>[6] With respect, in the circumstances of this case, that approach was incorrect. 
  In our view, having found the appellant not guilty on Count 1 (albeit on account 
  of a mistake in law) the trial judge was functus on that count: see R. v. Lessard 
  (1976) 30 C.C.C. (2d) 70 at pp. 74 and 75 (Ont.C.A.). He was not entitled to 
  revisit it a month later on the sentence hearing relating to Count 2. In other 
  words, the trial judge's jurisdiction on Count 1 was spent and it could not 
  be revived on a sentence proceeding relating to a different offence. </p>
<p>[7] That, in turn, leads to the second error. Having acquitted the appellant 
  on Count 1, the trial judge could not convict him on Count 2 since the conviction 
  on that Count required that the appellant first be convicted of robbery: see 
  R. v. Pringle (1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 455 and 456 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>[8] Accordingly, the appellant's conviction on Count 2 must also be set aside 
  unless, as the Crown submits, we can apply s. 686(1)(b)(iii) or (iv) to save 
  it, as well as the robbery conviction. </p>
<p>[9] Commencing with section 686(1)(b)(iv), in our view, that provision does 
  not apply here. The trial judge had no jurisdiction over Count 1 because he 
  was functus. The loss of jurisdiction for that reason can hardly be described 
  as a loss of jurisdiction stemming from a procedural irregularity. </p>
<p>[10] As for s. 686(1)(b)(iii), we think a miscarriage of justice would be occasioned 
  if we were to close our eyes to the fact that the trial judge, acting without 
  jurisdiction, reconsidered his verdict and substituted a conviction for an acquittal. 
  The fact that the appellant was required to appear in court for sentencing on 
  Count 2, a month after his acquittal on Count 1, is of no assistance to the 
  Crown and it only serves to cloud the issue. If Count 2 had not existed, and 
  the trial judge had simply acquitted the appellant on Count 1 and then a month 
  later, after discovering his error of law, ordered the appellant to reappear 
  so that he could change the verdict from not guilty to guilty of robbery, surely 
  that would amount to a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly s. 686(1)(b)(iii) 
  does not apply.</p>
<p>[11] In the end, we would allow the appeal and enter verdicts of acquittal 
  on both Counts.</p>
