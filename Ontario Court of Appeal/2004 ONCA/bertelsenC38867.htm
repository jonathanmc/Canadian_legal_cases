<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the proposed fresh evidence does not satisfy the Palmer test 
  - it was discoverable and, in any event, would have had no impact on the outcome.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in drawing an inference 
  of consciousness of guilt from the appellant's suicide attempt. It was open 
  to the trial judge to reject the appellant's submission that his attempt was 
  to relieve his family of "stress and embarrassment". We see no basis 
  for disturbing his finding that it was unreasonable for a "perfectly innocent 
  man" to decide "that it would be better to kill himself and leave 
  his family behind than go through the court process to establish his innocence."</p>
<p>
  [3] The second submission from the appellant is that the trial judge erred in 
  the way he assessed the complainant's cross-examination. His reasons reflect 
  no misapprehension of the relevance of the cross-examination. Moreover, he was 
  entitled to conclude both that the effect of the cross-examination was to enhance 
  the complainant's credibility and that the appellant's attempts to show deficiencies 
  in the complainant's memory by cross-examining her on insignificant matters, 
  simply gave the complainant further opportunities to demonstrate her credibility.</p>
<p>
  [4] Finally, we see no error in the trial judge's use of the agreed Statement 
  of Fact, and her previous complaints. Her prior statements were properly admitted 
  as part of the narrative and the trial judge was entitled to refer to these 
  prior consistent statements in general terms. There is no basis for concluding 
  that his reasons disclose any misuse of the evidence of prior complaints.</p>
<p>
  [5] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [6] In our view, however, in imposing sentence the trial judge appeared to focus 
  almost exclusively on the offence itself. That being so, it is our role to determine 
  a fit sentence. In light particularly of the fresh evidence about the appellant's 
  medical condition, in all the circumstances we would vary the sentence to three 
  years. </p>
<p>
  [7] Leave to appeal sentence is granted, the sentence appeal is allowed and 
  the sentence varied accordingly.</p>
