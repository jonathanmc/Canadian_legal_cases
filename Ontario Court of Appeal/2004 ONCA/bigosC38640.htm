<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant originally challenged his conviction for unlawful confinement 
  on two grounds. He abandoned the first ground, namely, that the verdict was 
  unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The second ground relates to 
  the appellant's motion for leave to introduce fresh evidence on appeal. The 
  fresh evidence consists, in part, of a copy of the Petition for Divorce issued 
  between the appellant and the complainant, which contains a claim by the complainant 
  for exclusive possession and for the partition and sale of the matrimonial home. 
</p>
<p>[2] The complainant testified at trial that she did not want the matrimonial 
  home and that if the appellant was released from jail, he could have the house. 
  The appellant asserts that the fresh evidence puts the lie to this aspect of 
  the complainant's trial testimony and, because this was a case in which credibility 
  was of critical importance, in the absence of the fresh evidence a miscarriage 
  of justice may have occurred.</p>
<p>[3] In our view, the proposed fresh evidence does not satisfy the criteria 
  for admissibility set out in R. v. Palmer (1980), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (S.C.C.). 
  Counsel for the appellant properly acknowledges that the fresh evidence may 
  have been known to the appellant prior to trial and that, upon the exercise 
  of due diligence, it may also have been available to the appellant's trial counsel. 
  We agree. Moreover, we are not persuaded that it would have affected the result 
  at trial. </p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, the conviction appeal is dismissed. The appellant has abandoned 
  his appeal against sentence. </p>
