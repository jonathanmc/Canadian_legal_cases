<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice A. Hoy of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated November 14, 2002. </p>
<p>
  CRONK J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] E. Roy Birkett is a shareholder and a former officer and director of Astris 
  Energi Inc. ("AEI"), a public holding company whose shares are traded 
  on the over-the-counter market in the United States and on CDNX in Canada. AEI 
  owns all the issued shares of Astris Inc. ("Astris"), a private company 
  that is engaged in the business of developing hydrogen-based fuel energy sources.</p>
<p>
  [2] In November 1999, Birkett sued AEI for the sum of $315,287, which he asserted 
  was advanced by him for reimbursable expenses incurred on behalf of AEI (the 
  "Cash Advances"). Thereafter, in May 2001, Birkett amended his claim 
  to also seek recovery from AEI of the additional amount of $1,627,301. He alleged 
  that this sum was the value of those of his AEI shares that were used to retain 
  various financial consultants to promote AEI (the "Shares Expenses"). 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] Birkett alleged in his action that the officers and directors of AEI had 
  acknow-ledged that he was to be reimbursed for the Cash Advances and the Shares 
  Expenses, which together totalled $1,942,588. In the alternative, Birkett alleged 
  that AEI had been unjustly enriched at his expense.</p>
<p>
  [4] AEI did not dispute that Birkett made the Cash Advances. However, it resisted 
  reimbursement on the basis that Birkett failed to fulfil certain financing obligations 
  to AEI that were a prerequisite to reimbursement. As well, AEI denied that Birkett 
  transferred any shares to financial consultants on its behalf. In the alternative, 
  it alleged that such share transfers were made without AEI's prior knowledge 
  and authorization and for Birkett's own interests, without benefit to AEI.</p>
<p>
  [5] Birkett's action was tried over five days in October 2002 before Hoy J. 
  of the Superior Court of Justice. Birkett and Jiri Nor, the founder of Astris, 
  were the only witnesses at trial. The trial judge found that there was an agreement 
  between the parties that Birkett was not entitled to reimbursement for the Cash 
  Advances until AEI had raised $10 million (U.S.) in equity financing (the "Equity 
  Financing"). At the time of trial, the Equity Financing had not been raised. 
  She further held that there was no agreement by AEI to compensate Birkett for 
  most of the Shares Expenses and, to the extent that AEI had agreed to replace 
  any of the shares used by Birkett for promotional purposes, the preconditions 
  to the issuance of such replacement shares were unfulfilled. She also rejected 
  Birkett's unjust enrichment claim. Accordingly, the trial judge dismissed Birkett's 
  action, without prejudice to his right to seek recovery of the sum of $315,287 
  from AEI on account of the Cash Advances, once the Equity Financing was in place. 
  </p>
<p>
  [6] Birkett appeals the trial judge's denial of his reimbursement claim concerning 
  the Cash Advances, and her rejection of his unjust enrichment claim regarding 
  that part of the Shares Expenses relating to shares transferred to RMJ &amp; 
  Associates ("RMJ"), one of the consultants retained by Birkett. In 
  support of his appeal, he argues that the trial judge erred: (i) in her interpretation 
  of key documents entered into by the parties; (ii) in deciding the case on the 
  basis of an agreement not pleaded by AEI as part of its defence to the action; 
  and (iii) in concluding that there was a juristic reason for AEI's enrichment 
  and Birkett's deprivation concerning the shares transferred to RMJ.</p>
<p>
  [7] For the reasons that follow, I agree with the trial judge that any entitlement 
  by Birkett to reimbursement from AEI is limited to the amount of the Cash Advances 
  and that, until AEI's Equity Financing is in place, this reimbursement claim 
  is premature. I also agree that Birkett failed to make out an unjust enrichment 
  claim concerning that part of the Shares Expenses relating to RMJ. Accordingly, 
  I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  II. FACTS </p>
<p>
  [8] In order to address the issues raised by Birkett in this proceeding, which 
  concern alleged errors of mixed fact and law and misapprehension of the evidence 
  by the trial judge, it is necessary to review the background facts in some detail.</p>
<p>
  (1) AEI's Acquisition of Astris</p>
<p>
  [9] Nor, a scientist experienced in research and engineering, founded Astris 
  as a private company in 1983. Astris purchased hydrogen fuel cell technology 
  and worked with it to develop and market an economical fuel source. By the early 
  1990s, Astris was interested in obtaining financing from outside investors to 
  support the research and development of this technology.</p>
<p>
  [10] Birkett is a semi-retired businessman experienced in the securities industry. 
  In early 1995, he met one of the principals of Astris, who informed him of the 
  company's financing needs. </p>
<p>
  [11] Birkett was then a shareholder of WLD Inc., an inactive public company 
  with few assets. WLD Inc. was a 'reporting issuer' for the purpose of securities 
  regulation in Alberta and its shares traded in select markets in Canada and 
  the United States. Birkett effectively controlled WLD Inc. through his own shareholdings 
  and those of his family, and by means of 2 million shares in WLD Inc. held by 
  King Cade Trust, an off-shore blind trust of which Birkett was the primary beneficiary 
  (the "Trust"). Hemery Trust and Corporate Services Limited ("Hemery") 
  was the sole trustee of the Trust.</p>
<p>
  [12] Birkett proposed a form of reverse take-over arrangement to Astris' management 
  to facilitate the raising of funds for Astris. Under Birkett's proposal, WLD 
  Inc. would dispose at no cost of its only existing asset and thereafter would 
  acquire the outstanding shares of Astris in exchange for shares of WLD Inc.. 
  The shareholders of Astris would receive WLD Inc. shares and options in WLD 
  Inc. which, when exercised, would provide them with a controlling interest in 
  WLD Inc..</p>
<p>
  [13] Birkett also suggested that, as part of this share exchange transaction, 
  Hemery would sell the Trust's shares in WLD Inc. to investors in the United 
  States through a secondary securities offering. Hemery would then use the sale 
  proceeds to subscribe for $10 million (U.S.) of new treasury-issued common shares 
  in WLD Inc., thus providing WLD Inc. with funds to finance Astris' research 
  and development work.</p>
<p>
  [14] Birkett enlisted Richard Clewes and Tim Peterson (collectively with Birkett, 
  the "WLD Group"), to assist with the acquisition of Astris and the 
  proposed securities offering by Hemery in the United States. Each of Clewes 
  and Peterson was compen-sated for his services by the receipt of some of the 
  WLD Inc. shares held by Birkett, his family members, and the Trust. </p>
<p>
  (2) Letter of Intent</p>
<p>
  [15] On March 30, 1995, Astris entered into a letter of intent with WLD Inc. 
  and the WLD Group (the "LOI"), which described the proposed acquisition 
  of Astris by WLD Inc. and "other related transactions". The LOI provided 
  that, following the acquisition, WLD Inc. would change its name to AEI. In addition, 
  paragraph 4 of the LOI stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Messrs. Birkett, Peterson and Clewes, for and on behalf of AEI, shall arrange 
  for and facilitate the sale by the Hemery Trust (located in Jersey, The Channel 
  Islands) of all of the 2,000,000 common shares of WLD (then called AEI pursuant 
  to paragraph 3 above), currently held by the Trust, through a secondary securities 
  offering carried out principally in the United States, which offering shall 
  raise up to U.S. $10,000,000, but in any event not less than U.S. $5,000,000, 
  from outside investors. Such offering shall be on terms and conditions satisfactory 
  to the Board of Directors of AEI. The Hemery Trust shall invest the proceeds 
  of the said offering in a subscription for and the allotment and issue of an 
  additional 2,000,000 common shares of AEI from treasury through a private placement 
  or other exempt transaction. As a result, the number of issued and outstanding 
  common shares of AEI shall be increased accordingly and the working capital 
  financing funds for AEI's future operations shall have been raised and available 
  for use by AEI [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [16] As well, paragraph 5 of the LOI provided, in part: </p>
<p class="indent">
  WLD, Messrs. Birkett, Peterson and Clewes acknowledge and agree that in order 
  to bring the product development activities and operations of Astris forward 
  in accordance with its business plan until the completion of all the steps described 
  above, Astris has unfunded working capital requirements of at least $120,000 
  Cdn. per month of which $60,000 Cdn. would be provided to Astris on a regular 
  monthly basis on the 25th of each and every month starting May 25, 1995, and 
  the balance on an "as required" basis. They undertake and agree to 
  provide such minimum working capital funding to Astris during the period of 
  180 days following the end of the due diligence period (or as it may be automatically 
  extended). This shall be a binding commitment hereunder and not merely an expression 
  of intent. Failure to provide such interim working capital in any month will 
  terminate this letter of intent. The amounts advanced to Astris as described 
  above shall not be repayable unless and until the securities offering provided 
  in paragraph 4 shall close and the Hemery Trust shall have used the proceeds 
  to subscribe for shares of AEI [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [17] It was also stipulated in paragraph 5 of the LOI that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This letter agreement shall, in principle, constitute a letter of intent only, 
  and shall be subject to the terms and conditions expressed herein and not otherwise 
  binding. The proposed transactions shall only be completed upon the negotiation, 
  finalization and execution of definitive legal documentation satisfactory to 
  the parties and their respective counsel. &#133;</p>
<p>
  [18] The LOI was signed by Birkett, Peterson and Clewes, in their personal capacities, 
  by Birkett on behalf of WLD Inc., and by Nor on behalf of Astris.</p>
<p>
  [19] As contemplated by the LOI, WLD Inc. changed its name to AEI in July 1995. 
  In addition, Peterson was replaced as a member of the WLD Group by Don Blenkarn 
  in November 1995. On the record before this court, it is unclear whether Blenkarn 
  formally agreed to assume Peterson's obligations under the LOI.</p>
<p>
  [20] At trial, Birkett conceded that the LOI established a binding commitment 
  by him and the other members of the WLD Group to provide Astris with interim 
  working capital in the amount of $60,000 per month. He also testified that the 
  Cash Advances were provided by him pursuant to the interim funding obligation 
  in the LOI. </p>
<p>
  [21] Birkett and the other members of the WLD Group did not fully discharge 
  their interim funding obligations under the LOI. Indeed, the trial judge found 
  that they defaulted almost immediately in the performance of these obligations. 
  In addition, the sale by the Trust of its shares in WLD Inc., as contemplated 
  under paragraph 4 of the LOI, never took place. </p>
<p>
  [22] Notwithstanding his admission at trial that the Cash Advances were made 
  pursuant to his funding obligation under the LOI, Birkett claimed at trial and 
  before this court that his funding obligation under the LOI was binding only 
  in respect of Astris, and not with respect to AEI. As the Cash Advances were 
  made by him to AEI, the public company, and not to Astris, the private company 
  that was wholly owned by AEI, Birkett asserted that the repayment condition 
  set out under paragraph 5 of the LOI concerning interim funding advances has 
  no application to the Cash Advances.</p>
<p>
  (3) Post-LOI Documents </p>
<p>
  [23] Following execution of the LOI, the parties and/or WLD Inc. and the Astris 
  shareholders entered into a series of written agreements regarding the transactions 
  contemplated by the LOI. Some of these agreements assumed critical importance 
  at trial.</p>
<p>
  (i) Purchase Agreement </p>
<p>
  [24] The first material post-LOI document was a share exchange agreement entered 
  into by AEI, as purchaser, and the shareholders of Astris, as vendors, on November 
  24, 1995 (the "Purchase Agreement"). It provided that the Astris shareholders 
  were to receive shares and warrants (rather than shares and options) in AEI 
  in exchange for the sale by them of their shares in Astris to AEI. Paragraph 
  6(g) of the Purchase Agreement stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  6. The Vendors [the Astris shareholders] severally covenant and agree with the 
  Purchaser [AEI] that: </p>
<p class="indent"> &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">(g) all advances by the purchaser [AEI] shall be recorded on 
  the books of the Corporation [Astris] as loans repayable upon the receipt by 
  the Corporation [Astris] of additional equity financing of a minimum of Five 
  Million ($5,000,000.00) Dollars (U.S.), or otherwise as set out in the Shareholders 
  Agreement attached hereto as Schedule "R" [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [25] By an amending agreement dated February 23, 1996, signed by AEI and the 
  Astris shareholders, paragraph 6(g) was deleted from the Purchase Agreement 
  and the following paragraph was substituted in its stead: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (g) all advances by the Purchaser [AEI] to the Corporation [Astris] shall be 
  recorded on the books of the Corporation [Astris] as loans repayable upon the 
  receipt by the Corporation [Astris] of additional equity financing of a minimum 
  of Ten Million ($10,000,000) Dollars (U.S.), to be repaid from the proceeds 
  of such financing [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [26] Two important changes were effected by this amendment. First, the minimum 
  Equity Financing contemplated by the parties was increased from $5 million (U.S.) 
  to $10 million (U.S.). Second, as amended, the Purchase Agreement provided that 
  the repayment of advances made by AEI to Astris was to be sourced from the funds 
  raised by the Equity Financing.</p>
<p>
  (ii) Financing Agreement and Birkett's </p>
<p>
  Additional Undertaking </p>
<p>
  [27] The share exchange transaction closed on February 27, 1996, four days after 
  the amendment of the Purchase Agreement. On closing, the members of the WLD 
  Group (including Birkett), the Astris shareholders and AEI entered into a written 
  agreement (the "Financing Agreement"), which provided: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. E. Roy Birkett will personally undertake to have the Hemery 
  Trust, a trust formed under the laws of Jersey, in the Channel Islands (the 
  "Trust") offer 1,500,000 AEI Shares held by it (the "Trust Shares") for sale 
  with the Board of AEI setting the time and therefore the price(s) for these 
  sales, with the net proceeds from the sale of all such Trust Shares to be paid 
  directly to AEI, to be recorded on the books of AEI as contributed surplus. 
  All such Trust Shares must be sold through the market or at the then current 
  market price for such AEI Shares.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Additional financing required by AI and/or AEI shall be obtained 
  from the sale of the Trust Shares as noted above together with additional equity 
  financings to be completed with the approval of AEI's board.</p>
<p class="indent">3. All advances made by the WLD Group to AI and AEI, whether 
  before, on or after the Closing shall be immediately repaid once Ten Million 
  ($10,000,000.00) Dollars (U.S.) in equity financing is raised by AEI, to be 
  repaid from the proceeds of such financings.</p>
<p>
  [28] The Financing Agreement fundamentally changed the 'deal' originally contem-plated 
  by the LOI. Under paragraph 1 of the Financing Agreement, Birkett personally 
  undertook to cause the Trust to sell 1.5 million AEI shares and to provide the 
  proceeds of sale to AEI as "contributed surplus". In contrast to the 
  terms of the LOI, no provision was made under the Financing Agreement for the 
  subscription by the Trust of new replacement shares in AEI in consideration 
  for AEI's receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the Trust's existing AEI 
  shareholdings. In addition, under the Financing Agreement, the Trust's shares 
  were to be sold on the open market or at the then current market price, at a 
  time controlled by AEI, rather than through a secondary securities offering 
  by the Trust to investors. Moreover, the Financing Agreement addressed, for 
  the first time, advances made by individual members of the WLD Group to Astris 
  and AEI, as distinct from advances made to Astris by AEI (as contemplated by 
  the Purchase Agreement) and by members of the WLD Group (as contemplated by 
  the LOI). Under the Financing Agreement, past and future advances "to [Astris] 
  and AEI" were repayable from the proceeds of the Equity Financing, once 
  realized. </p>
<p>
  [29] Clewes and Birkett signed the Financing Agreement, as members of the WLD 
  Group. Birkett also signed the Financing Agreement on behalf of AEI. Blenkarn, 
  however, never signed the document. </p>
<p>
  [30] On closing, Birkett also provided a separate written undertaking in favour 
  of AEI, the Astris shareholders, Clewes and Blenkarn concerning the sale of 
  the Trust's AEI shares and the Trust's contribution of the resulting proceeds 
  to AEI's surplus (the "Additional Undertaking"). Like paragraph 1 
  of the Financing Agreement, the Additional Undertaking confirmed that AEI had 
  a "put" in relation to 1.5 million AEI shares held by the Trust. Under 
  this 'put', AEI could dictate the timing of the Trust's dis-position of AEI 
  shares and, hence, of its contribution of the sale proceeds to AEI's surplus.</p>
<p>
  (4) Shares Expenses: RMJ</p>
<p>
  [31] The trial judge accepted that Birkett made various efforts to promote and 
  develop a market for AEI's stock. For this purpose, Birkett retained several 
  stock promoters to provide various services to AEI. In particular, in July 1996, 
  Birkett retained RMJ to act as an independent management consultant for AEI 
  in exchange for 637,000 AEI shares, which were transferred to RMJ by Birkett 
  from his personal AEI shareholdings. </p>
<p>
  [32] From time to time, Birkett sought assurances from AEI's board of directors 
  that the shares transferred to RMJ would be replaced. The directors initially 
  declined to provide such assurance, claiming that it had not authorized the 
  stock transfer and that Birkett made the transfer for his own account, without 
  AEI's prior knowledge or involvement. Ultimately, at a meeting held on November 
  5, 1996, AEI's directors approved the issuance of AEI shares to Birkett, to 
  replace the shares used by him to pay RMJ. However, this approval was subject 
  to an important condition: the delivery of the replacement shares was "to 
  be held pending delivery of the balance of $990,000 U.S." on completion 
  of a securities financing in the United States. This financing did not proceed.</p>
<p>
  [33] Before this court, Birkett's claim for reimbursement of the Shares Expenses 
  based on unjust enrichment concerns only the value of the shares transferred 
  by him to RMJ, allegedly for the benefit of AEI.</p>
<p>
  (5) Exercise by AEI of its 'Put'</p>
<p>
  [34] In mid-March 1996, AEI's board of directors instructed Birkett to sell 
  some of the Trust's shares in AEI. Birkett testified at trial that he never 
  received this sale instruction. Subsequently, however, at a meeting of AEI's 
  board of directors held on June 24, 1997, the directors called for the sale 
  by the Trust of the entire 1.5 million share block and for the proceeds of sale 
  to be applied to AEI's contributed surplus account, as provided for under the 
  Financing Agreement and Birkett's Additional Undertaking. AEI thereby exercised 
  its 'put' on the Trust's AEI shares.</p>
<p>
  [35] In response, Birkett claimed that in the absence of a secondary securities 
  offering by the Trust, as contemplated under the LOI, AEI was not entitled to 
  invoke Birkett's obligations under paragraph 1 of the Financing Agreement or 
  under his Additional Undertaking. At trial, Birkett maintained that it had always 
  been contemplated by the parties that Hemery would sell the Trust's AEI shares 
  as part of a secondary securities offering and that he had no obligation to 
  effect the sale of the Trust's shares except in the context of such an offering.</p>
<p>
  (6) Other Events</p>
<p>
  [36] Birkett became the treasurer and chief financial officer of AEI on September 
  4, 1996. The following year, in September 1997, Nor instructed Blenkarn and 
  Clewes to investigate suspected irregularities in Birkett's dealings with AEI's 
  funds. As a result of this investigation, AEI's board of directors removed Birkett 
  as an officer of AEI at a board meeting held on October 14, 1997. Birkett did 
  not attend this meeting.</p>
<p>
  [37] At the same meeting, the directors of AEI acknowledged that the company 
  was indebted to Birkett for $315,287 on account of the Cash Advances. Financial 
  documents prepared for AEI by its auditors in October 1997 and AEI's 1995 financial 
  statements record that this debt was repayable once the Equity Financing was 
  raised. However, the notes to AEI's financial statements for the years 1996 
  to 1998 fail to record that the $315,287 debt was subject to any specific terms 
  of repayment. At trial, Nor testified that this omission was inadvertent.</p>
<p>
  [38] The minutes of the October 14, 1997 meeting of AEI's board of directors 
  record two other significant matters. First, they indicate that an extensive 
  discussion took place at the meeting regarding Birkett's Shares Expenses claim, 
  including with respect to the shares transferred by him to RMJ. The minutes 
  contain the following entry: "It is clear that if shares were given for 
  promotion, that the shares given did nothing for the financial status of the 
  company and therefore, the gifts whether given or not were of no value to the 
  Company."</p>
<p>
  [39] Second, the minutes record that Blenkarn was instructed to offer Birkett 
  shares in AEI "at 50 cents" in satisfaction of the Cash Advances, 
  that is, 630,574 shares. Blenkarn was also instructed to make a similar offer 
  to other AEI creditors, including Clewes and Nor. Birkett did not accept this 
  offer.</p>
<p>
  [40] Finally, on January 20, 1998 Birkett was replaced as a director of AEI. 
  This litigation was commenced approximately 2 years later.</p>
<p>
  III. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [41] Birkett argues that the trial judge erred in the following ways in dismissing 
  his action against AEI: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) in her interpretation of the LOI, by misconstruing the 
  import of paragraph 5 of the LOI and by allegedly relying on parol evidence 
  as an aid to determining the meaning of the LOI;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) in basing her decision on matters not pleaded by AEI in 
  its defence to the action;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) in her interpretation of the Financing Agreement and in 
  concluding that the Financing Agreement was bind-ing on and enforceable against 
  Birkett; and </p>
<p class="indent">(iv) in rejecting Birkett's unjust enrichment claim in relation 
  to the RMJ Shares Expenses. </p>
<p>
  IV. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) Trial Judge's Interpretation of the LOI</p>
<p>
  [42] Birkett's claim for reimbursement of the Cash Advances does not derive 
  from any of the documents entered into by the parties. Rather, it is based on 
  an alleged unqualified acknowledgement of indebtedness by the directors of AEI. 
  Accordingly, Birkett asserts that the LOI only became relevant at trial because 
  it was relied on and pleaded by AEI in its defence to the action.</p>
<p>
  [43] Birkett argues that the trial judge's decision to reject his claim for 
  reimbursement of the Cash Advances was grounded in the LOI. He then submits 
  that the trial judge mis-interpreted the LOI: (i) by viewing the restriction 
  on the repayment of interim advances to Astris contained in paragraph 5 of the 
  LOI as applicable to the Cash Advances; (ii) by using parol evidence, that is, 
  the Financing Agreement and other post-LOI documents, to interpret the LOI; 
  and (iii) by misconstruing the import of some of the post-LOI documents. </p>
<p>
  [44] I do not agree that the trial judge's decision to deny the Cash Advances 
  claim turned on the LOI; nor am I persuaded that the trial judge erred in her 
  approach to the interpretation of the LOI or in her construction of it.</p>
<p>
  [45] The trial judge stated concerning the Cash Advances claim (at para. 46): </p>
<p class="indent"> The Letter of Intent, the&#133;Purchase Agreement, the amendment 
  to the&#133;Purchase Agreement, the Financing Agreement, Mr. Birkett's May 10, 
  1996 memo to E &amp; Y, the audit confirmation letter dated February 13, 1996 
  and signed by Mr. Birkett on May 15, 1996, and the audited financial statements 
  for the year ended December 31, 1995 subsequently issued all support the finding 
  of an agreement that Mr. Birkett is not be entitled [sic] to be repaid cash 
  advances made by him until AEI raises the designated amount of equity financing, 
  initially US $5 million and then US $10 million [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="indent">This passage clearly indicates that the trial judge regarded 
  the LOI as only one of several underpinnings for her conclusion that Birkett's 
  entitlement to reimbursement of the Cash Advances is subject to the prior receipt 
  of the Equity Financing.</p>
<p>
  [46] The trial judge recognized that the LOI imposed two obligations on Birkett: 
  (i) it obliged him to secure the Equity Financing by arranging for and facilitating 
  the sale by the Trust of 2 million common shares of WLD Inc. (later AEI) through 
  a secondary securities offering and, thereafter, to cause the Trust to subscribe 
  for a like number of treasury-issued common shares in AEI (paragraph 4 of the 
  LOI); and (ii) it required Birkett, together with the other members of the WLD 
  Group and WLD Inc., to furnish interim working capital to AEI on a monthly basis 
  (paragraph 5 of the LOI). The trial judge properly identified these obligations 
  and held that each of them was breached: the securities offering was never undertaken 
  and many of the working capital payments were never made. </p>
<p>
  [47] The trial judge's reasons also reflect an appreciation of Birkett's position 
  concerning paragraph 5 of the LOI, namely, that it did not operate to prevent 
  his reimbursement claim concerning the Cash Advances because they were made 
  to AEI, rather than to Astris. She stated his position succinctly at paragraph 
  47 of her reasons when she observed: "[Birkett] argues that all of his 
  advances were made to AEI and not Astris and that only the Financing Agreement, 
  which he is not bound by because Mr. Blenkarn failed to sign it, restricts his 
  right to repayment from AEI."</p>
<p>
  [48] Significantly, as acknowledged by Birkett in his written argument before 
  this court, nowhere in her reasons does the trial judge suggest that paragraph 
  5 of the LOI operated as a bar to Birkett's claim for reimbursement of the Cash 
  Advances made to AEI, or that it established an agreement by him that he was 
  not entitled to repayment of the Cash Advances. </p>
<p>
  [49] The trial judge's reference to the LOI in paragraph 46 of her reasons, 
  quoted above, must be understood in context. By this reference to the LOI, in 
  my view, the trial judge was simply suggesting that the restriction on the repayment 
  of interim funding advances established under paragraph 5 of the LOI was consistent 
  with the proposition that the overall dealings between the parties resulted 
  in an agreement that Birkett was not entitled to the repayment of monies advanced 
  by him until the Equity Financing was raised. I agree. </p>
<p>
  [50] It is important to recall that Birkett made two crucial concessions during 
  his testimony at trial. First, he acknowledged that the LOI imposed binding 
  obligations on him at the time that he signed it. Indeed, the binding nature 
  of the interim funding obligation set out in paragraph 5 of the LOI is confirmed 
  by the express language of that paragraph. This concession by Birkett is directly 
  contrary to his pleaded position in the action. In his reply pleading, he stated: 
  "Contrary to the allegations in the Statement of Defence, the Letter of 
  Intent was never binding, was replaced by the Share Purchase Agreement, and 
  contains no obligations as alleged in the Statement of Defence." As well, 
  this pleaded position is inconsistent with Birkett's asserted position on this 
  appeal: before this court, Birkett claims that the LOI is the only relevant 
  and controlling document applicable to his claims against AEI.</p>
<p>
  [51] Second, Birkett testified at trial that the Cash Advances were designed 
  to fulfil his interim funding obligation under the LOI. Birkett's only interim 
  funding obligation was created by paragraph 5 of the LOI, which obliged him 
  to fund Astris, not AEI. Thus, Birkett sought at trial to shelter the Cash Advances 
  under the LOI to suggest that he was fulfilling his funding obligation to Astris 
  under that agreement, but denied the relevance of the same agreement when its 
  application would operate to his detriment by restricting his entitlement to 
  repayment.</p>
<p>
  [52] Birkett admitted, however, that he knew that the funds provided by him 
  to AEI were flowing through AEI directly to Astris. This admission was tantamount 
  to a concession by Birkett that he used AEI, a company that he controlled at 
  the time that the Cash Advances were made, as a 'mailbox' or conduit for the 
  delivery of the Cash Advances to Astris.</p>
<p>
  [53] In these circumstances, although the LOI did not address advances made 
  to AEI rather than to Astris, I am of the view that it was open to the trial 
  judge to regard the LOI as one indicator of the intention of the parties concerning 
  the repayment of interim advances made to or for the benefit of Astris. </p>
<p>
  [54] Moreover, the trial judge's conclusion that Birkett is not entitled to 
  repayment of the Cash Advances until AEI raises the contemplated Equity Financing 
  is over-whelmingly supported by the post-LOI documents introduced at trial. 
  This evidence included: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) a memo dated May 10, 1996 to Ernst &amp; Young, AEI's auditors, 
  in which Birkett indicated that advances "from the parent to private company" 
  were identified as "demand loans". In the same memo, Birkett stated: "Repayment 
  is dependent upon the funding of the company and this was and is acceptable 
  to the Directors/Shareholders who lent the funds [emphasis added]."</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) a letter dated February 13, 1996 and signed by Birkett 
  on May 15, 1996 on behalf of WLD Inc., requested by Astris for its auditors, 
  in which Birkett's express confirmation was sought that no fees were repayable 
  to WLD Inc. (subsequently AEI), "unless the securities offering in paragraph 
  4 in the [LOI] closes and unless US $10 million is raised. At that point the 
  amount is repayable in full, from monies raised through the issue of new shares";</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the Purchase Agreement, entered into by AEI in November 
  1995 and amended in February 1996, which provided that all advances by AEI to 
  Astris were only repayable upon Astris' receipt of the Equity Financing. In 
  Birkett's reply pleading, he asserted that the Purchase Agreement, "governed 
  the relationship between the parties and contains all of the obligations of 
  Birkett with respect to the sale of the shares of Astris to AEI"; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) finally, and importantly, the Financing Agreement that 
  was entered into by Birkett as well as AEI, which expressly stated that all 
  advances made "by the WLD Group to [Astris] and AEI, whether before, on or after 
  the Closing" were to be repaid once the Equity Financing was raised by AEI, 
  "from the proceeds of such financings".</p>
<p>
  These documents make it abundantly clear that the parties envisaged that cash 
  advances are not to be repaid until AEI's Equity Financing is in place. </p>
<p>
  [55] Although it is true that some of the post LOI-documents pertain to advances 
  made by WLD Inc. or AEI to Astris - in contrast to advances made by members 
  of the WLD Group to AEI - two of the documents specifically concern advances 
  made by members of the WLD Group to AEI, namely the May 10, 1996 memo to Ernst 
  &amp; Young and the Financing Agreement. This is contrary to Birkett's assertion 
  on this appeal that there is no condition precedent to repayment of the Cash 
  Advances since: "There is no separate agreement regarding advances made 
  by Birkett to AEI. &#133;" This claim assumes that the Financing Agreement 
  is unenforceable.</p>
<p>
  [56] Birkett also submits that the trial judge misconstrued the May 10, 1996 
  memo to Ernst &amp; Young as referring to advances made to AEI when, in fact, 
  it referred to advances from AEI to Astris. I disagree. Although the May 10, 
  1996 memo referred to cheques from the parent company (AEI) to the private company 
  (Astris), the next entry in the memo referenced funds lent by the "Directors/Shareholders". 
  In combination, therefore, these passages can only refer to funds lent to AEI, 
  the parent company, which in turn were transmitted to Astris, the private company, 
  by AEI. The memo clearly states that repayment "is dependent upon the funding 
  of the company". Again, it is important to underscore that Birkett acknowledged 
  at trial that the Cash Advances, although paid to AEI, were retransmitted to 
  Astris. </p>
<p>
  [57] It is also noteworthy that in a memo written by Birkett to the directors 
  of AEI on May 16, 1996, six days after his memo to Ernst &amp; Young, Birkett 
  expressed concern that the members of the WLD Group could "end up with 
  no or very few shares in a financed ASTRIS". He went on to say, "Their 
  (WLD Group) only bonus is the repayment of their loans&#133;when ASTS [sic] 
  is financed&#133;[emphasis added]." This memo, therefore, also indicated 
  that advances of funds made by WLD Group members would only be repaid once the 
  financing funds needed by Astris were in place, regardless of the entity to 
  which the advances were made. </p>
<p>
  [58] Finally, I do not accept Birkett's submission that the trial judge improperly 
  relied on parol evidence to interpret the LOI. I say this for two reasons.</p>
<p>
  [59] First, although Birkett attacks the propriety of the trial judge's consideration 
  of post-LOI documents in determining his Cash Advances claim, Birkett himself 
  invited such consideration and engaged the relevance of at least one post-LOI 
  document in his reply pleading, in which he asserted that the Purchase Agreement 
  "governed the relationship between the parties". </p>
<p>
  [60] Second, the trial judge concluded that the Financing Agreement is a complete 
  answer to Birkett's reimbursement claim concerning the Cash Advances. The trial 
  judge reasoned (at para. 53): </p>
<p class="indent">
  [O]n the assumption that the Financing Agreement was not binding on him, [Birkett] 
  argued that I could not consider extrinsic parol evidence to interpret the [LOI] 
  as covering the terms of repayment of advances made by Mr. Birkett to AEI. I 
  concluded that the Financing Agreement is binding on Mr. Birkett and it clearly 
  and unambiguously sets out the terms of repayment of advances made by him to 
  AEI. Parol evidence was ultimately not an issue [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [61] Accordingly, the trial judge made no error in her perception and application 
  of the evidence. In the end, her decision concerning reimbursement of the Cash 
  Advances was grounded in the terms of the Financing Agreement, rather than in 
  the terms of the LOI. In my view, she did not use the Financing Agreement or 
  other post-LOI documents to interpret the LOI. Instead, she concluded that Birkett's 
  reimbursement claim was answered by the Financing Agreement. I turn next, therefore, 
  to Birkett's challenge of the trial judge's findings concerning the Financing 
  Agreement.</p>
<p>
  (2) Financing Agreement</p>
<p>
  [62] The positions of the parties regarding the relevance and the significance 
  of the Financing Agreement are sharply divided. Birkett argues that since AEI 
  failed to plead it, the Financing Agreement was irrelevant at trial, and is 
  irrelevant on this appeal. He also submits before this court, as he argued at 
  trial, that the Financing Agreement is not binding on or enforceable against 
  him because it was not signed by Blenkarn. Birkett asserts that he would not 
  have signed the Financing Agreement, or provided his Additional Undertaking, 
  if he had known that Blenkarn was not going to sign the Financing Agreement. 
  Finally, Birkett maintains that, contrary to the trial judge's interpretation, 
  paragraph 3 of the Financing Agreement does not preclude his entitlement to 
  be repaid the Cash Advances prior to the obtaining by AEI of the Equity Financing.</p>
<p>
  [63] In contrast, AEI asserts that, as the trial developed and as Birkett's 
  theory of his case evolved, the Financing Agreement became the key document 
  at trial, controlling the outcome of Birkett's claim for reimbursement of the 
  Cash Advances. AEI also raises various arguments in response to Birkett's assertion 
  that it was not open to the trial judge to rely on the Financing Agreement due 
  to AEI's failure to plead it. It contends that the Financing Agreement is enforceable 
  against Birkett and that the trial judge did not misinterpret its essential 
  terms. </p>
<p>
  (i) Pleadings Argument</p>
<p>
  [64] Birkett pleaded in paragraph 7 of his original statement of claim that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  At all times, Birkett incurred these expenses [the Cash Advances] on behalf 
  of AEI with the consent and knowledge of the other directors and officers of 
  AEI, and with the acknowledgement by the other officers and directors of AEI 
  that such expenses were to be reimbursed to Birkett by AEI.</p>
<p>
  [65] AEI responded to this allegation in its statement of defence and counter-claim 
  by: (i) generally traversing the substantive allegations contained in Birkett's 
  pleading (paragraph 2); (ii) pleading the material terms of the LOI, including 
  paragraph 5 thereof (paragraphs 6 to 8); (iii) acknowledging that Birkett contributed 
  $315,287 "to Astris" (paragraph 9); and (iv) alleging that Birkett 
  failed to fulfil his express obligations under the LOI and, thus, was not entitled 
  to any repayment of this sum (paragraph 9). </p>
<p>
  [66] AEI concedes that it did not specifically plead the February 1996 Financing 
  Agreement, or various other post-LOI documents. Although its pleading contains 
  several references to a 'financing agreement', as defined in AEI's pleading 
  these references pertain to the LOI. </p>
<p>
  [67] The parties proceeded to discoveries on these pleadings, prior to any amendment 
  by Birkett of his statement of claim. Nor was discovered on behalf of AEI. He 
  was questioned concerning the Financing Agreement and stated that it was binding 
  on the parties. Birkett asserted on discovery that his entitlement to reimbursement 
  of the Cash Advances arose in October 1997 when he was removed as an officer 
  of AEI. Thus, Birkett effectively conceded that he had no entitlement to such 
  reimbursement prior to October 1997, unless the Equity Financing was in place. 
  When questioned as to the basis for his claim that a reimbursement entitlement 
  arose when he was removed as an officer of AEI, Birkett said: "Because 
  I was kicked off the board as officer, and I'm not party to what is going on, 
  and I contribute, and, therefore, they had changed the terms unilaterally and 
  I want my money." Birkett did not allege that AEI agreed to reimburse him 
  for the Cash Advances upon his removal as an officer of the company. Rather, 
  Birkett simply believed that he was entitled to reimbursement because he had 
  been removed as an officer of the company.</p>
<p>
  [68] Following discoveries, Birkett amended his pleading to include the Shares 
  Expenses claim. He did not amend paragraph 7 of his pleading to conform with 
  his discovery evidence concerning his entitlement to reimbursement of the Cash 
  Advances, or to plead that the LOI did not apply because the Cash Advances were 
  made to AEI, rather than to Astris.</p>
<p>
  [69] At trial, Birkett appeared to advance a different reimbursement theory. 
  His trial testimony on this issue was confusing and often contradictory. At 
  various times, Birkett maintained that AEI, as the public company that received 
  the Cash Advances, was obliged to repay them. At other times, he testified that 
  Astris, as "the private company where the technology was" bore the 
  repayment obligation. Birkett also repeated his assertion, made on discovery, 
  that he became entitled to reimbursement of the Cash Advances when his position 
  as an officer of AEI was terminated. Ultimately, however, Birkett asserted that 
  AEI, as the recipient of the Cash Advances, was subject to a repayment obligation 
  from the time that the Cash Advances were made; that the repayment condition 
  imposed by paragraph 5 of the LOI applied to Astris only; and that AEI was responsible 
  for repaying the Cash Advances even though, from the outset, it lacked the assets 
  to do so.</p>
<p>
  [70] Birkett's position at trial made the Financing Agreement highly relevant. 
  Indeed, by the end of Birkett's cross-examination at trial, it was clear that 
  AEI was responding to Birkett's revised theory of his reimbursement case on 
  the basis of the enforceability and the content of the Financing Agreement. 
  </p>
<p>
  [71] In my view, notwithstanding Birkett's submission to the contrary, it cannot 
  be said that Birkett was prejudiced by this turn of events. After the discovery 
  process, Birkett was aware of AEI's position that the Financing Agreement was 
  binding on him. Birkett did not object at trial to the admission of the Financing 
  Agreement; nor did he seek an adjournment of the trial to prepare different 
  or additional evidence to respond to AEI's reliance on that agreement. Instead, 
  notwithstanding that he was cross-examined on the Financing Agreement, Birkett 
  closed his case after his own testimony, without seeking to call any other witnesses. 
  Moreover, although Nor gave evidence concerning the Financing Agreement, Birkett 
  elected not to call any reply evidence. As well, although Birkett complains 
  on this appeal that Blenkarn was not called as a witness at trial to explain 
  why he did not sign the Financing Agreement, Birkett offers no explanation for 
  his own failure to call Blenkarn, who Birkett acknowledges was available to 
  testify, as a witness. Finally, it was not until closing arguments that Birkett 
  objected to AEI's reliance on the Financing Agreement on the basis that it had 
  not been pleaded by AEI.</p>
<p>
  [72] In these circumstances, Birkett cannot be heard to now complain, on the 
  basis of a deficiency in AEI's pleading, of the trial judge's consideration 
  of the Financing Agreement in determining the Cash Advances claim. The Financing 
  Agreement and other post-LOI documents were clearly 'in play' in this lawsuit 
  long before trial. Birkett was aware of the terms of the Financing Agreement 
  including, in particular, the terms of the repayment provision contained in 
  paragraph 3 of the Financing Agreement, and of their potential significance 
  at trial. Although AEI failed to amend its pleading before or at trial to refer 
  specifically to the Financing Agreement, in my view, this omission is not fatal. 
  Birkett was not prejudiced or taken by surprise by AEI's reliance on the Financing 
  Agreement. Indeed, that reliance was precipitated by Birkett's own position 
  at trial on the issue of his entitlement to reimbursement of the Cash Advances. 
  In addition, Birkett failed to pursue available options at trial to respond 
  to the Financing Agreement. The Financing Agreement was before the court and 
  neither party to this action can have been under any misapprehension concerning 
  its significance to an adjudication on the merits of Birkett's Cash Advances 
  claim. </p>
<p>
  (ii) Paragraph 3 of Financing Agreement</p>
<p>
  [73] Paragraph 3 of the Financing Agreement states that past and future advances 
  made by the WLD Group to Astris and AEI, "shall be immediately repaid once 
  [the Equity Financing] is raised by AEI, to be repaid from the proceeds of such 
  financings". Birkett asserts that this provision means that members of 
  the WLD Group are entitled to be repaid their advances to Astris or AEI, at 
  the latest by the time that the Equity Financing is in place.</p>
<p>
  [74] There are two flaws in this argument. First, the concluding language of 
  paragraph 3 indicates that advances are to be repaid "from the proceeds 
  of such financings". If the repayment of advances could be compelled prior 
  to the obtaining of the Equity Financing, this qualifying language would be 
  unnecessary and nonsensical.</p>
<p>
  [75] Second, the Financing Agreement was entered into as a condition of the 
  closing of the share exchange transaction by which AEI acquired Astris. The 
  Cash Advances had already been made, in whole or part. The purpose of the transaction, 
  from the outset, was to facilitate the obtaining of sorely needed funds for 
  Astris. Prior to the closing, AEI had no assets. After the closing, its only 
  asset was its shares in Astris. Had it been intended, as urged by Birkett, that 
  the members of the WLD Group could claim against AEI's assets at any time after 
  the closing to obtain repayment of their advances to AEI, the commercial purpose 
  of the entire transaction would be undermined. In my view, paragraph 3 of the 
  Financing Agreement is designed precisely to avoid that result.</p>
<p>
  [76] Accordingly, I conclude that the trial judge properly interpreted paragraph 
  3 of the Financing Agreement as precluding the repayment of advances made by 
  members of the WLD Group to AEI prior to the Equity Financing being in place. 
  She reasoned (at para. 24): "It was obviously critical [following the closing] 
  to clarify that the advances made to AEI were similarly not repayable until 
  financing was raised." I agree.</p>
<p>
  (iii) Enforceability of Financing Agreement</p>
<p>
  [77] Birkett's attack on the enforceability of the Financing Agreement, and 
  on the trial judge's conclusion that it was binding on Birkett, may be dealt 
  with summarily.</p>
<p>
  [78] The trial judge considered, and rejected, Birkett's argument that the Financing 
  Agreement was not binding on or enforceable against him because Blenkarn had 
  not signed it. In my view, she was correct to do so.</p>
<p>
  [79] The trial judge concluded that, properly read, the Financing Agreement 
  imposed individual, that is, several rather than joint, obligations on Birkett. 
  I agree.</p>
<p>
  [80] G.H.L. Fridman, in The Law of Contract in Canada, 4th ed. (Toronto:Carswell, 
  1999) states at 194 in the context of issues of privity of contract: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where there are several creditors or debtors, they may engage as parties to 
  the contract jointly or severally. If they are joint parties, then their obligation 
  (or benefit, as the case may be) is one and indivisible&#133;If they are several 
  parties, then the obligation or benefit is capable of severance or separation 
  as between them. It is a question of construction of the contract whether their 
  participation in the contract is joint or several [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  See also Chitty on Contracts, 28th ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1999) at 
  947.</p>
<p>
  [81] In this case, paragraph 1 of the Financing Agreement imposed an obligation 
  on Birkett to have the Trust offer 1.5 million AEI shares for sale, subject 
  to terms set by the directors of AEI. This obligation applied only to Birkett 
  and was expressed to be a personal undertaking by him. As observed by the trial 
  judge, no other member of the WLD Group was in a position to provide this undertaking; 
  nor were the other signatories to the Financing Agreement (AEI and the Astris 
  shareholders) positioned to do so. Consequently, on a plain reading of paragraph 
  1 of the Financing Agreement, the obligation created thereunder is an individual 
  obligation, personal to Birkett.</p>
<p>
  [82] Paragraph 3 of the Financing Agreement, in contrast, both conferred a benefit 
  and imposed a restriction on each of the members of the WLD Group: they were 
  entitled thereunder to the repayment of any advances made by them to AEI and 
  Astris, but only after the Equity Financing was in place. There is no suggestion 
  that if the Equity Financing was raised and the other members of the WLD Group 
  elected not to pursue recovery of their advances, Birkett would be precluded 
  from doing so. To the contrary, the Cash Advances claimed by Birkett were made 
  by him personally, and his asserted reimbursement right is similarly personal 
  to him. To the extent that other members of the WLD Group also advanced interim 
  working capital, separate obligations were thereby created.</p>
<p>
  [83] Accordingly, in my view, it cannot be said that Blenkarn's failure to sign 
  the Financing Agreement precludes enforcement of it against, or by, Birkett. 
  Rather, his obligations and benefits under the Financing Agreement are individual 
  and separately enforceable. This case is therefore distinguishable from cases 
  relied upon by Birkett in which joint property rights or obligations are created.</p>
<p>
  [84] Two other factors also support the trial judge's conclusion that Birkett 
  is bound by the Financing Agreement. First, the trial judge found as a fact 
  that Birkett, by his conduct after the execution of the Financing Agreement, 
  effectively acknowledged that he was bound by it. This finding is amply supported 
  by the evidence. Second, it will be recalled that Birkett signed the Financing 
  Agreement twice: once on behalf of AEI and once in his personal capacity. While 
  this factor alone is not determinative of the legal character of the obligations 
  and benefits created under the Financing Agreement, it is evidence of Birkett's 
  intention to be personally, and individually, bound by the Financing Agreement.</p>
<p>
  (3) Unjust Enrichment Claim: RMJ Shares Expenses</p>
<p>
  [85] On this appeal, Birkett's claim for reimbursement of the value of the RMJ 
  Shares Expenses is based on unjust enrichment and not on any of the agreements 
  entered into between the parties. Birkett does not seek to obtain shares in 
  AEI to replace the shares provided to RMJ. Rather, he seeks recovery of the 
  sum of $394,940, being the asserted value of the shares in issue.</p>
<p>
  [86] The requisite elements of an unjust enrichment cause of action are well-established. 
  The plaintiff must demonstrate: (i) an enrichment of the defendant; (ii) a corresponding 
  deprivation of the plaintiff; and (iii) the absence of any juristic reason for 
  the enrichment: see Garland v. Consumers' Gas Co., [2004] S.C.J. No. 21; Pettkus 
  v. Becker, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 834; and Campbell v. Campbell (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 
  783 (C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [87] Birkett does not dispute that the trial judge applied the proper legal 
  principles concerning unjust enrichment. Rather, he argues that she erred by 
  implicitly concluding that there was a juristic reason for Birkett's deprivation 
  in relation to the RMJ shares. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [88] The trial judge stated in connection with the RMJ Shares Expenses (at para. 
  81): </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the case of the shares transferred to RMJ, Mr. Birkett argued that the board 
  of AEI acknowledged in the minutes of its November 5, 1996 meeting that the 
  value of the work of RMJ had a value of $394,900. In those minutes, the board 
  resolved to issue 637,000 shares to Mr. Birkett to replace the shares transferred 
  by him to RMJ "at a price of 62 cents Canadian being the value placed on 
  the shares for the work." $394,000 is the product of 637,000 multiplied 
  by $.62. As I have noted above, the resolution went on, however, to provide 
  that delivery of the shares would be held pending delivery of U.S. $990,000 
  on the completion of [a securities financing in the United States]. This condition 
  on delivery is to me an acknowledgment that there was no value to AEI in the 
  work performed by RMJ unless the funding was obtained. While the share price 
  of AEI rose for several months, presumably as a result of RMJ's efforts, the 
  increase was temporary. AEI did not secure the [securities] financing or any 
  other benefit as a result. The required element of enrichment is not satisfied. 
  Even if enrichment had been found, it would not be unfair for AEI to retain 
  the benefit given the principle established in the Financing Agreement and the 
  undertaking that Mr. Birkett was to cause the proceeds of sale of shares held 
  by Hemery to be donated to AEI, the failure of Mr. Birkett to sell the Hemery 
  shares and the fact that some of the shares transferred to RMJ appear to have 
  come from Hemery [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  Birkett asserts that the last sentence in the quoted passage from the trial 
  judge's reasons is tantamount to a finding that a juristic reason existed for 
  the enrichment realized by AEI from RMJ's services. </p>
<p>
  [89] This argument does not assist Birkett. The trial judge found that the first 
  requisite element of an unjust enrichment - the enrichment of the defendant 
  - had not been established by Birkett. Once that determination was made, it 
  was unnecessary for the trial judge to consider whether the remaining elements 
  of an unjust enrichment were satisfied: the unjust enrichment claim failed.</p>
<p>
  [90] Birkett does not vigorously challenge the trial judge's finding that RMJ's 
  services yielded no benefit to AEI, other than a temporary and short-term increase 
  in the value of AEI's share price; nor does he suggest that this finding is 
  tainted by palpable and overriding error. The trial judge's finding, in my view, 
  was open to her on the evidence. </p>
<p>
  [91] Accordingly, it is unnecessary to address Birkett's argument that the trial 
  judge erred by finding that the third element of unjust enrichment - a juristic 
  reason for the enrichment of the defendant - existed. In the absence of a finding
