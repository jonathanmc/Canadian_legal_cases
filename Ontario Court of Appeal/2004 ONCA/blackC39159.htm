<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The Robinson Group Limited appeals from the judgment of Pitt J. allowing 
  Ms. Black's claim for wrongful dismissal and awarding damages in the amount 
  of $19,653.40 plus pre-judgment interest and costs. The appellants' position 
  is that Ms. Black was dismissed for just cause because she had given herself 
  and another employee unauthorized increases in salary and vacation pay. The 
  trial judge rejected this argument. He found that although &quot;in the literal 
  sense the plaintiff did not have authorization for the increases&quot;, Ms. 
  Black's conduct amounted to an indiscretion rather than dishonesty and, moreover, 
  that it was not the cause for her dismissal, but rather a pretext to justify 
  an earlier determined plan to dismiss the plaintiff as part of an overall financial 
  reorganization. Applying the contextual analysis called for and the principles 
  enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in McKinley v. BC Tel (2001), 9 C.C.L. 
  (3d) 167, the trial judge found that the defendants had not met the onus of 
  satisfying him that the dismissal was for cause. This finding was justified 
  on the evidence and we see no reason for interfering with it. </p>
<p>[2] Ms. Black cross-appealed on damages arguing that the trial judge erred 
  in basing his award on her salary as it was in 1996 before the &quot;unauthorized&quot; 
  increases. The Robinson Group argued on the other hand that the trial judge 
  erred in dismissing its counterclaim for the return of the allegedly overpaid 
  amounts. We would not interfere with either of these dispositions. While there 
  may be some inconsistencies in some of the trial judge's remarks in this regard, 
  we are satisfied that on the whole he reached a fair and proper result having 
  regard to his view of the employment relationship and the circumstances surrounding 
  the pay increases. </p>
<p>[3] The appeal and cross-appeal are, therefore, dismissed.</p>
<p>[4] The respondent is entitled to her costs of the appeal, fixed at $8,000.00 
  inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
