<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice R. Clarke of the Superior Court of Justice, 
  sitting as a summary conviction appeal judge, dated September 3, 2003, dismissing 
  an appeal from the conviction entered by Justice J. Rhys Morgan of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice on June 11, 2002 and the sentence imposed by Justice Morgan 
  dated November 4, 2002.</p>
<p>CRONK J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] On June 11, 2002, the appellant was convicted of dangerous driving contrary 
  to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced on November 4, 2002 to 
  30 days imprisonment. A one-year driving prohibition was also imposed. His summary 
  convic-tion and sentence appeal was dismissed on September 3, 2003. He appeals 
  that dismissal to this court. </p>
<p>
  (1) Facts</p>
<p>
  [2] On the evening of October 27, 1997, the appellant, an off duty police officer, 
  was driving an unmarked car eastbound on Highway 401. The appellant was not 
  in uniform. The complainant, Laurie Lee, was also driving in the same direction. 
  The appellant approached Ms. Lee's vehicle from the rear, driving at a high 
  speed. The appellant flashed his lights and moved his vehicle back and forth 
  from lane to lane, in an attempt to pass Ms. Lee. When the appellant passed 
  Ms. Lee's vehicle, he was driving at speeds between 120 to 130 kilometres per 
  hour. After passing Ms. Lee, the appellant pulled quickly in front of her and 
  lightly touched his brakes, causing Ms. Lee to react by hitting her own brakes. 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] Afterwards, when the appellant found himself again driving behind Ms. Lee's 
  vehicle, he passed her a second time on the right, abruptly and without signalling. 
  On this occasion, the appellant brought his vehicle to a full stop in front 
  of Ms. Lee's vehicle while they were both in the passing lane on Highway 401. 
  This manoeuvring caused a minor collision between the two cars. When the appellant 
  got out of his car and tried to open the door of Ms. Lee's car, Ms. Lee pulled 
  around him and drove forward on the highway. The appellant then drove up beside 
  her and flashed his police badge. Ms. Lee panicked, and called 911 from her 
  car for assistance. Both vehicles were eventually pulled over by the police. 
  The police officers who attended the scene testified that, when they approached 
  the appellant, he was angry, used obscene language and tried to assault one 
  of the officers. </p>
<p>
  [4] Justice J. Rhys Morgan of the Ontario Court of Justice found the appellant 
  guilty of the offence of dangerous driving and imposed a sentence of 30 days 
  imprisonment as well as a one-year driving prohibition. On September 3, 2003, 
  Clarke J. of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting as a summary conviction 
  appeal judge, dismissed the appellant's appeal against conviction and the sentence 
  imposed.</p>
<p>
  (2) Conviction Appeal</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant argues that the trial judge erred by misstating and misapplying 
  the test for dangerous driving and that the summary conviction appeal judge, 
  in turn, erred in the same fashion.</p>
<p>
  [6] The trial judge framed the applicable test as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I must be satisfied that the conduct amounted to a marked departure from the 
  standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the position of [the 
  appellant]. Put another way, would a reasonable person in similar circumstances, 
  have been aware of the risk and of the danger of the conduct that is in issue?</p>
<p>
  The trial judge's formulation of the test thus referenced both a "marked 
  departure" from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe 
  in a similar position and an "awareness of the risk and&#133;the danger" 
  of the challenged conduct.</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant acknowledges before this court that the trial judge's expression 
  of the test for dangerous driving derived from R. v. Hundal (1993), 79 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 97 (S.C.C.). In that case, Cory J. confirmed that the applicable test is 
  a modified objective one, and stated at p. 108: </p>
<p class="indent"> It follows then that a trier of fact may convict if satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that, viewed objectively, the accused was, in the 
  words of the section, driving in a manner that was "dangerous to the public, 
  having regard to all the circumstances, including the nature, condition and 
  use of such place and the amount of traffic that at the time is or might reasonably 
  be expected to be on such place". In making the assessment, the trier of fact 
  should be satisfied that the conduct amounted to a marked departure from the 
  standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused's situation.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, if an explanation is offered by the accused, such as a 
  sudden and unexpected onset of illness, then in order to convict, the trier 
  of fact must be satisfied that a reasonable person in similar circumstances 
  ought to have been aware of the risk and of the danger involved in the conduct 
  manifested by the accused [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant argues that these passages establish that there are two separate 
  and distinct components to the test for dangerous driving: (i) a "marked 
  departure from the standard" component, for the purpose of determining 
  whether the Crown has established the actus reus of the offence; and (ii) if 
  - and only if - the actus reus has been made out, a "risk awareness" 
  component, for the purpose of determining whether a reasonable person in similar 
  circumstances ought to have been aware of the risk and of the danger involved 
  in the accused's conduct. The appellant submits that the second component is 
  directed at the accused's explanation for his or her driving, while the first 
  component is concerned with the driving itself. He maintains that he did not 
  offer an explanation for his driving in this case in the same sense as contemplated 
  in Hundal. Consequently, he submits, when the trial judge referenced both a 
  "marked departure from the standard" and "risk awareness" 
  in his articulation of the test for dangerous driving, he conflated two separate 
  and different components into one merged test, having the effective result of 
  lowering the evidential threshold that the Crown must meet in order to support 
  a conviction for dangerous driving.</p>
<p>
  [9] Finally, the appellant argues that the summary conviction appeal judge erred 
  by accepting the trial judge's description of the test for dangerous driving. 
  In that connection, the summary conviction appeal judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The appellant further argues that the learned trial judge misdirected himself 
  respecting the appropriate test to be applied in a case of dangerous driving. 
  The appellant argues that the learned trial judge applied a test commensurate 
  with the civil standard applicable to the tort of negligence&#133;It is particularly 
  evident to me that the learned trial judge properly directed himself in as much 
  as the words said to support the appellant's position are themselves taken from 
  R. v. Hundal, the seminal case on point and, further, that they follow directly 
  from a passage in which both parties agree the trial judge correctly stated 
  the test. Further, the word "marked" is defined in the Concise Oxford 
  English Dictionary as, inter alia, "clearly noticeable." On my reasoning 
  of this record the driving complained of was indeed clearly noticed by two witnesses 
  independent each of the other. Accordingly, I find there was an ample body of 
  evidence from which the learned trial judge could make the finding he did in 
  respect of the driving.</p>
<p>
  [10] I would not give effect to the appellant's submissions, for several reasons.</p>
<p>
  [11] First, although the summary conviction appeal judge's reasons were not 
  directly responsive to the appellant's argument concerning the nature of the 
  trial judge's alleged misstatement of the test for dangerous driving, a proper 
  reading of Hundal indicates that the trial judge did not misstate or misapply 
  the requisite test. In my view, application of the "risk awareness" 
  component of the test set out in Hundal is not limited to the circumstances 
  posited by the appellant. Rather, the passages from Hundal relied upon by the 
  appellant, as quoted above, must be read together. Consideration of whether 
  a reasonable person in similar circumstances ought to have been aware of the 
  risk and the danger involved in the conduct of an accused forms part of the 
  trier of fact's overall inquiry into the context of all the events surrounding 
  the incident giving rise to the charge of dangerous driving. As Cory J. pointed 
  out in Hundal at p. 108: "[T]he mens rea for the offence of dangerous driving 
  should be assessed objectively but in the context of all the events surrounding 
  the incident. That approach will satisfy the dictates both of common sense and 
  fairness."</p>
<p>
  [12] Acceptance of the interpretation of Hundal urged by the appellant would 
  result in two different tests for dangerous driving: the "marked departure 
  from the standard" test in those cases where an accused offers no explanation 
  for his or her driving and a different test - the "marked departure from 
  the standard" test augmented by "awareness of the risk" - in 
  those cases where an accused advances an explanation for his or her conduct. 
  In my view, the reasoning in Hundal does not compel or invite such disparate 
  interpretative results.</p>
<p>
  [13] Second, and in any event, I do not agree that the appellant offered no 
  explanation to excuse his conduct, in the sense contemplated by Hundal. The 
  appellant claimed at trial that he was the victim of dangerous driving by the 
  complainant, that she refused to let him pass, that after he passed her the 
  complainant sped up and hit his vehicle from the rear, that he pursued her and 
  flashed his lights and subsequently his police badge at her in an effort to 
  cause her to stop her vehicle, and that he followed police procedures for stopping 
  a motor vehicle for the purpose of investigating dangerous driving. Those elements 
  of the appellant's version of events entitled the trial judge to inquire whether 
  a reasonable person, in similar circumstances, ought to have been aware of the 
  risk and the danger involved in the conduct manifested by the appellant. The 
  trial judge was required on the appellant's own evidence to consider the appellant's 
  explanation of the events in question. </p>
<p>
  [14] Third, and contrary to the appellant's submissions, the trial judge did 
  not use the "risk awareness" component of the test for dangerous driving 
  as an alternative to the "marked departure from standard" component 
  of the test. To the contrary, the trial judge's reasons indicate that he addressed 
  both components of the test and assessed the appellant's conduct in accordance 
  with those components.</p>
<p>
  [15] Finally, even if the trial judge erred in his articulation of the test 
  for dangerous driving, in my view this is a proper case for the application 
  of s. 686 (1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. </p>
<p>
  [16] The facts as found by the trial judge clearly support the conclusion that 
  the appellant's driving was a marked departure from the standard of care that 
  a reasonable person would observe in the appellant's situation. Those facts 
  include the following. The appellant came to a full stop in his vehicle on Highway 
  401, one of the busiest roadways in Ontario, at about dusk. Other motorists 
  were on the highway, which was under construction. The appellant's conduct endangered 
  both the complainant and other drivers. It also left the complainant, understandably, 
  in a pronounced state of panic and fear. In that context, as indicated by the 
  summary conviction appeal judge, the conduct of the appellant was a clearly 
  noticeable and marked departure from the applicable driving standard. It also 
  exposed the appellant, the complainant and third parties to the risk of serious 
  injury. Accordingly, the verdict inevitably would have been the same and, in 
  my opinion, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred in this 
  case.</p>
<p>
  [17] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appellant's conviction appeal.</p>
<p>
  (3) Sentence Appeal</p>
<p>
  [18] In support of his sentence appeal, the appellant argues that the trial 
  judge erred in the following ways: (i) by failing to consider and credit the 
  appellant for time served by him in jail in relation to this offence; (ii) by 
  treating the appellant's conduct as an abuse of his position and trust as a 
  police officer; and (iii) by failing to impose a non-custodial sentence given 
  the particular circumstances of this offender.</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  (i) Credit for Time Served</p>
<p>
  [19] Crown counsel candidly acknowledged on this appeal that the appellant should 
  have been credited for 10 days of time served in jail and that the trial judge's 
  failure to accord such credit was an error in principle. In his reasons, the 
  summary conviction appeal judge made no express mention of the time served by 
  the appellant, holding only that the "sentence reflects&#133;no error in 
  principle and is not manifestly unfit".</p>
<p>
  [20] The appellant was charged with dangerous driving in October 1997. His first 
  trial resulted in a conviction but on appeal a new trial was ordered. He served 
  10 days in jail following his conviction at his first trial and before he was 
  granted bail pending appeal. The 10 days served by the appellant after his first 
  sentence hearing were directly attributable to the charge of dangerous driving 
  at issue on this appeal. In these circumstances, the appellant ought to have 
  been given credit for 10 days of time served, on a one-for-one basis.</p>
<p>
  (ii) Breach of Trust</p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant next argues that the summary conviction appeal judge erred 
  in law by relying on R. v. G. (V.M.), [1988] O.J. No. 984 (Ont. Dist. Ct.) and 
  R. v. Cusack (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 289 (N.S.C.A.) to conclude that the trial 
  judge did not err in principle in arriving at an appropriate sentence in this 
  case. The appellant points out that G. (V.M.) and Cusack, unlike the case at 
  bar, both involved the sentencing of police officers for offences that involved 
  a clear breach of trust and abuse of their positions and the offences were committed 
  while the officers were on duty. He submits that these cases have no application 
  here, because the appellant was not on duty at the time of the offence and the 
  offence itself involved no breach of trust. He maintains that his use of his 
  police badge was, at worse, poor judgment.</p>
<p>
  [22] I disagree. The trial judge found that, "[T]he appellant's conduct 
  was wilful, unnecessary, born out of anger, the conduct persisted for some time, 
  he inappropriately flashed his badge, he exposed Miss Lee and other users of 
  the highway to unnecessary risk, injury or damage." The summary conviction 
  appeal judge correctly observed that sentencing principles are concerned, in 
  part, with protecting the public from offences by persons who are entrusted 
  by the community with special authority under the law. </p>
<p>
  [23] The appellant admitted that he used his police badge in an effort to compel 
  the complainant to stop her vehicle. Indeed, he claimed that although he was 
  technically "off-duty", he came "on-duty" as soon as he 
  waved his badge out of his car window and that he was entitled to do so because 
  he was contemplating making an arrest for dangerous driving. This position is 
  unsustainable and highly self-serving. The appellant's use of his badge was 
  clearly intended to engage his status as a police officer for the purpose of 
  exercising control over another person during a serious outburst of road "rage". 
  Its use in the circumstances was a clear abuse of the appellant's position of 
  authority and trust as a police officer. The record before us unequivocally 
  establishes that this conduct caused stark disbelief in the complainant and 
  materially contributed to her panic and anxiety. She told the police during 
  her call from her car for assistance that, "I didn't think he was a police 
  officer, I thought if it is a police badge it's a phoney police badge and that 
  was even more scary."</p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant's use of his police badge was an important factor, among 
  many, to be considered by the sentencing judge. The summary conviction appeal 
  judge did not err in his consideration of this factor; nor did he err in implicitly 
  concluding that the trial judge appropriately considered this factor.</p>
<p>
  (iii) Request for a Non-Custodial Sentence</p>
<p>
  [25] The appellant argues that, in all the circumstances of this case, a conditional 
  discharge is the appropriate disposition. He emphasizes that a custodial term 
  of any duration will have serious consequences for him, as a police officer. 
  In particular, the appellant was dismissed from his employment as a police officer 
  in June 2002 as a result of this offence and it is said that the chances for 
  reinstatement of his employment as a police officer will be considerably lessened, 
  if not eliminated, if he is required to go to jail.</p>
<p>
  [26] The appellant also points out that he has no criminal record and that he 
  has been on bail for almost six years without re-offending. As well, although 
  the offence in this case was serious, the appellant submits that no injuries 
  or property damage resulted and his conduct was out-of-character. Moreover, 
  after crediting the time served by him in jail on a one-for-one basis, the appellant 
  has already served 10 days of the 30-day sentence imposed by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [27] Finally, the appellant asserts that a conditional discharge is not contrary 
  to the public interest and is in his interests. </p>
<p>
  [28] Notwithstanding the able submissions of counsel for the appellant, this 
  argument must fail. I reach that conclusion for the following reasons.</p>
<p>
  [29] First, there is no suggestion that the trial judge erred in declining to 
  impose a non-custodial sentence, or that he failed to consider a conditional 
  discharge. In that connection, the trial judge held that: "The only sentence 
  that is appropriate is a short jail sentence to measure this court's denunciation 
  of this type of driving." Moreover, the trial judge reduced the length 
  of the custodial sentence that he imposed expressly to reflect the fact that 
  no damage was occasioned by the appellant's conduct, and the fact that at the 
  date of the sentence hearing, the appellant had been on bail for a lengthy period 
  without further incident.</p>
<p>
  [30] Second, and importantly, the trial judge held that the appellant's conduct 
  endangered the public. The trial judge, in lengthy and comprehensive reasons 
  for sentence, found that the appellant was driving in an aggressive fashion 
  before he encountered Ms. Lee's vehicle, that he was driving at a high rate 
  of speed, that he was flashing his lights, that he was moving his vehicle abruptly, 
  and that he was tailgating. This pattern of driving continued after the appellant 
  encountered Ms. Lee's vehicle. In addition, the appellant braked his own car 
  twice and, on the second occasion, came to a full stop in the passing lane of 
  a multi-lane high speed highway, thereby exposing Ms. Lee and the travelling 
  public to the risk of serious injury. As well, as I have said, the appellant 
  also used his police badge in an attempt to stop Ms. Lee's vehicle. Based on 
  these facts, in my view, the grant of a discharge in this case would be contrary 
  to the public interest and would not accord with the need for general deterrence.</p>
<p>
  [31] I also note that, at trial, the Crown sought a custodial sentence in the 
  range of 30 to 90 days, while the defence sought an absolute or conditional 
  discharge. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was at the lowest end of 
  the custodial range proposed by the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [32] The summary conviction appeal judge took into account the implications 
  of a custodial sentence on the appellant's career as a police officer. He concluded 
  that, "[T]he learned trial judge gave appropriate consideration to all 
  relevant factors. The sentence reflects, in my view, no error in principle and 
  is not manifestly unfit." I agree.</p>
<p>
  (4) Disposition</p>
<p>
  [33] For the reasons given, I would dismiss the conviction appeal, grant leave 
  to appeal sentence and allow the sentence appeal, in part, by varying the sentence 
  imposed to credit the appellant on a one-for-one basis for the 10 days in jail 
  served by him following his first trial. In the result, the sentence is reduced 
  from 30 days to 20 days imprisonment. The one-year driving prohibition imposed 
  by the trial judge remains unchanged.</p>
