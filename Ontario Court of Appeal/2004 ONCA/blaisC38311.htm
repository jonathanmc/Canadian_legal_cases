<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice C. Raymond Harris of the Superior 
  Court of Justice on May 7, 2002.</p>

<p>
  ROSENBERG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant appeals from his conviction by Harris J. following two separate 
  trials commencing in March and May 2002. The results of both trials turned on 
  rulings made by the trial judge concerning the appellant's rights under s. 11(b) 
  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the admissibility of evidence 
  seized pursuant to a wiretap authorization and three search warrants. Despite 
  the appellant's counsels' very able argument, I have concluded that the appeals 
  must be dismissed. I will briefly address each of the submissions made by the 
  appellant.</p>
<p>
  UNREASONABLE DELAY</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant submitted that his right to a trial within a reasonable time 
  as guaranteed by s. 11(b) of the Charter was violated because of the 23 months 
  from the time the first set of charges was laid until the trial date. The trial 
  judge recognized that this delay required explanation. He carefully examined 
  the causes of the delay and applied the balancing test as laid down in R. v. 
  Morin (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). The trial judge found that only a relatively 
  short delay was caused by the conduct of the Crown. In this court, the appellant 
  takes issue with this finding and submits that the trial judge erred in failing 
  to recognize the impact of the last minute joinder of the appellant with his 
  co-accused. The appellant submits that this had a cascading effect and led to 
  substantial delays in the Ontario Court of Justice before the preliminary inquiry 
  was completed.</p>
<p>
  [3] Having regard to the chronology, I cannot say that the trial judge's view 
  of the impact of the joinder decision was unreasonable. As a result of the laying 
  of the new information, the September court days were lost. However, new dates 
  were set in early November and the preliminary inquiry commenced at that time. 
  Thereafter, the preliminary inquiry proceeded sporadically as it became necessary 
  to find new dates for continuation. As the trial judge recognized, this was 
  a complex case involving multiple charges. The appellant put the Crown at the 
  preliminary inquiry to strict proof of the provenance and continuity of the 
  many exhibits. This was his right, but it had an impact on the scheduling of 
  the preliminary inquiry. In the result, the original time estimate, apparently 
  of three days, proved woefully unrealistic. I am not persuaded that the trial 
  judge placed insufficient weight on the Crown's late decision to join up the 
  appellant with his co-accused.</p>
<p>
  [4] While the time spent in the Ontario Court of Justice to complete the preliminary 
  inquiry was lengthy, once the appellant was ordered to stand trial, the case 
  proceeded very quickly and was ready for trial within a few months. There was 
  some real prejudice to the appellant in that he was in custody during this time. 
  However, a significant portion of the time was attributable to sentences that 
  were imposed while he was awaiting trial. The trial judge's application of the 
  balancing test was reasonable. I would therefore not give effect to this ground 
  of appeal.</p>
<p>
  WIRETAP EVIDENCE</p>
<p>
  Interpretation of s. 186(2) of the Criminal Code</p>
<p>
  [5] Following the arrest of the appellant and several others, the police obtained 
  an authorization to intercept the communications of the appellant and others 
  at four of the ranges at the Hamilton Wentworth Detention Centre and the visitation 
  area at the Centre. The primary focus of the investigation at that time was 
  a homicide. The police were also investigating various break-ins and a conspiracy 
  to commit break and enter. Pursuant to the authorization, the police installed 
  wiretap devices on the telephones on the ranges. The appellant submits that 
  the authorization was granted in violation of s. 186(2) of the Criminal Code, 
  which provides as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  s. 186(2) No authorization may be given to intercept a private communication 
  at the office or residence of a solicitor, or at any other place ordinarily 
  used by a solicitor and by other solicitors for the purpose of consultation 
  with clients, unless the judge to whom the application is made is satisfied 
  that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the solicitor, any other solicitor 
  practising with him, any person employed by him or any other such solicitor 
  or a member of the solicitor's household has been or is about to become a party 
  to an offence [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant submits that the telephones on the detention centre ranges 
  fall within the emphasized portion of the section being places &quot;ordinarily 
  used by a solicitor and by other solicitors for the purpose of consultation 
  with clients&quot;. I do not agree with that submission. Inmates awaiting trial 
  may resort to a jail telephone to consult with their lawyers, but the telephone 
  is not a &quot;place&quot; ordinarily used by a solicitor for the purpose of 
  consultation with clients any more than the telephone in an accused's home or 
  office is such a place. The words of the section must be interpreted having 
  regard to their ordinary meaning in the context of the scheme and purpose of 
  the legislation. The context indicates that the focus of the subsection is on 
  places where lawyers may be when they ordinarily consult with clients, not where 
  the clients may happen to be. Thus, the private interview rooms in the jail 
  where lawyers consult with clients would fall within s. 186(2) as would, for 
  example, the lawyer's own mobile telephone. But telephones on the ranges in 
  the jail are not places ordinarily used by solicitors.</p>
<p>
  [7] The authorizing judge did recognize that there was a high probability that 
  accused awaiting trial would use the range telephones to call their lawyers 
  and he imposed strict conditions. Thus, the telephones had to be live monitored 
  and whenever an inmate made a call to a solicitor the monitor was required to 
  stop listening and stop recording and was only permitted to check periodically 
  to ensure that the call was still to a solicitor. These conditions struck an 
  appropriate balance to ensure that the important interest in solicitor client 
  confidentiality was respected.</p>
<p>
  Investigative necessity</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant submits that the investigative necessity requirement in s. 
  186(1)(b) was not made out. While this argument was made in relation to both 
  the homicide and break and enter investigations, the substantial focus of the 
  appellant's submission was on the break and enter investigation. The affidavit 
  of Detective Sergeant MacLeod is lengthy and detailed. He set out the steps 
  taken to attempt to continue the investigation including the use of informants, 
  undercover officers, surveillance, search warrants and other investigative means. 
  In my view, it was open to the trial judge to find that the investigative necessity 
  requirement had been made out in the sense that there was &quot;practically 
  speaking, no other reasonable alternative method of investigation, in the circumstances 
  of the particular criminal inquiry&quot;. See R. v. Araujo (2000), 149 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at para. 29. It is apparent from the affidavit that the homicide 
  and conspiracy investigations were at a standstill. Suggestions by defence counsel 
  that a possible co-accused be extradited from the United States and that the 
  police put an undercover officer into the jail were not practical alternatives 
  in the context of this particular investigation.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant, however, relies upon the amplified record and, in particular, 
  Detective Sergeant MacLeod's testimony in which he agreed with the suggestion 
  of defence counsel that the &quot;wiretaps weren't really a necessity for the 
  break and enters&quot;. The trial judge carefully examined this testimony along 
  with the other evidence given by the officer. He concluded that the officer's 
  answer to this one question did not derogate from the other information that 
  showed that investigative necessity had been met with respect to conspiracy 
  and accessory after the fact to break and enter. This conclusion was reasonably 
  open on the facts and accordingly, investigative necessity was made out on the 
  homicide, and conspiracy to break and enter investigations. In those circumstances, 
  it becomes unnecessary to decide whether the holding in R. v. Commisso (1983), 
  7 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) applies in the post-Charter context.</p>
<p>
  Reasonable grounds</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant submits that the affidavit in support of the authorization, 
  as amplified on the hearing before the trial judge, failed to show that there 
  were reasonable grounds to believe that interception of the appellant's private 
  communications at the detention centre would result in the obtaining of evidence 
  concerning the homicide or the break and enter conspiracy. There were certainly 
  concerns with this aspect of the investigation. The police were aware that the 
  main suspects were in jail and being kept on separate ranges. It was unlikely 
  that wiretaps on the telephones would result in incriminating conversations 
  between the detainees. However, in his affidavit, Detective Sergeant MacLeod 
  set out a plan that he believed would stimulate conversation not only amongst 
  the detainees but between the detainees and the unknown perpetrators and with 
  the detainees' family members about the offences. The standard of review before 
  the trial judge was a narrow one; if the authorizing judge could have granted 
  the authorization then the trial judge should not interfere. In my view, the 
  authorizing judge could have granted the authorization. The investigative plan 
  together with the other material provided a basis for a belief, beyond a mere 
  hope, that evidence would be obtained.</p>
<p>
  SEARCH WARRANTS</p>
<p>
  The seizure of the key</p>
<p>
  [11] Following the appellant's arrest and incarceration at the detention centre, 
  the appellant's personal belongings were seized by the jail authorities and 
  placed in a sealed but transparent plastic bag. Some time later, the police 
  seized a key from a co-accused that opened the door to the residence where some 
  of the stolen goods were stored. As a result, Detective Hahn went to the detention 
  centre to view the appellant's belongings. The jail authorities permitted him 
  to look at the belongings through the bag but he was not permitted to open the 
  bag or take it away. Detective Hahn saw a key that resembled the key taken from 
  the co-accused. He returned a second time with the co-accused's key and again, 
  through the bag, compared it to the key seized from the appellant. Having satisfied 
  himself that the keys were likely the same, Detective Hahn then obtained a warrant 
  to seize the key.</p>
<p> [12] The appellant submits that the two inspections of the plastic bag by 
  Detective Hahn were unreasonable searches akin to the warrantless perimeter 
  searches found to be unreasonable by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Grant 
  (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 173 (S.C.C.). The appellant submits that this tainted 
  the search warrant later used to seize the key. In my view, this is not an apt 
  analogy. The search conducted in Grant was of the accused's private dwelling 
  in which he had a reasonable expectation of privacy. In this case, once the 
  state had seized his belongings, the appellant had a greatly reduced expectation 
  of privacy.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> In R. v. Edwards (1996), 104 
  C.C.C. (3d) 136 (S.C.C.) at 150?51, Cory J. set out the factors a court should 
  consider in determining whether a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The factors to be considered in assessing the totality of the circumstances 
  may include, but are not restricted to, the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) presence at the time of the search;</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) possession or control of the property or place searched;</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) ownership of the property or place;</p>
<p class="indent"> (iv) historical use of the property or item;</p>
<p class="indent"> (v) the ability to regulate access, including the right to 
  admit or exclude others from the place;</p>
<p class="indent"> (vi) the existence of a subjective expectation of privacy; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent"> (vii) the objective reasonableness of the expectation.</p>
<p> [13] Considering those circumstances, in my view, the appellant's expectation 
  of privacy was that the state would preserve the goods and return them to him 
  upon his release. He could not reasonably expect that agents of the state would 
  not inspect those goods, although he could expect that the police would obtain 
  a search warrant before actually taking them out of the possession of the gaoler 
  who was under a duty to safeguard them. This is exactly what Detective Hahn 
  did in this case and I therefore see no violation of s. 8. Even if there was, 
  this is manifestly a case where the evidence would not be excluded under s. 
  24(2) of the Charter given the obvious good faith by the officer and his attempts 
  to comply with the law.</p>
<p>
  The 718 Cannon warrant</p>
<p>
  [14] The appellant attacks the validity of this search warrant principally on 
  the basis that the affiant, Detective Hahn, failed to make full disclosure to 
  the justice of the peace of frailties with the credibility of the confidential 
  informer. The trial judge fully reviewed those omissions as revealed in the 
  voir dire. He excised parts from the affidavit to conform with the evidence 
  as disclosed on the voir dire but concluded that there still remained a basis 
  upon which the warrant could have been granted. He also found that Detective 
  Hahn was not attempting to mislead in his affidavit and acted in good faith. 
  Those findings were reasonably open on the record and therefore there is no 
  basis for interfering with the trial judge's conclusion that the warrant was 
  valid.</p>
<p>
  The Queen Street warrant</p>
<p>
  [15] The appellant submits that the material in the information to obtain this 
  warrant did not demonstrate that there were reasonable grounds to believe that 
  the property sought to be seized would provide evidence of the break and enters. 
  In my view, there was compelling evidence set out in the information from which 
  the justice of the peace could conclude that there was a link between the offences 
  and the goods in the apartment. The warrant was therefore valid.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [16] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeals from conviction. In accordance 
  with counsel's submission at the hearing of the appeal, the appeal from sentence 
  is dismissed as abandoned.</p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> There was no suggestion that the initial 
  seizure of the goods was unlawful or unreasonable. Such seizures are authorized 
  by regulations made pursuant to Ministry of Correctional Services Act. See R.R.O. 
  1990, Reg. 778, s.10.</p>
