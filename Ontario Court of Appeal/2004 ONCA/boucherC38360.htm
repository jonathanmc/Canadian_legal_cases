<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice John G. Kerr of the Superior 
  Court of Justice on May 15, 2002. </p>
<p>
  SIMMONS J.A.: </p>
<p> [1] Following a three-day trial, Kerr J. convicted the respondent of attempting 
  to murder his estranged wife and of two counts of uttering threats to kill her<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a>. 
  On the attempted murder charge, in addition to twenty-eight months credit for 
  time served, the trial judge sentenced the respondent to two years less a day 
  imprisonment plus two years of probation, recommended that the respondent receive 
  counselling while incarcerated and ordered that the respondent accept and continue 
  counselling while on probation. On the uttering death threats charges, the trial 
  judge sentenced the respondent to 30 days imprisonment on each count, to be 
  served concurrently.</p>
<p>
  [2] The Crown appeals against the sentence imposed for attempted murder. </p>
<p>
  [3] The main issue on appeal is whether the sentence imposed is unfit because 
  it is below the range of sentences established by this court for a planned and 
  deliberate attempted murder committed in a domestic context. </p>
<p>
  I. Background</p>
<p>
  i) the offence</p>
<p>
  [4] On March 20, 2001, the respondent telephoned his estranged wife (the "complainant"), 
  who was then living in London, Ontario, from his home in St. Thomas. The telephone 
  call lasted about five minutes and ended when the complainant hung up. The respondent 
  tried to call her again but she would not answer the phone. The complainant 
  testified that she did not want to speak to the respondent because they had 
  argued in the past on the telephone over the fact that she left him. She also 
  testified that the respondent had previously threatened her and her son David.</p>
<p>
  [5] Following the telephone call, the respondent went to his kitchen and got 
  out a knife with a blade about eight inches long. The respondent testified that 
  he got the knife in order to cut some meat. However, the respondent's son Terrence 
  was present. He either took the knife from the respondent, or took charge of 
  the knife when the respondent put it down. At one point the respondent said 
  that he couldn't take it anymore and that he no longer wished to live. The trial 
  judge found that Terrence may have felt that the respondent was going to harm 
  himself.</p>
<p>
  [6] The respondent told Terrence that his wife "was either going to come 
  home or she was going to go to her grave". After Terrence took the knife, 
  the respondent put on his shoes and his coat and drove away in the direction 
  of London.</p>
<p>
  [7] Both Terrence and the respondent testified that, before he left for London, 
  the respondent had been drinking. The trial judge found that there was some 
  question about the respondent's state of intoxication, but noted that the respondent 
  was sufficiently sober to be able to drive to London and locate his wife's apartment. 
  At some point after the respondent arrived in the vicinity of her apartment, 
  the complainant left her apartment and spotted the respondent near a fence with 
  a metal bar in his hand. The respondent did not see the complainant immediately 
  so she walked quickly to her car. As she was getting into the car, the respondent 
  ran towards her from behind a hedge, reached out for the car and raised the 
  metal bar he was holding to just below his shoulder.</p>
<p>
  [8] The complainant managed to get into her car and drive away. However she 
  noticed the respondent following her in his Cadillac. At one point, she stopped 
  for a traffic light. The respondent pulled in behind her. After she made a left-hand 
  turn, the respondent drove his car into her blind spot and then struck her vehicle, 
  causing it to spin. However, once she came to a stop, she was able to drive 
  away uninjured. She did not see her husband again that evening. She testified 
  at trial that she was going about 70 kilometres an hour prior to the collision. 
  Although she thought her vehicle spun about three times, an accident reconstruction 
  specialist testified that, in his opinion, it only rotated once.</p>
<p>
  [9] After hitting the complainant's car with his vehicle, the respondent swerved 
  off the east shoulder of the road and into a ditch. He got out of the ditch 
  and later telephoned his daughter-in-law. In a rambling conversation, he told 
  her that he had been in an accident with his car. However, he also said that 
  he ran the complainant off the road, that he tried to kill her, and that he 
  intended to go back to her place and finish the job. He said that he had nothing 
  to live for and threatened to kill himself.</p>
<p>
  [10] The respondent testified that he simply wanted to talk to the complainant 
  about their pending divorce and that he did not know where she lived. The trial 
  judge found his evidence incredible and not worthy of belief.</p>
<p>
  [11] Based on the evidence adduced at trial, the trial judge was satisfied that 
  the respondent formed the specific intent to murder the complainant. He said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Under all of these circumstances, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that 
  he hit her motor vehicle that evening with an ill-advised and futile but specific 
  attempt to murder her.</p>
<p>
  ...</p>
<p>
  Clearly, as I have mentioned, there was the element of alcohol in the events 
  of that day. But I am not satisfied that his level of intoxication was such 
  that he was incapable of forming the specific intent to kill his wife.</p>
<p>
  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did have that capacity. And I 
  am satisfied, as I have mentioned, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he did in 
  fact form the specific intent to kill her. The effect of the alcohol probably 
  did reduce his inhibitions in this respect, but that's all it did. ...</p>
<p>
  ii) the offender</p>
<p>
  [12] At the time of the sentence hearing, the respondent was fifty-three years 
  of age. He had previously led what defence counsel described as a "pro-social 
  life" and did not have a criminal record. He was described as a very good 
  employee who worked extremely long hours for over twenty years at Ford Motor 
  Company.</p>
<p>
  [13] The respondent and his wife were married for approximately twenty-seven 
  years. During the course of the marriage the respondent suffered from an alcohol 
  addiction, but was able to abstain for many years after his wife confronted 
  him about the issue. As a result of the events forming the subject matter of 
  the charges, the respondent's sons terminated all contact with him.</p>
<p>
  [14] A pre-sentence report was prepared for the sentence hearing. The author 
  noted that the respondent "speaks of having given up his obsession with 
  [the complainant], and feels he can now move on in life". However, the 
  author also said,</p>
<p>
  Although he appears to be able to manage his thought processes better under 
  medication, it appears that he is still in need of extensive counselling, in 
  order to become emotionally balanced again.</p>
<p>
  [15] In addition to the pre-sentence report, the defence filed a psychiatric 
  report addressing the respondent's psychological status and, in particular, 
  his attitude to his wife and the termination of their relationship. The psychiatrist 
  opined that the respondent likely falls within the category of a rejected stalker 
  subtype. He said that while the duration of stalking tends to be relatively 
  long for this subtype, "it is also one of the subtypes that comprises a 
  group of individuals who often respond to the threat or imposition of judicial 
  sanctions" and that "therapeutic interventions can play a role in 
  preventing relapse". The psychiatrist concluded, "At the time of this 
  examination, [the respondent] appears to be accepting of the fact that his relationship 
  with his wife is permanently finished."</p>
<p>
  [16] The respondent spent almost fourteen months in pre-sentence custody. Eight 
  weeks of the fourteen months was served during a labour disruption. On one occasion, 
  the respondent was assaulted in his cell while awaiting a court appearance.</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  iii) the trial judge's reasons for sentence</p>
<p>
  [17] The trial judge rejected the defence psychiatrist's conclusion that the 
  respondent "has reached the stage of acknowledgment that his marriage relationship 
  is completely finished". He noted the importance of protecting the respondent's 
  wife, but said "there is no guarantee that incarceration alone, even for 
  a lengthy period, will be effective to achieve permanent protection". The 
  trial judge expressed a concern that "without some form of treatment, [the 
  respondent] ... will persist with his delusion that by force he can compel his 
  wife to reconcile with him". He concluded: </p>
<p class="indent"> I am further concerned that even if I were to accede to the 
  Crown's submission and I sentenced the accused to a period of incarceration 
  of eight years say, but with time off for good behaviour, an early parole, and 
  so forth, [the respondent] would be released from custody well in advance of 
  such a sentence and without having received any treatment for his delusion, 
  and with no strings on him, free to pursue his assaultive behaviour.</p>
<p class="indent">For that reason it is my view that it would be more suitable 
  to have a shorter period of incarceration, but to have a string on him for a 
  more lengthy period. And that can be accomplished by a period of incarceration, 
  in addition to the time he has already served, of two years less a day followed 
  by a probationary period of two years. Such a sentence would equate to a period 
  of incarceration of something in excess of four years, and would permit me to 
  impose the two-year probationary period following that custodial sentence. That 
  will enable the Provincial authorities to keep control and to monitor [the respondent] 
  for period of four years from the present day.</p>
<p class="indent">The offence for which he has been convicted, while very serious 
  ... was the first time he has actually offered any serious violence to her, 
  although he has threatened her. He has now gone on to carry that threat into 
  action. I am, however, hopeful in that the offence itself did not involve the 
  use of a weapon, apart from the motor vehicle, such as a knife or a gun as do 
  so many of the cases cited by counsel. And notwithstanding the gravity of the 
  offence, it did not result in any injury to [the complainant], although she 
  is terrified by his behaviour... .</p>
<p class="indent">So I am of the view that the case before me on its particular 
  facts does not call for the type of custodial sentence, not only because of 
  the facts of the case but also for the reasons of control over the accused that 
  I have mentioned ... that have been outlined in the cases cited by the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [18] In the result, on the attempted murder conviction, the trial judge sentenced 
  the respondent to two years less a day imprisonment, in addition to credit for 
  time served of twenty-eight months, plus two years probation. The trial judge 
  also recommended that the respondent receive counselling while incarcerated 
  and ordered that the respondent accept and continue counselling while on probation.</p>
<p>
  II. Analysis</p>
<p>
  [19] The Crown submits that this court has established a range of sentence extending 
  from approximately eight-and-one-half years imprisonment to life imprisonment 
  for a planned and deliberate attempted murder committed in the context of a 
  domestic relationship. Accordingly, the sentence imposed in this case is manifestly 
  unfit. Further, the trial judge did not give sufficient weight to the need to 
  denounce the respondent's conduct in attempting to force the complainant to 
  return to a relationship that she was trying to escape. </p>
<p>
  [20] Contrary to the Crown's submission, the respondent contends that there 
  is a wide disparity in the range of sentences imposed for attempted murder. 
  In this case, the sentence imposed appropriately reflected the gravity of the 
  offence, the absence of any physical injury to the complainant, the fact that 
  the respondent did not have a prior criminal record, and the respondent's potential 
  for rehabilitation. In addition, the respondent submits that the cases relied 
  on by the Crown universally involve actual physical injuries. Here, there were 
  no such injuries. Moreover, the trial judge was careful in crafting a sentence 
  that he believed would afford maximum protection to the complainant by ensuring 
  that the respondent receives appropriate treatment and the sentence imposed 
  is entitled to deference.</p>
<p> [21] I agree that the authorities relied on by the Crown demonstrate that 
  this court has upheld sentences ranging from eight-and-one-half years imprisonment 
  to life imprisonment for attempted murders committed in a domestic context<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a>. 
  The authorities relied on by the respondent as demonstrating a lower range of 
  sentence do not share the characteristic of a domestic context and therefore 
  do not reduce the range of sentence proposed by the Crown. However, the respondent 
  is correct that, in each of the cases relied on by the Crown, the victims suffered 
  serious physical injuries, and that the Crown's authorities are distinguishable 
  from this case on that basis. </p>
<p>
  [22] Nevertheless, I accept the Crown's submission that the sentence imposed 
  in this case is below what is appropriate for this offence and this offender 
  and that it is therefore unfit. I reach this conclusion for three reasons. </p>
<p>
  [23] First, while it is true that the complainant did not suffer any physical 
  injuries, in the context of an attempted murder, the absence of physical injuries 
  is a function of chance and does not necessarily justify a significant reduction 
  in the range of sentence that is otherwise appropriate. As noted by Lamer C.J. 
  in R. v. Logan, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 731, "[T]he attempted murderer is no less 
  a killer than a murderer: he may be lucky &#133; but he still has the same killer 
  instinct." The Chief Justice also remarked that, "while a conviction 
  for attempted murder does not automatically result in a life sentence, the offence 
  is punishable by life and the usual penalty is very severe". </p>
<p>
  [24] Further, where an attempted murder is committed in the context of a domestic 
  relationship, the likelihood of lasting psychological trauma to the victim arising 
  from the irrational and obsessive nature of the misconduct is significant and, 
  where present, justifies the imposition of a substantial penalty separate and 
  apart from the issue of protection. In this case, the complainant's victim impact 
  statement indicates that she has felt depressed, humiliated and vulnerable as 
  the result of the attack. She is constantly in fear for her safety and that 
  of her new partner and is afraid of leaving her home unlocked, going outside, 
  and driving at night. Following the attack she felt unable to concentrate and 
  eventually lost her fulltime job. These effects are substantial and of uncertain 
  duration.</p>
<p>
  [25] The trial judge made a clear finding that the respondent formed the specific 
  intent to kill the complainant. Although the trial judge described the respondent's 
  attempt as futile, I take his comment as referring to the actual outcome and 
  not to the potential effects of the respondent's actions. As noted by the trial 
  judge, the respondent's conduct was a "specific attempt" at killing 
  the complainant. The respondent used his vehicle as a weapon, driving it at 
  the complainant's vehicle at a high rate of speed. The resulting collision caused 
  the complainant's vehicle to spin but, fortuitously, put the respondent's vehicle 
  in the ditch and ended the incident. The complainant has suffered psychological 
  trauma as a result of these events. In the circumstances, the absence of physical 
  injuries to the complainant did not justify an almost fifty per cent reduction 
  in the lowest end of the range of sentence that is otherwise appropriate.</p>
<p>
  [26] Second, in addition to the aggravating feature of a domestic context, there 
  is an additional aggravating factor present in this case that appears to have 
  been present in some, but not all, of the authorities relied on by the Crown, 
  namely, the planned and persistent nature of the respondent's conduct. In that 
  regard, I note, in particular, the respondent's statement to his son before 
  leaving his St. Thomas home that his wife "was either going to come home 
  or she was going to go to her grave", as well as his subsequent statement 
  to his daughter-in-law that he intended to go back to the complainant's place 
  and finish the job. It is therefore clear that the respondent's actions were 
  not spontaneous and that, even with the benefit of time for after-the-fact reflection, 
  their gravity did not diminish his resolve. </p>
<p>
  [27] Third, this court has repeatedly emphasized that the principles of denunciation 
  and deterrence are of paramount importance in cases involving domestic violence: 
  see, for example, Edwards and Levo; Campbell; and Denkers. In Denkers, in particular, 
  this court indicated that the sentences imposed in cases involving domestic 
  violence must be such that they will foster an environment in which individuals 
  can feel free to leave romantic relationships without fear of harassment or 
  harm, and without fear of violence aimed at forcing a return to a no longer 
  wanted relationship: </p>
<p class="indent"> The victim, and others like her, are entitled to break off 
  romantic relationships. When they do so they are entitled to live their lives 
  normally and safely. They are entitled to live their lives free of harassment 
  by and fear of their former lovers. The law must do what it can to protect persons 
  in those circumstances. In this case its order that the appellant not have contact 
  with the victim failed to provide that protection.</p>
<p class="indent">It follows that the principles of general and specific deterrence 
  must be the overriding considerations in the determination of the sentence in 
  this case. Those principles demand a very heavy sentence to act as a general 
  deterrent to other persons who cannot abide their rejection by a person whom 
  they love. The sentence must act as a specific deterrent to this appellant who 
  was not deterred by the victim's requests that he leave her alone nor by a court 
  order requiring him to do so.</p>
<p> [28] In this case, although the trial judge alluded to the seriousness of 
  the offence, and specifically considered the importance of protecting the complainant 
  and of the respondent's rehabilitation, he gave no express consideration to 
  the sentencing principles of denunciation and deterrence. Moreover, in imposing 
  a sentence to keep control on the respondent, the trial judge did not impose 
  the maximum period of probation of three years<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a>. 
  In my view, the sentence imposed was not adequate to meet the objectives of 
  denunciation and specific and general deterrence.</p>
<p>
  [29] Taking account of the foregoing factors, as well as the authorities relied 
  on by the Crown, in my view, the appropriate sentence in this case was six years 
  imprisonment less credit for time served.</p>
<p>
  [30] Finally, I consider that the trial judge erred in concluding that the respondent 
  was more likely to receive treatment and remain subject to appropriate controls 
  if sentenced to the Provincial correctional system rather than to the Federal 
  penitentiary system without specific evidence to that effect. The trial judge 
  said that he was "concerned" that if he sentenced the respondent in 
  accordance with the Crown's submissions, the respondent would be released well 
  in advance of the completion date of the sentence "without having received 
  any treatment" and "with no strings on him, free to pursue his assaultive 
  behaviour". </p>
<p> [31] While it is true that, in imposing probation, the trial judge ordered 
  that the respondent have no contact with the complainant and that he accept 
  specific counselling, there was no evidence before the trial judge concerning 
  the relative likelihood of the respondent actually receiving counselling while 
  incarcerated or upon his release under either correctional system, nor was there 
  any evidence of what conditions might be imposed on the respondent if and when 
  he was released on parole<a href="#a">[4]</a><a name="4"></a>. </p>
<p>
  [32] Although it may be appropriate in some cases to depart from a sentencing 
  range to ensure that a convicted person will receive specific treatment that 
  has been prearranged, such a departure is not appropriate where it is unclear 
  that particular treatment will be provided and where there is no evidence concerning 
  the treatment and supervision that would be available if a sentence in the appropriate 
  range was imposed.</p>
<p>
  [33] Despite the foregoing conclusions, I would not interfere at this time with 
  the sentence that was imposed by the trial judge, other than to vary the period 
  of probation from two years to three years. Although the appeal book and transcripts 
  in this matter were filed in November 2002, the appeal was not perfected until 
  September 2003. The appellant was released from prison soon after the appeal 
  was perfected and, at the time this appeal was heard, he had been out of custody 
  for several months. On the record before us, there is no indication that the 
  appellant has made any attempt to contact the complainant, or otherwise repeat 
  his previous misconduct, since being released. This court has commented on other 
  occasions about the potentially deleterious impact of re-incarceration, particularly 
  in relation to its effect on rehabilitation: see for example, R. v. Symes (1989), 
  49 C.C.C. (3d) 81. In all of the circumstances, I do not consider that it would 
  be in the interests of justice to re-incarcerate the appellant at this time.</p>
<p>
  [34] Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal, 
  and vary the sentence imposed on the conviction for attempted murder by increasing 
  the period of probation from two years to three years, with all other terms 
  of the sentence imposed by the trial judge to remain the same.</p>
