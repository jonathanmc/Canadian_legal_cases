<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Katherine E. Swinton of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated May 1, 2002.</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  GOUDGE J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] From June 1993 to January 1994 Houshang Bouzari was abducted, imprisoned 
  and brutally tortured by agents of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Shortly after 
  his release, he escaped from Iran and eventually came to Canada as a landed 
  immigrant in 1998. He now seeks to sue Iran for the damages he suffered.</p>
<p>
  [2] Swinton J. found that his action is barred by the State Immunity Act, R.S.C. 
  1985, c. S-18 (the "SIA") and that neither the limited exceptions 
  in the SIA, nor public international law nor the Canadian Charter of Rights 
  and Freedoms could relieve against this conclusion. She therefore dismissed 
  the action. For the reasons that follow, I agree and would therefore dismiss 
  the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [3] This appeal engages two important principles: the prohibition of torture, 
  which is widely acknowledged as vital to international human rights, and the 
  requirement that sovereign states not be subjected to each other's jurisdiction, 
  which is widely acknowledged as vital to the relations between nations. The 
  balance struck today between these two principles by both Canada's domestic 
  legislation and public international law prohibits a civil claim (though not 
  a criminal prosecution) from being brought in Canada for the torture suffered 
  in Iran by Mr. Bouzari. Hence, Mr. Bouzari's civil action was properly dismissed.</p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [4] Mr. Bouzari commenced this action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice 
  on November 24, 2000. In addition to his own claim against Iran, his wife and 
  two children also claim damages pursuant to the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. F.3.</p>
<p>
  [5] Iran did not defend and was noted in default. As a result, it is deemed 
  by rule 19.02(1)(a) of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 
  194 to admit the truth of all allegations of fact made in the statement of claim.</p>
<p>
  [6] When the matter came before her on a motion to determine whether the court 
  had jurisdiction and could proceed to an assessment of damages, Swinton J. also 
  heard evidence. The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf and called Professor 
  Ed Morgan of the University of Toronto, Faculty of Law as an expert in international 
  law. The Attorney General of Canada, who had been granted leave to intervene 
  with respect to international law and Charter issues, also called expert evidence 
  on international law through Professor Christopher Greenwood of the London School 
  of Economics.</p>
<p>
  [7] The motion judge also heard submissions from Amnesty International (Canadian 
  Section) which had been given leave to intervene. In this court it continued 
  in that role and was joined by Canadian Lawyers for International Human Rights 
  ("CLAIHR") and Mr. Maher Arar, both of whom were also granted intervener 
  status.</p>
<p>
  [8] The factual record in this matter begins with Mr. Bouzari's birth in Tehran, 
  Iran on June 10, 1952. After obtaining his first university degree in Tehran, 
  he went on to complete his Ph.D. in physics at the University of Turin in Italy. 
  He returned to Iran shortly after the revolution in 1979 and soon obtained employment 
  with the government of Iran. Within a few years, he became an advisor to the 
  Minister of Petroleum and the state owned National Iranian Oil Company, where 
  he remained until late 1987. At that point, he left the Iranian government, 
  moved his family to Italy and formed his own consulting company to advise foreign 
  enterprises seeking to do oil and gas business in Iran.</p>
<p>
  [9] In the early 1990s, he was retained by a consortium of companies seeking 
  to participate in the development of the very rich South Pars oil and gas field 
  in southern Iran. In April 1992, as a result of his efforts, the consortium 
  signed a contract with the National Iranian Oil Company to provide it with oil 
  and gas exploration, offshore drilling and platform and pipeline construction 
  in connection with the South Pars project. The consortium was to receive $1.8 
  billion U.S. for its work. Mr. Bouzari's commission was to be two per cent of 
  this, to be paid over time. </p>
<p>
  [10] In November 1992, on one of his trips to Tehran to work on this project, 
  Mr. Bouzari was approached by Mehdi Hashemi Bahramani, the second son of the 
  president of Iran. He offered to give his father's help in guaranteeing the 
  implementation of the contract, but in return he demanded some $50 million. 
  Mr. Bouzari refused, but over the next few months the president's son repeated 
  this demand on a number of occasions until May 21, 1993, when Mr. Bouzari delivered 
  his final negative response.</p>
<p>
  [11] On June 1, 1993, plain clothes agents of the Iran government broke into 
  the apartment which Mr. Bouzari kept in Tehran. They held him at gunpoint, robbed 
  him of his money, jewellery, documents and electronic equipment and forcibly 
  abducted him. </p>
<p>
  [12] From then until January 22, 1994, he was imprisoned in Tehran with no due 
  process and repeatedly tortured in a variety of brutal ways. He was blindfolded, 
  beaten with fists, whipped with steel cables and subjected to electric shocks 
  to his genitals. He was deprived of food, sleep and sanitation. His head was 
  forced into a bowl of excrement and held there. He was subjected to several 
  fake executions by hanging. He was suspended by the shoulders for lengthy periods. 
  His ears were beaten until his hearing was damaged.</p>
<p>
  [13] In the summer of 1993, agents of Iran demanded a ransom of $5 million from 
  Mr. Bouzari's family, who had remained in Italy. They were able to pay only 
  $3 million of this until January 1994, when they were able to pay a further 
  $250,000. After they promised to provide the balance of the $5 million, Mr. 
  Bouzari was finally released from detention on January 22, 1994, and dumped 
  in downtown Tehran.</p>
<p>
  [14] Mr. Bouzari finally managed to flee Iran on July 27, 1994, after repeatedly 
  promising to pay the remainder of the ransom demand and saying that he could 
  not get the funds to do so unless he could get out of the country. From that 
  point until they came to Canada, Mr. Bouzari and his family lived in various 
  countries in Europe. On a number of occasions, Iranian agents contacted him 
  to demand further payments of money. These contacts were accompanied by numerous 
  threats against both Mr. Bouzari and his family. They promised to put a bullet 
  in his head in Rome and Mr. Bourzari testified that, given this threat: "you 
  can image what they could do if I go to Tehran."</p>
<p>
  [15] Mr. Bouzari says that he was kidnapped, imprisoned and tortured in order 
  to remove him from the South Pars project and to extract an advance payment 
  of the commission that he had refused to pay to the son of the president of 
  Iran. In the summer of 1993, the National Iranian Oil Company cancelled the 
  contract it had with the consortium. Iran then incorporated the Iran Offshore 
  Engineering Construction Company, appointed the president's son as its managing 
  director and caused the new company to enter into a contract with the consortium 
  for the South Pars project that was identical to the one that Mr. Bouzari had 
  obtained. Not surprisingly, he was entirely excluded from the new arrangement.</p>
<p>
  [16] Mr. Bouzari and his family emigrated to Canada in July 1998. They were 
  granted landed immigrant status, but remained citizens of Iran. When this action 
  was commenced they had applied for Canadian citizenship and as of the hearing 
  of this appeal, we were advised that this has now been granted.</p>
<p>
  [17] Mr. Bouzari continues to suffer from his experiences in Iran in a number 
  of ways including post-traumatic stress disorder, ongoing pain in his shoulders 
  and back and damaged hearing. There is no evidence of what medical care if any 
  he requires in Ontario as a result. Mr. Bouzari also testified about the effect 
  on him of being able to access the Ontario court to assert his claim, saying 
  that this would accord him a sense of relief in being able to tell his story. 
  Indeed, he said that even the opportunity to tell his story to the court in 
  the course of this jurisdictional dispute was helpful to him.</p>
<p>
  [18] Mr. Bouzari commenced this action on November 24, 2000, seeking damages 
  from Iran for kidnapping, false imprisonment, assault, torture and death threats. 
  He also seeks the return of the ransom monies paid to Iran and punitive damages. 
  His wife and children seek damages pursuant to the Family Law Act. </p>
<p>
  [19] The motion judge dismissed the action in reasons for judgment that are 
  both thorough and erudite. She first addressed the question of the court's jurisdiction 
  over a claim that is brought against a foreign defendant for a tort committed 
  abroad. While she found no real and substantial connection with Ontario, as 
  would normally be required to establish jurisdiction, she declined to decide 
  the case on that basis because of the possibility that these rules might be 
  modified where the claim is for torture by a foreign state inflicted in that 
  state.</p>
<p>
  [20] She then turned to the issue of the state immunity of Iran. She found that 
  none of the three exceptions provided in the SIA applies to displace the immunity 
  accorded by s. 3 of that legislation. She also concluded that there is no public 
  international law, sourced either in treaties or in customary international 
  law, that alters that conclusion. Finally, she found that s. 3 of the SIA does 
  not violate s. 7 of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  [21] As a result, she concluded that the court has no jurisdiction over Iran 
  in the circumstances of this case because of state immunity. She therefore dismissed 
  the action. Mr. Bouzari now appeals.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [22] While I am in substantial agreement with the reasons of Swinton J., the 
  arguments made on appeal require that I deal with each of the four issues that 
  she addressed. They are: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) The court's jurisdiction over this action pursuant to common 
  law rules of conflict of laws;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) The interpretation of the SIA;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) The impact of public international law whether found in 
  Canada's treaty obligations or in norms of customary international law; and</p>
<p class="indent">(d) The Charter issue.</p>
<p>THE CONFLICT OF LAWS ISSUE</p>
<p>
  [23] The appellant's claim is against Iran, a foreign defendant, for acts of 
  torture it committed against him in Iran, which he says continue to cause him 
  damage here. The test for determining whether the Ontario court should take 
  jurisdiction over an action like this has two parts. The plaintiff must first 
  meet the legal requirement that has come to be known as the real and substantial 
  connection test. If he does so, the court retains the discretion to decline 
  jurisdiction if there is another forum more appropriate to entertain the action. 
  This is the forum conveniens test. The factors to be considered in each of these 
  are admirably elucidated by Sharpe J.A. in Muscutt v. Courcelles (2002), 213 
  D.L.R. (4th ) 577 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [24] It is the first of these two that is in issue here. The choice of the more 
  convenient forum does not arise, since it would appear that there is no forum 
  other than Ontario capable of assuming jurisdiction. As the motion judge found, 
  the appellant cannot sue in Iran, particularly in light of the evidence that 
  he might well be killed by agents of the state if he were to return there. Nor 
  is there any suggestion of any other forum except Ontario in which the appellant 
  could bring this action. The question is simply whether Ontario has jurisdiction 
  simpliciter.</p>
<p>
  [25] In response to our request, the parties filed written submissions following 
  the hearing of the appeal to address the applicability of the real and substantial 
  connection test to this case. Both the appellant and Amnesty International submit 
  that this test should not be applied to determine whether Ontario has jurisdiction 
  over a civil action for torture abroad. The appellant says that because prohibition 
  of torture is so important as a peremptory norm of customary international law, 
  there must be universal civil jurisdiction to sue, limited only by the required 
  presence of the plaintiff in the jurisdiction at the time of the proceeding 
  and his continuing to suffer harm there due to the torture. Amnesty International 
  would not require even these two conditions, appearing to argue for a full universal 
  jurisdiction, namely, the right to sue in Ontario for torture regardless of 
  any connection to the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  [26] CLAIHR, although adopting both these submissions, also argues that the 
  real and substantial connection test is sufficient to allow Ontario to take 
  jurisdiction over the appellant's claim, particularly given the absence of another 
  forum. </p>
<p>
  [27] The Attorney General also urges the application of the real and substantial 
  connection test, but argues that an even greater connection with Ontario should 
  be required because the assumption of jurisdiction in a civil action against 
  a foreign state could affect foreign relations, comity and international order. 
  </p>
<p>
  [28] In my view, there is no basis for departing from the real and substantial 
  connection test in this kind of case. There is nothing in the SIA nor in any 
  treaty by which Canada is bound that would require Ontario to apply a rule of 
  universal jurisdiction, even modified as the appellant suggests, to a civil 
  action for torture abroad by a foreign state. Nor does there appear to be any 
  norm of customary international law to that effect. There is no general practice 
  nor wide-spread legal acknowledgement by states that civil jurisdiction is to 
  be accorded on this basis for an action based on foreign torture. There is thus 
  no reason to displace the usual common law test.</p>
<p>
  [29] While it is true, as the Attorney General argues, that the taking of jurisdiction 
  in a civil action against a foreign state raises questions of international 
  order, this is not a reason to tighten the real and substantial connection test 
  in such a circumstance. Rather, it is a consideration about whether state immunity 
  ought to be accorded to the defendant foreign state. In other words, the question 
  of whether such a consideration precludes a foreign state from being sued in 
  Ontario is one of state immunity rather than jurisdiction simiplicter. </p>
<p>
  [30] Moreover, as Sharpe J.A. emphasized in Muscutt, supra, the hallmark of 
  the real and substantial connection test is flexibility. As a result, it can 
  meet the special challenges of this kind of case. It is not meant to be rigid, 
  but rather is meant to be guided ultimately by the requirements of order and 
  fairness, not a mechanical counting of connections with the proposed forum. 
  As Sharpe J.A. said at para. 43, the question is whether Ontario can assume 
  jurisdiction over the defendant given the sort of relationship that exists among 
  the case, the parties and the forum.</p>
<p> [31] Sharpe J.A. went on to elucidate a number of factors that are relevant 
  in assessing whether a real and substantial connection exists with the Ontario 
  forum. They are as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the connection between the forum and the plaintiff's claim;</li>
  <li>the connection between the forum and the defendant;</li>
  <li>unfairness to the defendant in assuming jurisdiction; </li>
  <li>unfairness to the plaintiff in not assuming jurisdiction;</li>
  <li>involvement of other parties to the suit;</li>
  <li>the court's willingness to recognize and enforce an extra-provincial judgment 
    rendered on the same jurisdictional basis;</li>
  <li>whether the case is interprovincial or international in nature (although 
    the subsequent case of Beals v. Saldanha, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416 suggests that 
    there is little difference between these two); and</li>
  <li>comity and the standards of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement prevailing 
    elsewhere. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  [32] As the motion judge said, if this were the usual case of a foreign defendant 
  sued here for a foreign tort, the application of these factors would probably 
  yield the conclusion that there is no real and substantial connection to Ontario. 
  </p>
<p>
  [33] Of particular importance is that at the time of the torture the appellant 
  had absolutely no connection with Ontario. In this, his situation is very different 
  from that of Mr. Arar. While it is not suggested that the appellant came here 
  merely to engage the jurisdiction of the Ontario court, he did not arrive until 
  1998, more than four years after the torture finally ended. In all, the appellant's 
  connection to Ontario for the purposes of this test is very tenuous.</p>
<p>
  [34] Moreover, the defendant Iran has no connection with Ontario beyond, presumably, 
  the diplomatic. There is no suggestion that it is set up to easily defend a 
  civil action in another state.</p>
<p>
  [35] As well, there appears to be no broadly shared international practice among 
  states to assume jurisdiction over civil actions in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [36] That said, there are several circumstances that make the presumptive conclusion 
  of no jurisdiction troubling. First, the action is based on torture by a foreign 
  state, which is a violation of both international human rights and peremptory 
  norms of public international law. As the perpetrator, Iran has eliminated itself 
  as a possible forum, although it otherwise would be the most logical jurisdiction. 
  This would seem to diminish significantly the importance of any unfairness to 
  the defendant due to its lack of connection to Ontario. </p>
<p>
  [37] Second, if Ontario does not take jurisdiction, the appellant will be left 
  without a place to sue. Given that the appellant is now connected to Ontario 
  by his citizenship, the requirement of fairness that underpins the real and 
  substantial connection test would seem to be of elevated importance if the alternative 
  is that the appellant cannot bring this action anywhere. </p>
<p>
  [38] Thus, I think that the application of the real and substantial connection 
  test to the circumstances of this case is not easy. However, given the conclusion 
  I have reached on the issue of state immunity, it is unnecessary to finally 
  determine how the real and substantial connection test would apply here. That 
  is best left for a case in which the issue must be resolved.</p>
<p>THE STATE IMMUNITY ACT ISSUE</p>
<p>
  [39] The appellant brings this action against a foreign state. The action therefore 
  necessarily engages the principle of sovereign immunity or state immunity.</p>
<p>
  [40] Founded on the concepts of the sovereign equality of states and the non-interference 
  of states in the internal affairs of each other, the principle is rooted in 
  customary international law. </p>
<p>
  [41] Historically, it provided foreign states with absolute immunity from proceedings 
  in the courts of other states. However, over the years, the dictates of justice 
  have led to some attenuation in the absolute immunity of states, through the 
  evolution of certain specified exceptions to the general rule. Nevertheless, 
  the doctrine of restrictive immunity which has emerged continues to have the 
  general principle of state immunity as its foundation. In Schreiber v. Canada 
  (Attorney General) (2002), 216 D.L.R. (4th) 513 (S.C.C.) LeBel J. put it this 
  way at para. 17: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Despite the increasing number of emerging exceptions, the general principle 
  of sovereign immunity remains an important part of the international legal order, 
  except when expressly stated otherwise, and there is no evidence that an international 
  peremptory norm has been established to suggest otherwise. Indeed, Brownlie 
  [Principles of Public International Law, 5th ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998)], 
  supra, notes at pp. 332-33 that: </p>
<p class="indent"> It is far from easy to state the current legal position in 
  terms of customary or general international law. Recent writers emphasize that 
  there is a trend in the practice of states towards the restrictive doctrine 
  of immunity but avoid firm and precise prescriptions as to the present state 
  of the law. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
<p class="indent">As observed at the outset of these reasons, this principle of 
  international law has been incorporated into the Canadian domestic legal order 
  through the enactment of the federal State Immunity Act.</p>
<p>
  [42] The SIA reflects this approach. It was passed by Parliament in 1982 and 
  makes foreign states immune from civil suits in Canadian courts unless one of 
  the exceptions in the Act applies. Section 3 is its cornerstone: </p>
<p class="indent"> 3. (1) Except as provided by this Act, a foreign state is immune 
  from the jurisdiction of any court in Canada.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) In any proceedings before a court, the court shall give 
  effect to the immunity conferred on a foreign state by subsection (1) notwithstanding 
  that the state has failed to take any step in the proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [43] The appellant relies on three exceptions. The first is found in s. 18 of 
  the Act: </p>
<p class="indent">
  18. This Act does not apply to criminal proceedings or proceedings in the nature 
  of criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [44] The appellant argues that this proceeding is in the nature of a criminal 
  proceeding because he is seeking punitive damages which are in the nature of 
  a fine. The motion judge rejected this argument, concluding that this relief 
  is available only in a civil proceeding after a finding of civil liability and 
  an award of compensatory damages. She found that while the purpose of punitive 
  damages is to deter, they remain a remedy in a civil proceeding. I agree. </p>
<p>
  [45] Second, the appellant relies on the tort exception found in s. 6 of the 
  Act: </p>
<p class="indent"> 6. A foreign state is not immune from the jurisdiction of a 
  court in any proceedings that relate to</p>
<p class="indent">(a) any death or personal or bodily injury, or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) any damage to or loss of property</p>
<p class="indent">that occurs in Canada.</p>
<p>
  [46] The appellant argues that his suffering continues in Canada and that this 
  constitutes injury occurring in Canada. The motion judge rejected this argument 
  as well, finding that the appellant continues to suffer from physical and psychological 
  injuries inflicted on him not in Canada, but in Iran, because of the acts of 
  torture committed there. </p>
<p>
  [47] Again I agree. This reasoning conforms with LeBel J.'s discussion of this 
  exception in Schreiber, supra. At para. 80 he describes it as reflecting "a 
  legislative intent to create an exception to state immunity which would be restricted 
  to a class of claims arising out of a physical breach of personal integrity". 
  Viewing the exception in this light, the SIA requires that the physical breach 
  of personal integrity giving rise to the claim take place in Canada. The appellant 
  cannot meet that condition. He was tortured in Iran.</p>
<p>
  [48] The third exception cited by the appellant, and the one he relies on most 
  heavily, is that relating to commercial activity. It is found in s. 5 of the 
  Act: </p>
<p class="indent">
  5. A foreign state is not immune from the jurisdiction of a court in any proceedings 
  that relate to any commercial activity of the foreign state.</p>
<p>
  [49] The Act also contains the following definition of "commercial activity": </p>
<p class="indent">
  "commercial activity" means any particular transaction, act or conduct 
  or any regular course of conduct that by reason of its nature is of a commercial 
  character[.]</p>
<p>
  [50] The appellant argues that this exception applies because the acts of torture 
  on which his claim is based are related to the appellant's commercial activity 
  in connection with the South Pars oil and gas field. The motion judge disagreed, 
  finding that regardless of their purpose, these acts were exercises of the state 
  policing, security and imprisonment powers and therefore were inherently sovereign 
  and not commercial in nature.</p>
<p>
  [51] I agree with her conclusion that the commercial activity exception does 
  not apply here. Section 5 of the Act requires that the acts to which the proceedings 
  relate (namely the acts of torture) be commercial in nature. It is not enough 
  that the proceedings relate to acts which, in turn, relate to commercial activity 
  of the foreign state. To interpret the exception in this way, as the appellant 
  contends, would broaden the exception beyond the clear language of the SIA. 
  </p>
<p>
  [52] The issue, then, is whether the acts of torture for the which the appellant 
  sues can be said to be commercial in nature. Re Canada Labour Code, [1992] 2 
  S.C.R. 50 is the leading authority on this question. Writing for the majority 
  at 69, La Forest J. set out the two basic questions raised by s. 5: first, whether 
  the acts in question constitute commercial activity and second, whether the 
  proceedings are related to that activity.</p>
<p>
  [53] La Forest J. found that a consideration of the purpose of the acts is of 
  some, although limited, use in determining both their nature and which facets 
  of the acts in question are truly "related" to the proceedings in 
  issue. Here, apart from their purpose, the acts of torture underpinning the 
  appellant's action cannot be said to have anything to do with commerce. They 
  are nothing more than unilaterally imposed acts of brutality. The appellant 
  believes that they were committed with a purpose of affecting his involvement 
  in the commercial activity of the South Pars project. Even if this is taken 
  to include an intention to affect the commercial activity of Iran, that is not 
  enough to turn the acts of torture themselves into the commercial activity of 
  Iran. The acts of torture are related only by intention to the commercial activity 
  of the South Pars project.</p>
<p>
  [54] Moreover, the proceedings here are not truly "related" to this 
  aspect of the acts of torture. If the appellant's claim proceeds, the purpose 
  of these acts is of little if any relevance to the appellant's ability to recover 
  damages for them. Damages would flow regardless of the purpose of the acts. 
  In other words, the only aspect of the acts of torture that can be linked in 
  any way to the commercial activity of Iran is their alleged purpose. Since this 
  proceeding is not "related" to this aspect of the acts in question, 
  it cannot be said that these acts relate to any commercial activity of Iran 
  for the purposes of s. 5 of the SIA.</p>
<p>
  [55] Hence, I conclude that the commercial activity exception in s. 5 of the 
  Act has no application to this case.</p>
<p>
  [56] The final argument related to the SIA issue is raised by the intervener 
  CLAIHR. It argues that the enactment of the SIA has not displaced the common 
  law of state immunity and that, under that common law, torture cannot be legitimized 
  as a government act and cannot therefore attract immunity.</p>
<p>
  [57] In my view, the wording of the SIA must be taken as a complete answer to 
  this argument. Section 3(1) could not be clearer. To reiterate, it says: </p>
<p class="indent">
  3. (1) Except as provided by this Act, a foreign state is immune from the jurisdiction 
  of any court in Canada [Emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [58] The plain and ordinary meaning of these words is that they codify the law 
  of sovereign immunity. Indeed in Re Canada Labour Code, supra, La Forest J. 
  says exactly that at 69: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This appeal raises the issue of sovereign immunity, as codified in the State 
  Immunity Act [Emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [59] Thus the appellant is left with the exceptions in the Act, and, as I have 
  indicated, none of the three he advances applies to this case.</p>
<p>
  THE PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW ISSUE</p>
<p>
  a) Introduction</p>
<p>
  [60] This issue takes the appellant beyond the exceptions to state immunity 
  which are expressly enacted in the SIA. He argues that the SIA must be read 
  in conformity with Canada's public international law obligations and that both 
  by treaty and by peremptory norms of customary international law, Canada is 
  bound to permit a civil remedy against a foreign state for torture committed 
  abroad. He says that Canada's obligations under international law require that 
  the SIA be interpreted to provide an exception to state immunity for such a 
  claim.</p>
<p>
  [61] The motion judge dismissed this argument. She carefully analyzed both Canada's 
  treaty obligations and its obligations under customary public international 
  law and found that neither extends to the obligation contended for by the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [62] I agree with her analysis and will return to it in more detail. First, 
  however, it is useful to turn to a preliminary point about the interplay between 
  Canada's obligations at public international law and its domestic legislation.</p>
<p>
  [63] Canada's international law obligations can arise as a matter of conventional 
  international law or customary international law. </p>
<p>
  [64] Where Canada has undertaken treaty obligations, it is bound by them as 
  a matter of conventional international law. Parliament is then presumed to legislate 
  consistently with those obligations. See Schreiber, supra, at para. 50. Thus, 
  so far as possible, courts should interpret domestic legislation consistently 
  with these treaty obligations. </p>
<p>
  [65] The same is true where Canada's obligations arise as a matter of customary 
  international law. As acknowledged by the Attorney General in this case, customary 
  rules of international law are directly incorporated into Canadian domestic 
  law unless explicitly ousted by contrary legislation. So far as possible, domestic 
  legislation should be interpreted consistently with those obligations. This 
  is even more so where the obligation is a peremptory norm of customary international 
  law, or jus cogens. For a helpful discussion of these and related issues see 
  Jutta Brunn&eacute;e and Stephen J. Toope: A Hesitant Embrace: The Application 
  of International Law by Canadian Courts (2002) 40 Canadian Journal of International 
  Law 3. </p>
<p>
  [66] However, as Professors Brunn&eacute;e and Toope have written, whether Canada's 
  obligations arise pursuant to treaty or to customary international law, it is 
  open to Canada to legislate contrary to them. Such legislation would determine 
  Canada's domestic law although it would put Canada in breach of its international 
  obligations.</p>
<p>
  [67] This discussion is important in this case because the SIA so clearly provides 
  the code for according state immunity as a matter of Canadian domestic law. 
  Even if Canada's international law obligations required that Canada permit a 
  civil remedy for torture abroad by a foreign state, Canada has legislated in 
  a way that does not do so. Section 3 of the SIA accords complete state immunity 
  except as provided by the SIA. And, as we have seen, none of the relevant exceptions 
  in the SIA permits a civil claim against a foreign state for torture committed 
  abroad. Canada has clearly legislated so as not to create this exception to 
  state immunity whether it has an international law obligation to do so or not. 
  </p>
<p>
  [68] However, the more fundamental question is whether Canada has the international 
  law obligation contended for by the appellant. After careful examination, the 
  motion judge concluded that it does not. She analysed this first as a matter 
  of treaty law and then of customary international law. In both contexts she 
  relied on the expert evidence of Professor Greenwood concerning the scope of 
  Canada's international law obligations. She preferred this evidence to that 
  of Professor Morgan because she found Professor Greenwood to be more helpful 
  on the issue she had to decide, namely, the current state of international law. 
  Professor Morgan, on the other hand, focused rather more on where, in his view, 
  international law is headed. While the motion judge's acceptance of Professor 
  Greenwood's opinion over that of Professor Morgan is not a finding of fact by 
  a trial judge, it is a finding based on the evidence she heard and is therefore 
  owed a certain deference in this court. I would depart from it only if there 
  were good reason to do so and, having examined the transcript, I can find none. 
  Indeed, for the reason she gave, I agree with her reliance on Professor Greenwood's 
  evidence. </p>
<p>
  b) Canada's treaty obligations</p>
<p>
  [69] The appellant's argument that Canada has a treaty obligation to provide 
  an exception to state immunity for civil actions for torture committed abroad 
  by a foreign state is based primarily on the Convention Against Torture and 
  Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 10 December 1984, 
  1465 U.N.T.S. 85, Can. T.S. 1987 No. 36 which came into force on June 26, 1987. 
  Canada has ratified this Convention although Iran has not. </p>
<p>
  [70] The definition of torture in Article 1 of the Convention requires that 
  the acts of torture be perpetrated by or with the consent or acquiescence of 
  public officials or persons acting in a public capacity. </p>
<p>
  [71] Article 4 affects Canada's criminal law jurisdiction. It imposes on each 
  ratifying state the obligation to ensure that all acts of torture are offences 
  under its criminal law. States have implemented this obligation by allowing 
  prosecution of individuals for acts of torture, whether committed in Canada 
  or abroad. Canada has done so through An Act to Amend the Criminal Code (torture) 
  R.S.C. 1985, c.10 (3rd Supp.) s. 2.</p>
<p>
  [72] However, it is Article 14 which is the focus of the appellant's argument. 
  It reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Each State Party shall ensure in its legal system that the 
  victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to 
  fair and adequate compensation including the means for as full rehabilitation 
  as possible. In the event of the death of the victim as a result of an act of 
  torture, his dependants shall be entitled to compensation.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Nothing in this article shall affect any right of the victim 
  or other person to compensation which may exist under national law.</p>
<p>
  [73] The question is whether this Article creates an obligation on a ratifying 
  state to provide a civil right of redress for torture whether committed at home 
  or abroad or only for torture committed within its own jurisdiction. </p>
<p>
  [74] The motion judge concluded that the Convention creates no obligation on 
  Canada to provide access to the courts so that a litigant can pursue an action 
  for damages against a foreign state for torture committed outside Canada. Rather, 
  it simply requires Canada to provide a civil remedy for torture committed within 
  its jurisdiction. The motion judge rested this conclusion on several foundations, 
  each of which the appellant challenges.</p>
<p>
  [75] First, she accepted Professor Greenwood's opinion to this effect. The appellant 
  says that she should have preferred the opinion of Professor Morgan. I disagree. 
  As I have said, she properly accepted expert evidence that focused on the present 
  state of international law, rather than its possible or even hoped for future. 
  </p>
<p>
  [76] The motion judge went on to analyze the text of the Convention and found 
  it to provide no clear guidance on the issue. While some of its articles contain 
  a specific territorial limitation, other articles (such as Articles 10 and 15) 
  contain no explicit language to that effect, exactly like Article 14, even though 
  they clearly only apply within the territorial jurisdiction of the signator 
  state. The appellant says that this conclusion represents error and that the 
  ordinary meaning of Article 14 is that it applies no matter where the torture 
  takes place. I disagree. A full textual analysis of the provisions of the Convention 
  shows that the absence of explicit territorial language does not necessarily 
  mean the absence of territorial limitation. The text of the Convention itself 
  simply provides no answer to the question.</p>
<p>
  [77] Finally, the motion judge looked to state practice concerning Article 14. 
  Article 31(3)(b) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 23 May 1969, 
  1155 U.N.T.S. 331, Can. T.S. 1980 No. 37 provides that where subsequent practice 
  in the application of a treaty establishes agreement regarding its interpretation, 
  this should be taken into account in giving the treaty meaning.</p>
<p>
  [78] Both experts agreed that state practice is important in the interpretation 
  of Article 14. The motion judge found that no state interprets Article 14 to 
  require it to take civil jurisdiction over a foreign state for acts committed 
  outside the forum state. Indeed, on ratifying the Convention, the United States 
  issued an interpretive declaration indicating that it understood Article 14 
  to require a state to provide a private right of action for damages only for 
  acts of torture committed within the jurisdiction of that state. Ultimately, 
  the motion judge based her conclusion on Professor Greenwood's evidence of a 
  broad state practice reflecting a shared understanding that Article 14 limits 
  the obligation of a ratifying state to providing the right to a civil remedy 
  only for acts of torture committed within its territory.</p>
<p>
  [79] While the appellant contests this finding of state practice, particularly 
  that it reaches the level of agreement on the meaning of Article 14, there was 
  ample evidence to sustain this conclusion. Indeed, I agree with it.</p>
<p>
  [80] The appellant also argues that the motion judge should have expressly considered 
  the fact that an early draft of Article 14 contained the phrase "committed 
  in any territory under its jurisdiction" and should have drawn the inference 
  that by omitting this phrase from the final draft, the intention was to exclude 
  this concept from the Article. However, Professor Greenwood, whose opinion the 
  motion judge accepted, was of the view that the words were dropped because they 
  were superfluous since this limitation was already implicit in the Article. 
  The motion judge did not err in accepting this opinion and disregarding the 
  drafting history of Article 14.</p>
<p>
  [81] In my view, the motion judge correctly concluded on the basis of these 
  various considerations that Canada's treaty obligation pursuant to Article 14 
  does not extend to providing the right to a civil remedy against a foreign state 
  for torture committed abroad. The appellant's various attacks on her careful 
  analysis all must be dismissed. Canada's treaty obligation under Article 14 
  simply does not extend to the appellant's case.</p>
<p>
  [82] In saying that Canada is obliged by treaty to extend a civil remedy for 
  torture to him, the appellant also placed some reliance on Article 14(1) of 
  the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 16 December 1966, 
  999 U.N.T.S. 171, Can. T.S. 1976 No. 47 by which both Canada and Iran have agreed 
  to be bound. It reads in part: </p>
<p class="indent"> Article 14</p>
<p class="indent">1. All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. 
  In the determination of any criminal charge against him, or of his rights and 
  obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public 
  hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. 
  &#133;</p>
<p>
  [83] The simple answer to the appellant's position is that the motion judge 
  accepted Professor Greenwood's evidence that Article 14 of this Covenant has 
  not been interpreted to date to require a state to provide access to its courts 
  for sovereign acts committed outside its jurisdiction and his opinion that this 
  provision carries no such obligation. This finding of the motion judge is due 
  deference in this court. Indeed, in my view, it is the right conclusion.</p>
<p> c) Canada's obligations under customary international law</p>
<p>
  [84] The appellant also argues that Canada is bound by peremptory norms of customary 
  international law to permit a civil claim against a foreign state for torture 
  committed abroad.</p>
<p>
  [85] As Professor Greenwood put it, customary international law is generally 
  defined as widespread and consistent state practice accepted as law. The immunity 
  of states from civil proceedings in the courts of foreign jurisdictions is an 
  example of a principle of customary international law. The enactment of the 
  SIA confirms that state immunity is a part of Canada's domestic law.</p>
<p>
  [86] A peremptory norm of customary international law or rule of jus cogens 
  is a higher form of customary law. It is one accepted and recognized by the 
  international community of states as a norm from which no derogation is permitted. 
  Not only does the rule of jus cogens override other rules of customary international 
  law in conflict with it, but, by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 
  a treaty obligation which conflicts with a rule of jus cogens is of no force 
  or effect in international law.</p>
<p>
  [87] The motion judge found that prohibition of torture is a rule of jus cogens. 
  For the purpose of this appeal, no one, including the Attorney General of Canada, 
  questions this conclusion. Rather the question is the scope of that norm. In 
  particular, does it extend to a requirement to provide the right to a civil 
  remedy for torture committed abroad by a foreign state?</p>
<p>
  [88] The motion judge conducted a careful review of the decisions of domestic 
  and international tribunals and state immunity legislation and concluded that 
  the peremptory norm prohibiting torture does not carry with it such an obligation. 
  She put her conclusion succinctly at para. 63 of her reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  An examination of the decisions of national courts and international tribunals, 
  as well as state legislation with respect to sovereign immunity, indicates that 
  there is no principle of customary international law which provides an exception 
  from state immunity where an act of torture has been committed outside the forum, 
  even for acts contrary to jus cogens. Indeed, the evidence of state practice, 
  as reflected in these and other sources, leads to the conclusion that there 
  is an ongoing rule of customary international law providing state immunity for 
  acts of torture committed outside the forum state.</p>
<p>
  [89] The appellant attacks this conclusion primarily on two bases. First, he 
  says that if the prohibition against torture is to be respected, torture cannot 
  be considered a state function and therefore cannot be accorded state immunity. 
  In this he relies on R. v. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex 
  parte Pinochet (No. 3), [2000] 1 A.C. 147. </p>
<p>
  [90] I do not agree. As I have discussed, the SIA simply does not include a 
  civil action for damages for torture in any of the specifically drawn exceptions 
  to the encompassing state immunity provided in s. 3(1). Moreover, the extent 
  of the prohibition against torture as a rule of jus cogens is determined not 
  by any particular view of what is required if it is to be meaningful, but rather 
  by the widespread and consistent practice of states. As the motion judge found, 
  that practice reflects the customary international law principle that state 
  immunity is provided for acts of torture committed outside the forum state, 
  not the obligation contended for by the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [91] Finally, nothing in Pinochet is inconsistent with this. As the motion judge 
  points out, Pinochet concerned criminal proceedings against an individual, not 
  civil proceedings against the state of Chile. It is in that context that one 
  of the law lords, Lord Browne-Wilkinson (at 203) offered the view that the commission 
  by an individual of the international crime of torture cannot be considered 
  to be an act done in an official capacity on behalf of the state and therefore 
  is not a state function. However, three of the law lords: Lord Hutton (at 254 
  and 264), Lord Millett (at 278) and Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers (at 280) 
  expressly discussed the immunity of the state from civil proceedings for torture 
  committed in that state and all accepted that it would apply. Thus, the opinions 
  in Pinochet clearly reflect the distinction for state immunity purposes between 
  proceedings seeking a criminal sanction against an individual for acts of torture 
  committed abroad and proceedings seeking a civil remedy against a foreign state 
  for the same acts. In the former case, the sanction can be imposed on the individual 
  without subjecting one state to the jurisdiction of another. That is not so 
  in the latter case. </p>
<p>
  [92] This distinction is relevant for the appellant's second point. The appellant 
  argues that the prohibition against torture constitutes a right to be free from 
  torture and where there is a right there must be a remedy. </p>
<p>
  [93] There are two answers to this. The first reflects the distinction drawn 
  in Pinochet. As a matter of principle, providing a civil remedy for breach of 
  the prohibition of torture is not the only way to give effect to that prohibition. 
  The criminal prosecution of individual torturers who commit their acts abroad 
  (which is expressly sanctioned by the Convention Against Torture) gives some 
  effect to the prohibition without damaging the principle of state sovereignty 
  on which relations between nations are based.</p>
<p>
  [94] The second answer is that as a matter of practice, states do not accord 
  a civil remedy for torture committed abroad by foreign states. The peremptory 
  norm of prohibition against torture does not encompass the civil remedy contended 
  for by the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [95] Thus, I see no basis to depart from the conclusion of the motion judge. 
  Just as Canada's treaty obligations do not do so, the rules of customary international 
  law binding Canada do not accord to the appellant the civil remedy he seeks. 
  Both under customary international law and international treaty there is today 
  a balance struck between the condemnation of torture as an international crime 
  against humanity and the principle that states must treat each other as equals 
  not to be subjected to each other's jurisdiction. It would be inconsistent with 
  this balance to provide a civil remedy against a foreign state for torture committed 
  abroad. In the future, perhaps as the international human rights movement gathers 
  greater force, this balance may change, either through the domestic legislation 
  of states or by international treaty. However, this is not a change to be effected 
  by a domestic court adding an exception to the SIA that is not there, or seeing 
  a widespread state practice that does not exist today.</p>
<p>
  THE CHARTER ISSUE</p>
<p>
  [96] The appellant's last argument is that, in any event, s. 3 of the SIA is 
  contrary to s. 7 of the Charter, insofar as it grants a state immunity from 
  liability for torture committed abroad. Section 7 reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right 
  not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental 
  justice.</p>
<p>
  [97] The motion judge found that s. 3 of the SIA causes no denial of the appellant's 
  right to security of the person and in any event, does not contravene the principles 
  of fundamental justice, because state immunity legislation is not contrary to 
  the fundamental tenents of our legal system. </p>
<p>
  [98] The appellant contests both conclusions. He says that the torture inflicted 
  upon him in Iran was a deprivation of his security of the person and that the 
  only issue is whether granting immunity to Iran from a civil claim for compensation 
  for that torture accords with fundamental justice. He relies particularly on 
  Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] 1 S.C.R. 
  3 in advancing this argument. </p>
<p>
  [99] In my view, this misreads the Supreme Court jurisprudence on this issue 
  and Suresh in particular. In the United States of America v. Burns, [2001] 1 
  S.C.R. 283, the Supreme Court made clear that while s. 7 of the Charter extends 
  to circumstances where the deprivation of life, liberty or security of the person 
  is ultimately effected by actors other than a Canadian state actor, that is 
  so only where there is a sufficient causal connection between the participation 
  of the Canadian state actor and the deprivation ultimately carried out. Where 
  there is that sufficient causal connection, the Canadian state actor is bound 
  to observe the principles of fundamental justice in participating in that deprivation.</p>
<p>
  [100] In Suresh, it was conceded that the Canadian government's action in deporting 
  an individual to torture was sufficiently causally connected to the deprivation 
  of security of the person that would result that the only question was whether 
  the deportation was in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. 
  However, the Supreme Court reiterated the principle it had stated in Burns, 
  that a sufficient causal connection between the role of the Canadian state actor 
  and the deprivation is required for s. 7 to be engaged. Only once that is established 
  is there an examination of whether the deprivation is in accordance with the 
  principles of fundamental justice. The Supreme Court put the point this way 
  at para. 54 of Suresh: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Rather, the governing principle was a general one - namely, that the guarantee 
  of fundamental justice applies even to deprivations of life, liberty or security 
  effected by actors other than our government, if there is a sufficient causal 
  connection between our government's participation and the deprivation ultimately 
  effected. We reaffirm that principle here. At least where Canada's participation 
  is a necessary precondition for the deprivation and where the deprivation is 
  an entirely foreseeable consequence of Canada's participation, the government 
  does not avoid the guarantee of fundamental justice merely because the deprivation 
  in question would be effected by someone else's hand.</p>
<p>
  [101] In the appellant's case the Canadian government had no participation whatsoever 
  in his abduction, confinement and torture in Iran. That all took place years 
  before the appellant had any connection to Canada. Nor is there any basis to 
  say that the fact that Canada enacted the SIA granting state immunity from a 
  civil claim for torture is causally connected in any way to the torture inflicted 
  on the appellant by Iran. </p>
<p>
  [102] Moreover, on this record it cannot be said that the precluding of the 
  appellant's civil claim for torture has itself caused him the kind of harm necessary 
  to trigger s. 7. There is no doubt that the denial of a civil remedy may cause 
  varying degrees of psychological harm to victims of torture, depending on the 
  individual. While the appellant has suffered horribly as a consequence of being 
  tortured, he gave very limited evidence of the impact on him of being unable 
  to claim a civil remedy against Iran. He simply said that he would feel a sense 
  of relief if the court heard his story. As discussed in Blencoe v. British Columbia 
  (Human Rights Commission), [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307, this does not reach the level 
  of serious psychological distress necessary to constitute deprivation of security 
  of the person.</p>
<p>
  [103] Thus, I agree with the motions judge that the appellant has not established 
  that s. 3 of the SIA gives rise to the necessary deprivation of security of 
  the person to engage s. 7 of the Charter. This is sufficient to dismiss the 
  appellant's claim for relief based on the Charter. Were it necessary to go beyond 
  this to determine whether s. 3 of the SIA accords with the principles of fundamental 
  justice, my conclusion would be the same as that reached by the motion judge, 
  for the reasons she gave. I do not think that s. 3 violates those principles 
  in granting state immunity to Iran from a civil claim for the torture committed 
  there. </p>
<p>
  [104] In summary therefore, I have found it unnecessary to decide whether under 
  conflict of laws principles this court can take jurisdiction over the appellant's 
  action. I have concluded that his action is barred by the SIA and that there 
  is no principle of public international law that says otherwise. Finally, I 
  have found that s. 3 of the SIA does not violate s. 7 of the Charter of Rights 
  and Freedoms. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [105] No party is seeking costs in this court. Given the nature of the issues, 
  and their importance, it is appropriate that there be no order of costs and 
  I would make none.</p>
