<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Counsel's careful, if not, microscopic deconstruction of the trial judge's 
  reasonable doubt instruction does not cause us to have any concerns that the 
  jury may have applied the wrong standard of proof. </p>
<p>
  [2] We propose to comment briefly on three of the arguments made by counsel. 
  Counsel argues that the jury was not instructed that the absence of evidence 
  could leave a reasonable doubt. The trial judge said the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A reasonable doubt is a doubt that is based on reason and common sense. It is 
  a doubt that arises from your consideration of the evidence that you have. </p>
<p>
  [3] In our view, the jury would clearly have understood that "a consideration 
  of the evidence you have" includes and requires a consideration of all 
  of the evidence and a comparison of the evidence of the various witnesses. The 
  jury were clearly told to consider that only one of the two police officers 
  at the scene observed the appellant in possession of the narcotics.</p>
<p>
  [4] A second argument raised by counsel relates to the second prong of the "W.D." 
  instruction. The trial judge said the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Naturally if you believe him you are going to acquit him. If you do not know 
  whether to believe him or not, if you are in a state of doubt, again you must 
  acquit him.</p>
<p>
  [5] In our view, these words captured the substance and essence of the first 
  and second part of the "W.D". instruction. </p>
<p>
  [6] A third argument arises from the trial judge's following instruction: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Even if you decide "while his evidence is unreliable and I am not prepared 
  to believe any of it or rely on any of it" you still must be satisfied 
  on the evidence that you do believe that he has been proved guilty beyond a 
  reasonable doubt because a person can sometimes be a liar without being guilty 
  of the offence with which they are charged.</p>
<p>
  [7] This instruction inured to the benefit of the appellant. In the course of 
  his evidence, the appellant admitted that he had lied to the police. The trial 
  judge was simply cautioning the jury against jumping from the fact that the 
  appellant had lied to the conclusion that he must have committed the offence.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appeal is dismissed. </p>
