<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants/defendants moved for judgment under Rule 21 on the basis 
  that:</p>
<p class="indent"> The Court has no jurisdiction since the Plaintiff&#8217;s claim 
  arises under the collective agreement and is in essence a claim for constructive 
  dismissal or bad faith treatment of the Plaintiff or relates to the subject 
  matter of the health or safety of the Plaintiff.</p>
<p>
  [2] The motion judge summarized the appellants&#8217; argument in these terms:</p>
<p class="indent"> The Defendants, relying on the Statement of Claim, submit that 
  it discloses no cause of action. They argue that since the facts outlined in 
  the Statement of Claim disclose that the essential character of the main of 
  action arises from the Collective Bargaining Agreement, then the remedy against 
  Falconbridge must be pursued through the grievance procedure outlined in that 
  Agreement.</p>
<p>
  [3] In dismissing the motion, the trial judge said:</p>
<p class="indent"> It is clear from the allegations in the Statement of Claim 
  that this term of the Return to Work Agreement has been breached by the Union 
  and its members. Likewise, the Defendants are alleged to have breached the Collateral 
  Agreement. It would be open to the trial Judge to find that this breach is a 
  separate cause of action not covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement. 
  This, in my opinion, raises a triable issue against all the Defendants and thus, 
  the Motion, pursuant to Rule 21(3) fails [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [4] The formal order simply dismisses the defendants&#8217; motion.</p>
<p>
  [5] Prior to the argument of the appeal, the court raised the question of its 
  jurisdiction. The issue as to whether the order made was final or interlocutory 
  was addressed by counsel prior to argument of the merits. We have concluded 
  that the appeal is interlocutory. We do not reach the merits.</p>
<p>
  [6] It is common ground that the motion judge declined to decide whether a breach 
  of the collateral agreement is covered by the collective agreement but instead 
  left that issue to the trial judge. He did not make a final decision on that 
  issue.</p>
<p>
  [7] Mr. Kennedy forcefully argued, however, that the order was final in that 
  the question of who should decide whether the allegations were arbitrable under 
  the collective agreement had been decided against him by the motion judge. Mr. 
  Kennedy submitted that the order of the motion judge foreclosed an argument 
  before the trial judge that an arbitrator and not the trial judge should decide 
  whether the allegations were arbitrable and, therefore, not actionable in the 
  Superior Court.</p>
<p>
  [8] If Mr. Kennedy&#8217;s interpretation of the decision of the motion judge 
  was correct, we would agree with him that this is a final order as defined in 
  the jurisprudence from this court. We cannot, however, agree with his interpretation. 
  </p>
<p>
  [9] It is not clear whether the question of who should decide whether the claims 
  were arbitrable was raised as a distinct issue before the motion judge. It would 
  appear that he was asked to rule that the merits of the claims had to be decided 
  by an arbitrator under the collective agreement. In any event, the decision 
  of the motion judge in no way forecloses argument before the trial judge that 
  an arbitrator and not a trial judge must decide whether these claims are arbitrable. 
  Counsel for the respondents has agreed in this court that the appellants may 
  raise this issue at trial, and that nothing said by the motion judge should 
  be taken as having decided whether an arbitrator and not the trial judge should 
  decide whether the claims are arbitrable. </p>
<p>
  [10] We are satisfied that the decision is therefore interlocutory, and that 
  we therefore have no jurisdiction and the appeal must be quashed.</p>
<p>
  [11] No costs.</p>
