<p>FELDMAN J.A.:</p>
<p>Procedural History</p>
<p>
  [1] This is a motion for an extension of time to file a Notice of Appeal. The 
  appeal is from an arbitration award dated November 13, 2001, which was incorporated 
  into a judgment of the Superior Court for the purposes of enforcement on June 
  10, 2003, pursuant to s. 50 of the Arbitration Act, S.O. 1991, c. 17. The Notice 
  of Appeal was served on July 9, 2003, but was filed a few days beyond the thirty-day 
  appeal period due to an administrative error in the office of counsel for the 
  husband, not Mr. Melamed. Mr. Melamed represents the insurers for the husband's 
  counsel as a result of this error. The wife opposes the motion not because of 
  this error, but instead because of the delay by the husband, since the arbitration 
  award was released, in bringing on an appeal.</p>
<p>
  [2] The husband has at various times been unrepresented in this matter. Although 
  the agreement to arbitrate states that the arbitration award is a final award 
  and that an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal on a question of law, the husband 
  took the position that the Arbitration Act required an appeal to the Superior 
  Court of Justice and served a Notice of Appeal to that court on December 13, 
  2001. Although he was advised by Ms. Rosen, counsel for the wife, that his appeal 
  was to the wrong court, he refused to proceed with an appeal to this court, 
  nor did he take any steps to perfect the appeal in the Superior Court. Rather, 
  he continued to write to the arbitrator asking her to amend her award (s. 44(1)(b) 
  of the Arbitration Act allows an arbitrator to amend the award at a party's 
  request where the request is made within thirty days after receiving the award), 
  which she did not do. </p>
<p>
  [3] In December 2002, the wife brought a motion in the Superior Court to enforce 
  the award and to dismiss the appeal in the Superior Court for delay and because 
  it was made to the wrong court. The portion of the motion dealing with dismissal 
  of the appeal was adjourned to allow the husband to retain counsel. It was heard 
  on April 23, 2003. An order quashing the appeal was made by Weekes J. on May 
  6, 2003 on the basis that the appeal was brought in the wrong court. The motion 
  judge did not address the delay issue. No appeal was taken from that order, 
  although in his affidavit filed in a responding motion record, the husband indicates 
  that if leave to appeal is granted, he would be seeking to combine his appeal 
  of the arbitration award with an appeal of the order of Weekes J., in effect 
  saying that the appeal itself is in the wrong court.</p>
<p>
  [4] Neither side took steps to have the arbitration award incorporated into 
  a judgment of the Superior Court until January 2003. Both sides had input into 
  the drafting of the order. It was filed as a basket (over the counter) motion 
  in March pursuant to an endorsement of Wildman J. Because of administrative 
  difficulties, the order was not signed by Scott J. until June 10, 2003. The 
  husband took no further steps to appeal the arbitration award until July 2003, 
  taking the position that the thirty-day appeal period did not begin to run until 
  June 10.</p>
<p>
  [5] It is clear that what the husband is purporting to appeal are the merits 
  of the decision of the arbitrator. The husband has raised a number of grounds 
  of appeal from the arbitration award. Mr. Melamed could not say which ones would 
  actually be pursued if an extension were to be granted. The only ground that 
  appears to raise an arguable issue of law is the ground relating to the need 
  for the arbitrator to have had up to date financial records from both sides 
  in order to make an order under the Child Support Guidelines, O. Reg. 391/97, 
  that complies with the requirements of that legislation. Ms. Rosen responds 
  that the arbitration agreement provided for each party to require whatever disclosure 
  it wanted from the other and that that was done. However, even if the appellant 
  is correct, to the extent that the records of the wife's income for a half-year 
  period were not before the arbitrator, the amount in issue is no more than $2,500. 
  i.e. a de minimus amount in the context of the cost of an appeal. The husband's 
  original counsel suggests in his affidavit that the amount may be $10,000 to 
  $15,000.</p>
<p>
  [6] The other grounds of appeal are matters that are either questions of fact, 
  or issues where the arbitrator thoroughly discussed the facts and the law and 
  came to decisions which do not appear to be based on any error of law. </p>
<p>
  Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal</p>
<p>
  [7] After taking the matter under reserve, I sought further submissions from 
  the parties on the issue of the jurisdiction of this court to hear an appeal 
  of the arbitration award. Although the agreement to arbitrate contains an appeal 
  clause that purports to allow an appeal on questions of law directly to the 
  Court of Appeal, the Arbitration Act provides a scheme for appeals of arbitration 
  awards. Section 45(2) states that if the agreement so provides, a party may 
  appeal an award to the court, defined as the Superior Court, on a question of 
  law. Otherwise, under s. 45(1) an appeal lies only to the Superior Court with 
  leave on a question of law. By s. 49, there is a further appeal to the Court 
  of Appeal with leave on questions of law. The fact that the arbitration award 
  was incorporated into a judgment does not change the appeal jurisdiction. Section 
  50 of the Act allows a party entitled to enforcement of an award to apply to 
  the court to issue a judgment for that purpose. That is the judgment of Scott 
  J., issued on June 10, 2003 in this case.</p>
<p>
  [8] One of the conditions precedent for making such an order is that no appeal 
  from the arbitration award be outstanding. To the extent that there is any appeal 
  from the judgment of Scott J., such an appeal could raise only the jurisdictional 
  propriety of making such an order, arising out of the conditions precedent set 
  out in s. 50 of the Act. Such an appeal cannot collaterally challenge the merits 
  of the underlying arbitration award. Section 50 does not create a jurisdiction 
  in the Court of Appeal to entertain an appeal of the merits of the arbitration 
  award in the guise of an appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court. To do 
  so would be inconsistent with the clear provisions of ss. 45 to 49 of the Act.	
  </p>
<p>
  [9] As the Court of Appeal is a statutory court, its jurisdiction is defined 
  by statute and cannot be conferred by parties to litigation. See R. v. Church 
  of Scientology of Toronto (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 149 (Ont. C.A.) at 150-51; 
  R. v. Bernardo (1994), 121 D.L.R. (4th) 42 at 44; R. v. Vaillancourt (1989), 
  33 O.A.C. 234; R. v. H. (E.F.) (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 202 (C.A.) at 208-209; R. 
  v. Metro News Ltd. (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 492 (Ont. C.A.) at 495; R. v. Jones 
  and Francis (1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 351 (Ont. C.A.) at 352; Kilpatrick v. Peterborough 
  Civic Hospital (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.); Rothgiesser v. Rothgiesser, 
  46 O.R. (3d) 577 (C.A.) at para. 19. It is clear from the provisions of the 
  Arbitration Act that I have referred to, that this court has no original jurisdiction 
  to hear an appeal of an arbitration award. Therefore, even had the husband's 
  Notice of Appeal been filed within thirty days of June 10, 2003, this court 
  would not have proceeded to hear the appeal from the arbitration award. Consequently, 
  the only extension of time that this court could grant relevant to an appeal 
  of the arbitration award would be an extension of the time to appeal the order 
  of Weekes J. of May 6, 2003.</p>
<p>
  The Test for Granting an Extension</p>
<p>
  [10] The test for granting an extension is set out in Frey v. MacDonald (1989), 
  33 C.P.C. (2d) 13 (Ont. C.A.): the appellant must have maintained a firm intention 
  to appeal from the beginning, the failure to observe the time limits must be 
  reasonably explained, subject to a broader rule that leave will be granted if 
  the justice of the case requires it, including the merits of the proposed appeal 
  and the prejudice to the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [11] Although the husband indicated an apparent intention to appeal by serving 
  his notice in December 2001, he took no steps to perfect in the Superior Court. 
  </p>
<p>
  [12] The husband's explanation for why he did not proceed with an appeal in 
  accordance with the time limits provided by the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 
  1990, Reg. 194, in the Superior Court after serving his Notice of Appeal is 
  that he was seeking on an ongoing basis to have the arbitrator amend her report, 
  and as well, that he was unrepresented. The husband was clearly unhappy with 
  the arbitrator's decision and wanted it changed, but he did not attempt to comply 
  with the Rules to move forward with an appeal. I note that he did not pay the 
  amounts awarded including child support until May 2003.</p>
<p>
  [13] Once he obtained a lawyer in the spring of 2003, he defended the motion 
  brought by the wife to dismiss for delay or because he was in the wrong court. 
  He then waited for the order incorporating the award before proceeding to file 
  a Notice of Appeal to this court, although he did pay the arrears. </p>
<p>
  [14] An appeal is limited to an appeal on a question of law. As indicated above, 
  there is only one issue that appears to be wholly a question of law, and to 
  raise it, the appellant will have to show the deficiencies in disclosure by 
  the wife, and meet the argument that by the terms of the arbitration agreement 
  the husband could have required more disclosure.</p>
<p>
  [15] The next factor is the issue of prejudice to the wife. She has incurred 
  considerable cost during the delay in this matter as her counsel has had to 
  be proactive to have the arbitration and enforcement of the award proceed. She 
  deposes a need for finality for her emotional well-being. </p>
<p>
  [16] The unusual added feature of this case is the procedural confusion surrounding 
  the rights of appeal of the arbitration award, caused by the original agreement 
  that the parties made, and the ongoing misunderstanding of the legal route of 
  appeal.</p>
<p>
  [17] In all the circumstances, I believe an extension of time should be granted 
  to the husband to appeal the order of Weekes J. In order to expedite matters, 
  once the Notice of Appeal has been filed, the parties may prepare a consent 
  order, setting aside the order of Weekes J. that had quashed the appeal in the 
  Superior Court. If so advised, the wife may proceed with her previously filed 
  motion to dismiss the appeal for delay. Otherwise, the husband may proceed to 
  appeal in accordance with the Arbitration Act. </p>
<p>
  [18] In his written submissions following my correspondence with the parties, 
  counsel for the husband also now seeks an extension of time to move to set aside 
  the order of Scott J. under s. 50 of the Arbitration Act. I decline to do so. 
  When that order was signed there was no appeal outstanding. As I stated above, 
  the husband chose not to immediately file a Notice of Appeal to this court after 
  the order of Weekes J., but waited until the order of Scott J. That order will 
  stand unless and until the husband is able to successfully appeal any portion 
  of the arbitration award.</p>
<p>
  Result</p>
<p>
  [19] The time for appeal of the order of Weekes J. is extended to February 20, 
  2004. The husband has obtained an indulgence from the court. He should therefore 
  bear the costs of this motion. They are fixed in the amount of $6,000, inclusive 
  of disbursements and G.S.T., and are payable forthwith and before any further 
  proceedings may be taken by the husband.</p>
