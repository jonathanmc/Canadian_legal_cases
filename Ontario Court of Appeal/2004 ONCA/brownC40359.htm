<p>On appeal from the Order of Justice Faye E. McWatt of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated July 16, 2003. </p>
<p>
  ABELLA J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] On Monday, December 17, 2001, Hermine Brown fell on snow or ice on a municipal 
  sidewalk. On December 27, 2001, ten days later, Ms. Brown served the City with 
  written notice of the accident. The issue in this appeal is whether the action 
  is barred by s. 284(5) of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, which requires 
  that notice of a claim be sent or served within seven days of the accident. 
  This section states: </p>
<p class="indent"> No action shall be brought for the recovery of the damages 
  mentioned in subsection (1) unless notice in writing of the claim and of the 
  injury complained of has been served upon or sent by registered mail to the 
  head or the clerk of the corporation, in the case of a county or township within 
  ten days, and in the case of an urban municipality within seven days, after 
  the happening of the injury, nor unless, where the claim is against two or more 
  corporations jointly liable for the repair of the highway or bridge, the prescribed 
  notice was given to each of them within the prescribed time.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a></p>
<p>
  [2] The City brought a motion for summary judgment, arguing that on Monday, 
  December 24, 2001, the seventh day following the accident, the City Clerk's 
  Office was open its usual hours, from 8:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.</p>
<p>
  [3] The City's motion was dismissed on the basis that Ms. Brown's notice was 
  timely. In holding that the seven day deadline had been met, the motions judge 
  concluded that because Saturday December 22, Sunday December 23, Christmas Day 
  and Boxing Day were holidays, they should be excluded from the computation of 
  the seven days. She relied on the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 
  194, and in particular on Rule 3.01(1)(b), which states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the computation of time under these rules or an order, except where a contrary 
  intention appears,</p>
<p class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> where a period of less than seven days is prescribed, holidays 
  shall not be counted.</p>
<p>
  [4] This Rule applies only to "the computation of time under these rules 
  or an order". But the time requirement in this case is imposed by a statute, 
  the Municipal Act, not by the Rules. Moreover, the notice period in the Municipal 
  Act is seven days, not "less than seven days". Rule 3.01(1)(b), therefore, 
  does not apply to the calculation of the time for service of notice of a claim 
  under the Municipal Act. </p>
<p>
  [5] Such a calculation is governed by s. 28(h) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. I.11, which provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In every Act, unless the contrary intention appears,</p>
<p class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent">
  where the time limited by an Act for a proceeding or for the doing of any thing 
  under its provisions expires or falls upon a holiday, the time so limited extends 
  to and the thing may be done on the day next following that is not a holiday.</p>
<p>
  [6] This means that if, in calculating the seven days, the last day falls on 
  a holiday, the time is extended to the next day that is not a holiday. It does 
  not mean that the time limit can be extended by excluding all holidays from 
  the calculation of the seven days.</p>
<p>
  [7] This methodology is not in conflict with Young v. Mississauga (City) (1993), 
  16 O.R. (3d) 409 (Gen. Div.). Young deals with the definition of "holiday" 
  only for purposes of deciding whether to extend the last day of the notice period 
  if it falls on a day when service is impossible because the municipal offices 
  are closed. That case does not, with respect, bear the interpretation applied 
  by the motions judge, namely, that the notice period should be calculated by 
  excluding all holidays.</p>
<p>
  [8] In this case, the last day of the stipulated period was not a holiday. There 
  was, therefore, no basis for extending the time for sending or serving the notice.</p>
<p>
  [9] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the order of McWatt J. is set aside, 
  and Ms. Brown's action is dismissed. In the circumstances, I would not order 
  any costs against Ms. Brown.</p>
<p> RELEASED: "APR 23 2004" "KMW J.A."</p>
<p>"R.S. Abella J.A."<br>
  "I agree K.M. Weiler J.A."<br>
  "I agree Robert P. Armstrong J.A."</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="a"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> The provision has been amended to change 
  the notice period from seven to ten days. Section 44 of the current Municipal 
  Act, S.O. 2001, c. 25 states:</p>
<p class="indent">(10) No action shall be brought for the recovery of damages 
  under subsection (2) unless, within 10 days after the occurrence of the injury, 
  written notice of the claim and of the injury complained of has been served 
  upon or sent by registered mail to,<br>
  <span class="indent10">(a) the clerk of the municipality; or</span><br>
  <span class="indent10">(b) if the claim is against two or more municipalities 
  jointly responsible for the repair of the highway or bridge, the clerk of each 
  of the municipalities.</span><br>
  <span class="center">&#133;</span><br>
  (12) Failure to give notice or insufficiency of the notice is not a bar to the 
  action if a judge finds that there is reasonable excuse for the want or the 
  insufficiency of the notice and that the municipality is not prejudiced in its 
  defence.</p>
