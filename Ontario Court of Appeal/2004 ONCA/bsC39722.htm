<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice John D. Evans of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice dated March 17, 2003.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] Counsel for the appellant opened this sentence appeal by describing his 
  client's conduct as inappropriate sexual horseplay. We should make it clear 
  that we do not accept that characterization. On several occasions over a period 
  of many months the 33-year old appellant improperly touched the 13-year old 
  complainant. The appellant had become a close friend of the complainant's family 
  and was treated as a member of the family. The complainant described him as 
  being like an uncle. Despite this relationship of friendship and trust, the 
  appellant attempted to touch the complainant on her breasts, offered to show 
  her his penis, kissed her on the mouth and put his tongue in her mouth, had 
  her sit on his lap when he had an erection (albeit they were both fully clothed) 
  and put his hand down her bathing suit and touched her buttocks.</p>
<p>
  [2] The offences also had a serious impact on the complainant although we note 
  that at least some of the members of the family affected by this offence did 
  not support a jail sentence for this offender. That said, the wishes of the 
  family are but one factor that a court will take into account and will never 
  be decisive.</p>
<p>
  [3] We are nevertheless of the view that the sentence of twelve months imprisonment 
  for this first offender was manifestly excessive. As serious as the conduct 
  was, exacerbated by the trust relationship twelve months imprisonment was outside 
  the appropriate range for this kind of conduct for this type of offender.</p>
<p>
  [4] We note that Crown counsel at trial was not opposed to a conditional sentence. 
  The offences appeared to be out of character and this is confirmed not simply 
  by character letters but by a report from a psychiatrist with special expertise 
  in sexual disorders. Despite the strain these offences have put on the appellant's 
  marriage, the appellant's wife remains supportive. The appellant has an excellent 
  work record and is a key man in the small firm where he is employed. That employment 
  is still available to him. The appellant also has strong support within the 
  community.</p>
<p>
  [5] We have given anxious consideration to an appropriate sentence in this case. 
  We cannot disagree with the principle that some brief period of incarceration 
  would have been appropriate bearing in mind the need for denunciation and general 
  deterrence. Thus, the trial judge might have imposed a short jail sentence on 
  the charge of sexual assault and a consecutive conditional sentence on the charge 
  of invitation to sexual touching. </p>
<p>
  [6] At this stage, however, a year after the sentence was originally imposed, 
  we cannot say that incarcerating the appellant would serve the interests of 
  justice. We are fortified in this view by the fresh evidence, which shows the 
  additional hardship that would be visited on the appellant's family if he were 
  incarcerated at this point.</p>
<p>
  [7] Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, set aside the sentence originally 
  imposed and impose a sentence of twelve months imprisonment on each offence 
  to be served concurrently but in the community in accordance with the conditions 
  of a conditional sentence order to commence from the date the order is signed. 
  In addition to the statutory conditions, the appellant will be subject to the 
  following conditions: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) He will be subject to house arrest and remain within his 
  residence except for purposes of employment, childcare, to attend religious 
  services and to perform community service or as may be permitted by his supervisor 
  in writing;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) He will perform sixty hours of community service during 
  the time of the conditional sentence;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) He will have no contact with the complainant or her family;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) He will take such counselling as may be recommended by this 
  supervisor; and</p>
<p class="indent">(e) He will abstain from owning, possessing or carrying any 
  weapon; the appellant will have twenty days from the date of this order to dispose 
  of any weapons in his possession.</p>
<p>
  [8] The period of probation as imposed by the trial judge will remain with the 
  additional term that the appellant will perform sixty hours of community service 
  during the period of the probation.</p>
