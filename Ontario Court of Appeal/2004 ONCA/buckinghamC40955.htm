<p>On appeal from the decision of Justice Heidi S. Levenson Polowin of the Superior 
  Court of Justice sitting as a Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge, dated November 
  14, 2003 dismissing an appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Paul H. 
  Megginson of the Ontario Court of Justice on September 12, 2003.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant applies for leave pursuant to s. 839(1) of the Criminal Code 
  to appeal the decision of Polowin J. of the Superior Court of Justice dismissing 
  his appeal of his conviction for assault by Megginson J. of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice on September 12, 2003.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant and complainant were married for eighteen years and had two 
  teenaged children. The couple separated in October 2000 and the complainant 
  moved into her brother's apartment. The incident giving rise to the charge against 
  the appellant took place in the lobby of the apartment building. Part of the 
  altercation was witnessed by the complainant's brother, who testified at trial.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant advances four grounds of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [4] The summary conviction appeal judge stated that the trial judge "turned 
  his mind to the defence of self-defence, rejected it and gave reasons why." 
  The appellant contends that this passage constitutes a misapprehension of the 
  basis for the trial judge's finding of guilt because the trial judge did not 
  "reject" the appellant's evidence of self-defence; rather, he held 
  that there was "no air of reality" to it. Accordingly, the appellant 
  contends, the summary conviction appeal judge did not properly adjudicate on 
  the trial judge's ruling respecting the "air of reality" test for 
  self-defence.</p>
<p>
  [5] We disagree. It is clear from the trial judge's reasons, read as a whole, 
  that he did consider and reject the appellant's evidence of self-defence. The 
  trial judge set out a number of specific reasons that support this conclusion 
  - the appellant knew that his presence at the apartment was unwanted; his demeanour 
  throughout the entire incident was consistent with his having been the aggressor 
  from the outset; he started with verbal aggression, but advanced beyond this 
  as the incident continued; and he refused to leave the building, despite being 
  asked to do so on several occasions.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant next contends that the summary conviction appeal judge erred 
  in concluding that the trial judge properly applied the test in R. v. W.(D.) 
  (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.), to the evidence to determine whether a 
  reasonable doubt regarding the appellant's guilt existed. In particular, the 
  appellant submits that the trial judge did not deal properly with inconsistencies 
  in the complainant's testimony.</p>
<p>
  [7] We disagree. On this issue, the summary conviction appeal judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  While Justice Megginson did not specifically refer to the test in R. v. W.(D.) 
  (and such specific reference is not required) it seems to me that he applied 
  the test in W.(D.) when he limited his finding of guilt to the one incident. 
  While he noted the discrepancies in her testimony, he found her to be an essentially 
  credible witness. He found her evidence to be supported by her brother whom 
  he found credible. While the Appellant contends that the Trial Judge was left 
  in reasonable doubt as to the other alleged incidents, and thus should have 
  been in doubt as to the appellant's claim of self-defence, Justice Megginson 
  found that the evidence did not support this defence based on other factors 
  that is, that it was the Appellant who was the aggressor from the beginning, 
  who instigated contact, was asked to leave on several occasions etc. Justice 
  Megginson appears to have weighed and assessed the evidence as a whole, in accordance 
  with the principles of R. v. W.(D.).</p>
<p>
  We agree with this analysis and conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant contends that the summary conviction appeal judge erred by 
  not concluding that the trial judge's reasons for judgment, because of their 
  brevity, insulated his decision from meaningful appellate review contrary to 
  R. v. Sheppard (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 298 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Maharaj (12May2004) 
  (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [9] We disagree. Although the trial judge's reasons were relatively brief (two 
  pages), they fulfil the important role, enunciated in Sheppard, of informing 
  the accused, and a reviewing court, of why the accused was convicted. The trial 
  judge acknowledged discrepancies in the complainant's testimony, but found her 
  to be "essentially credible". He also found the complainant's brother 
  to be a credible witness. On the incident that formed the basis for the finding 
  of guilt, he accepted their testimony. He also rejected, with reasons, the appellant's 
  defence of self-defence.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant contends that the summary conviction appeal judge erred by 
  not finding that the trial judge's finding of guilt was unreasonable. In our 
  view, there is no basis for this submission.</p>
<p>
  [11] Leave to appeal is granted. The appeal is dismissed.</p>
