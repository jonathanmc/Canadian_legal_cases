<p>On appeal from the acquittal by Justice Hubert J. Campbell of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice dated January 8, 2003.</p>
<p>
  McMURTRY C.J.O.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The respondent, David Burley, was charged with one count of impaired driving 
  causing bodily harm and one count of driving "over eighty". He pleaded 
  not guilty.</p>
<p>
  [2] At trial, the defence brought a successful application to exclude the results 
  of breath samples under s. 24(2) of the Charter on the basis that his right 
  to counsel under s. 10(b) had been infringed. The trial judge found that the 
  respondent's Charter rights had been breached and accordingly made an order, 
  under s. 24(2) of the Charter, excluding all evidence which followed the breach, 
  which included the breath sample readings taken from the respondent. As a result, 
  the respondent was acquitted on both counts.</p>
<p>
  [3] The central issue on the Charter application was whether the respondent 
  was able to effectively exercise his right to counsel given the level of privacy 
  he was afforded in the particular hospital setting.</p>
<p>
  [4] For the reasons outlined below, I am of the view that the appeal should 
  be allowed.</p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [5] The respondent was involved in an automobile accident in which he lost control 
  of the vehicle he was driving, causing it to turn over in a ditch. The other 
  occupants of the car were his seven year old son and the eight year old daughter 
  of a family friend. The young boy was the most severely injured of the three 
  occupants and had to be transported to the Hospital for Sick Children. The respondent 
  complained of back pain and was taken to the hospital by the arresting officer 
  as he did not want to ride in the ambulance.</p>
<p>
  [6] A police officer and a civilian at the scene both testified that there was 
  a strong odour of alcohol on the respondent's breath and other signs of inebriation. 
  The respondent admitted to having consumed alcohol before the accident. The 
  respondent was arrested and read his rights. The arresting officer asked whether 
  the respondent would like to call a lawyer or legal aid, to which the respondent 
  responded in the affirmative. The respondent was taken to the hospital where 
  he was given an opportunity to contact legal aid counsel.</p>
<p>
  [7] In order to make a phone call to counsel, the respondent was taken into 
  a small ambulance attendant room which had a desk and two chairs. There was 
  a telephone in the room. There was conflicting evidence as to whether there 
  was a door to the room but the respondent testified that he did recall a door.</p>
<p>
  [8] The respondent contacted duty counsel at 7:00 p.m. and at 7:08 p.m. duty 
  counsel called back. He was left alone in the room, and was told that the call 
  would be private and that the officer would not be within earshot. The officer 
  stood approximately 20 feet away down the hallway. The officer testified that 
  he maintained a line of sight to the doorway of the room but could not see or 
  hear the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [9] The respondent testified that he was not comfortable while speaking to duty 
  counsel as he saw an elbow in the doorway, clothed in a blue or black jacket 
  and that he thought it was a police officer. As a result, he felt uncomfortable, 
  constantly moving the phone away from his ear to check the location of the police 
  officer. As a result, the respondent did not believe that he had had an adequate 
  consultation with duty counsel.</p>
<p>
  [10] The respondent remained in the room for nine minutes and he spoke with 
  counsel for five to six minutes. A breath sample was taken after his conversation 
  with duty counsel. At no time did the respondent make any complaint that he 
  was unable to effectively consult with counsel because of his worry that his 
  call could be overhead by the police officer. The respondent also testified 
  that both of the officers he had contact with treated him in a courteous manner 
  and that the breathalyser officer was "super".</p>
<p>
  [11] The respondent testified that he gave the breath sample because he knew 
  that he was required by law to do so but declined to answer questions because 
  he knew his legal rights in that regard.</p>
<p>
  RULING OF TRIAL JUDGE</p>
<p>
  [12] The trial judge found that the arresting officer had acted in a "commendable 
  fashion" in bringing the respondent to the hospital and that there was 
  "absolutely no fault" with what the officer did in the circumstances. 
  He accepted the officer's evidence that he was not within earshot of the respondent 
  and that he had told the respondent that his conversation with duty counsel 
  would be made in private. The trial judge further stated that "I don't 
  know what else he [the officer] could have done".</p>
<p>
  [13] The trial judge, however, found that the hospital hallway was busy and 
  stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [The respondent] was of the view that the police were directly behind him. In 
  any event it is hard to conceive how anyone could feel that he was having a 
  conversation in private with his counsel. There was nothing private about the 
  situation. It would be like consulting a lawyer in the hallways of the Oshawa 
  Centre.</p>
<p>
  [14] There was, however, no evidence before the trial judge to support his comparison 
  with the Oshawa Centre and the respondent did not suggest in his evidence that 
  the traffic in the hospital corridor in any way interfered with his ability 
  to communicate with counsel, other than the appearance of the elbow in the doorway.</p>
<p>
  [15] The trial judge concluded that the respondent was not afforded the opportunity 
  to have a private conversation with counsel and that his s. 10(b) rights were 
  infringed as a result.</p>
<p>
  [16] The Crown submits that in assessing whether or not there had been a s. 
  10(b) violation in this case, the trial judge misapplied the legal test by placing 
  undue weight on the respondent's subjective and unreasonable belief that the 
  call was not in private. The case law does not require the police to facilitate 
  communication with counsel in ideal conditions. Instead, the duty is to provide 
  an opportunity to contact a lawyer within a reasonable time, with the privacy 
  that a detainee would reasonably require in order to consult with a lawyer. 
  </p>
<p>
  [17] The Crown also submits the police have the additional duty of maintaining 
  control over someone suspected of a criminal offence. In the circumstances of 
  this case, and given the situation that evening, objectively viewed, the Crown 
  asserts that privacy afforded to the respondent was more than adequate and the 
  respondent's right to counsel was therefore not infringed.</p>
<p>
  [18] The respondent, on the other hand, submits that the trial judge reasonably 
  concluded that, on the facts found by him, there had been an infringement of 
  the respondent's right to consult counsel in private. This was essentially a 
  finding of fact and there is no basis for appellate interference with that finding 
  as it does not reflect "any palpable or overriding error".</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [19] In R. v. Playford (1987) 40 C.C.C. (3d) 142, Goodman J.A. stated as follows 
  at p.158: </p>
<p class="indent">
  An accused person who believes that his conversation will be overheard by the 
  police, will, of course, be substantially prejudiced in making use of his right 
  to retain and instruct counsel. That does not mean, of course, that every accused 
  who has such belief no matter how unreasonable, can assert that his right to 
  retain and instruct counsel has been infringed.</p>
<p>
  [20] The issue of adequate privacy in a hospital context was considered by O'Connor 
  J. in R. v. Turiff (1998) 82 O.T.C. 180. In that case, the police arrested the 
  accused for impaired driving causing bodily harm. After indicating that he wished 
  to speak to counsel, he was taken to a hospital and left in a wheelchair at 
  a telephone in a hospital hallway. Two arresting officers were present and they 
  retreated some 30 feet down the hall. The accused spoke with duty counsel for 
  approximately nine minutes while medical staff and others made use of the hallway. 
  The trial judge also noted that at no time did the accused wave the officers 
  away or in any way indicate to them that his privacy was violated.</p>
<p>
  [21] The finding of the trial judge in Turiff that the s. 10(b) Charter rights 
  of the accused had not been proven was upheld by this court. O'Connor J. also 
  quite properly noted that the individual factual context must be considered 
  in each case. However, his conclusion suggests that in considering the reasonableness 
  of an accused's concern about a lack of privacy in the particular circumstances 
  an accused should be reasonably expected to make his concerns known to any police 
  officer present.</p>
<p>
  [22] The issue as to whether a degree of diligence on the part of an accused 
  should be expected in relation to consulting counsel was discussed in the Supreme 
  Court of Canada decision of Bartle v. The Queen, 92 C.C.C. (3d) 289. This decision 
  decided that the accused's s. 10(b) rights had been infringed when he was not 
  advised of the availability of legal aid duty counsel. However, Lamer C.J.C. 
  states as follows at p. 301: </p>
<p class="indent"> Importantly, the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is not absolute. 
  Unless a detainee invokes the right and is reasonably diligent in exercising 
  it, the correlative duty on the police to provide a reasonable opportunity and 
  to refrain from eliciting evidence will either not arise in the first place 
  or will be suspended. [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [23] The requirement of at least a reasonable degree of diligence on the part 
  of an accused was also referred to by this court in R. v. Richfield, 178 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 23 where Weiler J.A. stated at para 7: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Whether legal advice has been sought diligently by the detained person depends 
  on the situation.</p>
<p>
  At para. 8, she again refers to the expectation that the accused will exercise 
  reasonable diligence in exercising the right to counsel.</p>
<p>
  [24] In my view, in considering whether there has been a s. 10(b) breach related 
  to the absence of reasonable privacy in consulting counsel, one must examine 
  the totality of the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [25] In this case, the respondent was informed of his right to counsel and he 
  did speak to duty counsel while alone in a room. He had a good rapport with 
  the only officer present during the call and was told by that officer that he 
  would not be standing within earshot. The respondent spoke to counsel for five 
  to six minutes. At no time did he suggest to the officer present that he was 
  concerned about his privacy. He did not ask that the door be closed or that 
  he be given an opportunity to make a second call.</p>
<p>
  [26] The facts in this appeal are similar to the facts of this court in R. v. 
  Cairns [2004] O.J. No. 210 which was released on January 28, 2004. In Cairns, 
  the appellant was informed of her right to counsel and was provided the opportunity 
  of speaking alone with duty counsel in a room. She spoke with duty counsel for 
  several minutes and gave no indication that her conversation was not private 
  or that her conversation with duty counsel was inhibited.</p>
<p>
  [27] In Cairns, the trial judge did not find any breach of s. 10(b) of the Charter. 
  In dismissing the appeal, the court at para. 10 stated as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is the appellant who bears the burden of establishing on the balance of probabilities 
  that her Charter right has been violated. In cases where there is no actual 
  invasion of privacy, there may still be a breach of s. 10(b) where the accused 
  establishes that he or she believed that he or she could not retain and instruct 
  counsel in private and further, that such a belief was reasonably held in the 
  circumstances.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [28] In my view, the evidence before the trial judge was not capable of supporting 
  the trial judge's conclusion that there had been a s. 10(b) Charter breach. 
  The belief of the respondent that he could not retain and instruct counsel in 
  private was not reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [29] In the result, the appeal is allowed and a new trial ordered.</p>
