<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The responding party requests costs with respect to three proceedings - 
  its opposition to a stay motion in this court, its opposition to the application 
  for leave to appeal and this motion for costs. In all, the responding party 
  claims approximately $53,000.00 costs on a partial indemnity scale and $67,000.00 
  on a substantial indemnity scale.</p>
<p>[2] We have reviewed the submissions of the parties. In addition to costs of 
  the leave to appeal motion already ordered in the amount of $1500, including 
  GST and disbursements, in our view the responding party is entitled to costs 
  of the stay motion. Although the Ministry was successful in obtaining a stay 
  pending leave to appeal, the motion for leave to appeal was unsuccessful and 
  the stay dissolved. The Ministry's decision to terminate the responding party's 
  funding and to seize control of its assets has been quashed. In these circumstances, 
  it is appropriate to award costs to the wronged party, a registered charity 
  whose program was terminated, without notice, as a result of the Ministry's 
  actions. </p>
<p>[3] However, given the nature of the proceedings involved and the overlap of 
  the materials that would have been used in the Divisional Court with those filed 
  on the stay motion, we consider the amounts claimed to be excessive. We allow 
  costs for the stay proceeding in the amount of $20,000.00, inclusive of G.S.T. 
  and disbursements. </p>
<p>[4] We have reconsidered our costs order for the leave to appeal motion, as 
  requested by the responding party, but decline to change that order. </p>
