<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] After a seven-day trial, Mr. Bytyqi was convicted of three counts of assault 
  with a weapon and two counts of uttering death threats. The incidents involved 
  his wife and his two children. The trial judge imposed a suspended sentence 
  and two years probation, a fire arms prohibition, and a D.N.A. order. The Crown 
  appeals, seeking a custodial sentence.</p>
<p>[2] Mr. Bytyqi's assault on his ten- and six-year-old children occurred because 
  he thought they were being too noisy. He held a knife to each of their throats, 
  telling them that he was going to kill them. His assault on his wife occurred 
  when Mr. Bytyqi was in a jealous rage during which he slapped and kicked his 
  wife, hit her with a chair, and chased her out of their home. When she attempted 
  to return, he locked her out. When he permitted her to enter the house, he accused 
  her of being with another man and demanded that she undress so that he could 
  inspect her to confirm his accusation. </p>
<p>[3] The reasons for judgment of the very experienced trial judge show great 
  compassion and concern for this family and its plight. It is our view, however, 
  that they reflect error in over-emphasizing Mr. Bytyqi's prospects for rehabilitation 
  and integration into Canadian society over the need, in circumstances of domestic 
  violence, for deterrence and denunciation.</p>
<p>[4] By the time of trial, the family was separated, the children lived with 
  the wife, and there was no contact between the children and their father or 
  their paternal grandparents. The trial judge expressed his hope that the children 
  would resume seeing their father and grandparents. He also expressed his appreciation 
  of the "pressures and frustrations" caused by the family's move from 
  Kosovo to Canada. In his reasons, the trial judge said that had Mr. Bytyqi been 
  born or raised in Canada, he would have imposed a significant jail term. In 
  our view, it is an error in principle to hold individuals "born or raised" 
  in Canada - on that ground alone - to a higher standard of conduct than those 
  who chose to move to Canada as adults. </p>
<p>[5] There were reasons not to impose a lengthy custodial sentence. This was 
  a first offence. Since the commission of the offence, the respondent had lost 
  touch with his children, who no longer wished to see him. He posed no further 
  danger to his wife or to his children. He expressed great remorse. A number 
  of factors, however, compel the imposition of a custodial sentence, including 
  the use of a weapon against vulnerable children and the extent of the assault 
  on the respondent's wife. Further, these incidents were not the first incidents 
  of unacceptable behaviour by Mr. Bytyqi towards his family. The evidence at 
  trial suggested that the respondent had exhibited some violent behaviour towards 
  his spouse before he and his family immigrated to Canada.</p>
<p>[6] In fashioning a sentence, the trial judge expressed concern that a custodial 
  sentence would make it difficult for Mr. Bytyqi to provide financial and other 
  support for his parents. There was evidence, however, that his parents, who 
  were in their late sixties, were able to care for themselves and had help from 
  their extended family. Since Mr. Bytyqi remained unemployed, they were not financially 
  dependent upon him and their income would remain unchanged.</p>
<p>[7] Denunciation and general deterrence were the paramount considerations in 
  the circumstances of this case. A custodial sentence was required. A further 
  period of six months has passed, however, since the suspended sentence was imposed 
  on Mr. Bytyqi. We take that into account, together with the five days that Mr. 
  Bytyqi spent in pretrial custody, and the other factors set out in these reasons, 
  in determining an appropriate sentence. </p>
<p>[8] Leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed and the sentence 
  is varied to substitute a custodial term of six months incarceration for the 
  suspended sentence. The balance of the sentence remains unchanged.</p>
