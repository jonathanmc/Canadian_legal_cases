<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant alleges that the trial judge made numerous errors with respect 
  to orders of child and spousal support, custody and mobility, and equalization. 
  In addition, the appellant alleges that there were serious procedural irregularities 
  that deprived the appellant of a fair trial.</p>
<p>
  Child and Spousal Support</p>
<p>
  [2] The central issue in relation to child and spousal support is the trial 
  judge's findings in relation to the husband's income. The appellant has failed 
  to persuade us that there are reversible errors on this issue. At trial the 
  appellant eventually conceded that his income for 2001 was $158,00.00. Based 
  upon that concession, the uncontradicted expert evidence of Paula White, and 
  upon other evidence relating to the appellant's earnings, the trial judge found 
  that the appropriate figure was $177,00.00. There was evidence to support that 
  finding and we see no palpable and overriding error that would allow us to interfere. 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] With respect to the appellant's income for 2002, the trial judge noted that 
  the difficulty in making this determination lay in the appellant's failure to 
  produce financial statements for that year. The trial judge had to do the best 
  he could on the basis of the limited disclosure made by the appellant. On appeal, 
  we were invited to disagree with the trial judge's findings and to make our 
  own calculations based on various invoices and statements for a portion of 2002. 
  It is plainly not open to us to retry the case, although we were invited to 
  do so by the appellant. In the absence of any palpable and overriding error, 
  we are not entitled to interfere with the findings of fact made by the trial 
  judge. </p>
<p>
  [4] We see no merit in the other arguments raised by the appellant with respect 
  to child and spousal support. We add that if indeed there have been material 
  changes in the income or means of the parties, that is a matter to be addressed 
  by way of a variation application, not by way of appeal.</p>
<p>
  Custody and Mobility</p>
<p>
  [5] The central issue here was whether the respondent should be entitled to 
  move to New York with the children. The trial judge carefully considered the 
  factors enumerated in Gordon v. Goertz, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27 and found that it 
  would be in the best interest of the children to allow the respondent to move 
  to New York and to take the children with her. The appellant argues that the 
  trial judge erred by failing to accord sufficient weight to the expert report 
  of Dr. Weir. We do not agree. The trial judge was not bound by the recommendations 
  of Dr. Weir, particularly as the trial judge found that evidence simply did 
  not support significant factual assumptions made by Dr. Weir with respect to 
  the capacity of the parties to undertake childcare duties. It is well-established 
  that trial judges are to be accorded a high degree of deference in this area 
  and we see no material error in law or in his appreciation of the facts in this 
  case that would justify us to interfere.</p>
<p>
  [6] Again, we note that if there has been any material change in the circumstances 
  since the date of the trial, that is a matter to be dealt with by way of a variation 
  application, not by appeal to this court.</p>
<p>
  Equalization</p>
<p>
  [7] In calculating the equalization payment, the trial judge found that the 
  value of five advances made by the husband's parents to the parties totalling 
  $192,00.00, claimed by the appellant as debts, should be discounted to five 
  percent of their face value. In our view, there was evidence to support that 
  finding. The debts were old and no demand had been made save on one, and that 
  had been motivated by the separation of the parties. The moneys had been advanced 
  to help the parties out with the purchase of homes with limited expectation 
  of repayment, and the appellant's father testified that he would not have looked 
  for the money nor would he take any action against his son to collect the debts.</p>
<p>
  [8] In our view, the trial judge properly followed the approach in Poole v. 
  Poole (2001) O.J. No. 2154 (S.C.) and Salamon v. Salamon (1997), O.J. No 852 
  (Gen Div.) in discounting the value of this alleged debt. We do not accept the 
  submission that the trial judge was not entitled to value the alleged debts 
  in this manner. Courts are frequently called upon to assess the actual worth 
  of a claim, asset or liability and we agree with the statement in Poole, supra 
  at para 35: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Even though debt may have a specified face value, if the evidence indicates 
  that it is unlikely that the promissor will ever be called upon to pay the debt, 
  the value of the debt should be discounted to reflect that reality.</p>
<p>
  Procedural Irregularities</p>
<p>
  [9] We do not accept the submission that the appellant was denied a fair trial 
  by the trial judge's management and conduct of the proceedings. This case had 
  originally been assigned five days for trial. The respondent was not able to 
  be present on the first day and the appellant's counsel was unavailable the 
  second day. The parties agreed to try the case in three days. When that proved 
  impractical, they were accorded an additional two days for trial. In this context, 
  the trial judge was entitled to exercise his discretion in managing and controlling 
  the proceedings with a view to completing the trial within the time agreed to 
  by the parties. In our view, the trial judge did not exceed the limits of that 
  authority.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant emphasizes a difficulty that arose in relation to the evidence 
  of Dr. Weir, the expert agreed to by the parties, on the issue of custody and 
  mobility. Dr. Weir was unavailable for the week assigned to the trial. The parties 
  agreed that his report would be filed and that the respondent would be entitled 
  to question its weight given Dr. Weir's unavailability for cross-examination. 
  Counsel for the appellant complains that the trial judge refused to allow her 
  to cross-examine the respondent by confronting her with Dr. Weir's conclusions. 
  The trial judge did not permit her to do so because, at the time of the cross-examination 
  was being conducted, it did not appear that Dr. Weir would be a witness. We 
  think the trial judge erred in this regard. However, we do not regard this error 
  as being fatal to these proceedings. The appellant was not prevented from canvassing 
  the issues raised by Dr. Weir in her cross-examination of the respondent. Moreover, 
  after Dr. Weir was called as a witness, she could have renewed her request to 
  cross-examine the respondent on the details of his report. She did not do so. 
  In any event, we are not persuaded that the appellant was foreclosed in any 
  material way from advancing the substance of his case before the trial judge 
  and we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [11] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. The parties are to make brief written 
  submissions with respect to costs. The respondent is to serve and file his submissions 
  within ten days of the release of these reasons and any reply from the appellant 
  to be made seven days thereafter.</p>
