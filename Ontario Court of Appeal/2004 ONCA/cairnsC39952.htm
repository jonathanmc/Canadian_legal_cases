  On appeal from the judgment of Justice William Festryga of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, dated April 11, 2003, dismissing the appeal from conviction by Justice 
  Morris J. Perozak of the Ontario Court of Justice on March 19, 2002.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, Jill Cairns, was convicted at trial of driving with over 
  80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.</p>
<p>
  [2] At trial, the defence brought a motion under ss. 10(b) and 24(2) of the 
  Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms seeking the exclusion of the appellant's 
  breath samples on the basis that she had not had an opportunity to exercise 
  her right to counsel in private. The trial judge dismissed her motion on the 
  basis that here was no breach of her Charter rights and entered a conviction 
  against the appellant. Her appeal to the summary conviction appeal court was 
  dismissed. She now appeals to this court. </p>
<p>
  [3] For the reasons given below, we are of the view that the appeal should be 
  dismissed. </p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant was stopped by the police while driving her car on highway 
  403 in Hamilton. After failing a roadside screening test, she was taken to the 
  Burlington police detachment to provide a breath sample. The appellant was informed 
  of her right to counsel and the police arranged to have duty counsel contact 
  the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [5] When duty counsel called, the call was transferred to the holding cell area 
  where the appellant spoke in private with counsel for between three and five 
  minutes. The room was equipped with a video camera. The camera was not operating 
  while the appellant was in the room. The camera had no audio monitoring capabilities. 
  The appellant was not told that the camera was not on nor was she told that 
  it did not have audio capabilities. The appellant did not say anything to the 
  police or act in a manner so as to indicate that she had any concern about the 
  video camera. </p>
<p>
  [6] Following her conversation with duty counsel, the appellant provided two 
  breath samples each of which had readings of 138 milligrams of alcohol in 100 
  millilitres of blood. </p>
<p>
  [7] At trial, the sole issue was whether the appellant's s. 10(b) right had 
  been infringed. The appellant testified that she believed that the video camera 
  was on, that the police were watching and listening to her, and that this bothered 
  her. She did not testify that her conversation with duty counsel had been affected 
  by the presence of the camera or her reaction to the camera. She acknowledged 
  that the police officers had been nice to her. There was no evidence that the 
  appellant had discussed her concern with duty counsel during their conversation.</p>
<p>
  [8] The trial judge was not satisfied that the appellant had proved, on a balance 
  of probabilities, that her right to counsel had been breached by a failure of 
  the police to provide her with privacy. He made the following ruling on the 
  s. 10(b) motion: </p>
<p class="indent"> The evidence in this voir dire in this court's view does not 
  disclose evidence that the privacy was breached, or the right to consult counsel 
  was infringed. There is no evidence that the machine was on, or whether the 
  video camera was being monitored, and certainly no evidence that any officer 
  could overhear, in the circumstances, the conversation of the accused with duty 
  counsel.</p>
<p class="indent">The officer testified here that privacy was allowed, and this 
  court is not satisfied that the applicant was proven, on the balance of probabilities, 
  that rights to counsel have been breached by failing to provide privacy.</p>
<p class="indent">The presence of the camera is entirely speculative, and the 
  court finds the cases cited are distinguishable, and the video camera presence, 
  per se, is not tantamount to the officer being present, and the application 
  is denied.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  The summary conviction appeal judge affirmed the trial decision.</p>
<p>
  THE ISSUE</p>
<p>
  [9] The right to retain and instruct counsel includes the right to do so in 
  private. The appellant, in fact, did speak to counsel in private. The police 
  could not and did not overhear her conversation with duty counsel. The question 
  then becomes whether her right was infringed because of the presence of the 
  video camera which caused her concern that the police were listening to her 
  while she spoke with duty counsel. </p>
<p>ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [10] It is the appellant who bears the burden of establishing, on the balance 
  of probabilities, that her Charter right has been violated. In cases where there 
  is no actual invasion of privacy, there may still be a breach of s. 10(b) where 
  the accused establishes that he or she believed that he or she could not retain 
  and instruct counsel in private and further, that such a belief was reasonably 
  held in the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [11] In the case at bar, the appellant testified in examination in chief that 
  when she was on the telephone to duty counsel she saw a camera in the corner 
  of the left hand side of the room. She had no idea whether the camera was capable 
  of allowing officers to hear her conversation but she believed she was being 
  watched and that officers were listening to her as well. In cross-examination 
  she said that it bothered her but she did not think to ask the officer about 
  it.</p>
<p>
  [12] The trial judge accepted the evidence of the officer that the appellant 
  was accorded privacy. There was no evidence that the camera was on, that it 
  was being monitored or that an officer was able to overhear the appellant's 
  conversation with duty counsel. The trial judge was not satisfied that he could 
  conclude that the presence of the camera, without more, was tantamount to an 
  officer being present in the room.</p>
<p>
  [13] In other words, the presence of the camera alone was not enough to found 
  either a breach in fact, or a reasonable belief in a breach by the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [14] The latter conclusion by the trial judge is a finding of fact. In our view, 
  based on the evidence, the trial judge was entitled to reach the conclusion 
  he did. The appellant was informed of her right to counsel; she was provided 
  with the opportunity to speak with duty counsel by telephone in a room alone; 
  she spoke with counsel for several minutes; she gave no indication to the officer 
  of any concern that her conversation was not private; she made no inquiry of 
  the officer of the status of the camera; she did not suggest that her conversation 
  was inhibited; duty counsel did not complain. This case can be compared with 
  R. v. Carroll (2002), 24 M.V.R. (4th) 248 where Lane J. found that the appellant 
  had established that his belief that his conversation with counsel could be 
  heard by officers was reasonable.</p>
<p>
  [15] Based on the totality of those circumstances, it was open to the trial 
  judge in this case to conclude that the appellant had not satisfied him on a 
  balance of probabilities that at the time of her call to duty counsel she had 
  a reasonable belief that the video camera in the holding cell where the telephone 
  was located allowed officers to overhear her conversation, and that she was 
  therefore not being accorded her right to have a private consultation with counsel.</p>
<p>
  [16] Accordingly, we agree with the judgments below that the appellant has failed 
  to establish that her s. 10(b) right was infringed. </p>
