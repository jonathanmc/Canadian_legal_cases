<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We would grant leave to appeal the order directing a new trial but would 
  dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge appears to have concluded that the police officer had no 
  legal justification for approaching the appellant's vehicle absent some basis 
  for thinking that the appellant was in violation of the Highway Traffic Act 
  or some other legislation. The appellant's vehicle was parked in the public 
  parking area of a plaza. The officer had followed the vehicle into the public 
  parking area. The trial judge appears to have further concluded that absent 
  legal justification for approaching the appellant while he was sitting in his 
  vehicle, the officer arbitrarily detained the appellant when he spoke to him 
  in contravention of s. 9 of the Charter. The trial judge went on to hold that 
  while speaking to the appellant, the officer &quot;conscripted the odour of 
  alcohol as he approached the vehicle.&quot; He excluded the breathalyzer results 
  and acquitted the appellant.</p>
<p>[3] Like the Summary Conviction Appeal Court Judge, we disagree with this analysis. 
  The officer needed no legal authority to approach the appellant while he was 
  sitting in his vehicle in the public parking area and he needed no legal authority 
  to speak to the appellant. There is no evidence upon which it could be said 
  that the appellant was detained by the officer within the meaning of detention 
  as explained in R. v. Therens (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (SCC).</p>
<p>[4] For these reasons, leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
