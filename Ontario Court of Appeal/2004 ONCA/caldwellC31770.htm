<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal of the June 8, 1998 order of Justice Desotti designating 
  the appellant a dangerous offender under part XXIV of the Criminal Code, and 
  sentencing him to an indefinite period of imprisonment. </p>
<p>[2] The appellant had been convicted on December 1, 1996 of sexual assault 
  upon a child. He had prior convictions involving sexual misconduct with children. 
</p>
<p>[3] The sole issue raised on this appeal is whether the sentencing judge erred 
  in holding that the amendments to the Criminal Code which came into force on 
  August 1, 1997, after the appellant's conviction in 1996, but before his dangerous 
  offender hearing in 1998, did not operate retrospectively. </p>
<p>[4] The sentencing judge held that the appellant was not entitled to consideration 
  for the long-term offender designation because the legislation did not operate 
  retrospectively. The Crown concedes that in light of the decision of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in R. v. Johnson (2003), 177 C.C.C. (3d) 97, the long-term offender 
  legislation applies retrospectively to pre-August 1, 1997 offences. </p>
<p>[5] The appeal is allowed, the order of Desotti J. is set aside, and a new 
  sentencing hearing is ordered pursuant to s. 759(3). </p>
<p>[6] We wish to add that we have been advised that the appellant is making progress 
  in a treatment program at the Regional Treatment Center in Abbotsford, British 
  Columbia. We agree with counsel that it is in the public interest that the appellant 
  be permitted to complete that program and that the result of this appeal not 
  interrupt his treatment. </p>
<p>[7] We understand that the treatment program will be completed on September 
  15, 2004. We agree with counsel that it would be appropriate that the new sentencing 
  hearing be delayed until after that program has been completed. </p>
