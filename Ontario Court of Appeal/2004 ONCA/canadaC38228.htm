<p class="boldcenter">COSTS ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p> [1] Further to this court&#8217;s reasons for judgment in this matter issued 
  on January 20, 2004, we have now received and reviewed the written submissions 
  of the parties on the costs of these proceedings. </p>
<p> [2] The respondents were successful before this court on the two primary issues 
  in these proceedings, which concerned the interpretation of the seizure and 
  detention remedies regarding aircraft established under s. 9 of the Airport 
  Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act, S.C. 1992 c. 5 (the &#8220;Airports Act&#8221;) 
  and s. 56 of the Civil Air Navigation Services Commercialization Act, S.C. 1996, 
  c. 20 (the &#8220;CANSCA&#8221;) and the interpretation of the joint and several 
  liability provision contained in s. 55 of the CANSCA. They were unsuccessful 
  on some subsidiary issues arising on the main appeals. As well, a new hearing 
  before the motions judge was ordered on the issue of reimbursement of the costs 
  of detention of the applicable aircraft and the posting of security in accordance 
  with the order of the motions judge dated December 3, 2001. Those respondents 
  who cross-appealed were unsuccessful on their cross-appeals, which were dismissed 
  in their entirety.</p>
<p> [3] The costs sought by the respondents in respect of the three main appeals 
  are substantial. As set out in the respondents&#8217; bills of cost, filed with 
  this court, the claimed costs are as follows:</p>

<p>[4] The claimed costs include fees and Goods and Services Tax and, where applicable, 
  disbursements and Goods and Services Tax. In all instances save one (GATX/CL 
  Air Leasing Cooperative Association), the respondents&#8217; bills of costs 
  indicate that costs are claimed on a partial indemnity basis. For the purpose 
  of our costs disposition, we have assumed that GATX/CL Air Leasing Cooperative 
  Association&#8217;s costs claim is also calculated on the partial indemnity 
  scale.</p>
<p> [5] The appellants and the respondent RRPF Engine Leasing Limited previously 
  agreed that, as between them, no award of costs should be made in these proceedings. 
  Accordingly, no costs submissions were filed with this court by that respondent. 
</p>
<p> [6] The appellant airport authorities and NAV Canada (collectively, the &#8220;Authorities&#8221;) 
  filed joint costs submissions. They submit that no costs should be awarded in 
  favour of the respondents. In the alternative, if costs are awarded to the respondents, 
  the Authorities argue that the costs should be assessed by an assessment officer 
  or the registrar in bankruptcy, subject to directions by this court concerning 
  reductions for specific items. </p>
<p> [7] Since the introduction in January 2002 of the costs grid under the Rules 
  of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, this court has fixed costs where 
  the record before it permits it to do so. In our view, it is neither necessary 
  nor appropriate in this case to direct an assessment of costs by either an assessment 
  officer or the registrar in bankruptcy. </p>
<p> [8] Several important factors militate against an award of costs to the respondents. 
</p>
<p> [9] First, these proceedings raised novel issues of statutory interpretation 
  that engaged the public interest. A majority of this court stated in its reasons 
  for judgment dated January 20, 2004:</p>
<p class="indent"> This case raised important issues of interpretation concerning 
  the CANSCA and the Airports Act not previously considered by an Ontario court 
  and, at the time of the proceedings before the motions judge, addressed in only 
  one previously reported decision of another Canadian court. In addition, the 
  demise of the Canada 3000 Companies gave rise to issues of broad public interest, 
  as well as matters relating to the commercial rights of the parties. I agree 
  with the motions judge&#8217;s observation in his reasons concerning costs: 
  &#8220;There is also&#8230;an element of public interest in having the seizure 
  rights of the Authorities, which impact upon the travelling public and the travel 
  industry in Canada, being judicially scrutinized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Justice Juriansz, dissenting on other grounds, did not disagree with these 
  conclusions. </p>
<p> [10] It is our view that the novelty of this case and the public interest 
  involved in the resolution of the issues raised by the parties are as relevant 
  to the determination of the costs of these proceedings as they were to the question 
  of the costs of the proceedings before the motions judge.</p>
<p> [11] Second, the respondents were not completely successful in these proceedings. 
  As we have said, the cross-appeals were dismissed in their entirety. As well, 
  this court rejected the respondents&#8217; positions on several issues that 
  had also been raised by them before the motions judge with an equal lack of 
  success. Although we do not suggest that these issues were of central concern 
  or prominence, in combination with the cross-appeals they received full attention 
  in the various facta filed by the parties and, in some instances, occupied part 
  of the time spent in oral argument before this court. There is no doubt that 
  pursuit of these matters before this court extended the oral and written submissions 
  of the parties, increased the volume of materials to be prepared by the parties 
  and considered by this court, added to the number and complexity of the issues 
  to be argued, and increased the legal costs of the litigants.</p>
<p> [12] Third, it cannot be said that the Authorities acted unreasonably in bringing 
  their appeals. The respondents acknowledge that the main appeals raised intricate 
  and complex legal issues and arguments. In that context, the importance of the 
  interpretative issues raised, their considerable significance to the aviation 
  industry and to the traveling public, and the impact on these proceedings of 
  the lack of established jurisprudential authority concerning the key issues 
  to be determined by this court cannot be over-emphasized.</p>
<p> [13] It is also relevant that the Authorities are not-for-profit corporations 
  whose mandate is to provide required services to facilitate air travel within 
  Canada. Although it is true that the issues raised were of commercial importance 
  to the Authorities, as well as to the respondents, it is also true that the 
  Authorities are public entities who raised issues of broad public import in 
  their appeals.</p>
<p> [14] In some circumstances, although not all, the nature of the issues raised 
  in complex litigation will warrant a departure from the usual rule that costs 
  should follow the event. This is such a case.</p>
<p> [15] Taking all relevant factors into account, we conclude that a fair and 
  reasonable disposition is to exercise our discretion to award no costs of the 
  appeals or the cross-appeals. Accordingly, no costs are awarded in these proceedings.</p>
