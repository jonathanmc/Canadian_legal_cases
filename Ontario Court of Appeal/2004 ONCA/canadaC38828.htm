<p>On appeal from the orders of Justice John D. Ground of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated December 3, 2001 and May 7, 2002.</p>
<p>CRONK J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] These appeals and cross-appeals arise out of the November 2001 collapse 
  of Canada 3000 Airlines Limited/Lignes A&eacute;riennes Canada 3000 Limit&eacute;e 
  ("Canada 3000") and Royal Aviation Inc. ("Royal"), which 
  together operated Canada's second largest airline, and their parent company, 
  Canada 3000 Inc. (collectively, the "Canada 3000 Companies"). </p>
<p>
  [2] These proceedings raise two primary issues. The first issue concerns the 
  inter-pretation of the joint and several liability provision contained in s. 
  55 of the Civil Air Navigation Services Commercialization Act, S.C. 1996, c. 
  20 (the "CANSCA"). The second issue relates to the interpretation 
  of the seizure and detention remedies concerning aircraft established under 
  s. 9 of the Airport Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act, S.C. 1992 c. 5 (the 
  "Airports Act") and s. 56 of the CANSCA. Several subsidiary issues 
  also arise in these proceedings, as discussed later in these reasons. </p>
<p>
  I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  A. CCAA and Bankruptcy Proceedings</p>
<p> [3] By order of Ground J. of the Superior Court of Justice (the "motions judge") 
  dated November 8, 2001, the Canada 3000 Companies obtained protection under 
  the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 (the "CCAA") 
  and Deloitte &amp; Touche Inc. was appointed monitor in the ensuing CCAA proceedings 
  (the "CCAA Order"). At that time, the Canada 3000 Companies were indebted to 
  Greater Toronto Airports Authority ("GTAA"), which operates Lester B. Pearson 
  International Airport in Toronto, in the approximate amount of $13 million and 
  to other Canadian airport authorities, identified in Schedule "A" to these reasons, 
  in the approximate amount of $8.35 million for various airport charges. As well, 
  they owed NAV Canada, the operator of Canada's civil air navigation system, 
  approximately $7.4 million in unpaid charges for civil air navigation services. 
  <a name="r1"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a></p>
<p>
  [4] Although the CCAA Order contemplated the continuation of their operations 
  during restructuring efforts, Canada 3000 and Royal ceased operations during 
  the evening of November 8, 2001. On the following day, NAV Canada applied under 
  s. 56(1) of the CANSCA for court authorization to seize and detain certain aircraft 
  in the possession of Canada 3000 and Royal. GTAA also applied on the same day 
  for various relief against Canada 3000; it did not seek leave of the court at 
  that time, however, to seize or detain any aircraft.</p>
<p>
  [5] By order dated November 9, 2001, the motions judge directed that the aircraft 
  operated by Canada 3000 and Royal remain in Canada and not be flown pending 
  further court order. He also ordered that Canada 3000 and Royal take reasonable 
  steps to return any aircraft situated outside of the country to airports in 
  Canada. </p>
<p> [6] On November 10, 2001, the directors and officers of the Canada 3000 Companies 
  suddenly resigned en masse. The next day, the motions judge authorized Deloitte 
  &amp; Touche Inc. to file assignments in bankruptcy under the Bankruptcy and 
  Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985 c. B-3 (the "BIA") on behalf of the Canada 3000 
  Companies and to serve as trustee in bankruptcy of their estates. <a name="r2"></a><a href="#2">[2]</a> 
</p>
<p>
  [7] Prior to their bankruptcies, Canada 3000 and Royal operated a fleet of about 
  thirty-eight aircraft, having a total value of approximately U.S. $1.1 billion 
  (the "Aircraft"), thirty-six of which were provided under aircraft 
  leasing agreements between various of the respondents (collectively, the "Lessors") 
  and Canada 3000. For the purpose of the proceedings before the motions judge 
  and this court, the parties agreed that the Aircraft leasing agreements were 
  to be treated as "true" leases under which the Lessors retained legal 
  title to the Aircraft. As well, two of the respondents, RRPF Engine Leasing 
  Limited and Flight Logistics Inc. (the "Engine Lessors"), leased to 
  Canada 3000 the engines attached to two of the Aircraft. </p>
<p>
  [8] Some of the Aircraft were used by Canada 3000; others were used by Royal. 
  It does not appear that Canada 3000 entered into written subleases with Royal 
  in that regard. All of the Aircraft were registered solely in the name of Canada 
  3000 under the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-2 (the "Aeronautics Act") 
  and regulations made under that Act. </p>
<p>
  [9] On the date of the bankruptcies, rental payments under various of the Aircraft 
  leases were significantly in arrears. In addition, the granting of the CCAA 
  Order, the bankruptcy filings and the cessation of operations by Canada 3000 
  and Royal triggered the automatic termination, or the termination on notice, 
  of the Aircraft leases. As a result, the Lessors were entitled under the terms 
  of the leases to repossess and recover the Aircraft. </p>
<p>
  [10] Throughout November 2001, the trustee in bankruptcy of the Canada 3000 
  Companies took possession of the Aircraft, pending its review of ownership and 
  security claims. The Lessors filed claims under the BIA concerning the Aircraft, 
  in which they requested the immediate return of the Aircraft on the basis that 
  they did not form part of the estates of the bankrupts. </p>
<p>
  [11] On November 12, 2001, GTAA moved for an order authorizing it under s. 9(1) 
  of the Airports Act to seize and detain the Aircraft. On November 23, 2001, 
  the other airport authorities applied for similar relief. Ultimately, all of 
  the seizure and detention motions, including NAV Canada's, were heard by the 
  motions judge in December 2001 and January 2002. </p>
<p>
  [12] The Lessors resisted those motions on the grounds, in part, that the seizure 
  and detention claims were ineffective as against third parties who had legal 
  title to or a security interest in the Aircraft, and that any rights of the 
  Authorities to seize and detain the Aircraft crystallized upon the bankruptcies 
  of the Canada 3000 Companies. The Lessors also initiated cross-motions seeking, 
  among other relief, interim release of the Aircraft and declarations that the 
  Authorities were not entitled to seize or detain them.</p>
<p>
  B. Release Protocols Order</p>
<p>
  [13] By order dated December 3, 2001, the motions judge approved protocols for 
  the interim release of the Aircraft, which had been grounded under his earlier 
  order of November 9, 2001 and retained by the trustee in bankruptcy, to the 
  Lessors on condition that they post security for 110 per cent of the amounts 
  allegedly owing to the Authorities pending the determination of the seizure 
  and detention motions and the Lessors' cross-motions (the "Release Protocols 
  Order"). In his reasons for the Release Protocols Order, the motions judge 
  directed that each party bear its own costs of compliance with the release protocols 
  "regardless of the ultimate disposition of the seizure motions". </p>
<p>
  [14] The record before this court indicates that the trustee in bankruptcy of 
  the Canada 3000 Companies determined that the Lessors were the legal owners 
  of the Aircraft, or authorized to claim the Aircraft on behalf of their legal 
  owners, and that the Aircraft could be released to the Lessors on condition 
  that the applicable Lessors first complied with the security posting requirement 
  of the Release Protocols Order. When the requisite security was posted, the 
  Aircraft were released to the claiming Lessors.</p>
<p>
  [15] On December 7, 2001, the CCAA proceedings involving the Canada 3000 Companies 
  were terminated. The administration of their bankruptcies continued. </p>
<p>
  C. Challenged Affidavit Evidence</p>
<p> [16] In response to the seizure and detention motions and in support of their 
  cross-motions, several Lessors<a name="r3"></a><a href="#3">[3]</a> filed affidavits 
  sworn by Donald G. Gray on December 5, 2001 and December 17, 2001 (the "Gray 
  Affidavits"). The motions judge dismissed NAV Canada's objection to the admissibility 
  of the Gray Affidavits, required that certain parts of the Gray Affidavits be 
  excised, and ruled that the redacted versions of the Gray Affidavits were admissible. 
  In the redacted Gray Affidavits, Mr. Gray, a partner of the law firm representing 
  the Lessors that filed his affidavits, provided evidence concerning part of 
  the legislative history of the CANSCA and of related legislation. The admissibility 
  of the redacted Gray Affidavits is challenged by NAV Canada in these proceedings.</p>
<p>
  D. May 7, 2002 Order</p>
<p>
  [17] By order dated May 7, 2002, the motions judge dismissed the appellants' 
  seizure and detention motions and granted the declaratory relief sought by the 
  Lessors in their cross-motions. As relevant to the issues raised in these proceedings, 
  the motions judge: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) determined that the Authorities' seizure and detention claims are either 
  not affected by the automatic bankruptcy stay provisions of s. 69.3 of the BIA, 
  or that the stay should be lifted to the extent necessary to permit the seizure 
  and detention motions to proceed;</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) subject to certain conditions, held that the outstanding 
  charges in respect of which the Authorities could advance seizure and detention 
  claims include interest on amounts owed up to the date of payment in full or 
  the date of the posting of security therefor;</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) concluded that the exemption provisions of the Airports 
  Act and the CANSCA do not apply to the Aircraft; </p>
<p class="indent"> (iv) held that any seizure and detention rights of the Authorities 
  concerning the Aircraft do not rank in priority to the interests of the Lessors 
  and secured creditors in the Aircraft; </p>
<p class="indent"> (v) held that even if any seizure and detention rights of the 
  Authorities rank in priority to the interests of the Lessors in the Aircraft, 
  they are ineffective concerning the interests of the Engine Lessors in the engines 
  attached to the Aircraft;</p>
<p class="indent"> (vi) declared that none of the Lessors is liable to the Authorities 
  for any outstanding airport or navigation charges; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (vii) ordered the Authorities to reimburse the Lessors for 
  the Lessors' costs concerning the detention of the Aircraft and the posting 
  of security in accordance with the Release Protocols Order (collectively, the 
  "Detention Costs")</p>
<p> (the "May 7, 2002 Order"). As well, by reasons dated 
  July 24, 2002, the motions judge declined to award any costs in the proceedings 
  before him.</p>
<p>
  E. Appeals and Cross-appeals</p>
<p> [18] These proceedings involve three main appeals brought by the Authorities 
  from the May 7, 2002 Order. Cross-appeals have also been brought from the May 
  7, 2002 Order by some of the Lessors.<a name="r4"></a><a href="#4">[4]</a> In 
  addition, five appeals have been brought by some of the Lessors<a name="r5"></a><a href="#5">[5]</a> 
  from that part of the Release Protocols Order described in paragraph 21 of these 
  reasons. The Authorities are respondents to the Lessors' cross-appeals and appeals. 
  The Engine Lessors are respondents to the main appeals only. </p>
<p>
  [19] In the main appeals from the May 7, 2002 Order, the Authorities appeal 
  the dismissal of their seizure and detention motions and the motions judge's 
  ruling requiring them to reimburse the Lessors for their Detention Costs. NAV 
  Canada and the GTAA also appeal the motions judge's ruling that even if any 
  seizure and detention rights rank in priority to the Lessors' interests in the 
  Aircraft, they are ineffective concerning the Engine Lessors' interests in the 
  engines attached to the Aircraft. In addition, NAV Canada appeals the motions 
  judge's ruling that the Lessors are not liable for outstanding civil air navigation 
  charges owed by the Canada 3000 Companies. It also appeals his admission of 
  the redacted versions of the Gray Affidavits.</p>
<p>
  [20] The Airport Authorities further appeal the motions judge's determination 
  that interest on outstanding airport charges ceased accruing on the date of 
  full payment of the charges or on the date of the posting of security therefor. 
  Certain of the Lessors cross-appeal from the motions judge's holding that the 
  Authorities could claim interest on the outstanding charges. The Lessors also 
  seek leave to cross-appeal and, if leave be granted, cross-appeal from the motions 
  judge's decision denying them their costs of the proceedings before him.</p>
<p>
  [21] Finally, certain of the Lessors appeal from the motions judge's ruling, 
  in his reasons for the Release Protocols Order, that each party should bear 
  its own costs of compliance with the release protocols regardless of the ultimate 
  disposition of the seizure and detention motions. In that regard, they submit 
  that the motions judge correctly determined in the May 7, 2002 Order that the 
  Lessors were entitled to be reimbursed by the Authorities for their Detention 
  Costs. </p>
<p>
  [22] For the reasons that follow, save with respect to that part of the May 
  7, 2002 Order requiring the Authorities to reimburse the Lessors for their Detention 
  Costs, I would dismiss the appeals by the Authorities from the May 7, 2002 Order. 
  I would allow that part of the Authorities' appeals concerning reimbursement 
  of the Lessors' Detention Costs and the Lessors' appeals from the Release Protocols 
  Order in connection with the same issue and direct a new hearing before the 
  motions judge on the issue of reim-bursement of the Detention Costs. Finally, 
  I would allow the Lessors leave to cross-appeal from the motions judge's disposition 
  of costs in the proceedings before him, and would dismiss the entirety of the 
  cross-appeals.</p>
<p>
  II. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [23] The issues raised in these proceedings may be grouped as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) are the Lessors liable to NAV Canada under s. 55 of the CANSCA for outstanding 
  civil air navigation charges owed by the Canada 3000 Companies?</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) given the bankruptcies of the Canada 3000 Companies, do 
  the Authorities have seizure and detention rights under s. 9 of the Airports 
  Act and s. 56 of the CANSCA concerning the Aircraft and, where applicable, the 
  engines attached to the Aircraft, ranking in priority to the interests of the 
  legal titleholders to the Aircraft and the engines entitling the Authorities 
  to seize and detain the Aircraft and the engines in the face of claims by the 
  legal titleholders for their repossession and re-covery?</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) are the Authorities entitled to advance seizure and detention 
  claims concerning interest on amounts owing to them and, if so, when does such 
  interest cease to accrue?</p>
<p class="indent"> (iv) are the Authorities liable to reimburse the Lessors for 
  their Detention Costs? </p>
<p class="indent"> (v) did the motions judge err in admitting the redacted Gray 
  Affidavits or, in the alternative, in his assignment of weight to them?</p>
<p class="indent"> (vi) are the Lessors entitled to their costs of the pro-ceedings 
  before the motions judge which resulted in the May 7, 2002 Order?</p>
<p>
  III. RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS </p>
<p>
  [24] Determination of the issues in these proceedings requires consideration 
  of several provisions of the Airports Act, the CANSCA, the Aeronautics Act, 
  and regulations made under the Aeronautics Act. I will refer in these reasons 
  to the relevant provisions of those enactments in the course of discussing the 
  issues in respect of which they are engaged. </p>
<p>
  IV. ANALYSIS </p>
<p>
  [25] Elmer A. Driedger described the "modern principle" of statutory 
  interpretation almost thirty years ago in the first edition of his text, The 
  Construction of Statutes (Toronto: Butterworths, 1974) at 67: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are 
  to be read in their entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense 
  harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention 
  of Parliament.</p>
<p>
  [26] Driedger's formulation has been endorsed repeatedly by the Supreme Court 
  of Canada as the preferred interpretive approach in civil cases: Re Rizzo &amp; 
  Rizzo Shoes Ltd., [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 at paras. 21-23; R. v. Ulybel Enterprises 
  Ltd., [2001] 2 S.C.R. 867 at paras. 28-29; Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership 
  v. Rex, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 26; C.U.P.E. v. Ontario (Minister of Labour), 
  2003 SCC 29 at para. 106; and Parry Sound (District) Social Services Administration 
  Board v. O.P.S.E.U., Local 324, 2003 SCC 42 at para. 41. That contextual and 
  purposive approach controls analysis of the statutory provisions at issue in 
  this case. </p>
<p>
  [27] In considering the interpretive issues raised in these proceedings, it 
  is useful to consider first the legislative framework and the purposes of the 
  CANSCA and the Airports Act.</p>
<p>
  A. Legislative Framework and Purposes of the CANSCA and the Airports Act</p>
<p>
  [28] Statutory enactments sometimes form part of a larger, inter-related legislative 
  framework. For example, in Bell ExpressVu, the Supreme Court of Canada characterized 
  the Radiocommunication Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. R-2 and the Broadcasting Act, S.C. 
  1991, c. 11 as two of the legislative pillars of Canada's broadcasting framework. 
  As described by Iacobucci J. at para. 10 of Bell ExpressVu, both statutes provided 
  important context for determination of the interpretive issues considered in 
  that case. </p>
<p>
  [29] A similar approach, in my view, is apposite in the case at bar. The Aeronautics 
  Act is the central foundational pillar of Canada's legislative framework for 
  the regulation of aeronautics. Prior to the introduction of the CANSCA and the 
  Airports Act, air navigation and airport services in Canada were provided by 
  the federal government under the Aeronautics Act. That Act imposes on the applicable 
  Minister of the Crown, in expansive terms, responsibility "for the development 
  and regulation of aeronautics and the supervision of all matters connected with 
  aeronautics" in Canada. It also confers on the Governor in Council broad 
  regulation-making powers and, on the Minister of Transport, broad regulatory 
  and supervisory powers in relation to civil aeronautics (ss. 4.2 and 4.9 of 
  the Aeronautics Act). </p>
<p>
  [30] In 1992, the Government of Canada elected to privatize various airports 
  formerly owned and operated by the federal government. This was accomplished 
  under the Airports Act, which permits designated local airport authorities to 
  operate and manage airports transferred to them by the federal government. The 
  privatization of Canada's civil air navigation services followed four years 
  later, in 1996, with introduction of the CANSCA. The role of the Government 
  of Canada in the provision of navigation and airport services and the management 
  and operation of national airports continues under the Aeronautics Act in respect 
  of matters not falling within the CANSCA or the Airports Act. In addition, as 
  I will mention later in these reasons, the Government of Canada continues to 
  have central authority concerning such matters as aviation safety and regulation. 
  </p>
<p>
  [31] Thus, since their introduction, both the CANSCA and the Airports Act have 
  served as important pillars, together with the Aeronautics Act, of Canada's 
  overall legislative framework for the regulation of aeronautics.</p>
<p>
  (1) NAV Canada and the CANSCA</p>
<p>
  [32] The creation of NAV Canada and the introduction of the CANSCA flowed from 
  the decision of the federal government in about 1995 to commercialize Canada's 
  civil air navigation system. In introducing Bill C-20, the legislative bill 
  which led to the CANSCA, for second reading in the House of Commons, the then 
  Minister of Transport stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The government announced its decision to proceed with commercialization of air 
  navigation in the 1995 budget. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> NAV Canada was incorporated in May 1995 under part II of the 
  Canada Corporations Act for the purpose of developing, operating and maintaining 
  the air navigation system. &#133; </p>

  …</p>
<p class="indent"> NAV Canada will be responsible for providing all of the air 
  navigation services currently provided by Transport Canada. </p>
<p class="indent"> Transport Canada will be responsible for ensuring the continued 
  safe provision of these services. The new safety regulations developed specifically 
  to address the comer-cialization of the air navigation system will be in place 
  before the transfer happens. Transport Canada will monitor and enforce these 
  regulations in much the same way it now does with the air carrier industry.</p>
<p class="indent"> NAV Canada will be required to have an internal safety management 
  program. In addition, the corporation will not be permitted to reduce the service 
  it provides where it would jeopardize safety. Furthermore, the Aeronautics Act 
  which establishes the regulatory framework to maintain safety in the aviation 
  industry will always take precedence over the com-mercialization legislation.</p>
<p class="center">.
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> The commercialization of the air navigation system is a key 
  part in the government's efforts to modernize the Canadian transportation system. 
  It complements our other transporta-tion initiatives including the commercialization 
  of federal airports, seaports and harbours, the privatization of Canadian National 
  Railways, the commercialization of ferry services and the conversion of Transport 
  Canada's motor vehicle test centre to a government owned but contractor operated 
  facility [emphasis added]. (House of Commons Debates (25 March 1996) at 1153-54 
  (Hon. David Anderson)).</p>
<p>
  [33] On May 15, 1996, the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Transport 
  further commented in the House of Commons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Bill C-20 is intended to deal only with the transfer of Transport Canada's air 
  navigation services to a single not for profit company and with the commercial 
  and economic regul-atory arrangements for the continued operation of those services 
  [emphasis added]. (House of Commons Debates (15 May 1996) at 2821 (Hon. Stanley 
  Keyes)). </p>
<p>
  [34] Subsequently, when moving second reading of Bill C-20 in the Senate, the 
  Honourable Raymond J. Perrault said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  NAV CANADA will be the sole provider of air navigation services in Canada, with 
  the exception, as I noted previously, of the Department of National Defence.</p>
<p class="indent"> NAV CANADA will be responsible for providing all of the air 
  navigation services that Transport Canada currently provides. &#133;As a regulator, 
  Transport Canada will ensure the safe provision of these services. New safety 
  regulations have been developed for this purpose. These regulations have been 
  drawn up specifically for the commercialization of the air navigation system 
  and will be in place before the transfer date. The emphasis is again on safety.</p>
<p class="center"> .&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> What role will Transport Canada play in the future? Transport 
  Canada will provide oversight to the air navigation system ensuring NAV CANADA's 
  regulatory compliance. This role will provide Transport Canada with the ability 
  to ensure the maintenance of service levels in the interests of safety. Again, 
  the emphasis is on safety [emphasis added]. (Senate Debates (10 June 1996) at 
  588-89 (Hon. Raymond J. Perrault)). </p>
<p>
  See also Senate Debates (19 June 1996) at 762 (Hon. Jean-Louis Roux).</p>
<p>
  [35] These comments regarding Bill C-20 indicate that under the CANSCA, it was 
  envisaged that NAV Canada would develop, operate and maintain Canada's civil 
  air navigation system while Transport Canada, under the Aeronautics Act, would 
  perform a regulatory and oversight function to ensure the safe provision of 
  air navigation services. As well, the Aeronautics Act was described as "always 
  tak[ing] precedence over [the CANSCA]." The theme of the "supremacy" 
  of the Aeronautics Act over the CANSCA was emphasized in the House of Commons 
  and the Senate on numerous occasions during debates concerning Bill C-20. See 
  for example, House of Commons Debates (15 May 1996) at 2821 and 2834 (Hon. Stanley 
  Keyes); (29 May 1996) at 3143-44 (Hon. Stanley Keyes); (4 June 1996) at 3394, 
  3410 and 3413 (Hon. Stanley Keyes); and Senate Debates (10 June 1996) at 588-89 
  (Hon. Raymond J. Perrault).</p>
<p>
  [36] Thus, the intent of the CANSCA is to achieve the separation from government 
  of the operational and regulatory responsibilities for Canada's civil air navigation 
  system, by placing day-to-day management responsibilities for the system in 
  the hands of a dedicated services provider, while maintaining Crown regulatory 
  control over the quality and safety of the entire system. The "commercialization" 
  of the system under the CANSCA was accomplished by the Crown's divestiture of 
  designated assets of the system to a non-governmental organization, whose mandate 
  was to operate the system on a not-for-profit basis. This initiative, in turn, 
  was described as a key part of a broader governmental scheme designed to modernize 
  Canada's transportation system. These aspects of the legislative history of 
  the CANSCA support the conclusion that its objects and those of the Aeronautics 
  Act are linked, and form part of a larger, inter-connected legislative framework 
  for the regulation of aeronautics in Canada.</p>
<p> [37] In addition, review of the CANSCA as a whole indicates an express relationship 
  between the two enactments. Several provisions of the CANSCA establish direct 
  links to the Aeronautics Act, including s. 2(2), which provides that words and 
  expressions used in the CANSCA have the same meaning as in s. 3(1) of the Aeronautics 
  Act, "unless a contrary intention appears", and s. 5, which reads: "Nothing 
  in this Act affects the application of the Aeronautics Act."<a name="r6"></a><a href="#6">[6]</a> 
</p>
<p> [38] Similarly, the relationship between the Aeronautics Act and the CANSCA 
  is confirmed by several provisions of the Aeronautics Act.<a name="r7"></a><a href="#7">[7]</a> 
  In addition, and more generally, the overall scheme of the Aeronautics Act confirms 
  the regulatory oversight of the civil air navigation system by the Crown and 
  the powers of the Crown over NAV Canada in that connection.</p>
<p>
  (2) The Airports Act</p>
<p> [39] The Airports Act, introduced in 1992, also formed part of a broad governmental 
  scheme for the modernization of Canada's transportation system. This Act derived 
  from the Government of Canada's announcement in 1985 that it intended to establish 
  a new management structure for the federal airport system in Canada, so as to 
  provide for the direct assumption of management responsibilities for certain 
  federal airports by designated local airport authorities. </p>
<p>
  [40] The objects of that policy, as identified by the parliamentary secretary 
  to the then Minister of Transport during debate of Bill C-15, one of the legislative 
  bills that led to the Airports Act, were described as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he government's objectives from the beginning were to allow the airports 
  to better serve local community interests, to enhance regional economic development 
  potential, and to permit the national airport system to operate in a more cost 
  effective and commercial manner.</p>
<p class="indent"> This policy aims to enhance the efficient commercial operation 
  of federal airports through a more locally responsive management structure. 
  (House of Commons Debates (3 June 1991) at 942 (Hon. Lee Richardson)). </p>
<p>
  [41] The preamble to the Airports Act indicates that it is an enactment "to 
  provide for certain matters in connection with the transfer of certain airports." 
  Section 2(2) of the Airports Act authorizes the Governor in Council to designate 
  by order those entities to which the Minister of Transport is to transfer an 
  airport by sale, lease or other means, and to designate the transfer date. The 
  balance of the Airports Act contains provisions designed to ensure that certain 
  requirements applicable to federally-managed airports, in relation to such matters 
  as language rights, employee wages, pension benefits and labour relations, continue 
  to govern airports transferred under that Act to local airport authorities. 
  As well, as in issue in these proceedings, s. 9 of the Airports Act establishes 
  a seizure and detention remedy in relation to aircraft. </p>
<p>
  [42] Nothing in the Airports Act exempts the application of the Aeronautics 
  Act to airport authorities to which airports are transferred under the Airports 
  Act, or otherwise displaces the application of the Aeronautics Act in relation 
  to the regulation of aeronautics.</p>
<p>
  [43] Moreover, as in the case of the CANSCA, the Airports Act expressly establishes 
  a relationship to the Aeronautics Act in connection with the seizure and detention 
  remedy under s. 9 of the Airports Act. As I will discuss later in these reasons, 
  s. 9(5) of the Airports Act directs that words and expressions used in ss. 9 
  and 10 of the Airports Act "have the same meaning as in the Aeronautics 
  Act". </p>
<p>
  [44] As I have described, the purpose of the CANSCA concerns the day-to-day 
  operation and management of Canada's civil air navigation system by a non-governmental 
  entity, while the Airports Act addresses aspects of the day-to-day operation 
  and management of certain former federal airports by local airport authorities. 
  Both enactments, in my view, are best understood as forming integral parts, 
  together with the Aeronautics Act, of a larger, inter-related legislative framework 
  for the regulation of aeronautics in Canada.</p>
<p>
  [45] NAV Canada argues that the seizure and detention remedy under s. 56 of 
  the CANSCA is similar, but not identical, to the seizure and detention remedy 
  under s. 9 of the Airports Act. It submits that ss. 55 and 56 of the CANSCA 
  must be read together, and that the meaning of the word "owner" under 
  s. 55 informs the meaning and scope of the seizure and detention remedy under 
  s. 56. I agree. Accordingly, I will deal first with NAV Canada's claim that 
  the Lessors are directly liable under s. 55 of the CANSCA for unpaid navigation 
  charges owed to NAV Canada by the Canada 3000 Companies.</p>
<p>
  B. Liability Under Section 55 of the CANSCA</p>
<p> [46] The English and French language versions of s. 55 of the CANSCA read:

<p class="indent">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  (1) Overview of the Positions of the Parties</p>
<p>
  [47] NAV Canada argues that s. 55(1) of the CANSCA is intended to provide it 
  with broad rights to ensure the collection of air navigation charges. For that 
  reason, it asserts, s. 55(1) imposes joint and several liability for such charges 
  on the owners and operators of aircraft. NAV Canada maintains that the plain 
  and ordinary meaning of the word "owner" in s. 55(1) extends to the 
  holders of legal title to aircraft, therefore including the Lessors. It also 
  contends that the definition of "owner" in s. 55(2) of the CANSCA 
  is an expansive, rather than a restrictive, definition. </p>
<p>
  [48] The Lessors submit that the word "owner" as used in the CANSCA 
  generally has the meaning given to it in the Aeronautics Act and the regulations 
  made under that Act. They argue that in the Canadian aviation context, an "owner" 
  of an aircraft is not the holder of legal title but, rather, is the person who 
  has legal custody and control of the aircraft and that an "operator" 
  of an aircraft is the person who has possession of the aircraft in the sense 
  of using the aircraft. Consequently, they maintain that the words "owner" 
  and "operator", as employed in the CANSCA, are unrelated to legal 
  title. They further assert that, on a plain reading of its words, s. 55(2) simply 
  particularizes four specific categories of "owners" who fall within 
  the generally applicable concept of "owner" under the CANSCA, that 
  is, persons with legal custody and control or who are otherwise in possession 
  of aircraft. As the Lessors did not have possession or legal custody and control 
  of the Aircraft at the time of the CCAA Order and the bankruptcies of the Canada 
  3000 Companies, they have no liability to NAV Canada under s. 55(1). </p>
<p>
  [49] The motions judge accepted the Lessors' interpretation of the meaning of 
  "owner" in s. 55 of the CANSCA, holding at para. 56 of his reasons 
  that "owner" as used in that section is restricted "to persons 
  who are operating the aircraft and/or are the registered owners of the aircraft 
  and have custody and control of the aircraft". Thus, he concluded that 
  the legal titleholders to the Aircraft, and persons having a security interest 
  in the Aircraft, are not "owners" of the Aircraft for the purpose 
  of s. 55(1).</p>
<p>
  [50] Before this court, NAV Canada argues that in interpreting s. 55 of the 
  CANSCA, the motions judge: (i) misconstrued and failed to give effect to the 
  purpose of the CANSCA; (ii) ignored the usual and ordinary meaning of the word 
  "owner", and instead adopted a strained and implausible interpretation 
  of that word; and (iii) misinterpreted the legislative context and history of 
  s. 55, including by improperly considering the provisions of the Canadian Aviation 
  Regulations, SOR/96-433 (the "CARs"), regulations made under the Aeronautics 
  Act, and provisions of the CANSCA addressed to "users" of the civil 
  air navigation system. </p>
<p>
  (2) Alleged Misconstruction Error</p>
<p>
  [51] In support of its argument that the motions judge misconstrued and failed 
  to give effect to the purpose of the CANSCA, NAV Canada submits that the motions 
  judge erred in confusing the purposes of NAV Canada and the CANSCA and in placing 
  insufficient emphasis on the commercialization purpose of the CANSCA. NAV Canada 
  further contends that the motions judge erred in confusing the purposes of the 
  CANSCA and the Aeronautics Act. It maintains that the following passage from 
  the motions judge's reasons for the May 7, 2002 Order, especially the underlined 
  part, indicates that he misconstrued the purpose of the CANSCA (at para. 56): </p>
<p class="indent">
  It appears to me that the determination of the use of the [specified words employed 
  in s. 55(2) of the CANSCA] must be made by looking at the purposes and intent 
  of the legislation. NAV Canada is established to provide navigation services 
  for aircraft within Canada and such services are obviously used by the operators 
  of the aircraft and/or persons having custody and control of the aircraft and 
  not by the financiers of the aircraft who do not make use of the navigation 
  services provided by NAV Canada, are unknown to NAV Canada and receive no notice 
  of the imposition of proposed charges and no right to appeal with respect to 
  proposed charges. The proposed charges are billed only to the operators of the 
  aircraft. The specifically listed categories in the definition of "owner" 
  in subsection 55(2) of the [CANSCA] also indicate that the definition is intended 
  to be restricted to persons who are operating the aircraft and/or are the registered 
  owners of the aircraft and have custody and control of the aircraft and not 
  to include persons who have legal title to the aircraft or a security interest 
  in the aircraft but have no custody and control, do not operate the aircraft 
  and do not receive the benefit of the air navigation services provided by NAV 
  Canada [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [52] The motions judge prefaced his comments by reference to "the purposes 
  and intent of the legislation". He then addressed NAV Canada's role under 
  the CANSCA and the nature and the use of the services provided by it. Thereafter, 
  he commented on the meaning of the enumerated categories of persons in s. 55(2) 
  of the CANSCA. </p>
<p>
  [53] The motions judge did not misstate the reason for the creation of NAV Canada 
  and its intended role under the CANSCA when he said that NAV Canada was established 
  "to provide [civil] navigation services for aircraft within Canada". 
  Legal facilitation of that role is a fundamental purpose of the CANSCA. </p>
<p>
  [54] In the balance of his challenged comments, the motions judge set out his 
  con-clusions that the legal titleholders to the Aircraft do not use, have no 
  statutory rights concerning, and derive no benefit from the services provided 
  by NAV Canada. These conclusions, in my view, do not indicate that the motions 
  judge confused the purpose of NAV Canada with that of the CANSCA. Rather, they 
  reflect his assessment of the nature and the use of the services provided by 
  NAV Canada, as authorized by the CANSCA.</p>
<p>
  [55] Accordingly, while the preface to the motions judge's comments might more 
  accurately have referred to the purposes of both NAV Canada and the CANSCA, 
  rather than only to the purpose and intent of the CANSCA, I believe that the 
  preface is of no moment. Viewed as a whole, the motions judge's quoted comments 
  do not indicate that he confused the purpose of NAV Canada with that of the 
  CANSCA. </p>
<p>
  [56] I also do not agree that the motions judge's quoted comments indicate that 
  he was unaware of, or placed insufficient emphasis on, the commercialization 
  aspects of the CANSCA, or that he confused the purposes of the CANSCA and the 
  Aeronautics Act. The motions judge was clearly alive to the commercialization 
  aspects of the CANSCA. In summarizing NAV Canada's submissions before him, the 
  motions judge stated at para. 50: </p>
<p class="indent">
  NAV Canada submits that the more extended definition of the word "owner" 
  should be preferred as it gives effect to what NAV Canada submits is the object 
  and purpose of the [CANSCA] to enable NAV Canada to operate on a non-profit, 
  cost recovery basis and in order to do so, to have the option of proceeding 
  against either the operator or owner of an aircraft to collect fees for navigation 
  services. </p>
<p>
  [57] In my view, the motions judge was not required to further detail his understanding 
  of the commercialization aspects of the CANSCA. His failure to do so does not 
  indicate that he misunderstood those features of the CANSCA, or the purpose 
  of that Act in contrast to the inter-related purposes of the Aeronautics Act. 
  </p>
<p>
  [58] At its core, NAV Canada's real objection to the quoted comments by the 
  motions judge concerns his conclusion that the services provided by NAV Canada 
  are used by the operators of the aircraft "and/or persons having custody 
  and control of the aircraft and not by the financiers of the aircraft". 
  That conclusion, with which I agree, was based on the motions judge's consideration 
  of the navigation charges scheme under the CANSCA, the terms of s. 55(2) of 
  the CANSCA, s. 3(1) of the Aeronautics Act, and the definitions of "operator" 
  and "owner" set out in the CARs. I will address each of these factors 
  later in these reasons. </p>
<p>
  (3) Ordinary Meaning of "Owner" in Section 55</p>
<p>
  [59] There is no dispute that the unpaid charges owed to NAV Canada are for 
  "air navigation services" within the meaning of that term under s. 
  55 of the CANSCA, and that Canada 3000 and Royal were the "operators" 
  of the Aircraft. The issue, therefore, is whether the Lessors are "owners" 
  within the meaning of s. 55 so as to attract direct liability for these unpaid 
  charges.</p>
<p>
  (a) Legislative Definitions</p>
<p>
  [60] The words "owner" and "operator" are not defined in 
  s. 55(1) of the CANSCA or in s. 2(1), the general definition section of that 
  Act. The term "user", however, is defined in s. 2(1) as meaning "an 
  aircraft operator". In addition, and importantly, s. 2(2) of the CANSCA 
  provides: "Unless a contrary intention appears, words and expressions used 
  in this Act have the same meaning as in subsection 3(1) of the Aeronautics Act" 
  [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [61] Section 3(1) of the Aeronautics Act does not contain a definition of "owner" 
  or "operator". However, it defines "registered owner", in 
  respect of an aircraft, as: "the person to whom a certificate of registration 
  for the aircraft has been issued by the Minister under Part I or in respect 
  of whom the aircraft has been registered by the Minister under that Part."</p>
<p>
  [62] As well, s. 101.01(1) of the CARs defines the words "operator", 
  in respect of an aircraft, and "owner" as: </p>
<p class="indent">
  s.101.01(1) In these Regulations,</p>
<p class="center">.
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> "operator", in respect of an aircraft, means the 
  person that has possession of the aircraft as owner, lessee or otherwise;</p>
<p class="center">.
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> "owner", in respect of an aircraft, means the person 
  who has legal custody and control of the aircraft [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  It is common ground that, by virtue of ss. 202.15, 202.16 and 202.17 of the 
  CARs, an aircraft may only be registered in the Canadian Civil Aircraft Register 
  by the "owner" of the aircraft as that term is defined under s. 101.01(1) 
  of the CARs, that is, by the person having legal custody and control of the 
  aircraft.</p>
<p>
  [63] Finally, s. 55(2) of the CANSCA provides a specific definition of "owner" 
  for the purpose of s. 55(1) of that Act. That section provides that the word 
  "owner", "includes" four categories of persons. None of 
  those categories explicitly mentions the holders of legal title, lessors or 
  secured parties. Subparagraphs (b) to (d) of s. 55(2) concern persons "in 
  possession" of an aircraft under a conditional sale or hire-purchase agreement 
  (subparagraph (b)), as a chattel mortgagor under a chattel mortgage (subparagraph 
  (c)), or under a bona fide lease or agreement of hire (subparagraph (d)). There 
  is no suggestion that the Lessors fit within any of those categories. As well, 
  in connection with the first category set out in subparagraph s. 55(2)(a), which 
  concerns persons "in whose name the aircraft is registered", the parties 
  agree that the Aircraft were registered solely in the name of Canada 3000 under 
  the Aeronautics Act and the regulations made thereunder. The word "registered" 
  is not defined under the CANSCA. </p>
<p>
  [64] Against that backdrop of legislative definitions, NAV Canada argues that 
  the ordinary meaning of "owner" includes legal titleholders such as 
  the Lessors. It further asserts that the s. 55(2) definition of "owner" 
  does not displace or diminish the ordinary meaning of "owner" but, 
  instead, extends it to those categories of persons enumerated in s. 55(2). Thus, 
  NAV Canada maintains that the s. 55(2) definition of "owner" is expansive 
  rather than restrictive or exhaustive. </p>
<p>
  [65] NAV Canada makes several submissions in support of that argument. First, 
  it relies on a dictionary meaning of "owner" to suggest that the ordinary 
  meaning of that word contemplates legal titleholders. Second, it submits that 
  the use of the word "includes" in the English language version of 
  s. 55(2) is a strong indicator of Parlia-mentary intention that the definition 
  of "owner" in s. 55 is to be interpreted expansively. Third, it asserts 
  that the "shared meaning" rule of statutory interpretation for bilingual 
  statutes does not apply in this case to establish the intended meaning of "owner" 
  in s. 55. Fourth, it submits that the motions judge erred in interpreting s. 
  55(2) as if it were subject to the ejusdem generis principle of statutory construction.</p>
<p>
  (b) Dictionary Definitions of "Owner"</p>
<p>
  [66] The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles, 3rd ed. 
  (London: Clarendon Press, 1973) Vol. II defines "owner" as "one 
  who owns or holds something; one who has the rightful claim or title to a thing". 
  According to NAV Canada, that definition establishes that the ordinary meaning 
  of "owner" is a legal titleholder. I do not agree that this is the 
  only, or even the preferred, ordinary meaning of "owner". The word 
  "owner" is susceptible to various meanings, depending on the context 
  in which it is used.</p>
<p>
  [67] The dictionary definition of "owner" relied upon by NAV Canada 
  itself recognizes that something less than or different from legal title may 
  give rise to ownership status: one of the specified meanings of "owner" 
  under the definition is "one who&#133;holds something; one who has the 
  rightful claim&#133;to a thing". Black's Law Dictionary, 7th ed. defines 
  "owner" as "[o]ne who has the right to possess, use, and convey 
  something; a proprietor" and the verb "own" as "[t]o have 
  or possess as property; to have legal title to". In the same text, the 
  word "ownership" is defined as: "The collection of rights allowing 
  one to use and enjoy property; including the right to convey it to others. Ownership 
  implies the right to possess a thing, regardless of any actual or constructive 
  control." Thus, the ordinary dictionary meaning of "owner" encompasses 
  either the legal titleholder or the person having the right to use and possess 
  property, or both.</p>
<p>
  [68] Statutory interpretation is not based only on the wording of a challenged 
  statutory provision. Context is a controlling factor in the search for legislative 
  meaning: Rizzo at paras. 40-41 and Bell ExpressVu at para. 27. Moreover, the 
  courts have recognized that the legislative context in which the word "owner" 
  appears in a statute may signify an intention to give the word a meaning larger, 
  or different, than its ordinary meaning. See for example, Town of Springhill 
  v. McLeod, [1929] 60 N.S.R. 272 at 278 (N.S.S.C.) and Royal Bank v. Port Royal 
  Pulp and Paper Co., [1937] 4 D.L.R. 254 at 257 (N.B.C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [69] I conclude, therefore, that the ordinary meaning of "owner" can, 
  but need not, extend to legal titleholders. The meaning of "owner" 
  as employed in a statutory provision is context-specific.</p>
<p>
  (c) Implications of Use of the Word "includes" </p>
<p>
  [70] As I have said, NAV Canada does not contend that the Lessors fit within 
  any of the enumerated categories set out in the s. 55(2) definition of "owner". 
  Instead, it argues that the use of the word "includes" in the English 
  language version of s. 55(2) signifies that the categories of "owner[s]" 
  enumerated in s. 55(2) are not exhaustive. See for example, O. &amp; O. Contractors 
  Ltd. v. Bank of Nova Scotia (1965), 56 D.L.R. (2d) 90 (B.C.C.A.) and Ford Credit 
  Canada Ltd. v. Solis, 2003 ABCA 137 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [71] The motions judge concluded that the word "includes" can be used 
  in either an extended or restrictive sense. I agree. As noted by the motions 
  judge, support for that conclusion may be found in Dilworth v. Commissioner 
  of Stamps, [1899] A.C. 99 (P.C.) and R. v. Loblaw Groceterias Co. (Manitoba) 
  Ltd., [1961] S.C.R. 138. </p>
<p>
  [72] NAV Canada argues that those cases did not turn on the meaning ascribed 
  to the word "includes". In Dilworth, the statutory definition under 
  review contained language in addition to the word "includes", which 
  suggested that the contested definition was intended to be read exhaustively 
  and, in Loblaw Groceterias, the predecessor section to the applicable statutory 
  definition contained expansive language, the deletion of which by Parliament 
  suggested that the revised definition was intended to have an exhaustive meaning. 
  I agree that those features of the statutory provisions at issue in Dilworth 
  and Loblaw Groceterias influenced the resulting judicial interpretations of 
  the provisions. Nonetheless, both cases recognize that the word "includes" 
  may form part of either an exhaustive or a restrictive statutory definition 
  depending on the associated words used in the provision and the context of the 
  provision.</p>
<p>
  [73] NAV Canada also submits that Laidlaw v. Toronto (Metropolitan), [1978] 
  2 S.C.R. 736 and Nova v. Amoco Canada Petroleum Co., [1981] 2 S.C.R. 437 evidence 
  a more recent and consistent judicial trend to adopt an expansive meaning for 
  a word defined by reference to "includes". Those cases suggest that 
  the use of the word "includes" in a statutory definition is generally 
  intended to enlarge the ordinary meaning of the defined word, and that the use 
  of the word "means" generally signifies an intention to restrict the 
  scope of the defined word to that meaning identified in the statutory definition. 
  </p>
<p>
  [74] In both Laidlaw and Nova, however, the Supreme Court of Canada also confirmed 
  that regard must be had to the context of a challenged word or expression to 
  ascertain whether a particular or preferred interpretation of the word or expression 
  is intended: Laidlaw at 743-44; Nova at 460. The Dilworth and Loblaw Groceterias 
  cases were not referenced in the Laidlaw and Nova cases. Moreover, in National 
  Bank of Greece (Canada) v. Katsikonouris, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1029, also relied 
  upon by NAV Canada, a majority of the Supreme Court at paras. 14-16 regarded 
  the use of the word "including" in a standard mortgage coverage clause 
  in a fire insurance policy as an indicator of an intention that the clause be 
  interpreted expansively. In that case, however, the court also had regard to 
  the history of the clause as an aid to ascertaining its meaning. These cases 
  illustrate that in the search for legislative meaning, a contextual and purposive 
  analysis of the provision in which a challenged word appears "trumps" 
  the application of other interpretive rules and principles. See also, R. Sullivan, 
  Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, 4th ed. (Markham: Butterworths, 
  2002) at 51-55. In my view, therefore, Laidlaw and Nova should not be read as 
  standing for the proposition that the use of the word "includes" in 
  a statutory provision invariably signals an intention to expand the meaning 
  of the defined word or expression. </p>
<p>
  [75] NAV Canada further submits that it is inappropriate to read into s. 55(2) 
  the word "means" when Parliament elected to use only the word "includes" 
  and not the word "means" or the phrase "means and includes". 
  It correctly points out that in Campbell Soup Co. Ltd. v. Farm Products Marketing 
  Board (1977), 10 O.R. (2d) 405 (H.C.J.), aff'd. (1977), 16 O.R. (2d) 256 (C.A.), 
  Morden J., as he then was, observed that statutory definitions using both "means" 
  and "includes" should be avoided because use of that drafting technique 
  raises doubt as to whether the defined term is intended to be restrictive or 
  expansive.</p>
<p> [76] Morden J.'s cautionary words in Campbell Soup were not heeded in the 
  instance of the CANSCA. The English language version of the general definition 
  section of the Act (s. 2(1)), contains numerous instances of words and phrases 
  defined to "mean" enumerated things.<a name="r8"></a><a href="#8">[8]</a> It 
  also contains terms defined by use of both "means" and "includes".<a name="r9"></a><a href="#9">[9]</a> 
  With one exception, which is irrelevant to the interpretation of s. 55, all 
  definitions in the English language version of s. 2(1) use the word "means" 
  and no term is defined solely in connection with use of the word "includes". 
  The same approach is reflected in s. 73(1) of the CANSCA, the definition section 
  which concerns services to humanitarian or emergency flights. </p>
<p>
  [77] Thus, it can be argued that the use of the word "includes" in 
  the English language version of s. 55(2) of the CANSCA is atypical of the drafting 
  approach to other interpretation provisions found in the Act, with the result 
  that the choice of the word "includes", instead of "means" 
  or "means and includes", is purposive, signalling a deliberate choice 
  by Parliament to avoid an exhaustive interpretation of "owner" for 
  the purpose of s. 55(1). This factor militates in favour of the interpretation 
  of s. 55(2) urged by NAV Canada. However, significantly, the court in Campbell 
  Soup stressed that the context in which a word appears in a statute may displace 
  the basic meaning of the word in the enactment and common parlance regardless 
  of the use of the phrase "means and includes". As well, regard must 
  be had to the words employed in the French language version of the provision 
  in issue.</p>
<p>
  (d) Implications of Use of the Word "s'entend"</p>
<p> [78] The French language version of s. 55(2) uses the word "s'entend" in place 
  of the word "includes". The Lessors argue that the English translation of the 
  word "s'entend" is "means" and, given the use of "s'entend" in the French language 
  version of s. 55(2), it is clear from that version that the definition of "owner" 
  in s. 55(2) is exhaustive: Harrap's New Standard French and English Dictionary 
  (London: Harrap, 1972) s.v. entendre. See also Collins Unabridged French-English, 
  English-French Dictionary, 6th ed. (New York: Harper Collins, 2002) s.v. entendre. 
  They also rely for the meaning of "s'entend" on the recent decision of the Superior 
  Court of Quebec in NAV Canada v. Wilmington Trust Co., [2000] J.Q. no. 5007 
  (S.C.) ("Inter-Canadien")<a name="r10"></a><a href="#10">[10]</a> , in which 
  many of the matters at issue in these proceedings were considered.</p>
<p>
  [79] In Inter-Canadien, Tremblay J. noted at paras. 128-29 that the French language 
  version of s. 55(2) of the CANSCA uses the word "propri&eacute;taire" 
  for the word "owner" and the word "l'usager" for the word 
  "operator", and stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In French, the word "propri&eacute;taire" [owner] is defined as a 
  word that "means" a list which then follows, while in English, the 
  word "owner" is defined as a word that "includes" such and 
  such; therefore, the English definition is a much broader definition, such that 
  the definition refers not only to the "ordinary" meaning of the word 
  "owner", but also to the list which follows the word "includes".</p>
<p class="indent"> If one keeps to the French definition of the word "owner" which 
  "means" such and such a thing, the word owner is therefore limited to the registered 
  owner [translated].</p>
<p>
  [80] Justice Tremblay thus accepted that the word "s'entend" translates 
  in English as "means", that the French language version of s. 55(2) 
  of the CANSCA defines "owner" restrictively and, consequently, that 
  the two official language versions of s. 55(2) are capable of different interpretations. 
  However, he rejected the restrictive interpretation of s. 55(2) suggested by 
  the French language version in favour of the expansive inter-pretation which, 
  he concluded, is suggested by the terminology of the English language version. 
  </p>
<p> [81] I agree with the Lessors' submission that the word "s'entend" as employed 
  in s. 55(2) of the CANSCA translates in English as "means". That interpretation 
  conforms with the ordinary meaning of "s'entend" according to dictionary definitions 
  and the decision in Inter-Canadien. It is also consistent with the French language 
  version of s. 2(1) of the CANSCA, which defines several words or phrases by 
  use of the term "s'entend" while the corresponding definitions of the same words 
  or phrases in the English language version of that provision employ the word 
  "means".<a name="r11"></a><a href="#11">[11]</a> It is also clear, however, 
  that the purpose and intent of the statutory provision in which "s'entend" is 
  used must be examined before determining whether an expansive interpretation 
  of the provision may nonetheless be appropriate.</p>
<p> (e) Shared Meaning Rule for the Interpretation of Bilingual Statutes</p>
<p>
  [82] The motions judge rejected the Lessors' submission that the application 
  of the "shared meaning" rule for the interpretation of bilingual statutes 
  is determinative of the meaning of s. 55(2) of the CANSCA. In my view, he was 
  correct to do so. Application of the shared meaning rule does not conclusively 
  establish the meaning of s. 55(2). It does yield, however, a presumptive meaning 
  of s. 55(2) that must be tested against the purpose, context and intent of s. 
  55 as a whole.</p>
<p>
  [83] Where two versions of a bilingual statute appear to express different things, 
  the shared meaning rule for the interpretation of bilingual statutes requires 
  that the meaning that is shared by both versions ought to be adopted: Sullivan, 
  supra, at 80. There are many examples of judicial reliance on the shared meaning 
  rule to resolve ambiguities in bilingual statutes. See for example, Schreiber 
  v. Canada (Attorney General) 2002 SCC 62 at para. 56 and R. v. Mac, [2002] 1 
  S.C.R. 856 at paras. 5-6. See also Sullivan at 81-86. The rule is not absolute, 
  however, and can be rejected if the meaning shared between the two statutory 
  versions is contrary to Parliament's intention or the purpose or objects of 
  the enactment: Dor&eacute; v. Verdun (City), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 862 at para. 25; 
  Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038 at paras. 73-76, 
  Lamer J., dissenting in part; R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265 at para. 43; 
  R. v. Compagnie Immobili&egrave;re BCN Lt&eacute;e, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 865 at 871-72 
  and 874-75; Flota Cubana de Pesca v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 
  [1998] 2 F.C. 303 at paras. 40-41 (C.A.); P.-A. C&ocirc;t&eacute; in The Interpretation 
  of Legislation in Canada, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2000) at 328-29; and Sullivan 
  at 87.</p>
<p>
  [84] In this case, in my view, "s'entend" in the French language version 
  of s. 55(2) translates in English as "means" and is used in a restrictive 
  sense, whereas the English language version of s. 55(2) connotes either an expansive 
  or a restrictive meaning. Thus, the English and French language versions of 
  s. 55(2) could give rise to different interpretations. As the word "includes" 
  can be used in either a restrictive or extended sense, the shared meaning between 
  the English and French language versions of s. 55(2) is a restrictive meaning. 
  That restrictive meaning must be tested against the context and purpose of s. 
  55 and the intention of Parliament to determine if it contradicts or under-mines 
  the purpose of s. 55. In my view, for the reasons given below, a contextual 
  and purposive analysis of s. 55 confirms that the s. 55(2) definition of "owner" 
  is intended to be restrictive. </p>
<p>
  (f) Ejusdem Generis Principle</p>
<p>
  [85] NAV Canada also asserts that in interpreting "owner" restrictively, 
  the motions judge erred by treating the definition of "owner" in s. 
  55(2) as if it were subject to the principle of ejusdem generis. According to 
  that principle, when interpreting a clause that sets out a list of specific 
  words followed by a general term, the general term should be limited to the 
  genus of the narrow enumeration that precedes it. For the principle to apply, 
  the general words must follow, rather than precede, the enumeration of specific 
  words: National Bank of Greece, supra, at para. 11. </p>
<p>
  [86] I do not agree that the motions judge applied the principle of ejusdem 
  generis in his analysis of s. 55(2). The motions judge sought to ascertain the 
  intended meaning of "owner" by considering the entire context of s. 
  55(2), including the terminology of both the English and French language versions 
  of the provision. His purpose was to determine the meaning of the words used 
  to introduce the categories of "owner[s]" enumerated in s. 55(2), 
  as well as the relationship between the categories so enumerated and the general 
  words which preceded them. That is exactly what he should have done. As emphasized 
  by Sullivan at 181, the important factor is not word order, but the meaning 
  of the words used to introduce the list of specific terms and to link them to 
  the general category, and the relationship between the specifics listed and 
  the general category. In any event, even if the ejusdem generis principle had 
  been applied by the motions judge, it is merely the application of a contextual 
  principle and is not determinative of the intention of Parliament: Sullivan 
  at 181-82. It is apparent from the motions judge's reasons for the May 7, 2002 
  Order that his analysis of s. 55 of the CANSCA was not limited to consideration 
  of the structure and ordering of the words used in s. 55(2).</p>
<p>
  (4) Legislative Context and History of Section 55</p>
<p>
  [87] NAV Canada asserts that the motions judge erred in the following ways in 
  inter-preting s. 55: (i) in considering provisions of the CANSCA concerned with 
  "users" of the civil air navigation system; (ii) in considering provisions 
  of the CARs, subordinate legislation passed under the Aeronautics Act; (iii) 
  in failing to assign a purposive legislative intention to a difference in language 
  between s. 55(1) of the CANSCA and s. 4.4(5) of the Aeronautics Act; and (iv) 
  in failing to accord a meaning to s. 55 consistent with the commercial expectations 
  of the parties. In considering these submissions, it is useful to first address 
  the navigation charges schemes under the CANSCA and the Aeronautics Act. </p>
<p>
  (a) Charges Scheme Under the CANSCA</p>
<p>
  [88] Section 55 of the CANSCA is contained in Part III of that Act, which is 
  concerned with charges for air navigation services. Subject to certain restrictions 
  set out in ss. 32(2) and (5) of the CANSCA, NAV Canada is authorized under Part 
  III to impose charges on a "user" for the availability or provision 
  of air navigation services (s. 32(1)). As I have mentioned, the word "user" 
  is defined in s. 2(1) of the CANSCA as "an aircraft operator". Thus, 
  NAV Canada's authority to impose charges for its services extends only to aircraft 
  operators, in this case, the Canada 3000 Companies. Further, a charge imposed 
  by NAV Canada on a user under s. 32(1) is deemed by s. 32(4) of the CANSCA to 
  be "in respect of aircraft operated by that user".</p>
<p>
  [89] Section 34(1) of the CANSCA authorizes NAV Canada to establish new or revised 
  charges for air navigation services. That power, however, is subject to several 
  important constraints: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) in establishing new or revised charges, NAV Canada must adhere to a series 
  of statutory charging principles set out in s. 35(1) of the CANSCA;</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) NAV Canada is required to operate on a cost recovery basis 
  (ss. 35(5) and (6));</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) notice of any proposal by NAV Canada to establish new 
  or revised charges must be provided to specific representative organizations 
  of users and every user and "other person[s]" as notify NAV Canada of their 
  desire to receive such notices (s. 36);</p>
<p class="indent"> (iv) similarly, with the exception of new or revised charges 
  proposed by NAV Canada and approved under s. 39 by the Minister of Transport 
  within two years of the date of the transfer to NAV Canada of the Crown's civil 
  air navigation assets (as contemplated under s. 7 of the CANSCA), NAV Canada 
  is obliged under s. 37 of the CANSCA to announce any proposed new or revised 
  charges prior to implementing same. Copies of such announcements must be furnished 
  by NAV Canada to the same persons who are entitled, and every user and other 
  person who seek, to receive notices or announcements under the Act. Such announcements 
  must also be posted on the Internet (s. 37(4));</p>
<p class="indent"> (v) s. 42 provides a right of appeal to the Canadian Transportation 
  Agency, on specific grounds and within a fixed time, concerning charges imposed 
  by NAV Canada, unless the charges have been approved earlier by the Minister 
  of Transport under s. 39 of the CANSCA.<a name="r12"></a><a href="#12">[12]</a> 
  The appeal right afforded by s. 42 is available only to users, groups of users 
  or repre-sentative organizations of users; other interested persons who receive 
  notice or an announcement from NAV Canada concerning a proposal to establish 
  new or revised charges have no statutory standing to appeal under s. 42 (s. 
  44);</p>
<p class="indent"> (vi) the Canadian Transportation Agency is authorized, in specific 
  circumstances, to order the cancellation of new or revised charges that are 
  the subject of an appeal and to direct a refund of the charges, or the amount 
  in excess of the charges allowed on appeal, to each user who paid them (s. 51); 
  and </p>
<p class="indent"> (vii) no appeal lies from the decision of the Canadian Transportation 
  Agency on a charges appeal (s. 53).</p>
<p>
  [90] In the context of this charges scheme, s. 55(1) of the CANSCA imposes joint 
  and several liability on the "owner and operator of an aircraft" for 
  the payment of any navi-gation charges imposed by NAV Canada.</p>
<p>
  (b) Charges Scheme Under the Aeronautics Act</p>
<p>
  [91] Section 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act authorizes the Governor in Council or, 
  in specific circumstances, the applicable Minister of the Crown with the authority 
  of the Governor in Council, to make regulations imposing navigation charges. 
  Section 4.4 does not expressly restrict the imposition of charges to "users" 
  of aircraft. Section 4.4(5) provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  4.4(5) If a charge is imposed in respect of an aircraft under this section, 
  both the registered owner and the operator of the aircraft are jointly and severally, 
  or solidarily, liable for pay-ment of the charge [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="indent">Thus, the joint and several liability provision of the Aeronautics 
  Act extends to "registered owner[s]" and "operator[s]" of the aircraft in respect 
  of which a navigation charge is imposed. </p>
<p>
  [92] In contrast, s. 55(1) of the CANSCA imposes joint and several liability 
  upon the "owner and operator" of an aircraft and s. 55(2) provides 
  a specific definition of "owner". Subparagraph 55(2)(a) establishes 
  that "the person in whose name the aircraft is registered" is an "owner" 
  for the purpose of s. 55(1).</p>
<p>
  [93] The Aeronautics Act also provides for the recovery of charges imposed under 
  s. 4.4 of that Act. Section 4.4(4) reads: </p>
<p class="indent"> 4.4(4) All charges imposed under this section and interest 
  payable thereon constitute a debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada and 
  may be recovered as such in any court of competent jurisdiction. <a name="r13"></a><a href="#13">[13]</a> 
</p>
<p>
  [94] As well, under s. 155(1) of the Financial Administration Act, R.S.C. 1985, 
  c. F-11, where any person is indebted to the Crown, the appropriate Minister 
  of the Crown responsible for the recovery or collection of the debt may "authorize 
  the retention of the amount of the indebtedness by way of deduction from or 
  set-off against any sum of money that may be due or payable" by the Crown 
  to the person or the estate of the person indebted to the Crown. </p>
<p>
  [95] In view of those provisions, NAV Canada argues in its factum in these proceedings: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In contrast to s. 4.4(5) of the Aeronautics Act, s. 55 of [the] CANSCA does 
  not refer merely to "registered owner" but adopts [an] expansive definition 
  of owner&#133;incorporating the usual and ordinary meaning of owner in the sense 
  of the person holding legal title.</p>
<p class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> [T]he change in wording of the provisions imposing liability 
  to pay air navigation charges as reflected in s. 55, was intended to broaden 
  NAV Canada's collection rights to offset the loss of the collection power previously 
  enjoyed by the Minister of [Transport] by virtue of the set-off provisions of 
  the Financial Administration Act.</p>
<p>
  (c) Provisions of the CANSCA Concerning "Users" </p>
<p>
  [96] NAV Canada's argument that the motions judge erred in considering provisions 
  of the CANSCA concerning "users" must be placed in context. The motions 
  judge recognized that legislative history, although not determinative of Parliament's 
  intention regarding a statutory enactment, is a proper and useful aid to ascertaining 
  the purpose and meaning of an enactment: C.U.P.E., supra, at para. 54 and Ulybel 
  Enterprises, supra, at paras. 33-35. In that context, the motions judge said 
  at para. 52 of his reasons for the May 7, 2002 Order: </p>
<p class="indent">
  To the extent that the legislative history is of assistance to the court, it 
  is significant in my view that the joint and several liability for navigation 
  charges under the Aeronautics Act was imposed only upon the registered owner 
  and operators of the aircraft. There is nothing in the material before this 
  court or in the [CANSCA] itself to support any intention on the part of Parliament 
  to expand the liability for navigation charges to persons who are not either 
  registered owners or operators of the aircraft. It is also significant that 
  section 101.01(1) of the [CARs] defines "owner" in respect of an aircraft 
  as "the person who has legal custody and control of the aircraft". 
  I am accordingly of the view that consideration of the legislative history of 
  the [CANSCA] and a consideration of the provisions of related legislation, on 
  balance, supports the view that the word "owner" in the [CANSCA] should 
  not be interpreted to include persons who do not have custody or control of 
  the aircraft, do not operate the aircraft, and do not make use of the air navigation 
  services in respect of which the navigation charges are levied.</p>
<p>
  [97] After next reviewing part of the Lessors' submissions concerning the meaning 
  of s. 55(2) and the charges scheme set out in the CANSCA, the motions judge 
  stated that NAV Canada's navigation services "are obviously used by the 
  operators of the aircraft and/or persons having custody and control of the aircraft". 
  The financiers of aircraft, he concluded, do not use or benefit from such navigation 
  services and do not enjoy notice and appeal rights concerning navigation charges.</p>
<p>
  [98] I do not accept NAV Canada's argument that the motions judge erred in considering 
  provisions of the CANSCA concerned with "users" of the services provided 
  by NAV Canada. The charges scheme in the CANSCA is a user-pay scheme. Charges 
  for the availability or provision of air navigation services may be imposed 
  by NAV Canada under s. 32 of the CANSCA only on "users", that is, 
  on aircraft operators. The Lessors did not operate the Aircraft and, therefore, 
  were not "users" under the CANSCA. The concept of "users" 
  of navigation services permeates the entire charges scheme under the CANSCA. 
  To place s. 55 in its proper context within that scheme, the underlying nature 
  and focus of the scheme is an important consideration. </p>
<p> [99] Moreover, in my view, the motions judge's findings that the Lessors do 
  not use and do not receive the benefit of the services provided by NAV Canada 
  were amply supported by the record before him. That record established that 
  NAV Canada's services were provided and invoiced in the normal course of business 
  to the operators of aircraft, in this case, the Canada 3000 Companies. Although 
  the Lessors derived a stream of rental income from the commercial use of the 
  Aircraft prior to the termination of the Aircraft leases and the leases contemplated 
  the use of the Aircraft by Canada 3000, the obligation under the leases to make 
  rental payments was not dependant on the actual use of the Aircraft. In addition, 
  the Lessors did not contract with NAV Canada for the provision of navigation 
  services and, in the normal course, the Lessors did not receive notice of invoices 
  and were not billed for navigation charges.<a name="r14"></a><a href="#14">[14]</a> 
  In that context, in my view, the motions judge was correct to conclude that 
  the Lessors do not make use of and do not derive benefit from navigation services 
  furnished by NAV Canada.</p>
<p>
  [100] As well, and importantly, the Lessors are not the beneficiaries of many 
  of the statutory protections under the CANSCA's charges scheme. The notice, 
  announcement and appeal provisions of the CANSCA are designed to protect against 
  the imposition of improper or arbitrary charges by NAV Canada. These provisions 
  are predominately user-oriented. Persons other than users, such as the Lessors, 
  are not automatically entitled to receipt of notices and announcements concerning 
  proposed new or revised navigation charges and they have no statutory standing 
  to appeal such changes in charges to the Canadian Transportation Agency. There 
  is also no statutory requirement under the CANSCA for representation on NAV 
  Canada's board of directors of aircraft lessors or financiers. See in that connection, 
  Senate Debates (10 June 1996) at 590 (Hon. Raymond J. Perrault). </p>
<p>
  [101] As a result of these factors, lessors of aircraft, in contrast to aircraft 
  operators, have no direct legal ability to check or to challenge the exercise 
  by NAV Canada of its monopolistic powers. In my view, the charges scheme of 
  the CANSCA does not protect aircraft lessors and secured creditors from the 
  possible imposition by NAV Canada of improper or arbitrary navigation charges 
  precisely because it is not envisaged that such persons will have any liability 
  for such charges. Were it otherwise, I believe that the interests of such lessors 
  and secured creditors would be enveloped under the same protective statutory 
  umbrella that benefits users of NAV Canada's services.</p>
<p>
  (d) Provisions of the CARs</p>
<p>
  [102] In the circumstances of this case, I believe that it was both appropriate 
  and necessary for the motions judge to have regard to regulations under the 
  Aeronautics Act when interpreting s. 55 of the CANSCA. Although such regulations 
  are subordinate legislation promulgated under the Aeronautics Act rather than 
  under the CANSCA, as I have said, the CANSCA and the Aeronautics Act are inter-related 
  parts of a broader regulatory framework. The contextual and purposive approach 
  to statutory interpretation allows, and in some cases may require, reference 
  to regulations as an aid to interpreting a statutory enactment. In my view, 
  this is such a case. </p>
<p>
  [103] As Sullivan observes at p. 282, the conventional view is that: "Because 
  regulations are a subordinate form of legislation, usually made after the enabling 
  Act has been passed, they have limited value in interpreting provisions of the 
  Act." The CARs were promulgated under the Aeronautics Act on October 10, 
  1996, shortly after the CANSCA became effective on June 20, 1996. The anticipated 
  role of the CARs was repeatedly emphasized in the debates in the House of Commons 
  and the Senate concerning Bill C-20 as an intended and important link between 
  the Aeronautics Act and the CANSCA. In this case, consideration of the CARs 
  is not undertaken for guidance on the meaning of words in the enactment under 
  which the CARs were made but, rather, for guidance on the meaning of words in 
  an associated statute, which Parliament determined should be linked to, and 
  promulgated almost contemporaneously with, the CARs. Accordingly, the case at 
  bar is distinguishable from cases where the words of a statutory enactment are 
  sought to be construed by reference to regulations made under the powers contained 
  in the same enactment. </p>
<p>
  [104] This court has recognized that where regulations are closely intertwined 
  with a statute, or were enacted contemporaneously with a statute under review 
  by the court, the regulations may be useful interpretive tools: Monsanto Canada 
  Inc. v. Ontario (Superintendent of Financial Services) (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 
  305 at paras. 62-64, (C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada 
  granted [2003] S.C.C.A. No. 42. See also Hanlon v. The Law Society, [1981] A.C. 
  124 (H.L.); Garland v. Canada (Employ-ment and Immigration Commission), [1985] 
  2 F.C. 508 (C.A.); and Crupi v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission), 
  [1986] 3 F.C. 3 (C.A.).</p>

<p>
  [105] A review of the CARs and their predecessor regulations, the Air Regulations, 
  1978, C.R.C., c. 2 (the "Air Regulations") confirms that s. 55(2) 
  of the CANSCA derived from the definition of "owner" set out in s. 
  101 of the Air Regulations. That genesis of s. 55(2) is not disputed by NAV 
  Canada. Section 101 of the Air Regulations also defined "ownership" 
  as "having legal custody and control of an aircraft". </p>
<p>
  [106] The Air Regulations were in force at the time that NAV Canada was established. 
  Section 55(2) of the CANSCA imported the s. 101 definition of "owner" 
  under the Air Regulations in verbatim language. Thereafter, the CARs came into 
  force and the Air Regulations were repealed. Under the CARs, the definition 
  of "owner" imports the language of "legal custody and control" 
  used in the s. 101 definition of "ownership" under the Air Regulations. 
  In my view, it was unnecessary to directly import the "ownership" 
  definition from the Air Regulations into s. 55 of the CANSCA, because that "ownership" 
  definition was already reflected in the CARs, which implicitly are linked to 
  the CANSCA. </p>
<p>
  [107] Consequently, it was appropriate for the motions judge to examine the 
  CARs and their predecessor regulations as part of the legislative evolution 
  and context of s. 55(2) when determining the meaning of that provision. That 
  examination establishes that the categories of "owner[s]" enumerated 
  in s. 55(2) are concerned with persons having legal custody and control or who 
  are otherwise in possession of an aircraft. </p>
<p>
  (e) Comparison of the Language of Section 4.4(5) of the</p>
<p>
  Aeronautics Act and Section 55(1) of the CANSCA</p>
<p>
  [108] I agree with NAV Canada that a comparison of the language of s. 55(1) 
  of the CANSCA and s. 4.4(5) of the Aeronautics Act is also relevant to the interpretation 
  of the word "owner" in s. 55 of the former Act. The key difference 
  between the liability sections in the two enactments is the absence in s. 55(1) 
  of the CANSCA and the presence in s. 4.4(5) of the Aeronautics Act of the adjective 
  "registered" before the word "owner". Given that difference 
  in language, NAV Canada argues that Parliament sought to remove the concept 
  of "registered owner" from the CANSCA and to introduce in its stead 
  a concept of "owner" which encompasses persons in addition to those 
  persons having legal custody and control or who are otherwise in possession 
  of an aircraft. I disagree. </p>
<p>
  [109] The legislative history of the term "registered owner" under 
  the Aeronautics Act is especially relevant in this connection. Canadian aeronautics 
  legislation underwent comprehensive reform in 1985 consequent upon the recommendations 
  of the Dubin Commission of Inquiry on Aviation Safety (Ottawa: Supply and Services 
  Canada, 1981). Bill C-36, the legislative bill which led to the current Aeronautics 
  Act, was the product of extensive consultations with the aviation community, 
  the public, and special interest groups concerning a new legislative framework 
  for the safety of aviation in Canada and the growth of the aviation sector: 
  House of Commons Debates (15 April 1985) at 3728-30 (Hon. Donald Mazankowski). 
  </p>
<p>
  [110] The s. 3(1) definition of "registered owner" under the Aeronautics 
  Act was introduced by amendment to Bill C-36 during second reading of that Bill 
  in the House of Commons. Prior to that, when Bill C-36 was considered by the 
  Standing Senate Committee on Transport, various industry and pilots organizations 
  urged amendment of the concept of "owner" under the Bill expressly 
  to restrict its application to those persons in whose name aircraft were registered 
  and, thus, to exclude from the term "owner" legal titleholders to 
  aircraft and financiers of aircraft where those persons were not also the registered 
  owners of the aircraft. See for example, Proceedings of the Standing Senate 
  Committee on Transport (7 May 1985) at 1045 and Appendix TRPT-3 thereto at 9A:3 
  and 9A:8. On second reading of Bill C-36 in the House of Commons, a more expansive 
  definition of "owner" was deleted from the Bill and the restricted 
  definition of "registered owner" was substituted in its place. The 
  purpose of those amendments was described by the parliamentary secretary to 
  the then Minister of Transport: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [W]ith the same aim of first meeting the Air Transport Association's concerns 
  with regard to the definition of "owner", and to meet the intent of 
  [the Standing Committee on Transport], we have put forward a basic amendment 
  and amendments that give effect as in other parts of the Bill.</p>
<p class="indent"> The use of the term "registered owner" would have the effect 
  of limiting the provisions to those who actually have control of the aircraft. 
  Prior to the amendment it might have ex-tended to those who have a security 
  or other financial interest&#133;I can only repeat that it was an attempt to 
  meet the intent of the committee and the intent of the Act itself [emphasis 
  added]. (House of Commons Debates (20 June 1985) at 6065-66 (Hon. J.M. Forrestall).</p>
<p>
  [111] The intention to so limit the scope of the concept of "owner" 
  was carried forward in s. 4.4(5), the joint and several liability provision 
  of the Aeronautics Act, by the reference in that section to "the registered 
  owner and the operator of the aircraft" [emphasis added]. That language 
  confirms that liability under s. 4.4(5) of the Aeronautics Act does not extend 
  to legal titleholders to aircraft or to persons having a security interest in 
  aircraft. The issue, then, is whether the absence of the word "registered" 
  in s. 55(1) of the CANSCA evidences a clear Parliamentary intention that the 
  scope of liability under that provision be enlarged from the scope of the liability 
  provision set out in s. 4.4(5) of the Aeronautics Act. I conclude that it does 
  not.</p>
<p>
  [112] Section 55(1) must be read together with s. 55(2). Subparagraph 55(2)(a) 
  incorporates the concept of aircraft registration into the definition of "owner". 
  I believe that the inclusion of this concept in subparagraph 55(2)(a) infuses 
  the interpretation of s. 55 with the meaning assigned to "registered owner" 
  under the Aeronautics Act and the term "owner" under the CARs. Stated 
  simply, it was unnecessary for Parliament to repeat the word "registered" 
  in s. 55(1) when the registration concept was expressly included in s. 55(2) 
  and when the CARs were designed as important related, albeit subordinate, legislation. 
  In that sense, the change in wording was deliberate and purposive and the meaning 
  of "owner" under the scheme of the Aeronautics Act was imported into 
  the CANSCA. In my view, Parliament clearly intended that the meaning of s. 55(1) 
  be determined with reference to the Aeronautics Act and the aircraft registration 
  regime effected by that Act. The legislative draftsman's choice to achieve that 
  objective by structuring s. 55 in two parts and including a reference to the 
  concept of aircraft registration in only the second part of the provision (s. 
  55(2)(a)), does not disprove that intention but simply reflects one method of 
  realizing it.</p>
<p>
  [113] In addition, as observed by Iacobucci J. in Bell ExpressVu at para. 27: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where the provision under consideration is found in an Act that is itself a 
  component of a larger statutory scheme, the surroundings that colour the words 
  and the scheme of the Act are more expansive. In such an instance, the application 
  of Driedger's principle gives rise to what was described in R. v. Ulybel Enterprises 
  Ltd.&#133;at para. 52, as "the principle of interpretation that presumes 
  a harmony, coherence, and consistency between statutes dealing with the same 
  subject matter" [citations omitted and emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [114] The CANSCA contains no express statutory indication that Parliament intended, 
  by the language of s. 55(1), to effect a fundamental change to the scope of 
  the joint and several liability provision contained in s. 4.4(5) of the Aeronautics 
  Act. To the contrary, I think that the combined effect of ss. 55(1) and (2) 
  of the CANSCA is to preserve the concepts of "owner" and "ownership" 
  articulated under the Aeronautics Act and the regulations made thereunder. I 
  therefore agree with the motions judge's conclusion that the word "owner" 
  in s. 55 of the CANSCA is concerned with persons who have legal custody and 
  control, or who are otherwise in possession, of aircraft. </p>
<p>
  [115] I would also reject NAV Canada's argument that, in contrast to the Crown's 
  collection rights for navigation charges under the Aeronautics Act, the absence 
  in the CANSCA of a right of set-off to aid collection efforts signifies a Parliamentary 
  intention that s. 55(1) be interpreted expansively. </p>
<p>
  [116] I agree with the Lessors' submission that NAV Canada enjoys a panoply 
  of remedies if an aircraft operator, such as a major airline, fails to pay navigation 
  charges when due. As I will discuss next in these reasons, it is entitled to 
  apply to the court under s. 56 of the CANSCA to seize and detain the aircraft 
  used by a defaulting airline until charges owed are fully paid or security is 
  posted therefor. It is also entitled to seek recovery of the debt owed pursuant 
  to civil proceedings in the courts. As well, as a matter of standard commercial 
  practice, it is free to demand security from the users of its services as a 
  condition of the provision of services, or to introduce and enforce rigorous 
  credit policies. Given NAV Canada's monopoly on the provision of civil air navigation 
  services, the impact of the threat or the implementation of such measures should 
  not be underestimated. As a result, the fact that NAV Canada does not also enjoy 
  a statutory set-off right similar to the right conferred on the Crown under 
  the Financial Administration Act cannot control the interpretation of the reach 
  of s. 55(1) of the CANSCA. </p>
<p>
  (f) Commercial Expectations of the Parties</p>
<p>
  [117] Finally, NAV Canada argues that the motions judge failed to accord ss. 
  55 and 56 of the CANSCA a meaning consistent with the commercial expectations 
  of the parties. It points to provisions of the Aircraft leases which obliged 
  Canada 3000 to pay airport and navigation charges, to provide security deposits 
  therefor, and to indemnify the Lessors in the event of the non-payment of such 
  charges or the seizure of the Aircraft consequent upon such non-payment, and 
  argues that those provisions evidence an acknowledgement or expectation by the 
  Lessors of potential liability for navigation charges. This argument can be 
  dealt with summarily. The parties' respective understanding of the import of 
  ss. 55 and 56 of the CANSCA does not establish Parliamentary intention concerning 
  the meaning of those provisions or the scope of the remedies actually provided 
  thereunder. Even if proven, the fact that the Lessors may have envisaged potential 
  liability under ss. 55 or 56 of the CANSCA does not control legislative meaning.</p>
<p>
  (5) Conclusion Concerning Purpose and Meaning of Section 55</p>
<p>
  [118] Given the legislative framework and the purpose of the CANSCA, the language 
  of s. 55, the fact that the meaning of the word "owner" is context-specific, 
  and the legislative context and history of s. 55 itself, I conclude that the 
  purpose of s. 55(1) is to provide a form of statutory protection to NAV Canada 
  for the collection of those civil air navigation charges from time to time owed 
  to it. It is not intended to assure or guarantee payment of those charges by 
  extending liability for payment of them to the legal title-holders to aircraft, 
  such as the Lessors. Rather, s. 55 identifies two broad categories of persons 
  who will attract status as "owners" under s. 55(1) for the purpose 
  of liability for navigation charges: persons having legal custody and control 
  and persons otherwise in possession of aircraft. Restricting liability under 
  s. 55(1) to those persons is consistent with the legislative context, legislative 
  history and objects of s. 55, the charges scheme under Part III of the CANSCA, 
  and the meaning of "owner" in the aviation context. Accordingly, I 
  would dismiss NAV Canada's appeal concerning s. 55 of the CANSCA. </p>
<p>
  (6) Position of the Sub-lessors</p>
<p>
  [119] Mention should also be made of one additional issue concerning NAV Canada's 
  claims under s. 55 of the CANSCA. The respondents Ansett Worldwide Aviation, 
  U.S.A. and MSA V leased three Aircraft to Canada 3000, two of which, in turn, 
  had been leased by those respondents from other persons under head leases. One 
  of the issues raised concerns whether these respondents are directly liable 
  for unpaid navigation charges under s. 55 of the CANSCA. The motions judge held 
  that the liability of these respon-dents need not be determined by him based 
  on his conclusion that the Lessors of the Aircraft are not "owner[s]" 
  of the Aircraft for the purpose of s. 55 of the CANSCA. That conclusion, with 
  which I agree for the reasons given, is dispositive of NAV Canada's claim under 
  s. 55 of the CANSCA against the two sub-lessor respondents. </p>
<p>
  C. Seizure and Detention Claims</p>
<p>
  (1) Statutory Provisions</p>
<p>
  [120] The following statutory provisions are relevant to the Authorities' seizure 
  and detention claims: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) The Airports Act, ss. 9 and 10: </p>
<p class="indent">
  9.(1) Where the amount of any landing fees, general terminal fees or other charges 
  related to the use of an airport, and interest thereon, set by a designated 
  airport authority in respect of an airport operated by the authority has not 
  been paid, the authority may, in addition to any other remedy available for 
  the collection of the amount and whether or not a judgment for the collection 
  of the amount has been obtained, on application to the superior court of the 
  province in which any aircraft owned or operated by the person liable to pay 
  the amount is situated, obtain an order of the court, issued on such terms as 
  the court considers necessary, authorizing the authority to seize and detain 
  aircraft.</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) Where the amount of any fees, charges and interest referred 
  to in subsection (1) has not been paid and the designated airport authority 
  has reason to believe that the person liable to pay the amount is about to leave 
  Canada or take from Canada any aircraft owned or operated by the person, the 
  authority may, in addition to any other remedy available for the collection 
  of the amount and whether or not a judgment for the collection of the amount 
  has been obtained, on ex parte application to the superior court of the province 
  in which any aircraft owned or operated by the person is situated, obtain an 
  order of the court, issued on such terms as the court considers necessary, authorizing 
  the authority to seize and detain aircraft.</p>
<p class="indent"> (3) Subject to subsection (4), except where other-wise directed 
  by an order of a court, a designated airport authority is not required to release 
  from detention an aircraft seized under subsection (1) or (2) unless the amount 
  in respect of which the seizure was made is paid.</p>
<p class="indent"> (4) A designated airport authority shall release from detention 
  an aircraft seized under subsection (1) or (2) if a bond, suretyship or other 
  security in a form satis-factory to the authority for the amount in respect 
  of which the aircraft was seized is deposited with the authority. </p>
<p class="indent"> (5) Words and expressions used in this section and section 
  10 have the same meaning as in the Aero-nautics Act.</p>
<p class="indent"> 10.(1) Any aircraft of a person referred to in sub-section 
  9(1) or (2) that would be exempt from seizure under a writ of execution issued 
  by the superior court of the province in which the aircraft is situated is exempt 
  from seizure and detention under that sub-section.</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) The Governor in Council may, by regulation, exempt any 
  aircraft from seizure and detention under section 9.</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) The CANSCA, ss. 56 and 57: </p>
<p class="indent"><span class="indent"> 56.(1) In addition to any other remedy 
  available for the collection of an unpaid and overdue charge imposed by the 
  Corporation for air navigation services, and whether or not a judgment for the 
  collection of the charge has been obtained, the Corporation may apply to the 
  superior court of the province in which any aircraft owned or operated by the 
  person liable to pay the charge is situated for an order, issued on such terms 
  as the court considers appropriate, authorizing the Corporation to seize and 
  detain any such aircraft until the charge is paid or a bond or other security 
  for the unpaid and overdue amount in a form satisfactory to the Corporation 
  is deposited with the Corporation.</span></p>
<p class="indent"> (2) An application for an order referred to in subsection (1)

  of the amount has been obtained, on application to the superior court of the 
  province in which any aircraft owned or operated by the person is situated, 
  obtain an order of the court, issued on such terms as the court deems necessary, 
  authorizing the Minister to seize and detain the aircraft.</span></p>
<p>
  (2) Overview of the Positions of the Parties</p>
<p>
  [121] The central issue concerning the seizure and detention claims is whether, 
  by virtue of s. 9 of the Airports Act and s. 56 of the CANSCA (the "Detention 
  Provisions"), the Authorities have seizure and detention rights concerning 
  the Aircraft ranking in priority to the pre-existing property rights in the 
  Aircraft of the Lessors, the legal titleholders to the Aircraft, entitling the 
  Authorities to seize and detain the Aircraft in the face of claims for repossession 
  and recovery of the Aircraft by the Lessors. </p>
<p>
  [122] The Airport Authorities submit that s. 9 of the Airports Act creates an 
  in rem right, or a right in the nature of a lien, that entitles them to seize 
  and detain the Aircraft until outstanding airport charges owed to them are paid, 
  and that this right is enforceable in priority to the Lessors' interests in 
  the Aircraft. NAV Canada asserts that s. 56 of the CANSCA creates a statutory 
  possessory lien that entitles it to seize and detain the Aircraft pending payment 
  of unpaid navigation charges owed to it. In the alternative, NAV Canada argues 
  that it is entitled to a lien arising at common law, which ranks in priority 
  to the interests of the Lessors in the Aircraft and which is analogous to a 
  right of distress granted by statute, upon the grant of an order under s. 56 
  of the CANSCA and upon the lien being exercised. </p>
<p>
  [123] The Lessors contend that the motions judge correctly held that the Authorities 
  do not enjoy a lien, or a right in the nature of a lien, arising by statute 
  or at common law concerning the Aircraft. They also argue that the motions judge 
  was right to hold that any seizure and detention rights of the Authorities do 
  not rank in priority to the rights of the Lessors to repossess and recover the 
  Aircraft. </p>
<p>
  [124] The motions judge held at para. 42 of his reasons for the May 7, 2002 
  Order that the Detention Provisions create "rights in favour of the [Authorities] 
  analogous to rights granted to a creditor who is successful in obtaining a Mareva 
  injunction" in the sense that, "as between the creditor and the debtor, 
  the creditor can insist that the property remain in place within the jurisdiction 
  until the creditor is paid or the right to payment finally determined." 
  In connection with the priority of the Authorities' asserted seizure and detention 
  rights, the motions judge concluded (at para. 43): </p>
<p class="indent"> I am not persuaded, however, that the legislation granting 
  such detention rights should be interpreted as creating rights against third 
  parties having ownership or perfected security interests in the aircraft such 
  that they, in effect, become liable for the debts of third parties and must 
  extinguish those debts before they can enforce their contractual rights to repossess 
  the aircraft or enter into possession of the aircraft to realize on their security. 
  There is nothing in the statutes to support such an interpretation so as to 
  defeat, or create priority over, the valid ownership and contractual rights 
  of such third parties. <a name="r15"></a><a href="#15">[15]</a> </p>
<p>
  [125] The Authorities submit that the motions judge made five principal errors 
  in his interpretation of the Detention Provisions: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) in his approach to the construction of the Detention Provisions;</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) in failing to find that the Detention Provisions create 
  a lien, or a right in the nature of a lien, concerning the Aircraft and by analogizing 
  the nature of the Authorities' detention rights to the rights afforded by a 
  Mareva injunction;</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) in declining to follow the Inter-Canadien case, supra;</p>
<p class="indent"> (iv) in holding that the Authorities' seizure and detention 
  rights do not rank in priority to the pre-existing property rights of third 
  parties, including the Lessors, in the Aircraft; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (v) in failing to have regard to policy considerations which 
  the Authorities assert support a liberal interpretation of the Detention Provisions.</p>
<p>
  [126] In my view, for the reasons that follow, the motions judge was correct 
  to conclude that the remedies afforded to the Authorities under the Detention 
  Provisions concerning the Aircraft, if granted by court order, do not create 
  rights having priority over the pre-existing interests in the Aircraft of the 
  Lessors, the legal titleholders to the Aircraft, entitling the Authorities to 
  detain the Aircraft in the face of claims for repossession and recovery of the 
  Aircraft by the Lessors. </p>
<p>
  (3) Preliminary Observations</p>
<p>
  [127] Several preliminary points should be made. First, the Airport Authorities 
  do not assert that the Lessors are directly liable for unpaid airport charges. 
  Rather, their claim against the Lessors depends on recognition of a statutory 
  or common law lien, or a right in the nature of a lien, concerning the Aircraft 
  that ranks in priority to the interests of the Lessors in the Aircraft. </p>
<p>
  [128] In contrast, NAV Canada argues that it is in a different position than 
  the Airport Authorities because ss. 55 and 56 of the CANSCA, in combination, 
  support a clear inference of a Parliamentary intention to confer priority on 
  NAV Canada's interest in the Aircraft over the interests of the Lessors in the 
  Aircraft. NAV Canada submits that since the Lessors are directly liable under 
  s. 55 for the payment of navigation charges, s. 56 simply permits the seizure 
  and detention of the debtor's property, in contrast to the property of a third 
  party, in potential satisfaction of the debt owed. Since I have already rejected 
  NAV Canada's argument concerning s. 55 of the CANSCA, NAV Canada's seizure and 
  detention claim rests on the same legal footing as the seizure and detention 
  claims of the Airport Authorities. </p>
<p>
  [129] Second, in this case, the Airport Authorities were not granted remedies 
  under the Detention Provisions prior to the CCAA Order and the bankruptcies 
  of the Canada 3000 Companies. As well, although NAV Canada applied under s. 
  56(1) of the CANSCA on November 9, 2001 for an order authorizing the seizure 
  and detention of the Aircraft, no order was granted in its favour prior to the 
  bankruptcies of the Canada 3000 Companies on November 11, 2001. Ultimately, 
  about six months later, the seizure and detention claims of the Authorities 
  were dismissed by the motions judge. The motions judge held that no steps had 
  been taken by the Authorities to seize the Aircraft prior to the date of the 
  bankruptcies. Consequently, none of the Authorities has exercised a remedy under 
  the Detention Provisions, nor taken possession of the Aircraft. </p>
<p>
  [130] The motions judge ruled that the Aircraft were not the property of the 
  Canada 3000 Companies and, therefore, were not subject to the proceedings under 
  the BIA involving the Canada 3000 Companies. He further held that the leasehold 
  interests of the Canada 3000 Companies in the Aircraft were of no value in the 
  circumstances and did not form part of the estates in bankruptcy of the Canada 
  3000 Companies. Consequently, he concluded that the Authorities' seizure and 
  detention claims were not affected by the automatic stay provisions of s. 69.3(1) 
  of the BIA and that no lifting of such a stay was required to permit the court 
  to authorize the seizure and detention of the Aircraft or to permit the Lessors 
  to proceed with their claims for repossession and recovery of the Aircraft.</p>
<p>
  [131] These rulings are not challenged by the Lessors on their cross-appeals 
  from the May 7, 2002 Order. Accordingly, on the facts of the case at bar, the 
  competing claims of the parties concerning the Aircraft fall to be determined 
  outside the bankruptcy regime.</p>
<p>
  [132] Third, several statutory prerequisites apply to the remedies under the 
  Detention Provisions. The only prerequisite at issue here is the requirement 
  under s. 9(1) of the Airports Act and s. 56(1) of the CANSCA that the aircraft 
  sought to be seized and detained is aircraft "owned or operated by the 
  person liable to pay the amount" in issue. See Edmonton Regional Airports 
  Authority v. Alta Flights (Charters) Inc., 2003 ABQB 791 at para. 46 (Alta. 
  Q.B.). </p>
<p>
  [133] Fourth, a remedy under either of the Detention Provisions is subject to 
  several constraints: (i) the remedy is not automatic and requires prior court 
  authorization; (ii) the remedy is discretionary and may be subject to such terms 
  as the court considers necessary; (iii) under s. 9(3) of the Airports Act and 
  s. 56(3)(c) of the CANSCA, the court also has a discretion to limit the duration 
  of the remedy by requiring the applicable authority to release a detained aircraft 
  from detention prior to payment of the amount with respect to which the seizure 
  was made; (iv) in any event, an authority that obtains an order under the Detention 
  Provisions is required to release a detained aircraft upon payment of the outstanding 
  amount or charges in respect of which the seizure was made, or upon the provision 
  of acceptable security therefor (ss. 9(3) and (4) of the Airports Act and ss. 
  56(1) and (3) of the CANSCA); and (v) an order is not available under the Detention 
  Provisions if the aircraft in respect of which the order is sought is exempt 
  from seizure and detention under provincial law (s. 10(1) of the Airports Act 
  and s. 57(1) of the CANSCA) or, in the case of the Airports Act, under regulation 
  made by the Governor in Council (s. 10(2)).</p>
<p>
  [134] Finally, it is useful at the outset to distinguish between an established 
  statutory right and a potential statutory remedy. The Authorities' seizure and 
  detention claims proceed on the premise that the Detention Provisions create 
  seizure and detention rights. In fact, the Detention Provisions do not create 
  any rights unless, and until, a court order is made authorizing the seizure 
  and detention of an aircraft. Instead, they create potential remedies, available 
  at the discretion of the court and subject to such conditions as the court considers 
  necessary. Thus, both Detention Provisions provide that recourse against aircraft 
  may be had thereunder "in addition to any other remedy available" 
  for the collection of the unpaid charges in issue [emphasis added]. The remedial 
  and discretionary nature of the Detention Provisions informs the analysis of 
  them. </p>
<p>
  (4) Approach to Construction</p>
<p>
  [135] The Authorities argue that the motions judge erred by applying principles 
  of strict construction in his interpretation of the Detention Provisions, thereby 
  contravening the approach to statutory interpretation mandated by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in Bell ExpressVu, supra, and related cases to which I have 
  previously referred. According to the Authorities, the motions judge's use of 
  a strict construction approach led him to wrongly conclude that the Detention 
  Provisions do not confer a lien, or a right in the nature of a lien, in respect 
  of the Aircraft.</p>
<p>
  [136] In his reasons for the May 7, 2002 Order, the motions judge said (at para. 
  34): </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am of the view&#133;that the general rule of law as stated in [Phoenix Assurance 
  Co. of Canada v. Toronto (City of) (1981), 35 O.R. (2d) 16 (H.C.J.) aff'd. (1982), 
  39 O.R. (2d) 680 (C.A.) and Royal Bank of Canada v. Sparrow Electric Corp., 
  [1997] 1 S.C.R. 411], that the court should not con-sider a lien to be imposed 
  without a plain declaration of the intention of the legislature to impose it 
  shown by clear and unambiguous language is the law of Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [137] Although considerable jurisprudential support exists for applying principles 
  of strict construction to the interpretation of a statutory provision that is 
  alleged to impose a charge or a duty, or to derogate from pre-existing property 
  or security rights, those prin-ciples are not engaged unless the meaning of 
  the applicable statutory provision is ambi-guous. As stated by the Supreme Court 
  of Canada in Morguard Properties Ltd. v. Winnipeg (City of), [1983] 2 S.C.R 
  493 at 510: "[T]he construction difficulty does not arise unless there 
  is some ambiguity to start with." Only if the words of the Detention Provisions 
  are truly ambiguous, in the sense that two or more interpretations of the words 
  of those provisions arise, each equally consistent with Parliamentary intent, 
  is it per-missible to resort to other principles of interpretation. In that 
  connection, Bell ExpressVu does not preclude the application of principles of 
  strict construction in a proper case; it merely limits the application of such 
  principles to instances of genuine ambiguity: Bell ExpressVu at paras. 28-30.</p>
<p>
  [138] It is important to underscore the requisite approach to the construction 
  of the Detention Provisions. As I stated earlier in these reasons, statutory 
  interpretation is not based solely on the wording of a challenged statutory 
  provision. This is especially significant in connection with the interpretation 
  of the Detention Provisions because the parties, all sophisticated and experienced 
  participants in the aviation industry, advance materially different interpretations 
  of the Detention Provisions which would lead to significantly different legal 
  and commercial results. The fact that scrutiny of the Detention Provisions may 
  yield two disparate interpretive readings, however, does not mean that the Detention 
  Provisions are ambiguous. </p>
<p>
  [139] In my view, an interpretation of the Detention Provisions which emphasizes 
  their plain language, as urged by the Authorities, is incomplete and pays insufficient 
  attention to the overall scheme of the Airports Act and the CANSCA, the objects 
  of the legislation, the legislative evolution and context of the Detention Provisions, 
  and the intention of Parliament. In Rizzo, supra, at paras. 21 and 23, the Supreme 
  Court of Canada indicated that statutory interpretation requires consideration 
  of the scheme and objects of the legislation at issue, the intention of Parliament 
  and the full context of the challenged words. In that connection, the use of 
  legislative history as a tool for determining the intention of Parliament was 
  held to be an entirely appropriate exercise: Rizzo at para. 31. Finally, as 
  Sullivan confirms at 10, the modern approach to statutory interpretation "calls 
  for the words of the text to be read in their entire context in every case, 
  not just in cases where the words seem ambiguous" [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [140] For the reasons that follow, on undertaking such a contextual and purposive 
  analysis of the Detention Provisions, I conclude that their meaning is clear 
  and unambiguous and that, properly read, they do not bear the construction urged 
  by the Authorities. </p>
<p>
  (5) The Claim of a Lien</p>
<p>
  [141] Much of the parties' submissions before this court focused on the issue 
  whether the remedies under the Detention Provisions, if granted, create lien 
  rights, or rights in the nature of a lien, in favour of the Authorities. In 
  my view, in the end, determination of the Authorities' seizure and detention 
  claims does not turn on this issue. Rather, the critical question is whether 
  the remedies under the Detention Provisions, if granted, create rights in the 
  Aircraft ranking in priority to the claims of the Lessors for repossession and 
  recovery of the Aircraft. Nonetheless, because the claim of a lien right, or 
  a right in the nature of a lien, was addressed by the parties at considerable 
  length in these proceedings, I will comment on this issue briefly. </p>
<p>
  [142] The motions judge correctly noted that the Detention Provisions make no 
  express mention of a lien; nor do they contain many of the traditional indicia 
  of a lien, such as a right to sell a seized aircraft if the charges with respect 
  to which the aircraft was seized remain unpaid. The Detention Provisions, therefore, 
  are distinguishable from other legis-lation in Canada that expressly confers 
  both a lien and a right of sale, or a lien and priority to the lienholder over 
  other claimants. See for example, the Canada Marine Act, S.C. 1998, c.10, s. 
  122(1); the Canada Petroleum Resources Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 36 (2nd Supp.), 
  s. 94(5); the repealed Canada Ports Corporation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C.9, ss. 
  43 and 45; the Municipal Act, 2001, S.O. 2001, c. 25, s. 349(3); and the Repair 
  and Storage Liens Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. R. 25, ss. 7 and 10. </p>
<p>
  [143] While it is true, as the Authorities argue, that aircraft detention remedies 
  are available in other jurisdictions, many of these remedies are distinguishable 
  from the Detention Provisions. For example, legislation in England provides 
  for the detention and sale of aircraft for unpaid airport or navigation charges. 
  Section 88(1)(b) of the Civil Aviation Act (1982) (U.K.), 1982, c. 16 permits 
  the sale of detained aircraft by an airport authority if airport charges remain 
  unpaid for 56 days from the date when the detention began, and s. 83(1) of the 
  Transport Act (2000) (U.K.), 2000, c. 38, in combination with associated regulations, 
  permits the detention and sale of aircraft for the non-payment of charges relating 
  to the supply of air traffic services. </p>
<p>
  [144] The statutory detention remedy under England's Civil Aviation Act (1982) 
  has been characterized as analogous to an ordinary possessory lien. In Bristol 
  Airport plc v. Powdrill, [1990] Ch. 744, the English Court of Appeal considered 
  the right of an airport authority to detain for unpaid airport charges aircraft 
  leased by an insolvent charter airline. At issue, among other matters, was whether 
  s. 88 of the English statute confers a lien or other security over the aircraft 
  within the meaning of the Insolvency Act 1986, (U.K.), 1986, c. 45, the legislation 
  governing the administration of insolvent estates. The court held that the statutory 
  detention provision creates a "lien or other security" in the aircraft. 
  In his judgment, Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C elaborated at 759-60 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There was some discussion in the course of argument whether the statutory right 
  of detention is strictly to be described as a 'lien'. It has many of the features 
  of a lien. It is a right of retention of chattels enjoyed by a creditor against 
  the payment of his charges for services rendered in relation to those chattels, 
  similar to the rights enjoyed by, for example, repairers of goods. The fact 
  that the right is conferred by statute is not inconsistent with it being a lien&#133;However, 
  it is not a possessory lien of the classic type, since (as will appear hereafter) 
  in my judgment the statutory right of detention conferred by s. 88 does not 
  give the airport legal possession of the aircraft whilst it is being detained. 
  But there are many species of lien which do not depend on possession, for example 
  certain equitable liens. &#133; [citations omitted and emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [145] He later stated at p. 765: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Moreover, although statutes have created statutory rights of distress, counsel 
  could find no case in which a statutory provision had been held to be a right 
  of distraint in the absence of clear words describing the right as a right to 
  distrain. Distress is an ancient remedy and to a degree obsolescent. In my judgment 
  in the absence of clear words in s. 88 describing the right to detain as being 
  a right of distress, it would be wrong to treat it as such [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [146] By analogy to Bristol Airport, the Authorities argue that the remedies 
  under the Detention Provisions confer a possessory right to retain property, 
  that is, aircraft, until a debt due to the person detaining the property is 
  satisfied. The motions judge rejected that notion of a "lien", on 
  the basis that it lacked judicial recognition in Canada. In fact, some support 
  for that notion of a lien may be found in Royal Trust Co. v. Molsons Bank (1912), 
  27 O.L.R. 441 (H.C.J.); Prete v. Lauzon and Fensom (1922), 52 O.L.R. 334 (S.C. 
  (App. Div.)); and Montreal Lithographing Ltd. v. Deputy Minister for Customs 
  and Excise, [1984] 2 F.C. 22 (T.D.). See also in England, in the maritime law 
  context, Hay &amp; Others v. Mersey Docks &amp; Harbour Board ("The Countess") 
  (1923), 14 L1. L. Rep. 441 (H.L.) at 444, per Lord Birkenhead.</p>
<p>
  [147] The legislative scheme in England concerning aircraft detention is materially 
  different than the legislative scheme in Canada under the Detention Provisions. 
  Accordingly, in my view, the decision in Bristol Airport is of limited value 
  as a precedent in this case. It is useful to make several observations in that 
  connection. First, as I have said, the enactment at issue in Bristol Airport 
  expressly provides for a right to detain and sell aircraft. In contrast, the 
  Detention Provisions provide for the seizure and the detention of aircraft, 
  but do not expressly grant a right to sell a seized and detained aircraft. The 
  remedy under each of the Detention Provisions contemplates, upon grant of a 
  court order, that the claiming authority may take possession of the aircraft, 
  thereby enforcing its court-approved remedy. As observed by the court in Bristol 
  Airport, however, some species of lien do not depend on possession. </p>
<p>
  [148] Second, and importantly, the Civil Aviation Act (1982) in England specifically 
  addresses the interests in aircraft of persons whose interests will be divested 
  by reason of the sale of a detained aircraft, including persons having legal 
  and equitable title to the aircraft. As observed by the court in Bristol Airport 
  at 760, s. 88(6) of that enactment itself "establishes its own order of 
  priorities in the application of proceeds of sale of the aircraft." The 
  statutory right to sell and the statutory priorities scheme have the effect 
  of divesting all interests in a sold aircraft, so as to vest full legal and 
  equitable title to the aircraft in the purchaser, leaving the original legal 
  owners of the aircraft to claim compensation from the surplus proceeds of sale. 
  The Detention Provisions, in contrast, do not expressly address priorities amongst 
  competing claimants to a detained aircraft.</p>
<p>
  [149] Given the international aviation example afforded by the English legislation, 
  it is telling that the legislative drafters of the Airports Act and the CANSCA, 
  both of which were introduced after the English statute, did not include priorities 
  language, a priorities scheme or a right to sell detained aircraft in the Detention 
  Provisions. That factor militates against the conclusion that the Detention 
  Provisions are intended to create a right having priority over the interests 
  of the legal titleholder to a detained aircraft. </p>
<p>
  [150] Third, notwithstanding the right of sale provided by the English statute, 
  the court in Bristol Airport held at 764 that, absent an overt act of detention, 
  the claiming airport authorities had no security in respect of the aircraft 
  and merely enjoyed a statutory right to create the security by an overt act 
  of detention. Under the English legislation, unlike the Detention Provisions 
  in this case, detention of an aircraft can be achieved without prior court authorization; 
  the sale of a detained aircraft, or other steps to enforce the detention remedy, 
  requires court approval.</p>
<p>
  [151] Finally, the trial judge in Bristol Airport, in the exercise of his discretion, 
  refused to grant the airport authorities leave to enforce their detention rights 
  on the basis that they were not secured creditors and, therefore, they should 
  not be allowed to gain priority over the other unsecured creditors of the insolvent 
  airline by detaining the aircraft. That ruling was upheld on appeal.</p>
<p>
  [152] The decision in Bristol Airport confirms that even if a statutory aircraft 
  detention remedy is regarded as creating a right or interest in a detained aircraft 
  in the nature of, or similar to, a lien or other security interest in the aircraft, 
  that right or interest is merely a legal possibility absent actual detention. 
  More importantly, Bristol Airport indicates that a statutory aircraft detention 
  remedy does not automatically confer priority on the claiming creditor over 
  other unsecured creditors. </p>
<p>
  [153] Liens recognized at common law are particular to the property for which 
  a service has been rendered: B. Ziff, Principles of Property Law, 3rd ed. (Toronto: 
  Carswell, 2000) at 408. In this case, the Authorities' claims concern outstanding 
  charges incurred for services relating to the very property sought to be seized 
  and detained, that is, the Air-craft. That factor supports the assertion that 
  the remedies under the Detention Provisions, if granted, create a possessory 
  lien or a right in the nature of a possessory lien concerning aircraft. At common 
  law, such possessory liens are regarded as mere passive rights of retention 
  which confer no right to sell or otherwise deal with the retained property. 
  The grant of such a lien may, but need not, confer priority on that lien over 
  pre-existing property and security interests in the property subject to the 
  lien. In that sense, such liens are a means of coercing payment, rather than 
  a security against payment not being made: C. Harpum, M. Grant and S. Bridge, 
  Megarry and Wade: The Law of Real Property, 6th ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell 
  Limited, 2000) at para. 19-002. See also Bristol Airport at p. 505, per Sir 
  Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C.</p>
<p>
  [154] The Authorities cite the decision of this court in Leavere v. Port Colborne 
  (City) (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 44 as an example of circumstances in which a possessory 
  lien was held to confer priority in respect of the property subject to the lien. 
  In my view, however, Leavere does not assist the Authorities. In that case, 
  it was held that the claimed liens arose by operation of law when the lien claimants 
  took possession of the chattels in the exercise of a statutory power to distrain. 
  Once that occurred, the lien that arose upon the exercise of the distraint right 
  took priority over pre-existing security interests. In contrast, in this case, 
  even if the Detention Provisions create or contemplate a lien or a right in 
  the nature of a right of distress, that right has not been recognized by the 
  court or exercised by the Authorities. As NAV Canada acknowledged in its factum 
  in the context of its assertion that it is entitled to a common law lien concerning 
  the Aircraft, that alleged entitlement is contingent "upon an order being 
  granted recognizing its seizure and detention ["rights"] and upon 
  those rights being exercised" [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [155] As I have said, however, the Authorities have no "rights" concerning 
  the Aircraft unless, and until, a seizure and detention order is granted by 
  the court. The critical issue is whether, if remedies under the Detention Provisions 
  are granted, the rights thereby created rank in priority to the claims of the 
  Lessors for repossession and recovery of the Aircraft. </p>
<p>
  [156] For the purpose of the disposition of this case, I am prepared to assume 
  that the grant of a court order under the Detention Provisions and the exercise 
  of the remedy thereby granted, brings into existence a possessory right to detain 
  the Aircraft pending payment, that is, a possessory lien or a right in the nature 
  of a possessory lien. In this case, no court order under the Detention Provisions 
  was granted prior to the bankruptcies of the Canada 3000 Companies. Therefore, 
  no possessory right in respect of the Aircraft was ever created. However, even 
  if such a possessory right is created by the granting of a court order, it does 
  not automatically follow that this right enjoys priority in the face of a claim 
  for repossession and recovery of the Aircraft by the Lessors. See for example, 
  British Columbia (Board of Industrial Relations) v. Avco Financial Services 
  Realty Ltd., [1979] 2 S.C.R. 699 and R. v. Dauphin Plains Credit Union Ltd., 
  [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1182. </p>
<p>
  [157] In other words, even if the remedy envisaged by the Detention Provisions 
  is granted by court order, thereby entitling the applicable authority to seize 
  and detain aircraft that are the subject of the order, a claim by the legal 
  titleholders to the detained aircraft may bring that detention right to an end. 
  I believe that the contextual and purposive considerations applicable to the 
  Detention Provisions establish that the seizure and detention remedies, if granted 
  and exercised, do not create a right concerning the Aircraft ranking in priority 
  to the interests of the Lessors in the Aircraft in the face of a claim by them 
  for repossession and recovery of the Aircraft. Accordingly, I turn now to these 
  contextual and purposive considerations. </p>
<p>
  (6) Contextual and Purposive Considerations</p>
<p>
  (a) Structure of the Detention Provisions</p>
<p>
  [158] The Detention Provisions clearly stipulate that aircraft may be subject 
  to a seizure and detention order. In that sense, the focus of the Detention 
  Provisions is on aircraft, not on persons, and the remedies afforded thereunder 
  are in rem remedies applicable to specific property. However, the Detention 
  Provisions also provide that only certain types of aircraft may be subject to 
  such an order, that is, aircraft "owned or operated by the person liable 
  to pay the amount" claimed to be owing. In my view, the phrase "owned 
  or operated", as it appears in the Detention Provisions, is integrally 
  connected to the phrase "by the person liable to pay the amount" and 
  both phrases must be read together in ascertaining the intended meaning and 
  scope of the Detention Provisions. As well, some meaning must be attributed 
  to each of the words or expressions used by Parliament. In addition, the entire 
  scheme of the Detention Provisions must be examined. With respect to the Airports 
  Act, ss. 9(1), (3) and (4) must be considered and, with respect to the CANSCA, 
  ss. 56(1) and (3) must be understood in the context of s. 55.</p>
<p>
  [159] The Airport Authorities argue that ss. 9(1), (3) and (4) of the Airports 
  Act, in combination, confer priority on the seizure and detention right of an 
  authority that obtains an order under s. 9(1). They argue, in effect, that because 
  ss. 9(3) and (4) authorize an authority that has seized an aircraft under s. 
  9(1) to detain that aircraft "unless the amount in respect of which the 
  seizure was made is paid" or satisfactory security therefor is deposited 
  with the authority and because s. 9(3) contains no language exempting the legal 
  titleholder to a detained aircraft from the ambit of s. 9(3), the authority 
  afforded under ss. 9(1), (3) and (4) implies the grant of priority over the 
  interests of such legal titleholders. The same argument is open to NAV Canada 
  based on the wording of ss. 56(1) and (3) of the CANSCA. The former provision 
  states, in part, that a seizure and detention order granted under that provision 
  permits NAV Canada to detain a seized aircraft "until the charge is paid" 
  or satisfactory security therefor is deposited with NAV Canada. The provisions 
  of s. 56(3)(a) and (b) of the CANSCA require the release of a detained aircraft, 
  absent a court order to the contrary under s. 56(3)(c), only under those conditions. 
  </p>
<p>
  [160] I am unable to accept this construction of the Detention Provisions. To 
  accede to that submission would be to allow ss. 9(3) and (4), in the case of 
  the Airports Act, to overtake the limitations applicable to a s. 9(1) order, 
  arising from the language of s. 9(1) itself. Sections 9(3) and (4) are concerned 
  with the release of detained aircraft, that is, the duration of the remedy under 
  s. 9(1), not with the nature or priority of the remedy. Similarly, to accept 
  this submission concerning s. 56(1) of the CANSCA would accord to the words 
  "until the charge is paid" - words importing a temporal element - 
  an override on the limitations applicable to a seizure and detention order arising 
  from the words "owned or operated by the person liable to pay" the 
  charge, as set out in s. 56(1). Sections 9(3) and (4) of the Airports Act and 
  s. 56(3) of the CANSCA do not enlarge the meaning of s. 9(1) of the Airports 
  Act and s. 56(1) of the CANSCA. Rather, the meaning and scope of the seizure 
  and detention remedies derives from the language used to actually create the 
  remedies, in contrast to the language which defines the duration of the remedies 
  by providing for the release of detained aircraft on certain conditions.</p>
<p>
  (b) Decision in Inter-Canadien</p>
<p>
  [161] As I have said, the Detention Provisions contain no language regarding 
  priorities among competing claimants to a detained aircraft; nor do they expressly 
  reference third parties who hold legal title to, or a perfected security interest 
  in, a detained aircraft. The Authorities submit that the absence of such language 
  indicates Parliament's intention that the remedies under the Detention Provisions 
  be interpreted so as to apply to such third parties. That submission is supported 
  by the decision in Inter-Canadien, supra. The Authorities argue that the motions 
  judge wrongly distinguished Inter-Canadien on the basis that it reflects the 
  law of Quebec, as distinct from the law of Canada as established by federal 
  legislation. I am not persuaded that Inter-Canadien is instructive in connection 
  with the Detention Provisions or that the motions judge erred in declining to 
  adopt its reasoning. I reach these conclusions for several reasons.</p>
<p>
  [162] First, while I agree with the Authorities that the legal character of 
  the seizure and detention remedies under the Detention Provisions, which are 
  created by federal legislation, cannot vary from province to province in Canada, 
  the manner of their enforcement may vary according to provincial laws. In other 
  words, in the exercise of seizure and detention remedies provided for under 
  federal legislation, the Authorities are not exempt from the requirement to 
  conform with provincial legislation governing the enforcement of creditors' 
  rights. </p>
<p>
  [163] Second, in Inter-Canadien, the airport authorities argued that the Detention 
  Provisions provide for a lien comparable to a common law right of distress. 
  Justice Tremblay held at para. 155 that "[T]he "right of detention 
  exercised by the [airport authorities]&#133;created a quasi-security on the 
  aircraft&#133;which resembles the 'right of distress' and is valid until the 
  claims are paid" [translated]. It seems to me, however, that security concerning 
  indebtedness, or a security interest in property, either exists or it does not. 
  The priority and enforceability of security are distinct from the existence 
  of security.</p>
<p>
  [164] Third, the quoted holding in Inter-Canadien was grounded on the fact that 
  the airport authorities in that case obtained court orders granting the remedies 
  under the Detention Provisions and exercised those court-sanctioned remedies 
  almost three and one-half months before the insolvency of the affected airline, 
  thereby obtaining actual possession and control of the aircraft. After reviewing 
  certain authorities concerning the nature of rights of distress, Tremblay J. 
  commented in Inter-Canadien at paras. 152-53: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the case at bar, the exercise of the right of detention was effected in December 
  of 1999 when the plaintiffs applied to the Superior Court of the District of 
  Montreal to obtain orders to seize and detain the aircraft.</p>
<p class="indent"> These judgments have the force of law and cannot be attacked 
  indirectly [translated and emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [165] In addition, Tremblay J.'s analysis in Inter-Canadien of the lien claims 
  of the applicable airport authorities was detailed under the heading: "Does 
  the exercise of the right of detention create a lien?" [emphasis added]. 
  See also Tremblay J.'s comments at paras. 50 and 61-63 concerning the exercise 
  by the airport authorities of the detention remedies granted to them by the 
  court.</p>
<p>
  [166] Accordingly, the key aspect of the Inter-Canadien case is the fact that 
  the airport authorities in that case had successfully obtained and exercised 
  court-sanctioned remedies under the Detention Provisions well in advance of 
  the bankruptcy of the airline. They had created security in the aircraft, in 
  fact and in law, prior to the bankruptcy events. Those facts stand in stark 
  contrast to the facts of the case at bar. </p>
<p>
  [167] Fourth, in Quebec, Articles 1592 and 1593 of the Civil Code of Quebec, 
  S.Q. 1991, c. 64 provide enforcement rights in favour of those persons who have 
  a right of retention concerning property. As detailed in Inter-Canadien, under 
  Article 1593, the right of retention in Quebec "may be set up against anyone" 
  in respect of a retention right under Article 1592. Article 1592 is premised 
  on the exercise of the retention right. It reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A party who, with the consent of the other party, has detention of property 
  belonging to the latter has a right to retain it pending full payment of his 
  claim against him, if the claim is exigible and is directly related to the property 
  of which he has detention [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  As observed by Tremblay J. at para. 109 of Inter-Canadien, the right of retention 
  under the Civil Code of Quebec is thus related to possession of the object itself. 
  Thus, Inter-Canadien supports the conclusion that the rights created by the 
  Detention Provisions do not transcend mere possibility until a court authorizes 
  the exercise of the right and the right in fact has been exercised.</p>
<p>
  [168] Finally, in Inter-Canadien, the court held at paras. 124 and 126 in connection 
  with the Detention Provisions, that the Airports Act and the CANSCA do not make 
  "any distinction regarding ownership; the right relates to the aircraft 
  which the defaulting party operates or operated" and that "the section 
  ignores the concept of ownership of the aircraft and applies the right of detention 
  to the item of property" [translated].</p>
<p>
  [169] The remedies under the Detention Provisions clearly apply to aircraft 
  "owned" or "operated" by the person liable to pay outstanding 
  airport or navigation charges. For that reason, as Canada 3000 and Royal operated 
  the Aircraft and are liable for such outstanding charges, the seizure and detention 
  remedies, if granted, are enforceable against them. I do not agree, however, 
  that the Detention Provisions ignore the concept of ownership of aircraft, or 
  fail to distinguish between owners and operators so as to confer priority on 
  the interests of the Authorities in the Aircraft in the face of repos-session 
  and recovery claims by the legal titleholders to the Aircraft. The legislative 
  history of the Detention Provisions, which I will consider next, is instructive 
  in that regard.</p>
<p>
  (c) Legislative History of the Detention Provisions</p>
<p> [170] Sections 9 and 10 of the Airports Act were introduced by amendment to 
  that Act several months after its original passage.<a name="r16"></a><a href="#16">[16]</a> 
  Bill S-11, the legislative bill containing those amendments, was described in 
  the House of Commons by the parliamentary secretary to the then Minister of 
  Transport as a "fine-tuning bill": House of Commons Debates (18 June 1992) at 
  12429 (Hon. Lee Richardson). The purpose of the amendments was described as 
  being "to extend to airport authorities the same powers, procedure and detention 
  of aircraft as currently exists in relation to major non-payment of fees": House 
  of Commons Debates (18 June 1992) at 12431 (Hon. Lyle Kristiansen).</p>
<p>
  [171] As well, during review of Bill S-11 by the Standing Senate Committee on 
  Transport and Communications, ss. 9 and 10 were said to be amendments to the 
  Act negotiated with local airport authorities "to give [such authorities] 
  substantially the same powers that subsections [4.5 and 4.6] of the Aeronautics 
  Act give to the Minister of Transport in connection with the seizure and detention 
  of aircraft" with the objective of providing such authorities with "leverage 
  that they could exercise against the airlines in the event they had some difficulties 
  collecting fees" [emphasis added]: Proceedings of Standing Senate Committee 
  on Transport and Communications (15 June 1992) at 23:41.</p>
<p>
  [172] A similar intent for s. 56(1) of the CANSCA is suggested by the legislative 
  history of that Act. The record before this court indicates that the clause-by-clause 
  analysis of the CANSCA presented to the Standing Senate Committee on Transport 
  and Commun-ications during its review of the CANSCA provided the following rationale 
  for the s. 56 seizure and detention remedy: </p>
<p class="indent">
  These powers of seizure are no greater than those enjoyed by the Minister under 
  the Aeronautics Act, or those given to airport operators under the [Airports 
  Act] [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [173] Thus, the legislative history of s. 9 of the Airports Act and of s. 56(1) 
  of the CANSCA indicates that the drafters of the Detention Provisions intended 
  to replicate in those provisions the same seizure and detention remedy which 
  existed under the Aeronautics Act. Examination of the Detention Provisions in 
  the context of the seizure and detention remedy under the Aeronauatics Act favours 
  the conclusion of the motions judge that the remedies under the Detention Provisions, 
  if granted, do not confer a right ranking in priority to the interests of the 
  Lessors in the Aircraft.</p>
<p>
  (d) Legislative Context of the Detention Provisions </p>
<p>
  [174] The language of the Detention Provisions is substantially identical to 
  the language of s. 4.5(1) of the Aeronautics Act. Section 4.5(1) of the Aeronautics 
  Act applies to "any aircraft owned or operated by the person" who 
  owes the amount of any charge, and interest thereon, imposed under s. 4.4 of 
  that Act [emphasis added]. The corresponding language of the Detention Provisions 
  refers to "any aircraft owned or operated by the person liable to pay" 
  the unpaid amount or charges in respect of which the seizure and detention order 
  is sought [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [175] The words "owned', "owner", "ownership", "operator" 
  and "operated" are not defined under the Airports Act. Section 9(5) 
  of the Airports Act, however, provides that words used in ss. 9 and 10 of that 
  Act have the same meaning as in the Aeronautics Act. I have previously indicated 
  in these reasons, in connection with s. 55 of the CANSCA, that the word "owner[s]" 
  has a special and settled meaning in the aviation context, namely, persons having 
  legal custody and control or who are otherwise in possession of an aircraft. 
  That meaning is confirmed in the instance of s. 9 of the Airports Act by the 
  combined effect of s. 9(5), which incorporates by reference into the Airports 
  Act the interpretation provisions of the Aeronautics Act, and s. 3(1) of the 
  Aeronautics Act, which confines the term "registered owner" to persons 
  having legal custody and control of an aircraft. As I have said, that definition 
  of "registered owner" was introduced to the Aeronautics Act expressly 
  to avoid an interpretation of "owner" which would extend to the legal 
  owners of aircraft, and to limit liability under that Act to those persons who 
  actually have control of aircraft.</p>
<p>
  [176] The legislative history of the s. 3(1) definition of "registered 
  owner" and of s. 4.4(5) of the Aeronautics Act, as previously described 
  in these reasons, confirms that Parliament expressly considered, and rejected, 
  the possible application of the concept of "owner" under the Aeronautics 
  Act to the financiers of aircraft. There is nothing in the legislative history 
  of s. 4.5(1) of the Aeronautics Act that suggests that the concept of "owner" 
  under that provision was intended to have a different, or larger, meaning. In 
  addition, on the record before this court, there is no suggestion that the seizure 
  and detention remedy under s. 4.5(1) of the Aeronautics Act was ever exercised, 
  or sought to be exercised, against the legal titleholders to aircraft as opposed 
  to airlines who defaulted in payment of outstanding airport charges.</p>
<p>
  [177] The legislative context of s. 9 of the Airports Act, which is linked to 
  the Aeronautics Act, therefore compels the conclusion urged by the Lessors, 
  that is, that the words "owned or operated by the person liable to pay" 
  in s. 9 merely ensure that both persons with legal custody and control of aircraft 
  (the "owners") and persons otherwise in possession of the aircraft 
  (the "operators") fall within the ambit of s. 9. Those persons are 
  the parties who actually use airport facilities and airport services, thereby 
  incurring charges for those services.</p>
<p>
  [178] I reach the same conclusion concerning the meaning of the words "owned 
  or operated by the person liable to pay", in s. 56 of the CANSCA. I have 
  earlier concluded that the word "owner[s]" under s. 55 of the CANSCA 
  refers to those persons in possession of aircraft and persons having legal custody 
  and control of aircraft. Words appearing in the same enactment bear the same 
  meaning throughout the enactment unless a contrary intention is clearly expressed: 
  the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, s. 15. See also Sullivan, supra, 
  at 162-63. No such contrary intention appears in the CANSCA in relation to s. 
  56. </p>
<p>
  [179] Moreover, as argued by NAV Canada, ss. 55 and 56 of the CANSCA must be 
  read together and the meaning of "owner" under s. 55 informs the meaning 
  and scope of s. 56. I have concluded that Parliament did not intend to fix liability 
  under s. 55 of the CANSCA for unpaid navigation charges on the legal titleholders 
  to aircraft. If, therefore, legal titleholders are not directly liable under 
  s. 55 for unpaid navigation charges, in my view it cannot reasonably be said 
  that Parliament intended to impose such liability indirectly, under s. 56, by 
  effectively requiring the legal titleholders to aircraft to pay outstanding 
  navigation charges or to post satisfactory security therefor as a prerequisite 
  to enforcing their rights to repossess and recover an aircraft. I agree with 
  the motions judge that s. 56 is not intended to have that result. </p>
<p>
  [180] Finally, I have also concluded that Parliament did not intend to effect, 
  under s. 55(1) of the CANSCA, a fundamental change to the scope of the joint 
  and several liability provision contained in s. 4.4(5) of the Aeronautics Act. 
  Similar reasoning applies concerning the scope of the Detention Provisions. 
  There is no indication in the Airports Act or the CANSCA that Parliament intended, 
  under the Detention Provisions, to enlarge the scope of the seizure and detention 
  remedy contained in s. 4.5(1) of the Aeronautics Act. Indeed, the legislative 
  history and context of the Detention Provisions suggests precisely the opposite.</p>
<p>
  (e) Purposes of the Detention Provisions, the Airports Act</p>
<p>
  and the CANSCA</p>
<p>
  [181] In his reasons for the May 7, 2002 Order, the motions judge indicated 
  at para. 73 that the Detention Provisions are "intended to provide protection 
  to the [Authorities] for collection of amounts owing to them." I would 
  express the purpose of the Detention Provisions this way: they are intended 
  to facilitate the collection of unpaid airport and navigation charges by providing 
  a pre- and post-judgment means of preventing the removal of aircraft from the 
  jurisdiction by the persons who are capable of effecting their prompt removal 
  and who are liable to pay those outstanding charges. </p>
<p>
  [182] The remedies under the Detention Provisions are expressed to be "in 
  addition to" any other remedy "available for the collection of the 
  amount" in issue. They are available both before and after any judgment 
  has been obtained "for the collection of the amount" owed. Thus, the 
  remedies under the Detention Provisions, if granted, entitle the Authorities, 
  as the detaining creditors, to restrain the use and operation of aircraft and, 
  hence, the removal of aircraft from the jurisdiction, prior to demonstration 
  of entitlement to the debt alleged to be owing. This is a powerful and extraordinary 
  collection tool. I agree with the motions judge that, in these respects, the 
  Detention Provisions enjoy some, although not all, of the attributes of a Mareva 
  injunction.</p>
<p>
  [183] Aircraft are highly mobile assets. As observed in Bristol Airport, supra, 
  at 764, once an aircraft leaves an airport, it may "have left the jurisdiction, 
  never to return and be beyond the reach of any order of the court." Alternatively, 
  if the aircraft does return, it may not return to the same airport. See also 
  Edmonton Regional Airports Authority, supra, at paras. 56 and 107. The Detention 
  Provisions are directed to that mischief. </p>
<p>
  [184] In that context, I agree with the motions judge that the Detention Provisions 
  are intended "to provide protection" for the collection of unpaid 
  airport and navigation charges. However, they are not intended to immunize the 
  Authorities from the financial losses attendant upon the inability to recover 
  outstanding charges in full. The Authorities are unsecured creditors. Upon the 
  grant of a court order under the Detention Provisions, they enjoy a collection 
  remedy not available to other ordinary unsecured creditors. That remedy is in 
  addition to, rather than in substitution for, usual collection remedies. It 
  is not a guarantee of the payment of unpaid charges. Accordingly, it cannot 
  be concluded that achievement of the purpose of the Detention Provisions requires 
  the assignment of priority to the seizure and detention claims of the Authorities 
  over the interests of the legal titleholders to the Aircraft when a claim for 
  repossession and recovery of the Aircraft is advanced by the titleholders.</p>
<p>
  [185] I have previously discussed in these reasons the purposes of both the 
  Airports Act and the CANSCA. The purpose of the Airports Act, as I have said, 
  is to provide for the transfer of certain airports previously operated by the 
  federal government to designated local airport authorities, with the object 
  of effecting a transfer of responsibility for the management and operation of 
  those facilities to those authorities. Similarly, the purpose of the CANSCA 
  is to effect the transfer of responsibility for the day-to-day operation and 
  management of Canada's civil air navigation system from the Government of Canada 
  to NAV Canada. The overall purposes of the Airports Act and the CANSCA are not 
  centred on the collection of charges for services rendered. The right to impose 
  charges and the authority to collect them form only part of the schemes of the 
  Airports Act and the CANSCA. The purposes of those enactments are not undermined 
  by an interpretation of the Detention Provisions which permits enforcement of 
  the remedies thereunder against those persons who are directly liable for unpaid 
  charges as, for example, a defaulting airline, but which precludes such enforcement 
  in priority to the interests of the legal titleholders to aircraft.</p>
<p>
  (f) Commercial Efficacy</p>
<p>
  [186] The Authorities argue that an interpretation of the Detention Provisions 
  that denies priority to their interests in the Aircraft over the interests of 
  the Lessors renders the seizure and detention remedies "useless" or 
  "meaningless" and devoid of commercial sense, because it fails to 
  accord meaning both to the word "owner" and the word "operator". 
  They submit that, under this interpretation, all that airlines need do to defeat 
  the seizure and detention remedies is to lease their aircraft from third parties, 
  as occurred in this case. They assert, therefore, that to give meaning to the 
  word "operator" in the Detention Provisions, priority must be recognized 
  for the seizure and detention right created upon grant by the court of the seizure 
  and detention remedy. </p>
<p>
  [187] Contrary to this submission, it is my view that the remedies under the 
  Detention Provisions are efficacious under the interpretation of those provisions 
  which I have outlined. In this case, all of the Aircraft were registered in 
  Canada 3000's name. Canada 3000 leased the Aircraft from the Lessors. It used 
  some of the Aircraft, and made available other Aircraft to Royal for its use. 
  Consequently, with respect to the Aircraft used by Royal, Canada 3000 was the 
  "owner" and Royal was the "operator" of the Aircraft. In 
  respect of the Aircraft used by Canada 3000, it was both the "owner" 
  and the "operator" of the Aircraft. In those circumstances, the remedies 
  under the Detention Provisions are potentially available as against both the 
  "owner" and the "operator" of the Aircraft. Thus, the remedies 
  are enforceable against the persons liable to pay the outstanding airport or 
  navigation charges, that is, the persons having legal custody and control or 
  who are otherwise in actual possession of the Aircraft. </p>
<p>
  [188] If seizure and detention orders are granted, enforcement of the remedies 
  permits the Authorities to ground aircraft, thereby preventing their removal 
  from the jurisdiction prior to the determination of a claim for payment of the 
  debt alleged to be owing; to prevent airlines from earning revenue, thereby 
  potentially triggering airline operating losses; to disrupt air travel; and, 
  potentially, to cause airlines to go into default under their leasing arrangements 
  with third party lessors, thus raising the risk of the permanent loss to them 
  of use of the aircraft. Those realities give considerable commercial vitality 
  to the seizure and detention remedies, through which the Authorities can compel 
  payment of charges owed from the parties who incurred them and who are liable 
  to pay them. </p>
<p>
  [189] Finally, the outlined interpretation of the reach of the Detention Provisions 
  ensures that a harmonious, coherent and consistent interpretation of the concepts 
  of "owner" and "operator" is afforded to each of the Airports 
  Act, the CANSCA and the Aeronautics Act, in accordance with the principles outlined 
  in Bell ExpressVu, supra, and Ulybel Enterprises, supra. That result recognizes 
  the inter-related relationship of those statutes and their associated positions 
  in Canada's wider legislative framework for the regulation of aeronautics.</p>
<p>
  (7) Conclusion Concerning the Seizure and Detention Claims </p>
<p>
  [190] I conclude that the remedies under the Detention Provisions, if granted, 
  do not create rights in the Aircraft that rank in priority to the interests 
  in the Aircraft of the Lessors, the legal titleholders to the Aircraft, in the 
  face of a claim for repossession and recovery of the Aircraft by the Lessors. 
  Consequently, they do not preclude the exercise by the Lessors of their contractual 
  rights to repossess and recover the Aircraft consequent upon the termination 
  of the Aircraft leases. The Detention Provisions are intended to apply to aircraft 
  of persons having legal custody and control or who are otherwise in possession 
  of the aircraft. They do not confer priority over the interests in detained 
  aircraft of the legal titleholders to such aircraft. That intended meaning is 
  unambiguously established by the language, legislative history, legislative 
  context and purpose of the Detention Provisions.</p>
<p>
  [191] I reach the same conclusion regarding the Authorities' seizure and detention 
  claims against the Engine Lessors, RRPF Engine Leasing Limited and Flight Logistics 
  Inc. Those respondents leased to Canada 3000 the engines attached to two of 
  the Aircraft. The motions judge held that even if the Authorities enjoy seizure 
  and detention rights that rank in priority to the interests of the Lessors in 
  the Aircraft, those rights do not have priority over the interests of the Engine 
  Lessors in the leased engines. He held that the Engine Lessors are not the owners 
  or the operators of the Aircraft; nor are they persons liable to pay the unpaid 
  airport or navigation charges claimed by the Authorities. I agree.</p>
<p>
  (8) Other Issues Concerning the Seizure and Detention Claims</p>
<p>
  [192] Something should also be said briefly about four other matters concerning 
  the seizure and detention claims. First, in view of my conclusion regarding 
  the Authorities' claim to priority over the interests of the Lessors in the 
  Aircraft, the motions judge's use of principles of strict construction in his 
  analysis of the Detention Provisions does not affect the result in this case. 
  However, if I am wrong in my conclusion that the meaning of the Detention Provisions 
  is not ambiguous, the principles of strict construction relied upon by the motions 
  judge are engaged. As argued by the Lessors, those principles establish a presumption 
  against interference with or limitation of private property rights absent a 
  clear and unambiguous declaration of Parliamentary intention to do so: see Phoenix 
  Assurance, supra, at 20-21; Sparrow Electric, supra, at para. 39; Morguard Properties, 
  supra, at 508-09; Avco Financial Services Realty Ltd., supra, at 706; Pacific 
  National Investments Ltd. v. Victoria (City), [2000] 2 S.C.R. 919 at para. 26; 
  First Vancouver Finance v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue), [2002] 2 S.C.R. 
  720 at paras. 32-35; and Sullivan, supra, at 400-403. The Detention Provisions 
  do not evidence such an intention. </p>
<p>
  [193] Second, the Authorities argue that the motions judge erred in his interpretation 
  of the Airports Act and the CANSCA by failing to have regard to policy considerations 
  supportive of a liberal interpretation of the Detention Provisions. They maintained 
  before the motions judge that they are involuntary creditors of the Canada 3000 
  Companies and that, having regard to their statutory mandates, their interests 
  should be preferred to those of the Lessors, sophisticated private sector financial 
  institutions. The motions judge declined to consider such factors in interpreting 
  the Detention Provisions. I do not think that he was wrong to take that view. 
  </p>
<p>
  [194] In oral argument before this court, the Authorities did not press their 
  assertion of this alleged error by the motions judge. The motions judge recognized 
  that the Authorities may be prevented by the bankruptcies of the Canada 3000 
  Companies from collecting in full the unpaid navigation and airport charges 
  owed to them. His task, however, was to interpret the statutory provisions at 
  issue in accordance with the contextual and purposive considerations applicable 
  to their analysis. Policy consider-ations concerning the respective economic 
  positions of the parties cannot control the meaning of the words which Parliament 
  elected to use. Any enlargement of the meaning or reach of the relevant sections 
  of the Airports Act and the CANSCA is a function for Parliament.</p>
<p>
  [195] Third, in my view, the motions judge was right to reject the submission 
  by some of the Lessors that the Aircraft are exempt from an order under the 
  Detention Provisions by virtue of s. 10 of the Airports Act and s. 57 of the 
  CANSCA. As held by the motions judge, execution does not apply, in the first 
  instance, to the property of a third party. Execution by a creditor is only 
  available concerning property that belongs to the debtor. In this case, after 
  the granting of the CCAA Order and the occurrence of the bankruptcies, the Aircraft 
  leases terminated and the Canada 3000 Companies ceased to have any interest 
  in the Aircraft susceptible to execution. Accordingly, no "exemption" 
  from execution is necessary and the statutory exemption provisions have no application.</p>
<p>
  [196] Finally, it is important to observe that, of course, it is open to Parliament 
  to provide, by clear and explicit statutory language, that the aircraft seizure 
  and detention remedies under the Airports Act and the CANSCA are available notwithstanding, 
  and in priority to, pre-existing property rights, including those of persons 
  who hold legal title to aircraft.</p>
<p>
  D. Subsidiary Issues </p>
<p>
  (1) Interest Claims</p>
<p>
  [197] The issue of interest claims only arises if the Authorities are successful 
  in the main appeals, that is, if it is determined that they enjoy rights under 
  the Detention Provisions or, in the case of NAV Canada, under s. 55 of the CANSCA, 
  that are enforceable against the Lessors. Accordingly, on the view that I hold 
  of the Authorities' claims under the Detention Provisions and of NAV Canada's 
  claim under s. 55 of the CANSCA, the issues concerning entitlement to interest 
  and the accrual period for such interest need not be determined. </p>

<p>
  (2) Detention Costs </p>
<p>
  [198] As I have stated previously, in the Release Protocols Order, the motions 
  judge directed the parties to bear their own costs of compliance with the release 
  protocols regardless of the ultimate disposition of the seizure and detention 
  motions. The Lessors appeal that aspect of the Release Protocols Order, claiming 
  that the Authorities are liable for the Lessors' costs in connection with "the 
  detention, care, maintenance, storage and/ or preservation of aircraft&#133;including 
  costs of posting security", and consequential damages. Although a second 
  group of Lessors, in their Notice of Appeal, appealed the Release Protocols 
  Order in connection with the costs of posting security and the form of security, 
  that issue was not advanced in their written or oral submissions before this 
  court.</p>
<p>
  [199] In his May 7, 2002 Order, however, the motions judge ordered the Authorities 
  to reimburse the Lessors for their Detention Costs. The Authorities challenge 
  that re-imbursement order on three main grounds. First, they assert that the 
  motions judge lacked jurisdiction to order such reimbursement because he had 
  already adjudicated on the issue in his reasons for the Release Protocols Order 
  and, in addition, he failed to receive further submissions on the issue during 
  the proceedings which led to the May 7, 2002 Order. Second, the Authorities 
  submit that the reimbursement order cannot stand because the motions judge failed 
  to provide any reasons therefor. Third, the Authorities maintain that if the 
  reimbursement order is upheld, certain Lessors will realize an unanticipated 
  and improper windfall.</p>
<p>
  [200] I do not agree that the motions judge lacked jurisdiction to order reimbursement 
  by the Authorities of the Lessors' Detention Costs. The purpose of the release 
  protocols, as approved under the Release Protocols Order, was to facilitate 
  the release of the Air-craft to the Lessors upon provision of security for the 
  charges allegedly owing to the Authorities, prior to the final determination 
  of the seizure and detention motions and the Lessors' cross-motions. The Release 
  Protocols Order was an interim relief order pending final determination of the 
  various and competing claims of the parties. It was not intended to, nor did 
  it, finally determine the issues in dispute. </p>
<p>
  [201] That the Release Protocols Order was not a final adjudication of the issues 
  in dispute is established by the terms of the release protocols themselves. 
  Each release protocol specifically provided that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The release of the Aircraft, and the posting of the Security by the Lessors 
  and the acceptance thereof by the [Authorities] shall be without prejudice to 
  any point of fact or law or any position that any of the Lessors or the [Authorities] 
  may wish to bring forward in the Seizure Motions and any subsequent appeals.</p>
<p>
  This clause was broadly cast. On its face, it preserved the right of the Lessors 
  to advance claims for reimbursement of their Detention Costs and the Authorities' 
  right to contest such claims. </p>
<p>
  [202] As well, the motions judge referred to the Release Protocols Order as 
  a "compromise procedure". He rejected a proposal by the Lessors that 
  the release protocols include a term holding the Authorities liable for the 
  costs of posting security in the event that the Authorities ultimately were 
  unsuccessful on their seizure and detention motions. In addition, he declined 
  to accept the Lessors' submission, in the proceedings leading to the Release 
  Protocols Order, that the Authorities be required to provide an undertaking 
  in damages as a condition of proceeding with their seizure and detention motions.</p>
<p>
  [203] In those circumstances, the motions judge's direction in the Release Protocols 
  Order that each party bear its own costs of compliance with the release protocols 
  regardless of the ultimate disposition of the seizure motions is difficult to 
  reconcile with the overall interim nature of the release protocols and the Release 
  Protocols Order, and with the preservation of rights clause contained in each 
  release protocol. </p>
<p>
  [204] In any event, the motions judge had jurisdiction, in his discretion, to 
  revisit the issue of reimbursement of the Detention Costs, as fairness and the 
  circumstances of the BIA proceedings might require. As the Authorities acknowledge, 
  the exercise of a judge's discretion in such proceedings does not easily attract 
  appellate interference: Algoma Steel Inc. v. Union Gas Ltd. (2003), 63 O.R. 
  (3d) 78 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [205] Several other factors are also relevant to the motions judge's rulings 
  concerning reimbursement of the Detention Costs. First, although the Lessors' 
  specifically claimed reimbursement of the Detention Costs in their cross-motions 
  before the motions judge, after the motions judge's reasons for the Release 
  Protocols Order were released certain of the major participants in this case 
  entered into correspondence which contemplated that only "main issues of 
  principle" would be dealt with on the hearing dates reserved for argument 
  of the seizure and detention motions and the Lessors' cross-motions. Counsel 
  intended that "subsidiary" issues would be addressed thereafter, as 
  necessary. The Lessors did not suggest that reimbursement of the Detention Costs 
  or the revisiting of the direction in the Release Protocols Order concerning 
  the Detention Costs should be included as "main issue[s] of principle". 
  </p>
<p>
  [206] Accordingly, in light of the direction in the Release Protocols Order 
  regarding the reimbursement issue and the subsequent correspondence among counsel, 
  the potential for misunderstanding existed. At a minimum, there is a basis to 
  conclude that the parties were not "on the same page" concerning this 
  issue. I also note that in his reasons for the May 7, 2002 Order, the motions 
  judge did not include reimbursement of the Detention Costs in his list of the 
  issues raised for determination, although he ultimately dealt with the matter 
  in his reasons.</p>
<p>
  [207] Second, only parts of some of the facta filed with the motions judge on 
  the seizure and detention motions and the Lessors' cross-motions form part of 
  the record in these proceedings. As a result, this court is not in a position 
  to determine whether the Lessors pressed their reimbursement claims before the 
  motions judge in the proceedings after the date of the Release Protocols Order. 
  The Authorities assert that no oral submissions were made on this issue during 
  those proceedings. </p>
<p>
  [208] The Lessors' reimbursement claims are cast in the widest possible terms. 
  For example, in the factum filed with this court by some of the Lessors on their 
  appeal from the Release Protocols Order, these Lessors seek recovery in damages 
  of "an amount equal to the costs of posting security and costs of interim 
  maintenance, as well as all direct, indirect and consequential damages caused 
  to, or suffered by, the Lessors as a result of not being permitted to recover 
  possession or control of its [sic] aircraft pending the determination of the 
  [Authorities'] seizure and detention claims." It appears that substantially 
  the same claim was advanced before the motions judge. In the face of such an 
  open-ended claim of unspecified magnitude, it is difficult to conceive that 
  no response would have been forthcoming from the Authorities before the motions 
  judge had they clearly understood that the issue remained or was again in play. 
  </p>
<p>
  [209] Finally, in the absence of reasons from the motions judge for the reimbursement 
  ruling in the May 7, 2002 Order, this court cannot ascertain with certainty 
  the nature or quantum of the amounts in issue or the basis for the motions judge's 
  reconsideration of his earlier ruling concerning the Detention Costs. </p>
<p>
  [210] For those reasons, I conclude that fairness to the parties and the need 
  to provide a proper basis for appellate review, if necessary, require a new 
  hearing on this issue. </p>
<p>
  (3) Admissibility of the Gray Affidavits</p>
<p>
  [211] In oral argument before this court, NAV Canada did not press its assertion 
  that the redacted versions of the Gray Affidavits were inadmissible and that 
  the motions judge erred in his assignment of weight to them. As some of the 
  parties addressed these issues in their facta, however, I will comment on them 
  briefly. </p>
<p>
  [212] The Gray Affidavits contained evidence concerning the legislative history 
  of the CANSCA and the Airports Act. As argued by the Lessors, most statements 
  originally set out in the Gray Affidavits concerning Canadian domestic law were 
  deleted from the redacted versions admitted by the motions judge. In his reasons 
  for the May 7, 2002 Order, the motions judge ruled at para. 20 that the redacted 
  Gray Affidavits were admissible "to the extent that they set forth the 
  legislative history leading up to the enactment of the Airports Act and the 
  CANSCA" [emphasis added]. The motions judge correctly recognized, and the 
  Authorities concede, that legislative history is admissible as an aid to statutory 
  interpretation. Indeed, in my view, the legislative history of the enactments 
  in issue and of the challenged statutory provisions was admissible without the 
  necessity of sworn affidavit evidence. </p>
<p>
  [213] The motions judge expressly indicated that he was assigning little weight 
  to those parts of the redacted Gray Affidavits that contained references to 
  the statements of various persons within government and the airlines industry 
  concerning the intention of Parliament in enacting the legislation at issue. 
  He also admitted an affidavit tendered by NAV Canada in response to the first 
  Gray Affidavit.</p>
<p>
  [214] The use of the redacted Gray Affidavits by the motions judge was thus 
  limited and confined to consideration of the legislative history of the Airports 
  Act and the CANSCA. Further, the Authorities were provided with an opportunity 
  to respond to the Gray Affidavits. The issue of Parliament's intention in enacting 
  ss. 9 and 10 of the Airports Act and ss. 55 and 56 of the CANSCA was fully argued 
  by the parties before the motions judge. In those circumstances, in my view, 
  the motions judge did not err in his admission or use of the redacted Gray Affidavits. 
  </p>
<p>
  (4) Costs of the Proceedings Before the Motions Judge</p>
<p>
  [215] The Lessors submit that the motions judge erred by failing to award them 
  their costs of the proceedings before him. They rely on the general rule that 
  costs follow the event absent special circumstances. They also assert that the 
  matters considered by the motions judge did not raise novel issues of law, but 
  that even if they did this was insufficient to warrant a departure from the 
  general costs recovery rule. As well, the Lessors submit that any public interest 
  justification for denying them their costs should not apply where a party is 
  seeking to protect its commercial interests.</p>
<p>
  [216] The Lessors do not dispute that a judge has a wide discretion concerning 
  the awarding of costs in civil proceedings. Appellate courts are loathe to interfere 
  with a judge's exercise of discretion concerning costs and will only do so in 
  very limited circumstances: Bell Canada v. Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. 
  (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 135 at 141-42 (C.A.); Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Matsqui 
  Indian Band, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 3 at 32; and Mete v. Guardian Insurance Co. of 
  Canada (1998), 165 D.L.R. (4th) 457 at paras. 15-16 (Ont. C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [217] The motions judge's reasons in support of his costs disposition were released 
  on July 24, 2002. They indicate that he considered all of the circumstances 
  of the proceedings before him, including the public interest, certain rulings 
  made in favour of the Authorities as distinct from the Lessors, and the novelty 
  of the issues raised. Contrary to the Lessors' submission before this court, 
  a motion need not "forge a new legal principle" to raise a novel issue 
  of law: Ortiz v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co. (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 
  130 at para. 14 (C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [218] This case raised important issues of interpretation concerning the CANSCA 
  and the Airports Act not previously considered by an Ontario court and, at the 
  time of the proceedings before the motions judge, addressed in only one previously 
  reported decision of another Canadian court. In addition, the demise of the 
  Canada 3000 Companies gave rise to issues of broad public interest, as well 
  as matters relating to the commercial rights of the parties. I agree with the 
  motions judge's observation in his reasons concerning costs: "There is 
  also&#133;an element of public interest in having the seizure rights of the 
  Authorities, which impact upon the traveling public and the travel industry 
  in Canada, being judicially scrutinized." As well, the motions judge found 
  that the Authorities acted reasonably in bringing their motions. The Lessors 
  have not demonstrated that the motions judge's costs decision was unreasonable. 
  Accordingly, in my view, there is no basis on which to interfere with his costs 
  disposition. </p>
<p>
  V. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [219] In summary, for the reasons given, I conclude that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) the motions judge correctly held that the Lessors are not liable to NAV 
  Canada under s. 55 of the CANSCA for unpaid navigation charges;</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) the motions judge also correctly held that the remedies 
  under the Detention Provisions, if granted to the Authorities, do not create 
  rights in the Aircraft which rank in priority to the Lessors' interests in the 
  Aircraft, and to the Engine Lessors' interests in the engines attached to the 
  Aircraft, in the face of claims by the Lessors and the Engine Lessors for repossession 
  and recovery of the Aircraft and the engines;</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) that part of the Release Protocols Order concerning reimbursement 
  of the Detention Costs and that part of the May 7, 2002 Order requiring the 
  Authorities to reimburse the Lessors for their Detention Costs cannot stand 
  and a new hearing is required on this issue;</p>
<p class="indent"> (iv) the redacted versions of the Gray Affidavits were admissible 
  and the motions judge did not err in his assignment of weight to them;</p>
<p class="indent"> (v) there is no basis on which to interfere with the motions 
  judge's costs disposition in the proceedings before him; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (vi) it is unnecessary to determine the other subsidiary issues 
  arising in these proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [220] Accordingly, I would allow that part of the Authorities' main appeals 
  from the May 7, 2002 Order and the Lessors' appeals from the Release Protocols 
  Order concerning reimbursement of the Lessors' Detention Costs, set aside paragraph 
  8 of the May 7, 2002 Order, and direct a new hearing before the motions judge 
  on that issue. I would dismiss the Authorities' appeals from the May 7, 2002 
  Order in all other respects. I would also grant leave to the Lessors to cross-appeal 
  from the motions judge's disposition of costs in the proceedings before him 
  and dismiss the entirety of their cross-appeals.</p>
<p>
  [221] As agreed by the Authorities and the Engine Lessor, RRPF Engine Leasing 
  Limited, as between those parties, there shall be no award of costs in these 
  proceedings. As between the Authorities, the Lessors and the remaining Engine 
  Lessor, Flight Logistics Inc., the Lessors and that Engine Lessor shall deliver 
  their written submissions concerning the costs of the proceedings before this 
  court within two weeks from the date hereof, the Authorities shall deliver their 
  responding costs submissions in writing within two weeks thereafter, and the 
  Lessors and Flight Logistics Inc. shall deliver their written reply submissions 
  concerning costs, if any, within one week from the date of their receipt of 
  the Authorities' written submissions.</p>

</p>
<p> JURIANSZ J. (ad hoc) (Dissenting in Part) </p>
<p>
  [222] I am in general agreement with the reasons of Cronk J.A., except for her 
  interpretation of the Detention Provisions. Her comprehensive and thoughtful 
  reasons enable me to state my own briefly. I adopt her review of the facts, 
  the proceedings, and the positions of the parties and I employ the abbreviations 
  and the nomenclature that she used. As she did, I will refer to the Airport 
  Transfer (Miscellaneous Matters) Act, S.C. 1992, c. 5 as the "Airports 
  Act", the Civil Air Navigation Services Commercialization Act, S.C. 1996, 
  c. 20 as the "CANSCA", the seizure and detention provisions concerning 
  aircraft under s. 9 of the Airports Act and s. 56 of the CANSCA as the "Detention 
  Provisions", the Airport Authorities and Nav Canada collectively as the 
  "Authorities", and the respondents to the main appeals as the "Lessors". 
  </p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [223] The Lessors submitted that the Detention Provisions should be strictly 
  construed as there is a presumption against interference with pre-existing property 
  rights without express statutory language. </p>
<p>
  [224] The strict or liberal construction doctrine has been the subject of some 
  criticism in recent years. Professor Ruth Sullivan in Statutory Interpretation 
  (Concord, Ontario: Irwin Law, 1997) observes at pp. 168-169: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;Since most legislation both interferes with some persons and benefits 
  others, there is often no basis for the distinction other than the preferences 
  of the classifying court. If the court values the social policies served by 
  the Legislature more than the rights interfered with, the legislation will attract 
  a liberal construction; otherwise not.</p>
<p>
  [225] As a result, Prof. Sullivan says, on page 169, strict construction tends 
  to place the courts in an adversarial relationship with the legislature, diverting 
  them from trying to implement the legislature's goals as fully as possible, 
  as the courts focus "on reasons to limit the scope and impact of the legislation". 
  </p>
<p>
  [226] Professor Sullivan goes on to point out that while s. 12 of the Interpretation 
  Act, R.S.C. C.1-21 effectively abolishes the strict construction doctrine in 
  principle by deeming every enactment remedial and requiring that it be "given 
  such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures 
  the attainment of its objects", in practice it has had little impact on 
  how courts interpret legislation. </p>
<p>
  [227] Professor Sullivan observes at page 169 that in recent years the courts 
  tend to give more weight to the "benevolent goals of legislation" 
  and the strict construction doctrine is treated as a rule of last resort "used 
  only for the purpose of resolving any doubt or ambiguity remaining after the 
  court has explored all the other ways of establishing legislative intent". 
  </p>
<p>
  [228] As Cronk J.A. points out, it is now accepted that the strict construction 
  approach should be applied only where there is some ambiguity in the statutory 
  provision being interpreted. I agree with her that the words of the Detention 
  Provisions are clear and unambiguous. Consequently, they should not be strictly 
  construed in order to avoid interference with pre-existing property interests. 
  </p>
<p>
  [229] Even if there were ambiguity in the Detention Provisions, my view is that 
  resort to strict construction would be inappropriate in this case. The Lessors' 
  property rights in the aircraft should not be regarded as those of uninvolved 
  third party strangers to the outstanding charges of the Authorities. They leased 
  their aircraft to the Canada 3000 Companies to be flown using the air navigation 
  services provided by NAV Canada, and to use the airport facilities and services 
  provided by the Airport Authorities. The outstanding charges are not general 
  debts of the Canada 3000 Companies, but those debts incurred by the use of the 
  Lessors' aircraft just as the Lessors contemplated and expressly authorized. 
  None of the strict construction authorities cited by the Lessors, on my reading, 
  deals with the situation where the debts sought to be charged against private 
  property were incurred by the use of that property as authorized by the owner. 
  </p>
<p>
  [230] In argument, the Lessors suggested that Royal Bank of Canada v. Sparrow 
  Electric Corp., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 411 was such a case. In Sparrow, the Royal Bank 
  had a general security agreement covering all of Sparrow's present and after 
  acquired property, and an assignment of inventory under the Bank Act. The outstanding 
  amounts sought to be charged against the Bank's property interests were statutory 
  deductions from the wages of Sparrow's employees. The Royal Bank had no connection 
  to Sparrow's employees. </p>
<p>
  [231] This case is different because the Lessors are directly connected to the 
  aircraft that were used to incur the charges. They are the legal owners and 
  they authorized the use of their aircraft in the manner that incurred the outstanding 
  charges. </p>
<p>
  [232] Many of the leases also provided for payment by the Canada 3000 Companies 
  to the Lessors of substantial security deposits to secure performance under 
  the leases, including redelivery of the aircraft, the obligation of Canada 3000 
  to pay navigation charges and airport fees, and to indemnify the Lessors in 
  the event of the seizure of aircraft for nonpayment of navigation charges or 
  airport fees. (Affidavits of Felice Zalcberg sworn December 14, 2001). This 
  clearly shows the Lessors appreciated that the use they authorized of their 
  property would incur such charges, and that such charges, if left unpaid, could 
  result in the seizure of their property. </p>
<p>
  [233] As I stated I consider the meaning of the Detention Provisions to be clear 
  and unambiguous. The view I take leads to a different result then reached by 
  Cronk J.A. I repeat the Detention Provisions for the convenience of the reader: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Airports Act s. 9: </p>
<p class="indent">
  9.(1) Where the amount of any landing fees, general terminal fees or other charges 
  related to the use of an airport, and interest thereon, set by a designated 
  airport authority in respect of an airport operated by the authority has not 
  been paid, the authority may, in addition to any other remedy available for 
  the collection of the amount and whether or not a judgment for the collection 
  of the amount has been obtained, on application to the superior court of the 
  province in which any aircraft owned or operated by the person liable to pay 
  the amount is situated, obtain an order of the court, issued on such terms as 
  the court considers necessary, authorizing the authority to seize and detain 
  aircraft.</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) Where the amount of any fees, charges and interest referred 
  to in subsection (1) has not been paid and the designated airport authority 
  has reason to believe that the person liable to pay the amount is about to leave 
  Canada or take from Canada any aircraft owned or operated by the person, the 
  authority may, in addition to any other remedy available for the collection 
  of the amount and whether or not a judgment for the collection of the amount 
  has been obtained, on ex parte application to the superior court of the province 
  in which any aircraft owned or operated by the person is situated, obtain an 
  order of the court, issued on such terms as the court considers necessary, authorizing 
  the authority to seize and detain aircraft.</p>
<p class="indent"> (3) Subject to subsection (4), except where other-wise directed 
  by an order of a court, a designated airport authority is not required to release 
  from detention an aircraft seized under subsection (1) or (2) unless the amount 
  in respect of which the seizure was made is paid.</p>
<p class="indent"> (4) A designated airport authority shall release from detention 
  an aircraft seized under subsection (1) or (2) if a bond, suretyship or other 
  security in a form satisfactory to the authority for the amount in respect of 
  which the aircraft was seized is deposited with the authority. </p>
<p class="indent"> (5) Words and expressions used in this section and section 
  10 have the same meaning as in the Aeronautics Act.</p>
<p>
  The CANSCA, s. 56: </p>
<p class="indent">
  56.(1) In addition to any other remedy available for the collection of an unpaid 
  and overdue charge imposed by the Corporation for air navigation services, and 
  whether or not a judgment for the collection of the charge has been obtained, 
  the Corporation may apply to the superior court of the province in which any 
  aircraft owned or operated by the person liable to pay the charge is situated 
  for an order, issued on such terms as the court considers appropriate, authorizing 
  the Corporation to seize and detain any such aircraft until the charge is paid 
  or a bond or other security for the unpaid and overdue amount in a form satisfactory 
  to the Corporation is deposited with the Corporation.</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) An application for an order referred to in subsection (1) 
  may be made ex parte if the Corporation has reason to believe that the person 
  liable to pay the charge is about to leave Canada or take from Canada any aircraft 
  owned or operated by the person.</p>
<p class="indent"> (3) The Corporation shall release from detention an aircraft 
  seized under this section if</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the amount in respect of which the seizure was made is 
  paid;</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) a bond or other security in a form satisfactory to the 
  Corporation for the amount in respect of which the seizure was made is deposited 
  with the Corporation; or</p>
<p class="indent"> (c) an order of a court directs the Corporation to do so.</p>
<p>
  [234] Section 9(1) of the Airports Act and s. 56(1) of the CANSCA both allow 
  an Authority to apply to the court to seize and detain "aircraft owned 
  or operated by the person liable to pay". The phrase "owned or operated 
  by the person liable to pay" serves to identify which aircraft may be seized 
  and detained. The words "is situated" that follow the foregoing phrase 
  refer back to "aircraft". Thus, the Detention Provisions focus on 
  "aircraft" and not on "persons liable to pay". The remedy 
  the Detention Provisions provide to the Authorities relates to aircraft, and 
  not to the persons liable to pay the charges. </p>
<p>
  [235] Separate meaning must be attached to the word "seize" and the 
  word "detain". The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines "seize" 
  as "take possession of by warrant or legal right, confiscate, impound, 
  attach". It defines "detain" as "keep in confinement or 
  under restraint; keep waiting, delay". </p>
<p>
  [236] The Authorities (upon obtaining a court order) may take possession of 
  aircraft and then keep the aircraft under restraint. The aircraft must be either 
  "owned" or "operated" by a person who is liable to pay. 
  Either is a sufficient basis for an application. </p>
<p>
  [237] I agree, for the reasons given by Cronk J.A., that the word "owned" 
  refers to the person registered in the Canadian Civil Aircraft Register as the 
  person having legal custody and control of the aircraft under the Aeronautics 
  Act. I also agree with Cronk J.A. that the meaning of "operated" is 
  traced back to the meaning of "operator" in the Canadian Aviation 
  Regulations, S.O.R./1996-433 made under the Aeronautics Act. There, "operator" 
  is defined as "the person that has possession of the aircraft as owner, 
  lessee or otherwise" (emphasis added). </p>
<p>
  [238] Since the Detention Provisions make operation by a lessee a sufficient 
  basis for an application to seize and detain aircraft, they unquestionably contemplate 
  seizure and detention of aircraft that are leased from lessors who hold legal 
  title to the aircraft. </p>
<p>
  [239] Stated more broadly, the wording of the Detention Provisions makes apparent 
  that aircraft may be seized and detained without regard to the property interests 
  of persons who are neither the registered owners nor the operators of the aircraft 
  under the legislation. As long as the aircraft is owned or operated by a person 
  liable to pay the outstanding charges, it may be the subject of an application 
  to seize and detain it. The fact that there may be other persons, who are not 
  liable to pay the outstanding charges but have property interests in the aircraft, 
  is of no consequence. </p>
<p>
  [240] Both the Airports Act and the CANSCA impose charges on persons who use 
  the Authorities' services and the Authorities can resort to conventional remedies 
  for the collection of those charges. Those remedies have no impact on the rights 
  of persons who have property interests in the aircraft. However, the Detention 
  Provisions are stated to provide remedies "in addition to any other remedy 
  available for the collection" of the outstanding charges. The Detention 
  Provisions clearly do have an impact on the rights of persons with property 
  interests in the aircraft since they permit seizure and detention of aircraft 
  operated by persons with bare possession. The question to be determined is the 
  extent and duration of the interference with pre-existing property interests 
  in the aircraft.</p>
<p>
  [241] The language that addresses the release of seized aircraft from detention 
  is particularly telling. The only circumstances in which the Detention Provisions 
  contemplate the release of aircraft seized from detention are that the outstanding 
  charges are paid, security is deposited or the court so directs. Section 9(3) 
  of the Airports Act states that, unless otherwise directed by a court, an airport 
  authority "is not required to release from detention an aircraft&#133;unless 
  the amount in respect of which the seizure was made is paid". Section 56(1) 
  of the CANSCA allows NAV Canada to detain seized aircraft "until the charge 
  is paid" or satisfactory security is deposited. </p>
<p>
  [242] Pointedly, there is no restriction on who might make the payment or deposit 
  the security to obtain the release of the aircraft, and there is no exception 
  or procedure provided to legal titleholders to claim and take possession of 
  their aircraft. </p>
<p>
  [243] I see no basis upon which the property interests of lessors or other titleholders 
  - interests that are implicated by the words that provide for the seizure and 
  detention of aircraft - can be excluded from the purview of the words that provide 
  for the release of the aircraft. In the CANSCA the words "until the charge 
  is paid" are part of the very same sentence that provides for initial seizure 
  and detention. The earlier words of the sentence fit together with the later 
  words of the sentence to form one coherent whole. The words relating to seizure, 
  to detention, and to the release of the aircraft share the same scope of application. 
  Likewise, ss. 9(1) and 9(3) of the Airports Act are part of the same framework 
  for the regulation of the seizure, detention, and release of aircraft and share 
  the same scope of application. The CANSCA and the Airports Act, together with 
  the Aeronautics Act, comprise a complete regulatory scheme of the aeronautics 
  industry in Canada. This detailed comprehensive statutory framework does not 
  initially engage the property interests of titleholders, and then wordlessly 
  leave it to the courts to disengage those interests and release aircraft to 
  titleholders in apparent conflict with the expressly stated statutory requirements 
  for release. </p>
<p>
  [244] The Lessors point out that there are other federal statutes that provide 
  the right to sell seized property and that the Detention Provisions do not. 
  They also point out that similar British legislation, the Civil Aviation Act 
  (1982) (U.K.), 1982, c. 16, affords United Kingdom airports the right to detain 
  and sell detained aircraft if charges are not paid. The Lessors argue that in 
  the absence of the right to sell the seized property, it cannot be concluded 
  that the Detention Provisions create liens. The argument, if I understand it 
  correctly and may paraphrase it, is that since Parliament did not interfere 
  with the titleholders' property rights by providing for the "detention 
  and sale" of seized aircraft, it may be concluded that Parliament did not 
  intend to interfere with their property rights by providing for the "detention" 
  of seized aircraft. </p>
<p>
  [245] I do not regard other federal legislation as pertinent because the issue 
  is not what Parliament might have provided, but what it in fact provided in 
  these statutes. These are statutory remedies and I do not consider it necessary 
  in construing them to attempt to fit them into a previously recognized class 
  or category of property right. I see nothing in their terms to indicate an intention 
  to assimilate pre-existing common law concepts. Their location in a detailed 
  and complete regulatory scheme of inter-related statutes implies otherwise. 
  </p>
<p>
  [246] While the Detention Provisions do not stipulate what occurs if outstanding 
  charges are not paid after the seizure and detention of aircraft, they do endow 
  the court with discretion to regulate the continued detention or release of 
  the aircraft. In this case we are not presented with a fact situation where 
  the court has made an order permitting seizure and detention, and a notable 
  period of time has passed without payment of the outstanding charges. The applications 
  before the motions judge did not seek the sale of the aircraft. In the case 
  before this Court, it is sufficient to say that the Detention Provisions permit 
  the Authorities (on court order) to seize and detain and not release the aircraft 
  until outstanding charges are paid or security provided. </p>
<p>
  [247] The British legislation highlights that interference with the property 
  rights of financiers of aircraft is not exceptional in the international aviation 
  industry. Section 88 of the Civil Aviation Act (1982) permits detention of aircraft, 
  and failing payment of the outstanding charges within 56 days, the sale of the 
  aircraft notwithstanding the property interests of titleholders who are not 
  the persons who owe the outstanding charges. Like the Canadian provisions, s. 
  88 is silent on who might pay the outstanding charges. On a practical level, 
  Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C in Bristol Airport plc v. Powdrill, [1990] 
  Ch. 744 (C.A.) at 756 observed that the "powers under the section provide 
  a strong inducement to those ultimately interested in the aircraft to discharge 
  the debts the airport charges, even though they have not incurred them". 
  Facing the prospect of such "strong inducement" to pay the debts of 
  others is a part of the commercial reality of financiers of aircraft that fly 
  into the United Kingdom. Indeed, the British legislation applied to any aircraft 
  of the Canada 3000 Companies that flew there. </p>
<p>
  [248] The Canadian Detention Provisions do not address any right to sell detained 
  aircraft and hence have no reason to stipulate the priorities of distribution 
  of the proceeds upon a sale. But the prospect that titleholders' aircraft in 
  Canada may be seized, detained and not released until outstanding charges are 
  paid is sufficient to furnish the titleholders with a strong inducement to pay 
  the outstanding charges even though they have not incurred them. </p>
<p>
  [249] This reading of the Detention Provisions is entirely in keeping with their 
  statutory context. Parliament took the day-to-day operation and management of 
  civil air navigation services and of some airports "off the government 
  books" by transferring them to self-funded, not-for-profit entities intended 
  to be financially viable. These entities provide essential services of a public 
  nature that are used for profit by those with business interests in the aviation 
  industry. Consistent with the expectation that owners are ultimately responsible 
  for the use of their property, Parliament supported the independent financial 
  viability of the new entities by providing an additional remedy for the collection 
  of unpaid charges, namely a "strong inducement" to titleholders of 
  aircraft to pay or deposit security for outstanding charges incurred by the 
  authorized use of their property. </p>
<p>
  [250] Given the high mobility and interchangeability of aircraft, it is understandable 
  that the Detention Provisions do not connect a seized aircraft to the specific 
  charges incurred in respect of that particular aircraft. However, the Detention 
  Provisions vest the court with discretion to supervise the detention and release 
  of aircraft and thus ensure overall fairness. </p>
<p>
  [251] As I regard the words of the Detention Provisions to be unambiguous, I 
  do not find resort to extrinsic evidence necessary in construing them. In any 
  event, I do not regard Parliamentary proceedings as providing insight into the 
  meaning of the Detention Provisions. As Cronk J.A. reviews, the Detention Provisions 
  were presented to the House of Commons and to the Senate as replicating or being 
  substantially the same as the powers of the Minister of Transport to seize and 
  detain aircraft under the Aeronautics Act. </p>
<p>
  [252] I reproduce section 4.5 of the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-2, in 
  full, noting that we were not taken to it during the hearing of the appeal. 
  Section 4.5 was in force at the time the Detention Provisions were before Parliament 
  and remains in force: </p>
<p class="indent">
  4.5 (1) Where the amount of any charge and interest thereon due by a person 
  that has been imposed under section 4.4 has not been paid, the Minister may, 
  in addition to any other remedy available for the collection of the amount and 
  whether or not a judgment for the collection of the amount has been obtained, 
  on application to the superior court of the province in which any aircraft owned 
  or operated by the person is situated, obtain an order of the court, issued 
  on such terms as the court deems necessary, authorizing the Minister to seize 
  and detain the aircraft. </p>
<p class="indent"> Idem </p>
<p class="indent"> (2) Where the amount of any charge and interest thereon due 
  by a person that has been imposed under section 4.4 has not been paid and the 
  Minister has reason to believe that the person is about to leave Canada or take 
  from Canada any aircraft owned or operated by the person, the Minister may, 
  in addition to any other remedy available for the collection of the amount and 
  whether or not a judgment for the collection of the amount has been obtained, 
  on ex parte application to the superior court of the province in which any aircraft 
  owned or operated by the person is situated, obtain an order of the court, issued 
  on such terms as the court deems necessary, authorizing the Minister to seize 
  and detain the aircraft. </p>
<p class="indent"> Release on payment </p>
<p class="indent"> (3) Subject to subsection (4), except where otherwise directed 
  by an order of a court, the Minister is not required to release from detention 
  an aircraft seized under subsection (1) or (2) unless the amount in respect 
  of which the seizure was made is paid. </p>
<p class="indent"> Release on security </p>
<p class="indent"> (4) The Minister shall release from detention an aircraft seized 
  under subsection (1) or (2) if a bond or other security in a form satisfactory 
  to the Minister for the amount in respect of which the aircraft was seized is 
  deposited with the Minister. </p>
<p>
  [253] As can be seen, the Minister may apply to the court for an order authorizing 
  the seizure and detention of "any aircraft owned or operated" by a 
  person who has not paid charges imposed under s. 4.4 of the Aeronautics Act. 
  Unless the court directs otherwise, the Minister is not required to release 
  from detention an aircraft that has been seized unless the amount in respect 
  of which the seizure was made is paid. </p>
<p>
  [254] Certainly, the Detention Provisions are aptly described as substantially 
  the same as the powers of the Minister under the Aeronautics Act. However, in 
  the absence of any judicial interpretation of the Minister's powers under s. 
  4.5 of the Aeronautics Act, that description is of limited assistance in the 
  construction of the Detention Provisions. It may be observed that the model 
  for the Detention Provisions was designed as an additional remedy to assist 
  the Crown to collect unpaid charges imposed for government provided services. 
  </p>
<p>
  [255] For these reasons, I conclude that Authorities who have properly seized 
  and detained aircraft under the Detention Provisions do not have to release 
  the aircraft, unless otherwise directed by the court, until their outstanding 
  charges are paid or satisfactory security is deposited notwithstanding the property 
  interests in the aircraft. The remedy is "in addition to any other remedy 
  available for the collection" of the outstanding charges. The remedy is 
  not confined to collection of outstanding charges from persons liable for the 
  charges. The remedy is not directed to persons at all, but rather to "aircraft", 
  and permits the Authorities, under court supervision, to seize, to detain and 
  to refuse to release the aircraft until somebody has satisfied the outstanding 
  charges. </p>
<p>
  [256] My conclusion that Authorities do not have to release seized aircraft 
  until their outstanding charges are paid or satisfactory security is deposited, 
  notwithstanding the property interests in the aircraft, applies to sublessors 
  who have subleased aircraft to the registered owners or operators. The Ansett 
  Lessors submitted in their factum that: "Canada 3000 was the undisputed 
  operator and registered owner of all three aircraft it leased or subleased from 
  the Ansett Lessors and those aircraft were in the exclusive possession and control 
  of Canada 3000 at the time the charges were incurred and at the time Nav Canada 
  brought its application". These admitted facts are sufficient to support 
  an application to seize and detain the aircraft until all charges have been 
  paid. </p>
<p>
  [257] The Engine Lessors submitted that an engine is a removable and identifiable 
  object that does not form an integral part of the aircraft as it can be easily 
  removed without damage to the aircraft. The Engine Lessors relied on s. 202.13 
  of the Canadian Aviation Regulations, S.O.R./1996-433 ("CARS"), that 
  indicates a hang glider is considered to be an aircraft, to argue that an engine 
  is not included within the meaning of "aircraft" in the statutory 
  scheme. They argued that engines on aircraft are interchangeable like tires 
  on a car. </p>
<p>
  [258] I do not find helpful the observation that a glider is an aircraft. Under 
  the CARS a helicopter is also considered an aircraft, but one would not expect 
  to hear the argument that wings are not part of an aircraft. In point of fact, 
  there are different classifications of aircraft under the CARS, one of which 
  is "aeroplane". Section 101.01(1) of the CARS defines "aeroplane" 
  as "a power-driven heavier-than-air aircraft that derives its lift in flight 
  from aerodynamic reactions on surfaces that remain fixed during flight". 
  It seems to me that the statutory scheme recognizes an engine as part of an 
  aeroplane. </p>
<p>
  [259] The issue, as I see it, is whether the particular aircraft that is the 
  subject of a seizure and detention application has engines. This case concerns 
  aeroplanes not gliders.</p>
<p>
  [260] I would find that a seizure and detention of aircraft authorized under 
  the Detention Provisions would include any engines affixed to the airframes 
  of such aircraft, and the Authorities would not have to release the engines 
  until the outstanding charges were paid, unless so directed by the court. </p>
<p>
  [261] I would allow the appeals of NAV Canada and the Airport Authorities of 
  the dismissal of their seizure and detention motions, and remit them to the 
  motions judge to be dealt with according to the interpretation of the Detention 
  Provisions set out in these reasons. </p>
<p>
  [262] I would also set aside the order of the motions judge that NAV Canada 
  and the Airport Authorities reimburse the owner/Lessors for costs incurred in 
  connection with the detention of the aircraft and the posting of security as 
  it was premised on the dismissal of the applications of NAV Canada and the Airport 
  Authorities based on what I regard as an incorrect interpretation of the Detention 
  Provisions. I would remit this question to the motions judge to deal with when 
  considering the applications afresh. </p>
<p>
  [263] I have not addressed argument of the Lessors, Gecas and Pegasus, that 
  the Authorities' right to apply to the court for an order permitting them to 
  seize and detain aircraft "owned or operated" by the Canada 3000 Companies 
  terminated upon their bankruptcy, or the argument of the remaining Lessors that 
  "As of the Date of the Bankruptcy, all efforts to execute against or seize 
  the property of Canada 3000 and Royal were superceded by the bankruptcy". 
  These submissions presume that, as certain of the Lessors argued in their factum, 
  the motions judge "erred in determining that the bankruptcy of Canada 3000 
  and Royal had no effect on the rights of NAV Canada and the Airport Authorities" 
  and erred in determining that "the leases fell outside of the estate of 
  the bankrupts". </p>
<p>
  [264] No appeal was taken, however, of these findings of the motions judge. 
  The facts of the case before us are that the leases do not form part of the 
  Bankrupts' estates, and that the Authorities' seizure and detention claims are 
  not affected by the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
  Act, R.S.C. 1985 c. B-3. Nor are the Authorities' applications affected by the 
  stay order under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36, 
  as that order was terminated on November 30, 2001 before the seizure and detention 
  motions were argued. </p>
<p>
  [265] In this case the only statutory requirement for the Authorities' applications 
  under the Detention Provisions is that the "aircraft" be "owned 
  or operated by the person liable to pay" outstanding charges. None of the 
  Lessors advanced an argument that the aircraft were not "owned or operated" 
  by the Canada 3000 Companies. In fact, Canada 3000 was registered as the "owner" 
  of all the aircraft. Counsel for the group of Lessors that filed a joint factum 
  conceded in argument that the Canada 3000 Companies operated the aircraft and 
  that the aircraft were subject to initial seizure by the Authorities, although 
  he went on to argue that once seized, the aircraft had to be released to the 
  Lessors when they asserted their pre-existing property rights. </p>
<p>
  [266] In summary: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1. I would dismiss the appeal of NAV Canada against the motion judge's ruling 
  that the Lessors are not liable under s. 55 of the CANSCA for outstanding navigation 
  charges owed by the Canada 3000 Companies for civil air navigation services 
  for the reasons given by Cronk J.A.</p>
<p class="indent"> 2. I would allow the appeal of NAV Canada and the Airport Authorities 
  of the dismissal of their seizure and detention applications and remit those 
  applications to the motions judge to be dealt with in accordance with these 
  reasons. I would also allow the appeal of NAV Canada and the Airport Authorities 
  of the ruling requiring them to reimburse the Lessors/owners for their Detention 
  Costs. The issue of any costs would be before the motions judge on the reconsideration 
  of the motions to seize and detain.</p>
<p class="indent"> 3. I would allow the appeal of NAV Canada and the GTAA of the 
  ruling that the Engine Lessors are entitled as a matter of right to repossess 
  the leased engines.</p>
<p class="indent"> 4. Lastly, I would dismiss: </p>
<p class="indent">
  the appeal of certain of the Lessors from the motion judge's holding that the 
  Authorities could claim interest on the outstanding charges;</p>
<p class="indent"> the Airport Authorities' appeal of the motion judge's determination 
  of when interest on outstanding airport charges ceases;</p>
<p class="indent"> the cross-appeal of the Lessors from the motion judge's decision 
  denying them their costs of the proceeding before him; and</p>
<p class="indent"> the appeal of certain of the Lessors of the motion judge's 
  ruling that each party should bear its own costs of compliance with the release 
  protocols, regardless of the ultimate disposition of the seizure and detention 
  motions. </p>
<p class="indent"> These are all matters within the discretion of the motions 
  judge to determine and he could reassess the manner in which he exercises his 
  discretion in the context of his disposition of the remitted applications to 
  seize and detain. </p>
