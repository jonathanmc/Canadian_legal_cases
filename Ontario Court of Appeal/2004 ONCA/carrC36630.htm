<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the conviction for attempted murder in relation to Dimitre 
  Dimitrov cannot stand. The sole issue on that count was the appellant's intent 
  at the time of the stabbing. In that regard, there was evidence from Ms. Gottwald 
  that when the stabbing occurred, the appellant was very drunk and/or stoned, 
  he was engaged in a struggle with the victim and he was lying on the floor with 
  the victim on top of him.</p>
<p>
  [2] That body of evidence was relevant to the appellant's state of mind at the 
  time of the stabbing. If believed, it may have left the jury in a state of reasonable 
  doubt as to whether the appellant, in an intoxicated and highly emotional state, 
  intended to kill the victim. </p>
<p>
  [3] Unfortunately, the trial judge did not instruct the jury along these lines. 
  Instead, he simply reminded the jury of the defence position that if the appellant 
  had really wanted to kill the victim, he could have done so when the victim 
  was lying helpless on the front lawn of Ms. Gottwald's residence after the attack.</p>
<p>
  [4] With respect, that instruction was insufficient in the circumstances. It 
  failed to adequately convey the appellant's defence of "lack of intent" 
  to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [5] Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction for attempted 
  murder and order a new trial on that count, as well as the counts charging the 
  appellant with aggravated assault and assault with a weapon in relation to Mr. 
  Dimitrov. The trial judge entered a conditional stay in respect of the latter 
  two counts following the appellant's conviction for attempted murder. The Crown 
  is entitled to have the appellant retried on all three counts.</p>
<p>
  [6] In addition to being convicted of attempted murder in relation to Mr. Dimitrov, 
  the appellant was also convicted of aggravated assault in relation to Ms. Gottwald. 
  The two incidents were closely related and the trial judge imposed an eight-year 
  sentence on the aggravated assault charge to be served concurrently with the 
  eight-year sentence he imposed on the charge of attempted murder.</p>
<p> [7] Although the appellant appealed from his conviction on the aggravated 
  assault charge relating to Ms. Gottwald, he did not pursue the matter in oral 
  argument and his appeal from that charge is accordingly dismissed.<a name="r1"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a></p>
<p>
  [8] Standing alone, the sentence for aggravated assault on Ms. Gottwald, which 
  was incidental to the attack on Mr. Dimitrov, was excessive.</p>
<p>
  [9] The parties agree that the eight-year sentence imposed on that charge should 
  be reduced to four years. We accept their joint submission.</p>
<p>
  [10] Accordingly, in respect of the charge of aggravated assault against Ms. 
  Gottwald, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed and the 
  sentence of eight years is reduced to four years. The sentence imposed by the 
  trial judge on an unrelated charge of assault involving Ms. Gottwald (count 
  6) has not been appealed and it remains the same (six months consecutive).</p>
<p> Signed: "M. Rosenberg J.A."<br>
  "M.J. Moldaver J.A."<br>
  "J. Simmons J.A."</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> We note that in his Notice of Appeal, 
  the appellant appealed from the following convictions: (1) attempted murder; 
  (2) aggravated assault; (3) assault with a weapon; and (4) break and enter. 
  To the extent that the first three convictions relate to Mr. Dimitrov, the conviction 
  for attempted murder is quashed and the conditional stays on the charges of 
  aggravated assault and assault with a weapon are set aside and a new trial is 
  ordered in relation to the three offences. If, however, the aggravated assault 
  charge and assault with a weapon charge refer to Ms. Gottwald, the conviction 
  for aggravated assault stands, as does the conditional stay entered on the charge 
  of assault with a weapon. As for the break and enter conviction, we know of 
  no such conviction. Accordingly the appeal from that conviction is quashed.</p>
