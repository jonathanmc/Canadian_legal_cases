<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice George T. Valin of the Superior 
  Court of Justice on December 5, 2002 and the sentences imposed on December 5, 
  2002.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>[1] The appellant was charged with forcible entry, forcible confinement and 
  assault and two counts of breach of a non-contact clause contained in his recognizance 
  of bail. He was convicted on the assault and breach of recognizance charges 
  and acquitted of the remaining charges. He was sentenced to a total of ten months 
  incarceration, less ten months credit for pre-trial detention, resulting in 
  a sentence of one-day incarceration on each of his three convictions, to be 
  followed by twelve months probation. He appeals his convictions on the assault 
  charge and on one of the breach of recognizance charges, as well as the sentences 
  imposed.</p>
<p>
  (1) BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [2] This case arises from a series of altercations between the appellant and 
  his then fianc&eacute;e on the night of December 11, 1999. The background facts 
  are somewhat unusual.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant and the complainant are both police officers on the same police 
  force in Pembroke, Ontario. In the months preceding the relevant incidents, 
  they were involved in a domestic relationship and had been living together in 
  the complainant's home. They had also become engaged to be married. However, 
  the relationship was fragile and at times appears to have been turbulent.</p>
<p>
  [4] In May 1999, the appellant was suspended from work and subsequently charged 
  with uttering threats against his former wife's boyfriend. At about the same 
  time, the complainant took a three-month leave of absence from work due to stress. 
  During this period, both parties increased their consumption of alcohol beyond 
  the levels that previously had been normal for them. Sometime in the late summer 
  or early fall of 1999, when the complainant read the Crown disclosure brief 
  relating to the threatening charge against the appellant, she became very upset 
  and the relationship between the parties deteriorated. This culminated in a 
  request by the complainant in early November 1999 that the appellant move out 
  of her house. Although the appellant did so, he continued to see the complainant 
  and, on occasion, to spend the night with her at her home. </p>
<p>
  [5] On the night of December 7, 1999, the appellant and the complainant became 
  involved in a lengthy argument while at the complainant's house. The complainant 
  had been drinking heavily earlier in the evening and, during the course of the 
  argument, she struck the appellant in the face and head several times, injuring 
  her hand in the process. When the appellant obtained a bag of ice for her hand, 
  the complainant struck him in the face with it and kicked him in the lower back 
  with her foot. The appellant did not retaliate. Instead, he left the complainant's 
  house and returned to his parents' home.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant and the complainant saw each other socially on December 10, 
  1999 and again during the afternoon on December 11, 1999. Both occasions were 
  uneventful.</p>
<p>
  [7] On the evening of December 11, 1999, the appellant and the complainant went 
  out to dinner with two other couples. The complainant again consumed large quantities 
  of alcohol. Nothing untoward happened during the dinner or subsequently, when 
  all three couples returned to the complainant's house for a nightcap. When the 
  other two couples left the complainant's house at about 11:30 p.m., the complainant 
  and the appellant went to bed, intending to spend the night together. However, 
  they again became involved in an argument, which caused the appellant to get 
  dressed and leave the complainant's house. After a short time, the appellant 
  changed his mind and returned. </p>
<p>
  [8] When the appellant arrived at the complainant's house, he knocked loudly 
  on the door. The complainant came downstairs and unlocked the door. She alleged 
  that the appellant then forced his way into the house. A physical confrontation 
  ensued in the hallway and the kitchen. The complainant claimed that the appellant 
  pushed her onto the floor and, when he decided that she should go to bed, attempted 
  to force her upstairs. The complainant vigorously resisted by sitting down on 
  the floor, grasping the handrail of the staircase leading to the bedroom, and 
  positioning herself between the wall and the banister so that the appellant 
  was prevented from moving her. The complainant testified that she pushed her 
  head back so far that she dented the wall with her head. She alleged that the 
  appellant persisted notwithstanding her efforts to resist him and that, ultimately, 
  he succeeded in picking her up and taking her upstairs. According to the complainant, 
  the fighting continued once they were in the bedroom. She said that the appellant 
  threw her on the bed onto her back and then straddled her by sitting on top 
  of her chest. She stated that the appellant then attempted to choke her and 
  to smother her with a pillow while forcibly confining her in the bedroom.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant presented a starkly different version of events in his trial 
  testimony. </p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant acknowledged returning to the complainant's house after their 
  argument but said that the complainant let him into the house without opposition. 
  He claimed that, in her inebriated state, she then assaulted him. After an altercation 
  in the kitchen, the appellant told the complainant that she was drunk again 
  and that she needed to sleep and to go upstairs and calm herself. He claimed 
  that, thereafter, he attempted to guide the complainant to the stairs, whereupon 
  the complainant fell down on the floor at the foot of the staircase. She braced 
  herself against the wall, grasped one of the handrails, and repeatedly smashed 
  her head against the wall with sufficient force that the wall was damaged. </p>
<p>
  [11] The appellant claimed that he continued in his attempts to take the complainant 
  upstairs because he thought that she was having a breakdown and feared that 
  she would hurt herself if she continued to strike the wall with her head. He 
  wanted her to calm down, to stop banging her head against the wall, and to refrain 
  from striking him, as she had done a few nights earlier. He testified that when 
  he picked the complainant up from the floor, she fought with him, clawing at 
  his face and scratching his eye.</p>
<p> [12] Eventually, the appellant succeeded in carrying the complainant to her 
  bedroom. He put her on the bed and, when she tried to continue fighting, he 
  held her down on the bed, lying on top of her, to calm her down and to keep 
  her from hitting him. He denied striking the complainant or attempting to choke 
  or smother her. He claimed that, at the time, he was in love with the complainant 
  and was still engaged to marry her. He also said that when the complainant rose 
  from the bed, she swallowed a handful of pills. When the appellant attempted 
  to remove them from her mouth, the complainant bit his fingers. Shortly thereafter, 
  the complainant ran from the house to the neighbours, claiming that the appellant 
  had assaulted her and attempted to choke and smother her.</p>
<p>
  [13] As a result of these events, the appellant was charged with forcible entry, 
  forcible confinement and assault. The complainant was not charged with any offence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [14] When the appellant was subsequently released on bail, the terms and conditions 
  of his recognizance of bail required that he not communicate with the complainant, 
  directly or indirectly. Contrary to this requirement, the appellant entered 
  into a brief conversation with the complainant on January 12, 2000 when he encountered 
  her sitting in her parked car on the street. The complainant immediately reported 
  the contact to a senior officer on the police force. At trial, the appellant 
  maintained that the complainant was not on duty during this encounter. </p>
<p>
  [15] The appellant alleged that the complainant lured him into this contact 
  by rolling down the window of her car, initiating a conversation with him and 
  inviting further discussion. He also claimed that on other occasions the complainant 
  had tried unsuccessfully in various ways to involve him in a breach of his recognizance, 
  including parking her police cruiser at work in a place that required the appellant 
  to pass her on his way into the police station, driving to his parents' home 
  and pulling her vehicle into their driveway, and driving past the appellant 
  on the street when he was walking his dog.</p>
<p>
  [16] Within days of his discussion with the complainant on the street, the appellant 
  telephoned her at work, claiming to be someone else in order to speak with her. 
  This incident gave rise to the second breach of recognizance charge against 
  the appellant. He does not appeal his conviction on that charge.</p>
<p>
  (2) ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [17] The appellant makes three arguments in support of his conviction appeal. 
  First, he asserts that the trial judge erred by rejecting the defence of necessity 
  with respect to the assault charge. Second, also in connection with his assault 
  conviction, he submits that the trial judge erred by not applying the principle 
  of "de minimus non curat lex" to ground an acquittal on the assault 
  charge. Third, with respect to his challenged breach of recognizance conviction, 
  the appellant maintains that the trial judge erred by rejecting his defence 
  of entrapment. </p>
<p>
  [18] On his sentence appeal, the appellant argues that, in the particular circumstances 
  of this case, the trial judge erred by failing to grant an absolute or conditional 
  discharge.</p>
<p>
  (3) CONVICTION APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [19] We did not find it necessary to call on the Crown in respect of the conviction 
  appeal. In our view, the appellant's challenges of his assault and breach of 
  recognizance convictions may be dealt with summarily. </p>
<p>
  (a) Assault Conviction</p>
<p>
  [20] The assault of which the appellant was convicted concerns the events that 
  transpired at the base of the stairs in the complainant's home as the appellant 
  was attempting to get the complainant upstairs to her bedroom.</p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant submits that, in rejecting the defence of necessity, the 
  trial judge misapprehended the evidence and failed to consider relevant evidence. 
  He says that both errors tainted the trial judge's reasoning process, resulting 
  in an unreasonable conviction for assault. He asserts that the complainant was 
  in imminent peril because she was smashing her head against the wall with such 
  force that she broke the wall, and that his actions were designed to prevent 
  this peril. The trial judge said that the appellant, "did not express any 
  fear or concern about any injury the complainant might cause to herself when 
  she was at the bottom of the stairs. His evidence was that he wanted her to 
  go upstairs to go to sleep". This was contrary to the appellant's evidence. 
  In fact, the appellant testified that "He didn't want her to hurt herself", 
  that he "didn't want her to keep banging her head in the wall" and 
  that he was trying to take care of the complainant, "To get her up, quit 
  banging her head in the wall and get her to sleep". He was also concerned 
  that the complainant was having a breakdown. </p>
<p>
  [22] Notwithstanding that the trial judge misapprehended the appellant's evidence 
  in this regard, we are satisfied that the defence of necessity could not succeed. 
  Three requirements must be present for the defence of necessity to be raised: 
  (i) imminent peril or danger; (ii) no reasonable legal alternative to the course 
  of action undertaken; and (iii) proportionality between the harm inflicted and 
  the harm avoided: R. v. Latimer (2001), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at para. 28 (S.C.C.). 
  The standard that governs is a modified objective test, which takes into account 
  the situation and characteristics of the particular accused. As the Supreme 
  Court stated in Latimer at para. 33: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The accused person must, at the time of the act, honestly believe, on reasonable 
  grounds, that he faces a situation of imminent peril that leaves no reasonable 
  legal alternative open [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  See also: R. v. Perka (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p> [23] In this case, although the appellant may honestly have believed that 
  he faced a situation of imminent peril, he did not testify that he believed 
  he had no legal alternative open to him. Having regard to the objective component 
  of the test, alternatives were open to the appellant: for example, he could 
  simply have backed away from the complainant and waited to see if she stopped 
  banging her head; alternatively, he could have attempted to place something 
  behind the complainant's head to cushion the blows. Thus, even if the trial 
  judge misapprehended the evidence with respect to the first element relating 
  to the defence of necessity, a requisite component of the defence was not made 
  out.</p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant submits, in the alternative, that the trial judge's decision 
  is contrary to the principle of "de minimus non curat lex", that 'the 
  law does not concern itself with trifles': see R. v. Hinchey, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 
  1128. This principle seeks to avoid the criminalization of harmless conduct 
  by preventing the conviction of those who have not really done anything wrong. 
  The application of the principle goes only so far as to preclude the criminalization 
  of conduct for which there is no reasoned apprehension of harm to any legitimate 
  personal or societal interest: R. v. Murdock (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 232 (Ont. 
  C.A.). The appellant acknowledges that this argument was not raised at trial, 
  but submits that this court has a complete evidentiary record on which to deal 
  with the issue. </p>
<p>
  [25] We would not give effect to this submission. Hinchey dealt with the acceptance 
  of a benefit by a public servant. In that case, the Supreme Court of Canada 
  explicitly did not decide on the applicability of the de minimus principle as 
  a defence to criminal culpability. Murdock concerned trafficking in a controlled 
  substance. Neither case involved the use of force or domestic violence. The 
  extent of injuries resulting from the use of force, while an important factor, 
  is not the sole determinative of the personal or societal interest in a crime. 
  The harm to society occasioned by domestic violence, even of a minor nature, 
  cannot be understated.</p>
<p>
  [26] The appellant also submits that, on the findings of the trial judge, the 
  complainant was guilty of assault concerning the sequence of events that transpired 
  immediately after the appellant's return to her home and, again, in respect 
  of the events in her bedroom. He correctly points out that the trial judge found 
  that the complainant was the aggressor during the altercation in the bedroom. 
  Moreover, the trial judge expressly rejected the complainant's version of events 
  in the bedroom as not credible or reliable. Thus, her allegations of choking, 
  smothering and forcible confinement were rejected. In our view, these considerations 
  are more appropriately factors for consideration on the appellant's sentence 
  appeal. They do not displace the fact of the appellant's conduct at the foot 
  of the stairs in the complainant's home, or afford a defence to that conduct.</p>
<p>
  [27] Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal concerning the appellant's conviction 
  for assault.</p>
<p>
  (b) Breach of Recognizance Conviction</p>
<p>
  [28] The appellant appeals his conviction for his January 12, 2000 breach of 
  his recognizance on the basis that he was entrapped by the complainant. He submits 
  that the proceedings concerning this charge should have been stayed as an abuse 
  of process. </p>
<p>
  [29] We disagree. For entrapment to apply, the court must conclude that the 
  appellant was convicted of an offence that was the work of the state. In the 
  circumstances of this case, the complainant's status as a police officer is 
  not itself sufficient to support this conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [30] Accordingly, we would also dismiss the appeal relating to the appellant's 
  conviction for breach of recognizance.</p>
<p>
  (4) SENTENCE APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [31] The defence argues that the appellant ought to be granted either an absolute 
  or conditional discharge. According to defence counsel, the appellant's exemplary 
  record as a police officer, the fact that he served five months of pre-trial 
  incarceration, the extreme stigma that he suffered in the community given the 
  nature of the allegations against him, the relatively minor nature of the assault, 
  and his difficult pre-trial incarceration in protective custody, are all factors 
  that militate towards some form of discharge. Moreover, the full context of 
  the assault suggests that the appellant was not trying to hurt the complainant 
  but, rather, was attempting to protect her, and himself, from further harm.</p>
<p>
  [32] The Crown submits that the appellant should be sentenced to a further period 
  of incarceration, two years of probation, a non-contact order with the complainant, 
  a firearm prohibition, and a DNA order. The Crown argues that the appellant's 
  criminal record is an aggravating factor. It further asserts that the circumstances 
  of the assault indicate that the appellant's conduct was not spontaneous. Finally, 
  the Crown asserts that since violent conduct in the domestic context and disobedience 
  to court orders through breaches of recognizance need to be deterred through 
  proper sentencing, a discharge in this case would be contrary to the public 
  interest.</p>
<p>
  [33] In fashioning an appropriate sentence in this case, it was important that 
  the totality of the circumstances and the full context of the events on the 
  night in question be considered. In our view, the trial judge erred by failing 
  to do so.</p>
<p>
  [34] The trial judge found that the complainant inflicted serious injury on 
  the appellant. In contrast, the injuries to the complainant were minor. These 
  findings support the appellant's version of the full sequence of events leading 
  up to and following the assault on the staircase.</p>
<p>
  [35] The trial judge also made serious adverse findings concerning the complainant's 
  credibility. In acquitting the appellant of the forcible entry and forcible 
  confinement charges, the trial judge rejected the complainant's evidence concerning 
  many of the key events in question. In addition, and significantly, the trial 
  judge rejected the complainant's claim that she was assaulted by the appellant 
  in the hallway of her home, in the kitchen and in the bedroom. Indeed, in connection 
  with the altercation in the bedroom, the trial judge held that the complainant 
  was the aggressor. </p>
<p>
  [36] The trial judge also held that on a number of prior occasions when the 
  appellant was assaulted by the complainant, he did not retaliate but, rather, 
  walked away. On this occasion, the trial judge found that the complainant was 
  intoxicated and was behaving somewhat irrationally. That finding is supported 
  by the complainant's conduct in persistently banging her head against the wall 
  and by her aggression against the appellant in the bedroom.</p>
<p>
  [37] The trial judge correctly observed that there is a societal interest in 
  seeking to deter domestic violence and to protect the victims of domestic violence. 
  In this case, however, the trial judge also found that the appellant was a victim 
  of domestic violence. </p>
<p>
  [38] The sentencing judge rejected certain of the Crown's submissions concerning 
  sentence on the basis that they would have an unnecessarily harsh impact on 
  the appellant's prospects to continue his employment as a police officer. This 
  is a legitimate factor, among others, to be taken into account at a sentence 
  hearing. Neither the appellant's personal interest nor the societal interest 
  would be served by the imposition of a sentence, not otherwise warranted, that 
  would preclude the appellant's continued employment as a police officer.</p>
<p>
  [39] When the unique circumstances of this case are considered, we do not agree 
  that a sentence of incarceration was warranted. The trial judge's reasons do 
  not suggest that there is a need for specific deterrence and the entry of a 
  conviction against the appellant on the charges at issue on this appeal may 
  have significant negative repercussions for him. As well, the appellant has 
  already served the equivalent of a ten-month custodial sentence. The courts 
  have recognized that in those unusual cases where the granting of some form 
  of discharge is in the best interests of the accused and is not contrary to 
  the public interest, sentencing relief is available: see R. v. Sanchez-Pino 
  (1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 53 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. McDowell, [1980] O.J. No. 488 
  (C.A.). This is such a case.</p>
<p>
  (5) DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [40] For the reasons given, this is an appropriate case for the grant of a conditional 
  discharge. Accordingly, the convictions on the charges at issue are set aside, 
  findings of guilt are substituted in their stead, and a conditional discharge 
  is granted with probation for twelve months on the terms imposed by the trial 
  judge. </p>
