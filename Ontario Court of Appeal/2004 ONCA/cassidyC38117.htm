<p>BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] On July 4, 2001, the respondent was charged with five counts of possession 
  of child pornography. The charges were based in large part on material which 
  the police retrieved from computer hard drives in the respondent's possession 
  by using two software programs known as ENCASE and DIGIT. This appeal concerns 
  the extent of disclosure of electronic information to which the respondent is 
  entitled in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p>
  [2] The relevant facts are quite simple. Four of the five charges against the 
  respondent arise directly from the materials consisting of image files on the 
  hard drives of the computers owned or used by the respondent. They were extracted 
  by the police using the two software programs. Both programs are covered by 
  copyright, although the Crown has not raised that as a consideration in this 
  appeal. ENCASE is available commercially at a cost of about $2,500 U.S. Training 
  to use the program can be obtained for a further $2,000 U.S. DIGIT, however, 
  is a program developed for use in law enforcement and, while available to the 
  police, it cannot be purchased by members of the public. </p>
<p>
  [3] The Crown disclosed to the respondent the files which were the subject of 
  the charges by providing discs containing copies of the files in exactly the 
  same folders as they were found in the various hard drives. However, the Crown 
  refused to provide either access to or copies of the full hard drives or the 
  two software programs.</p>
<p>
  [4] As a result, the respondent sought an order, pursuant to s. 24(1) of the 
  Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, for production and disclosure of copies 
  of both the hard drives and the two software programs. </p>
<p>
  [5] On December 17, 2001, Epstein J. concluded that both the hard drives and 
  the two software programs were relevant and necessary for the respondent to 
  make full answer and defence and that there was no reason why the disclosure 
  sought cannot or should not be provided. She therefore ordered that the Crown 
  provide the respondent with copies of the hard drives, and both software programs 
  and, if required, all reasonable costs of training to use the ENCASE program.</p>
<p>
  [6] On March 28, 2002 the Crown advised the trial judge that it would not be 
  complying with this order and therefore consented to the respondent's application 
  to stay all five charges. The same day, the trial judge made the stay order 
  requested.</p>
<p>
  [7] In this court, Mr. Hutchison for the Crown, who was not counsel below, argued 
  that the disclosure order below went too far and that the stay should be set 
  aside and a new trial ordered. However, in this court, its position was considerably 
  different from the one taken before the trial judge. Before us, the Crown did 
  not seek to contend that the respondent should not have access to the hard drives 
  and the two software programs as part of his disclosure entitlement. Nor could 
  such a position have been successfully maintained in the circumstances of this 
  case.</p>
<p>
  [8] Rather, the Crown agreed with the respondent that he should be provided 
  with access to the hard drives by receiving true copies of those hard drives. 
  The only difference between the parties at the commencement of argument in this 
  court concerned access to the two software programs and it too was a much narrower 
  difference than at first instance. By the conclusion of argument that difference 
  had essentially vanished.</p>
<p>
  [9] The Crown proposed to provide access to the respondent by allowing counsel 
  or his expert to attend at the police premises and, in privacy, apply the two 
  software programs to the respondent's copies of the hard drives.</p>
<p>
  [10] For his part, counsel for the respondent was prepared to live with this 
  proposal, and did not strenuously press his request made below for copies of 
  the two programs. Nor did he argue that his expert needed the ENCASE training 
  and was entitled to receive it at the Crown's expense.</p>
<p>
  [11] We agree that in this case the proper disclosure order is that the Crown 
  provide copies of the hard drives to the respondent and access on the basis 
  proposed to the two software programs used to retrieve the material which is 
  the subject of these charges.</p>
<p>
  [12] This will allow the defence to replicate in privacy the process used by 
  the police to obtain the material underpinning the charges and to explore other 
  matters that might reasonably be relevant to making full answer and defence, 
  such as the context in which the material was found, or the dates on which it 
  was saved to the hard drives.</p>
<p>
  [13] It is unnecessary for the Crown to go beyond that to purchase copies of 
  the programs for the respondent or to pay for training the respondent's expert 
  in their use. The evidence does not suggest that either step would permit the 
  accused to do anything with the hard drives relevant to the defence that could 
  not be done with the disclosure proposal now being made by the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [14] We suspect that an order similar to the one we would propose will be sufficient 
  to ensure that the Crown meets its disclosure obligation in most cases involving 
  electronic information. However, if there are cases in which the Crown's disclosure 
  obligation can be met only by providing the accused with copies of software 
  and the training to use it, that will be for the trial judge to consider when 
  those cases arise.</p>
<p>
  [15] We thus conclude that the disclosure order appealed from went too far in 
  the circumstances of this case. Since that order constitutes the foundation 
  for the consent order to stay the charges, the stay order itself cannot be sustained 
  on the basis upon which it was made.</p>
<p>
  [16] However, the Crown has still not made the disclosure constitutionally required 
  of it and were the trial to proceed we would have to make an order for disclosure 
  in the terms we have described.</p>
<p>
  [17] Our task, then, is to determine whether the appropriate order is to substitute 
  the proper disclosure order and direct a new trial, as contended for by the 
  Crown, or, as argued by the respondent, to conclude that the interests of justice 
  now require that the proceedings be stayed. We conclude that the latter is the 
  proper course, and in the circumstances the charges against the respondent should 
  continue to be stayed. </p>
<p>
  [18] We are faced with a most unusual situation. The Crown now accepts that 
  the position it took before the trial judge was wrong and did not fulfil its 
  disclosure obligations. The respondent accepts that the position advanced by 
  the Crown for the first time in oral argument on appeal does afford adequate 
  disclosure. We agree. There was nothing to prevent the Crown from taking this 
  position two years ago before the trial judge. Instead, it maintained what it 
  now concedes was an erroneous position and launched an appeal which resulted 
  in a two year delay in the proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [19] This court has recognized in several cases that the Crown is not entitled 
  to appeal immediately from every adverse legal ruling it gets in the course 
  of a trial. It can bring the trial to a close and launch an appeal, if the adverse 
  ruling makes the continuation of the proceeding fruitless from the Crown's perspective. 
  As Martin J.A. said in R. v. Banas and Haverkamp (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 224 
  (C.A.) at 230: </p>
<p class="indent">
  We do not think that the Crown, in the circumstances, is precluded from appealing 
  the directed verdict because Crown counsel decided not to continue with the 
  trial which he considered would be fruitless and which would not result in a 
  conviction due to the erroneous exclusion of vital evidence. We are satisfied 
  that if the trial Judge had not excluded the evidence of the intercepted private 
  communications the verdict of the jury would not necessarily have been the same. 
  However we wish to point out that if in a particular case we considered that 
  Crown counsel had unreasonably declined to present substantial evidence in his 
  possession which would support a conviction merely in order to appeal an adverse 
  ruling on the admissibility of evidence, we would not hesitate to hold that 
  the Crown in those circumstances was precluded from appealing an acquittal. 
  We are, however, satisfied that this is not what occurred here [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [20] In R. v. Power (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) L'Heureux Dub&eacute; 
  J. for the majority brought Banas and similar cases within the purview of the 
  abuse of process doctrine as it applies in the context of Crown appeals from 
  acquittals or an equivalent order such as a stay of proceedings. She said this 
  at p. 12: </p>
<p class="indent">
  However, had the conduct of the Crown in those cases been such that a stay of 
  proceedings would have been warranted, as Martin J.A. seems to infer in his 
  obiter dicta in Banas, supra, it might very well be that the court would have 
  found an abuse of process. It may well be that a Court of Appeal might find 
  abuse of process in a case where the Crown refuses to continue a trial, despite 
  sufficient evidence to found a verdict, for the sole purpose of obtaining an 
  interlocutory appeal on an adverse ruling. Such an appeal would not be available 
  to the accused in the parallel situation, and the accused would be forced to 
  undergo an unnecessary second trial. As such, a case might be made that the 
  Crown's conduct constitutes an unfair and abusive exercise of the prosecutorial 
  discretion conferred upon it.</p>
<p>
  [21] In this case, the respondent sought disclosure two years ago. The Crown 
  refused to respond adequately, taking a position that clearly fell short of 
  its constitutional requirement. It maintained that position until argument in 
  this court, when it altered that position to one that recognized the Crown's 
  constitutional obligation. It sought an order from this court in those terms, 
  and the respondent essentially consented. Two years ago, instead of revising 
  its position to that it now acknowledges to be constitutionally mandated, the 
  Crown chose to appeal. Had it not altered its position in argument in this court, 
  its appeal surely would have failed. However, had it adopted its current position 
  two years ago, rather than pursuing this appeal, the trial would in all likelihood 
  have proceeded two years ago.</p>
<p>
  [22] We see a strong analogy between a Crown decision to proceed immediately 
  to appeal when it has substantial other evidence available to it, and the Crown 
  decision to proceed immediately to appeal when it has available to it an alternative 
  order that would satisfy its disclosure obligations and obviate the need for 
  an appeal. In both cases the accused is exposed to a potentially unnecessary 
  appeal. Indeed, the present situation is worse, given that the Crown now concedes 
  that the position it took at trial was wrong. To be blunt, regardless of the 
  position of the defence, the Crown should have rethought its position on disclosure 
  two years ago at trial instead of on the eve of the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [23] In our view, it would be an unfair and abusive exercise of prosecutorial 
  discretion to allow the Crown to force the respondent to a new trial now. It 
  maintained a disclosure position that is clearly constitutionally inadequate 
  for two years, during which the respondent has been free of the criminal justice 
  system, when, had it done then what it now recognizes to be required of it, 
  the respondent's trial could have proceeded two years ago.</p>
<p>
  [24] Thus, in the result, we find that, albeit for different reasons, the stay 
  of these charges is appropriate. The appeal is therefore dismissed. While the 
  respondent requests an order for costs, we see no basis for doing so here.</p>
