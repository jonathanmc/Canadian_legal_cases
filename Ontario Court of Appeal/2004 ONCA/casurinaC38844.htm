<p>On appeal from a judgment of Justice James M. Spence of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated August 22, 2002.</p>

<p>
  FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellants are holders of convertible debentures of the respondent Rio 
  Algom Limited. They complain that they were oppressed by the respondents, Rio 
  Algom and its directors, and Billiton plc and its directors and Billiton Copper 
  Holdings Inc., when Billiton made a successful takeover bid for all the shares 
  of Rio Algom, whereupon the shares were delisted, rendering the convertible 
  feature of the debentures of no further value. The oppression claim was dismissed 
  by Spence J. based on the terms of the trust indenture that governs the debentures. 
  In my view, Spence J. made no error in his analysis of the oppression application, 
  and I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [2] The history of the takeover is described in detail in the reasons of Spence 
  J., [2002] O.J. No. 3229 (Sup. Ct.). I will only outline the history briefly 
  in order to discuss the issues raised on the appeal.</p>
<p>
  The Takeover Bid by Billiton</p>
<p>
  [3] In response to Noranda Inc.'s accumulation of Rio Algom shares in 1999 and 
  2000 with a view to a takeover of the company, the board of directors of Rio 
  Algom looked for an alternative bidder and entered into negotiations with Billiton 
  around August 2000. On August 22, 2000, Noranda announced its intention to make 
  an all cash offer for all the shares of Rio Algom at $24.50 per share. In response, 
  Billiton offered $27.00 per share for all of the shares, and Rio Algom agreed 
  to recommend that offer to its shareholders and to waive the application of 
  its shareholders rights plan.</p>
<p> [4] In its takeover bid circular, Billiton stated: (1) the purpose of the 
  offer was to acquire all of the common shares of Rio Algom; (2) it intended 
  to exercise its statutory right under the Ontario Business Corporations Act, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, if available, to acquire all of the common shares not 
  deposited on the offer;<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> and (3) once Billiton 
  began to take up the offered shares, the liquidity and market value of the remaining 
  shares could be adversely affected as the shares could be delisted by the Toronto 
  Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange if the minimum listing requirements 
  were not being met.</p>
<p>
  [5] On October 3, 2000, Noranda announced that it would not top Billiton's offer, 
  leaving Billiton free to complete its bid. On October 6, 2000, Billiton announced 
  that ninety-five per cent of Rio Algom's common shares had been deposited, that 
  it would forthwith take up and pay for the shares, and that it was extending 
  its bid to October 16, 2000. On November 29, 2000, Rio Algom announced that 
  as of that date, Billiton had acquired by compulsory acquisition the balance 
  of Rio Algom's common shares and that its shares would no longer be listed on 
  the TSE or the NYSE. As Spence J. found, this was the inevitable result of the 
  successful completion of the takeover bid.</p>
<p>
  Terms of the Trust Indenture</p>
<p>
  [6] In 1997, Rio Algom issued convertible debentures for a ten-year term pursuant 
  to a prospectus and governed by the terms of a trust indenture dated February 
  4, 1997. The prospectus and the trust indenture set out the terms governing 
  the debentures including the rights and obligations of the issuer, of the debenture 
  holders and of the trustee under the indenture. </p>
<p>
  [7] The debentures are convertible into common shares during the ten-year term 
  at the option of the debentureholder at the price of $40 per common share. </p>
<p>
  [8] Rio Algom was given the right to redeem the debentures prior to their maturity, 
  but subject to the following restrictions: (1) the debentures were not redeemable 
  before February 1, 2000; (2) between February 1, 2000, and January 31, 2002, 
  the debentures were redeemable at par only if the average trading price of the 
  common shares of Rio Algom was equal to 125 per cent of the conversion price; 
  and (3) on or after February 1, 2002, the debentures were redeemable at par 
  regardless of the trading price of the common shares.</p>
<p>
  [9] Rio Algom covenanted with the trustee for the benefit of the trustee and 
  the debentureholders that it would ensure that while the debentures were outstanding, 
  the corporation would maintain its status as a reporting issuer and not be in 
  default of any securities legislation requirements that would adversely affect 
  its ability to issue common shares or the debentureholders' ability to trade 
  its common shares after conversion, and that the debentures and common shares 
  would be listed at the time of issue on the TSE or another Canadian stock exchange.</p>
<p>
  [10] Section 9 of the trust indenture required Rio Algom to protect the rights 
  of the debentureholders in the event of a merger with another company or acquisition 
  by another company, but with the caveat that the protection of rights was not 
  required in the event of &quot;any sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially 
  all the property of the Corporation in the ordinary course of its business.&quot; 
  Spence J. found that this caveat applies to an acquisition of all of the shares 
  of the company pursuant to a takeover bid. </p>
<p>
  [11] Finally, s. 7 of the trust indenture defines &quot;Events of Default&quot; 
  and provides for the consequences of default by Rio Algom. The failure to observe 
  or perform any covenant is an event of default if it continues for sixty days 
  following written notice by the trustee to the company. Where there is a continuing 
  event of default, the trustee may in its discretion and shall if so required 
  by debentureholders' resolution, give notice to the corporation declaring the 
  principal and accrued interest under the debentures due and payable to the trustee 
  to be distributed to the debentureholders, and take court action to enforce 
  the obligations of the corporation. Section 7.5 provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> 7.5 Enforcement by the Trustee</p>
<p class="indent">If an Event of Default shall have occurred, but subject to section 
  7.4 and to the provisions of any Extraordinary Resolution that may be passed 
  by the Debentureholders as hereinafter provided and subject to section 12.3: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) The Trustee (either in its own name or as trustee of an 
  express trust, or as attorney-in-fact for the Debentureholders, or in any one 
  or more of such capacities), may in its discretion proceed to enforce the rights 
  of the Trustee and of the Debentureholders by any action, suit, remedy or proceeding 
  authorized or permitted by this Indenture or by law or equity; and may file 
  such proof of debt, amendment of proof of debt, claim, petition or other papers 
  or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of 
  the Trustee and of the Debentureholders filed in any bankruptcy, insolvency, 
  winding-up or other judicial proceedings relating to the Corporation or its 
  creditors or relating to or affecting its property;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the Trustee is hereby irrevocably appointed (and the successive 
  Holders of Debentures by taking and holding the same shall be conclusively deemed 
  to have so appointed the Trustee) the true and lawful attorney-in-fact of the 
  respective Debentureholders with authority to make and file in the respective 
  names of the Debentureholders or on behalf of the Debentureholders as a class, 
  subject to deduction from any such claims of the amounts of any claims filed 
  by any of the Debentureholders themselves, any proof of debt, amendment of proof 
  of debt, claim, petition or other papers or documents in any such proceedings 
  and to receive payment of any sums becoming distributable on account thereof, 
  and to execute any such other papers and documents and to do and perform any 
  and all such acts and things for and on behalf of such Debentureholders, as 
  may be necessary or advisable in the opinion of the Trustee, in order to have 
  the respective claims of the Trustee and of the Debentureholders against the 
  Corporation or its property allowed in any such proceeding, and to receive payment 
  of or on account of such claims; provided, however, that nothing contained in 
  this Indenture shall be deemed to give to the Trustee, unless so authorized 
  by Extraordinary Resolution, any right to accept or consent to any plan of reorganization 
  or otherwise by action of any character in such proceeding to waive or change 
  in any way any right of any Debentureholder; </p>
<p class="indent">(c) no such remedy for the enforcement of the rights of the 
  Trustee or the Debentureholderes shall be exclusive of or dependent on an other 
  such remedy but any one or more of such remedies may from time to time be exercised 
  independently or in combination;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) all rights of action hereunder may be enforced by the Trustee 
  without the possession of any of the Debentures, or the production thereof on 
  the trial or other proceedings relating thereto; and may in its discretion proceed 
  to enforce the rights of the Trustee and of the Debentureholders by any action, 
  suit, remedy or proceeding authorized or permitted by this Indenture or by law 
  or equity;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) Upon receipt of a Debentureholders' Request, the Trustee 
  shall exercise or take such one or more of such remedies as the Debentureholders' 
  Request may direct provided that if any such Debentureholders' Request directs 
  the Trustee to take proceedings out of court the Trustee may in its discretion 
  take judicial proceedings in lieu thereof.</p>
<p>
  [12] Importantly, s. 7.6 entitled &quot;Debentureholders May Not Sue&quot; (the 
  &quot;no-action&quot; clause) provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  No Debentureholder shall have the right to institute any action, suit or proceeding 
  or to exercise any other remedy authorized or permitted by this Indenture or 
  by law or by equity for the purpose of enforcing payment of principal or interest 
  owing on any Debenture or for the execution of any trust or power hereunder, 
  unless: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) such Holder shall previously have given to the Trustee 
  written notice of the occurrence of an Event of Default;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the Debentureholders, by Extraordinary Resolution, shall 
  have made a request to the Trustee to take action hereunder or the Debentureholders' 
  Request referred to in section 7.3 shall have been delivered to the Trustee, 
  and the Trustee shall have been offered a reasonable opportunity either itself 
  to proceed to exercise the powers hereinbefore granted or to institute an action, 
  suit or proceeding in its name for such purpose;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the Debentureholders or any of them shall have furnished 
  to the Trustee, when requested by the Trustee, sufficient funds and an indemnity 
  in accordance with subsection 12.3(2); and</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the Trustee shall fail to act within a reasonable time thereafter.</p>
<p class="indent">In such event but not otherwise, any Debentureholder acting 
  on behalf of himself and all other Debentureholders, shall be entitled to take 
  proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction such as the Trustee might 
  have taken under section 7.5, but in no event shall any Debentureholder or combination 
  of Debentureholders have any right to take any other remedy or proceedings out 
  of court; it being understood and intended that no one or more of the Debentureholders 
  shall have any right in any manner whatsoever to enforce any right hereunder 
  or under any Debenture except subject to the conditions and in the manner herein 
  provided, and that all powers and trusts hereunder shall be exercised and all 
  proceedings at law shall be instituted, had and maintained by the Trustee, except 
  only as herein provided, and in any event for the equal benefit of all Holders 
  of outstanding Debentures.</p>
<p>
  Negotiations with the Debentureholders</p>
<p>
  [13] Billiton, together with its legal and financial advisors, had concluded 
  based on the terms of the trust indenture, that the debentureholders' only entitlement 
  was to be redeemed at par, because that was what they would be entitled to in 
  the event of a default by Rio Algom if they called the debentures due. Billiton 
  expected that when the Rio Algom shares were delisted, the debentureholders' 
  remedy under the trust indenture would be to cause notice of an event of default 
  to be given and to eventually have their debentures redeemed at par. In mid-October 
  2000, Billiton offered to immediately redeem the convertible debentures at par 
  without waiting for the sixty-day notice to be given, through an amendment to 
  the trust indenture. Although the largest debentureholder and one other large 
  institutional holder were prepared to accept the offer, that was not sufficient 
  for the two-thirds majority required to amend the trust indenture and the redemption 
  did not proceed.</p>
<p>
  Transfer of Rio Algom Subsidiaries to Billiton</p>
<p>
  [14] Following the completion of the takeover of Rio Algom by Billiton, on December 
  15, 2000, Rio Algom announced that it would transfer its interest in two wholly-owned 
  subsidiaries, NAMD and Atlas Ideal Metals Inc., to wholly-owned subsidiaries 
  of Billiton. These two subsidiaries represented approximately one quarter of 
  Rio Algom's assets. </p>
<p>
  [15] The price paid by Billiton to Rio Algom for the two subsidiaries of U.S. 
  $410 million was made up of U.S. $60 million cash and U.S. $350 million by way 
  of a debt instrument with a coupon bearing interest at LIBOR (London InterBank 
  Offered Rate) plus three-quarters of one per cent. Although it was originally 
  intended that this transaction would be subject to an independent valuation 
  and the approval of a committee of independent directors of Rio Algom, Billiton 
  refused to comply with the committee's requests that it provide a letter of 
  credit to secure its guarantee of the Rio Algom loan and enter into a unanimous 
  shareholder agreement approving the transaction. Billiton also moved its shares 
  in Rio Algom outside Ontario in order to avoid compliance with the type of valuation 
  required by O.S.C. Policy 61.501. The committee ultimately required Billiton 
  to approve the transaction through a unanimous shareholder resolution. </p>
<p>
  The Position of the Appellants</p>
<p>
  [16] The appellants did not seek to have the trustee call the debentures due 
  based on the default of Rio Algom in allowing the delisting of its shares. Instead 
  they brought an application for an oppression remedy against the respondents. 
  Based on their interpretation of the trust indenture and of the prospectus, 
  their position was that it was a reasonable expectation of the debentureholders 
  that: (1) so long as the debentures were outstanding, the common shares of Rio 
  Algom would always remain listed; (2) there would be no redemption of the shares 
  by Rio Algom prior to February 2002 unless the debentureholders could instead 
  elect to convert, then sell the common shares and receive a twenty-five per 
  cent premium over par; and (3) Rio Algom was prohibited from entering into a 
  merger or acquisition without protecting the conversion rights of the debentureholders. 
  Therefore, by participating in the takeover by Billiton, which resulted in the 
  delisting of its shares, Rio Algom breached its covenant that the shares would 
  remain listed on the TSE. That breach was an event of default. It was also conduct 
  that unfairly disregarded the interests of the debentureholders because it effectively 
  removed their conversion privilege, a key component of the original value of 
  the debentures. </p>
<p>
  [17] The appellants' position was that because of the oppressive conduct of 
  Rio Algom and its directors, they were not limited to their contractual remedy 
  under the trust indenture based on the default, but were entitled to be compensated 
  for the loss of the conversion privilege. Had the company not been able to force 
  early redemption, it would only have been able to redeem between February 2000 
  and February 2002 if the debentureholders could receive a premium of twenty-five 
  per cent over par. They sought redemption at that rate on the basis that the 
  share price would have reached the required level during that time period. It 
  did not lie in the mouths of the respondents to suggest that the Rio Algom share 
  price would not have reached the needed level when it was the delisting of the 
  shares as well as the denuding of the assets of Rio Algom that prevented the 
  Rio Algom shares from achieving that value. </p>
<p>
  [18] The appellants sought to invoke the oppression remedy as against the Billiton 
  respondents on the basis that once Billiton acquired ninety-five per cent of 
  the Rio Algom shares it became an affiliate of Rio Algom and responsible under 
  the oppression remedy for conduct that affected the interests of the debentureholders 
  in Rio Algom.</p>
<p>
  THE FINDINGS OF SPENCE J.</p>
<p>
  [19] A. The Takeover and Resulting Delisting of the Shares did not Constitute 
  Oppression by Rio Algom or Billiton</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Section 9 of the trust indenture which deals with mergers 
  and acquisitions by another company and requires that the rights of the debentureholders 
  be preserved in those events, has no application to a takeover bid followed 
  by a forced acquisition of the shares of the corporation. The corporation cannot 
  be in default where it is not a party to the transaction, which is between the 
  acquirer and the shareholders.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) There is no provision in the trust indenture agreement that 
  obliged Rio Algom to obtain compensation or other protection for the debentureholders 
  in the event of a takeover of all the shares for the loss of their conversion 
  privilege. Such a protective feature could have been included but was not. </p>
<p class="indent">(3) The trust indenture provides for the eventuality of the 
  delisting of the shares by making it an event of default and providing a remedy: 
  the debentures may be called immediately due and payable at par. That distinguishes 
  this case from Highfields Capital I LP v. Telesystem International Wireless 
  Inc. (2002), 21 B.L.R. (3d) 133 (Ont. Sup. Ct.), and Deutshe Bank Canada v. 
  Oxford Properties Group Inc. (1998), 40 B.L.R. (2d) 302 (Ont. Sup. Ct.), where 
  the court gave an oppression remedy when the events that occurred were not provided 
  for in the respective trust indentures.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Because the trust indenture provides for both the listing 
  of the shares and for the consequences of delisting, it was not unfair for the 
  takeover and forced acquisition to be carried out without any further protection 
  of the conversion interests of the debentureholders than their rights contained 
  in the indenture.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) The fact that the prospectus refers to a shareholder protection 
  rights plan in the event of a takeover bid is further evidence that the debentureholders 
  could not have had a reasonable expectation that a takeover and consequent delisting 
  of the shares could not happen.</p>
<p class="indent">(6) As there was no impairment of the rights of the debentureholders 
  under their indenture, no case of unfairness was made out.</p>
<p class="indent">(7) Billiton's actions in acquiring the balance of the shares 
  after it became an affiliate of Rio Algom did not constitute unfair disregard 
  of the interests of the debentureholders. Billiton never had a relationship 
  with the debentureholders. It was exercising its rights to acquire shares from 
  shareholders as a third party to Rio Algom and not in any dealings with it. 
  The debentureholders could not have had a reasonable expectation about a third 
  party's actions in buying shares of Rio Algom.</p>
<p>
  [20] B. The Transfer of the Rio Algom Subsidiaries to Billiton was Oppressive 
  to the Debentureholders</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Although the delisting of the shares made the conversion 
  right impractical (and both sides agreed, virtually worthless), it still had 
  some value or potential value. That value was adversely affected by removing 
  assets that would have augmented the share value of Rio Algom.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Because the transaction was done on the approval of Billiton, 
  the purchaser, it was thus a case of self-dealing and the onus was on Billiton 
  to show that the transfer of the subsidiaries was in the best interests of Rio 
  Algom. The transfers were done without the approval of the independent committee 
  of the board and without the letter of credit the committee requested. The valuation 
  obtained by Billiton was not in accordance with Ontario Securities Commission 
  requirements and therefore does not meet the onus. As a result, the transfer 
  of the subsidiaries to Billiton constituted conduct that unfairly disregarded 
  the interests of the debentureholders.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The remedy the debentureholders would be entitled to would 
  depend on the value of the debentures. None of the valuation evidence accepted 
  by the court put the value over par. However, the court accepted the appellants' 
  argument that the proper relief was to compensate the appellants for the loss 
  of their reasonable expectation that they could only have been redeemed between 
  February 2000 and February 2002 if they received a twenty-five per cent premium 
  over par.</p>
<p>
  [21] C. The &quot;No-Action&quot; Clause, s. 7.6 of the Trust Indenture, Bars 
  Oppression Claims by Individual Debentureholders</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Section 7.5 of the indenture authorizes the trustee to sue 
  only where there has been an event of default. In that case, the trustee sues 
  on behalf of all debentureholders for any remedy including an oppression remedy.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Under s. 7.6, the &quot;no-action&quot; clause, the debentureholders 
  are precluded from bringing proceedings to enforce payment of principal or interest 
  or for the execution of any trust or power under the debenture without first 
  seeking to have the trustee act. If the trustee does not act within a reasonable 
  time, then &quot;[i]n such event&quot;, the debentureholders may sue, but only 
  on behalf of all debentureholders, and for any remedy that the trustee could 
  have sought under s. 7.5 including the oppression remedy. Therefore, the no-action 
  clause does not deprive the debentureholders of the benefit of the oppression 
  remedy.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Section 7.6 goes on to provide: &quot;[B]ut in no event 
  shall any Debentureholder or combination of Debentureholders have any right 
  to take any other remedy or proceedings out of court&quot;. Spence J. rejected 
  the appellants' submission that these words refer back to &quot;[i]n such event&quot; 
  and mean that in the event that the trustee fails to act, the debentureholders 
  are only precluded from seeking an extrajudicial remedy, but are not precluded 
  from suing for an oppression remedy. He held that the words mean that the debentureholders 
  can never sue for any remedy except for the remedies available to the trustee 
  under s. 7.5 if the conditions set out in s. 7.6 are met, nor may they seek 
  any extrajudicial remedy. The balance of s. 7.6 provides that except as provided, 
  the trustee is to bring all actions and they are to be for the equal benefit 
  of all debentureholders.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The no-action clause therefore precluded the action by the 
  appellants against Rio Algom and its directors.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) Neither s. 7.5 nor s. 7.6 is limited by its terms to actions 
  against the issuer only. Both the trustee's right to sue under s. 7.5 upon an 
  event of default, and the no-action provision in s. 7.6 that allows the debentureholders 
  to sue in lieu of the trustee where the trustee fails to do so and precludes 
  any other action by the debentureholders, are not limited to actions against 
  Rio Algom but apply to actions against anyone. To confirm that conclusion, ss. 
  7.5 and 7.6 must be considered in the context of the other relevant provisions 
  of the trust indenture. Section 12.11 of the trust indenture gives the trustee 
  the general power to take all legal proceedings &quot;as it may consider necessary 
  or expedient to preserve, protect or enforce its interests and the interests 
  of the Debentureholders.&quot; Also, s. 7.11 provides that all remedies given 
  to the trustee or debentureholders are cumulative and &quot;in addition to every 
  other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing by law or by statute.&quot; 
  The no-action portion of s. 7.6 is worded very broadly and precludes debentureholders 
  from every type of action that the trustee may take, including the trustee's 
  broad powers under s. 12.11. Therefore, the no-action clause precluded the oppression 
  remedy action by the appellants not only against Rio Algom but also against 
  Billiton.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>
<p>(1) Did the application judge err in finding that the conduct of the respondents 
  in the takeover bid and the resulting delisting of the Rio Algom shares was 
  not oppressive to the appellants?</p>
<p>(2) Did the application judge err in his finding that the trust indenture precluded 
  the appellants from bringing an action for the oppression remedy, and that the 
  preclusion applied not only to an action against the issuer, Rio Algom, but 
  also against anyone, including Billiton?</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>The Standard of Review</p>
<p>
  [22] An appeal court is required to show deference to the decisions of trial 
  and application judges on questions of fact including the drawing of inferences 
  from facts, and on questions of mixed fact and law, and may only interfere if 
  the judge has made a &quot;palpable and overriding error&quot;. On questions 
  of law, the lower court must be correct, including where findings on issues 
  of mixed fact and law include an erroneous statement of the applicable law: 
  Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235.</p>
<p>
  Issue 1: Did Spence J. err in his Findings of No Oppression?</p>
<p>
  [23] The findings of the application judge on the issue of oppression address: 
  (a) the reasonable expectations of the debentureholders based on the terms of 
  the prospectus and of the trust indenture as well as the evidence of the events; 
  and (b) whether the actions of the respondents in not preserving the conversion 
  option and not securing more than compensation at par for the debentureholders 
  were fair to the debentureholders or unfairly disregarded their interests, assessed 
  in the same context. </p>
<p>
  [24] Whether the security holders had a reasonable expectation is a question 
  of fact: See Maple Leaf Foods Inc. v. Schneider Corp. (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 177 
  (C.A.) at 202; Arthur v. Signum Communications Ltd., [1993] O.J. No. 1928 (Div. 
  Ct.) at paras. 6-7. Similarly, whether the actions of a corporation unfairly 
  disregarded the interests of a security holder is also a question of fact. </p>
<p>
  [25] The appellants' position is based on the proposition that the essence of 
  a convertible debenture is the right to convert debentures into equity securities 
  and to be able to eventually realize a gain due to the potential appreciation 
  of the security. They submit that Spence J. erred by failing to find that the 
  conduct of both Rio Algom and Billiton, once it became an affiliate of Rio Algom, 
  was oppressive by allowing or facilitating the takeover bid when it had the 
  effect of creating a self-induced event of default by removing the appellants' 
  conversion rights.</p>
<p>
  [26] However, Spence J. considered and rejected these submissions by analyzing 
  the reasonable expectations of the debentureholders based on the terms of the 
  prospectus and of the trust indenture that govern the debentures. He concluded 
  that because the trust indenture provided that the event that occurred, namely 
  the delisting of the shares of the corporation, was an event of default, and 
  provided a remedy for that default, the debentureholders could not reasonably 
  have expected that a delisting could not occur. Or, they could not reasonably 
  have expected that if it did occur, they would be entitled to anything more 
  than the remedy bargained for in the &quot;documents of the deal,&quot; that 
  is redemption at par. He noted that the trust indenture could have included 
  a provision to provide special compensation to the debentureholders in the case 
  of a takeover bid, but it did not. As further evidence that the debentureholders 
  could not have expected that there could be no successful takeover bid, he noted 
  that the prospectus provided for a shareholders protection rights plan that 
  would be in effect in the event of a takeover bid and contemplates a &quot;Permitted 
  Bid&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [27] Spence J. also considered s. 9 of the trust indenture and the protection 
  it accords the debentureholders in the event of a merger or acquisition of the 
  corporation, but not in the event of a takeover. The appellants submit that 
  the caveat for a takeover only applies where the takeover is hostile, but not 
  where the company is co-operating with the acquirer, as in this case. This is 
  not a case of a voluntary transaction by Rio Algom. Spence J. recognized that 
  in this case there was going to be an acquisition of Rio Algom either by Noranda 
  or by Billiton. Once Rio Algom was &quot;in play,&quot; its legal obligation 
  was to try to maximize value for shareholders and it did that by co-operating 
  with Billiton. That co-operation was not equivalent to a voluntary merger or 
  sale undertaken by Rio Algom. </p>
<p>
  [28] Spence J. also addressed the relevant case law and distinguished the cases 
  relied on by the appellants. He distinguished his own decision in Highfields, 
  supra, where an oppression remedy was given to stop a bid that favoured some 
  security holders over others, but where the terms of the securities in question 
  did not provide for the consequences of what occurred. In Deutsche Bank, supra, 
  a provision in the prospectus regarding the conversion rights of debentures 
  was not included in the trust indenture. The court held that the conduct of 
  the company in materially changing the deal when negotiating the terms of the 
  indenture unfairly disregarded the interests of the debentureholders and constituted 
  oppression. Spence J. noted that there was no such discrepancy between the prospectus 
  and the trust indenture in this case. </p>
<p> [29] Spence J.'s analysis of the effect of the trust indenture is also consistent 
  with the decisions of the Divisional Court and of this court in Armstrong v. 
  Northern Eyes Inc., [2002] O.J. No. 1085 (C.A.), affirming (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 
  442 (Div. Ct.). In that case the shareholders agreement provided that the parties 
  would arbitrate disagreements and provided a valuation formula for any share 
  buyout. The shareholder wanted the court to assume jurisdiction over the dispute 
  and to apply the oppression remedy in order to achieve a more advantageous valuation 
  method. The court rejected the shareholder's action and held that the shareholders 
  had provided their own remedy. There was no basis to deviate from what they 
  had agreed to.<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> </p>
<p>
  [30] After analyzing the reasonable expectations of the debentureholders and 
  considering the case law, Spence J. concluded that the appellants were seeking 
  to rely on the provisions of the trust indenture that were favourable to their 
  case while ignoring the provisions that detracted from it. He rejected that 
  approach as unreasonable, and concluded that the conduct of the respondents 
  was not oppressive.</p>
<p>
  [31] There is no basis to interfere with those conclusions. There is no palpable 
  or overriding error and no error of law. The appellants effectively ask this 
  court to reject the analysis and conclusions reached by Spence J. and to substitute 
  the conclusion suggested by the appellants. </p>
<p>
  [32] In respect of Billiton's conduct in completing the takeover bid once it 
  was an affiliate of Rio Algom and therefore subject to the oppression remedy, 
  Spence J. relied on his conclusion that the debentureholders could not have 
  had a reasonable expectation that </p>

<p>
  if there were a successful takeover bid for Rio Algom and the shares were consequently 
  delisted, that they would be entitled to anything other than what was provided 
  for in the trust indenture. He also concluded that although Billiton became 
  an affiliate after it acquired ninety-five per cent of the Rio Algom shares, 
  when it completed the takeover by acquiring the balance of the shares from the 
  shareholders it did so based on statutory rights under the takeover provisions 
  of the OBCA. When it initiated the bid, it was a third party with no fairness 
  obligations to the debentureholders and furthermore, the debentureholders could 
  not have had reasonable expectations of the actions of a third party. </p>
<p>
  [33] Spence J. made no error in his analysis or conclusion that the debentureholders 
  could have no reasonable expectation of any greater compensation than that provided 
  for in the trust indenture for the breach of the indenture by the delisting 
  of the shares. To the extent that Billiton as an affiliate was responsible for 
  that default, there was no oppression. That was the factual finding by Spence 
  J. to which this court defers. The discussion of Billiton's status as a third 
  party is further obiter comment by the application judge and is unnecessary 
  to his conclusion. I see no need to deal further with it.</p>

<p>
  Issue 2: Did the Application Judge err in Concluding that the No-Action Clause 
  Precludes any Action by Individual Debentureholders Against Rio Algom and Billiton 
  Except Where the Trustee has Declined to act on an Event of Default?</p>
<p>
  [34] The construction of a written instrument is a question of mixed fact and 
  law: Petty v. Telus Corp. (2002), 164 B.C.A.C. 152 at para. 14, referring to 
  H.G. Beale, ed., Chitty on Contracts, 28 ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1998) 
  at paras. 12-043 and 12-046: </p>
<p class="indent">
  12-043 Intention of the parties. The task of ascertaining the intention of the 
  parties must be approached objectively: the question is not what one or other 
  of the parties meant or understood by the words used, but &quot;the meaning 
  which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background 
  knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation 
  in which they were at the time of the contract&quot;. The cardinal presumption 
  is that the parties have intended what they have in fact said, so that their 
  words must be construed as they stand. That is to say the meaning of the document 
  or of a particular part of it is to be sought in the document itself. &quot;One 
  must consider the meaning of the words used, not what one may guess to be the 
  intention of the parties&quot;. However, this is not to say that the meaning 
  of the words in a written document must be ascertained by reference to the words 
  of the document alone. In the modern law, the courts will, in principle, look 
  at all the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract which would 
  assist in determining how the language of the document would have been understood 
  by a reasonable man.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 12-046 Law and fact. The construction of written instruments 
  is a question of mixed law and fact. The expression &quot;construction&quot; 
  as applied to a document includes two things, first, the meaning of the words; 
  and, secondly, their legal effect, or the effect which is to be given to them. 
  Construction becomes a question of law as soon as the true meaning of the words 
  in which an instrument has been expressed and the surrounding circumstances, 
  if any, have been ascertained as facts. However, the meaning of an ordinary 
  English word, of technical or commercial terms and of latent ambiguities, and 
  the discovery of the surrounding circumstances (when they are relevant) are 
  questions of fact. </p>
<p class="indent">(Footnotes omitted.)</p>
<p>
  [35] The appellants submit that the trial judge erred in law because he did 
  not refer to principles of construction of contracts in his analysis of the 
  trust indenture. They say that the trust indenture is a contract of adhesion, 
  and that the doctrine of contra proferentem should be applied to interpret the 
  contract against the interests of Rio Algom in the event of an ambiguity. In 
  that regard they say that the application judge interpreted the indenture to 
  allow Rio Algom and Billiton to contract out of the oppression remedy and to 
  give the benefit of the contract to Billiton who is not a party to it.</p>
<p>
  [36] I would not give effect to these submissions. Spence J. approached the 
  construction of the trust indenture and of the no-action clause by considering 
  the words of the clause in the context of the indenture read as a whole and 
  of the purpose of the trust indenture: See Consolidated Bathurst Export Ltd. 
  v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance Co., [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888 at 901. He 
  gave the words the meaning he believed they bore in that context. He also tested 
  the meaning in the commercial context and concluded that there was nothing commercially 
  unreasonable about it: See Guarantee Co. of North America v. Gordon Capital 
  Corp, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 423 at para. 62. He considered and applied the case law 
  that considers the interpretation of trust indentures that govern convertible 
  debentures: Millgate Financial Corp. v. BF Realty Holdings Ltd. (1994), 15 B.L.R. 
  (2d) 212 (Ont. Gen. Div.); Feldbaum v. McCrory Corp., 1992 Del. Ch. LEXIS 113 
  (June 1, 1992); Highfields Capital, supra; Deutshe Bank, supra. </p>
<p>
  [37] The respondents point out that there is no basis to suggest that the trust 
  indenture is a contract of adhesion or that its terms were not negotiated as 
  part of the underwriting process at the time the debentures were issued. The 
  appellants, as purchasers of the debentures in the market, purchased the debentures 
  subject to the terms of the trust indenture. However, they had the opportunity 
  to consider their prospective purchase in the context of the terms governing 
  the debentures and on that basis must have made a decision whether to invest 
  or not. That is not a contract of adhesion.</p>
<p>
  [38] The appellants object that Spence J. did not follow the case of Millgate 
  Financial Corp., supra, where Farley J. interpreted a no-action clause (that 
  followed part of the wording of the no-action clause in this case) and limited 
  the extent of the clause in two ways: to actions to enforce the debenture and 
  not to oppression claims, and to actions against the issuer and not other parties. 
  Spence J. distinguished Millgate on the basis that the trust indenture in that 
  case did not contain the language in ss. 7.5 and 7.6 of the indenture in this 
  case that gives the trustee the power to assert an oppression claim where there 
  is an event of default and not only to claim redemption at par, and that gives 
  the debentureholders the power to sue for the same relief that the trustee could 
  have sought if the trustee fails to act. As well, in Millgate there was no final 
  blanket clause prohibiting any other action by debentureholders. In that regard, 
  Spence J. rejected the appellants' argument that the words &quot;in no event&quot; 
  must be read &quot;in no such event&quot;, saying that the reading suggested 
  by the appellants would change the meaning of the clause as written. </p>
<p>
  [39] On the question whether the no-action clause applies not only to actions 
  against the issuer where there is no language that limits it, but applies generally 
  to prohibit any actions except by the trustee on behalf of all debentureholders, 
  Spence J. referred to the Delaware Court of Chancery case of Feldbaum, supra, 
  where Chancellor Allen explained the rationale for a broad prohibition as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> I rather conclude only that, absent circumstances making application 
  of a no-action clause inappropriate such as those described above, courts systematically 
  conclude that, in consenting to no-action clauses by purchasing bonds, plaintiffs 
  waive their rights to bring claims that are common to all bondholders, and thus 
  can be prosecuted by the trustee, unless they first comply with the procedures 
  set forth in the clause or their claims are for the payment of past-due amounts.</p>
<p class="indent">Courts have implicitly concluded that this waiver by a bondholder 
  applies equally to claims against non-issuer defendants as to claims against 
  issuers. See Norte &amp; Co. v. Manor Healthcare Corp., Del. Ch., C.A. Nos. 
  6827, 6831, Berger, V.C. (Nov. 21, 1985) (dismissing for failure to comply with 
  a no-action clause breach of indenture claims against issuer and codefendants); 
  Levy v. Paramount Publix Corp., N.Y. Supr., 266 N.Y.S. 271, aff'd, N.Y. App. 
  Divl., 269 N.Y.S. 2d 997 (1934) (dismissing for failure to comply with a no-action 
  clause breach of fiduciary duty claims against issuer's directors in connection 
  with issuer's alleged fraudulent conveyance); Relmar Holding, 262 N.Y.S. 776[*26] 
  (dismissing for failure to comply with no-action clause fraudulent conveyance 
  claim against recipient of transferred assets).</p>
<p class="indent">The policy favoring the channelling of bondholder suits through 
  trustees mandates the dismissal of individual bondholder actions no matter whom 
  the bondholders sue. So long as the suits to be dismissed seek to enforce rights 
  shared ratably by all bondholders, they should be prosecuted by the trustee. 
  Moreover, like other no-action clauses, the clauses at issue here explicitly 
  make their scope depend on the nature of the claims brought, not on the identity 
  of the defendant. For example, the E-II clauses quoted earlier begin: &quot;A 
  Securityholder may not pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture of the 
  Securities unless &#133;&quot;</p>
<p>
  [40] Spence J. agreed with the rationale for giving a facially unlimited no-action 
  clause a broad interpretation. However, in light of Millgate and the arguments 
  of the appellants, he conducted a further analysis of the no-action clause read 
  together with the broad powers of the trustee contained in s. 12.11 of the indenture 
  before concluding, based on the wording of the indenture read as a whole, that 
  the clause prevents individual bondholders from bringing an oppression action 
  against the issuer or any other party.</p>
<p>
  [41] In my view, Spence J. made no error in his approach to the interpretation 
  of the trust indenture. His analysis and conclusion are reasonable and deserve 
  the deference of this court.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [42] In his reasons, Spence J. went on to deal with some matters that he described 
  as obiter in light of his finding that the no-action clause barred the within 
  action. These matters were based on his findings that the transfer by Billiton 
  of the two Rio Algom subsidiaries to itself, constituted oppressive conduct 
  by Billiton and that if there were to be a remedy, that the remedy would (or 
  might) be redemption at twenty-five per cent over par. The Billiton respondents 
  have argued on the appeal that the appellants' original application did not 
  suggest that the transfer of the subsidiaries constituted oppression but only 
  that it may have impaired Rio Algom's ability to honour its obligations to the 
  debentureholders and that in any event, Spence J. did not come to a definite 
  conclusion regarding the appropriate remedy.</p>
<p>
  [43] In light of the conclusion I have reached that the appeal must be dismissed, 
  it is unnecessary to address these issues raised by the respondents.</p>
<p>
  [44] In the result, I would dismiss the appeal with costs on the partial indemnity 
  scale. Counsel provided bills of costs following the oral hearing in this matter. 
  The appellants requested $176,762.19 (had they won), Rio Algom requested $101,096.99 
  and Billiton requested $75,135.21. This is a commercial matter with a significant 
  dollar amount at stake and where all parties are sophisticated investment entities. 
  The costs are fixed at $50,000 to each respondent inclusive of disbursements 
  and G.S.T.</p>
