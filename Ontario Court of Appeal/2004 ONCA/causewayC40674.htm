<p>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Justice R.T. Patrick Gravely, 
  Justice John A.B. Macdonald and Justice David Aston) dated April 28, 2003, reported 
  at [2003] O.J. No. 1640. </p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] This is a companion appeal to Ottawa Salus Corporation v. Municipal Property 
  Assessment Corporation and the City of Ottawa ("Salus"). Both appeals 
  relate to the exemption from property tax for charitable institutions found 
  in paragraph 12 of s. 3(1) of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. A.31: </p>
<p class="indent">
  12. Land owned, used and occupied by: </p>
<p class="center"> . . .</p>
<p class="indent"> iii. any charitable, non-profit philanthropic corporation organized 
  for the relief of the poor if the corporation is supported in part by public 
  funds.</p>
<p>
  [2] As in Salus, one issue in this appeal is the interpretation of the word 
  "occupied" in this provision. The second issue in this appeal relates 
  to the "supported in part by public funds" component of the exemption.</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  (1) The parties and events</p>
<p>
  [3] The Causeway Foundation ("the Foundation") is a charitable organization. 
  It owns a building in Ottawa at 22 O'Meara Street. It leases part of this building 
  to another charitable organization, the Causeway Work Centre ("the Work 
  Centre"). The Work Centre provides a program of living skills, occupational, 
  work and recreational activities, and counselling services to its members, who 
  are psychiatrically disabled adults. Ninety-seven per cent of the Work Centre's 
  members are estimated to live at or below the poverty line.</p>
<p>
  [4] The Foundation and the Work Centre share a somewhat complex history. In 
  1995, the building at 22 O'Meara Street was owned by a private company, 134688 
  Canada Inc. On December 15, 1995, the Work Centre entered into a lease with 
  134688 Canada Inc. for the building. The Work Centre wanted to purchase the 
  building, but the Ministry of Health, which provides 40 per cent of the Work 
  Centre's funding, refused to allow the use of operating funds for capital expenditures. 
  In order to circumvent this obstacle, a new organization, the Foundation, was 
  incorporated; the Foundation purchased the building from 134688 Canada Inc. 
  in 1998. 134688 Canada Inc.'s lease with the Work Centre was assigned to the 
  Foundation. Commercial subtenants occupy a small portion of the building. </p>
<p>
  [5] The Work Centre and the Foundation have a close relationship. There are 
  eight directors on the Foundation's board of directors; five of those directors 
  also sit on the Work Centre's board. The Foundation is exclusively restricted 
  in its corporate objects to assisting, promoting, and maintaining the Work Centre, 
  which carries out the charitable purposes of the Foundation. The Foundation 
  has assumed payment of the building's property taxes (which were previously 
  paid by the Work Centre), its insurance premiums, and its utilities payments. 
  The Foundation uses the rental payments it receives from the Work Centre to 
  cover these expenses, as well as the mortgage and repair and maintenance costs. 
  After all these payments are made, the Foundation gives whatever money is left 
  back to the Work Centre. </p>
<p>
  [6] In 2000, the Foundation applied for an order exempting the portion of the 
  building used by the Work Centre from property tax pursuant to s. 3(1), sub-paragraph 
  12(iii) of the Assessment Act. On June 20, 2002, Polowin J. dismissed the application: 
  [2002] O.J. No. 2482. As in Salus, which was released only a few days later, 
  Polowin J. found that the amended version of paragraph 12 required that the 
  legal entity which owned the subject property must itself occupy it. The lease 
  between the Foundation and the Work Centre granted exclusive possession of the 
  building to the Work Centre. The application judge rejected the Foundation's 
  contention that the two organizations are, in essence, one organization, noting 
  that they are separate legal entities by design. She concluded that the Foundation 
  did not "occupy" the portion of the building used by the Work Centre. 
  In addition, the application judge held that the Foundation was not supported 
  by public funds.</p>
<p>
  [7] The Foundation appealed. On April 28, 2003, the Divisional Court (Gravely, 
  Macdonald and Aston JJ.) dismissed the appeal: [2003] O.J. No. 1640. The court 
  said: </p>
<p class="indent"> In dismissing the claim for exemption, Polowin J. found on 
  the facts that while the appellant foundation is a charitable non-profit philanthropic 
  corporation organized for the relief of the poor, it failed to establish that 
  it occupies the land or that it is supported in part by public funds.</p>
<p class="indent">We are not satisfied that Polowin J. was clearly wrong in those 
  findings.</p>
<p>
  [8] The Foundation appeals the Divisional Court's decision.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUE</p>
<p>
  [9] There are two issues on appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Did the Divisional Court and the application judge err 
  in their interpretation of the word "occupied" in paragraph 12 of s. 3(1) of 
  the Assessment Act?</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Did the Divisional Court err by affirming the application 
  judge's conclusion that the appellant was not "supported in part by public funds"?</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) The occupation issue</p>
<p>
  [10] I adopt and incorporate my analysis of this issue in Salus.</p>
<p>
  [11] The Divisional Court rendered its decision in Salus on December 23, 2002. 
  The panel of the Divisional Court in the present case was aware of that decision. 
  It distinguished Salus in this fashion: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The facts which permitted the Divisional Court in Salus to distinguish the tenancy 
  cases do not exist here. Leasing to Causeway Work Centre is not the charitable 
  purpose of the appellant. Unlike the arrangement in Salus the appellant did 
  not control the land. Causeway Work Centre had total control over the property 
  pursuant to the lease. These two organizations were intended to be separate 
  entities. The applications judge found on the facts here that the appellant 
  had no occupancy rights and therefore no occupancy. In our view, it was open 
  to her to so find on this evidence.</p>
<p>
  [12] In this passage, the Divisional Court mentions four grounds for distinguishing 
  Salus. With respect, I do not think any of these grounds is convincing. I will 
  consider them in turn.</p>
<p>
  Leasing to the Work Centre is not the charitable purpose of the Foundation</p>
<p>
  [13] The Foundation listed its objects in Part III of its application for incorporation. 
  The application judge cited these objects: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The objects of the Corporation are: </p>
<p class="indent">
  "The establishment and operation of a charitable foundation which shall 
  raise funds and obtain donations for the purposes of: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) purchasing capital assets ("assets");</p>
<p class="indent">(b) funding research and/or special projects ("projects"); and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) funding specific and general education programs for the 
  general community with respect to mental illness and promoting the needs of 
  persons with mental illness ("programs"),</p>
<p class="indent">all of which assets, projects, and/or programs shall be used 
  exclusively in assisting, promoting and maintaining a group work program for 
  persons who are emotionally and/or mentally disordered and who are unable to 
  undertake regular employment and who are members from time to time of Causeway 
  Work Centre, a charitable not-for-profit corporation created pursuant to the 
  Corporations Act [R.S.O. 1990, c. C.38] or any successor corporation thereto."</p>
<p>
  [14] The subject property is an asset of the Foundation. The Foundation leases 
  this asset to the Work Centre in order to assist, promote and maintain the group 
  work program for members of the Work Centre. The Foundation does not lease this 
  asset for the purpose of profit; indeed, any money left over from the lease 
  payments after expenses have been paid is returned to the Work Centre. I conclude, 
  therefore, that the Foundation's leasing of the subject property to the Work 
  Centre does serve its charitable purposes.</p>
<p>
  Unlike the arrangement in Salus, the Foundation does not control the land</p>
<p>
  [15] Salus does have control over part of its properties - the offices and the 
  common rooms - but it has no right to regulate or control the tenants' units. 
  In Salus, the Divisional Court held that even though Salus had no right to regulate 
  or control the individual units, Salus nevertheless "occupied" those 
  units within the meaning of paragraph 12. Salus has no more control over the 
  residential units in its properties than the Foundation has over the O'Meara 
  Street building. I see no meaningful distinction between the cases on this ground.</p>
<p>
  The Foundation and the Work Centre were intended to be separate entities</p>
<p>
  [16] In Salus, prior to the 1995 Ministry of Health directive, Salus retained 
  the right to regulate and control the residential units in its buildings. In 
  the wake of the 1995 directive, Salus chose to lease those units to its tenants, 
  thereby ceding the right to regulate and control those units to separate legal 
  entities - the tenants themselves. Again, I do not see any meaningful distinction 
  between the two cases on this ground.</p>
<p>
  The application judge found on the facts here that the appellant had no occupancy 
  rights and therefore no occupancy</p>
<p>
  [17] In both Salus and the present case, the application judge held that the 
  charitable organization in question did not "occupy" the subject property 
  because the organization did not have the right to regulate and control that 
  property. In Salus, the Divisional Court held that the application judge erred 
  in her interpretation of the word "occupied" in paragraph 12. The 
  Divisional Court concluded that Salus "occupied" its subject properties 
  within the meaning of the paragraph because those properties were used and occupied 
  for the purpose of relieving the poor. The Foundation's building on O'Meara 
  Street is used and occupied for the purpose of relieving the poor. Again, there 
  is no meaningful distinction between the cases.</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [18] I conclude that the interpretation of the word "occupied" in 
  paragraph 12 of s. 3(1) of the Assessment Act must be the same in Salus and 
  in this appeal. Accordingly, the Foundation's first ground of appeal succeeds.</p>
<p>
  (2) The public funding issue</p>
<p>
  [19] Pursuant to sub-paragraph 12(iii) of s. 3(1) of the Assessment Act, in 
  order for a charitable institution to receive an exemption from property tax 
  it must be "supported in part by public funds". The application judge 
  held that the Foundation did not meet this requirement of the exemption: </p>
<p class="indent"> I turn finally to the issue of whether the Causeway Foundation 
  is supported in part by public funds. Counsel for the Applicant submitted that 
  the Causeway Foundation received its public funds indirectly from the Causeway 
  Work Centre in the form of rents received. Counsel relied in this regard on 
  the case of Re Cambridge Rehabilitation Homes [and City of Cambridge (1985), 
  49 O.R. (2d) 694 (Dist. Ct.)].</p>
<p class="indent">With the greatest respect, I do not agree with the interpretation 
  given by Justice Mossop that the exemption is satisfied if the public funds 
  are paid indirectly to the institution. Her comments with respect to this issue 
  were brief and do not appear to have been followed in any subsequent cases. 
  As noted above, one of the principles of statutory interpretation is that words 
  must be given their ordinary meaning. Section 3, paragraph 12 requires that 
  the entity be supported in part by public funds (counsel agree that this refers 
  to funds from government). Justice Mossop's interpretation, in essence, reads 
  words into the legislation that are not there, those words being "directly or 
  indirectly". I can see no legal justification for doing so. In my view, section 
  3, paragraph 12 requires that the Applicant receive funds from the government 
  and not from another organization or entity.</p>
<p>
  [20] The Divisional Court agreed with this analysis. In addition, the Divisional 
  Court rejected the Foundation's argument that the application judge failed to 
  deal with uncontradicted evidence that the Foundation received direct funding 
  from the federal government.</p>
<p>
  [21] The Foundation renews both of its submissions on this appeal. I will deal 
  with them in turn.</p>
<p>
  Indirect funding</p>
<p>
  [22] The case law is clear that the term "public funds" in sub-paragraph 
  12(iii) of s. 3(1) of the Assessment Act means funds received from a government 
  source, not from members of the public: see Ontario (Assessment Commissioner 
  Stouffville ) v. Mennonite Home Assn. of York (County), [1973] S.C.R. 189, and 
  Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph Housing Corp. v. Regional Assessment Commissioner, 
  Region 1 (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 532 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [23] The Foundation submits that the Work Centre receives a considerable portion 
  of its funds from various government sources and that because it then pays rent 
  to the Foundation, it can be said that the Foundation receives, indirectly, 
  these government funds.</p>
<p>
  [24] I disagree. In my view, the application judge's reasoning on this issue 
  is sound. The natural and ordinary meaning of the words "supported&#133;by 
  public funds" is that the charitable institution must receive the funds 
  directly from a government source.</p>
<p>
  Direct funding</p>
<p>
  [25] The application judge, in exceptionally comprehensive reasons, said nothing 
  about this issue. She recorded submissions from both counsel on the indirect 
  funding issue, and rendered a decision on that issue.</p>
<p>
  [26] Before the Divisional Court, the Foundation contended that the application 
  judge failed to deal with uncontradicted evidence that it received funding directly 
  from Human Resources Development Canada ("HRDC"). The Divisional Court 
  rejected this submission: "We are satisfied that the evidence before Polowin 
  J. was not clear that there was any direct funding. Polowin J. was entitled 
  to conclude therefore that the appellant had not established it was supported 
  in part by public funds."</p>
<p>
  [27] The Foundation concedes that the test on this issue is whether the Divisional 
  Court erred by not concluding that the application judge made a palpable and 
  overriding error by failing to hold that the Foundation received funds directly 
  from a government source: see Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235.</p>
<p>
  [28] The initial application record contained nothing about direct government 
  funding to the Foundation. In the affidavit of Donald Palmer, a director of 
  the Foundation and the Executive Director of the Work Centre, sworn on March 
  16, 2001, there is no reference to the Foundation's revenues. The only reference 
  is to the Work Centre's funding: </p>
<p class="indent">
  14. The Causeway Work Centre receives funding from Human Resources and Development 
  Canada, from the provincial Ministries of Health and Community and Social Services 
  and from the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton, now the City of Ottawa.</p>
<p>
  [29] Mr. Palmer signed a supplementary affidavit on June 7, 2001. Again, he 
  said nothing about the Foundation's revenues. The only reference to funding 
  was his statement, in paragraph 6, that the deficits arising from the operation 
  of the Work Centre's kitchen "are covered by subsidies from the provincial 
  and municipal governments."</p>
<p>
  [30] On August 9, 2001, Mr. Palmer was cross-examined on his two affidavits. 
  In the 57 page transcript of the cross-examination, there are only two general 
  questions about the Foundation's sources of revenue.</p>
<p>
  [31] On the cross-examination, the Foundation filed as exhibits the financial 
  statements of the Foundation from 1999 to 2001 and the financial statements 
  of the Work Centre from 1998 to 2000. These statements show that in all of these 
  years the Foundation received no government funding whereas the Work Centre 
  received almost all of its revenue from government sources.</p>
<p>
  [32] In light of these features of Mr. Palmer's affidavits, the cross-examination 
  on the affidavits, and the financial statements of the Foundation and the Work 
  Centre, it is not surprising that the application judge did not record any submissions 
  by counsel about direct government funding to the Foundation or consider this 
  issue in her reasons.</p>
<p>
  [33] Before the Divisional Court, and in this appeal, the Foundation sets against 
  this record a single response by Mr. Palmer during his cross-examination. The 
  response was to Question 145 of the 147 questions asked: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Q. Now, you referred earlier to another website that recently 
  was up and running. That's the Foundation's website?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes. One of the things that we did, as you know from what 
  we submitted, the Foundation has never had any staff. It's run by the eight 
  voluntary Board members. I end up doing most of the work for the Foundation, 
  as I'm sure I will in this case, because I'm in the unfortunate position of 
  being Executive Director of the Work Centre.</p>
<p class="indent">However, we did get a grant from HRDC in June of this year to 
  hire a staff person for the Foundation to start to get them organized, because 
  they haven't been in that position lately. She's working at 22 O'Meara. That's 
  where her office is [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [34] The Foundation contends that this is the uncontradicted evidence that it 
  receives funding directly from the federal government and that the application 
  judge and the Divisional Court erred by not relying on it.</p>
<p>
  [35] I disagree. In my view, the "we" in "we did get a grant 
  from HRDC" is equivocal. Mr. Palmer was both a director of the Foundation 
  and the Executive Director of the Work Centre. His two affidavits deal with 
  both institutions, as does the cross-examination on those affidavits. Indeed, 
  a fair reading of the affidavits and the cross-examination leads to the conclusion 
  that Mr. Palmer provided considerable information about government funding for 
  the Work Centre, including funding from HRDC. In contrast, he made only a single 
  and glancing reference to government funding for the Foundation. Accordingly, 
  in my view, it is as likely that Mr. Palmer was referring to new government 
  funding received by the Work Centre as to new funds for the Foundation in his 
  answer set out above.</p>
<p>
  [36] In addition, I do not think that Mr. Palmer's single answer stands as "uncontradicted". 
  The record before the application judge, including Mr. Palmer's affidavits and 
  the financial statements of both institutions, contained significant material 
  to support a conclusion that the Foundation had not established that it received 
  direct funding from a government source.</p>
<p>
  [37] Finally, I note again that the application judge's reasons were exceptionally 
  comprehensive. She recorded in detail the submissions made by counsel and considered 
  all of them. The absence of any reference in her reasons to the direct funding 
  issue leaves me with a real doubt that this was a live issue before the application 
  judge.</p>
<p>
  [38] For these reasons, I do not agree with the Foundation's submission on this 
  issue. The application judge's decision is far removed from being a palpable 
  and overriding error, and the Divisional Court was correct to uphold her decision 
  on this issue.</p>
<p>
  [39] I make a final observation. Obviously, if the Foundation can establish 
  that it has received direct government funding in years subsequent to 2001, 
  it would be entitled to an exemption, all other factors being the same.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [40] I would dismiss the appeal with costs, on a partial indemnity basis, fixed 
  at $5000 inclusive of disbursements and GST, if demanded.</p>
