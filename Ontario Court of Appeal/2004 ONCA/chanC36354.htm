<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals against his conviction for robbery and requests leave 
  to appeal the sentence imposed of 22 months imprisonment. He submits that the 
  trial judge erred in ruling that a co-accused's videotaped K.G.B. statement 
  implicating him in the robbery was admissible for the truth of its content at 
  his trial. In addition, he submits that the trial judge erred in failing to 
  impose a conditional sentence.</p>
<p>
  [2] On July 9, 1999, the appellant, Mr. Chung and one other person were arrested 
  in connection with the robbery of a fast food outlet. At the time of his arrest, 
  Mr. Chung made a statement to the police implicating himself, the third person, 
  and the appellant in the robbery. Prior to the appellant's trial, Mr. Chung 
  pled guilty to armed robbery and forcible confinement. He was sentenced to two 
  years less a day imprisonment plus probation.</p>
<p>
  [3] When called as a witness at the appellant's trial, Mr. Chung claimed a lack 
  of memory about the appellant's involvement in the robbery and refused to refresh 
  his memory from his statement to the police. In determining that Mr. Chung's 
  K.G.B. statement met the test of threshold reliability, the trial judge applied 
  the standard of proof on a balance of probabilities. As part of the determination, 
  he concluded that Mr. Chung's statement was voluntary and that Mr. Chung's right 
  to counsel had not been infringed.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in applying the standard 
  of proof on a balance of probabilities to the issue of voluntariness. He relies 
  on Lamer J.'s statement in R. v. K.G.B. (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (S.C.C.) 
  at 299 that, in determining threshold reliability,</p>
<p class="indent"> The trial judge must satisfy him or herself (again, in the 
  majority of cases on the balance of probabilities) on the voir dire that the 
  statement was not the product of coercion... [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant contends that Lamer J.'s comments open the door to a category 
  of rare exceptions in relation to the prior statements of non-accused witnesses 
  to the general requirement of proof of threshold reliability on a balance of 
  probabilities. Moreover, he submits that policy reasons dictate that where the 
  Crown seeks to admit a co-accused's K.G.B. statement implicating an accused 
  for the truth of its content, the Crown must prove voluntariness on the standard 
  of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>
  [6] We do not accept the appellant's submissions. In K.G.B., Lamer J. refers 
  specifically to a category of cases involving the prior statements of non-accused 
  witnesses that repeat an admission made by the accused: see pp. 286 and 297. 
  In relation to that category of statements, he stipulates, that where the non-accused 
  witness "reports an admission of the accused made to a person in authority, 
  the higher burden associated with the law relating to confessions may well apply." 
  In our view, Lamer J.'s comments in K.G.B. concerning the necessity of proof 
  beyond a reasonable doubt do not extend beyond that specific sub-category i.e., 
  cases involving prior statements of non-accused witnesses that report an admission 
  made by the accused to a person in authority. </p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant was unable to refer us to any cases in which the interpretation 
  he advances of Lamer J.'s comments has been adopted. We conclude the trial judge 
  did not err in applying a standard of proof on a balance of probabilities.</p>
<p>
  [8] As a further ground of appeal, the appellant submits that the trial judge 
  erred in two respects in finding that Mr. Chung's K.G.B statement was voluntary: 
  (1) in failing to conclude that Mr. Chung's right to counsel was infringed and 
  that the infringement adversely affected the voluntariness of his statement 
  (in this regard, the appellant relies on the fact that Mr. Chung asserted his 
  right to counsel when he arrived at the police station but did not telephone 
  his lawyer before making the K.G.B statement); and (2) in concluding that Mr. 
  Chung's K.G.B statement was voluntary in the face of the failure of the police 
  to videotape two prior statements made by Mr. Chung in the two-to-three hour 
  period immediately preceding the K.G.B statement. </p>
<p>
  [9] We disagree. The impugned findings involve questions of mixed fact and law. 
  The trial judge made a specific finding that Mr. Chung was given an opportunity 
  on at least three occasions to call a lawyer. He did not do so. The trial judge's 
  finding was available on the evidence and we see no basis to interfere with 
  it. </p>
<p>
  [10] As for the failure of the police to videotape Mr. Chung's prior statements, 
  the trial judge made a specific finding that Mr. Chung was not a credible witness 
  and rejected his evidence that the police assaulted him and attempted to script 
  his evidence during the course of the earlier statements. In reaching his conclusion 
  that the K.G.B statement was voluntary, the trial judge had the opportunity 
  to see Mr. Chung in the witness box, and to read a transcript and observe a 
  videotape of the K.G.B statement. The trial judge noted that there were long 
  passages in the K.G.B statement detailing Mr. Chung's involvement in the robbery 
  and that Mr. Chung gave no indication of being disoriented. Mr. Chung spoke 
  clearly, his answers indicated that he was focused and he had a good recall 
  of the sequence of events on July 9, 1999. </p>
<p>
  [11] In our view, the trial judge's findings indicate that, in the particular 
  circumstances of this case, he was satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, 
  that there was a sufficient record of Mr. Chung's interactions with the police 
  to permit him to properly assess the question of voluntariness. We are not persuaded 
  that there is any basis for interfering with his conclusion that Mr. Chung's 
  K.G.B. statement was voluntary. Accordingly, we would dismiss the conviction 
  appeal.</p>
<p>
  [12] On the sentence appeal, the appellant contends that the trial judge erred 
  in principle because he based his conclusion that the appellant is a danger 
  to the community on the fact that a conditional sentence would undermine community 
  confidence in the justice system. </p>
<p>
  [13] We disagree. Read fairly and as a whole, the trial judge's reasons reflect 
  a finding that the appellant had not accepted responsibility for his involvement 
  in what was a very serious offence and that, in such circumstances, a conditional 
  sentence would not adequately address the sentencing principles of denunciation 
  and deterrence. </p>
<p>
  [14] For the reasons given, the conviction appeal is dismissed. Leave to appeal 
  sentence is granted but the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
