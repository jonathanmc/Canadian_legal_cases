<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The fundamental issue before the Summary Conviction Appeal Court was whether 
  the finding by the trial judge that what the appellant held in his hand was 
  a handgun was unreasonable. The trial judge made this finding after refusing, 
  without any explanation, the request to amend the information to encompass either 
  a handgun or an imitation handgun.</p>
<p>
  [2] The Summary Conviction Appeal Court erred in not squarely dealing with this 
  question. However, in our view, the correct answer to the question is that a 
  reasonable trier of fact could reach this conclusion on this record and, hence, 
  the trial judgment ought not be set aside. </p>
<p>
  [3] It is true that the complainant was equivocal on the question of whether 
  she could tell for certain whether the gun was real or fake. However, the trial 
  judge also had before him the evidence of the complainant's clear belief that 
  it was a gun, her description of the object, the appellant's conduct in relation 
  to it and his use of it together with the appellant's threat to shoot while 
  holding it. Moreover, there was a complete absence of evidence to the contrary. 
  Taken together, this is a sufficient foundation for the trial judge's finding 
  that it was a handgun.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant argues that the trial judge also erred in admitting evidence 
  of bad character. We agree with the Summary Conviction Appeal Court that this 
  evidence was properly admitted as part of the narrative and was not misused. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] Therefore, despite Mr. Horner's able argument, we would grant leave to appeal 
  but dismiss the appeal.</p>
