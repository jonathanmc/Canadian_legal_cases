<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Nancy L. Backhouse of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated November 29, 2002.</p>
<p>MOLDAVER J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] On November 12, 1999, Natalia Chenderovitch and members of her family commenced 
  an action against Budget Car Rentals Toronto Limited ("Budget") and 
  others for damages arising out of a motor vehicle accident. After delivering 
  its statement of defence, Budget moved by way of summary judgment to have the 
  action dismissed on the basis that it was statute-barred. On November 29, 2002, 
  Backhouse J. dismissed Budget's motion. Budget appeals from that order.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appeal is narrow in focus. It involves the limitation period specified 
  in s. 206(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H. 8, as amended, ("HTA") 
  and its application under the Bill 59 insurance regime when a person is injured 
  in a motor vehicle accident and suffers both pecuniary damages and non-pecuniary 
  damages. In particular, the issue to be determined is whether, under the Bill 
  59 regime, an action is statute-barred when it is commenced within two years 
  of the plaintiff discovering that he or she has sustained the type of injuries 
  required by statute to support an action for non-pecuniary damages but more 
  than two years from the time the plaintiff could have brought an action for 
  pecuniary damages.</p>
<p>
  [3] For reasons that follow, I am of the view that the plaintiff's action for 
  non-pecuniary damages was not statute-barred and the motions judge was correct 
  in dismissing Budget's application for summary judgment. Accordingly, I would 
  dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [4] The facts are straightforward. On April 29, 1997, Natalia Chenderovitch 
  was involved in a motor vehicle accident. The car that struck her vehicle was 
  owned by Budget. It was driven by someone whose whereabouts and identity are 
  unknown.</p>
<p> [5] As a result of injuries sustained in the collision, Natalia was unable 
  to return to work. On May 6, 1997, one week after the accident, Natalia became 
  entitled to and began to receive income replacement benefits from her insurer. 
  Those benefits, paid under the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule - Accidents 
  on or after November 1, 1996, O. Reg. 403/96, as amended, amounted to $185 per 
  week. That amount was less than Natalia had been earning at work. Accordingly, 
  under the Bill 59 regime (s. 267.5(1)) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  I. 8, as amended) she was entitled, as of May 6, 1997, to commence an action 
  against Budget for damages for loss of income. She did not do so, however, at 
  least not immediately. Instead, Natalia waited until November 12, 1999, to commence 
  her action. In it she claimed damages against Budget and others for loss of 
  income (pecuniary damages) and damages for loss of enjoyment of life and pain 
  and suffering (non-pecuniary damages).<a name="r1"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> 
</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p> [6] Budget concedes, for all purposes, including the appeal and any trial 
  that may follow, that Natalia's claim for non-pecuniary damages was issued within 
  the two-year limitation period specified in s. 206(1) of the HTA. Under ss. 
  267.5(5)(a) and (b) of the Insurance Act, such claims are foreclosed unless 
  the injured party can establish that as a result of the accident, he or she 
  has sustained permanent serious disfigurement or permanent serious impairment 
  of an important physical, mental or psychological function. Budget accepts for 
  all purposes that Natalia launched her claim for non-pecuniary damages within 
  two years of discovering that her injuries were of a kind required by s. 267.5(5). 
  <a name="r2"></a><a href="#2">[2]</a> </p>
<p>
  [7] Budget nonetheless maintains that Natalia's action is statute-barred because 
  it was not commenced within two years of May 6, 1997, the date on which she 
  knew that she had a pecuniary damage claim against Budget for loss of income. 
  That is the basis upon which Budget moved for summary judgment to have Natalia's 
  action dismissed. Before the motion was heard, Natalia abandoned her claim for 
  pecuniary damages. What impact that had on the matter, if any, remains to be 
  seen.</p>
<p>
  RULING OF THE MOTIONS JUDGE</p>
<p>
  [8] The motions judge rejected Budget's argument and refused to grant summary 
  judgment. In a brief endorsement, she reasoned as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Had this action claimed general damages only when it was commenced 
  it would have presumably been open to the plaintiff under Cahoon v. Franks, 
  [1967] S.C.R. 455 to add a claim for pecuniary loss after the expiration of 
  the limitation period. It would appear to be an anomalous result to be statute-barred 
  from bringing either a claim for pecuniary or non-pecuniary loss by having made 
  both claims within 2 years from the discoverability of the non-pecuniary but 
  not the pecuniary loss. Income loss may be very minor - would that then mean, 
  regardless of whether an income loss claim is made, the limitation period would 
  run from the date of the income loss and not from the discoverability of the 
  serious threshold injuries?</p>
<p class="indent">In my view there is no merit in this motion and it should be 
  dismissed.</p>
<p>
  RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS</p>
<p>
  [9] The relevant statutory provisions are: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I. 8, as amended: </p>
<p class="indent"> Bill 59</p>
<p class="indent">267.4 Sections 267.5 to 267.11 apply only to proceedings for 
  loss or damage from bodily injury or death arising from the use or operation, 
  after section 29 of the Automobile Insurance Rate Stability Act, 1996 comes 
  into force, of an automobile in Canada, the United States of America or a jurisdiction 
  designated in the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule.</p>
<p class="indent">267.5(1) Despite any other Act and subject to subsection (6), 
  the owner of any automobile, the occupants of an automobile and any person present 
  at the incident are not liable in an action in Ontario for the following damages 
  for income loss and loss of earning capacity from bodily injury or death arising 
  directly or indirectly from the use or operation of the automobile: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Damages for income loss suffered in the seven days after 
  the incident.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Damages for income loss suffered more than seven days after 
  the incident and before the trial of the action in excess of 80 per cent of 
  the net income loss as determined in accordance with the regulations, suffered 
  during that period.</p>
<p class="indent">3. Damages for loss of earning capacity suffered after the incident 
  and before the trial of the action in excess of 80 per cent of the net loss 
  of earning capacity, as determined in accordance with the regulations, suffered 
  during that period.</p>
<p class="indent">267.5(5) Despite any other Act and subject to subsection (6), 
  the owner of an automobile, the occupants of an automobile and any person present 
  at the incident are not liable in an action in Ontario for damages for non-pecuniary 
  loss, including damages for non-pecuniary loss under clause 61(2)(e) of the 
  Family Law Act, from bodily injury or death arising directly or indirectly from 
  the use or operation of the automobile, unless as a result of the use or operation 
  of the automobile the injured person has died or has sustained,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) permanent serious disfigurement; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) permanent serious impairment of an important physical, mental 
  or psychological function.</p>
<p class="indent">Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H. 8, as amended.</p>
<p class="indent">206(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), no proceeding shall 
  be brought against a person for the recovery of damages occasioned by a motor 
  vehicle after the expiration of two years from the time when the damages were 
  sustained.</p>
<p>
  BUDGET'S POSITION</p>
<p>
  [10] Budget's argument is straightforward. It hinges on the following two common 
  law propositions: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) there is only one cause of action for a single negligent 
  act and damages resulting from that act must be assessed in one proceeding (Cahoon 
  v. Franks, [1967] S.C.R. 455); and </p>
<p class="indent">(2) ignorance as to the type or extent of one's damages does 
  not delay time under a limitation period (Peixeiro v. Haberman, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 
  549).</p>
<p>
  [11] Applying those principles to the case at hand, Budget submits that Natalia 
  knew, as of May 6, 1997, that she had a cause of action against Budget for loss 
  of income. Hence, Budget maintains that for Natalia to comply with the two-year 
  limitation period specified in s. 206(1) of the HTA, she had to commence her 
  action by no later than May 6, 1999. Having failed to do so, her action is statute-barred.</p>
<p>
  [12] According to Budget, that result follows despite the fact that as of May 
  6, 1999, Natalia could not have claimed non-pecuniary damages because she had 
  not yet discovered that her injuries were sufficiently severe to satisfy the 
  statutory requirements of s. 267.5(5) of the Insurance Act. While perhaps unfortunate 
  for Natalia, as the court in Peixeiro observed, at common law, ignorance of 
  the type or extent of one's damages does not prevent the clock from ticking 
  on a limitation period. Absent a suggestion (and there was none here) that Natalia's 
  damages may have arisen from something other than a single act of negligence, 
  Natalia had but one cause of action against Budget. On Budget's analysis, that 
  cause of action arose on May 6, 1997, when, on the undisputed facts, she knew 
  or should have known that she could commence an action against Budget for loss 
  of income.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [13] In assessing the issue at hand, I think it is important to understand the 
  historical roots of Natalia's legal conundrum. That requires a brief review 
  of the several insurance regimes that have existed in this province since 1990.</p>
<p>
  [14] In Peixeiro, the Supreme Court examined the Bill 68 regime, commonly referred 
  to as the Ontario Motorist Protection Plan (OMPP). It came into force on June 
  22, 1990, with the proclamation of the Insurance Statute Law Amendment Act, 
  S.O. 1990, c. 2.</p>
<p>
  [15] Under that regime, accident victims could not commence an action against 
  the owner or occupants of an automobile or any person present at the scene of 
  an accident, either for pecuniary or non-pecuniary damages, unless the victim's 
  injuries met the "permanent and serious" requirements specified in 
  s. 266(1) of the Insurance Act. Consequently, as Major J. observed in Peixeiro 
  at pp. 561-62, no cause of action in tort existed until the "severity of 
  the injury" requirement was met, regardless of whether the victim was seeking 
  compensation for pecuniary or non-pecuniary damages: </p>
<p class="indent"> What insight can we gain into the meaning of s. 206(1) HTA, 
  given the exclusion of liability under s. 266 of the Insurance Act? An action 
  governed by s. 206(1) fails if it does not qualify under the exception provided 
  for in s. 266(1). The cause of action referred to in s. 206(3)[sic 206(1)] does 
  not accrue until the statutory requirement of s. 266(1) of the Insurance Act 
  is met. Under the no-fault system in place at the time of the accident, the 
  mere happening of an injury in a car accident does not found a cause of action. 
  No cause of action exists until sufficient severity of injury exists. This view 
  is strengthened by s. 266(3), which allows for a pre-trial motion on the issue 
  of the existence of a cause of action. Under s. 266(3), a motion may be brought 
  to determine whether there is a cause of action evident on the face of the record. 
  The onus is on the plaintiff to prove that his injuries meet the requirements 
  in s. 266(1)(b): Buffa v. Gauvin (1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 725 (Gen. Div.), and Meyer 
  v. Bright [(1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 129] at p. 146.</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, the right of action contemplated in s. 206(1) HTA 
  must refer to an action that is not excluded by s. 266 of the Insurance Act. 
  It cannot be otherwise [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [16] In 1994, Bill 164 came into force with the passing of the Insurance Statute 
  Law Amendment Act, S.O. 1993, c. 10. Under that regime, accident victims could 
  no longer sue for pecuniary damages regardless of the severity of their injuries. 
  Those whose injuries met the "permanent and serious" requirement could 
  only sue for non-pecuniary damages.</p>
<p>
  [17] In 1996, the Bill 164 regime was replaced with the Bill 59 regime. Among 
  other things, Bill 59 eliminated the restrictions, established in the two previous 
  regimes, on a victim's right to sue for pecuniary damages. In particular, s. 
  267.5(1) of the Insurance Act was added to the statutory scheme. It allowed 
  victims to seek compensation for pecuniary losses (not allowed under the Bill 
  164 regime) without requiring such victims to first meet a severity of injury 
  threshold (a requirement under the Bill 68 regime). </p>
<p>
  [18] It is instructive to understand the problem that Bill 59 sought to redress. 
  For that, I turn to the remarks of Mr. Flaherty, speaking for the government 
  of the day, on the second reading of Bill 59 (Ontario, Legislative Assembly, 
  Debates (June 17, 1996) at 3609): </p>
<p class="indent"> In the Liberal legislation in 1990, Bill 68, there was a verbal 
  threshold that was established that prohibited persons from claiming compensation 
  in tort, be it for pain and suffering or loss of income or any other compensation, 
  if they did not meet the "serious and permanent" requirements of that verbal 
  threshold law. The difficulty with that law in practice and in reality is that 
  it took away the right to full income compensation, so that if someone was unfortunately 
  injured through no fault of their own, or only partially through their fault, 
  in a motor vehicle accident and they suffered loss of income, to the extent 
  their loss of income exceeded the no-fault benefits paid and they did not cross 
  the threshold, that meant that they were not made whole, that they did not receive 
  their full loss of income, although this had happened to them, they were victims 
  and it wasn't their fault.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">It got worse in 1994. With Bill 164 the former government, the 
  New Democratic government, did something that had not been done in any modern 
  western society; that is, it took away totally from victims of motor vehicle 
  accidents in the province of Ontario the right to sue for economic loss &#133; 
  This Bill 164 system that came into force January 1, 1994, truly created a dramatic 
  inequity, taking away the right to sue for loss of income so that a victim could 
  not recover their loss of income in tort, regardless of threshold.</p>
<p class="indent">The new law, Bill 59, which has been introduced and which we 
  debate now at second reading, accomplishes the goal of balance between tort 
  compensation and no-fault compensation. To the extent to which an innocent victim 
  of a motor vehicle accident has a loss of income, that loss of income, to the 
  extent it exceeds the no-fault coverage, will be recoverable in tort without 
  the victim having to get over some sort of artificial threshold concerning the 
  nature of the injury. This is of fundamental importance in terms of fairness 
  to victims of motor vehicle accidents, and reasonable-minded persons looking 
  at this system who understand it realize that this is a fundamental equitable 
  reform that is necessary to put the system back in balance [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  [19] As is apparent, in enacting Bill 59, the legislature was concerned with 
  fairness to accident victims who had theretofore been unable to recover lost 
  income because they were precluded from doing so under Bill 164 or prevented 
  from doing so under Bill 68 due to the limited nature of their injuries. Now, 
  under s. 267.5(1), such victims could commence an action for loss of income 
  or loss of earning capacity without regard to the severity of their injuries, 
  the only caveat being that they could not claim for the first seven days of 
  loss. Non-pecuniary claims, on the other hand, remained tied to the severity 
  of the injuries. Under s. 267.5(5), such claims were foreclosed to victims whose 
  injuries did not reach the "permanent and serious" level of severity.</p>
<p>
  [20] The foregoing "historical overview" shows that Bill 59 was designed 
  to enhance the rights of accident victims, not detract from them. No counter-balancing 
  was intended. The purpose of the legislation was to enable accident victims 
  to recover pecuniary damages without regard to the severity of their injuries; 
  it was not to lay a limitation trap to prevent them from recovering legitimate 
  non-pecuniary damages. </p>
<p>
  [21] And yet, that is precisely what would occur if Budget's "single cause 
  of action" paradigm were to be accepted. Accident victims with a substantial 
  non-pecuniary damage claim for serious permanent injuries not discoverable within 
  two years of a discoverable pecuniary loss would be statute-barred if, by choice 
  or chance, they failed to pursue the pecuniary claim, regardless of its size 
  or consequence, within the limitation period. Likewise, victims with a substantial 
  non-pecuniary claim for permanent serious injuries not discoverable within two 
  years of a discoverable pecuniary loss might well be precluded from asserting 
  such a claim if, having brought the pecuniary loss claim within the applicable 
  limitation period, they either settled that claim or obtained judgment on it 
  before the non-pecuniary claim became discoverable (Cox v. Robert Simpson Co. 
  Ltd. (1974), 1 O.R. (2d) 333 (Ont. C.A.) at 334-35.</p>
<p>
  [22] Measured against the purpose of Bill 59, these examples cause me to turn 
  away from the "single cause of action" paradigm proposed by Budget. 
  In short, I am satisfied that in enacting Bill 59, the legislature did not intend 
  to lay a limitation trap to prevent accident victims, with pecuniary losses, 
  from pursuing significant non-pecuniary damage claims. </p>
<p>
  [23] In arriving at that conclusion, I have not ignored Budget's submission 
  that the legislature, mindful of the concern just outlined, acted in the belief 
  that most victims would know within two years of a discoverable pecuniary loss, 
  whether their injuries were sufficiently severe to sustain a non-pecuniary damage 
  claim. I reject that submission. To give effect to it would mean that the legislature 
  was prepared to sacrifice, for the sake of certainty or repose, the rights of 
  some of the most severely injured accident victims. I do not accept that. Instead, 
  I prefer to believe that in enacting s. 267.5, the legislature intended to draw 
  a distinction that the common law does not recognize. To be precise, it chose 
  to create separate causes of action for separate heads of damages arising out 
  of the same act of negligence. </p>
<p>
  [24] In so concluding, I note that Peixeiro had been decided before Bill 59 
  was enacted. Accordingly, the legislature can be taken to have known that the 
  discoverability principle applied to the two-year limitation period specified 
  in s. 206(1) of the HTA. That principle, designed to soften the rigours of limitation 
  periods in order to ensure fair treatment to injured plaintiffs, was explained 
  in Peixeiro at 563 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Since this Court's decisions in Kamloops (City of) v. Nielson, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 
  2, and Central Trust Co. v. Rafuse, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 147, at p. 224, discoverability 
  is a general rule applied to avoid the injustice of precluding an action before 
  the person is able to raise it [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [25] In enacting s. 267.5, I do not believe that the legislature intended to 
  create a regime that would result in the very kind of injustice identified in 
  Peixeiro - precluding an action before the person is able to raise it.</p>
<p>
  [26] The construction that I propose withstands scrutiny when tested against 
  the policy considerations applicable to statutes of limitations in general and 
  other relevant considerations that in my view apply to situations like the present 
  one.</p>
<p>
  [27] In M. (K.) v. M. (H.), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6, at paras. 21-24, the Supreme 
  Court identified the three traditional rationales for limitation periods. A 
  summary of each follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> CERTAINTY OR REPOSE: the right of a potential defendant to 
  be secure against stale claims and to be able to plan for the future without 
  the uncertainty inherent in potential liability.</p>
<p class="indent">EVIDENTIARY: the search for truth may be seriously impaired 
  by the loss of evidence, whether by death or disappearance of witnesses, failing 
  memories, loss of documents or otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">DILIGENCE: plaintiffs are expected to act diligently and not 
  "sleep on their rights"; statutes of limitation provide an incentive for plaintiffs 
  to bring suit in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>
  [28] In cases like the one at hand, those rationales pull in opposite directions 
  when applied to non-pecuniary damage claims. While the repose rationale supports 
  Budget's "single cause of action" paradigm, the evidentiary and diligence 
  rationales do not, at least not entirely. In terms of the evidentiary rationale, 
  key issues to be determined in a non-pecuniary damage claim will often include 
  the existence of "permanent serious" injuries, the cause of those 
  injuries, and the damages resulting from them. Evidence relating to those issues 
  tends to ripen, not disappear, as time passes. As for the diligence rationale, 
  under s. 267.5(5), non-pecuniary damage claims cannot be brought unless the 
  plaintiff is able to establish serious permanent injuries. Until such evidence 
  is discoverable, plaintiffs can hardly be faulted for "sleeping on their 
  rights".</p>
<p>
  [29] In Wilson v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 684 F.2d 111 (D.C. Cir. 1982), 
  the tension existing between the repose and evidentiary rationales figured prominently 
  in the court's decision to allow the plaintiff to continue an action for damages 
  resulting from a latent asbestos-related cancer. The problem facing the plaintiff 
  in that case arose from the fact that the cancer-related action was not commenced 
  until long after the three-year limitation period within which an action could 
  have been brought for damages resulting from a separate asbestos-related disease 
  known as asbestosis. </p>
<p>
  [30] Writing for the court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg J. (then Circuit Judge) first 
  exposed the tension that existed between the repose and evidentiary rationales. 
  She then moved to consider the interests of plaintiffs and defendants generally 
  in personal injury and death cases. At p. 119 of the decision, she stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> Looking beyond repose and evidentiary considerations, we take 
  into account the interests generally involved in personal injury and death cases: 
  plaintiff's in obtaining at least adequate compensation, defendant's in paying 
  no more than that. Integrating these two, the community seeks to advance, through 
  the system of adjudication, relief that will sufficiently, but not excessively, 
  compensate persons for injuries occasioned by the tortious acts of others. In 
  latent disease cases, this community interest would be significantly undermined 
  by a judge-made rule that upon manifestation of any harm, the injured party 
  must then, if ever, sue for all harms the same exposure may (or may not) occasion 
  some time in the future<a name="r3"></a><a href="#3">[3]</a> [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [31] In determining that the plaintiff's claim could continue, Ginsburg J. also 
  considered another factor which she identified as "concern for judicial 
  economy". On that subject, she observed at p. 120: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Concern for judicial economy also influences our decision. Upon diagnosis of 
  an initial illness, such as asbestosis, the injured party may not need or desire 
  judicial relief. Other sources, such as workers' compensation or private insurance, 
  may provide adequate recompense for the initial ailment. If no further disease 
  ensues, the injured party would have no cause to litigate. However, if such 
  a person is told that another, more serious disease may manifest itself later 
  on, and that a remedy in court will be barred unless an anticipatory action 
  is filed currently, there will be a powerful incentive to go to court, for the 
  consequence of a wait-and-see approach to the commencement of litigation may 
  be too severe to risk. Moreover, a plaintiff's representative in such a case 
  may be motivated to protract and delay once in court so that the full story 
  of his client's condition will be known before the case is set for trial [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [32] In the end, having considered the relevant factors, Ginsburg J. held at 
  p. 120 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  With respect to the statute of limitations issue before us, we conclude that 
  a potential defendant's interest in repose is counterbalanced and outweighed 
  by other factors, including evidentiary considerations, securing fair compensation 
  for serious harm, and deterring uneconomical anticipatory lawsuits. We therefore 
  hold that the diagnosis of "mild asbestosis" received by Henry Wilson 
  in February 1973 did not start the clock on his right to sue for the separate 
  and distinct disease, mesothelioma, attributable to the same asbestos exposure, 
  but not manifest until February 1978 [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [33] Manifestly, the situation in Johns-Manville differs from the situation 
  here. In Johns-Manville, Ginsburg J. was applying common law principles to a 
  common law defence. Our task does not require a reconsideration of common law 
  principles. On the contrary, we are concerned with the interpretation of a particular 
  statutory regime. Nonetheless, I find her reasoning helpful. It supports my 
  view that in enacting s. 267.5, the legislature saw fit to draw a distinction 
  that the common law does not recognize - the creation of two separate causes 
  of action for different heads of damages arising out of the same negligent act. 
  It did so to avoid the injustice of precluding an action before the person affected 
  is able to raise it.</p>
<p>
  [34] For these reasons, I am satisfied that Natalia can pursue her non-pecuniary 
  damage claim. Because she abandoned her pecuniary damage claim prior to the 
  summary judgment motion before Backhouse J., it is unnecessary to finally decide 
  whether that claim would have been statute-barred had she chosen to pursue it.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [35] Natalia's non-pecuniary damage claim and the derivative claims associated 
  with it can continue. Accordingly, I would dismiss Budget's appeal with costs 
  fixed on a partial indemnity basis at $5,000.</p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> In the same action, members of her family 
  claimed for loss of guidance, care, and companionship under the Family Law Act, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. F. 3, and for out-of-pocket expenses relating to Natalia&#146;s 
  medical care.</p>
<p><a name="2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a> In light of Budget&#146;s concession 
  that it will raise no limitation defence at trial in respect of the non-pecuniary 
  damage claim if the order of Backhouse J. stands, we are satisfied that the 
  order under appeal is a final order. Accordingly, the appeal is properly within 
  our jurisdiction. </p>
<p><a name="3"></a><a href="#r3">[3]</a> Unlike the situation in Johns-Manville, 
  where the plaintiff, at least in theory, could have claimed damages for future 
  consequences (the likelihood of contracting cancer) within a claim for damages 
  resulting from asbestosis, the plaintiff in the present case could not have 
  done so with respect to &#147;future non-pecuniary damages&#148;. Had Natalia 
  issued her pecuniary loss claim within the applicable two-year limitation period 
  and incorporated, in it, a claim for &#147;future non-pecuniary damages&#148;, 
  given Budget&#146;s concession that her injuries were not discoverable within 
  the two-year limitation period applicable to her pecuniary loss claim, Budget 
  would have moved to strike out the non-pecuniary aspect of her claim &#150; 
  and it would have succeeded. Natalia&#146;s cause of action for non-pecuniary 
  damages under s. 267.5(5) had not ripened. The severity of her injuries were 
  then not known and not discoverable. Hence, she could not have pleaded the facts 
  needed to support a non-pecuniary damage claim.</p>
