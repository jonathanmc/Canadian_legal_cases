<p><strong>ZOE CHILDS ET AL. v. DESMOND DESORMEAUX ET AL., May 19, 2004: Weiler 
  J.A.; (O'Connor A.C.J.O., Weiler and Sharpe JJ.A) 50 pp. C38836</strong></p>
<p class="center">Title of proceedings: ZOE CHILDS, ANDREW CHILDS, PAULINE CHILDS, 
  HEATHER LEE CHILDS and JENNIFER CHRISTINE CHILDS v. DESMOND DESORMEAUX, JULIE 
  ZIMMERMAN, THE DOMINION OF CANADA GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY, THE GENERAL ACCIDENT 
  ASSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA and DWIGHT COURRIER</p>
<p>In Childs et al. v. Desormeaux et al., the issue was whether homeowners owe 
  a duty of care to a user of the road who is injured by the driving of an impaired 
  guest after attending a Bring Your Own Booze Party (&quot;BYOB&quot;). A user 
  of the road, Zo&euml; Childs, was seriously injured when the car in which she 
  was riding was struck by another car driven by an impaired driver, Desmond Desormeaux. 
  Prior to the collision, Desormeaux attended a BYOB party at the home of social 
  hosts Julie Zimmerman and Dwight Courrier and became impaired. Childs sued Desormeaux, 
  as well as Zimmerman and Courrier, for negligence. The trial judge held Desormeaux 
  liable. No appeal was taken from that decision. </p>
<p>In relation to the social hosts, the trial judge held that Childs was asking 
  the court to impose liability for a new duty of care, rather than one falling 
  within one of the recognized categories of duties in tort law. Before imposing 
  liability for a new duty of care, the court must be satisfied: (1) that the 
  relationship of the parties is sufficiently close to give rise to a duty of 
  care and (2) that there are no policy considerations that negative or limit 
  the scope of the duty. The trial judge held that the first requirement was satisfied. 
  He held that the social hosts had a duty to monitor Desormeaux's drinking while 
  at the party because he had a history of being a heavy drinker and had arrived 
  at the party with two passengers who were intoxicated. The trial judge declined, 
  however, to impose a duty of care on the social hosts for policy reasons and 
  dismissed the action. Childs appealed and Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) 
  was granted standing as an intervenor.</p>
<p>Weiler J.A., writing for a unanimous court, agreed with the trial judge that 
  the action should be dismissed but for different reasons. The trial judge did 
  not err in concluding that social host liability involved a novel duty of care. 
  However, Weiler J.A. held that the social hosts did not owe a duty of care to 
  users of the road. This was based on several key facts. First, the party was 
  a BYOB party. Thus, the social hosts did not provide nor serve the alcohol consumed 
  by the driver. Second, there was no evidence that the social hosts knew how 
  much alcohol the driver drank while at the party. Third, and most importantly, 
  the trial judge did not find that the social hosts knew that the driver was 
  impaired when he drove away from the party. </p>
<p>Because the social hosts did not owe a duty of care to users of the road, the 
  Court of Appeal did not have to explicitly decide whether social host liability 
  should be negated for policy reasons in all cases and did not do so. The court 
  suggested in a different factual scenario, such as where the social host knew 
  an impaired guest was going to drive, social hosts would owe a duty of care 
  to users of the road and liability could be imposed if social hosts did nothing 
  to protect innocent third parties provided it was otherwise fair and just to 
  do so. </p>
