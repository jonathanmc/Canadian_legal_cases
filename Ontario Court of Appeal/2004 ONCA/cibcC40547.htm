<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal from the decision of Fragomeni J. who granted summary 
  judgment in favour of the bank in the amount of $32,796.01 inclusive of prejudgment 
  interest. The appellant's primary complaint, however, relates to the dismissal 
  of its cross-motion to dismiss the Bank's motion on the ground of the Bank's 
  failure to attend at cross-examinations on its amended affidavit of documents 
  and to prevent the Bank from relying on its amended affidavit of documents.</p>
<p>[2] This is a simplified rules proceeding and the Bank took the position that 
  it did not have to attend on cross-examinations on notice. Except for the issue 
  of costs and sanctions for non-compliance with the Rules, however, this issue 
  became irrelevant because by the time of the Bank's summary judgment motion, 
  the Bank had provided an affidavit of documents making full disclosure. On the 
  basis of that documentation, the defendant's counsel did not oppose the motion 
  for summary judgment, although he still maintained his argument that he should 
  be entitled to cross-examine and that the Bank should not be entitled to rely 
  upon the newly produced documents. Fragomeni J., in the exercise of his discretion, 
  rejected those arguments.</p>
<p>[3] Before us, counsel for the appellant conceded that the summary judgment 
  was properly granted on the basis of the documentation currently provided. There 
  is no basis for setting aside that judgment.</p>
<p>[4] It is apparent from counsel's submissions that the real concern here is 
  the $30,000 in costs that Ms. Block has incurred in defending the action because 
  of the Bank's failure to make timely documentary disclosure. We agree with the 
  observation of Fragomeni J. that "a litigant, especially in simplified 
  procedure actions, must provide full and complete production" and, we would 
  add, in a timely fashion in accordance with the Rules.</p>
<p>[5] The Bank was clearly dilatory and incomplete in its production obligations 
  up until the instant motion for summary judgment and Fragomeni J. was right 
  in observing that if timely disclosure had been made, the action would likely 
  have been resolved. However, Fragomeni J. took these issues into account in 
  two different ways: first, he limited the Bank's recovery of prejudgment interest 
  to the date of the demand rather than the date of judgment. Secondly, he did 
  not award the Bank any costs notwithstanding Ms. Block had been unsuccessful. 
  This was significant because in view of her allegations of misrepresentation 
  and perjury against the Bank, she may well have been exposed to a significant 
  award of costs on a substantial indemnity basis.</p>
<p>[6] For all these reasons therefore, the appeal is dismissed. The respondent 
  is entitled to its costs of the appeal, fixed at $2,500.00.</p>
