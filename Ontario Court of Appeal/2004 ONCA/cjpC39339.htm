<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice Donald J. Gordon of the Superior 
  Court of Justice on August 6, 2002 and the sentence imposed on November 14, 
  2002.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant was tried before Justice D. J. Gordon of the Superior Court 
  of Justice on two charges of indecent assault and two charges of sexual assault. 
  He was acquitted of one count of sexual assault but convicted of the three other 
  charges. He was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment to be followed by three 
  years of probation. The appellant appeals against his convictions and sentence.</p>
<p>
  [2] The three complainants were sisters. The complainants' family and the appellant's 
  family were close friends and lived near each other, first in Wales and then 
  in Ontario (except for 1980-1984 when the appellant's family lived in British 
  Columbia). The complainants testified that the appellant engaged in several 
  sexual activities (exposing himself, sexual touching with his hands, oral sex 
  and masturbating while engaging in sexual touching) with them from 1976 to 1986 
  when they were children.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant denied that he had ever sexually touched any of the complainants 
  or exposed himself to any of the female members of the complainants' family.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant contends that the trial judge's convictions on three counts 
  was unreasonable. The appellant points out that the trial judge acquitted him 
  of one count of sexual assault against one of the complainants. However, the 
  trial judge found him guilty of indecent assault in relation to the same complainant. 
  The appellant submits that this inconsistency is inexplicable and, accordingly, 
  the verdict is unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  [5] We disagree. The trial judge conducted a particularly careful review of 
  the evidence of all three complainants. He described the evidence of two of 
  the complainants as "clear and concise" and had no difficulty concluding 
  that the appellant was guilty of the offences relating to them (counts 3 and 
  4).</p>
<p>
  [6] With respect to the third complainant, the trial judge found that the appellant 
  had engaged in sexual activity with her on five separate occasions. He also 
  concluded that although there were probably other incidents involving that complainant, 
  he was not satisfied about these incidents to "the required level of proof 
  beyond a reasonable doubt". The difference in his treatment of the various 
  incidents does not render the verdict unreasonable. On the contrary, the difference 
  is the result of careful assessment of the evidence relating to each incident. 
  Four of the five incidents that grounded the conviction in relation to the third 
  complainant had anchoring events about which there was considerably more detail 
  than a number of the other events. Moreover, some of the events that the trial 
  judge did not use as a basis for the conviction had evidence from the defence 
  (in particular, the appellant's sons) that could have raised a reasonable doubt. 
  Finally, the acquittal on count 2 is also explicable on the basis that the alleged 
  time frame for this offence covered some (although not all) of a period when 
  the appellant's family lived in British Columbia.</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant's second main ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred 
  by admitting and relying on similar fact and other discreditable conduct evidence. 
  The evidence in question was testimony from the three complainants and their 
  mother that the appellant exposed himself regularly, and masturbated occasionally, 
  when other people were around, and that these activities took place in the complainants' 
  family home when the appellant visited there.</p>
<p>
  [8] This was a multi-count indictment. No motion to sever was brought by defence 
  counsel. In addition, no objection was taken by experienced defence counsel 
  to the admission of this evidence. In our view, the evidence clearly met the 
  test in R. v. Handy (2002), 1 C.R. (6th) 203 (S.C.C.) for the admission of similar 
  fact evidence. It established a pattern of conduct in which the appellant was 
  prepared to risk being discovered exposing himself to the female members of 
  the complainants' family, often when other adults or even members of his own 
  family might have seen him. This was germane given that defence counsel attacked 
  the credibility of all three complainants by repeatedly referring to the implausibility 
  of someone taking the risk of sexually assaulting them when people were nearby 
  or even in the same room. Moreover, the appellant introduced considerable evidence 
  of his good character. In light of these aspects of the appellant's defence, 
  the evidence was properly admissible and the absence of an objection to the 
  testimony of the complainants and their mother about acts of exposure and masturbation 
  is not surprising. The trial judge found that there was no collusion. That finding 
  was open to him on the evidence. In our view, the probative value of the challenged 
  evidence was high and it outweighed any prejudicial effect.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant contends that a custodial sentence was inappropriate. The 
  offences took place between 16 and 26 years before the trial and the appellant 
  was a 62-year-old man with no criminal record.</p>
<p>
  [10] We disagree. The trial judge carefully considered the option of a conditional 
  sentence. He reasoned: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The seriousness of the crimes, the circumstances involving the breach of trust 
  by a family friend, the pattern of his conduct and the psychological damage 
  inflicted on one of the three victims demand a period of incarceration.</p>
<p>
  We agree with this assessment.</p>
<p>
  [11] The conviction appeal is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence is granted 
  and the appeal against sentence is dismissed.</p>
