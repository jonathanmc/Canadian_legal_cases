<p>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Justices Dennis G. Lane, 
  Edward F. Then and Joan L. Lax) dated July 8, 2002 quashing the order of the 
  Board of Inquiry (Human Rights Code) dated June 13, 2001.</p>
<p>
  O'CONNOR A.C.J.O.: </p>
<p>[1] The issue in this appeal is whether eligibility criteria attached to a 
  federal government housing grant are subject to provincial human rights legislation.</p>
<p>
  [2] In May, 1995, the appellant, Eleanor Iness, made a complaint to the Ontario 
  Human Rights Commission (the "Commission") alleging that one of the 
  criteria under which she received a housing subsidy discriminated against her 
  as a person in receipt of social assistance.</p>
<p>
  [3] In March, 2000, the Commission referred the matter to a Board of Inquiry 
  (the "Board"). By interim order dated June 13, 2001, the Board added 
  Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation ("CMHC"), the federal agency 
  which provided the housing subsidy, as a respondent in the proceedings. On July 
  8, 2002, the Divisional Court quashed that order.</p>
<p>
  [4] Ms. Iness appeals with leave. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss 
  the appeal.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [5] CMHC is a federal Crown corporation that is constituted as an agent of Her 
  Majesty in Right of Canada pursuant to s. 5(1) of the Canadian Mortgage and 
  Housing Corporation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-7; s. 4 of the National Housing Act, 
  R.S.C. 1985, c. N-11; and Part I of Schedule III and Part X of the Financial 
  Administration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-11.</p>
<p>
  [6] The purposes of the National Housing Act, which are set out in s. 3, include: 
  "to promote housing affordability and choice" and "to protect 
  the availability of adequate funding for housing at low cost".</p>
<p>
  [7] In furtherance of those purposes, Parliament authorized CMHC to make loans 
  and contributions and to attach terms and conditions thereto. The relevant provisions 
  of the National Housing Act are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 95(1) [CMHC] may make loans and contributions to assist with 
  the payment of the capital and operating costs of housing projects, and may 
  forgive amounts owing on those loans.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) [CMHC] may determine the terms and conditions on which it 
  makes a loan or contribution or forgives an amount under subsection (1), including, 
  without limiting the generality of the foregoing, </p>
<p class="indent10">a) conditions with respect to the operation or occupancy of 
  a housing project. </p>
<p> [8] In the exercise of the authority conferred upon it under the National 
  Housing Act, CMHC enters into operating agreements with housing co-operatives 
  to which it provides funding.</p>
<p>
  [9] On January 7, 1980, CMHC entered into an operating agreement (the "Operating 
  Agreement") with Caroline Co-Operative Homes Inc. (the "Co-op"), 
  a non-profit housing co-operative established under the Co-operative Corporations 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-35. The Operating Agreement sets out the maximum amount 
  of federal funding that the Co-op is eligible to receive and the terms and conditions 
  pursuant to which CMHC is willing to provide federal funding.</p>
<p>
  [10] From 1981 onwards, Ms. Iness was a member and resident of the Co-op. She 
  is a single mother and, at all material times, was in receipt of social assistance.</p>
<p>
  [11] In 1995, Ms. Iness filed a complaint against the Co-op with the Commission 
  alleging that the Co-op was discriminating against her on the prohibited ground 
  that she was receiving provincial social assistance. Ms. Iness alleged that 
  when determining the amount of rental charges, the Co-op differentiated between 
  members who received social assistance and those who did not.</p>
<p>
  [12] The Co-op established the rental changes in accordance with the provisions 
  of the Operating Agreement. For occupants of subsidized units not receiving 
  social assistance, rents were fixed at 25 per cent of their income. For occupants 
  receiving social assistance, rents were established pursuant to s. 2(9) of the 
  Operating Agreement, which reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Occupants receiving welfare assistance or family benefits shall pay the shelter 
  component of the welfare or family benefit payment or the amount required by 
  the application of the total payment to the rent-to-income scale identified 
  in Schedule A, whichever is the greater [emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [13] Prior to 1995, the Co-op calculated Ms. Iness' rent on the same rent-to-income 
  scale as it applied to occupants not receiving social assistance. Since the 
  shelter component of Ms. Iness' social assistance slightly exceeded 25 per cent 
  of her total benefits, she had a small portion of the shelter component available 
  to pay for utilities and insurance.</p>
<p>
  [14] In December 1999, the Commission released the results of its investigation 
  and recommended that a Board of Inquiry not be established. Ms. Iness and the 
  Co-op requested a reconsideration and, subsequently, the Commission referred 
  the complaint to the Board of Inquiry. Before the Board, Ms. Iness sought an 
  order directing the Co-op to set the rents of members receiving social assistance 
  according to the rent-geared-to-income formula that it applied to other members. 
  Although Ms. Iness did not include CMHC in her initial complaint, in October 
  2000, she and the Co-op brought a motion to have CMHC added as a party to the 
  proceedings before the Board.</p>
<p>
  [15] In the statement of facts and issues filed by the Commission with the Board, 
  the Commission alleged that in 1994, CMHC directed the Co-op to charge all social 
  assistance recipients the full amount of the allowable shelter component as 
  rent. As a result, Ms. Iness was required to pay her utility and insurance costs 
  of approximately $27.50 per month from the basic living component of her social 
  assistance, which is generally used for needs such as food and clothing. This, 
  Ms. Iness, alleges, is discrimination based on the prohibited ground of "receipt 
  of social assistance", pursuant to s. 2(1) of the Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. H.19 (the "Code").</p>
<p>
  [16] Ms. Iness and the Co-op argued that s. 2(9) of the Operating Agreement 
  was discriminatory because it was that provision that led the Co-op to calculate 
  Ms. Iness' rent in an amount equal to the full shelter component of her social 
  assistance. CMHC opposed the motion on the basis that the Board did not have 
  jurisdiction over CMHC or over the Operating Agreement. The Commission joined 
  CMHC in opposing the motion.</p>
<p>
  THE BOARD'S DECISION</p>
<p>
  [17] On June 13, 2001, the Board rendered an interim decision adding CMHC as 
  a respondent. The Board held that CMHC's funding policy and the Operating Agreement 
  are subject to provincial regulatory authority under the Code. The Board concluded 
  that s. 95 of the National Housing Act was enacted pursuant to the "federal 
  spending power" which is not an enumerated head of power under the Constitution 
  Act, 1867. Citing Reference re Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 
  525, the Board acknowledged that "there are no constitutional restraints 
  on the federal spending power." However, the Board concluded that because 
  the power was engaged in a matter that is otherwise provincial, i.e. housing, 
  the matter was not brought into the legislative authority of Parliament. </p>
<p>
  [18] The Board also held that it had jurisdiction over CMHC to order the remedy 
  sought by Ms. Iness and the Co-op. The effect of the remedy would be to negate 
  s. 2(9) of the Operating Agreement by requiring that the Co-op set rents for 
  those receiving social assistance on the same rent geared-to-income formula 
  used for other members.</p>
<p>
  THE DIVISIONAL COURT'S DECISION</p>
<p>
  [19] CMHC applied to the Divisional Court seeking to quash the Board's decision 
  to add it as a party to the proceedings. The Commission supported CMHC's application. 
  Ms. Iness and the Board (now renamed the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario) opposed 
  it. The Co-op did not appear. </p>
<p>
  [20] The Divisional Court concluded that CMHC's authority to advance funds to 
  the Co-op is an exercise of Parliament's authority to legislate in relation 
  to public debt and property under s. 91(1A) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Further, 
  the court held that CMHC may attach conditions to the provision of funds and 
  that in so doing, CMHC does not take control of the subjects of human rights, 
  housing, or rents within the province. Rather it "is exercising the federal 
  power of stating the terms upon which federal money is available."</p>
<p>
  [21] The court went on to hold that by virtue of the doctrine of interjurisdictional 
  immunity, the Code should be read down so as not to limit the authority given 
  to CMHC by valid federal legislation, since the terms on which CMHC disburses 
  federal funds are part of its core function. As such, the court determined that 
  the impugned condition in s. 2(9) of the Operating Agreement is not subject 
  to the Code.</p>
<p>
  [22] Accordingly, the Divisional Court held there was no basis on which CMHC 
  could be made a respondent to the complaint pending before the Board and quashed 
  the Board's interim order.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [23] At the outset, it is important to keep in mind what is not in issue in 
  this appeal. The appellant does not argue that the National Housing Act, which 
  authorizes CMHC to make housing grants or loans, is invalid. The appellant accepts 
  that Parliament has the power to dispose of its own property, to spend the money 
  which its taxes yield and to impose conditions on the disposition of such funds. 
  The appellant also does not argue that CMHC acted beyond its authorized powers 
  when it inserted s. 2(9) into the Operating Agreement. </p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant argues, however, that s. 2(9) falls within the province's 
  jurisdiction over housing or human rights in the context of housing and that, 
  as a result, the Code applies to CMHC and to s. 2(9). That argument can best 
  be addressed by answering two questions: </p>
<p class="indent">a) How should s. 2(9) be characterized - as an exercise of an 
  exclusive federal power flowing from the Constitution Act, 1867 or as an action 
  of the federal government in an area within the jurisdiction of the province?; 
  and </p>
<p class="indent">b) Does the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity apply to 
  preclude the application of the Code to CMHC and to s. 2(9)?</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (a) The characterization of s. 2(9)</p>
<p> [25] Parliament has the power to spend money raised by taxes and to dispose 
  of its property. This power, often referred to as the "spending power", is not 
  expressly set out in the Constitution Act, 1867. However, it may be inferred 
  from s. 91(1A), which confers on Parliament the exclusive authority to legislate 
  in relation to "the Public Debt and Property". Under s. 91(1A), "property" has 
  been held to mean property in its broadest sense and includes monies raised 
  by taxes. YMHA Jewish Community Centre of Winnipeg Inc. v. Brown, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 
  1532 at 1548; Central Mortgage and Housing Corp. v. Co-operative College Residences, 
  Inc. et al. (1975), 13 O.R. (2d) 394 at 410 (C.A.); Greater Toronto Airports 
  Authority v. Mississauga (City) (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 641 at 661 (C.A.); Peter 
  W. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada, loose-leaf ed. (Scarborough: Carswell, 
  2001) at 6-15 to 6-16<a name="r1"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a>; Gerard V. La Forest, 
  The Allocation of Taxing Power Under the Canadian Constitution (Toronto: Canadian 
  Tax Foundation, 1967) at 36.</p>
<p>
  [26] In Central Mortgage and Housing Corp. v. Co-operative College Residences, 
  supra, this court held that Part VI A of the National Housing Act which authorized 
  grants for housing came within the power of Parliament under s. 91(1A) of the 
  Constitution Act, 1867.</p>
<p>
  [27] It is well-accepted that Parliament's exclusive power to spend its own 
  money is accompanied by the power to impose conditions or restrictions on the 
  disposition of its funds or, as the Divisional Court put it, to state the terms 
  upon which federal money is available. In Central Mortgage and Housing Corp. 
  v. Co-operative College Residences, this court said, at p. 410: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Parliament of Canada has power under s. 91(1A) to legislate in relation 
  to its own debt and property. It can spend money which it has raised through 
  a proper exercise of its taxing power. It can impose conditions on the disposition 
  of such funds while they are still in its hands. It has used this power to make 
  federal grants-in-aid, which are subject to compliance with conditions that 
  the Parliament of Canada has prescribed.</p>
<p>See also YMHA, supra, at 1548; Hogg, supra, at 6-17 to 6-18; La Forest, supra, 
  at 36-37, 41. </p>
<p>
  [28] What remains to be resolved then is whether there are limits on Parliament's 
  authority to spend its money and, if so, where those limits should be set. That 
  is to say, at what point does the exercise of the federal spending power become 
  an impermissible intrusion into matters that fall within the exclusive jurisdiction 
  of the provinces?</p>
<p>
  [29] Viewed in its narrowest form, the federal spending power would be limited 
  solely to matters that are expressly within the federal legislative competence 
  under the Constitution Act, 1867. In other words, Parliament's spending power 
  would be equated with its legislative power. However, few argue for such a restrictive 
  approach, primarily because it fails to recognize the distinction between the 
  authority to legislate compulsory regulation on the one hand and the spending 
  or lending of money, with or without conditions, that may be voluntarily accepted 
  by the intended recipient on the other.</p>
<p>
  [30] It is generally accepted that the federal government is not constitutionally 
  limited to spending or lending money in those areas in which it has the express 
  power to legislate: YMHA, supra, at 1548; Re Canada Assistance Plan, [1991] 
  2 S.C.R. 525 at 565-567; CMHC v. Co-operative College Residences, supra, at 
  410; Winterhaven Stables Ltd. v. Canada (A.G.) (1988), 53 D.L.R. (4th) 413 at 
  433 (Alta. C.A.); Hogg, supra, at 6-17 to 6-19; La Forest, supra, at 47. </p>
<p>
  [31] The power to spend or lend federal money, however, is not unlimited. The 
  exercise of that power will be considered to impermissibly trench on the exclusive 
  jurisdiction of a province if the exercise of the power is in reality an attempt 
  to regulate a matter within the provincial jurisdiction: A.G. Canada v. A.G. 
  Ontario, [1937] A.C. 355 (P.C.) (Reference Re Unemployment Insurance); YMHA, 
  supra, at 411; La Forest, supra, at 38-39; Hogg, supra, at 6-18 to 6-19. </p>
<p>
  [32] Drawing a line between what is considered to be a permissible exercise 
  of the federal spending power and what, in substance, is an attempt to regulate 
  a matter within provincial jurisdiction will not always be easy. Mere impact 
  upon a constitutional interest of a province is not enough to constitute an 
  encroachment on provincial jurisdiction. More is required: Canada Assistance 
  Plan, supra, at 567. </p>
<p>
  [33] Interestingly, over the years, the federal government has frequently used 
  its spending power to influence social and economic policies in a broad range 
  of areas, such as education, heath care, housing, highways and social programs, 
  that come within the provincial competence with few, if any, challenges. Currently, 
  there are over one hundred federal/provincial shared-cost programs, mostly of 
  a continuing nature: Hogg, supra, at 6-11. </p>
<p>
  [34] In this case, I am satisfied that the impugned condition in s. 2(9) of 
  the Operating Agreement is a valid exercise of the federal government's exclusive 
  power to spend its own money. It was not, in substance, an attempt to regulate 
  in the provincial areas of housing or human rights relating to housing.</p>
<p>
  [35] The grant to the Co-op with the impugned condition was not mandatory. The 
  Co?op was free to accept or reject it. The voluntary nature of the grant argues 
  against the condition being construed as a regulation. Moreover, s. 2(9) is 
  manifestly linked to an exercise of Parliament's spending power. It is a provision 
  that limits the amount of the grant that is available to certain individuals. 
  The condition reflects a federal government policy that federal monies be used 
  to supplement, not replace, provincial social assistance for housing. The condition 
  is rationally connected to the federal government's exercise of its spending 
  power.</p>
<p>
  [36] As I pointed out above, the appellant accepts that CMHC had the authority 
  to make the grant to the Co-op and to attach the impugned condition. The appellant 
  argues, however, that in exercising the spending power in the area of housing, 
  the federal government acted as a private individual and, as such, is subject 
  to provincial laws.</p>
<p>
  [37] In support of this argument, the appellant points to the fact that the 
  Crown in Right of Canada is considered to be a legal person and, when acting 
  in that role, its executive has full power over its private property. Like any 
  private individual, the executive may engage in commercial activities. It can 
  sell, mortgage, lease, license or manage its property without the necessity 
  of legislation. The exercise of those commercial types of power need not coincide 
  with the federal government's legislative power because they are powers that 
  flow directly from the Crown's ownership and control of its own property.</p>
<p>
  [38] In this case, however, the power exercised by CMHC, in making the grant 
  to the Co-op, was authorized by legislation, the National Housing Act. As this 
  court held in CMHC v. Co-operative College Residences, supra, the National Housing 
  Act is a valid exercise of Parliament's authority to legislate in relation to 
  its debt and property pursuant to s. 91(1A) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Pursuant 
  to the National Housing Act, Parliament specifically conferred on CMHC the authority 
  to make grants for housing assistance, like the ones made to the Co-op, and 
  to attach conditions to those grants. CMHC exercised that authority. This is 
  a case of Parliament exercising its constitutional authority to spend its money. 
  It is not a case of the federal government acting merely as a private individual 
  in disposing of its property.</p>
<p>
  [39] In summary, I am satisfied that in making the grant to the Co-op and attaching 
  s. 2(9) of the Operating Agreement as a condition to the grant, the federal 
  government acted pursuant to its exclusive legislative authority flowing from 
  s. 91(1A) of the Constitution Act, 1867. </p>
<p>
  (b) Interjurisdictional Immunity</p>
<p>
  [40] The Divisional Court held that pursuant to the principle of interjurisdictional 
  immunity the Code should be read down so as not to apply to conditions imposed 
  by CMHC on the Co-op. The appellant submits that the Divisional Court erred 
  in applying the principle of interjurisdictional immunity to the exercise of 
  the federal spending power in an area of provincial jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  [41] The doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity protects the core content 
  of an exclusive federal power from provincial regulation. If a provincial law 
  affects a vital or essential aspect of the exercise of a federal power, then 
  the otherwise valid provincial law must be read down so as not to apply to the 
  exercise of the federal power: Bell Canada v. Qu&eacute;bec (Commission de la 
  sant&eacute; et de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; du travail du Qu&eacute;bec), [1988] 
  1 S.C.R. 749 at 816-817; Greater Toronto Airports Authority, supra, at 653-654; 
  Ordon Estate v. Grail, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 437 at 496-497; R. v. Lewis (1997), 155 
  D.L.R. (4th) 442 at 452-453 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [42] In Greater Toronto Airports Authority, supra, at 653, Laskin J.A. upheld 
  the decision of MacPherson J. and described the interjurisdictional immunity 
  doctrine as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The interjurisdictional immunity principle holds that "a basic minimum 
  and unassailable content" must be assigned to each head of federal legislative 
  power. Because federal legislative power is exclusive, provincial laws cannot 
  affect that essential core. A provincial law, valid in most of its applications, 
  must be read down not to apply to the core of the exclusive federal power. The 
  application of this principle differs from the paramountcy doctrine in that 
  it does not require conflicting or inconsistent federal legislation, or even 
  the existence of federal legislation.</p>
<p>
  [43] In my view, the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity applies as much 
  to Parliament's exclusive authority to spend its money as it does to any other 
  exercise of federal powers. Parliament's power to spend its money, like other 
  powers found in s. 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, is exclusive. Moreover, 
  if the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity did not apply to protect the 
  federal spending power, provincial legislation could, in effect, determine the 
  terms and conditions upon which federal funds are expended. That would be untenable. 
  In the same way that Parliament is not constitutionally permitted to use its 
  spending power to regulate matters of provincial jurisdiction, provincial legislatures 
  are not permitted to use their legislative authority to dictate the unassailable 
  core of the federal spending power. To do so would trench upon Parliament's 
  exclusive authority to spend federal money.</p>
<p>
  [44] Importantly, the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity does not operate 
  to protect all exercises of federal power. The doctrine requires that a provincial 
  law only be read down when it affects the unassailable core or, as it is sometimes 
  described, a vital or integral part of the exclusive federal power.</p>
<p>
  [45] In this case, I am satisfied that the impugned condition in s. 2(9) of 
  the Operating Agreement forms part of the unassailable core of the exercise 
  of the federal spending power. The purpose of s. 2(9) is to limit the amount 
  of federal funds advanced by way of grant by setting an eligibility criterion. 
  The section implements a policy that federal funds be used to add to, not replace, 
  provincial social assistance. The section is an essential component of the federal 
  government's exercise of its spending power in making grants to the Co-op.</p>
<p>
  [46] Finally, the appellant argues that the Ontario human rights legislation 
  is quasi-constitutional in nature and that, as such, it should be exempt from 
  the application of the interjurisdictional immunity doctrine. The appellant 
  does not cite any authority to support this submission and I fail to see the 
  basis for making that distinction in this case. It is worth noting that the 
  exercise of the federal spending power is not immune from scrutiny for the types 
  of concerns that underlie the Ontario Code. The Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 
  1985, c. H-6, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Bill of Rights, 
  R.S.C. 1985, App. III all apply to federal laws and undertakings. These regimes 
  have the advantage of subjecting the exercise of federal powers to uniform scrutiny 
  across the country, rather than to potentially differing provincial standards.</p>
<p>
  [47] In summary, I agree with the Divisional Court that, by virtue of the doctrine 
  of interjurisdictional immunity, the Code must be read down so as not to apply 
  to s. 2(9) of the Operating Agreement or CMHC in this case. </p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [48] I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [49] Having regard to the fact that all of the parties to this appeal are recipients, 
  directly or indirectly, of public funding, I would make no order as to costs 
  against any of them. </p>
