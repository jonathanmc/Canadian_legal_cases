<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] CNG Financial Corporation appeals from the decision of Pitt J. dismissing 
  its petition for a receiving order in the bankruptcy proceedings it initiated 
  against Canada Cash Advance Inc.</p>
<p>[2] CNG argues that as the bankruptcy judge found that Canada Cash committed 
  an act of bankruptcy, there was no proper basis upon which he could refuse to 
  issue a receiving order. In the alternative, CNG argues that the bankruptcy 
  judge failed to provide adequate reasons to explain his decision.</p>
<p>[3] CNG&#146;s petition was based on loans it had made to Canada Cash evidenced 
  by notes that had not been repaid when the notes came due. </p>
<p>[4] Section 43 (7) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 
  as amended, provides:</p>
<p class="indent">Where the court is not satisfied with the proof of the facts 
  alleged in the petition or of the service of the petition, or is satisfied by 
  the debtor that he is able to pay his debts, or that for other sufficient cause 
  no order ought to be made, it shall dismiss the petition.</p>
<p>[5] The bankruptcy judge was not satisfied with the proof of the facts alleged 
  in the petition and took the view there was other sufficient cause why no order 
  should be made.</p>
<p>[6] The bankruptcy judge described the debt as &#147;the sum allegedly due 
  and owing by Canada Cash to CNG&#148; and stated that he was unable to determine, 
  on the basis of the material before him, whether CNG made verbal promises to 
  Canada Cash that created legal rights. Canada Cash claims that it had an arrangement 
  with CNG that was akin to a partnership or joint venture, under which CNG agreed 
  to fund Canada Cash&#146;s future growth and expansion. CNG&#146;s position 
  is that it made no commitment to continue funding Canada Cash on any ongoing 
  basis.</p>
<p>[7] The bankruptcy judge noted there was evidence that Canada Cash had a close 
  relationship with CNG, CNG had provided Canada Cash over $1,200,000 in debt 
  and equity financing, and CNG had bought Canada Cash warrants for approximately 
  $450,000 that, if exercised, would have entitled CNG to acquire 60% of the common 
  stock of Canada Cash. Canada Cash had embarked on an expansion program, and 
  there was evidence that CNG first supported its expansion plans by way of capital, 
  then by way of loan, and later withdrew its support. There was the evidence 
  of Mr. Baxter that CNG made oral representations that it would not seek repayment 
  of the notes until Canada Cash became profitable at the end of its expansion 
  program, and that it would renew the notes, if necessary. This evidence supported 
  the bankruptcy judge&#146;s observation that to Canada Cash CNG was more than 
  just a creditor, and that CNG&#146;s conduct, verbal representations to Canada 
  Cash, and its failure to live up to those representations played a significant 
  part in creating the financial crisis faced by Canada Cash.</p>
<p>[8] While there was evidence to the contrary from CNG, the bankruptcy judge 
  was entitled to conclude he was not satisfied with the proof of the facts alleged 
  in the petition, and though Canada Cash could pursue a counterclaim through 
  a trustee in bankruptcy, given that CNG was the only petitioning creditor and 
  the only significant creditor, it was open to the bankruptcy judge to take the 
  view that the dispute between the parties was better decided by civil action 
  and to exercise his discretion accordingly under s. 43(7) of the Bankruptcy 
  and Insolvency Act.</p>
<p>[9] Furthermore, the fact that no articulated purpose would be served by a 
  bankruptcy and the fact that the application followed Canada Cash&#146;s protest 
  that CNG was responsible for its financial position provided an adequate basis 
  for the bankruptcy judge&#146;s inference that the petition was not brought 
  for the purpose of realizing Canada Cash&#146;s assets, but as a pre-emptive 
  strike.</p>
<p>[10] We conclude that bankruptcy judge was entitled to dismiss the petition 
  for a receiving order. </p>
<p>[11] Furthermore, we are satisfied that the bankruptcy judge&#146;s reasons 
  sufficiently explain the result to the parties and provide an adequate basis 
  for appellate review. The findings we have discussed above are expressly stated 
  in the reasons. Having made these findings to the parties, the bankruptcy judge 
  then dismissed the petition.</p>
<p>[12] The appeal is dismissed with costs on a partial indemnity basis to Canada 
  Cash fixed in the amount of $8000.00 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
