<p>On appeal from the order of Justice M. R. Dambrot of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated July 17, 2003.</p>
<p>R.A. BLAIR J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The court is called upon to resolve the interaction between two well-established 
  principles on this appeal. The first of these is the tenet of insurance subrogation 
  law that an insurer may sue only in the name of the insured in relation to a 
  subrogated claim. The second relates to the policy underlying the third party 
  provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure (rule 29.01), which seeks to promote 
  efficiency, cost effectiveness, and the avoidance of multiplicity of proceedings 
  in civil actions. The tension arises because the respondent, Zurich Insurance 
  Company, seeks to pursue, in its own name, what is in reality a subrograted 
  claim on behalf of the plaintiff, by way of a third party claim against the 
  appellants. The appeal also entails an examination of the nature of the subrogation 
  right in the context of a limitation period defence.</p>
<p>
  Introduction</p>
<p>
  [2] The defendants Tran and Vu (the "Tran defendants") were respectively 
  the operator and owner of a motor vehicle that struck another motor vehicle 
  being operated by the plaintiff, Ms. Freudmann-Cohen. She was injured in the 
  accident.</p>
<p>
  [3] Zurich is Ms. Freudmann-Cohen's insurer. It is a defendant in the action 
  because the Tran defendants are underinsured and the plaintiffs have asserted 
  a claim under their underinsured motorist coverage pursuant to Zurich's Family 
  Protection Endorsement O.E.F. 44. </p>
<p>
  [4] Zurich subsequently learned that Mr. Tran had been delivering pizza for 
  Pizza Nova franchise #81 at the time of the accident and that the franchisee 
  had insurance coverage. Zurich then issued a third party claim against Pizza 
  Nova Restaurants and Pizza Nova #81 (together "Pizza Nova") pursuant 
  to rule 29.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>
  [5] Pizza Nova moved for an order striking out the third party claim as failing 
  to disclose a reasonable cause of action, or, in the alternative, for summary 
  judgment dismissing the claim. Justice Dambrot dismissed the motion, and in 
  so doing concluded that Zurich could bring the third party claim in its own 
  name. Pizza Nova appeals from that decision.</p>
<p>
  [6] I would dismiss the appeal, for the reasons that follow.</p>
<p>
  Facts</p>
<p>
  [7] The accident occurred on October 15, 1993 and the action was commenced against 
  the Tran defendants on October 10, 1995. On June 18, 1996 Zurich was added as 
  a defendant, after the plaintiffs' solicitors formed the opinion that the Tran 
  defendants were underinsured. </p>
<p>
  [8] For reasons that are not explained, Mr. Tran was not examined for discovery 
  until April 30, 2001. At that time Zurich became aware that he had been delivering 
  pizza for Pizza Nova at the time of the accident. After further research, it 
  discovered in February 2002 that Pizza Nova had Non-Owned Automobile Insurance 
  Coverage. In May 2002, the plaintiffs consented to the issuance of Zurich's 
  third party claim, and on June 12, 2002, the third party claim was issued against 
  Pizza Nova.</p>
<p>
  [9] The Family Protection Endorsement - O.E.F. 44 is a prescribed form under 
  the Insurance Act R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, as amended, for insertion into policies 
  of automobile insurance where a premium is paid in consideration of which the 
  insurer agrees to indemnify the insured for the amount that he or she is entitled 
  to recover from an inadequately insured motorist. The insurer is then subrogated 
  to the claimant's rights in accordance with section 20 of O.E.F. 44, which states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where a claim is made under this endorsement, the insurer is subrogated to the 
  rights of the eligible claimant by whom a claim is made, and may maintain an 
  action in the name of that person against the inadequately insured motorist 
  and the persons referred to in section 7.</p>
<p>
  [10] As Dambrot J. noted, it is common ground that Pizza Nova falls within section 
  7.</p>
<p>
  [11] It appears to be common ground as well that the nature of the claim being 
  asserted by Zurich is a subrogation claim. Although the claim is framed in terms 
  of contribution and indemnity, contributory negligence and vicarious liability, 
  it is in substance the claim that the plaintiffs could have made against Pizza 
  Nova as Mr. Tran's employer, alleging that the appellants are jointly liable 
  with Mr. Tran for the plaintiffs' claims. No explanation has been provided for 
  why the plaintiffs have not themselves sought to add Pizza Nova as a party defendant, 
  but they have not done so.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [12] Pizza Nova's argument is two-fold. First, it submits that Zurich's only 
  claim against it is a subrogated claim. As such, the claim must therefore be 
  brought in the name of the insured (Freudmann-Cohen), by virtue both of the 
  language of O.E.F. 44 and at common law; it cannot be brought as an independent 
  third party claim in the name of the insurer, as Zurich has purported to do. 
  Secondly, Pizza Nova argues that a subrogated action is a derivative action 
  and Zurich accordingly has no greater right than the plaintiffs. Since the limitation 
  period for a claim by the plaintiffs against Pizza Nova has expired, Zurich's 
  claim is precluded as well. I shall refer to these arguments as "the third 
  party/subrogation argument" and "the limitation period argument".</p>
<p>
  The Third Party/Subrogation Argument</p>
<p>
  [13] An insurer's right to bring a subrogated claim to enforce the rights of 
  an insured, and to do so in the name of the insured, is now provided by s. 278(1) 
  of the Insurance Act R.S.O. 1990, c. I.</p>
<p>
  [14] The doctrine of subrogation is not confined to insurance law, but it has 
  a strong foothold in that domain. The fundamental principle of insurance is 
  indemnity, and subrogation law is closely aligned with that principle. A classic 
  statement of the indemnity principle is found in the following passage from 
  the judgment of Brett L.J. in Castellain v. Preston (1883), 11 Q.B. 380, at 
  386: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The very foundation, in my opinion, of every rule which has been applied to 
  insurance law is this, namely, that the contract of insurance contained in a 
  marine or fire policy is a contract of indemnity, and of indemnity only, and 
  that this contract means that the assured, in case of a loss against which the 
  policy has been made, shall be fully indemnified, but shall never be more than 
  fully indemnified. That is the fundamental principle of insurance . . .</p>
<p>
  [15] Later in that same judgment Brett L.J. made the connection between indemnity 
  and the doctrine of subrogation. He stated, at p. 387: </p>
<p class="indent">
  That doctrine (i.e., the doctrine of subrogation) does not arise upon any of 
  the terms of the contract of insurance: it is only another proposition which 
  has been adopted for the purpose of carrying out the fundamental rule which 
  I have mentioned, and it is a doctrine in favour of the underwriters or insurers 
  in order to prevent the assured from recovering more than a full indemnity; 
  it has been adopted solely for that reason.</p>
<p>
  [16] The appellants' argument is based upon the common law notion whereby an 
  insurer with a subrogated claim is said to be required to pursue that claim 
  in the name of the insured; it cannot sue in its own name: Gough v. Toronto 
  &amp; York Radial Railway (1918), 42 O.L.R. 415 (C.A.); Union Assurance Society 
  v. British Columbia Electric Railway (1915), 8 W.W.R. 327 (B.C.C.A.); Metz v. 
  Breland (1990), 47 C.C.L.I. 107 (Alta. C.A.). Section 278(1) of the Insurance 
  Act and O.E.F. 44 reflect this principle, providing, as they do, that the subrogated 
  insurer "may maintain an action in the name of the insured [or the eligible 
  claimant]". Accordingly, the appellants submit, the third party proceeding 
  cannot be brought in the insurer's name. </p>
<p>
  [17] An analysis of this position requires an examination of the third party 
  rule (rule 29.01) and its underpinnings, on the one hand, and the rationale 
  underlying the subrogation principle requiring the insurer to sue in the name 
  of the insured alone, on the other hand.</p>
<p>
  [18] The motions judge recognized the conflict between these two principles. 
  At para. 13 of his reasons he said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The position taken by E. Macdonald J. in Morey v. Knipple that the right of 
  the insurer to subrogate should not be defeated by the technical impediment 
  that it cannot, in the particular circumstances, bring the third party claim 
  in the name of the insured, but only in its own name, is a fair and just position. 
  It is consistent with the policy objective underlying the amendment to Rule 
  29 of having the rights of all the parties involved in the same factual situation 
  determined without a multiplicity of proceedings. It does appear, however, to 
  fly in the face of the words of OEF 44, and the common law, which both appear 
  to permit the insurer to maintain an action of this sort only in the name of 
  the insured. </p>
<p>
  [19] The motions judge had reservations about the reasoning in Morey v. Knipple, 
  [1994] O.J. No. 2181 (Gen. Div.), which followed an earlier decision, Carswell 
  v. Traders General Insurance Co. (1987), 19 C.P.C. (2d) 126 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), 
  affirmed (1987), 20 C.P.C. (2d) 117 (Div. Ct.). However, he felt obliged to 
  follow the prevailing view as laid down in those authorities, particularly since 
  the Divisional Court had approved the same approach in Nuvo Electronics Inc. 
  v. London Assurance, [2000] O.J. No. 808 (Div. Ct.). Although there is some 
  basis for the reservations of the motions judge, I am satisfied after considering 
  the provisions of rule 29.01, and the policy underlying it, in the context of 
  the nature of the subrogation rule in question, that his decision was correct.</p>
<p>
  [20] Rule 29.01 provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> A defendant may commence a third party claim against any person 
  who is not a party to the action and who,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) is or may be liable to the defendant for all or part of 
  the plaintiff's claim;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) is or may be liable to the defendant for an independent 
  claim for damages or other relief arising out of,</p>
<p class="indent">(i) a transaction or occurrence or series of transactions or 
  occurrences involved in the main action, or</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) a related transaction or occurrence or series of transactions 
  or occurrences; or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) should be bound by the determination of an issue arising 
  between the plaintiff and the defendant.</p>
<p> [21] This language is quite different from the provisions of the third party 
  rule, as it existed prior to 1985.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> Zurich 
  submits that the changes are pivotal to the disposition of this matter and that 
  they support Zurich's right to assert its third party claim. In effect, Zurich 
  argues that rule 29.01 constitutes a procedural scheme, with the force of regulation, 
  which overrides the normal subrogation principle requiring an insurer claiming 
  a subrogated right to sue in the name of the insured in circumstances such as 
  these. I agree.</p>
<p>
  [22] As several authorities have noted, the amendments effected by rule 29.01 
  were intended to make substantial changes in the law; claims which could not 
  previously have been asserted under the former Rule 167 may well be allowed 
  under rule 29.01: see Nuvo Electronics, Morey v. Knipple, and Carswell v. Traders 
  General Insurance Co., supra. In a notation to rule 29.01, the authors of Holmested 
  and Watson, Ontario Civil Procedure, 2003, -- Volume 1, state, at 604: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The significance of this change should not be underestimated. It changes the 
  very nature of a third party claim. No longer is it limited to situations designed 
  to obtain "a flow through of recovery" to D from the third party because 
  of the judgment that the plaintiff may obtain against the defendant. Instead, 
  it is now a general joinder device by which a defendant may engraft on to the 
  main action any "related claim" he or she may have against non-parties, 
  subject to the severance power given to the court by rule 29.09.</p>
<p>
  [23] The purpose of the new rule was to simplify third party procedure and to 
  avoid multiplicity of proceedings: Carswell v. Traders Insurance, at p. 129. 
  This promotes efficiency and expedition in litigation, lowers costs, and enhances 
  accessibility to the system. As E. Macdonald J. noted, in Morey at para. 26, 
  one of "the policies underlying the amendment to the rules, as reflected 
  in Rule 29 is the objective of having the rights of all parties involved in 
  the same factual situation determined without a multiplicity of proceedings". 
  See also Sanga v. Betteridge (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 773 at p. 777 (C.A.).</p>
<p> [24] It is significant, in my view, that under Rule 29.01(c) - the provision 
  relied on by Zurich in this case - it is not necessary for the person against 
  whom the third party claim is asserted to be a person who "is or may be liable 
  to the defendant". Rather, it is sufficient that the party sought to be added 
  "should be bound by the determination of an issue arising between the plaintiff 
  and the defendant". The fact that Zurich seeks to add Pizza Nova on the basis 
  of a claim by which Pizza Nova is or may be liable to the plaintiff is not fatal 
  to the operation of the third party procedure; in fact, it is exactly what that 
  procedure is now designed to do (assuming the other criteria for its operation 
  are also met).</p>
<p>
  [25] Pizza Nova argues that the requirement for an insurer, as subrogee, to 
  sue in the name of the insured is not merely a "technical impediment", 
  as the motions judge suggested, but rather a matter of substantive law. Therefore 
  it must be adhered to. I agree it is doubtful whether a procedural rule - desirable 
  as its objectives may be - can override a substantive common law principle. 
  But is the insurance law requirement that Zurich put forward its claim in the 
  name of the plaintiffs a matter of procedural or substantive law?</p>
<p>
  [26] There are cases that have allowed the third party procedural rule to supersede 
  the common law requirement; however, they had done so without analysis of the 
  rationale underlying the subrogation principle: see Morey, Carswell, and Nuvo 
  Electronics, supra. There are other authorities that have declined to do so: 
  see Harris v. Floyd (1991), 7 O.R. (3d) 512 (Master); Metz v. Breland (1990), 
  47 C.C.L.I. 107 (Alta. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [27] In my view, the provisions of rule 29.01 do permit a subrogated insurer 
  to issue a third party claim in circumstances such as this. I have reached this 
  conclusion because the subrogation principle obliging the insurer to sue in 
  the name of the insured - as well embedded in insurance law as it is - is nonetheless 
  a procedural requirement itself, as opposed to a substantive obligation. While 
  subrogation is a matter of substance rather than form (see Somersall v. Friedman, 
  2002 SCC 59, per Binnie J. at para. 97), this aspect of subrogation is a matter 
  of the procedure to be followed in the exercise of the substantive right of 
  subrogation.</p>
<p>
  [28] To understand this conclusion it is important to understand the rationale 
  underlying the principle that a subrogated insurer must sue in the name of the 
  insured. That rationale has its roots in the need to provide a process by which 
  the insurer would be able to exercise its subrogated rights. The principle of 
  "indemnity-but-no-more-than-indemnity" required that the insured take 
  - or, on being indemnified as to costs, permit to be taken - all steps within 
  the insured's power to reduce the amount of loss for which indemnity had been 
  received. This included exercising the insured's remedies against third parties. 
  Since those remedies were remedies personal to the insured, however, they could 
  only be exercised in the name of the insured as a matter of procedural law. 
  The common law did not provide a method whereby a person could be compelled 
  to commence an action against another; therefore, in the days before the Judicature 
  Act, insurers would have to apply to the Chancery Court and equity would compel 
  the insured to allow his or her name to be used for legal proceedings against 
  third persons in order to reduce the loss. See Yorkshire Insurance Co. Ltd. 
  v. Nisbet Shipping Co. Ltd., [1962] 2 Q.B. 330, per Diplock J. at 341.</p>
<p>
  [29] As Lord Cairns, the Lord Chancellor, noted in Simpson v. Thomson (1877), 
  3 App. Cas. 279 (H.L.), one of the early seminal cases on the subject, at p. 
  286: </p>
<p class="indent">
  My Lords, these authorities seem to me to be conclusive that the right of the 
  underwriters is merely to make such claim for damages as the insured himself 
  could have made, and it is for this reason that (according to the English mode 
  of procedure) they would have to make it in his name . . . [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [30] Similarly, in the same case Lord Penzance said, at p. 293: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In England, the action must be in the name of the shipowner, not of the underwriters. 
  I think this material, as shewing that it is the personal right of action of 
  the shipowner, the benefit of which is transferred to the underwriters. In other 
  systems of jurisprudence, or it may be in our own as altered hereafter, the 
  assignee of such a right may be able to sue in his own name.</p>
<p>
  [31] The requirement to sue in the name of the insurance claimant is therefore 
  procedural in origin, not substantive. A reference to assignment law is helpful 
  by way of analogy, too. Although subrogation is not the equivalent of assignment, 
  it has assignment-like aspects to it, as the comments of Lord Penzance indicate. 
  Whether an assignee can or cannot sue in his or her own name is another facet 
  of the law that is shrouded in mystery and history; but it is also based upon 
  the personal nature of the claim being asserted. It is clear that this same 
  type of requirement in assignment law is a procedural one. See rule 5.03(3); 
  DiGuilio v. Boland, [1958] O.R. 384 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [32] If the common law requirement that a subrogee must sue in the name of the 
  insured claimant is procedural in nature, the provisions of O.E.F. 44 that incorporate 
  it are procedural as well, as are the provisions of s. 278(1) of the Insurance 
  Act. I note in passing that neither of these provisions specify that the insurer 
  must sue in the name of the insured, but merely that it may do so. This suggests 
  they are designed to facilitate the insurer's subrogation right, not to circumscribe 
  it. I am satisfied, therefore, that what is at issue here is a competition between 
  two procedural principles - the one founded in the law of subrogation; the other 
  embodied in the provisions of rule 29.01 - rather than between a procedural 
  and a substantive right. In that competition the objectives expressed in the 
  rule, namely, more effective and less costly litigation, and the avoidance of 
  multiplicity of proceedings, should carry the day. </p>
<p> [33] The fact that Zurich has resorted to the third party procedure to put 
  its subrogated claim on behalf of the plaintiffs in play in the action does 
  not mean that Zurich is asserting the plaintiffs' claim against Pizza Nova in 
  Zurich's own name. As I have earlier pointed out, rule 29.01 merely provides 
  a mechanism whereby the defendant Zurich may ensure that an issue regarding 
  which the third party should be bound is determined in the action; it is not 
  necessary that that issue arise out of a claim whereby the defendant says the 
  third party is or may be liable to the defendant. In my view, Zurich is entitled 
  to resort to the third party rule in its own name in these circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [34] I am buttressed in my conclusion on this point - again by way of analogy 
  - by the decision of Krever J. in Chatam Motors Ltd. v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty 
  Insurance Co of New York (1983), 149 D.L.R. (3d) 94 (Div. Ct.). There, an insured 
  who was sued on a fidelity bond was entitled to institute third party proceedings 
  against the employee of the insured alleged to have committed the fraud causing 
  the loss, notwithstanding the defendant insurer was denying the claim and had 
  not paid the insured. This state of affairs appeared to fly in the face of another 
  deeply-entrenched principle of insurance subrogation law, namely, that the insurer 
  must admit the claim and indemnify the insured before it can recover on its 
  subrogated rights: see Brown, Insurance Law in Canada, 2001 - Rel. 2, s. 13.3(a) 
  and the cases therein referred to. This was said to preclude the insurer from 
  suing before payment of the claim, and therefore from instituting third party 
  proceedings before doing so. Krever J. rejected this argument in the procedural 
  context. At pp. 99-100 he said: </p>
<p class="indent"> . . . [it] must be emphasized that what is involved in this 
  appeal is not the right of the defendant to recover from the third party before 
  it has indemnified its insured, the plaintiff, but rather whether it is entitle 
  to resort to third party proceedings. . . .</p>
<p class="indent">That an insurer may not recover on a subrogated claim of the 
  insured against a third party is, I agree, substantive law. As a matter of principle, 
  it does not seem to me that it necessarily follows that, as a matter of procedure, 
  the insurer should therefore not be entitled to employ third party procedure 
  unless it has first indemnified the insured, at least in the circumstances of 
  this case. </p>
<p>
  [35] If as important a principle as the requirement that an insurer pay the 
  claim before suing to recover on its subrogated rights can yield to the desired 
  goal of promoting the disposition of all relevant issues between all relevant 
  parties in one action, thus avoiding the multiplicity of proceedings, I see 
  no reason in principle why the same result should not flow when the provisions 
  of rule 29.01 collide with the procedural principle in subrogation law requiring 
  the insurer to sue in the name of the insured.</p>
<p>
  [36] Mr. Strung concedes on behalf of the appellants that, leaving aside the 
  third party/subrogation issue and the limitation period defence, Pizza Nova 
  is a person who is not a party to the action but who "should be bound by 
  the determination of an issue arising between the plaintiff and the defendant" 
  pursuant to rule 29.01(c). The appellants fit into this category because of 
  the limits of Zurich's coverage under s. 4 of O.E.F. 44, which provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The insurer's maximum liability under this endorsement . . . is the amount by 
  which the limit of family protection coverage exceeds the total of all limits 
  of motor vehicle liability insurance . . . of the inadequately insured motorist 
  and of any person jointly liable with that motorist [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [37] Thus, the issues that must be sorted out between the plaintiffs and Zurich 
  in the main action include not only the amount, if any, by which the liability 
  of the Tran defendants exceeds the limits of their own insurance coverage, but 
  also the amount for which Pizza Nova (and therefore its insurer) may be liable. 
  The question of Zurich's liability cannot be settled until the latter issue 
  has been determined. Pizza Nova should be bound by that determination so that 
  it cannot take a different position at a later time.</p>
<p>
  [38] Finally, I pause here to consider a decision the appellants submit the 
  motions judge should have followed. In Maggio v. Lopes (1985), 51 O.R. (2d) 
  441, affirmed (1985), 52 O.R. (2d) 694 (Div. Ct.), Master Sandler refused to 
  authorize third party proceedings by a defendant (being defended by an insurer) 
  in a personal injury action against the plaintiff's no-fault insurer. The question 
  whether a subrogated insurer, as a defendant, could claim in its own name, as 
  opposed to the name of the insured, did not arise in that case, however. The 
  plaintiff had the right to elect whether to sue the tortfeasor or to claim no-fault 
  benefits. He chose the former route and there was no right in the tortfeasor's 
  insurer to claim the no-fault benefits from his own insurer or to sue for them. 
  There was therefore no issue in the action as between the plaintiff and the 
  defendant regarding which the plaintiff's no-fault insurer should be bound. 
  Accordingly, the third party claim was dismissed. The case is quite distinguishable 
  from the case at bar and does not assist the appellants.</p>
<p>
  [39] I would not give effect, therefore, to the appellants' arguments on the 
  third party/subrogation issue. A subrogated insurer is entitled to resort to 
  rule 29.01 in its own name for purposes of instituting third party proceedings, 
  provided the circumstances are such that the criteria set out in that Rule are 
  otherwise met. </p>
<p>
  The Limitation Period Argument</p>
<p>
  [40] The appellants' second argument is based upon the derivative nature of 
  the subrogated claim. An insurer can be in no better position against a third 
  party than the injured party would be: see Brown, Craig Insurance Law in Canada, 
  2001 - Rel. 2, s. 13.6; Royal Insurance v. Aguiar (1984) 48 O.R. (2d) 705 (C.A.); 
  Matt (Litigation guardian of) v. Barber, [2002] O.J. No. 3171 (C.A.). In the 
  context of the present case, it is the plaintiffs' claim against Pizza Nova 
  that Zurich seeks to have litigated. The appellants argue that that claim is 
  statute barred and since the insurer can be in no better position against a 
  third party than the insured, Zurich has nothing to which to be subrogated. 
  Accordingly, the third party claim should be struck.</p>
<p>
  [41] A subrogated claim is derivative, and I agree that it is the limitation 
  period as between the plaintiffs and Pizza Nova that is relevant for the purposes 
  of disposing of this submission. The argument must also fail, however, on discoverability 
  principles.</p>
<p>
  [42] The question whether Pizza Nova has a limitation period defence is a question 
  that cannot be determined on the record at this stage. As there is a triable 
  issue on the point, the motions judge was correct in declining to grant summary 
  judgment to the appellants on the basis that the limitation period has expired.</p>
<p>
  [43] Neither Royal Insurance Co. of Canada v. Aguiar nor Matt (Litigation Guardian 
  of) v. Barber, which are relied on by the appellants, are of assistance to them 
  in these circumstances. In Aguiar it was clear that the rights of the insured 
  persons were barred by the limitation period; therefore the subrogated claim 
  could not proceed. For the reasons outline above, that cannot be said to be 
  the case at this point in the proceedings here. Barber simply re-affirms the 
  principle that the right of subrogation is derivative in nature, a point that 
  is accepted, but not dispositive of the issues on this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [44] Given this conclusion, it is not necessary to determine whether the provisions 
  of s. 206(3) of the Highway Traffic Act S.O.1998, c. 38 or of s. 8 of the Negligence 
  Act R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1, apply to assist Zurich.</p>
<p>
  A Third Argument</p>
<p>
  [45] The appellants raised a third argument in support of the position that 
  Pizza Nova is not a party who should be bound by the determination of issues 
  between the plaintiffs and the defendant, under rule 29.01(c). It is based upon 
  the following logic. Since Pizza Nova cannot be found liable to either Zurich 
  (which cannot sue in its own name) or to the plaintiffs (against whom the limitation 
  period has run), there is no issue that the third parties should be bound by 
  and no reason for them to be a party to the action. </p>
<p>
  [46] This argument is simply a reiteration of the issues discussed above, however, 
  and cannot succeed for the reasons already outlined.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [47] For the foregoing reasons I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [48] In accordance with the agreement of counsel, costs are fixed at $3,000.00, 
  all inclusive, payable by the appellants to the respondent.</p>
<p>"R.A. Blair J.A."<br>
  "I agree E.E. Gillese J.A."<br>
  "I agree R.P. Armstrong J.A."</p>
