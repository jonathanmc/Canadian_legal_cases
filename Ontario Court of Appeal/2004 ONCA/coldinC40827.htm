<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] To support a conviction in this case it was necessary that the Crown establish, 
  and that the trial judge find, that the appellant made a threat to the complainant 
  to cause death or harm and that the complainant would be intimidated and in 
  fear as a result of the words spoken. The appellant admitted using the words 
  &quot;kill you&quot; in his utterance to the complainant, but claimed that his 
  full remark was an innocent one. He testified that what he actually said to 
  the complainant was &quot;You are acting like I'm trying to kill you.&quot; 
  The Crown essentially concedes that if those were the words uttered by the appellant, 
  the offence of uttering a threat within the meaning of s. 264.1(a) of the Criminal 
  Code would not be made out.</p>
<p>[2] The complainant testified that the words that she heard spoken by the appellant 
  were &quot;kill you&quot; and that she understood these words, in the full context 
  of her confrontation with the appellant, to be a threat. Her version of what 
  the appellant said, therefore, was not inconsistent, so far as it went, with 
  the appellant's version of what he had said. </p>
<p>[3] The trial judge made no finding of what words were actually spoken by the 
  appellant. This finding was crucial in the circumstances of this case. Moreover, 
  nowhere in his reasons does the trial judge expressly reject the appellant's 
  innocent explanation of what he said.</p>
<p>[4] On the basis of the trial judge's reasons, we are unclear as to what words 
  were considered by him to have been spoken by the appellant. Even assuming, 
  as the Crown invites us to do, that the trial judge rejected the appellant's 
  evidence as to what he said and accepted the complainant's account of the full 
  encounter, the trial judge's reasons do not indicate the basis for the rejection 
  of the appellant's evidence or the reason that he was disbelieved. These are 
  not matters upon which an accused in a criminal case should be required to guess.</p>
<p>[5] For the reasons given, we conclude that the actus reus of the offence was 
  not made out. The appeal is therefore allowed, the conviction for the offence 
  of threatening death is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>
