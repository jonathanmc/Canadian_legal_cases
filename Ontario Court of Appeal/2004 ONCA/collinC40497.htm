<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are all of the view that the application judge correctly concluded that 
  the evidence adduced by the Crown at the preliminary inquiry provided a basis 
  upon which the presiding judge could form the opinion that the evidence justified 
  a committal for trial. </p>
<p>
  [2] The limited power of review of an application to quash a committal for trial 
  was articulated by Martin J.A. in R. v. Tuske, [1978] O.J. No. 1253: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The reviewing court is not empowered to determine whether in its opinion there 
  is any evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting judicially could 
  convict, but is confined to considering whether there is any evidence before 
  the committing justice upon which acting judicially he could form an opinion 
  that the evidence is sufficient to put the accused on trial.</p>
<p>
  [3] We agree with the reviewing justice that there was "some evidence" 
  of identity before the preliminary hearing judge. There was evidence of motive, 
  opportunity, and several elements of post-offence conduct. In particular, there 
  were a number of statements made by the appellant, including two where he placed 
  himself at the murder scene. Further, there was evidence that the appellant 
  divested himself of several items of clothing similar to those described by 
  the eyewitness. Moreover, although there was potentially exculpatory evidence, 
  in all the circumstances, the eyewitness's evidence regarding the height and 
  weight of the perpetrator, and the fur trim and colour of the boots was not 
  sufficiently definitive to necessarily exclude the appellant. </p>
<p>
  [4] It follows that there was an evidentiary basis upon which, acting judicially, 
  the preliminary hearing judge could form the opinion that the evidence was sufficient 
  to commit for trial. </p>
<p>
  [5] The appeal is dismissed. </p>
<p> Signed: "K. Feldman J.A."<br>
