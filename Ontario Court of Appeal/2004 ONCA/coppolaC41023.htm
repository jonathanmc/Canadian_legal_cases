<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Coppola was tried before Montgomery J. of the Ontario Court of Justice 
  on charges contained in two informations. The first alleged four counts: assault, 
  uttering threats, unlawful confinement and failure to comply with probation. 
  The second alleged two counts of failing to comply with a recognizance and related 
  to a later date. Coppola was found not guilty of the counts in the second information 
  but guilty on all four counts of the first information.</p>
<p>[2] Coppola appealed both conviction and sentence to the Summary Conviction 
  Appeal Court. He sought and was granted bail pending the summary conviction 
  appeal. On November 24, 2003, Justice Shaughnessy dismissed the appeal. </p>
<p>[3] The appellant's principal submission is that the trial judge did not consider 
  the evidence of &quot;collusion&quot; relating to the breach of recognizance 
  charges on which he acquitted the appellant in considering the credibility of 
  the complainant in relation to the charges of assault and the other counts in 
  the first information. </p>
<p>[4] In our opinion the trial judge was alive to the concern raised by the appellant. 
  In his reasons the trial judge stated that he had to consider the totality of 
  the evidence presented to the court. In the course of giving his reasons on 
  the assault and related charges, he stated that he was satisfied that the complainant 
  did not come with an agenda to &quot;railroad the accused and be a stranger 
  to the truth&quot;. He found her evidence in relation to the assault charges 
  to be frank, reliable and he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the 
  appellant's guilt. There is no error of law and we cannot interfere. The appeal 
  as to conviction is dismissed.</p>
<p>[5] With respect to sentence the appellant acknowledges that the sentence was 
  within the range and there appears to be no error in principle. He has served 
  approximately three and a half months of his twelve month sentence. He will 
  be eligible for parole at the end of February. He seeks to have the sentence 
  varied to a conditional sentence from today's date. In support of that submission 
  he relies on the fact that he has been gainfully employed in what would appear 
  to be a good job while out on bail pending the summary conviction appeal. While 
  that is commendable, we note that he has never had a problem with employment 
  and that he has a history of violence and threatening violence towards women. 
  His good behaviour and employment success are commendable and, in our view, 
  these are matters that should properly be considered by the parole board. </p>
<p>[6] Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal as to 
  sentence is dismissed.</p>
