<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Harvey T. Spiegel of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated July 16, 2003. </p>
<p>
  WEILER J.A.: </p>
<p>
  Nature of Appeal </p>
<p>
  [1] The Neighbourhoods of Cornell Inc. ("Neighbourhoods") appeals 
  from the Order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Harvey T. Spiegel dated July 16, 
  2003, made at Toronto, Ontario granting summary judgment to 1440106 Ontario 
  Inc., Samuel Lam ("Lam") and Peter Wong ("Wong"), dismissing 
  Neighbourhoods' action for specific performance of an oral agreement for the 
  purchase of land. In dismissing the action, Spiegel J. concluded that there 
  was no genuine issue to be tried in connection with the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) there was no oral agreement between the parties for the 
  sale of the land, as at least two fundamental terms remained unresolved; </p>
<p class="indent">(b) there was no note or memorandum in writing to satisfy the 
  requirements of s. 4 of the Statute of Frauds; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) there was no part performance by Neighbourhoods that would 
  permit it to avoid the effect of the Statute of Frauds and to lead evidence 
  of an oral agreement for the purchase and sale of the land.</p>
<p>
  The Facts</p>
<p>
  The Parties</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent Lam is a retired radiologist and the respondent Peter Wong 
  is a clothing manufacturer. Lam and Wong were part of a group known as the Law 
  Development Group ("Law Group") who held title to nine large tracts 
  of land in the Cornell Community in the Town of Markham ("Cornel Lands"). 
  The appellant Neighbourhoods was incorporated in January 2002 for the purpose 
  of acquiring Area 5 and is part of the Tribute Group of companies, which engages 
  in the business of real estate development. Al Libfeld is the president of Tribute 
  and Andrew Gray is the Vice-President of Real Estate Development. </p>
<p>
  Overview of the negotiations</p>
<p>
  [3] Area 5 consists of approximately 345 acres and is part of the Cornell Lands. 
  In 1995, Law Group acquired the rights to the Cornell Lands from Ontario Realty 
  Corp. </p>
<p> ("ORC"). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the ORC, there was a 
  prohibition against resale until March 2002. The investors of Law Group subsequently 
  decided to divide the Cornell Lands among themselves, through a Partition Agreement 
  that would have to be negotiated and signed by all the of the investors. Lam 
  and Wong anticipated receiving Area 2/3 and Area 5 once a Cost Sharing Agreement 
  ("CSA") and the Partition Agreement was complete.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
  The CSA concerned the cost of putting in roads, sewers and municipal services 
  for the property. The amount in question could have been in the order of $20 
  million. </p>
<p>
  [4] Even though they were not in a position to sell until they finalized the 
  Partition Agreement, Lam and Wong began in July 2001 to investigate the possibilities 
  of a disposition of Area 5. They asked Babak Sarshar, a real estate broker and 
  consultant, to assist them and Sarshar approached Tribute. Libfeld on behalf 
  of Tribute initially entered into discussions with Lam, Wong and Sarshar regarding 
  a joint venture that did not result in agreement. Subsequently, they entered 
  into negotiations regarding an outright sale.</p>
<p>
  Neighbourhoods was incorporated by Tribute on January 23, 2002 for the purpose 
  of purchasing Area 5. Libfeld met on three occasions with Sarshar, Lam and Wong 
  regarding the proposed sale: January 23, 2002, February 15, 2002, and March 
  6, 2002. On February 17, 2002, Wong sent an email to Sarshar telling him the 
  basic terms that needed to be met, one of which was a purchase price of $40 
  million. On February 19, 2002, Sarshar forwarded Wong's e-mail to Libfeld. A 
  revised offer of $37 million was made on March 6, 2002. Wong and Lam advised 
  that they would sell the property for $39 million. Libfeld spoke to Sarshar 
  by telephone on March 8, 2002, and offered $39 million. Sarshar agrees that 
  Libfeld offered $39 million and that Sarshar congratulated Libfeld. Sarshar 
  says however that there were still outstanding terms to be negotiated. Two of 
  these outstanding terms involved the Developer Charge Credits and the CSA. Before 
  the motions judge there was no issue that the CSA was an essential term. The 
  CSA was still being negotiated by Law Group. The issue was whether Neighborhoods 
  agreed to assume its proportionate share of those costs from the vendors. </p>
<p>
  The motion judge's reasons in relation to the CSA</p>
<p>
  [5] In relation to the CSA, the motion judge held: </p>
<p class="indent">
  With respect to the obligations under the CSA, it is not disputed that Lam and 
  Wong made it clear that the purchaser would have to assume all these obligations. 
  Libfeld acknowledges that the obligations under the CSA were a significant issue, 
  and Libfeld says he expected the purchaser would assume all of the obligations 
  under the CSA. He says that this was not discussed at the March 6, 2002 meeting 
  or in his telephone conversation with Sashar on March 8, 2002 but it had been 
  agreed upon when the parties were discussing the joint venture in the summer 
  of 2001. In my view, this is far different from saying that he had agreed on 
  behalf of the plaintiff to assume these obligations in the agreement of purchase 
  and sale.</p>
<p>
  [6] On March 18, 2002, Neighbourhoods' solicitor, Arthur Shapero, emailed a 
  letter to Sarshar and attached an unsigned draft agreement of purchase and sale 
  ("Draft Agreement"). Section 1.2 of the Draft Agreement provided that 
  the agreement would be void unless executed by the parties on or before 5:00 
  p.m. on April 2, 2002. Neighbourhoods was also to pay a $200,000 deposit by 
  that date. Section 6.01(d) of the Draft Agreement gives the purchaser the unilateral 
  right to refuse to assume the obligations under the CSA, to refuse to close 
  the transaction, and to require the vendor to perform these obligations. None 
  of the parties signed the Draft Agreement nor was the deposit ever paid. </p>
<p>
  [7] On July 16, 2002, Libfeld spoke to Sarshar, the vendor's agent, and on July 
  18, 2002, Libfeld spoke to Lam. Libfeld tape-recorded both of those conversations. 
  Neighborhoods alleges that during the conversation on the 16th Sarshar acknowledged 
  that there was a deal for the purchase and sale of Area 5 and in the July 18, 
  2002 conversation, Lam confirmed that there was a deal but it was now dead and 
  that the Draft Agreement was not what the parties had agreed to.</p>
<p>
  [8] The trial judge commented in relation to the CSA clause: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is difficult to think of a clause that would be more inconsistent with Libfeld's 
  assertion that he agreed to assume all of the obligations under the CSA. In 
  my view, the provisions in the Draft Agreement are far more consistent with 
  Gray's evidence that the plaintiff was not prepared to agree to absorb the CSA 
  costs until the CSA was final and it was clear what those costs were going to 
  be. </p>
<p>
  Earlier in his reasons the trial judge had stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If Libfeld had agreed, it would have been a relatively simple thing to draft 
  a clause stating that the purchaser assumed all the obligations under the CSA 
  subject to being satisfied within the due diligence period that the CSA did 
  not contain any unduly onerous obligations. In the course of argument, counsel 
  for the plaintiff properly conceded that this type of clause would likely have 
  satisfied any concerns the vendors might have with respect to the obligations 
  under the CSA and still have protected the purchaser. </p>
<p>
  The trial judge continued: </p>
<p class="indent"> Libfield's assertion that the sections in the Draft Agreement 
  dealing with&#133;the CSA obligations were the result of drafting errors, is 
  in my view, a totally self-serving statement without any evidentiary support. 
  I note that this explanation was given for the first time on the cross-examination 
  of his affidavit in support of the motion to set aside the granting of the CPL. 
  (Certificate of Pending Litigation) Indeed, Libfeld had not read the Draft Agreement 
  until after the action had commenced and the CPL had been issued&#133;..</p>
<p class="indent">I am fully aware that it is not the role of a judge hearing 
  a motion for summary judgment to weigh the evidence or to assess credibility. 
  I also acknowledge that the burden is upon the moving party to establish that 
  there is no genuine issue for trial. However, the respondent must present, by 
  way of affidavit or other evidence specific facts, showing that the claim has 
  a real chance of success. In a defendant's motion for summary judgment the plaintiff 
  bears the evidentiary burden of demonstrating that its claim is adequately supported 
  by the evidence. See Guarantee Company of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp., 
  [1999] 3 S.C.R. 423 at 434-436.</p>
<p class="indent">Having taken a good hard look at the evidence, I have come to 
  the conclusion that the plaintiff has failed to satisfy its evidentiary burden 
  and that there is no genuine issue for trial on the question of whether there 
  was an oral agreement reached between the parties. </p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant submits that the motions judge put the test too high. The 
  appellant's position is, further, that the evidence of Libfeld was that Neighborhoods 
  would assume the CSA unless it was "off the wall" and that his evidence 
  in that regard raises a genuine issue for trial involving credibility. The motions 
  judge was not entitled to conclude that Libfeld's evidence was self-serving. 
  What the Draft Agreement said is of no consequence if there was an oral agreement 
  and what was put down on paper was wrong. </p>
<p>
  [10] In Guarantee Company of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp., [1999] 3 
  S.C.R. 423, the Supreme Court stated at pp. 434-435: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The appropriate test to be applied on a motion for summary judgment is satisfied 
  when the applicant has shown that there is no genuine issue of material fact 
  requiring a trial, and therefore summary judgment is a proper question for consideration 
  by the court... Once the moving party has made this showing, the respondent 
  must then 'establish his claim as being one with a real chance of success' [citations 
  omitted]. </p>
<p>
  [11] In that case Bailey, Gordon Capital's Compliance Officer, filed an affidavit 
  as to when Gordon Capital believed that a loss of the type covered by the Bond 
  had occurred. The affidavit was filed after a limitation period defence had 
  been asserted and reversed a position previously taken. Gordon Capital submitted 
  Bailey's affidavit raised a credibility issue sufficient to require a trial 
  as to when discovery of the loss under the Bond occurred. O'Brien J. disagreed 
  and granted summary judgment in favour of Guarantee Co. In the context of the 
  proceedings and taking into account the sophistication of the parties the Supreme 
  Court did not find his conclusion to be unreasonable and agreed with O'Brien 
  J.'s finding. The Court stated at p. 436: </p>
<p class="indent">
  We would add that the trial judge's ruling on this point is entirely consistent 
  with previous decisions holding that a self-serving affidavit is not sufficient 
  in itself to create a triable issue in the absence of detailed facts and supporting 
  evidence [citations omitted].</p>
<p>
  The Court, at p. 439, concluded that no issue for trial had been established: </p>
<p class="indent">
  We would therefore conclude that the motions judge committed no error in determining 
  that this was a proper case for summary judgment. Gordon has not met the evidentiary 
  burden to show there is a genuine issue for trial.</p>
<p>
  [12] In our opinion the motions judge did not misstate the law as set out in 
  Gordon Capital, supra. </p>
<p>
  [13] Nor did the trial judge err with respect to his finding that Libfeld's 
  affidavit was self-serving. The undisputed material fact is that the vendors, 
  Lam and Wong, required that the purchaser assume the CSA unless it contained 
  unduly onerous obligations. While Libfeld said that Neighborhoods had agreed 
  to assume those costs, that discussion took place in the context of a proposed 
  joint venture that did not proceed. It is undisputed that there was no specific 
  discussion about the CSA in the three meetings that took place between the parties 
  respecting the purchase of the property. Gray's evidence was that Neighborhoods 
  was not prepared to assume the CSA costs without knowing what those costs were. 
  The objective evidence, Neighborhoods' Draft Agreement, confirms this. Libfeld's 
  assertion that the sections in the Draft Agreement were the result of drafting 
  errors is not sufficient in itself to create a triable issue in the absence 
  of detailed facts and supporting evidence. Libfeld did not say he was prepared 
  to assume the CSA costs unless they were unduly onerous at the time of the events 
  in question i.e. in the subsequent telephone call that he had with Lam on July 
  18, 2002. Consequently, Lam's statement that the "deal is dead" cannot 
  be interpreted as an admission that there was an agreement on all essential 
  terms. Libfeld's statement is an after-the-fact reflection as in Gordon Capital, 
  supra. It is not a statement made at the time as in Gold Chance International 
  Ltd. v. Daigle &amp; Hancock (2001), 10 C.P.C. (5th) 368 (Ont. Sup. Ct.) upon 
  which the appellant relies. Nor is this a case where one party was not aware 
  of the other's position respecting a non-essential term that was not discussed 
  as in Fieguth v. Acklands Ltd. (1989), 59 D.L.R. (4th) 114 (B.C.C.A.). The motions 
  judge did not err in holding that Libfeld's affidavit was self-serving evidence. 
  Neighborhoods' claim that it had an oral agreement with Lam and Wong on all 
  essential matters has no real chance of success. </p>
<p>
  [14] There is no genuine issue for trial. </p>
<p>
  [15] In view of our conclusion it is not necessary to address the other issues 
  raised on this appeal. </p>
<p>
  [16] The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondents on a partial indemnity 
  basis fixed at $ 40, 000.</p>
