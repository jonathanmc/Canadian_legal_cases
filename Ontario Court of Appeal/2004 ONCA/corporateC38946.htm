<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from the decision of Brennan J. which dismissed its 
  application for a declaration that it is the owner of a 2000 Porsche motor vehicle 
  purchased from one Reynolds who had purportedly purchased the vehicle from the 
  respondent, Pfaff.</p>
<p>[2] It was fraudulently represented by Reynolds to the appellant that he had 
  purchased the Porsche vehicle from Pfaff and therefore had the authority to 
  sell the vehicle to the appellant.</p>
<p>[3] It is conceded by the respondent, Pfaff, that it effected the registration 
  of the vehicle with the Ministry of Transportation in the name of the appellant 
  at the request of Reynolds knowing that Reynolds had agreed to resell the vehicle 
  to the appellant. However, when Pfaff effected the registration, the purchase 
  by Reynolds had not been concluded nor was it ever concluded. On being presented 
  with a copy of the Certificate of Registration of the vehicle in its name, the 
  appellant advanced the purchase funds to Reynolds.</p>
<p>[4] We do not agree with the application judge's finding that the conduct of 
  Pfaff was "not such as to preclude it from denying Reynolds' authority 
  to sell". In our respectful view, the application judge erred when he found 
  that "the appellant did not require any proof of title" as it is common 
  ground that Pfaff did, in fact cause the registration of the vehicle to be placed 
  in the appellant's name and that the Certificate of Registration was given to 
  the appellant. At the very least, this provided prima facie evidence from Pfaff 
  to the appellant that Reynolds had authority to sell the vehicle to it.</p>
<p>[5] The appeal is therefore allowed and it is declared that the appellant is 
  the true owner of the vehicle and is entitled to the proceeds of sale of the 
  vehicle.</p>
<p>[6] Given our decision with respect to the appeal, it is conceded by Pfaff 
  that the cross-appeal must be allowed. Pfaff is therefore ordered to pay VW 
  Credit the sum of $114.255.96.</p>
<p>[7] The appellant is entitled to its costs as against Pfaff fixed in the amount 
  of $10,000.00. There will be no order of costs with respect to the cross-appeal.</p>
