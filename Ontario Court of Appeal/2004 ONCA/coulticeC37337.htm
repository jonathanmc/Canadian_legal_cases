<p>On appeal from acquittals returned on October 31, 2001 by a jury presided over 
  by Justice B. Glass of the Superior Court of Justice.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  Overview</p>
<p>
  [1] A jury acquitted the respondents of criminal negligence causing death. The 
  charges arose out of the death of ten year old Elizabeth Harder who suffered 
  fatal head injuries after a fall from a horse during a trail ride. The respondent, 
  James Coultice (&#8220;Coultice&#8221;) was the owner of the trail ride operation. 
  The respondent, Scott Tarpey (&#8220;Tarpey&#8221;) worked for Coultice and 
  was in charge of the trail ride that ended with Elizabeth&#8217;s death. </p>
<p>
  [2] The Crown appealed from the acquittals alleging that the trial judge erred 
  in law in excluding evidence of three prior incidents involving the horse that 
  Elizabeth was riding on the day she died, and in excluding expert evidence as 
  to the manner in which to safely operate trail rides, especially those involving 
  novice riders. </p>
<p>
  [3] I would dismiss the appeal. The trial judge erred in excluding the evidence 
  of one of the three prior incidents involving the same horse, and he erred in 
  excluding the entirety of the evidence of two of the Crown experts. The Crown 
  has not, however, satisfied me to a reasonable degree of certainty that the 
  result would not necessarily have been the same had those errors not occurred.</p>
<p>
  The Evidence at Trial</p>
<p>
  [4] Elizabeth went horseback riding at Coultice&#8217;s Wagon Wheel Ranch with 
  a group of children celebrating a friend&#8217;s birthday on April 17, 1998. 
  Elizabeth had been on a horse once before in her life. She rode a horse called 
  Nevada and had no difficulties during the ride.</p>
<p>
  [5] Elizabeth had so much fun riding Nevada that she asked her parents to take 
  her back to the ranch the next day. She returned with her parents and her brother 
  and sister anxious to take another ride on Nevada. Paul Harder, Elizabeth&#8217;s 
  father, spoke to Coultice when he was paying for the rides and told him that 
  his children were all inexperienced riders. Elizabeth asked Coultice if she 
  could ride Nevada. Coultice said that Nevada was a popular horse who was very 
  gentle with children.</p>
<p>
  [6] Elizabeth was put on Nevada and Tarpey adjusted the saddle and stirrups. 
  She was wearing running shoes with no heels and was not wearing a helmet. No 
  one suggested to Elizabeth&#8217;s parents that she should wear a helmet and 
  heeled shoes. Elizabeth sat on Nevada for about ten minutes before a group of 
  15 to 20 riders left the stable area and headed out on the trail. Before the 
  group left, there were brief instructions on how to steer and stop the horses. 
  Tarpey was the only paid employee and trail guide on the ride. Five or six other 
  experienced riders served as volunteer guides.</p>
<p>
  [7] The trail ride followed an established route. The horses went up a hill, 
  through a wooded area to an open field. Usually, the horses went in single file 
  up the hill and through the wooded area. The horses were allowed to gallop in 
  the open field. After a brief rest, they were led up another hill and down the 
  hill to the barn and stable area. Changes in pace during the ride were signalled 
  by Tarpey. </p>
<p>
  [8] Andrea Ladner, an experienced rider, was on the trail ride with Elizabeth. 
  During the ride, Ms. Ladner heard Elizabeth cry out. She turned and saw Elizabeth 
  and Nevada approaching her at a fast trot. Elizabeth was holding the reins loosely 
  and did not seem to have control of Nevada. Ms. Ladner rode beside Elizabeth, 
  spoke to her and attempted to comfort her. Ms. Ladner did not see Tarpey approach 
  Elizabeth, say anything to her or do anything to address the problems that Elizabeth 
  was apparently having with Nevada. According to Ms. Ladner, Nevada was fidgety 
  and upset the horse in front of him.</p>
<p>
  [9] Shortly after Ms. Ladner spoke to Elizabeth, the group, including Elizabeth, 
  approached the top of the final hill leading down to the stable area. At the 
  top of the hill, Nevada bolted past the rest of the group. There was some evidence 
  that a dog was seen running very near the group of horses when Nevada bolted 
  and started down the hill. </p>
<p>
  [10] Nevada galloped down the hill towards the stable. Coultice saw Nevada coming 
  and yelled at Elizabeth to hang on. Elizabeth&#8217;s parents saw the horse 
  gallop by, recognized that Elizabeth was the rider and gave chase. Nevada made 
  a sharp turn and Elizabeth fell off to the left side of the horse. As Elizabeth 
  fell from the horse, her foot caught in the stirrup. Nevada dragged her for 
  hundreds of feet. Elizabeth struggled to free her foot until her head hit a 
  stump or a rock. She stopped moving. Eventually, Elizabeth&#8217;s foot came 
  loose from the stirrup and she fell to the ground. Elizabeth was rushed to the 
  hospital, but she had suffered massive head injuries and nothing could be done 
  to save her.</p>
<p>
  [11] In addition to the evidence of the events on the trail ride that ended 
  with Elizabeth&#8217;s death, the Crown sought to lead evidence of occurrences 
  on other trail rides at the ranch between 1998 and 2001. The Crown argued that 
  this evidence demonstrated that Nevada was not a suitable horse for Elizabeth, 
  that the respondents knew or should have known that Nevada was not suitable, 
  and that various practices followed on the trail rides were unsafe and exposed 
  the riders to unnecessary risks. The trial judge admitted evidence of four of 
  the occurrences, one of which involved Nevada. He excluded evidence of three 
  of the occurrences, all of which involved Nevada. This ruling gives rise to 
  the Crown&#8217;s first ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [12] The Crown also sought to lead expert evidence from three witnesses. The 
  Crown proposed to lead evidence of the procedures that should be followed when 
  operating trail rides, especially those involving young novice riders and the 
  appropriateness of some of the procedures followed by the respondents. The trial 
  judge excluded all of this evidence. This ruling gives rise to the Crown&#8217;s 
  second ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [13] Coultice testified. He had owned and operated the Wagon Wheel Ranch for 
  almost 50 years. Coultice acknowledged that as the owner of a business providing 
  trail rides, he had a duty of care to riders, including Elizabeth. He agreed 
  that he was obliged to provide those customers with a &#8220;reasonably safe 
  trail ride&#8221;. He further agreed that his duty included providing Elizabeth 
  with a suitable horse, giving her adequate instructions before the ride commenced, 
  and providing proper support and supervision during the ride. </p>
<p>
  [14] Coultice knew Elizabeth was a beginner and he agreed that she had to be 
  paired with a horse that had a docile and gentle disposition. This kind of horse 
  was referred to in the evidence as a &#8220;dead calm&#8221; horse. Mr. Coultice 
  testified that Nevada had been working on the ranch for two years and was known 
  to Mr. Coultice as a &#8220;dead calm&#8221; horse and a favourite of children. 
  </p>
<p>
  [15] Coultice was not on the trail ride and could not speak directly to what 
  happened. He testified, however, that to his knowledge nothing untoward had 
  happened. He and others testified that even the most gentle horse could become 
  &#8220;spooked&#8221; and bolt for no apparent reason. Coultice suggested that 
  this is what must have happened when Elizabeth lost control of Nevada. </p>
<p>
  [16] Tarpey did not testify. There was evidence, however, that he had worked 
  for Coultice for some 22 years and was highly regarded as a careful trail boss. 
  </p>
<p>
  Positions of the Parties at Trial </p>
<p> [17] The Crown&#8217;s case was based on the cumulative effect of numerous 
  alleged failings and inadequacies in the operation of the trail ride. Crown 
  counsel referred to 12 areas of the evidence in his closing argument. The conduct 
  which the Crown said demonstrated criminal negligence included: </p>
<ul>
  <li> placing Elizabeth on a horse that was not suitable for a ten year old novice 
    rider;</li>
  <li> failing to advise Elizabeth&#8217;s parents of the risks inherent in a 
    trail ride;</li>
  <li> failing to provide Elizabeth with adequate instruction before commencing 
    the trail ride;</li>
  <li> failing to ensure that Elizabeth was wearing a helmet and shoes with a 
    heel;</li>
  <li> failing to maintain proper supervision during the ride. Proper supervision 
    included controlling the speed of the horses, ensuring that they stayed in 
    a single file line, and addressing problems with horses when they arose in 
    the course of the ride;</li>
  <li> failing to properly keep the trail ride and stable area free of obstructions; 
    and</li>
  <li> failing to control the dogs who lived on the ranch.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [18] Counsel for Coultice contended that his client had fulfilled his duty to 
  Elizabeth and that if there were any shortcomings in the operation of the trail 
  ride, they did not reach the level required for a finding of criminal negligence. 
  Counsel further argued that it was not accepted practice in 1998 to require 
  all riders to wear helmets and heeled shoes and that in any event, the absence 
  of a helmet and heeled shoes did not contribute to Elizabeth&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>
  [19] Tarpey&#8217;s defence was similar to Coultice&#8217;s. Counsel for Tarpey 
  put it in these words: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Scott Tarpey is an experienced and careful trail boss who took a trail ride 
  on April 18, 1999. A horse known to be friendly, quiet, slow and even docile, 
  a horse for kids, and for beginners, for no apparent reason bolts out of a walking 
  line, the rider falls and is, I suggest to you, unpredictably and tragically 
  dragged to her death. This is an accident. It is a tragedy, but it&#8217;s an 
  accident.</p>
<p>The Grounds of Appeal</p>
<p> (A.) The Exclusion of Evidence of Nevada&#8217;s Disposition</p>
<p>
  [20] Nevada was a four year old Gelding in good health who was well cared for 
  and had no apparent vices. He had worked as a trail horse on the ranch for two 
  years. </p>
<p>
  [21] As indicated above, the respondents acknowledged that they had a duty to 
  match Elizabeth with a suitable horse and that given her age and inexperience 
  only a &#8220;dead calm&#8221; horse was suitable for her. The respondents contended 
  that Nevada fit that description. Several witnesses described Nevada as a docile, 
  if not, lazy horse and an appropriate mount for a young inexperienced rider. 
  It was the Crown&#8217;s position that Nevada was an unpredictable horse who 
  could be difficult to control on trail rides. In support of this position, the 
  Crown sought to lead evidence of four prior incidents that had occurred on trail 
  rides involving Nevada. The trial judge admitted only the evidence of the incident 
  involving Heather Scrivens. </p>
<p>
  [22] Heather Scrivens was a 12 year old novice rider. She rode Nevada on April 
  2, 1999, about two weeks before Elizabeth&#8217;s death. Ms. Scrivens testified 
  that she was not told that the horses would run in the course of the trail ride. 
  During the ride, Nevada and the other horses broke into a run, but Nevada did 
  not stop when the rest of the horses did. Ms. Scrivens tried to bring Nevada 
  to a stop by pulling on the reins, however, Nevada reacted by jerking his head 
  from side to side causing Ms. Scrivens to slip partially out of the saddle. 
  Tarpey, who was in charge of the ride, came to Ms. Scriven&#8217;s assistance 
  and told her to pull more gently on the reigns to make the horse stop. Ms. Scrivens 
  was very upset so Tarpey led her and Nevada back to the barn.</p>
<p>
  [23] The evidence excluded by the trial judge involved three separate incidents 
  that occurred within two weeks of Elizabeth&#8217;s death. </p>
<p>
  (i) The Watt Incident</p>
<p>
  [24] On April 5, 1999, Laura Watt, age 12, and some friends went to the Wagon 
  Wheel Ranch to trail ride. Ms. Watt had ridden a horse once before. Mr. Coultice 
  was present when Ms. Watt and her group arrived. Ms. Watt was paired with Nevada. 
  She was not shown how to control the horse or told what to expect on the trail 
  ride. Tarpey was the trail guide.</p>
<p>
  [25] During the trail ride, Ms. Watt and her friends wanted to make the horses 
  run. Nothing untoward happened during the first run. During a second run, Ms. 
  Watt noticed that one of her stirrups was loose. After a third run, she told 
  one of the guides about the stirrup. The guide told her not to worry about it 
  as there would be no more running on the ride. As the horses were walking down 
  the last hill toward the barn, Ms. Watt felt something hit her left foot and 
  fall off. The object struck Nevada&#8217;s hoof causing him to rear-up on his 
  hind legs. Ms. Watt slipped partly out of the saddle, but remained on the horse. 
  Her right leg was on the saddle and her left leg was under Nevada&#8217;s belly. 
  Nevada ran in the direction of a fence. Ms. Watt jumped off as Nevada approached 
  the fence.</p>
<p>
  (ii) The Berkholz Incident</p>
<p>
  [26] The second incident occurred on April 11, 1999. David Berkholz, age 26, 
  and his girlfriend went riding at the ranch. Mr. Berkholz, who had no experience 
  riding horses, told the staff that he was a beginner. He was paired with Nevada. 
  According to Mr. Berkholz, he received no instructions about controlling the 
  horse on the ride until he specifically asked Tarpey for help. </p>
<p>
  [27] Mr. Berkholz testified that Nevada was not responding to his directions 
  during the early part of the ride. Berkholz felt that he did not have control 
  of Nevada. Despite this lack of control, Mr. Berkholz wanted Nevada to go fast. 
  With some encouragement, Nevada broke into a gallop. While Nevada was galloping, 
  Mr. Berkholz kicked the horse&#8217;s side several times. Nevada bucked backwards 
  causing Mr. Berkholz to lose his balance. He dove from the horse to the ground. 
  Tarpey chased after Nevada who ran off. Another guide admonished Mr. Berkholz 
  for kicking Nevada. Eventually, Tarpey returned with Nevada, Mr. Berkholz got 
  back on the horse and finished the ride.</p>
<p>
  (iii) The Tymburski Incident</p>
<p>
  [28] The third incident occurred on April 17, 1999, the day before Elizabeth&#8217;s 
  death. Katherine Tymburski, a teenager and experienced rider, took Nevada on 
  a trail ride. Tarpey was in charge of the trail ride and Coultice was in charge 
  at the ranch. </p>
<p>
  [29] Ms. Tymburski testified that Nevada and the other horses galloped four 
  or five times during the trail ride. She sensed that Nevada was uncomfortable 
  when he was close to other horses. Nevada bit one of the horses in front of 
  him. During one of the runs, Nevada swayed from side to side and Ms. Tymburski 
  feared that she might fall off of the horse. As they neared the end of the ride, 
  Ms. Tymburski mentioned to one of the guides that Nevada seemed to &#8220;act 
  weird around the horses, when the horses come up behind him&#8221;. She told 
  the guide that she had almost fallen off of Nevada. The guide smiled, said &#8220;Oh 
  really&#8221; and did not seem particularly concerned. Ms. Tymburski could not 
  identify the guide, but it was not Tarpey or Coultice.</p>
<p>
  [30] At trial, the Crown relied on the evidence of the three incidents described 
  above as evidence of Nevada&#8217;s disposition and also as part of the larger 
  package of evidence going to the allegedly negligent practices followed by Coultice 
  and Tarpey. The trial judge&#8217;s ruling addressed both bases upon which the 
  Crown sought to tender the evidence. On appeal, the Crown advances disposition 
  as the only ground of admissibility. </p>
<p>
  [31] The trial judge recognized that the evidence of the three incidents was 
  offered in part as evidence of Nevada&#8217;s disposition. He excluded the evidence 
  because in his opinion, the probative value on the question of Nevada&#8217;s 
  disposition did not outweigh the potential prejudicial effect of the evidence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [32] Mr. Lepofsky, Crown counsel, accepts that evidence is properly excluded 
  where its prejudicial potential outweighs its probative value. He also accepts 
  that the trial judge&#8217;s calculation of that balance is entitled to deference 
  in this court absent some error in principle or misapprehension of the evidence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [33] Insofar as the evidence of the Watt and Berkholz incidents is concerned, 
  I see no basis upon which to interfere with the trial judge&#8217;s ruling. 
  In assessing probative value, the trial judge observed that the evidence was 
  offered to show that Nevada was an unpredictable horse who was prone to engage 
  in unexplained and dangerous conduct during trail rides. The evidence involving 
  Watt and Berkholz was not evidence of unexplained conduct by Nevada. Nevada&#8217;s 
  conduct when being ridden by Watt was explained by the stirrup hitting his hoof, 
  and his conduct when being ridden by Berkholz was explained by Berkholz&#8217;s 
  mistreatment of Nevada. I think it was open to the trial judge to view this 
  evidence as suggesting nothing more than that Nevada could be &#8220;spooked&#8221; 
  if struck unexpectedly on the hoof or repeatedly kicked by his rider. Viewed 
  in this light, the evidence added very little to the Crown&#8217;s case.</p>
<p>
  [34] The trial judge also found that the evidence of Watt and Berkholz carried 
  some prejudicial potential in that the jury might draw the unwarranted inference 
  that Nevada was an unsuitable horse for Elizabeth from the mere fact that Nevada 
  had bolted on prior occasions without regard to the explanations for Nevada&#8217;s 
  conduct. I think it was open to the trial judge to make this finding, although 
  the factors which tend to minimize the potential probative value of the evidence 
  also tend to reduce its potential prejudicial effect. These incidents were so 
  different from that involving Elizabeth, it is most unlikely that the evidence 
  would have assisted the jury.</p>
<p>
  [35] The evidence of the Tymburski incident stands on a different footing. Ms. 
  Tymburski gave evidence that Nevada was difficult to control on the trail ride 
  the day before Elizabeth&#8217;s death. Unlike the Watt and Berkholz incidents, 
  there was no explanation offered for Nevada&#8217;s behaviour. This evidence 
  did suggest that Nevada was not a &#8220;dead calm&#8221; horse, but was in 
  fact difficult to handle on trail rides. </p>
<p>
  [36] The trial judge found that Ms. Tymburski&#8217;s evidence had very little 
  probative value because she was not a novice rider and was not, therefore, in 
  the same position as a person like Elizabeth. I cannot agree with this analysis. 
  The evidence was offered to show that Nevada was not a &#8220;dead calm&#8221; 
  horse. The fact that Ms. Tymburski was an experienced rider, but was still having 
  difficulty controlling Nevada on a trail ride, added probative value to the 
  evidence as it related to Nevada&#8217;s disposition and the Crown&#8217;s contention 
  that Nevada was not a suitable horse for a young novice rider. </p>
<p>
  [37] The trial judge erred in holding that the probative value of Ms. Tymburski&#8217;s 
  evidence on the issue of Nevada&#8217;s disposition was diminished because she 
  was an experienced rider. This error skewed the probative value/prejudicial 
  effect analysis and led to the improper exclusion of the evidence. I will address 
  the effect of this error later in these reasons. </p>
<p> (B.) The Exclusion of the Expert Evidence</p>
<p>
  [38] At trial, the Crown sought to lead evidence from three experts. The trial 
  judge was invited to determine the admissibility of this evidence on the basis 
  of the testimony the three experts had given at the preliminary inquiry. The 
  trial judge excluded the evidence of all three witnesses. On appeal, the Crown 
  argues that the trial judge erred in excluding the expert opinion evidence of 
  Bruce Brown and Katrina Gaul. The Crown does not dispute the exclusion of the 
  evidence of the third expert.</p>
<p>
  [39] Mr. Brown and Ms. Gaul had extensive experience in the operation of trail 
  rides and equally extensive backgrounds in relation to safety issues relating 
  to horseback riding in general and trail rides in particular. The Crown argued 
  that their evidence was relevant to the safety procedures which reasonable trail 
  ride operators should follow when conducting trail rides, particularly when 
  those rides included young, inexperienced riders. The Crown argued that the 
  experts&#8217; evidence could assist the jury in determining whether the respondents 
  met that standard and, if not, whether their conduct showed a marked departure 
  from the expected norm. </p>
<p>
  [40] The trial judge rejected the experts&#8217; evidence because it did not 
  meet the necessity criterion for the admissibility of expert opinion evidence. 
  He came to that conclusion for two reasons. First, the trial judge held that 
  the expert evidence was directed at &#8220;ideal standards for an industry that 
  is unregulated&#8221;, rather than at the standard which the jury would apply 
  when determining whether the Crown had proven criminal negligence. Second, the 
  trial judge held that the evidence was unnecessary in the sense that it would 
  not assist the jury in resolving the relevant issues. The trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There is no need for expert opinion evidence for a jury to determine whether 
  the defendants failed to do what was their duty and whether or not such failure 
  displayed wanton or reckless disregard for the life of Elizabeth Harder. There 
  were others present who saw the accident. Some were on the same trail with Elizabeth. 
  The method used by the defendants in assigning horses to customers and the procedure 
  used on the trail ride are before the jury. </p>
<p>
  [41] I disagree with both conclusions. The evidence of Brown and Gaul does not, 
  except perhaps in a few isolated areas, address the ideal way to operate a trail 
  ride, but speaks to what these witnesses regarded as safe and unsafe practices 
  in the operation of trail rides. Even if some parts of their evidence drifted 
  to a description of an ideal standard, those parts could have been excluded 
  without ruling all of the witnesses&#8217; evidence inadmissible.</p>
<p>
  [42] Further, the availability of witnesses who gave firsthand testimony of 
  the relevant events and the respondents&#8217; practices on trail rides did 
  not render the expert evidence unnecessary. Expert evidence assumes that evidence 
  of the primary facts has been or will be adduced. Expert evidence provides evidence 
  by way of the expert&#8217;s opinion as to the inference that should be drawn 
  from the primary facts. Experts are allowed to give their opinion because the 
  trier of fact is not likely to have the requisite expertise and, therefore, 
  not likely to draw the appropriate inference from the primary facts: R. v. Mohan 
  (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 402 at 412-13 (S.C.C.). Firsthand evidence of the events 
  leading to Elizabeth&#8217;s death, and evidence of the procedures and practices 
  routinely followed by the respondents when conducting trail rides not only did 
  not render expert evidence unnecessary, but was a precondition to its admissibility.</p>
<p>
  [43] The necessity requirement as applied to the admissibility of expert evidence 
  serves as a screen to exclude evidence that will potentially do more harm than 
  good to the fact finding process. The necessity inquiry is directed at the extent 
  to which the proffered evidence will assist the trier of fact in arriving at 
  an accurate factual inference balanced against the risks and costs associated 
  with the admission of expert evidence. When courts speak of expert evidence 
  as being necessary, they are in fact saying the potential of the evidence to 
  assist the trier of fact in drawing the correct inference outweighs the risks 
  and costs associated with the admission of that kind of evidence.</p>
<p>
  [44] Three formulations of the necessity requirement were described in R. v. 
  K.(A.) (1999), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at 265 (Ont. C.A.). For present purposes, 
  the second and third descriptions are apt: </p>
<p class="indent"> Will it provide information which is likely to be outside the 
  experience of the trier of fact? or</p>
<p class="indent">Is the trier of fact unlikely to form a correct judgment about 
  a matter in issue if unassisted by the expert opinion evidence?</p>
<p>
  [45] Much of the evidence offered by the two experts meets the necessity requirement 
  as described above. While it is fair to say that some of their opinions would 
  have been self-evident to any reasonable trier of fact and could, therefore, 
  be described as unnecessary, other parts of their opinions were well beyond 
  the experience of average triers of fact. For example, these witnesses would 
  have testified as to the appropriate instructions to be given to novice riders 
  before a trail ride was commenced. They would also have given evidence as to 
  the manner in which trail rides should be safely organized and supervised. I 
  do not think that these are subject matters upon which average jurors could 
  come to an informed conclusion without expert assistance. </p>
<p>
  [46] I am satisfied that much of the evidence of Brown and Gaul met the necessity 
  criterion and should have been admitted by the trial judge. He erred in law 
  in excluding the entirety of their evidence. </p>
<p> (C.) The Effect of the Errors</p>
<p>
  [47] The Crown has demonstrated errors in law. It is entitled to a new trial, 
  however, only if it can demonstrate with a reasonable degree of certainty that 
  the verdicts would not necessarily have been the same had the errors not been 
  made: R. v. Morin (1998), 44 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 221 (S.C.C.); R. v. Evans (1993), 
  82 C.C.C. (3d) 338 at 350 (S.C.C.); R. v. Watkins (2003), 181 C.C.C. (3d) 78 
  at 96 (Ont. C.A.). I do not think the Crown has met its burden. I will address 
  the effect of the two errors individually bearing in mind, however, that it 
  is the cumulative effect of the errors which must be considered.</p>
<p>
  (i) The Tymburski Incident</p>
<p>
  [48] Insofar as the Crown&#8217;s case was based on the suitability of Nevada 
  as a horse for a young rider, the Crown had to show that Nevada was unsuitable 
  and that the respondents knew he was unsuitable, or had failed to make the necessary 
  inquiry to determine Nevada&#8217;s suitability. Ms. Tymburski&#8217;s evidence 
  would have provided some assistance to the Crown on the first of these issues. 
  Her evidence did not, however, implicate either respondent. There was no evidence 
  that the respondents knew of the incident involving Ms. Tymburski. Nor, in my 
  view, could the Crown successfully argue that they should have known about the 
  incident. It was a single, relatively innocuous event which precipitated only 
  a brief, casual comment to somebody by Ms. Tymburski. Without evidence that 
  the respondents knew of the Tymburski incident or ought to have known about 
  it, there is no realistic possibility that evidence of the incident would have 
  made any difference to the verdicts. </p>
<p>
  (ii) The Expert Evidence</p>
<p>
  [49] My reading of the evidence of Brown and Gaul leaves me unconvinced that 
  it could have made a difference in the result. I come to that conclusion for 
  four reasons. First, much of their evidence amounted to expressions of personal 
  experiences and preferences and did not address the appropriate standard of 
  conduct or the reasonableness of the respondents&#8217; conduct. For example, 
  the witnesses spoke of how they trained guides for trail rides and how they 
  positioned guides in the course of trail rides. They did not, however, purport 
  to describe an appropriate standard of care or to measure the respondents&#8217; 
  conduct against that standard. </p>
<p>
  [50] Second, various parts of the evidence offered by the experts addressed 
  factors which were irrelevant to the facts of this case. For example, one of 
  the experts spoke of the need for an appropriate first aid kit on a trail ride. 
  The presence or absence of a first aid kit had nothing to do with this case.</p>
<p>
  [51] Third, some of the evidence offered by the experts would not have furthered 
  the Crown&#8217;s case. For example, the experts&#8217; evidence as to whether 
  helmets and heeled shoes were required on trail rides in April 1999 fell well 
  short of the assertion that the failure to require riders to wear helmets and 
  heeled shoes fell below accepted safety practices in April 1999. </p>
<p>
  [52] Fourth, some of the evidence was unnecessary. Both experts spoke at some 
  length about the importance of matching a horse to a rider, particularly where 
  the rider was inexperienced. However, the respondents acknowledged their obligation 
  to match the horse to the rider and conceded that Elizabeth had to be matched 
  with a &#8220;dead calm&#8221; horse because of her age and inexperience. Battle 
  was joined primarily on the question of whether Nevada fit that description. 
  The experts&#8217; evidence as to how horses should be matched to riders would 
  not have assisted the jury on this crucial question. </p>
<p>
  [53] Viewing this trial with the benefit of hindsight, I think it came down 
  to a single issue &#8211; Did the Crown prove beyond a reasonable doubt that 
  the respondents were criminally negligent in allowing Elizabeth to take Nevada 
  on the trail ride? The answer turned on the resolution of two factual issues 
  &#8211; Did the Crown prove that Nevada was not a &#8220;dead calm&#8221; horse, 
  and did the Crown prove that the respondents knew or ought to have known that 
  Nevada did not fit that description. The Crown has not satisfied me to a reasonable 
  degree of certainty that the answers to both questions would not necessarily 
  have been the same had the improperly excluded evidence been heard by the jury.</p>
<p> [54] I would dismiss the appeal. </p>
