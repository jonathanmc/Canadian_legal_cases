<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We called on the Crown to deal with four of the appellant's grounds of 
  appeal. </p>
<p>
  Reasonable Doubt </p>
<p>
  [2] The first is that he failed to instruct the jury in accordance with R. v. 
  W.(D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.) In particular, he argues that the 
  failure to refer to the second branch of the W.(D.) test, in a case where the 
  accused testified, was fatal. </p>
<p>
  [3] While the trial judge did not use the specific language from W.(D.), he 
  made repeated reference to the presumption of innocence and the burden on the 
  Crown to establish the appellant's guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt". 
  Defence counsel, who fully reviewed the W.(D.) test in his closing argument, 
  raised no objection to this portion of the charge.</p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge reviewed the trial testimony of the appellant in detail, 
  and repeated the principles of the Crown's burden and the presumption of innocence 
  just before the jury retired to deliberate. This, coupled with defence counsel's 
  clear statement of the W.(D.) test and his failure to object, lead us to conclude, 
  looking at the jury instructions as a whole, that the jury was not misled as 
  to the "correct burden and standard of proof to apply" (W.(D.) at 
  p. 409).</p>
<p>
  Out-of-Court Confessions</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant also argued, as he did at trial, that the trial judge erred 
  in instructing the jury on how to assess the appellant's out-of-court confessions. 
  This error, the appellant argues, violates the requirement in R. v. MacKenzie 
  (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) that a jury be given guidance from a trial 
  judge on how to assess contradictory statements when a previous out-of-court 
  statement is at odds with the accused's testimony and other evidence at trial.</p>
<p>
  [6] In our view, the trial judge made no error in not specifically instructing 
  the jury that they were obliged to reject the appellant's out-of-court confessions 
  if they had a reasonable doubt as to their accuracy. This is so especially where, 
  as here, the jury received proper instruction on reasonable doubt from the trial 
  judge and a fair and balanced instruction on how to approach this evidence. 
  See R. v. White and Cote (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.) at paras. 51-52. 
  Most significantly, the trial judge never told the jury they had to choose one 
  version of the appellant's evidence over the other.</p>
<p>
  Cross-examination of Sgt. Leppert</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant also argued that he was improperly prevented from cross-examining 
  Sgt. Leppert on comments that Sgt. Leppert made during the preamble to the appellant's 
  videotaped interrogation on February 10, 1999 and July 12, 1999. He submitted 
  that the resulting prejudice to the appellant was that the jury would not otherwise 
  appreciate why the appellant took responsibility for the murder in his phone 
  calls from the jail.</p>
<p>
  [8] At the opening of the trial, the defence objected to the admissibility of 
  these statements, resulting in the Crown's agreement not to tender them into 
  evidence. The appellant's counsel then attempted, at trial, to cross-examine 
  Sgt. Leppert in connection with only part of the statements, and, in particular, 
  only his, not the appellant's, comments. </p>
<p>
  [9] We see no prejudice to the appellant since he himself gave this very evidence 
  and was not challenged by the Crown on it. No harm was done.</p>
<p>
  Impermissible Inferences</p>
<p>
  [10] Finally, the appellant argued that the trial judge failed to caution the 
  jury that there was no evidence capable of supporting the Crown's theories that 
  the appellant had a key, used a lock-pick device, or could have entered the 
  apartment through the windows. At trial, defence counsel objected to leaving 
  these impermissible inferences with the jury. </p>
<p>
  [11] We do not agree that there was no evidence to support the Crown's theories 
  of possible entry.</p>
<p>
  [12] The evidence from Kim Meisel was that a set of the victim's keys attached 
  to a "ball bearing" style key chain, was missing. This evidence, along 
  with evidence of the appellant's prior friendship with the victim and his intercepted 
  statements that he entered her apartment through the locked door, which he said 
  he locked on his way out, were capable of supporting the Crown's theory that 
  the appellant could have gained access through the locked main doors.</p>
<p>
  [13] The Crown's alternative theory about the use of a lock-pick device was 
  supported by the evidence of "Wigger's" involvement on the night of 
  the murder, of the appellant's and Terry Lyon's evidence that the appellant 
  knew how to pick a lock, and the appellant's evidence that he entered and left 
  the apartment through the locked main door.</p>
<p>
  [14] As for the window entry, there was evidence from the police, including 
  a video re?enactment, of how easily someone could gain entry into the victim's 
  apartment through the unlockable bedroom windows by climbing up a nearby pole 
  onto a low roof at the back of the building. The windows were open on the night 
  of the fire, there were scuffmarks on the back wall of the addition, and there 
  was evidence that a previous tenant's boyfriend had used this method to sneak 
  into the apartment. </p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [15] We see no errors raised by the remaining grounds of appeal. We would, accordingly, 
  dismiss the appeal.</p>
