<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Maurice C. Cullity of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated February 21, 2003, reported at (2003), 223 D.L.R. (4th) 733.</p>
<p>
  BLAIR J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The task facing a judge who is required to determine whether a deceased 
  person has made adequate provision for the proper support of his or her dependants 
  is a difficult and delicate one when the estate is not large enough to satisfy 
  the competing legal and moral claims of all dependants. This is particularly 
  so where the needs of one dependant far outstrip the capacity of the estate 
  to respond to them fully. The case before us exemplifies this dilemma. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellants argue that the deceased, Bruce Norton Cummings, did not make 
  adequate provision in his will for the proper support of his dependant adult 
  children, Paul and Elizabeth. They applied to Cullity J. for dependants' relief 
  pursuant to Part V of the Succession Law Reform Act R.S.O. 1990, c. s. 26, as 
  amended (&quot;the Act&quot;). They were successful, but not to the extent they 
  had hoped.</p>
<p>
  [3] On this appeal, the appellants seek to have the judgment varied to provide 
  for a greater quantum of dependants' relief and for a larger amount of support 
  arrears. They also seek leave to appeal from the decision of the application 
  judge to award no costs and, if leave be granted, to appeal from that order.</p>
<p>
  Issues</p>
<p>
  [4] There are three issues to be dealt with: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) Did the application judge err in limiting arrears of support 
  to the date of Mr. Cummings death rather than making the arrears payable to 
  the date of the Application? </p>
<p class="indent">(b) Did the application judge err in the exercise of his discretion 
  under s. 58 of the Succession Law Reform Act by failing to fix a larger amount 
  for dependants' relief, given particularly the needs of his son, Paul?</p>
<p class="indent">(c) Did the application judge err in failing to award costs 
  to the applicants?</p>
<p>
  [5] I would answer all three questions in the negative and dismiss the appeal 
  for the reasons that follow.</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [6] Paul and Elizabeth Cummings were 24 and 18 years of age, respectively, at 
  the time of their father's death. It is agreed they both are &quot;dependants&quot; 
  of Mr. Cummings within the meaning of the Act. </p>
<p>
  [7] At the time of the Application, Elizabeth had graduated from a course in 
  social work at Sheridan College and was in the process of completing a degree 
  course in social welfare at Nipissing University. She hoped to enroll in a graduate 
  program in social work at Wilfred Laurier University, which would take two years 
  to complete. </p>
<p>
  [8] Paul is a university graduate. He has a degree in Business Marketing and 
  Administration and has completed courses in psychology and sociology at Trent 
  University. Sadly, however, he suffers from a progressively debilitating neuromuscular 
  disease known as Becker's muscular dystrophy, for which there is no known cure. 
  No one contests the serious nature of this disease. It affects every muscle 
  in his body, particularly his heart and lungs. As the application judge described 
  it: </p>
<p class="indent">
  He suffers from weakness in his joints, including his knees. He is liable to 
  fall and unable to run. He has difficulty rising to his feet from a sitting 
  position and in ascending, and descending, stairs. Paul still drives a motor 
  vehicle but has required - or will soon require - special attachments to enable 
  him to continue to do this. He lives with his mother and it is anticipated that 
  expensive renovations to the house will be required as his illness progresses. 
  Although his life expectancy is considered to be normal, it is anticipated that 
  he will be confined to a wheelchair before he is 40 years of age.</p>
<p>[9] It is the poignancy and need of Paul's situation that underlies the Application 
  and this appeal. His condition has deteriorated since his father's death. While 
  he was at one time fully employed, he has not been able to sustain that employment 
  and is now attempting to work part time from home, but without much success. 
  His prospects for long-term employment are not good. Expensive modifications 
  to the home will be necessary to accommodate his needs. He will eventually require 
  full-time attention. Everyone agrees that the costs of Paul's future care will 
  far exceed the value of Mr. Cummings' estate.</p>
<p>
  [10] Paul and Elizabeth are the children of Mr. Cummings and his first wife, 
  the appellant Mary Cummings.</p>
<p>
  [11] Bruce and Mary Cummings were married in 1968. They separated in 1986 and 
  were divorced in January 1992. The divorce judgment incorporated the terms of 
  a separation agreement providing, amongst other things, for Mr. Cummings to 
  pay Mary Cummings support for the children in the amount of $2,000 per month, 
  and recognizing that &quot;Paul may continue to be a child of the marriage and 
  in possible need of support throughout the rest of his life, as a result of 
  his disease&quot;. The agreement also specified that it would survive the death 
  of a party, was binding on heirs and executors, and, particularly, that Mr. 
  Cummings' obligation to pay support would survive his death and be a first charge 
  on his estate. </p>
<p>
  [12] Mr. Cummings met the respondent, Ruta Cummings, in 1986. In 1988 they began 
  to live together in a common-law relationship. They were married in October 
  1997. At about the same time Mr. Cummings was diagnosed with terminal cancer, 
  and he died about 9 months later. The relationship between Mr. Cummings and 
  the respondent was an enduring, intimate and loving one.</p>
<p>
  [13] Mr. Cummings was employed in the publishing industry for many years. At 
  the time of the divorce and separation agreement he was earning approximately 
  $300,000 a year. In 1994, however, his employment was terminated, and although 
  he received a handsome severance package of approximately $450,000 his money 
  ran out in 1996. He was never successful thereafter in his attempts to establish 
  a viable consulting business. In 1996 his income was about $12,000, and in 1997 
  it was $1,473.</p>
<p>
  [14] Ruta Cummings is, and has been, employed in the computer software industry. 
  There is no evidence as to her level of earnings, but she deposed that she was 
  &quot;presently capable of earning an income capable of providing adequately 
  for [her] support&quot;. Neither she nor Mary Cummings advanced any claim for 
  dependants' relief. The respondent's evidence is that she and the deceased &quot;contributed 
  approximately equal amounts to the maintenance of the household, including all 
  general household expenses and mortgage, insurance and property taxes on [their] 
  home and [their] cottage and [their] automobiles&quot; from the commencement 
  of their relationship. There is nothing in the record to contradict this. Indeed, 
  from about mid-1996 until Mr. Cummings' death, it was Ruta Cummings who was 
  the breadwinner in the family. She contributed to the support payments made 
  by Mr. Cummings under the divorce judgment. Following his death, she paid the 
  sum of $600 per month for support of the children, out of her own pocket.</p>
<p>
  [15] Mary Cummings is a Vice-Principal at a Junior School. She earns approximately 
  $76,000 per year. Mary Cummings has contributed to her daughter's tuition of 
  about $5,000 for two years at Sheridan College and about $8,200 for two years 
  at Nipissing University.</p>
<p>
  [16] Mr. Cummings' last will and testament was executed on December 15, 1997. 
  The respondent was named his executrix and trustee. A codicil to the will was 
  executed on June 2, 1998. In the will and codicil Mr. Cummings recognized he 
  had obligations to his dependant children after his death. He directed that 
  a testamentary trust in the amount of $125,000 be established to provide support 
  payments in the amount of $600 per month, reducing to $400 when either child 
  ceased to be a dependant. Should the support obligations be terminated, the 
  will provided that any remaining amount was to be split equally between Paul 
  and Elizabeth, or the survivor. </p>
<p>
  [17] The application judge found that the net value of the estate, for purposes 
  of the dependants' relief application, was about $637,500. Counsel now agree 
  the correct figure is approximately $650,000. The total estate, for these purposes, 
  is comprised of the testamentary estate itself, valued at approximately $135,000, 
  and other assets that by virtue of s. 72 of the Act are deemed to be available 
  for purposes of valuing the estate and supporting a charge to secure payment 
  of a dependants' relief order (the &quot;notional assets&quot;). The other assets 
  in question consist of the matrimonial home of Mr. Cummings and the respondent, 
  a cottage property in the Parry Sound area - both held jointly by Mr. Cummings 
  and the respondent - and the proceeds of Mr. Cummings' RRSP, of which the respondent 
  is the direct beneficiary.</p>
<p>
  [18] In his decision the application judge found that Mr. Cummings had not adequately 
  provided for the proper support of his dependant children by establishing the 
  $125,000 testamentary trust. He concluded in all the circumstances that the 
  level of support should be set at $250,000 payable by way of lump sum to Mary 
  Cummings in trust &quot;to be applied to a maximum of $10,000 for Elizabeth's 
  expenses of completing her Master's degree at Wilfred Laurier University and 
  the remaining amount to be held in trust to apply so much of the income, and 
  to the extent it is insufficient, the capital, for the care and welfare of Paul 
  Cummings during his life&quot;. He also directed, as previously indicated, that 
  support arrears in the amount of $53,256.08, calculated to the date of Mr. Cummings' 
  death, be paid to Mary Cummings.</p>
<p>
  [19] It is from these determinations that the applicants appeal.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  Arrears of Support</p>
<p>
  [20] In 1996 Mr. Cummings reduced the amount of his monthly payments under the 
  divorce judgment and separation agreement from $2000 to $378. The reduction 
  corresponded to the dramatic decrease in his income earning capacity following 
  the termination of his employment in 1994. Mary Cummings never objected to the 
  reduced support payments while Mr. Cummings was alive, nor did she ever indicate 
  she was waiving her rights to any arrears of support. </p>
<p>
  [21] The application judge considered, and rejected, the argument that there 
  had been an express or implied agreement between Mr. Cummings and Mary Cummings 
  reducing the support obligation from $2,000 per month to $378, notwithstanding 
  the previous pattern to that effect following Mr. Cummings' loss of employment. 
  He concluded that if Mr. Cummings had applied to vary the support payments and 
  rescind arrears in 1997, shortly before his diagnosis, he would likely have 
  obtained such an order. However, Mr. Cummings did not do so. In all the circumstances, 
  the application judge found that there were arrears of support, and that the 
  estate was large enough to pay those arrears, which constituted a judgment debt 
  and a first charge against the estate. He granted judgment to Mary Cummings 
  in the amount of $53,255.99 for arrears of support and special expenses to the 
  date of Mr. Cummings' death. </p>
<p>
  [22] In making this order, the application judge recognized that the Separation 
  Agreement was intended by its own language to survive the death of a party, 
  and to be binding on the deceased's heirs, executors, administrators and assigns; 
  moreover, it expressly provided that Mr. Cummings' obligation to pay support 
  would survive his death and would be a first charge on his estate. He therefore 
  correctly held that the support arrears constituted a first charge against the 
  estate. </p>
<p>
  [23] Given the language of the Separation Agreement and the provisions of the 
  divorce judgment, the estate continued to be subject to an ongoing obligation 
  to pay support in the amount of $2,000 per month, unless otherwise varied by 
  court order. The appellants elected not to rely on that obligation, however, 
  but rather to seek dependants' relief under the Act, for the period following 
  Mr. Cummings' death. Having chosen this route, however, the appellants opened 
  it up to the application judge to exercise his discretion in balancing all of 
  the factors relevant to how the assets in the estate were to be allocated, just 
  as he would have been able to do had he been considering an application to vary 
  the support provisions in the Separation Agreement and divorce judgment. </p>
<p>
  [24] Leaving aside Mr. Cummings' death, had there been an application to vary 
  and to rescind arrears, a judge would have been entitled to take into consideration 
  all of the changed circumstances in determining the extent to which arrears 
  should be paid. The application judge in effect did the same thing. He was clearly 
  alive to the limited resources of Mr. Cummings' estate in providing for his 
  dependants' needs. He declined to grant prejudgment interest on the arrears 
  he did award, undoubtedly with that in mind. It is noteworthy, as counsel for 
  the appellants candidly conceded, that any increase in the arrears payable might 
  well require a downward adjustment in any dependants' relief order made in favour 
  of the children. </p>
<p>
  [25] In my view, the application judge was entitled on the record before him, 
  to exercise his discretion in limiting the arrears of support to the date of 
  death, and to deal with the allocation of the assets of the estate in the post-death 
  era on the basis of dependants' relief principles.</p>
<p>Dependants' Relief under the Succession Law Reform Act</p>
<p>
  [26] In determining the allocation of the testator's estate for dependants' 
  relief purposes, the application judge took into account not only the needs 
  of Paul and Elizabeth but also the moral obligations of Mr. Cummings towards 
  his dependants, including his second wife, Ruta Cummings. He did so even though 
  the Respondent was admittedly not in need of support at the time and was not 
  claiming relief under the Act. In my view, he was entitled to do so. </p>
<p>
  [27] When judging whether a deceased has made adequate provision for the proper 
  support of his or her dependants and, if not, what order should be made under 
  the Act, a court must examine the claims of all dependants, whether based on 
  need or on legal or moral and ethical obligations. This is so by reason of the 
  dictates of the common law and the provisions of sections 57 through 62 of the 
  Act.</p>
<p>
  [28] Sections 58 and 60 of the Succession Law Reform Act state, in part: </p>
<p class="indent"> 58(1) Where a deceased, whether testate or intestate, has not 
  made adequate provision for the proper support of his dependants or any of them, 
  the court, on application, may order that such provision as it considers adequate 
  be made out of the estate of the deceased for the proper support of the dependants 
  or any of them.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) An application for an order for support of a dependant may 
  be made by the dependant or the dependant's parent.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The adequacy of provision for support under subsection (1) 
  shall be determined as of the date of the hearing of the application.</p>
<p class="indent">60(2) Where an application for an order under section 58 is 
  made by or on behalf of any dependant,</p>
<p class="indent">a) it may be dealt with by the court as</p>
<p class="indent">b) </p>
<p class="indent">an application made on behalf of all persons who might apply.</p>
<p>
  [29] Here, the application is made by Paul Cummings on his own behalf and by 
  Mary Cummings on behalf of Elizabeth. It is conceded that Paul and Elizabeth 
  are dependants as that term is defined under section 57 the Act, which states: </p>
<p class="indent"> &quot;dependant&quot; means,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the spouse of the deceased,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) a parent of the deceased,</p>
<p class="indent">(c) a child of the deceased, or</p>
<p class="indent">(d) a brother or sister of the deceased,</p>
<p class="indent">to whom the deceased was providing support or was under a legal 
  obligation to provide support immediately before his or her death.</p>
<p>
  [30] Neither Mary Cummings nor Ruta Cummings sought relief on the application. 
  They are &quot;dependants&quot;, however, and their interests may properly be 
  taken into account by the judge hearing the application, in accordance with 
  subsection 60(2)(a) above.</p>
<p>
  [31] The factors to be considered by the court on an application under section 
  58 are set out in section 62: </p>
<p class="indent"> 62.(1) In determining the amount and duration, if any, of support, 
  the court shall consider all the circumstances of the application, including,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the dependant's current assets and means;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the assets and means that the dependant is likely to have 
  in the future;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the dependant's capacity to contribute to his or her own 
  support;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the dependant's age and physical and mental health;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) the dependant's needs, in determining which the court shall 
  have regard to the dependant's accustomed standard of living;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) the measures available for the dependant to become able 
  to provide for his or her own support and the length of time and cost involved 
  to enable the dependant to take those measures;</p>
<p class="indent">(g) the proximity and duration of the dependant's relationship 
  with the deceased;</p>
<p class="indent">(h) the contributions made by the dependant to the deceased's 
  welfare, including indirect and non-financial contributions;</p>
<p class="indent">(i) the contributions made by the dependant to the acquisition, 
  maintenance and improvement of the deceased's property or business;</p>
<p class="indent">(j) a contribution by the dependant to the realization of the 
  deceased's career potential;</p>
<p class="indent">(k) whether the dependant has a legal obligation to provide 
  support for another person;</p>
<p class="indent">(l) the circumstances of the deceased at the time of death;</p>
<p class="indent">(m) any agreement between the deceased and the dependant;</p>
<p class="indent">(n) any previous distribution or division of property made by 
  the deceased in favour of the dependant by gift or agreement or under court 
  order;</p>
<p class="indent">(o) the claims that any other person may have as a dependant;</p>
<p class="indent">(p) if the dependant is a child, </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) the child's aptitude for and reasonable prospects of obtaining 
  an education, and</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) the child's need for a stable environment;</p>
<p class="indent"> (q) if the dependant is a child of the age of sixteen years 
  or more, whether the child has withdrawn from parental control;</p>
<p class="indent"> (r) if the dependant is a spouse or same-sex partner,</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) a course of conduct by the spouse or same-sex partner during 
  the deceased's lifetime that is so unconscionable as to constitute an obvious 
  and gross repudiation of the relationship,</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) the length of time the spouses or same-sex partners cohabited,</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) the effect on the spouse's or same-sex partner's earning 
  capacity of the responsibilities assumed during cohabitation,</p>
<p class="indent"> (iv) whether the spouse or same-sex partner has undertaken 
  the care of a child who is of the age of eighteen years or over and unable by 
  reason of illness, disability or other cause to withdraw from the charge of 
  his or her parents,</p>
<p class="indent"> (v) whether the spouse or same-sex partner has undertaken to 
  assist in the continuation of a program of education for a child eighteen years 
  of age or over who is unable for that reason to withdraw from the charge of 
  his or her parents,</p>
<p class="indent"> (vi) in the case of a spouse, any housekeeping, child care 
  or other domestic service performed by the spouse for the family, as if the 
  spouse had devoted the time spent in performing that service in remunerative 
  employment and had contributed the earnings to the family's support,</p>
<p class="indent"> (vi.1) in the case of a same-sex partner, any housekeeping, 
  child care or other domestic service performed by the same-sex partner for the 
  deceased or the deceased's family, as if the same-sex partner had devoted the 
  time spent in performing that service in remunerative employment and had contributed 
  the earnings to the support of the deceased or the deceased's family,</p>
<p class="indent"> (vii) the effect on the spouse's or same-sex partner's earnings 
  and career development of the responsibility of caring for a child,</p>
<p class="indent"> (viii) the desirability of the spouse or same-sex partner remaining 
  at home to care for a child; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (s) any other legal right of the dependant to support, other 
  than out of public money. R.S.O. 1990, c. S.26, s. 62 (1); 1999, c. 6, s. 61 
  (1-3).</p>
<p>
  [32] After an analysis of various competing authorities, Cullity J. concluded 
  that an Ontario court is entitled under s. 58(1) of the Act to take into account 
  not only needs but, as well, the moral duties of a testator or testatrix towards 
  spouses and children, in arriving at an appropriate support order. He said (Reasons, 
  paragraph 48): </p>
<p class="indent">
  The issue of the weight to be given to moral considerations is relevant in this 
  case: it is posed quite directly by the Respondent's concession that she is 
  not in need of support. On a strictly needs-based approach, I might well be 
  justified in ordering that the entirety of the net testamentary estate be transferred 
  for the support of Paul and for the assets of the notional estate to be charged 
  for their full value. I do not think this would be a correct disposition of 
  the case. I believe that, apart from any residual value that is to be attributed 
  to freedom of testamentary disposition, and the direction in section 62(1)(k) 
  to consider the existence of a legal obligation to support another person, moral 
  considerations continue to have a part to play in the analysis although, if 
  due consideration is given to the differences in the wording of the legislation 
  of this province and that of British Columbia, they may not be given the same 
  significance as in the courts of the latter.</p>
<p>[33] Counsel accepted that the foregoing statement represents an accurate summary 
  of the law in Ontario. I agree, although I do not think the caveat that moral 
  considerations are of less significance in Ontario than in British Columbia 
  is necessary.</p>
<p>
  [34] The issue whether, and if so to what extent, moral or ethical considerations 
  may be taken into account on a dependant's relief application in Ontario has 
  not been dealt with at the appellate level since the enactment of subsection 
  58(1) in its present form in 1978, when the provisions of Part V of the Act 
  replaced the provisions of the former Dependants' Relief Act R.S.O. 1970, c. 
  126. In this case, the question is whether, in considering an application for 
  relief on behalf of one or more dependants, the court may take into account 
  not only the needs and means of those dependants but also the moral obligations 
  of the deceased person to another dependant who is not asserting need at the 
  time. The answer to this question must be &quot;yes&quot;; otherwise the court 
  might well make an order that would put the other dependant &quot;in need&quot; 
  and therefore trigger not only an injustice but also another series of court 
  proceedings to determine that issue. It is for this reason that the legislation 
  permits the court to treat the application as one brought on behalf of all dependants 
  (paragraph 60(2)(a)) and why, in subsection 62(1), the factors listed are a 
  m&eacute;lange of criteria based not only on needs and means but also on legal 
  and moral or ethical claims. </p>
<p>
  [35] Prior to 1978 it was well accepted in Canadian jurisprudence that moral 
  or ethical considerations were important in the application of dependants' relief 
  legislation. In Walker v. McDermott [1931] S.C.R. 94, Duff J observed: </p>
<p class="indent">
  What constitutes &quot;proper maintenance and support&quot; is a question to 
  be determined with reference to a variety of circumstances. It cannot be limited 
  to the bare necessities of existence. For the purpose of arriving at a conclusion, 
  the court on whom devolves the responsibility of giving effect to the statute, 
  would naturally proceed from the point of view of the judicious father of a 
  family seeking to discharge both his marital and his parental duty; and would 
  of course (looking at the matter from that point of view), consider the situation 
  of the child, wife or husband, and the standard of living to which, having regard 
  to this and the other circumstances, reference ought to be had. </p>
<p>
  [36] When analyzing the court's task in determining what is appropriate support, 
  many courts, including this one in Re Hull Estate [1943] O.R. 778, have followed 
  Bosch v. Perpetual Trustee Company, [1938] A.C. 463 (P.C.) in which Lord Romer 
  adopted the proposition that dependants' relief legislation is </p>
<p>
  designed to enforce the moral obligation of a testator to use his testamentary 
  powers for the purpose of making proper and adequate provision after his death 
  for the support of his wife and children, having regard to his means, to the 
  means and deserts of the several claimants, and to the relative urgency of the 
  various moral claims upon his bounty.</p>
<p>
  [37] Lord Romer relied as well on Re Allardice, Allardice v. Allardice (1910), 
  29 N.Z.L.R. 959 in support of his view that the Court's responsibility is to 
  consider whether there has been a breach of the testator's moral duty to his 
  dependants. In conclusion, he stated (at pp. 478-479) that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  . . . in every case the Court must place itself in the position of the testator 
  and consider what he ought to have done in all the circumstances of the case, 
  treating the testator for that purpose as a wise and just, rather than a fond 
  and foolish, husband or father.</p>
<p>
  [38] Following the legislative changes in 1978, however, there have been conflicting 
  decisions in Ontario as to the role of moral considerations in dependants' relief 
  applications. Authorities such as Richer v. Richer (1984), 17 E.T.R. 102 (Ont. 
  Co. Ct.), Shemesh v. Shemesh Estate [1992] O.J. No. 2724 (O.C.J.) and Kipp v. 
  Buck Estate [1993] O.J. No. 790 (O.C.J.) concluded such considerations remain 
  relevant. Earlier Surrogate Court cases took a different approach, however: 
  see McSween v. McSween Estate [1985] O.J. No. 1765, and Swire v. Swire Estate 
  [1986] O.J. No. 2023. In McSween, Carnwath J. said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I therefore conclude that in seeking the correct meaning to be ascribed to the 
  words &quot;proper support&quot;, in Ontario, under the Succession Law Reform 
  Act, primary importance must be attached to the economic situation of the dependant 
  at the time of the hearing as opposed to ethical or moral obligations to be 
  imputed to the deceased at whatever point in time. That is not to say that the 
  opening words of s. 62(1)(a) of the Act should be ignored; there is a requirement 
  to &quot;inquire into and consider all the circumstances of the application&quot;. 
  I find, however, that in determining the adequacy of proper support as a prerequisite 
  to the making of an order under s. 58(1) of the Act, that moral or ethical obligations 
  on the part of the deceased are subsidiary to the primary consideration of the 
  economic circumstances of all the parties who would be affected by any order 
  made pursuant to s. 58. </p>
<p>
  [39] Carnwath J. also suggested that a re-examination of the &quot;time-honoured 
  precept&quot; of directing the judge to &quot;put himself in the place of the 
  testator&quot; might be justified as well.</p>
<p>
  [40] In my view these questions have been resolved by the decision of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in Tataryn v. Tataryn Estate [1994] 2 S.C.R. 807. There, the 
  Court held that a deceased's moral duty towards his or her dependants is a relevant 
  consideration on a dependants' relief application, and that judges are not limited 
  to conducting a needs-based economic analysis in determining what disposition 
  to make. In doing so, it rejected the argument that the &quot;judicious father 
  and husband&quot; test should be replaced with a needs-based analysis: see para. 
  23. I see no reason why the principles of Tataryn should not apply equally in 
  Ontario, even though they were enunciated in the context of the British Columbia 
  Wills Variation Act R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 435, in which the language is somewhat 
  different from that of the Succession Law Reform Act. </p>
<p>
  [41] Writing for a unanimous Court in that case, McLachlin J. based her decision 
  on three main underpinnings: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) First, she relied upon the broad wording of the British 
  Columbia legislation itself (which gives the court a wide discretion to make 
  provision out of the estate for whatever support it considers to be &quot;adequate, 
  just and equitable in the circumstances&quot; if the testator has not made &quot;adequate 
  provision for the proper maintenance and support of the testator's wife, husband 
  or children&quot;).</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Secondly, she examined the origins and objects of the statute 
  as dependants' relief legislation (designed to provide for the needs of spouses 
  and children by preventing them from becoming a charge on the state and by ensuring 
  that they receive an &quot;adequate, just and equitable&quot; share of the family 
  wealth on the death of the person who held it).</p>
<p class="indent">(c) Thirdly, she applied the principle of testamentary autonomy 
  (i.e., the exercise by a testator or testatrix of his or her freedom to dispose 
  of property, which is to be interfered with not lightly, but only in so far 
  as the statute requires).</p>
<p>
  [42] There are three differences of note between the British Columbia and the 
  Ontario legislation. First, subsection 58(1) of the Succession Law Reform Act 
  stipulates that if a deceased &quot;has not made adequate provision for the 
  proper support of his dependants&quot;, the court may &quot;order that such 
  provisions as it considers adequate&quot; be made, whereas subsection 2(1) of 
  the British Columbia statute uses the language of not making &quot;adequate 
  provision for the proper maintenance and support&quot; permitting the court 
  to order what it considers &quot;adequate, just and equitable in the circumstances&quot;. 
  Secondly, the beneficiaries of the British Columbia statute are not limited 
  to dependant spouses and children, whereas that is the case in Ontario. Finally, 
  the British Columbia legislation does not contain the long list of enumerated 
  factors to be taken into account by the court, as found in subsection 62(1) 
  of the Ontario Act.</p>
<p>
  [43] I do not think the difference in phraseology between the two statutes is 
  significant. The language of sections 58(1) and 62 of the Succession Law Reform 
  Act is broad enough itself. It provides the court with a discretion that is 
  to be exercised upon a consideration of all the circumstances of the application. 
  Nor am I persuaded that the disparity in language between &quot;adequate&quot; 
  and &quot;adequate, just and equitable in the circumstances&quot; is important. 
  As I have already noted, an Ontario court is mandated by the opening wording 
  of subsection 62(1) to &quot;consider all the circumstances of the application&quot;. 
  Moreover, as McLachlin J. observed in Tataryn, at para. 13, the making of &quot;adequate&quot; 
  provision and the ordering of what is &quot;adequate, just and equitable&quot; 
  are &quot;two sides of the same coin&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [44] The fact that the British Columbia legislation does not exclude adult independant 
  children was weighed as a factor militating against a &quot;needs only&quot; 
  test by McLachlin J. in Tataryn. However, it was only one factor of many, and 
  was not dispositive. In any event, the definition of &quot;dependant&quot; in 
  the Succession Law Reform Act is broader than that of its predecessor, the Dependants' 
  Relief Act, and Ontario courts readily applied the &quot;moral duty&quot; analysis 
  to applications under the latter legislation: see, for example, Re Hull Estate, 
  supra.</p>
<p> [45] Finally, I do not think the enumerated list of factors the court is required 
  to consider under subsection 62(1) militates against the examination of moral 
  duties. To the contrary, many of the factors outlined invoke such considerations 
  and, as Misener J. noted in Kipp v. Buck Estate, supra,<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  reinforce the notion that moral obligations of the deceased cannot be ignored. 
  I note, for example, the provisions in paragraphs 62(1)(g) [the proximity and 
  duration of the dependant's relationship with the deceased]; (h) [contributions 
  made by the dependant to the deceased's welfare], (i) [contributions by the 
  dependant to the acquisition, maintenance and improvement of the deceased's 
  property and business], (j) [contribution to the deceased's career potential], 
  (k) [legal support obligations by the deceased to other persons], (o) [the claims 
  any other person may have as a dependant], and (r)(ii) [the length of time the 
  spouses cohabited]. Thus, in spite of other listed factors that relate, directly 
  or indirectly, to needs and means, the provisions of subsection 62(1) of the 
  Act are not limited to economic considerations alone. Moral considerations are 
  relevant to the exercise.</p>
<p>
  [46] Moral considerations are not something to be contemplated in addition to, 
  or in isolation from, subsection 62(1), however. The legal obligations and moral 
  obligations referred to in Tataryn are reflected, for the most part, in the 
  language of that lengthy provision. Thus, the principles of Tataryn are to be 
  applied in the context of considering the factors listed and the general direction 
  to consider all the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [47] I conclude, therefore, that the disparities between the British Columbia 
  and Ontario statutes are not sufficiently telling to preclude the application 
  of Tataryn in this province.</p>
<p> [48] There is another reason why the Tataryn approach fits in Ontario as well. 
  The view of dependants' relief legislation as a vehicle to provide not only 
  for the needs of dependants (thus preventing them from becoming a charge on 
  the state) but also to ensure that spouses and children receive a fair share 
  of family wealth, was also important to the Court's analysis in that case. Society's 
  values and expectations change. In earlier times, the prevailing view was that 
  on termination of a marriage the husband was obliged to maintain the wife, and 
  nothing more. At present, however, the provisions of the Divorce Act<a href="#2">[2]</a>,<a name="r2"></a> 
  family property and family support legislation, and the law relating to constructive 
  trusts, all reflect society's expectations that children will be properly supported 
  and that spouses are entitled not only to proper support but also to a share 
  in each other's estate when a marriage is over. These expectations are not confined 
  to British Columbia. They are mirrored in Ontario as well through the provisions 
  of the Divorce Act and the Family Law Act<a href="#3">[3]</a>.<a name="r3"></a></p>
<p>
  [49] As Justice McLachlin remarked in Tataryn, the Act must be interpreted through 
  the prism of modern values. At paragraphs 15 and 28 she said: </p>
<p class="indent"> The language of the Act confers a broad discretion on the court. 
  The generosity of the language suggests that the legislature was attempting 
  to craft a formula which would permit the courts to make orders which are just 
  in the specific circumstances and in light of contemporary standards. This, 
  combined with the rule that a statute is always speaking (Interpretation Act, 
  R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 206, s. 7), means that the Act must be read in light of modern 
  values and expectations. What was thought to be adequate, just and equitable 
  in the 1920's may be quite different from what is considered adequate, just 
  and equitable in the 1990's. (underlining added)</p>
<p class="indent">If the phrase &quot;adequate, just and equitable&quot; is viewed 
  in light of current societal norms, much of the uncertainty [about the lack 
  of clear legal standards by which to judge moral duties] disappears. Furthermore, 
  two sorts of norms are available and both must be addressed. The first are the 
  obligations which the law would impose on a person during his or her life were 
  the question of provision for the claimant to arise. These might be described 
  as legal obligations. The second type of norms are found in society's reasonable 
  expectations of what a judicious person would do in the circumstances, by reference 
  to contemporary community standards. These might be called moral obligations, 
  following the language traditionally used by the courts. Together, these two 
  norms provide a guide to what is &quot;adequate, just and equitable&quot; in 
  the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [50] In short, when examining all of the circumstances of an application for 
  dependants' relief, the court must consider,</p>
<p class="indent">a) what legal obligations would have been imposed on the deceased 
  had the question of provision arisen during his lifetime; and,</p>
<p class="indent"> b) what moral obligations arise between the deceased and his 
  or her dependants as a result of society's expectations of what a judicious 
  person would do in the circumstances. </p>
<p>
  [51] Either or both of these types of obligations fit nicely into the lengthy 
  list of factors already articulated in subsection 62(1), as I have mentioned.</p>
<p>
  [52] Finally, I note - as Cullity J. observed - that Tataryn has been applied 
  in other provinces, such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, and New Brunswick, where 
  the legislation is more similar to Ontario's statute than to the Wills Variation 
  Act in British Columbia. See, for example Siegel v. Siegel Estate, [1995] A.J. 
  No. 1158 (Alta. Q.B.); Gavinchuk v. Mickalyk, [2003] A.J. No. 1279 (Alta. Q.B.); 
  Ostrander v. Kimble Estate, [1996] S.J. No. 444 (Sask. Q.B.); Thronberg v. Thronberg, 
  [2003] S.J. No. 195 (Sask. Q.B.); Currie v. Currie (Estate), [1995] N.B.J. No. 
  305 (N.B.C.A.)</p>
<p>
  [53] The application judge was correct in concluding that moral considerations 
  continue to be relevant to applications under Part V of the Succession Law Reform 
  Act in Ontario. I do not see the need to qualify this principle by suggesting 
  that those considerations may be of &quot;less significance&quot; here than 
  under the British Columbia legislation. In practical terms I do not know how 
  one would apply such a distinction.</p>

<p>
  The Quantum of Dependants' Relief Support Awarded</p>
<p>
  [54] The next question to be determined is whether the application judge reasonably 
  exercised his discretion in applying the foregoing principles, and the provisions 
  of sections 58 and 62, in arriving at his disposition in the circumstances of 
  this case. In my opinion, he did.</p>
<p>
  [55] The appellants argue that the application judge failed to give proper weight 
  to the needs of Paul, in particular, in arriving at his decision. Those needs 
  are large, permanent, and will increase with time. The appellants do not submit 
  that all of Mr. Cummings' assets should have gone to support the children, but 
  contend for a two-thirds/one-third distribution.</p>
<p>
  [56] The application judge was exercising a discretion, however. In the absence 
  of an error in principle, a failure to consider material evidence, or the giving 
  of too much weight to one relevant consideration over others, this Court will 
  not interfere with the exercise of that discretion.</p>
<p>
  [57] Here, the application judge considered at length the evidence concerning 
  the needs and means of Paul and Elizabeth, the size of the testamentary and 
  notional estates, the meaning of &quot;proper&quot; support, and the legal and 
  moral claims of the children as well as those of Mary Cummings and Ruta Cummings 
  to support. He recognized that the determination of proper support for Paul 
  was a matter of considerable difficulty and, indeed, that it was not possible 
  to provide adequate support for him, given the limited size of the estate. He 
  properly concluded that Mr. Cummings had recognized his obligations to his children 
  by setting up the $125,000 testamentary trust, but that the trust nonetheless 
  did not provide adequate provision for the proper support of his son. While 
  he did not find the establishment of the trust was necessarily inadequate for 
  the proper support of Elizabeth, he concluded that the provisions made for her 
  should be respected in the order he made.</p>
<p>
  [58] In short, the application judge - as he properly should have done - gave 
  consideration to the effect of his order on all dependants. If all, or substantially 
  more of Mr. Cummings' estate had been allocated to or charged with the support 
  of Paul, the respondent Ruta Cummings would arguably be in need. The application 
  judge found that &quot;the moral claims of the Respondent arising from the financial, 
  and other, contributions to their relationship during her period of cohabitation 
  with the deceased should be recognized to the extent that her beneficial ownership 
  of the matrimonial home should not be disturbed, or substantially encumbered, 
  by the order [to be made] for the support of Paul and Elizabeth&quot;. He therefore 
  interfered with Mr. Cummings' testamentary autonomy to the extent of replacing 
  the $125,000 testamentary trust with a lump sum payment of $250,000 to Mary 
  Cummings, to be held in trust to be applied to the extent of $10,000 for Elizabeth's 
  expenses of completing her education and the balance to be applied for the care 
  and welfare of Paul Cummings during his life. This order was justified in law 
  and on the record, in my opinion. </p>
<p>
  [59] The matrimonial home had a net equity of about $422,500. The RRSP's had 
  a value of $375,000 (subject to unspecified amounts of tax, if distributed). 
  The total net value of the estate, for dependants' relief purposes was approximately 
  $650,000. In effect, what the application judge did was to deduct the equivalent 
  of one-half the value of the matrimonial home ($211,250) and distribute or charge 
  the balance ($438,750) on roughly a 57%/43% basis in favour of the children. 
  This is consistent with the approach in Tataryn, both because of Mr. Cummings' 
  legal obligations respecting the respondent regarding the equalization of net 
  family properties on death and because of the respondent's moral claims arising 
  from financial and other contributions that she had made to the relationship 
  over its 12-year duration. While another judge may have concluded that a higher 
  proportion of the net estate should have been allocated to Paul's care, I can 
  find no error in the exercise by the application judge of his discretion in 
  this regard.</p>
<p>
  [60] I would not interfere with the exercise of that discretion in the circumstances 
  of this case.</p>
<p>The Costs Order </p>
<p>
  [61] The appellants also seek leave to appeal, and if leave be granted, to appeal 
  from the order of the application judge that there should be no costs of the 
  application.</p>
<p>
  [62] In practice, where the Court has concluded that the deceased's distribution 
  should be reviewed in favour of a dependant, costs of all parties are generally 
  ordered to be paid out of the estate on a substantial indemnity basis: MacDonnell, 
  Sheard, and Hull, Probate Practice, 4th ed., at p. 149. However, the Court has 
  the power under section 75 of the Act to &quot;direct that the costs of the 
  application be paid out of the estate or otherwise as it thinks proper&quot;. 
  Here, the application judge exercised his discretion to order otherwise.</p>
<p>
  [63] In doing so, he considered and weighed a number of relevant factors, including,</p>
<p class="indent">a) the measure of success enjoyed by the applicants;</p>
<p class="indent">b) a more favourable offer to settle that had been made by the 
  respondent;</p>
<p class="indent"> c) certain conduct on the part of the respondent that had protracted 
  the proceedings;</p>
<p class="indent"> d) the difficulties of the case;</p>
<p class="indent"> e) the size of the estate and the impact of a cost award on 
  the respondent; and,</p>
<p class="indent">f) the bills of costs provided by the parties.</p>
<p>
  [64] The application judge recognized that &quot;the task of weighing these 
  considerations was not an easy one&quot;, but in the end concluded that the 
  appropriate exercise of his discretion in the circumstances was for the parties 
  to bear their own costs. I see no error on his part in doing so.</p>
<p>
  [65] I would therefore grant leave to appeal from the order as to costs but 
  dismiss the appeal in that regard.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [66] For the foregoing reasons I would dismiss the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [67] Counsel for the respondent did not seek costs if the appeal were dismissed. 
  There will therefore be no costs of the appeal.</p>
