<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice John G. O'Driscoll of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on April 19, 2001.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, William Kevin Curran, was tried by Justice John O'Driscoll, 
  sitting with a jury, on a single count of first degree murder. The indictment 
  alleged that on November 23, 1998 the appellant murdered James Myers. On April 
  19, 2001, after a trial lasting almost three months, the jury returned a verdict 
  of guilty. The appellant was sentenced to the mandatory term of life imprisonment 
  without parole for 25 years.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant appeals the conviction on several grounds. Most of the grounds 
  relate to the trial judge's charge to the jury. In addition, there are two grounds 
  of appeal relating to evidentiary rulings made by the trial judge during the 
  trial.</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  [3] The deceased, James Myers, lived with his 16 year old son, Ashton, at 75 
  Meadowvale Avenue in Mississauga. The appellant and the deceased had known each 
  other for several years prior to November 23, 1998. The appellant had visited 
  the home on many occasions.</p>
<p>
  [4] On November 23, 1998, an intruder or intruders came to the Myers home around 
  7:15 p.m. Myers was shot dead and his body was set on fire inside the house. 
  The Crown's case against the appellant rested on two foundations, the identification 
  evidence of Ashton Myers and the evidence of an alleged motive.</p>
<p>
  [5] Ashton testified that on the evening of the murder he and his father were 
  at home watching television. There was sudden and loud noise and a person or 
  persons tried to break into the home. Ashton and his father attempted to flee 
  (even though the father kept several loaded guns in the house). The father was 
  shot once in the chest. Ashton escaped towards a nearby ravine. He testified 
  that from this vantage point he observed the appellant set the house ablaze 
  and run down a street near the ravine with another man.</p>
<p>
  [6] The Crown contended that the motive for the crime was retribution by the 
  appellant because the deceased had short-changed him with respect to the proceeds 
  from a jewellery store break and enter which they had jointly conducted in the 
  summer of 1998. In support of this theory, Ashton testified about an incident 
  several months prior to November 23, which he called the &quot;Mexican stand-off&quot;. 
  The appellant came to 75 Meadowvale Avenue to retrieve his portion of the jewellery 
  store caper. There was a heated argument between the appellant and the deceased, 
  with each drawing a gun. The appellant left with some jewellery but, according 
  to Ashton, as the appellant drove off, he pointed a gun at the deceased and 
  said &quot;I'll be back&quot;. The Crown theory was that the appellant was true 
  to his word and returned on November 23 to exact his revenge.</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant did not testify. The defence relied on evidence from the deceased's 
  neighbours, Kent and Geraldine Dickson, who witnessed the Mexican stand-off 
  and some of the events on November 23. In particular, the defence pointed to 
  Kent Dickson's evidence that the appellant was not the man at the stand-off 
  to undercut the Crown position on motive.</p>
<p>
  [8] The defence also contended that Ashton's identification of the appellant 
  as the person at the stand-off and on November 23 was so fraught with frailties 
  and contradictions as to be completely worthless. Indeed, the defence went so 
  far as to submit to the jury that Ashton was lying about being present in the 
  house on the evening of November 23 when his father was killed. The defence 
  suggested that Ashton was scared of the real killer or killers and, by testifying 
  against the appellant, was trying to send a message that they had nothing to 
  fear from him.</p>
<p>
  [9] The defence called evidence from Scott Walters, a forensic engineer, who 
  made a reconstruction video of the area between the house and the ravine where 
  Ashton said he was hiding and saw the appellant. The video, its contextual measurements 
  and light readings, and Walters' testimony were designed to show that it would 
  have been extremely difficult for Ashton to see and identify the appellant on 
  the night in question.</p>
<p>
  [10] After hearing thirty-five witnesses, the jury deliberated for about a day 
  and a half before finding the appellant guilty of first degree murder. The appellant 
  now seeks a new trial based on alleged improper evidentiary rulings and errors 
  in the charge to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [11] There are other facts relevant to the disposition of the appeal. I find 
  it convenient to introduce those facts in the context of the legal issues to 
  which they specifically relate.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [12] The appellant raises issues relating to the admission and non-admission 
  of evidence and various aspects of the trial judge's charge to the jury. I would 
  frame the issues as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Evidentiary issues</p>
<p class="indent">(1) Did the trial judge err by refusing to permit the appellant 
  to conduct a courtroom demonstration regarding his voice and his speech impediment?</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Did the trial judge err by admitting evidence of the appellant's 
  post-offence conduct?</p>
<p class="indent">Jury charge issues</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Did the trial judge adequately caution the jury about evidence 
  relating to the appellant's post-offence conduct?</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Did the trial judge adequately caution the jury about Ashton 
  Myers' identification evidence and, in particular, the factors that could undermine 
  that evidence?</p>
<p class="indent">(5) Did the trial judge err by failing to give a limiting charge 
  about evidence that incidentally demonstrated the bad character of the appellant?</p>
<p class="indent">(6) Did the trial judge err by failing to instruct the jury 
  in accordance with R. v. W.(D.)?</p>
<p class="indent">(7) Did the trial judge adequately explain to the jury the defence 
  theory and the evidence in support of it?</p>
<p class="indent">(8) Did the trial judge err by expressing his opinion in stronger 
  terms than the evidence permitted and thereby deprive the appellant of a fair 
  presentation of his case to the jury?</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  Evidentiary issues</p>
<p>
  (1) Courtroom demonstration</p>
<p>
  [13] Kent Dickson was called as a Crown witness. He lived next door to the deceased. 
  He witnessed the stand-off incident in the summer of 1998. He testified that 
  the appellant was not the man involved in the stand-off.</p>
<p>
  [14] Dickson also testified that he heard the man make several statements during 
  the argument with the deceased. During cross-examination, defence counsel sought 
  permission to have the appellant say those words in open court, with a view 
  to eliciting from Dickson his opinion as to whether the appellant's voice was 
  the same as that of the man involved in the stand-off several years before. 
  The trial judge refused to permit this audio re-enactment.</p>
<p>
  [15] The question of courtroom demonstrations is one that is largely subject 
  to the discretion of the trial judge: see R. v. Howard and Trudel (1983), 3 
  C.C.C. (3d) 399 at 416 (Ont. C.A.). I cannot say that the trial judge improperly 
  exercised his discretion in refusing to allow an audio re-enactment almost three 
  years after the event in question.</p>
<p>
  (2) Post-offence conduct</p>
<p>
  [16] The deceased was killed on November 23, 1998. Because of what Ashton Myers 
  told the police, the appellant almost immediately became a suspect. The police 
  conducted surveillance of him. On November 25, Constable Robert Culkin followed 
  the appellant to a bank of telephones in a shopping mall. The officer stood 
  next to the appellant and overheard his side of the conversation. The Crown 
  sought to elicit the officer's testimony about the conversation under the rubric 
  of relevant post-offence conduct.</p>
<p>
  [17] The trial judge summarized the gist of the appellant's overheard words 
  in his ruling: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The accused was talking about appraisals, house prices; that he was going on 
  Friday, Saturday or Sunday; that he was worrying about it and he was taking 
  medication; he said he had a real argument with him, he was trying not to worry 
  about it, that he will call. He was talking about prices of 115 to $150,000. 
  Apparently, the officer heard the accused use the name &quot;Pat&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [18] The trial judge ruled that the officer could testify about the overheard 
  conversation. He said: </p>
<p class="indent"> The proposed evidence here does not show or imply that the 
  accused is committing any criminal offence. It is post-offence conduct that 
  may amount to circumstantial evidence of the accused's involvement in the November 
  23, 1998 homicide. The arguments put to me about admissibility were ill-founded. 
  What was being argued, in fact, was weight. That is a matter for the jury to 
  decide.</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, the proposed evidence is relevant to the only issue 
  in this case - identity.</p>
<p>
  [19] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in making this ruling. 
  He submits that, much like in R. v. Ferris, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 756, where the overheard 
  statement &quot;I killed David&quot; was excluded because of an absence of context, 
  the overheard conversation here should also have been excluded because Constable 
  Culkin heard only one side of it.</p>
<p>
  [20] I disagree. The conversation overheard by Constable Culkin was much more 
  detailed than the conversation in Ferris. Accordingly, it was open to the trial 
  judge to admit evidence concerning the conversation and leave it to the jury 
  to assess its weight. As expressed by Major J. in R. v. White (1998), 125 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 385 at 400-01 (S.C.C.): </p>
<p class="indent">
  As a general rule, it will be for the jury to decide, on the basis of the evidence 
  as a whole, whether the post-offence conduct of the accused is related to the 
  crime before them rather than to some other culpable act. It is also within 
  the province of the jury to consider how much weight, if any, such evidence 
  should be accorded in the final determination of guilt or innocence. For the 
  trial judge to interfere in that process will in most cases constitute a usurpation 
  of the jury's fact-finding role.</p>
<p>
  Jury charge issues</p>
<p>
  (3) Post-offence conduct</p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct 
  the jury that the evidence of post-offence conduct could be used to support 
  an inference of guilt only if the jury rejected any innocent explanation for 
  the conduct: see R. v. Diu (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 520 (Ont. C.A.)</p>
<p>
  [22] Defence counsel objected to the trial judge's initial charge on this issue. 
  The Crown supported the objection. The trial judge made an extensive recharge. 
  There is nothing critical of the recharge in the appellant's factum, and in 
  oral argument counsel conceded that the trial judge did place the 'possible 
  innocent explanations for the conduct' aspect of the post-offence conduct analysis 
  before the jury, specifically when he instructed: </p>
<p class="indent"> Crown counsel asks you to consider as post-offence conduct 
  the telephone conversation and the conversation with Mr. Porter with regard 
  to the garbage, and the moving of the garbage from place to place, and asking 
  Mr. Porter about whether or not someone had collected the garbage. All of that, 
  you heard it, and I am not going to repeat it.</p>
<p class="indent">Does it have any significance, or is it just a man who was about 
  to move away from the jurisdiction who doesn't have any garbage cans and wants 
  to be tidy? The fact that the house is vacant when the police get there, does 
  that have any significance, or is it simply a man who has made prior arrangements 
  to move to the east coast because his wife had cancer and was dying, according 
  to the evidence?</p>
<p class="indent">Evidence of alleged post-offence conduct should not be considered 
  in isolation. It should be considered with all the other evidence in deciding 
  whether Mr. Curran's guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="indent">In this respect, it does not differ from other items of circumstantial 
  evidence.</p>
<p>
  In my view, this recharge complies with Diu and the other authorities relating 
  to post-offence conduct.</p>
<p>
  (4) Identification evidence</p>
<p>
  [23] The issue of identification, and in particular Ashton Myers' identification 
  of the appellant, was at the heart of the trial. The trial judge's charge to 
  the jury on this issue is a principal ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant concedes that the trial judge gave an appropriate general 
  caution about the frailties of identification evidence and mentioned some of 
  the factors the jury should consider when assessing the weight of the identification. 
  However, the appellant contends that the trial judge erred in his charge to 
  the jury concerning the identification evidence of Ashton Myers in three respects: 
  (1) by failing to caution the jury that it must be careful before convicting 
  because honest and convincing witnesses can be wrong even in cases of recognition; 
  (2) by failing to adequately outline to the jury the factors that weakened Ashton 
  Myers' identification of the appellant; and (3) by leaving with the jury evidence 
  of a photo line-up as supportive of Ashton Myers' identification of the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [25] With respect to the first submission, the starting point is that Ashton 
  Myers knew the appellant who had been to the Myers home many times, especially 
  in the year preceding the events of November 23, 1998. Accordingly, Ashton's 
  identification of the appellant was arguably a recognition of a person he knew, 
  not an identification of a person he had never seen before the night in question.</p>
<p>
  [26] The appellant contends, correctly, that a jury must be warned of the frailties 
  of eyewitness identification even in cases of recognition: see R. v. Miller 
  (1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 141 at 150-51 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [27] The trial judge gave the standard strong warning about the frailties of 
  identification evidence. He then listed, and provided commentary about, the 
  standard factors relevant to an identification case. With respect to the first 
  factor - the circumstances in which the witness made his observation - he said: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Did the witness know the person before he saw him or her 
  at that time?</p>
<p class="indent">Crown counsel submits that this is not really a case of &quot;identification&quot; 
  but it is one of &quot;recognition&quot;, because Ashton Myers had known Kevin 
  for several years before the night of the murder. Kevin Curran had visited 75 
  Meadowvale Drive some twenty to thirty times in the previous eleven months.</p>
<p>
  [28] The appellant contends that this instruction would have left the jury with 
  the impression that there was an important difference between 'recognition' 
  and 'identification' and that the strong caution he had just given about the 
  frailties of identification evidence did not apply in this, a recognition, case.</p>
<p>
  [29] I disagree. The trial judge provided the jury with the standard jury instruction 
  on the assessment of identification evidence. After cautioning the jury about 
  reliance on eyewitness testimony because of the risk of miscarriages of justice 
  and the fact that honest and convincing witnesses can be mistaken, the trial 
  judge directed the jury to consider a number of factors, the first being whether 
  Ashton knew the person he claimed to have seen on November 23, 1998. With respect 
  to this factor, the trial judge stated that it was the Crown position that this 
  was a case of 'recognition' rather than 'identification' because Ashton had 
  known the appellant for several years. This was an accurate comment. The trial 
  judge said nothing more and continued to instruct the jury on the remaining 
  factors to consider in its assessment of the identification evidence. There 
  is nothing in the trial judge's instruction on the first factor, or in the subsequent 
  portion of the charge relating to identification, that would have left the jury 
  with the impression that it should disregard the complete instruction on the 
  assessment of identification evidence.</p>
<p>
  [30] With respect to the appellant's second submission on the identification 
  issue - namely that the trial judge failed to adequately outline the factors 
  which weakened Ashton's identification of the appellant (see R. v. Olbey (1971), 
  4 C.C.C. (2d) 103 at 114 (Ont. C.A.)) - the trial judge provided the jury with 
  all of the factors (set out as questions) in the standard jury charge relating 
  to the assessment of identification evidence. He also provided specific information 
  relating to some of those questions, for example: </p>
<p class="indent"> How good or bad was the visibility?</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Walters [the defence expert] said on November 23, 1998, 
  if I have his evidence correctly, there was a quarter moon in the sky.</p>
<p>
  [31] It is true that the trial judge did not provide specific information in 
  relation to some of the other factors. However, it is important to place this 
  alleged error in context. Just before turning to the standard jury charge on 
  identification evidence, the trial judge had canvassed the evidence of Ashton 
  Myers and Scott Walters, the defence expert called to challenge Ashton's identification. 
  In this review, a good portion of the evidence relating to many of the relevant 
  factors was placed before the jury. It is highly unlikely that the jury would 
  have failed to connect the trial judge's review of the Crown and defence evidence 
  relating to identification with the questions the judge posed for the jury to 
  consider immediately after that review. Further, viewed in the context of the 
  closing addresses of counsel, and the evidence that was capable of supporting 
  Ashton's observations, the trial judge's failure to review all of the evidence 
  relevant to Ashton's identification is not a fatal flaw.</p>
<p>
  [32] The appellant contends that, although the trial judge reviewed the evidence 
  relating to identification of the defence witness Scott Walters, he said nothing 
  about the identification evidence of the Crown witness Kent Dickson who testified, 
  in direct contradiction to Ashton Myers, that the appellant was not the man 
  involved in the stand-off with James Myers in the summer of 1998. Defence counsel 
  objected to this omission. Crown counsel agreed with this objection.</p>
<p>
  [33] The trial judge did review some of Kent Dickson's testimony in his initial 
  charge. However, he did not mention the direct conflict between Dickson and 
  Ashton with respect to the identity of the man in the stand-off. I agree with 
  the appellant that the omission of such a reference on a point crucial to the 
  defence was an error, one which I would label serious. However, it is important 
  to examine what happened after this omission.</p>
<p>
  [34] When the trial judge completed his comprehensive jury charge (three hours 
  and 40 minutes, 205 pages) it was 5:14 p.m. The jury retired to consider its 
  verdict, there was a 30 minute recess, and counsel made their submissions about 
  the jury charge. The submissions concluded at 8:00 p.m. The court adjourned 
  for the day.</p>
<p>
  [35] When court reconvened the next morning, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The jury was back deliberating this morning and I was preparing to come in, 
  getting ready to recall the jury, and I now received the first question from 
  the jury.</p>
<p>
  [36] The jury question asked for testimony to be read back in four domains, 
  including: </p>
<p class="indent"> 2. Evidence in-chief and cross-examination of Mr. and Mrs. 
  Dickson re description of the man in the stand-off.</p>
<p class="indent">3. Evidence in-chief and cross-examination of Ashton Myers re 
  description of Kevin on the porch of 75 Meadowvale, tossing something in the 
  door.</p>
<p>
  It is clear from this question that the jury was focused on the identification 
  issue.</p>
<p>
  [37] The trial judge, counsel and the court reporter worked together for almost 
  four hours to identify the relevant portions of the testimony and to prepare 
  them for a read-back. Just before he recalled the jury, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Some of the matters that I was going to instruct them and some of the things 
  I was going to read to them I can eliminate as a result of the questions they 
  asked.</p>
<p>
  Defence counsel submitted: &quot;If you are going to recharge them &#133; you 
  ought to recharge them in full, notwithstanding any questions they have asked.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [38] The jury was recalled and the testimony of Kent Dickson on the issue of 
  identification was read back in its entirety - examination-in-chief and cross-examination.</p>
<p>
  [39] Following the completion of the response to the jury's question, the trial 
  judge recharged the jury on certain matters, including post-offence conduct, 
  reasonable doubt and parties to an offence. It is also clear that he had intended 
  to correct his omission of any reference to Kent Dickson's identification testimony 
  because in his recharge he said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [A]fter you retired yesterday, I heard submissions from counsel, and overnight 
  I thought I was going to bring you back this morning, and then I got question 
  number 1 and it entailed read backs of some of the matters that I was going 
  to read back to you myself this morning with regards to Mr. Dickson, and I have 
  checked what has been read to you today and it covered all that I was going 
  to read back to you, so that part of my recharge has been done by way of answering 
  the question.</p>
<p>
  Although defence counsel then objected to the trial judge's recharge relating 
  to post-offence conduct, he did not object to the recharge relating to Kent 
  Dickson's evidence.</p>
<p>
  [40] On appeal, the appellant contends that the trial judge's treatment of Dickson's 
  evidence was unfair, and that he should have juxtaposed it more directly with 
  Ashton Myers' testimony about the identity of the person involved in the summer 
  stand-off.</p>
<p>
  [41] I disagree. It is clear from the jury's question that the issue of identity 
  was front and centre in its deliberations. The jury knew that Ashton identified 
  the appellant as the participant in the stand-off. Moreover, the jury had just 
  heard in the read-back Kent Dickson's testimony that the appellant was not the 
  man involved in the stand-off. In these circumstances, further comment by the 
  trial judge would have been superfluous.</p>
<p>
  [42] The appellant's third submission on the identification issue is that the 
  trial judge erred when, under the rubric &quot;The circumstances of the witness 
  identification of William Kevin Curran as the person [Ashton] saw&quot;, he 
  said: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. How long was it between the observation and the identification?</p>
<p class="indent">You will recall that Ashton Myers went to 22 Division later 
  that evening (November 23, 1998) and identified the person as &quot;Kevin&quot;, 
  who lived in Barrie and drove a Jeep.</p>
<p class="indent">2. Did anyone show photographs to Ashton Myers?</p>
<p class="indent">You recall I read to you earlier a part of the transcript where 
  he was shown photographs by Detective Mark Mendelson of the Toronto Homicide 
  Squad. The twelve (12) pictures are before you as Exhibit 113. He picked out 
  number 4 and signed the back of it. There was no cross-examination of Detective 
  Mark Mendelson.</p>
<p>
  [43] The appellant contends that this comment by the trial judge constitutes 
  an error because evidence of a subsequent identification of a person in a photo 
  line-up is not capable of confirming a prior identification: see R. v. Spatola, 
  [1970] 3 O.R. 74 at 84 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [44] I disagree. I do not read this passage as establishing that the trial judge 
  emphasized, or even implied, that the jury could use the photo line-up to bolster 
  Ashton's evidence. Rather the question and answer relating to the photo line-up 
  serve as part of the background or narrative relating to Ashton's identification 
  of the appellant. The overwhelming thrust and weight of Ashton's identification 
  evidence related to his observations on the night of the murder and, to a lesser 
  extent, his observations about the summer stand-off.</p>
<p>
  (5) Bad Character</p>
<p>
  [45] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred by failing to give the 
  jury a limiting instruction regarding the evidence of the appellant's involvement 
  in the jewellery store break-in, his relationship with the deceased (who, according 
  to his son's testimony, was a career criminal), and the Mexican stand-off (which 
  involved guns). The appellant submits that this evidence had a potentially prejudicial 
  effect as it painted the appellant as a criminal and impugned his character.</p>
<p>
  [46] Defence counsel sought a limiting instruction. The Crown did not oppose 
  such an instruction, provided it was coupled with an instruction about the permissible 
  uses of the evidence, especially as corroborative of Ashton's evidence about 
  motive. The trial judge decided not to give such an instruction, probably because, 
  as he stated during an exchange with defence counsel: &quot;If it is bad character 
  evidence, in my view, all I would be doing is underlining it, if I did; if it 
  is; and I don't think it is.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [47] In my view, the trial judge did not err in exercising his discretion against 
  giving a limiting instruction in this domain. Indeed, his ruling came comfortably 
  within the decision of this court in R. v. Merz (1999), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 259 
  at 278, wherein Doherty J.A. said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I agree with the view expressed in Jackson. The evidence of the threats made 
  by the appellant was evidence of motive which, in turn, constituted circumstantial 
  evidence of identity and intent. I see no reason to warn the jury against using 
  the evidence to infer propensity and hence to infer that the accused committed 
  the crime when the more direct and powerful inference to be drawn from that 
  evidence is that the accused had a motive to kill Ms. Murray. The trial judge 
  properly instructed the jury as to how they could use evidence of motive. The 
  limiting instruction normally given when evidence of prior bad acts by the accused 
  is placed before the jury would make no sense in the context of evidence of 
  motive. An instruction like that called for by the appellant could only serve 
  to confuse the jury.</p>
<p>
  [48] As in Merz, the evidence in the present case that might suggest that the 
  appellant was a person of bad character was also directly and powerfully related 
  to motive. This was especially true of the evidence relating to the jewellery 
  store break-in and the stand-off incident. Moreover, as in Merz, the trial judge 
  gave a proper instruction on motive.</p>
<p>
  (6) Reasonable doubt: W.(D.)</p>
<p>
  [49] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred by not providing a W.(D). 
  instruction: see R. v. W.(D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 at 409 (S.C.C.). He 
  submits that the evidence of Kent Dickson, Geraldine Dickson, Lynne Koverko 
  (Crown witnesses) and Scott Walters (a defence witness) was capable of raising 
  a reasonable doubt which the jury could act on even if it did not believe their 
  evidence; hence the need for a W.(D.) instruction.</p>
<p>
  [50] I do not agree. The fundamental question is always whether the jury was 
  properly instructed in relation to the burden and standard of proof and related 
  issues like credibility. In my view, the trial judge's instructions on these 
  crucial issues were comprehensive and accurate. They complied with the requirements 
  set out in a long line of post-W.(D.) decisions: see R. v. Campbell (1995), 
  24 O.R. (3d) 537 (C.A.), R. v. Harriott (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), aff'd 
  [2003] 1 S.C.R. 39; R. v. Brown (2002), 169 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.); and 
  R. v. Do (2003), 175 C.C.C. (3d) 176 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  (7) The defence theory</p>
<p>
  [51] The appellant contends that the trial judge so completely failed to put 
  the defence theory and evidence in support of it to the jury that it rendered 
  the trial unfair.</p>
<p>
  [52] I disagree. Near the end of his charge, the trial judge set out the defence 
  and Crown theories - the former in 13 propositions covering six pages, the latter 
  in 15 propositions covering three pages.</p>
<p>
  [53] Importantly, the trial judge's summary of the defence theory was a very 
  faithful rendering of defence counsel's closing address; indeed the 13 propositions 
  set out by the trial judge were all argued by defence counsel, and in virtually 
  the same order as the trial judge's later coverage of them in his jury charge.</p>
<p>
  [54] Nor is it fair to say that the trial judge did not adequately deal with 
  the evidence in support of the defence theory. The two main components of the 
  defence case were Scott Walters' expert evidence and the contention, flowing 
  from a vigorous cross-examination, that Ashton Myers was lying. The trial judge 
  dealt with both of these matters in considerable detail. Indeed, with respect 
  to the second point, the trial judge covered it more extensively than any other 
  point in his summary of the defence theory. He dealt with it in four of the 
  13 propositions he set out, and included fairly extensive portions of defence 
  counsel's cross-examination of Ashton to emphasize the defence position on the 
  fabrication assertion: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. He said that Ashton Myers is neither reliable nor credible.</p>

<p class="indent"> &quot;QUESTION: Again, that's another reason, I put it to you, 
  you weren't there at this time when your father was shot in the house at 75

  death of your father looked like an organized crime matter?</p>
<p class="indent">ANSWER: I said that it was organized.</p>
<p class="indent">QUESTION: Hm-hmm. And you agree that you shouldn't have survived, 
  if, indeed, you came out of the house first?</p>
<p class="indent">ANSWER: I should not.</p>
<p class="indent">QUESTION: And you said it was just incompetence on their part?</p>
<p class="indent">ANSWER: Correct.</p>
<p class="indent">QUESTION: You must have thought that whoever killed your father 
  may wish to have harmed you as well?</p>
<p class="indent">ANSWER: Yes.</p>
<p class="indent">QUESTION: And you can send these people, whoever they are, or 
  that person, whoever he is or she is, a clear message, by saying that Kevin 
  Curran is the one who killed your father. You can send them a clear message

  you know about those persons?</p>
<p class="indent">ANSWER: That's a confusing question.</p>
<p class="indent">QUESTION: Okay. Let me try it again.</p>
<p class="indent">You agree that you should rightfully fear for your own safety

<p class="indent">QUESTION: Because of what you knew about your father, and who

  your knowledge of your father, you lived with him for two and a half years?</p>
<p class="indent">ANSWER: Yes.</p>

<p class="indent">12. Mr. Hicks submits that Mr. Ashton Myers could not see and 
  did not see what he has sworn to at this trial.</p>
<p>
  [55] I do not say that the trial judge's charge was perfect. For example, the 
  omission in his initial charge of any reference to Kent Dickson's identification 
  evidence, which conflicted with Ashton Myer's evidence, was a serious defect 
  in the charge. However, as explained in the previous section, this defect was 
  cured by a subsequent read-back of all of Dickson's identification evidence 
  in response to a question from the jury.</p>
<p>
  [56] In summary, the law in this area is clear. As expressed by Cory J. in R. 
  v. G. (R.M.) (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 26 at 32 (S.C.C.): </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the course of giving directions to a jury, it is essential that the trial 
  judge outline for them the theory or position of the defence and refer the jury 
  to the essential elements bearing on that defence in such a way that it will 
  ensure the jury's proper appreciation of the evidence.</p>
<p>
  In my view, the trial judge's charge to the jury, supplemented by the recharge 
  and read-back, complied with this mandate.</p>
<p>
  (8) Judge's opinion</p>
<p>
  [57] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in expressing his opinion 
  when he told the jury that the defence theory that Exhibit 79 (the jewellery 
  tag found in the appellant's back yard) was planted by the police was &quot;without 
  foundation&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [58] I disagree. A trial judge is entitled to comment on the evidence, although 
  he must be careful not to express an opinion far stronger than the facts warrant, 
  or to express his opinion so strongly as to give rise to a likelihood that the 
  jury would be overawed by it: see R. v. Garofoli (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 
  133 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [59] The trial judge's comment about the jewellery tag evidence did not cross 
  these lines. Both at the start and at the conclusion of his charge, the trial 
  judge instructed the jury that it was the sole judge of the facts and could 
  disregard any of his comments, views, opinions or apparent views or opinions. 
  Moreover, he emphasized this point when he made the &quot;without foundation&quot; 
  comment. Immediately before making the comment, he told the jury: &quot;Of course, 
  it is open to you to find that Detective Johnson 'planted' the tag. I agree, 
  it is interesting &#133;. You are the sole judges of the evidence, of the facts, 
  so it is for you to say.&quot; In addition, the appellant concedes that the 
  defence never explicitly put it to Officer Johnson that he planted the tag; 
  nor did defence counsel use language stronger than &quot;interesting&quot; in 
  his discussion of this evidence in his closing address. Finally, the jury asked 
  several questions, most of which focused on the issue of identification. There 
  were no questions about the jewellery tag evidence.</p>
<p>
  [60] For these reasons, the trial judge's comment was not stronger than the 
  evidence suggested, nor was there any risk that it would overawe the jury.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [61] I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
