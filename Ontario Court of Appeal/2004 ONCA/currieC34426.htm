<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of second degree murder. 
  The Crown alleged that the appellant and Colin Lake murdered Louis Ambas in 
  the course of a robbery. The murder was a particularly brutal one. Mr. Ambas 
  was stabbed fifty three times. It was the theory of the Crown that Mr. Lake 
  stabbed Mr. Ambas and that the appellant either participated in the actual stabbing 
  or aided and abetted Lake in the commission of the murder. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant did not testify at trial but, through counsel, took the position 
  that he was present when the murder occurred but did not take part in it. It 
  was the appellant's position that he and Lake had agreed to rob the deceased, 
  but that he had no knowledge that Lake would kill the deceased. </p>
<p>
  The Grounds of Appeal</p>
<p>
  A. Did the trial judge err in refusing to prohibit cross-examination of the 
  appellant on his testimony at Lake's trial?</p>
<p>
  [3] Lake was arrested about fourteen months before the appellant and the two 
  were tried separately. The Crown subpoenaed the appellant to testify at Lake's 
  trial. In the course of his testimony, the Crown was permitted to cross-examine 
  the appellant as an adverse witness. The appellant testified that he was not 
  at the scene of the crime. The Crown cross-examined the appellant in some detail 
  concerning many of these specific pieces of evidence relied on by the Crown 
  to incriminate the appellant. </p>
<p>
  [4] Prior to any evidence being called at the appellant's trial, his counsel 
  asked the trial judge to rule that if the appellant testified, the Crown would 
  not be permitted to cross-examine the appellant on his testimony given at Lake's 
  trial. The defence relied on s. 7 of the Charter and contended that the appellant 
  had been forced to testify and that it would contravene his right against self-incrimination 
  were he faced with his prior testimony. The defence did not indicate what the 
  appellant's evidence would be at his own trial if he testified. </p>
<p>
  [5] The trial judge ruled that if the appellant testified, the Crown could cross-examine 
  him on his prior testimony only to the extent that such cross-examination did 
  not contravene s. 13 of the Charter. He refused to order a blanket prohibition 
  against cross-examination. The trial judge did rule, however, that any attempt 
  to cross-examine the appellant on any part of his prior evidence would be vetted 
  by him in the absence of the jury before he ruled on whether that particular 
  cross-examination could proceed. </p>
<p>
  [6] In oral argument counsel conceded that the trial judge could not, on a motion 
  brought prior to trial, without knowing the substance of the appellant's evidence, 
  make an order totally foreclosing cross-examination by the Crown of the appellant 
  on his prior testimony. We agree with that concession and, in our view, it dooms 
  this ground of appeal. The trial judge could do no more than indicate that the 
  Crown's right to cross-examine would be determined according to the governing 
  authorities and that given the sensitivity of the issues, he would require a 
  vetting of the evidence before making his ruling. The procedure outlined by 
  the trial judge accorded with established jurisprudence under s. 13 of the Charter 
  and protected the rights of the accused. </p>
<p>
  The Testimony of Dr. Klassen</p>
<p>
  [7] Dr. Klassen, a psychiatrist, was called by the defence at trial. He had 
  examined both the appellant and Mr. Lake. He testified that both had a predisposition 
  to violence although Lake's was much stronger and included a marked sadistic 
  dimension. Lake was one of the most dangerous people Dr. Klassen had ever examined. 
  The defence offered this evidence to support its position that given Lake's 
  violent disposition and sadistic inclination, it was much more likely that Lake 
  and not Currie had stabbed the deceased and that it was likely that Lake had 
  acted in a violent outburst that was unplanned. </p>
<p>
  [8] The defence conceded that evidence of Lake's predisposition to violence 
  opened the door to psychiatric evidence of the appellant's predisposition to 
  violence. The defence contended, however, that the Crown should not be allowed 
  to ask the psychiatrist about the basis of his opinion as regards the appellant's 
  predisposition if that basis revealed prior misconduct by the appellant. We 
  reject this submission. The defence opened the door to psychiatric opinion evidence 
  concerning the appellant's disposition for violence. The jury could only assess 
  that opinion evidence if it was provided with a factual basis for that opinion. 
  Moreover, the defence used the evidence of Dr. Klassen to support the position 
  that Lake was much more inclined to violence than the appellant. The jury was 
  provided with the factual basis for the psychiatrist's opinion concerning Lake's 
  disposition for violence. The jury could only engage in the comparative process 
  underlying the defence's assertion if it also had the basis for the psychiatrist's 
  opinion concerning the appellant. </p>
<p>
  [9] We should not be taken as holding that any and all information upon which 
  the psychiatrist relied in forming his opinion with respect to the appellant's 
  propensity for violence was automatically admissible. Like all evidence it could 
  be excluded if its prejudicial effect exceeded its probative value. The defence 
  at trial did not ask the trial judge to exclude any part of the psychiatrist's 
  evidence on the basis of its potential prejudicial effect. In his submissions, 
  counsel on appeal did take the court to parts of Klassen's evidence which he 
  argued were particularly prejudicial. Having reviewed those references we see 
  little or no prejudice to the appellant. Certainly the prejudice is not such 
  as to merit the exclusion of the evidence. </p>
<p>
  [10] Counsel also argued that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury on 
  the limited use it could make of the evidence concerning the appellant's prior 
  misconduct. The trial judge told the jury that they could use that evidence 
  only in assessing the basis upon which Dr. Klassen had advanced his opinion 
  concerning the appellant's propensity for violence. The trial judge also told 
  the jury that they could not use propensity reasoning in determining the appellant's 
  guilt. In our view, the instruction was full and accurate. </p>
<p>
  [11] Counsel also submitted that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury 
  that the evidence of Lake's disposition could be used as circumstantial evidence 
  identifying Lake as the perpetrator of the crime. It was common ground that 
  Lake had stabbed the deceased. The question was whether the appellant was also 
  involved in the stabbing as a perpetrator or abettor. The trial judge made it 
  clear to the jury that the evidence of Lake's disposition was relevant to the 
  question of whether he acted spontaneously and without the participation of 
  the appellant. Although the trial judge did not review the basis for the psychiatric 
  opinion concerning Lake he did remind the jury that Lake's predisposition to 
  violence was regarded as much stronger than the appellant's and included a significant 
  sadistic dimension. We have no doubt that the jury understood the evidence as 
  it related to Lake's disposition for violence and the purpose for which the 
  evidence was adduced. </p>
<p>
  The charge on circumstantial evidence </p>
<p>
  [12] The trial judge's instruction on circumstantial evidence made it clear 
  that to the extent that the jury relied on circumstantial evidence it could 
  convict, if based on the totality of the evidence, guilt was the &quot;only 
  rational and logical conclusion&quot;. This instruction was a proper application 
  of the burden of proof to inferences drawn from circumstantial evidence. </p>
<p>
  [13] Counsel contends that the trial judge did not tell the jury &quot;how a 
  reasonable doubt could arise depending upon the inferences it might draw from 
  the evidence&quot;. We cannot agree with this submission. The trial judge told 
  the jury, in the course of outlining the position of the defence, what inferences 
  the defence argued should or should not be drawn from the totality of the evidence. 
  Considered in its entirety the charge made it plain to the jury how a doubt 
  could arise from the entirety of the evidence, and particularly from the forensic 
  evidence. </p>
<p>
  [14] The appeal is dismissed. </p>
