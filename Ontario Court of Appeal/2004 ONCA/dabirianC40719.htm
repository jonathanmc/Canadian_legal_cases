<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] On April 7, 2003 Stayshyn J. made two orders. The first, in the standard 
  form, referred the matter to The Children's Lawyer to provide such services 
  under s. 89 and s. 112 of the Courts of Justice Act as she deems appropriate. 
</p>
<p>[2] The second provided that The Children's Lawyer "shall prepare" 
  a report by a worker other than the one who prepared an earlier report in this 
  case, back in 2001. This was apparently because the judge had developed a concern 
  based on his prior involvement in the case that it was not in the child's best 
  interests that the author of the earlier report be further involved.</p>
<p>[3] Both orders were made without notice to The Children's Lawyer.</p>
<p>[4] On September 2, 2003 the judge refused to vary this second order. In our 
  view, he erred in doing so. We see no jurisdiction in the judge of first instance 
  to require a report to be made or to require that it be authored by someone 
  other than a designated worker for the Office of the Children's Lawyer. While 
  the judge can request that if The Children's Lawyer decides to become involved 
  under s. 112 the resulting report be prepared by someone other than a designated 
  worker, it remains for The Children's Lawyer to decide whether to participate 
  on those terms. </p>
<p>[5] Where a debate like this arises there should be an opportunity for The 
  Children's Lawyer to appear before the judge to hear the judge's concerns and 
  to offer a response. That did not take place in this case.</p>
<p>[6] Thus we would set aside the order of September 2, 2003 and vary the second 
  order of April 7, 2003 by setting aside paragraph 1 and ordering that The Children's 
  Lawyer have the opportunity to attend before Stayshyn J. to respond to his concern 
  about the continuing involvement of the worker who prepared the first report.</p>
<p>[7] Thereafter it will be open to the judge to request that The Children's 
  Lawyer become involved on the basis that the new report be authored by another 
  worker. If that request is made, it will be up to The Children's Lawyer to determine 
  whether or not to participate on that basis.</p>
