<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant, D. D., was tried before Lack J. sitting with a jury. Following 
  a four-day trial, he was found guilty of extortion and compounding or concealing 
  an indictable offence. The finding with respect to the latter charge was conditionally 
  stayed pursuant to R. v. Kienapple (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 524. The appellant 
  was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment and two years probation. In addition, 
  a restitution order was made. The appellant appeals his conviction, seeks leave 
  to appeal the custodial portion of his sentence, and appeals that portion of 
  his sentence.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant's father, D. D. Sr., sexually abused the appellant's two young 
  daughters over a five-year period. It was alleged that upon finding out about 
  the sexual assaults, the appellant confronted his father and threatened to report 
  the matter to the police unless his father bought him a van, at a cost of $10,209, 
  and gave him $3,000 in cash.</p>
<p>
  [3] On August 28, 2000, a cheque in the amount of $3000 was drawn from the appellant's 
  parents' joint account and cashed by the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [4] On September 5, 2000, the appellant's father purchased a van for $10,209. 
  The van was immediately registered in the appellant's name.</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant testified that the purchase of the van was at his father's 
  instigation as an attempt to make amends and that the cheque in the amount of 
  $3,000 was in payment of a debt that his father owed him.</p>
<p>
  [6] The Crown's case depended upon phone messages left by the appellant on his 
  father's answering machine approximately one month after the purchase of the 
  van. Seven phone messages from the appellant were recorded over a one-week period; 
  the messages were recorded on four different microcassettes. The taped messages, 
  which were played for the jury, disclosed the appellant making demands for money. 
  </p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant acknowledged having left the messages for his father but testified 
  that the demands were not for the purpose of extorting money from his father 
  in exchange for remaining quiet about the sexual abuse. Rather, he said, the 
  demands were made at his mother's request. He testified that his mother had 
  decided to leave his father when she learned about the abuse and needed money 
  on which to live. The appellant's mother denied having asked him to obtain money 
  on her behalf.</p>
<p>
  [8] In testimony, the appellant said: </p>
<p class="indent"> It was all getting to me. I mean, I had my wife, and my wife 
  crying all the time and my daughters, so I started to have a few beers. I mean, 
  this was too much, you know. It all got to me and I started to have a few beers, 
  so I thought&#133;Mom said you know, "Try your best"&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">So, what I did is I phoned him on the phone and I said, well 
  I've got to get more forceful. He's not listening you know, so I started to 
  say what I said on the tapes you know. After five or six beers, I started to 
  say you know - get tougher and tougher, but it was over through the week and 
  I tried to you know - tried to make him you know do it.</p>
<p>
  [9] The Crown conceded, at trial, that the appellant could only be found guilty 
  if the jury was satisfied that the messages were left for the purpose of extorting 
  money in exchange for not disclosing the abuse.</p>
<p>
  THE CONVICTION APPEAL</p>
<p> [10] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in her charge to the 
  jury by failing to direct the jury to consider the appellant's state of mind 
  in light of his consumption of alcohol. <a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a></p>
<p>
  [11] We agree with the Crown that there was no air of reality to the defence 
  of intoxication. Although the appellant testified that he had consumed five 
  or six beers prior to leaving at least some of the messages, he did not testify 
  that he was intoxicated. The defence did not seek such an instruction and took 
  no objection to the jury charge on this matter. The appellant gave no evidence 
  concerning (1) the effect, if any, that the alcohol that he had consumed had 
  on him; (2) the time period over which he had consumed the five or six beers; 
  (3) how long after consuming the beer he had left the messages; or (4) which 
  of the messages he had left after consuming the beer. There was no evidence 
  of his size, weight or tolerance for alcohol. No expert evidence was called. 
  </p>
<p>
  [12] In R v. Cinous (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at 156 (S.C.C.), McLachlin C.J.C. 
  and Bastarache J. explained the basic features of the air of reality test: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The basic requirement of an evidential foundation for defences gives rise to 
  two well-established principles. First, a trial judge must put to the jury all 
  defences that arise on the facts, whether or not they have been specifically 
  raised by an accused. Where there is an air of reality to a defence, it should 
  go to the jury. Second, a trial judge has a positive duty to keep from the jury 
  defences lacking an evidential foundation. A defence that lacks an air of reality 
  should be kept from the jury.</p>
<p>
  As there was insufficient evidence to support a reasonable inference that the 
  appellant was intoxicated, it follows that the trial judge was not obliged to 
  relate the evidence of the appellant's alcohol consumption to the issue of his 
  state of mind. </p>
<p>
  THE SENTENCE APPEAL </p>
<p>
  [13] The appeal from sentence is based on the sentencing judge's alleged error 
  in failing to impose a conditional sentence.</p>
<p>
  [14] The appellant alleges that the error arose from the sentencing judge's 
  failure to give adequate consideration to the appellant's declaration of remorse. 
  In our view, as the sentencing judge expressly considered the appellant's expression 
  of remorse, there is no basis upon which to conclude that she failed to give 
  it adequate consideration. </p>
<p>
  [15] However, the sentencing judge did err in her findings in relation to the 
  appellant's circumstances. She stated, in her reasons for sentence, that: "He 
  [the appellant] does not, however, appear to be employed." In fact, the 
  evidence is that the family's income was based on the money that the appellant 
  earned on various projects, including Web development and songwriting. The only 
  other source of income for the family was babysitting money earned by the appellant's 
  wife. The evidence also discloses that the family applied for family benefits 
  in order to be able to survive economically in the event that the appellant 
  was incarcerated.</p>
<p>
  [16] As the sentencing judge erred, this court is entitled to intervene and 
  determine the appropriate sentence. In our view, on a full consideration of 
  the circumstances, the appellant's sentence should be reduced to time served. 
  The appellant was forty-four years of age at the time of sentencing. He had 
  a minor criminal record consisting of two convictions (theft under $1000 and 
  failure to attend court) from 1989. His twenty-one year relationship with his 
  wife was stable and committed. He and his wife lived with their four children 
  in a rural setting. The evidence disclosed that his children are very attached 
  to him and that it was the appellant who walked them to school, helped with 
  their homework and took them places. Not only was the appellant effectively 
  the sole source of financial support for his family, the appellant was the only 
  member of the family who could drive. His wife, four children and mother-in-law 
  relied on him for all of their transportation needs. The appellant's mother-in-law 
  had lived with the family for ten years at the time of sentencing. She was 74 
  years of age. The appellant and his wife both helped look after her. The family 
  home was heated by a wood stove. The appellant was responsible for chopping 
  the wood and maintaining the stove; his wife was unable to perform those functions 
  due to a back injury. In addition, and importantly, the appellant has already 
  served a significant portion of his sentence in jail.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [17] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed, leave to appeal sentence 
  is granted, the sentence appeal is allowed and the custodial portion of the 
  sentence is reduced to time served, all other aspects of the sentence to remain 
  the same. </p>

<hr>
<p> <a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> In his factum, the appellant alleged 
  that the error related to self-induced intoxication. At the hearing of the appeal, 
  however, counsel for the appellant conceded that the evidence did not establish 
  intoxication but only that the appellant had consumed some alcohol. </p>
