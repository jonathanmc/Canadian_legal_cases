<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Mr. D'Andrea appeals from his conviction for fraud and from the sentence 
  imposed of two years less a day. </p>
<p>
  Issues</p>
<p>
  [2] Mr. D'Andrea raises three issues on appeal:</p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Whether the trial judge misapprehended the appraisal evidence;</p>
<p class="indent">2. Whether the trial judge failed to properly consider Mr. D'Andrea's 
  allegedly honest belief in the value of the property; and</p>
<p class="indent">3. Whether the trial judge failed to properly consider the imposition 
  of a conditional sentence.</p>
<p>1. Misapprehension of the Appraisal Evidence</p>
<p>
  [3] Any misapprehension of the appraisal evidence is not relevant because Mr. 
  D'Andrea's guilt or innocence did not turn on the value of the property. In 
  any event, the trial judge carefully considered the four expert property appraisals. 
  He gave clear, cogent reasons for accepting, with one adjustment, the Lansink 
  appraisal. The other appraisals suffered from various weaknesses that the trial 
  judge identified, including the use of this very sale as a comparable (when 
  only 50% of the property was sold), the use of other inappropriate comparables, 
  the questionable use of adjustments, and, in one case, a personal attack on 
  the author of the Lansink appraisal, an attack that the trial judge found only 
  served to undermine the other appraiser's credibility. </p>
<p>
  [4] In the end, after reviewing all appraisals, the trial judge accepted the 
  adjusted Lansink valuation of $3.7 million as consistent with the $3.6 million 
  value cited in the shareholder agreement, and the $1.8 million price offered 
  for 50% of the property. Not only was the trial judge entitled to come to that 
  conclusion on the evidence, but we agree with that conclusion.</p>
<p>
  2. Honest Belief in the Value</p>
<p>
  [5] The Crown was not required to prove that the accused did not have an honest 
  belief as to the property's value; it was required to prove that the accused 
  committed a prohibited act - an act of deceit, falsehood, or other fraudulent 
  means - and that the prohibited act caused a deprivation evidenced by economic 
  loss, or risk of economic loss. Those are the elements of fraud: R. v. Theroux, 
  [1993] 2 S.C.R. 1175, 79 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [6] Accordingly, the accused's belief that the price was a reasonable one, or 
  that it was a good price for the investors, was irrelevant. In any event, the 
  trial judge heard and considered Mr. D'Andrea's evidence that he honestly believed 
  the value of the property fell within the $1.8 million range, that he believed 
  he was contributing his construction expertise for the other $1.8 million, that 
  he believed the offer was a reasonable one in all the circumstances, and that 
  he believed it was in the interests of the investors to accept the offer. The 
  trial judge also considered all the other evidence on this point, including 
  the accused's planning of this transaction and its structure, and the accused's 
  familiarity with land assembly and development. In the end, whatever his other 
  beliefs, the accused acknowledged that he not only received his interest in 
  the $1.8 million purchase price, but also received a 50% interest in the company 
  that owned the property. </p>
<p>
  [7] Mr. D'Andrea knew that $1.8 million was paid for a 50% interest in the property. 
  That knowledge flowed inevitably from his knowledge that the real estate commission 
  was based on a $3.6 million selling price and from his negotiations over the 
  terms of the shareholders' agreement. He knew he had a conflict. He retained 
  a separate lawyer to close the sale and concealed his planned ongoing involvement 
  with the property.</p>
<p>
  [8] Based on this, the trial judge found that the accused, who owed a fiduciary 
  duty to the investors, and who knew he stood to benefit from the transaction 
  to the detriment of the other investors, was under an obligation to disclose 
  to those investors both the particulars of the sale and his ongoing involvement 
  in the development. He did not do so, even when directly and repeatedly asked. 
  </p>
<p>
  [9] In addition to this deliberate deception, the trial judge found the investors 
  were not only left with the risk of economic harm, but that they also lost, 
  at a minimum, ownership of the 50% of the property that was not sold to the 
  vendors. They suffered a deprivation.</p>
<p>
  [10] In comprehensive and thorough reasons, the trial judge found that the Crown 
  had established the elements of fraud. There was ample evidence to support that 
  finding. We see no error - overriding, palpable, or otherwise. </p>
<p>
  3. Consideration of a Conditional Sentence</p>
<p>
  [11] At the sentencing hearing, the defence suggested an upper reformatory term 
  to be served as a conditional sentence and the Crown requested a penitentiary 
  term. The trial judge imposed the maximum reformatory term of two years less 
  one day.</p>
<p>
  [12] In deciding that a conditional sentence was inappropriate, the trial judge 
  considered that this was a "sizeable" fraud, that it exhibited both 
  planning and sophistication, that the accused breached a fiduciary duty to his 
  fellow shareholders, that he intended to benefit himself personally, that he 
  lied about his ongoing involvement with the development, and that he continued 
  for some time to conceal that involvement. In imposing a reformatory term, he 
  took into account all the mitigating circumstances, including the appellant's 
  efforts at restitution, his previously good character, and his contributions 
  to the community. While the trial judge did not accede to defence counsel's 
  request for a conditional sentence, he rejected the Crown's suggestion of a 
  penitentiary term and imposed the maximum reformatory term. In our view, the 
  sentence was demonstrably fit.</p>
<p>
  [13] In the result, the appeal from conviction is dismissed, leave to appeal 
  sentence is granted, and the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
