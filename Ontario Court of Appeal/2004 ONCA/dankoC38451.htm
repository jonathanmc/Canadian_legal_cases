<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We see no basis for interfering with the trial judge's conclusion that 
  the failure to construct a cathedral ceiling was a fundamental breach of the 
  agreement of purchase and sale. He also correctly concluded that the provision 
  entitling the vendor to make unilateral changes was not unlimited in scope and 
  did not apply to fundamental changes. </p>
<p>[2] The parties contracted for the construction of a new home which contained 
  a loft, for which the parties agreed to pay an additional $40,000, and a cathedral 
  ceiling over the family room. There was evidence upon which the trial judge 
  could find, both subjectively and objectively, that the cathedral ceiling was 
  a crucial feature in what was to be the purchasers' retirement home.</p>
<p>[3] With respect to the issue of affirmation, the evidence shows that once 
  the purchasers had actual knowledge, via a letter from the vendor, that their 
  home would not have this feature, they rescinded the agreement within two weeks 
  and sought the return of their $22,200 deposit. This delay does not constitute 
  affirmation of the ceiling's elimination. Even if, as the vendor argued, the 
  purchasers knew of the elimination of the cathedral ceiling in late October, 
  it was not entirely unreasonable for them to come to a decision six weeks later.</p>
<p>[4] The purchasers were entitled to have the house built in accordance with 
  their clear, contractually agreed upon expectations. Given the design of this 
  bungalow, the cathedral ceiling was integral to the contract. The vendor therefore 
  breached the agreement in a fundamental way and the purchasers were entitled 
  to the return of their deposit. The appeals are therefore dismissed with costs 
  fixed in the total amount of $10,000.</p>
