<p>On appeal from the order of Justice E. Fedak of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated March 26, 2003, allowing a summary conviction appeal from the conviction 
  imposed by Justice R.T. Weseloh at trial on January 24, 2002.</p>
<p>
  R.A. BLAIR J.A.: </p>
<p>
  Overview</p>
<p>
  [1] The Crown applies for leave to appeal an acquittal granted by the Summary 
  Conviction Appeal Court and, if leave be granted, appeals the acquittal.</p>
<p>
  [2] Mr. Danychuk was convicted in the Ontario Court of Justice on January 24, 
  2002, for failing to provide a breath sample, contrary to subsection 254(2) 
  of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. He had been stopped when a police 
  officer observed the car he was driving weaving between the driving lines. He 
  refused to provide a breath sample when requested by the police officer to do 
  so. </p>
<p>
  [3] The summary conviction appeal judge accepted the trial judge's finding that 
  Mr. Danychuk had refused to provide a breath sample as demanded. He set aside 
  the conviction, however, and entered an acquittal. He did so because, in his 
  view, the police officer had not made a valid demand pursuant to subsection 
  254(2) since the approved screening device was not proven to have been available 
  "forthwith" to be tested and presented to Mr. Danychuk. He held that 
  the procedure for requiring a breath sample to be provided forthwith under that 
  subsection entailed two requirements, namely,</p>
<p class="indent">(i) that the screening device be present at the scene and ready 
  to accept a sample of breath, having been tested to ensure that it was ready; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) that the officer making the demand under subsection 254(2) 
  present the screening device to the driver and explain the purpose of the test 
  and the consequences of failure to provide a sample of breath.</p>
<p>
  [4] The Crown submits that the summary conviction appeal judge erred in imposing 
  such prerequisites to a demand under subsection 254(2), particularly in the 
  context of an unequivocal refusal to provide a sample.</p>
<p>
  [5] I agree with the Crown's submission and would allow the appeal.</p>
<p>
  Facts</p>
<p>
  [6] The essential facts are not in dispute.</p>
<p>
  [7] Mr. Danychuk and another man, who was the owner of the vehicle in question, 
  were attending a charity golf event on May 8, 2001. During the event Mr. Danychuk 
  consumed two beers, one in the afternoon and the second between 8:30 and 9:30 
  in the evening. He and the other man left the event between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m., 
  and Mr. Danychuk, who was the designated driver and who was "in better 
  shape" than his friend, was driving. They were stopped by P.C. Potter and 
  another officer while driving on the Q.E.W. towards Niagara Falls because their 
  vehicle was observed weaving over the white intermittent lines of the lane. 
  </p>
<p>
  [8] P.C. Potter detected an odour of alcohol coming from the passenger's compartment 
  of the vehicle and asked the respondent whether he had been drinking. Mr. Danychuk 
  admitted he had had the two beers. There were no other external indicia of intoxication 
  noted by the police officer. On the basis of the driving pattern, the odour 
  of alcohol, and the admission, P.C. Potter requested Mr. Danychuk to accompany 
  him to the police cruiser for a test. It is not contested that he had reason 
  to suspect the respondent had alcohol in his body. Mr. Danychuk complied with 
  the request to go with the police officer, and was seated in the rear of the 
  cruiser.</p>
<p>
  [9] At 10:47 P.M., P.C. Potter demanded that Mr. Danychuk provide a sample of 
  his breath into an approved screening device. Mr. Danychuk categorically refused 
  to do so. The refusal to comply with the police officer's demand is admitted.</p>
<p>
  [10] P.C. Potter had an approved screening device with him in the front passenger 
  compartment of the cruiser (an Alcotest model calibrated on May 5, 2001). He 
  testified that the device had recently been calibrated and was sealed and in 
  proper working order, but that he, himself, had not conducted a test of the 
  apparatus. The following evidence of P.C. Potter is significant: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And your information was - what was your understanding as 
  to whether this approved screening device was in proper working order?</p>
<p class="indent">A. The fact that it had a seal on it and was calibrated, it 
  would've been in proper working order.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Okay. And where, where was it within your cruiser . . . when 
  you were speaking to the accused?</p>
<p class="indent">A. It was in the front passenger compartment; and I was in the 
  process of removing it from the package, plugging it in - and it does require 
  a warmup period. So, I was doing that while I was reading the demand to the 
  accused.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. All right. And the -you've indicated that the accused indicated 
  he was not going to provide a sample?</p>
<p class="indent">A. That is correct.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. What happened at - please continue, as to what further contact 
  you had with the accused?</p>
<p class="indent">A. At 10:53 p.m., I then cautioned him on failure to provide 
  a breath sample.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. When you say you "cautioned him", what, exactly, did you 
  tell him?</p>
<p class="indent">A. I said to him "If you do not provide a sample you will be 
  charged. It is a criminal charge."</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And where was the approved screening device at that time, 
  when you told him that?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Directly beside me.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And what, what happened then?</p>
<p class="indent">A. His response to that was "I'm driving my partner's car, I 
  would like to talk to him about where to leave the car."</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Please continue. What happened next?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Then at ten fifty-six I again asked the accused "Will you 
  provide a breath sample?" To which his response was "No, I will go to court."</p>
<p>
  [11] At 10:57 p.m. Mr. Danychuk was arrested for failure to provide a breath 
  sample. P.C. Potter then read him his rights to counsel and cautioned him in 
  the usual fashion. Mr. Danychuk declined to call counsel. At 11:06 p.m. he was 
  again asked to provide a breath sample, and again he refused to do so.</p>
<p>
  [12] The trial judge made the following findings: </p>
<p class="indent"> This Court has no doubt whatsoever that the Alco-test device 
  was placed in the cruiser as Police Constable Potter testified. That is, that 
  the device was on the front seat beside Police Constable Potter.</p>
<p class="indent">This Court has no doubt whatsoever that the Alco-test device 
  was available forthwith to be tested and presented to the accused person Mr. 
  Danychuk for him to provide a sample of his breath into the device [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p class="indent">This Court has no doubt that the accused was consistent and 
  clear in his refusal to comply with the breath demand made upon him by Police 
  Constable Potter. </p>
<p>[13] There was ample evidence to support these findings.</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>
  [14] The relevant portions of subsections 254(2) and (5) of the Criminal Code 
  state: </p>
<p class="indent"> 254(2) Where a peace officer reasonably suspects that a person 
  who is operating a motor vehicle . . . or who has the care or control of a motor 
  vehicle . . . has alcohol in the person's body, the peace officer may, by demand 
  made to that person, require the person to provide forthwith such a sample of 
  breath as in the opinion of the peace officer is necessary to enable a proper 
  analysis of the breath to be made by means of an approved screening device and, 
  where necessary, to accompany the peace officer for the purpose of enabling 
  such a sample of breath to be taken.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) Every one commits an offence who, without reasonable excuse, 
  fails or refuses to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer under 
  this section.</p>
<p>
  [15] The authorities have interpreted the requirement in subsection 254(2) that 
  the person "provide forthwith" a breath sample as imposing a duty 
  upon the police to be in a position to administer the test "forthwith", 
  that is, as soon as reasonably practicable or within a reasonable time having 
  regard to the provision and the circumstances of the case: see R. v. Latour 
  (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 150 (C.A.); R. v. Seo (1986), 54 O.R. (2d) 293 (C.A.); 
  R. v. Bernshaw, [1995], 1 S.C.R. 254. The rationale for this requirement is 
  that unless the police officer is in a position to require a breath sample to 
  be provided before there is any realistic opportunity for the detained person 
  to consult counsel, that person's s. 10(b) Charter right to counsel may be unjustifiably 
  infringed, and therefore a demand cannot be validly within the scope of subsection 
  254(2). "Otherwise", as Charron J.A. stated in Latour, supra, at 158: </p>
<p class="indent">
  the demand is outside the constitutionally permissible boundaries of the legislation 
  and is invalid. The meaning of the word "forthwith" must therefore 
  be defined in terms consonant with the outside limit on the limitation to the 
  right to counsel.</p>
<p>
  [16] Justice Charron relied upon the decision of this court in R. v. Cote (1992), 
  6 O.R. (3d) 667 (C.A.), where, after reviewing the basis for upholding the constitutionality 
  of the predecessor of subsection 254(2) as set out in R. v. Thomsen, [1988] 
  1 S.C.R. 640, Arbour J.A. said (at 671): </p>
<p class="indent">
  If the accused must be taken to a detachment, where contact with counsel could 
  more easily be accommodated than at the side of the road, a large component 
  of the rationale in Thomsen disappears. In other words, if the police officer 
  is not in a position to require that a breath sample be provided by the accused 
  before any realistic opportunity to consult counsel, then the officer's demand 
  is not a demand made under s. 238(2). The issue is thus not strictly one of 
  computing the number of minutes that fall within or without the scope of the 
  word "forthwith". . . However, in view of the circumstances, particularly 
  the wait at the police detachment, I conclude that the demand was not made within 
  s. 238(2). As the demand did not comply with s. 238(2), the appellant was not 
  required to comply with the demand and his refusal to do so did not constitute 
  and offence [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [17] Relying on these authorities and others, Mr. Fiorucci therefore argues 
  the Crown must show that the police were at the ready immediately before a demand 
  is made to administer the test and advise the motorist - whose Charter rights 
  are temporarily suspended by the detention - of the process and the consequences 
  of non-compliance. Otherwise, he submits, the demand is not to provide a sample 
  "forthwith" and is not a valid demand made under subsection 254(2). 
  </p>
<p>
  [18] In addition to this court's decisions in Cote and Latour, supra, Mr. Fiorucci 
  relies upon R. v. Matar, [1999] O.J. No. 4224, as did the summary conviction 
  appeal judge. In Matar a Superior Court judge ruled that a person is not exposed 
  to a charge of refusing to comply with a subsection 254(2) breath sample demand 
  until he or she is confronted with an approved screening device that is ready 
  for use - even if the person unequivocally refuses to provide a sample from 
  the outset. </p>
<p>
  [19] As I read the language of subsection 254(2) and appreciate its context, 
  however, I see nothing in it mandating - either expressly or by implication 
  - that before a demand may be made the approved screening device must be warmed 
  up and tested as operational and the police officer must have explained the 
  process and the consequences of a failure to comply. Respectfully, it is an 
  unwarranted extension of the foregoing authorities to read such requirements 
  into the section where the accused had categorically refused to provide the 
  requested breath sample, and the summary conviction appeal judge erred in law 
  in doing so.</p>
<p>
  [20] Mr. Danychuk refused, unequivocally, to provide a breath sample. This court 
  has held, in such circumstances, that the Crown need not even demonstrate the 
  device in question was an approved screening device as a prerequisite to a valid 
  demand: R. v. Lemieux (1990), 41 O.A.C. 326. In addition, this court and others 
  have held that in such circumstances the Crown does not have to show an approved 
  screening device was in the possession of, or immediately available to, the 
  police officer at the time of the demand: see R. v. Latour, supra; R v. McCauley 
  (1997), 161 N.S.R. (2d) 154 (N.S. C.A.); R. v. Wilson (1991), 121 B.C. A.C 111; 
  and R. v. Higgins (1994), 92 Man. R. (2d) 142 (C.A.). Other cases dealing with 
  similar propositions include R. v. Reimer, (1980), 4 M.V.R. 270 (Sask. Q.B.); 
  R. v. Sawicki, [1972] 6 W.W.R. 755 (Sask. C.A.); R. v. Kitchemonia (1973), 12 
  C.C.C. (2d) 225 (Sask. C.A.); R. v. Sullivan (1991), 65 C.C.C. (3d) 541 (B.C. 
  C.A.); R. v. Yake, [1992] O.J. No. 682 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.); R. v. Gutierrez 
  (2001), 21 M.V.R. (4th) 183 (Sup. Ct.); and, R. v. Farkas, [2002] O.J. No. 4682 
  (Ont. Ct. J.).</p>
<p>
  [21] In my opinion, while it may be sensible for a police officer to make sure 
  the device is working and the motorist apprised of the process and the consequences 
  of non-compliance, it cannot be said - in the face of these authorities - that 
  these matters constitute prerequisites to a valid demand for a breath sample 
  under subsection 254(2), in my opinion. To adopt the language of Hughes J. in 
  R. v. Reimer (1980), 4 M.V.R. 270 (Sask. Q.B.) - cited with approval in Lemieux 
  (at 329): </p>
<p class="indent">
  To say yes to the question posed at the outset of this judgment would be to 
  require the Crown to cross a barrier or hurdle without, as far as I can see, 
  a useful purpose being thereby served.</p>
<p>
  [22] In Lemieux, supra, at 328, the court agreed with the Crown's submission 
  that "the gravamen of the offence under ss. 254(2) and (5) of the Criminal 
  Code is failure or refusal to comply with the demand of a peace officer": 
  see also McCauley, supra. It is the failure or refusal to comply with the demand 
  to provide the breath sample that is at the core of the infraction, not the 
  failure or refusal to provide the breath sample "forthwith". The word 
  "forthwith" in subsection 254(2) does not define the substance of 
  the offence. Rather, it imposes on the person to whom the demand is made an 
  obligation to comply in a timely fashion, and on the authorities an obligation 
  to conduct the test in a timely fashion once the request is honoured in order 
  that the detainee's rights to counsel under section 10(b) of the Charter are 
  minimally impaired. </p>
<p>
  [23] A demand will not be a valid demand under subsection 254(2) if the police 
  are not in a position to administer the test "forthwith", i.e. in 
  a timely fashion before there is any realistic opportunity to consult counsel: 
  Cote, supra; Latour, supra. However, these cases do not stand for the proposition 
  that the police must be in a position to "make the demand good" the 
  instant the request is made. In fact, the opposite is true. In Latour, at 159-60, 
  Charron J.A. specifically rejected this notion: </p>
<p class="indent"> . . . According to [the appeal court judge's] reasoning, unless 
  the peace officer reasonably believes that he or she can "make the demand good" 
  at the time it is made, the demand is not valid even if the sample is, in actual 
  fact, received into an approved screening device a few moments later.</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, Parliament did not require that the peace officer 
  have this belief. The section simply provides that, prior to making the demand, 
  the peace officer must reasonably suspect that a person who is operating a motor 
  vehicle . . . has alcohol in his or her body. If the peace officer forms the 
  required suspicion, he or she may make a demand that the person provide "forthwith" 
  a sample of breath for analysis in an approved screening device. Of course, 
  the peace officer who makes such a demand is under a duty to act upon it within 
  the statutory limits. If, as the events actually unfold, the peace officer is 
  in a position to require the person to provide the sample before there is any 
  realistic opportunity to consult counsel, the statutory requirements are met. 
  The detained person has no cause for complaint as the events will have unfolded 
  in accordance with the legislative scheme and within its constitutional boundaries 
  [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [24] Thus, Latour and Cote do not support the respondent's contention that at 
  the time of the demand the police must have the screening device available immediately 
  to be tested and presented to the detained motorist.</p>
<p>
  [25] Another line of authorities indicates that in circumstances where there 
  has been an "unsuccessful attempt" to provide a breath sample - either 
  because of efforts by the person subject to the request to feign compliance, 
  or because of a faulty device - the Crown may be required to lead evidence to 
  show the screening device was in good working order: see R. v. Lumley, [1988] 
  O.J. No. 2521 (Prov. Ct. (Crim. Div.)); Yake, supra; Gutierrez, supra; R. v. 
  Weir (1989), 78 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 260 (S.C. (T.D.)); and, Farkas, supra. 
  These cases are founded on the theory that such proof may be necessary lest 
  the evidence raise a reasonable doubt the unsuccessful attempt was due to a 
  flaw in the device. They do not lead to the conclusion, though, that the Crown 
  must show that the police could have "made the demand good" as a condition 
  of obtaining a conviction under subsection 254(2).</p>
<p>
  [26] A timely demand is validly made pursuant to subsection 254(2), in my opinion, 
  where (a) the individual to whom the demand is made has been operating a motor 
  vehicle, or has care or control of that vehicle, (b) the peace officer who makes 
  the demand reasonably suspects that the individual to whom the demand is being 
  made has alcohol in his or her body, and (c) the police officer is ultimately 
  in a position to require that the breath sample be provided before there is 
  any realistic opportunity to consult counsel. Where, as here, there has been 
  an outright refusal to provide a breath sample, it is not a prerequisite to 
  such a demand that the Crown establish the approved screening device was present 
  at the scene, tested and ready to accept a sample, or that the police officer 
  presented the device to the driver and explained the purpose of the test and 
  the consequences of a failure to provide a sample.</p>
<p>
  [27] On the facts of this case the trial judge found that the screening device 
  was available forthwith for Mr. Danychuk to provide a sample of his breath into 
  it. There is no basis for interfering with that finding.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [28] I would accordingly grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, and restore 
  the conviction imposed on Mr. Danychuk at trial.</p>
