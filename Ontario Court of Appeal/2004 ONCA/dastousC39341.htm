<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Charges were laid after an altercation between the appellant and his former 
  employer. At trial, the appellant was found guilty of assault, uttering a death 
  threat, attempting to choke with the intent to commit an indictable offence 
  and extortion. The trial judge's reasons for judgment consist of 5 paragraphs 
  that run just slightly over a page in length. </p>
<p>[2] After acknowledging that there was "a total conflict" between 
  the version of events offered by the complainant as opposed to that offered 
  by the appellant, the trial judge stated:</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; I agree with the submissions of the Crown, I adopt all 
  of the Crown's submissions. Her submissions are to be deemed [to be] part and 
  parcel of these brief reasons. </p>
<p>[3] This court has noted the dangers inherent in simply adopting the Crown's 
  submissions in their entirety and cautioned against following such a process, 
  saying that it "should generally be avoided because of the legitimate miscarriage 
  of justice concerns it raises". See R. v. Gaudet (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 
  17 at para. 55. </p>
<p>[4] The dangers associated with simply adopting the Crown's submissions are 
  realized in the instant case. The Crown submitted that the alleged threat by 
  the appellant occurred as the appellant was choking the complainant. This appears 
  to have been an error. In the Crown's submissions, the marks on the complainant's 
  neck were said to be "consistent with a choking pattern". In our view, 
  the marks appear to be consistent as well with the appellant's testimony as 
  to how the complainant came to receive such marks. The trial judge states "I 
  agree with the Crown's submission, for example, that the injuries &#133; are 
  wholly consistent with the theory of the Crown, and wholly inconsistent with 
  the theory of the defence". The Crown did not make the latter submission. 
  In addition to misquoting the Crown's submission on that point, the trial judge 
  appears to have misapprehended the evidence since the injuries could not be 
  said to be wholly inconsistent with the appellant's evidence. </p>
<p>[5] Moreover, the reasons are insufficient. We are unable to perform a meaningful 
  review of the reasons as they do not identify the important issues nor do they 
  provide reasons for the conclusions reached. See R. v. Sheppard (2002), 162 
  C.C.C. (S.C.C.). For example, it appears that the trial judge based his decision 
  on a preference for the complainant's evidence over that of the appellant. However, 
  he began by saying: "Notwithstanding the tone of the audiotape, I am prepared 
  to accept the evidence of the complainant". He concluded that "a good 
  deal of it [the appellant's evidence] did not really make sense" but gives 
  no reasons for that conclusion. As the case hinged largely on credibility, the 
  trial judge was obliged to give reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence, 
  particularly when he prefaced his acceptance of the complainant's testimony 
  with the words "Notwithstanding the tone of the audiotape", which 
  suggest to us that the audiotape raised a question in the trial judge's mind 
  about what transpired in the altercation. </p>
<p>[6] Furthermore, it appears that the trial judge, having adopted the Crown's 
  submission that the outcome of the case turned on choosing one version or the 
  other, based his decision on a credibility contest between the appellant and 
  the complainant. </p>
<p>[7] For these reasons, the appeal is allowed and the matter remitted for a 
  new trial.</p>
