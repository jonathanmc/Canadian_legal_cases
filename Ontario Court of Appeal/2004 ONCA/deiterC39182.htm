<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Release Orally: March 5, 2004</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant father asks this court to overturn the decision of Wallace 
  J. in which she ordered him to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines. 
  The father's primary argument is based on the separation agreement that he and 
  the mother of the children had entered into which gave the mother a far greater 
  share of the matrimonial property and in which the father gave up any claim 
  to spousal support. These, he says are "special provisions" that directly 
  or indirectly benefit the children such that application of the Guidelines results 
  in an amount of child support that is inequitable.</p>
<p>
  [2] Justice Wallace refused to recalculate the net matrimonial property, which 
  is effectively what the father is asking for. Wallace J., at para. 7 of her 
  endorsement, says this:</p>
<p class="indent"> Because of the complete absence of financial or net family 
  property statements, it is not possible to know how any of the factors like 
  property value, contribution, renovation, loans, gifting and tax implications 
  were factored into the ultimate agreement these parties negotiated with their 
  counsel.</p>
<p>
  [3] We agree with this statement and decline to enter into the type of financial 
  review that the father requests. In so concluding, we are mindful of the fact 
  that both parties had independent legal advice when they executed the separation 
  agreement and that there is nothing in the separation agreement to suggest that 
  the unequal division of family property is to reduce the quantity of child support. 
  The father had the burden to show that special provision was made and we are 
  not satisfied that he has discharged this burden.</p>
<p>
  [4] The issue before Wallace J., and the real issue before this court, is the 
  question of child support. We see no basis upon which to interfere with the 
  decision below. The applications judge properly begins her analysis by noting 
  that parents cannot contract away a child's right to support. Willick v. Willick, 
  (1994) 3 S.C.R., 670 at para. 16. Thus, the mother's purported release to any 
  child support claims in the separation agreement is of no effect. Further, the 
  applications judge correctly applied this court's decision in Wright v. Zaver, 
  [2002] O.J. No. 1098, by approaching the matter of special provisions objectively 
  and with a child?centred focus. We see no error in her conclusion that there 
  was no special benefit direct or indirect to the children from the separation 
  agreement. Even if there were, the applications judge found that she could not 
  conclude, in the circumstances, that it would be inequitable to require the 
  father to pay child support in the Guideline amounts. We agree.</p>
<p>
  [5] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. Costs to the respondent fixed in the 
  amount of $4,500, all inclusive.</p>
