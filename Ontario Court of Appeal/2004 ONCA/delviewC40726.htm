<p>On appeal from a judgment of the Divisional Court (O'Driscoll, Then, and Hambley 
  JJ.) dated July 10, 2003.</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  SIMMONS J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] The issues on this appeal relate to the effect of s. 241(5) of the Business 
  Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, as amended by S.O. 1999, c. 12, Sched. 
  F, s. 9 ("OBCA"), which provides a mechanism for the revival of corporations 
  dissolved for failing to comply with certain filing requirements under the OBCA. 
  This version of s. 241(5) of the OBCA came into force March 27, 2000 and will 
  be referred to as the "2000 OBCA revival provision". It provides that: 
  "upon revival, the corporation, subject to &#133; the rights &#133; acquired 
  by any person during the period of dissolution, shall be deemed &#133; to have 
  never been dissolved". </p>
<p> [2] The main issue on appeal is whether a revived corporation can proceed 
  with a construction lien action, where the time limits under the Construction 
  Lien Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30 ("CLA") for preserving and perfecting the claim 
  for lien expired while the corporation was dissolved.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [3] A secondary issue involves whether the property owner can resist the revived 
  company's claim in contract, even though that claim is not statute-barred, because 
  the revived company failed to apply for revival within the five-year time limit 
  specified in a predecessor to the 2000 OBCA revival provision. </p>
<p>
  I. The Order Under Appeal</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant appeals from a judgment of the Divisional Court dated July 
  10, 2003. The Divisional Court dismissed the appellant's appeal from an order 
  of Snowie J., which vacated the appellant's claim for lien and certificate of 
  action. In addition, the Divisional Court allowed the respondent's cross-appeal 
  from the motion judge's order permitting the appellant's contract claim to continue, 
  and dismissed the appellant's action. </p>
<p>
  II. Background</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant registered a construction lien against the respondent's property 
  on October 26, 1998. On November 4, 1998, the appellant commenced an action 
  against the respondent, claiming payment of the balance owing under a construction 
  contract and enforcement of its claim for lien.</p>
<p>
  [6] Following completion of examinations for discovery, the respondent moved 
  for an order dismissing the appellant's action and vacating the appellant's 
  claim for lien on the grounds that the appellant was not an existing corporation 
  at the time the lien was registered and the action commenced. The respondent 
  filed evidence on the motion setting out the following chronology: </p>
<p class="indent"> i) Delview Construction Limited was incorporated on February 
  2, 1999, which was approximately three months after the appellant's lien was 
  registered and its action commenced; </p>
<p class="indent">ii) the principal of Delview Construction Limited incorporated 
  another company, 826744 Ontario Limited ("826744"), on March 21, 1989; </p>
<p class="indent">iii) 826744 carried on business under the registered style name 
  Delview Construction from April 13, 1989 until April 12, 1994, when the registration 
  of the style name expired; and </p>
<p class="indent">iv) 826744 was dissolved by the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial 
  Relations on February 18, 1995.</p>
<p>
  [7] In response to the respondent's motion, the appellant requested an order 
  permitting it to amend its statement of claim and claim for lien by substituting 
  the name "826744 Ontario Limited carrying on business as Delview Construction" 
  for the name "Delview Construction Limited", and filed evidence confirming 
  that 826744 was revived on January 16, 2002.</p>
<p>
  III. Analysis</p>
<p>
  [8] I agree with the Divisional Court's conclusion concerning the appellant's 
  lien claim. The orders vacating the claim for lien and certificate of action 
  must stand. </p>
<p>
  [9] Assuming, without deciding, that naming Delview Construction Limited as 
  the lien claimant in the claim for lien was a misnomer that could be corrected 
  by s. 6 of the CLA, I conclude that the appellant is precluded from relying 
  on the provisions of the 2000 OBCA revival provision to revive its action. I 
  reach this conclusion because the time periods stipulated in the CLA for registering 
  and perfecting the appellant's construction lien expired prior to the revival 
  of 826744.</p>
<p>
  [10] The 2000 revival provision provides that upon revival, a previously dissolved 
  corporation is subject to the rights acquired by any person during the period 
  of dissolution: </p>
<p class="indent">
  241(5) Where a corporation is dissolved under subsection (4) or any predecessor 
  of it, the Director on the application of any interested person, may, in his 
  or her discretion &#133; revive the corporation; upon revival, the corporation, 
  subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the Director and to the rights, 
  if any, acquired by any person during the period of dissolution, shall be deemed 
  for all purposes to have never been dissolved [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [11] In 602533 Ontario Inc. v. Shell Canada Limited (1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 504 
  (C.A.), this court confirmed that a defendant acquires "rights" within 
  the meaning of s. 241(5) of the OBCA by virtue of the passage of a limitation 
  period. Some courts have held that the time limits for completing various steps 
  stipulated in the CLA are not the same as a limitation period: see Benjamin 
  Schultz &amp; Associates Limited v. Samet (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 771 (Div. Ct.) 
  dealing with the time limit for fixing a trial date. However, in finding a distinction, 
  the courts have noted that, unlike limitation periods where there is a discretion 
  to extend under the Basarsky v. Quinlan, [1972] S.C.R. 380 line of cases, the 
  time limits set out in the CLA are prescribed by statute and "[leave] no 
  room for judicial discretion". Given the nature of this distinction, I 
  conclude that, to the extent there is any difference between the expiry of the 
  time limits stipulated in the CLA for registering and perfecting lien claims 
  and the passage of a limitation period, the former present an equally compelling 
  case for constituting a "rights" within the meaning of s. 241(5) of 
  the OBCA.</p>
<p>
  [12] However, I do not agree with the Divisional Court's conclusion that the 
  appellant's breach of contract action should be dismissed at this time. Because 
  the limitation period for that action will not expire until later this year, 
  I conclude that it is not obvious that the appellant's claim has no chance of 
  success, and that applying rule 26 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, 
  Reg. 194 ("Rules"), the amendment should be allowed.</p>
<p> [13] In this court, the respondent advanced three reasons for resisting the 
  appellant's request to substitute the name 826744 for the name Delview Construction 
  Limited in its statement of claim: i) 826744 Ontario Limited was not a contracting 
  party and the proposed action therefore has no chance of success; ii) an action 
  commenced in the name of a non-existing corporation is a nullity and cannot 
  be amended; and iii) the version of s. 241(5) of the OBCA that was in force 
  at the time the action was commenced<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> ("1990 
  OBCA revival provision") gave the Director a discretion to revive a corporation 
  only where an application for revival was "made within five years after the 
  date of dissolution". </p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  [14] In relation to the respondent's third reason, the five-year time limit 
  for the appellant to apply for revival under the 1990 OBCA revival provision 
  expired on February 17, 2000. This was one month before the 2000 OBCA revival 
  provision came into force, and almost two years before 826744 applied for revival. 
  The respondent therefore contends that 826744 lost its claim to revive the contract 
  action for at least some period of time during the dissolution period, and that 
  he is entitled to rely on 826744's loss as "a right" within the meaning 
  of the 2000 revival provision. Put another way, the respondent contends that 
  he is entitled to rely on "rights" he acquired under the 1990 revival 
  provision: see s. 14(1) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.11.</p>
<p>
  [15] I reject all of the respondent's submissions. </p>
<p>
  [16] The respondent's first submission is a defence grounded in facts and should 
  be determined on a proper record after amended pleadings have been exchanged. 
  Moreover, because it appears that there may be conflicting evidence on the identities 
  of the contracting parties, this issue may require a trial for a proper resolution.</p>
<p>
  [17] As for the respondent's second submission, pleadings and discoveries had 
  already been completed at the time these motions were heard. I note that in 
  602533 Ontario Inc., supra, although the action was commenced at a time when 
  the revived corporation was dissolved, the court dismissed only the statute-barred 
  claims, and not the entire action. In keeping with rule 1.04 requiring that 
  the Rules be liberally construed "to secure the just, most expeditious 
  and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding on its merits", 
  I conclude that it is open to a court to make a retroactive order validating 
  the action, once a dissolved corporation is revived. </p>
<p>
  [18] In this case, the motion judge did not make a specific order amending the 
  statement of claim and claim for lien in the manner that the appellant had requested 
  nor did she make an order retroactively validating the action. However, unlike 
  the Divisional Court, which viewed Delview Construction Limited as the claimant, 
  the motion judge treated the issue before her as one of misnomer and permitted 
  the contract claim to continue. I take it as being implicit in her order that 
  she considered that this was an appropriate case for making an order substituting 
  the name 826744 for the appellant's name in the statement of claim and validating 
  the action retroactively. Subject to my comments concerning the third issue 
  raised by the respondent, I see no basis for interfering with the motion judge's 
  approach. </p>
<p>
  [19] As for the respondent's third submission, I conclude that it raises a defence 
  that may be grounded in facts and therefore should be determined on a proper 
  record after amended pleadings have been exchanged. While the respondent may 
  be correct that, once the five-year time limit for revival had passed, there 
  was no means of reviving 826744 until the 2000 OBCA revival provision came into 
  force, the appellant submitted otherwise in oral argument. This issue was not 
  addressed in either set of reasons from the courts below. In my view, the question 
  of what, if any, rights the respondent acquired under the 1990 revival provisions 
  should not be determined without giving the appellant the opportunity to address 
  the issue fully by way of pleadings and, if required, evidence concerning the 
  operation of revival provisions predating the 2000 OBCA revival provision.</p>
<p>
  IV. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [20] For the reasons given, I would allow the appeal in part, by setting aside 
  the order of the Divisional Court dismissing the appellant's action and by substituting 
  an order: i) permitting the appellant to substitute the name 826744 for the 
  name Delview Construction Limited in the statement of claim; ii) validating 
  the amended statement of claim effective November 4, 1998; and iii) authorizing 
  826744 to proceed with the appellant's contract action. In addition, I would 
  stipulate that the substituted order is subject to a term that it is without 
  prejudice to any defences that may be raised with respect to rights acquired 
  during the period in which 826744 was dissolved and which version of s. 241(5) 
  of the OBCA should be applied in determining any such issues. </p>
<p>
  [21] As success on the appeal was divided, I would make no order as to costs 
  of the appeal. I would also set aside the costs order made by the Divisional 
  Court and order that there be no costs of the appeal and cross-appeal to the 
  Divisional Court and that the order of the motion judge concerning costs of 
  the motion be restored. </p>

  the validity, proper preservation or perfection of the lien under which it is 
  sheltered. <br>
