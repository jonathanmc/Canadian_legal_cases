<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We read the trial judge&#8217;s reasons (paras. 24 and 36) as holding that 
  adjustments to the contract price based on additional excavation and haulage 
  costs were to be governed by the letter of June 3, 1997, which specifically 
  anticipated those adjustments, and not by the terms of Article 12 of the contract, 
  which governed work changes in general. We agree with this interpretation. The 
  conduct of the parties at the time is entirely consistent with the trial judge&#8217;s 
  interpretation.</p>
<p> [2] The letter provided that the charges for excavation and haulage would 
  be &#8220;adjusted&#8221; if more than the anticipated number of truck loads 
  had to be removed from the construction site. The bid form, which was also part 
  of the contract, provided that &#8220;the unit prices attached as Schedule A 
  will govern adjustments to the work&#8221; [emphasis added]. Schedule A set 
  out various unit prices and provided that those prices could be used by the 
  contractor in computing the value of additions to the contract. The respondent 
  invoiced the appellant for additional excavation and haulage costs based on 
  those unit prices. Since we are satisfied that Article 12 of the contract did 
  not apply, the respondent was entitled to use the unit prices set out in Schedule 
  A to quantify the adjustment necessitated by the extra excavation and haulage.</p>
<p> [3] Counsel for the appellant conceded in this court that the respondent was 
  entitled to compensation for the extra excavation and haulage, but argued, relying 
  primarily on Article 12 of the contract, that the respondent&#8217;s compensation 
  should be based on his costs plus 10 per cent. Counsel further argued that the 
  trial judge had improperly interfered with trial counsel&#8217;s cross-examination 
  as to the respondent&#8217;s costs. </p>
<p> [4] We are satisfied, as indicated above, that Article 12 of the contract 
  does not apply. Consequently, we must reject the argument that the respondent&#8217;s 
  compensation should have been determined according to the costs plus 10 per 
  cent provision in that Article. We also cannot agree that the trial judge improperly 
  interfered with cross-examination. The argument that the respondent&#8217;s 
  compensation should be determined on the basis of his costs plus 10 per cent 
  was not pleaded and was not advanced at trial. The appellant&#8217;s argument 
  at trial was that the respondent was entitled to nothing.</p>
<p> [5] For the reasons set out above, we would dismiss the appeal with costs 
  to the respondent in the total amount of $10,000.00.</p>
