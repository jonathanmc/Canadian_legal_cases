<p>On appeal from a conviction by Justice M. Girard dated January 22, 2003, and 
  from the sentence imposed on May 6, 2003.</p>
<p>THERE IS A PUBLICATION BAN IN PLACE CONCERNING THIS MATTER, PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 
  486(3) AND 517 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE.</p>
<p>
  R. A. BLAIR J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant seeks to set aside his conviction, after a plea of guilty, 
  on charges of sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching. In addition, 
  he applies for leave to appeal against sentence, and if leave be granted, appeals 
  the sentence of twelve months custody (concurrent) on each charge.</p>
<p>
  [2] The conviction appeal is grounded on the allegation that the appellant was 
  under the age of eighteen at the time the offences occurred. Therefore - it 
  is argued - the adult court in which the plea was taken and the conviction registered 
  had no jurisdiction and the matter must be remitted to youth court for determination 
  under the Youth Criminal Justice Act S.C. 2002, c.1.</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [3] Except for the dates upon which the offences are said to have occurred, 
  the background and facts are not in dispute.</p>
<p>
  [4] The victim is the appellant's young cousin, who was between the ages of 
  five and seven at the time the offences occurred. Her father and the appellant's 
  father are brothers. She disclosed the incidents to her parents on August 4, 
  2002.</p>
<p>
  [5] The offences occurred over a period of fifteen months to two years while 
  the appellant was babysitting the complainant and her brother. He admits that 
  he kissed the complainant on the lips more than ten times, that he performed 
  oral sex on her twice, that on one occasion he put his penis on her rear-end 
  in the crack of her buttocks and ejaculated, and that he twice tried to penetrate 
  her vagina with his penis but did not want to hurt her so he never successfully 
  did so. The appellant also admitted asking the complainant to perform oral sex 
  on him and that she did put her mouth on his penis on one occasion. He told 
  the police initially that these events had happened while he was "seventeen, 
  eighteen" and that they had transpired over a period of fifteen months. 
  The complainant further alleged that when kissing her the appellant would sometimes 
  try to put his tongue in her mouth and that, while she was naked from the waist 
  down, he would put his mouth and tongue around her vaginal area but not in the 
  hole. These facts were accepted at the time of the guilty plea.</p>
<p> [6] From the outset, the appellant has admitted the sexual assaults and touching. 
  He is remorseful and, by all accounts, is seriously attempting to deal with 
  the problems relating to and arising out of the offences. He agreed to plead 
  guilty, and did so to two counts on January 22, 2003. Two charges were withdrawn. 
  At that time the Information was amended to charge that the offences occurred 
  between August 4, 1999 (the date of the appellant's eighteenth birthday) and 
  April 20, 2001 in order to ensure that he was not convicted for things that 
  had happened while he was a young person.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [7] A pre-sentence report was ordered and a psychological assessment obtained. 
  Submissions as to sentence were heard on May 6, 2003. The trial judge rejected 
  the appellant's request for a conditional sentence and imposed twelve months 
  in custody (concurrent on both counts) plus three years probation. There was 
  also an order pursuant to section 161 of the Criminal Code and a DNA order.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  Conviction Appeal</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant contends that the guilty plea in adult court was the result 
  of a failure on his part, and on the part of his parents, to appreciate that 
  the dates on which the offences were alleged to have occurred were important. 
  He says they thought what was significant was the fact that the offences had 
  occurred and that he was willing to plead guilty; consequently, they were focusing 
  on those matters with a view to ending their ordeal. Only when preparing for 
  the sentence appeal and reviewing the transcripts, the appellant says, did he 
  and his parents realize that the incidents had really occurred prior to his 
  eighteenth birthday.</p>
<p>
  [9] Central to the appeal is an application for the admission of fresh evidence 
  designed to show that, in fact, the offences all occurred before the appellant 
  turned eighteen. The fresh evidence consists of affidavits from the appellant, 
  his mother and father, and the lawyer who acted for him at the time of the plea. 
  Each of these deponents has been cross-examined.</p>
<p>
  [10] We are not prepared to admit the fresh evidence. </p>
<p>
  [11] The Supreme Court of Canada has articulated the well-known test for the 
  admission of fresh evidence on appeal in R v. Palmer [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 at 
  p. 775, and more recently in R v. Warsing [1998] 3 S.C.R. 579. This Court repeated 
  the test in R v. Folland (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 290 at p. 300, stating: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In that case (i.e. Warsing), Major J., speaking for the court on this issue, 
  affirmed that the test for admission of fresh evidence is as set down in R v. 
  Palmer [citations omitted]: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due 
  diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle 
  will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases; [citations 
  omitted]</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears 
  upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial;</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably 
  capable of belief; and</p>
<p class="indent">(4) It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when 
  taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected 
  the result.</p>
<p class="indent">Major J. also confirmed, at para. 51, that due diligence is 
  a factor to be considered, but not a prerequisite to admissibility: "It is desirable 
  that due diligence remain only one factor and its absence, particularly in criminal 
  cases, should be assessed in light of other circumstances. If the evidence is 
  compelling and the interests of justice require that it be admitted then the 
  failure to met the test should yield to permit its admission." He also adopted 
  the view expressed by Carthy J.A. in R v. C. (R.) (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 84 
  (Ont. C.A.) at p. 87 that a failure to meet the due diligence requirement should 
  not "override accomplishing a just result".</p>
<p>
  [12] The proposed fresh evidence does not meet these requirements. Here, the 
  appellant has some obstacles to overcome regarding due diligence. More problematic 
  for him, however, is the fact the proposed fresh evidence does not sustain his 
  contention that the offences occurred before his eighteenth birthday or that 
  the importance of this issue was not brought home at least to his father prior 
  to the guilty plea. The latter factor gives rise to due diligence concerns. 
  The former shows that, although the fresh evidence bears on a decisive issue 
  at trial, it is neither credible nor - even if believed - could it be expected 
  to have affected the result, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial. 
  I have reached this conclusion based upon the following.</p>
<p>
  [13] In his affidavit, the appellant deposes that he had stopped babysitting 
  regularly for his aunt and uncle "a month or two prior to turning eighteen". 
  He states he was working that summer and did not have time, nor did he want 
  to, babysit. His parents put forward four reasons in their affidavits as to 
  why the events must have occurred prior to the appellant's eighteenth birthday, 
  namely, that</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) during his last year in grade 12 in high school, the appellant 
  was too busy with school and hockey to babysit his cousins;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the complainant's father was on layoff and the complainant's 
  family may have had a full-time babysitter;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the appellant was working full-time for a maintenance company 
  during the summer and did not want to babysit; and</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the next year he was in college full time and with his schedule 
  couldn't work.</p>
<p>
  [14] However, on cross-examination the appellant admitted that the offences 
  occurred while he was in grade 12 and after the complainant's family had moved 
  to their home on Commercial Street. The appellant entered grade 12 - his final 
  year of high school - in September 1999, one month after his eighteenth birthday, 
  and the complainant's family started living on Commercial Street in September 
  1999. On his own admission, therefore - and in harmony with his statements to 
  the police at the time of his arrest - the offences did take place after he 
  turned eighteen.</p>
<p>
  [15] This is consistent with the information provided by his lawyer, Mr. Frith, 
  on cross-examination as well. Mr. Frith's notes indicate that during his first 
  interview with the appellant's father, the appellant's father told him the offences 
  occurred over a two-year period and during the appellant's last year of high 
  school. Mr. Frith also acknowledged that he canvassed the question of the appellant's 
  age with the father during that conversation because he was calculating what 
  year the appellant became an "adult", recognizing as he did, the consequences 
  of that date for the charges. He communicated the importance of this fact to 
  the appellant's father (although he could not say he had done so during the 
  initial telephone conversation).</p>
<p>
  [16] In addition, Mr. Frith revealed that following receipt of the disclosure 
  brief from the Crown, he forwarded it to the appellant and his parents and asked 
  them for comments. The brief makes it clear that the period covered by the charges 
  included the period of August 4, 1999 (the appellant's birthday) to April 20, 
  2001. The brief was returned to Mr. Frith with certain notes made on it, but 
  there was no suggestion that the offences had not taken place while the appellant 
  was an adult. The only concern expressed by the appellant's family about the 
  dates of the offences was a question about the year 2001, when the appellant 
  was attending college and would not have been babysitting his cousin.</p>
<p>
  [17] Thus, the proposed fresh evidence confirms, rather than contradicts, that 
  (a) some of the offences occurred after the appellant's eighteenth birthday, 
  and (b) the appellant's father was aware of the significance of that fact prior 
  to the guilty plea. </p>
<p>
  [18] Moreover, the appellant and his father admit they heard the dates of the 
  charges being read out in court. The trial judge himself questioned counsel 
  about the appellant's date of birth and the duration of the offences to ensure 
  himself that the appellant was an adult during the period of the charges. The 
  facts that were read into evidence to support the plea included reference to 
  the appellant's videotaped statement to the police, during the course of which, 
  Crown counsel said, the appellant had "confessed that when he was 17 and 
  18 he would babysit [the complainant] at the Commercial Street address". 
  The facts read in were acknowledged to be correct by the appellant's counsel. 
  All of these circumstances militate against the appellant's contention that 
  neither he nor his parents gave any serious thought to the dates upon which 
  the offences occurred until an appeal was subsequently being considered.</p>
<p>
  [19] The application to introduce the fresh evidence must be dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [20] The onus is on the appellant to persuade us that the plea should be set 
  aside. On the record, that onus has not been met. We can therefore find no basis 
  for setting aside the plea of guilty, which was voluntary, unequivocal and informed. 
  </p>
<p>
  [21] The appeal against conviction is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  Sentence Appeal</p>
<p>
  [22] The appellant seeks to appeal sentence as well. He submits that a conditional 
  sentence was appropriate and that the trial judge erred in imposing a twelve-month 
  period of incarceration instead.</p>
<p>
  [23] We decline to give effect to that argument. The trial judge considered 
  all of the relevant factors, including the age of the appellant, his remorse, 
  his sexual immaturity, and the assessment that his risk of sexual re-offence 
  was low. He reviewed and applied the appropriate principles relating to conditional 
  sentences, as set out in R v. Proulx (2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449, and indeed, 
  he found that the appellant was eligible for a conditional sentence and met 
  the requirements. He concluded, however, that in the circumstances of this case 
  - having regard particularly to the young age of the complainant, the fact that 
  the appellant was in a position of trust in relation to her, and the duration 
  of the offences - a conditional sentence was not appropriate. </p>
<p>
  [24] On the record before him, it was open to the trial judge to opt in favour 
  of a custodial sentence. We find no error in principle in his having done so 
  and therefore, cannot interfere with the sentence imposed.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [25] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence 
  is granted, but the appeal as to sentence is dismissed as well.</p>
