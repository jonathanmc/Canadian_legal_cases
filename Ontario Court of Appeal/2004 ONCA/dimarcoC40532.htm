<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released orally: January 15, 2004</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal by the plaintiffs from the dismissal of a motion to extend 
  the time for the service of their statement of claim in respect to damages claimed 
  as a result of a motor vehicle accident.</p>
<p>[2] In dismissing the appellants' motion, the motion judge erred in law in 
  concluding that were she to grant the order greater prejudice would be sustained 
  by the defendants than by the plaintiffs should the order be refused. The prejudice 
  that the motion judge concluded the defendants would sustain was that they would 
  have to personally pay any damages awarded to the plaintiffs because the defendants' 
  motor vehicle insurance had been cancelled prior to the motor vehicle accident. 
</p>
<p>[3] The record is clear that the delay in serving the statement of claim had 
  nothing to do with the cancellation of the defendants' motor vehicle insurance. 
  Nor has the delay caused prejudice to the defendants in maintaining a defence 
  on the merits to the plaintiffs' claim. Thus, the prejudice relied on by the 
  motion judge was not caused by the plaintiffs' delay in serving the statement 
  of claim and did not provide a proper reason to deny the plaintiffs' motion.</p>
<p>[4] Therefore, the appeal is allowed. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the order of the 
  motion judge are set aside. In substitution, there will be an order extending 
  the time for service of the statement of claim to February 15, 2004. The appellants 
  will have their costs of the motion and the appeal, each fixed at $500 all inclusive.</p>
