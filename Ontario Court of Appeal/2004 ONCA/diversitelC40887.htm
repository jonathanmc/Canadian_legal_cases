<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] There was no dispute that the law to be applied in this case is as set 
  out in the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Sail Labrador Ltd. v. Challenge 
  One (The), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 265. The motions judge referred to this law and found 
  that time was of the essence in the contract. For the appellants to succeed 
  in this appeal they had to show a palpable and overriding error in her findings. 
  The appellant has not shown any such error.</p>
<p>[2] With respect to the fresh evidence, this is an attempt to produce the kind 
  of evidence that the motions judge did not consider was relevant. An attempt 
  to appeal that ruling was refused. In our view, the evidence, which is subject 
  to different interpretations, does not meet the test for fresh evidence. It 
  is not relevant. It does not take away from the motions judge's finding that 
  time was of the essence in this contract and therefore that there was a fundamental 
  breach of the contract. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly the appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
<p>Signed: &quot;R. Roy McMurtry CJO&quot;<br>
