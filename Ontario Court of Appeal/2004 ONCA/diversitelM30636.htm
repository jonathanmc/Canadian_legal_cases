<p>ARMSTRONG J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] This is a motion by the respondent in the appeal for: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) an order quashing that part of the appeal which relates 
  to a refusal to order the production of documents; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) an order requiring the appellant to post security for costs 
  of the proceedings in the Superior Court and of the appeal.</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant, Glacier Bay Inc., is a California company which entered into 
  a contract with the respondent, Diversitel Communications Inc., an Ontario company. 
  The contract was to supply panels for electronic equipment to be used in a broadcasting 
  system in the far north of Canada.</p>
<p>
  [3] Diversitel paid U.S.$40,000 in advance to Glacier Bay. A schedule called 
  for Glacier Bay to begin delivery in October 2002 and to be completed in February 
  2003. There is an issue as to whether time was of the essence in the contract.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant was not able to meet the delivery schedule due to problems 
  with its principal supplier. As a result, the respondent terminated the contract 
  on November 1, 2002 and subsequently commenced this action for the return of 
  its U.S.$40,000. </p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant brought a motion for production of documents related to the 
  contract which the respondent entered with its replacement supplier. The respondent 
  brought a cross-motion for summary judgment under Rule 76 of the Simplified 
  Rules. The motions judge gave judgment for the respondent and at the same time 
  dismissed the appellant's request for the production of documents and 
  dismissed the counter-claim. According to the motions judge, the appellant defended 
  the action on the basis that the respondent was not justified in terminating 
  the contract. Before us, the appellant submitted that it could have made up 
  the initial delay and completed delivery by February 2003. We are told that 
  the appellant also asserted a counter-claim against the respondent. However, 
  in the record before us, we were not supplied with copies of the pleadings. 
  The appellant has appealed the judgment against it, the dismissal of the counter-claim 
  and the refusal to order the production of documents. </p>
<p>
  The Production of Documents</p>
<p>
  [6] The decision of the motions judge refusing to order the production of documents 
  is clearly interlocutory and leave to appeal must be obtained from a judge of 
  the Divisional Court pursuant to s. 19(1)(b) of the Courts of Justice Act R.S.O. 
  1990, c. C.43 even though the appellant has a right of appeal to this court 
  on the judgment and the dismissal of the counter-claim. If the Divisional Court 
  grants leave then the appellant may bring a motion pursuant to s. 6(2) of the 
  Courts of Justice Act for an order directing that the productions issue be heard 
  with the appeal related to the judgment in the action and the dismissal of the 
  counter-claim. See Cole v. Hamilton (City) (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 284 at 289 (C.A.). 
  I would therefore quash that part of the appeal which relates to the productions 
  issue.</p>
<p>
  Security for Costs</p>
<p>
  [7] The respondent relies upon rules 61.06(1)(b) and 56.01(1)(d) of the Rules 
  of Civil Procedure in support of its motion for security for costs. The aforesaid 
  rules provide: </p>
<p class="indent"> 61.06 (1) In an appeal where it appears that,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) an order for security for costs could be made against the 
  appellant under rule 56.01;</p>
<p class="indent">a judge of the appellate court, on motion by the respondent, 
  may make such order for security for costs of the proceeding and of the appeal 
  as is just. </p>
<p class="indent">56.01 (1) The court, on motion by the defendant or res-pondent 
  in a proceeding, may make such order for security for costs as is just where 
  it appears that,</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the plaintiff or applicant is a corporation or a nominal 
  plaintiff or applicant, and there is good reason to believe that the plaintiff 
  or applicant has insufficient assets in Ontario to pay the costs of the defendant 
  or respondent;</p>
<p>
  [8] The first issue concerns whether the respondent in the appeal, who is the 
  plaintiff in the action is entitled to security of costs of the action and the 
  appeal from the judgment in the action. This court per Laskin J.A. has held 
  in GEAC Canada Ltd. v. Craig Erickson Systems Inc. (1994), 26 C.P.C. (3d) 355 
  (C.A.) that rule 61.06(1)(b) is confined to the making of an order against a 
  plaintiff/appellant: see also Toronto Dominion Bank v. Szilagyi Farms Ltd. (1988), 
  65 O.R. (2d) 433. Grange J.A. also held in Toys "R" Us (Canada) 
  Ltd. v. Rotisseries St-Hubert Ltee. (1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 814 (C.A.) that a plaintiff/respondent, 
  who moved for security for costs against a defendant/appellant, pursuant to 
  rule 61.06(1)(b) could not succeed since as the original defendant at trial, 
  it could not have been the object for security of costs at trial and therefore 
  cannot be the subject of such in an order on appeal. The policy rationale is 
  not to impose security for costs upon foreign or impecunious defendants who 
  are forced into court by others. </p>
<p>
  [9] There is a second issue. The appellant is a plaintiff by counter-claim and 
  arguably could have been subject to security for costs in regard to its counter-claim. 
  However, it is not every counter-claim which will impose upon the defendant/plaintiff 
  by counter-claim the obligation to post security for costs. For example, security 
  for costs will not be ordered where the counter-claim arises out of the same 
  transaction or circumstances as the claim and is in substance a defence to the 
  claim: see Macpherson v. Masini (1879), 5 Q.B.D. 144 and Wilkins v. Towner, 
  [1936] OWN 137.</p>
<p>
  [10] I conclude from the above analysis that the respondent is not entitled 
  to move for security for costs of the action and for the appeal from the judgment 
  in the action. The respondent, however, may be entitled to move for security 
  for costs in regard to the dismissal of the counter-claim and the appeal in 
  respect of the counter-claim. However, as indicated above, we have not been 
  provided with the pleadings in the record before us. There is nothing in the 
  record to suggest that the counterclaim does not arise out of the same transaction 
  as the claim advanced by the respondent/plaintiff. </p>
<p>
  [11] In the result, I would dismiss the motion for security for costs. </p>
<p>
  [12] While success has been divided, most of the time before us was taken up 
  by the motion for security for costs. I would therefore award the costs of the 
  motion before us to the appellant on a partial indemnity basis fixed in the 
  amount of $3,500 including Goods and Services Tax and disbursements.</p>
