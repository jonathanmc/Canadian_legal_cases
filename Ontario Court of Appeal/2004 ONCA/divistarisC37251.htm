<p>On appeal from a judgment of Justice Russell G. Juriansz of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, sitting with a jury, acquitting the respondent, dated October 16, 
  2001.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>
  [1] The charges in this case arose out of an incident on January 13, 2001, when 
  the respondent went to the complainant's store. At trial, the respondent and 
  the complainant told diametrically different versions of what happened at the 
  store and the events leading up to the incident. On October 16, 2001, after 
  a two week jury trial before Juriansz J., the respondent was acquitted on charges 
  of robbery with a firearm, forcible confinement, assault causing bodily harm, 
  extortion and possession of stolen property over $5,000 (cash). He was found 
  guilty of theft (a watch) (as an included offence to the robbery charge), possession 
  of stolen property over $5,000 (a watch), possession of a prohibited firearm 
  and possession of a prohibited device. The respondent spent nine months in pre-trial 
  custody and on October 18, 2001, was sentenced to one day in jail and twelve 
  months of probation. </p>
<p>
  [2] The Crown appeals against the acquittals on a question of law alone: that 
  the trial judge erred in law by charging the jury that evidence of the respondent's 
  prior consistent statement could be used by the jury for the truth of its contents. 
  The Crown submits further that it can meet its onus on a Crown appeal from acquittal 
  of showing that the jury verdict would likely have been different had the erroneous 
  instruction not been given: Section 686(4) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, 
  c. C-46.</p>
<p>
  [3] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal. Although there 
  was an error in law, the Crown has not met its onus for overturning a verdict 
  of acquittal.</p>
<p>
  FACTS </p>
<p>
  [4] The twenty-nine year old complainant, Catherine (Cathy) Cosburn, owned and 
  operated the "Funky Skunk," a store in a Scarborough strip mall that 
  sold items related to hemp and marijuana. The respondent, Alex Divitaris, was 
  twenty-two years old at trial and lived in close proximity to the Funky Skunk 
  with his mother and two brothers.</p>
<p>
  [5] The respondent completed the eleventh grade in school and has a substantial 
  criminal record consisting of seventeen entries dating back to 1994. It includes 
  convictions for theft, failure to comply, escape lawful custody, obstructing 
  an officer and failure to attend court. At trial, the record was put to him 
  and accepted as true in his examination-in-chief. </p>
<p>
  [6] After being in jail for approximately nine months, the respondent was released 
  in mid-August 2001 and began working at his brother's cleaning company three 
  to five days a week. The complainant knew the respondent as "Alex" 
  or "Diva". They had known each other for approximately four years 
  before the incident; however, they differed in their views of how well they 
  knew each other over the first three years of that time. </p>
<p>
  The Events at the Funky Skunk on January 13, 2001</p>
<p>
  [7] On the evening of January 13, 2001, the respondent went to the complainant's 
  store where a violent incident occurred that gave rise to this case. Those were 
  the only facts agreed to at trial; the complainant and the respondent each had 
  their own versions of how and why the incident occurred.</p>
<p>
  The Complainant's Version of the Events</p>
<p>
  [8] According to the complainant, as she was closing her store for the evening 
  at roughly six o'clock p.m. on January 13, 2001, the respondent entered. He 
  appeared very angry and took her keys, locking the door behind him. He pushed 
  her back and lifted up his jacket revealing a gun tucked in the top of his pants. 
  The respondent yelled at her and insisted that she owed him $15,000, because 
  she had caused him trouble by saying bad things about him. She insisted that 
  was impossible - she had been in the hospital for the previous two weeks and 
  had not spoken to anyone. </p>
<p>
  [9] After pulling the complainant by her hair to the back of the store, the 
  respondent began punching her, waving his gun around, throwing her into the 
  wall, yelling at her, and kicking her when she was down on the floor trying 
  to sit up. Then the respondent removed just under $1,300 from the complainant's 
  purse on the table beside her. This money was for a COD order she was expecting. 
  He also took her watch (which she was wearing at the time), her ring, her prescription, 
  and her driver's license. He told her to meet him the next day to give him more 
  money and threatened to hurt her family if she disclosed what had transpired. 
  He reminded her to meet him the next day and made her write it down so she would 
  not forget. At trial, the complainant identified a note seized from the store 
  as the one she made at the time. </p>
<p>
  [10] Eventually the complainant told the respondent that she would do what he 
  wanted - borrow the money and pay him - if he would just leave her alone. After 
  the respondent left, the complainant waited two or three minutes before driving 
  to her friend Gayle Mackenzie's house a few blocks away.</p>
<p>
  The Respondent's Version of the Events </p>
<p>
  [11] According to the respondent, at five o'clock p.m. on the day of the incident, 
  while he was out shopping with his girlfriend, Tahnee (Tanya) Foss-Liboiron, 
  for a birthday present for her daughter, he received a call on his cell phone 
  from the complainant. The respondent explained that the complainant owed him 
  money because she lost casino chips that he had given her to cash in for him, 
  and that she had persistently refused or been unable to pay him. His girlfriend 
  knew about the complainant; she was aware of the telephone calls he was receiving 
  from her and of the sexual encounter they had once had at a motel. </p>
<p>
  [12] On the phone the complainant asked the respondent to come to the store. 
  The respondent and his girlfriend took a cab over to the Funky Skunk; the respondent 
  thought the complainant was planning on paying him the money that she owed him. 
  Once they reached the store, the respondent went into the store and told his 
  girlfriend to wait in the cab. He quickly realized the complainant was high 
  on cocaine and unable to give him cash; instead, the complainant insisted that, 
  as collateral for the debt, he take an expensive watch, which she told him was 
  stolen. Annoyed, the respondent threw the complainant's bag of cocaine on the 
  floor. The enraged complainant then pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot 
  the respondent. </p>
<p>
  [13] The respondent struggled with her, shoving her into a wall at one point 
  and eventually disarming her. After taking the gun from the complainant, the 
  respondent left the store with the intention of getting rid of it. When the 
  respondent and his girlfriend arrived at her apartment, he waited for his girlfriend's 
  mother to leave and then told her what had happened, in the course of which 
  he showed her the gun. During the respondent's examination-in-chief, he testified 
  that he told his girlfriend what had occurred, although in his testimony he 
  did not give the contents of that conversation: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q: What happened after Tonya's mother left?</p>
<p class="indent">A: Um, she was all over me. She asked me - she asked me: "Well, 
  what happened?" And I told her what happened, basically. And as I was explaining 
  her the story I - I pulled out the gun and I showed it to her, and she kind 
  of freaked out; she was shocked when I showed it to her. And she was mad at 
  this girl. She doesn't really like this girl just from what I told her. And 
  she was just really upset at this girl, and she was upset at me with having 
  the gun.</p>
<p>
  [14] Shortly after their conversation, the respondent took the subway home to 
  his mother's apartment where he was arrested several hours later. The gun was 
  found under the sofa where the respondent was sleeping. Also discovered were 
  the watch and some cash ($740 all in twenty dollar bills).</p>
<p>
  The Complainant's Injuries</p>
<p>
  [15] When the complainant left the store after the incident, she went to her 
  friend Gayle Mackenzie's house. Ms. Mackenzie confirmed that the complainant 
  showed up at her door at around 7:30 p.m. on January 13, 2001. The complainant 
  was crying, her hair was a mess, her hands were swollen, she vomited, and she 
  had blood on her face. </p>
<p>
  [16] At around six o'clock a.m. the next day, the complainant went to the hospital. 
  She described herself as having a concussion, lots of bumps, bruising and swelling, 
  a broken nose, swollen eyes, a cut lip and nose, and cuts to her back. She testified 
  that her head was split from being hit with the gun and that there was a significant 
  amount of blood matted in her hair. The treating physician, Dr. Fonberg, testified 
  that he ordered a CAT scan and X-rays on the basis of the complainant's information. 
  According to the doctor, the complainant's injuries were not severe, but her 
  distress was understandable if she had in fact been threatened in the manner 
  reported.</p>
<p>
  Evidence Tendered in Support of Respondent's Version of Events</p>
<p>The Rental Car</p>
<p>
  [17] To support his position that the complainant owed him money, the respondent 
  testified that the complainant agreed to rent him a car as partial payment for 
  the debt. He recalled the date that she rented the car - October 23, 2000 - 
  because his younger brother found the rental agreement in their apartment. It 
  was in the course of renting the car that the respondent and complainant drove 
  to the motel and engaged in a brief sexual encounter.</p>
<p>
  Michael McCollum</p>
<p>
  [18] Mr. McCollum was in jail at the time of trial and had spoken to the respondent 
  on one occasion in the yard, although he testified that they did not discuss 
  the trial. Mr. McCollum acknowledged that he had dated the complainant, had 
  been arrested with her, and had an extensive criminal record. According to Mr. 
  McCollum, he had seen the complainant with a gun in her store; she had asked 
  him if he knew anywhere she could get nine-millimeter bullets. </p>
<p>
  Michael Sparkes</p>
<p>
  [19] Michael Sparkes testified that the complainant was a friend or acquaintance 
  whom he had known for about four years since she opened the store. He related 
  an incident from December 2000, when he told the complainant about a fight he 
  had been involved in. During the conversation, she said: "I wish I was 
  there, I would have capped their asses" or, "[y]ou should have run 
  into here I would have capped their asses." On the same day, a few minutes 
  later, the complainant gave Mr. Sparkes some marijuana and he asked her if she 
  kept a gun in the store; in response, she showed him a gun, which Mr. Sparkes 
  identified at trial. The complainant also asked Mr. Sparkes if he knew anyone 
  who could get bullets for her.</p>
<p>
  [20] Mr. Sparkes went to see the respondent in jail about a month and a half 
  after the respondent's arrest to ask him what happened. They talked about the 
  gun, and Mr. Sparkes realized that the complainant had pulled out the same gun 
  as the one he had seen her with in December 2000. Mr. Sparkes spoke to or visited 
  the respondent three times while the respondent was in jail awaiting trial. 
  He only revealed his information about the gun to the respondent's lawyer about 
  six months after his visits to the respondent in jail.</p>
<p>
  Prior Consistent Statement</p>
<p>
  [21] Crown counsel cross-examined Mr. Sparkes and suggested that he and the 
  respondent had "cobbled together" his version of events in jail, in 
  anticipation of testifying at the respondent's trial. The Crown's cross-examination 
  of Mr. McCollum also suggested that he and the respondent had spoken about their 
  evidence prior to trial, while in custody together. </p>
<p>
  [22] To rebut the Crown's suggestion that the respondent had recently fabricated 
  his version of events, the trial judge permitted the defence to lead evidence 
  of the respondent's prior consistent statement to Ms. Foss-Liboiron, the respondent's 
  girlfriend at the time of the incident. She testified that on the day of the 
  incident, when they returned home from the Funky Skunk, the respondent showed 
  her the gun and told her what had happened in the store. She recited essentially 
  the same story as that later provided by the respondent in the course of his 
  testimony: </p>
<p class="indent"> A: Um, I asked him what happened with Cathy, he said that he 
  - he went up to her store, and that she had - he had asked her if she had the 
  money for him, she said: No. Um, she started talking about some stolen jewellery, 
  saying that he could buy this jewellery and in return sell it. Alex said that 
  that pissed him off. Um, he said that - let me just think back. He said that 
  there was drugs on a table - or a counter. Um, he had said to her: If you don't 
  have the money to pay me, how do you have the money for drugs? Um, and which 
  in that time he threw the drugs on the floor.</p>
<p class="indent">Q: Okay. Did he tell you what kind of drugs they were?</p>
<p class="indent">A: It was cocaine.</p>
<p class="indent">Q: Did he tell you what happened after the drugs were thrown 
  on the floor?</p>
<p class="indent">A: Yes, he said that Cathy went to the floor to try to salvage 
  whatever drugs she could from the floor. Um, he said that she wasn't successful 
  with doing that and she got quite angry and started screaming at him.</p>
<p class="indent">Q: Did he tell you anything else that took place?</p>
<p class="indent">A: Yes, he told me that she pulled a gun on him&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q: Did he tell you what happened after she produced this firearm?</p>
<p class="indent"> A: Yes, he told me that he tackled her that he got the gun 
  from her.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q: Okay. Did he use the word "tackle," or is that your - </p>
<p class="indent"> A: No, that would be my word. He said there was a struggle, 
  and that he ended up with the gun.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q: Did he tell you anything about the struggle?</p>
<p class="indent"> A: Yes. He told me that he threw her into a wall, or up against 
  the wall.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> Q: Now, was there anything else in this conversation that he 
  told you?</p>
<p class="indent"> A: Yes. He told me that she had - she had produced a watch, 
  and she had asked him to take it for collateral.</p>
<p>
  [23] During his cross-examination of Ms. Foss-Liboiron, Crown counsel questioned 
  the witness as to how honest the respondent was with her: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q: So you don't think that Mr. Divitaris deceived you?</p>
<p class="indent">A: No, I don't.</p>
<p class="indent">Q: And the degree of honesty he showed to you, you're satisfied 
  with that degree of honesty?</p>
<p class="indent">A: Yes, I am.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Q: Would you be surprised if I suggest to you that, in fact, 
  - in fact, knowing that that watch, knowing in his mind that that watch was 
  the product of a robbery, nevertheless Alex took that watch with him and had 
  it in his pocket. Would that surprise you?</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: How is this relevant?</p>
<p class="indent">THE WITNESS: I don't understand the question.</p>
<p class="indent">CROWN COUNSEL: It's relevant, Your Honour, because it's yet 
  another instance of where Mr. Divitaris has seen fit to deceive this witness.</p>
<p class="indent">DEFENCE COUNSEL: I don't know that it's been established that 
  he did deceive the witness, Your Honour.</p>
<p class="indent">CROWN COUNSEL: He certainly deceived about his criminal record, 
  there is no doubt.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: Whether the witness would be surprised has slight 
  evidential value.</p>
<p class="indent">THE TRIAL JUDGE'S RULING </p>
<p>
  [24] Despite repeated objections from the Crown, the trial judge charged the 
  jury that they could use the evidence of the respondent's prior consistent statement 
  to Ms. Foss-Liboiron not only to rebut the allegation of recent fabrication, 
  but for the truth of its contents. The trial judge held that a prior statement 
  made by an accused was subject to a different rule than that of a witness. He 
  also stated that since the respondent's version of events at trial was basically 
  the same as the one he had given to Ms. Foss-Liboiron, the issue of the permissible 
  use of that evidence was "academic". </p>
<p>
  [25] The trial judge charged the jury, with respect to prior consistent statements, 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> What a witness said in an out-of-court statement is not admissible 
  for the truth of its contents unless the witness has adopted it as true at this 
  trial. An out-of-court prior statement may be admissible and may be used only 
  to help you assess the witness' credibility. In other words, where the witness 
  has made a prior consistent statement that consistency may be viewed as tending 
  to enhance the credibility of the witness. However, it is important to note 
  that the fact that the prior statement is consistent with the witness' testimony 
  at trial does not mean the prior statement is corroborative or confirmatory 
  of the truth of the witness' testimony at trial. This is because a deliberate 
  lie or even an honest mistake, if that's the case, does not become truthful 
  merely because it is repeated&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">A different rule applies to the accused. In this case, several 
  witnesses have testified about what they say Mr. Divitaris told them on an earlier 
  occasion. In the circumstances of this case, of course, the first thing you 
  have to decide is whether you accept the testimony that the accused did make 
  the previous out-of-court statements that some of the witnesses said he did. 
  If you decide that you accept this testimony or some of it, then what the accused 
  said in his out-of-court statements is admissible for two purposes. First, the 
  prior statement is admissible for the purpose of helping you assess the accused's 
  credibility. If you accept that he did make these statements at an earlier time 
  it may help you to decide whether his testimony at trial was or was not a recent 
  fabrication. It may affect his credibility depending on whether the particulars 
  in the early statement are consistent or inconsistent with his statement at 
  trial. Second, in the case of the accused a previous statement is also admissible 
  for the truth of its contents. In other words, if you accept that the accused 
  did make a previous out-of-court statement about the events you may consider 
  the content of that statement to help you decide what happened, what the facts 
  are in this case. Thus, the prior statement is admissible for or against the 
  accused on the issue of whether the Crown has proved his guilt beyond a reasonable 
  doubt.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [26] The Crown appeals the respondent's acquittals under s. 686 of the Criminal 
  Code, on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in instructing the jury 
  that they were entitled to use the accused's statement to his girlfriend of 
  what transpired in the Funky Skunk for the truth of its contents.</p>
<p>
  [27] The respondent submits that the trial judge made no error of law in his 
  instruction, but that if he did, the Crown has not met its onus when appealing 
  from an acquittal, as required by the Supreme Court in R. v. Vezeau, [1977] 
  2 S.C.R. 277, to show that the jury verdicts would likely have been different 
  had the error not been made.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>Prior Consistent Statement </p>
<p>
  [28] A prior consistent statement is normally not admissible because it is viewed 
  as a form of self-serving evidence. It is considered (a) unhelpful because it 
  adds nothing new to the evidence, and (b) potentially dangerous, because it 
  may mislead the trier of fact into thinking that because a person said the same 
  thing on more than one occasion, it is more likely to be true. On the contrary, 
  a concocted statement, repeated on more than one occasion, remains concocted: 
  See John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman &amp; Alan W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence 
  in Canada, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1999) c. 7 at 313.</p>
<p>
  [29] However, as with most exclusionary rules, where there are circumstances 
  that make a prior consistent statement relevant, it can be admissible for a 
  limited purpose: See e.g. R. v. Demetrius (2003), 176 O.A.C. 349.</p>
<p>
  [30] One such circumstance is to rebut an allegation of recent fabrication. 
  In that case, the purpose of allowing evidence of the prior consistent statement 
  is to demonstrate that the statement was not recently fabricated because the 
  person made a similar statement at a time before the impugned recent statement. 
  For that purpose, it is still not admissible for the truth of its contents, 
  but to rebut the allegation of recent fabrication and to assess the credibility 
  of the person who made the impugned statement: The Law of Evidence in Canada, 
  at 319. This applies equally to a witness and to the accused: R. v. Rosik (1970), 
  2 C.C.C. (2d) 351 (Ont. C.A.). </p>
<p> [31] Because the jury is only entitled to make limited use of a prior consistent 
  statement, where the statement is admitted, the trial judge is required to include 
  in the charge to the jury a limiting instruction explaining that the prior statement 
  is not evidence of the facts it relates but may only be used to assist in determining 
  the credibility of the impugned statement and its maker.. Rosik<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a>, 
  R. v. A.(J.) 112 C.C.C. (3d) 528 at 536 (Ont. C.A.), R. v. Wait (1994), 69 O.A.C. 
  63 at paras. 4-5.</p>
<p>
  [32] The reason that the repetition of a statement becomes probative of the 
  credibility of its maker, when according to the original rule, repetition of 
  a statement does not make it more likely to be true, can be explained by the 
  timing of the prior statement. When the prior consistent statement was made 
  at a time before the person who made it would have had a reason to concoct the 
  statement, the prior statement has some indicia of reliability.</p>
<p> [33] For example, in Rosik,<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> the accused 
  did not testify but gave statements to the police that were admitted into evidence. 
  In one of those statements, he said that he had ingested drugs before the shooting. 
  Jessup J.A. (with whom Gale C.J.O. concurred on this point) was satisfied that 
  an imputation of recent contrivance was implicit in the Crown's conduct of the 
  trial. He therefore would have allowed the accused's wife and two others to 
  give evidence that the accused told them before the crime that he had injested 
  the drugs. The evidence would be admitted with an instruction from the trial 
  judge that "such evidence was not evidence of the fact of the injestion of drugs, 
  but was simply consistent with what the accused said in his statement to the 
  police and should be considered for the sole purpose of deciding the truth of 
  that part of the statement" (p. 390).</p>
<p>
  [34] This instruction appears to contradict the premise for the rule that excludes 
  prior consistent statements - that repetition does not make the statement more 
  likely to be true. However, because the prior statement was made at a time when 
  there was no motive to fabricate, the likelihood that the prior statement was 
  true, together with the consistency of the statements, could make the prior 
  statement probative of the veracity of the second statement.</p>
<p>
  [35] However, when the prior consistent statement is made after the crime, when 
  arguably there was a motive to fabricate, it is as unlikely to be true as the 
  statement that the Crown impugns as a recent fabrication. That was what occurred 
  in this case.</p>
<p>
  [36] In R. v. Campbell (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 6, Martin J. A expressed the view 
  that the exception regarding the admissibility of previous statements to rebut 
  an allegation of recent fabrication can be difficult to apply. However, in explaining 
  the concept, the examples he refers to all describe situations where the prior 
  statement was made at a time before there was a motive or opportunity to fabricate 
  (p.19-20).</p>
<p>
  [37] In this case, the issue arose through the Crown's suggestion to the defence 
  witness, Mr. Sparkes, that he and the accused had cobbled together the story 
  that the gun belonged to the complainant when Mr. Sparkes visited the accused 
  in jail, i.e., the Crown suggested that the story was recently fabricated. Once 
  that suggestion was made, defence counsel sought to lead from the witness Ms. 
  Foss-Liboiron, the accused's girlfriend who was with him that day, waiting for 
  him in a taxi, what the accused told her after they returned to her mother's 
  apartment about what had transpired in the Funky Skunk. Ms. Foss-Liboiron was 
  permitted to recount the accused's version of the story. Although Crown counsel 
  at trial conceded that he had suggested recent fabrication, he took the firm 
  position with the trial judge that the jury had to be given a limiting instruction 
  as to the purpose of the evidence of the prior consistent statement and the 
  use that could be made of it.</p>
<p>
  [38] The trial judge rejected this submission. In his charge to the jury, the 
  trial judge told them that where a prior consistent statement is made by an 
  accused, as opposed to another witness, the statement is admitted into evidence 
  for the truth of its contents.</p>
<p>
  [39] In his questioning of the witness, Ms. Foss-Liboiron, and in his address 
  to the jury, Crown counsel suggested that the accused was lying to Ms. Foss-Liboiron 
  and that she had no independent knowledge of whether the facts were true other 
  than what the accused had told her. The respondent on the appeal submits that 
  because the Crown put the truth of the statement in issue, the jury was entitled 
  to use it either for or against the accused, depending on whether they believed 
  it was true or not. The respondent says that the trial judge was therefore correct 
  in this case, that the accused's statement to Ms. Foss-Liboiron could be used 
  by the jury for the truth of its content.</p>
<p>
  [40] In my view this analysis is flawed. The trial judge erred by instructing 
  the jury that they could use a prior consistent statement by the accused for 
  the truth of its contents. The statement was tendered to rebut the Crown's suggestion 
  that some time after the event, Mr. Sparkes and the accused concocted the story 
  that the gun found in the accused's apartment belonged to the complainant. Although 
  the Crown concedes that the evidence was admissible for that purpose, it is 
  clear that the evidence would not bolster Mr. Sparkes' credibility; rather, 
  it seems to have been agreed that because it was alleged that Mr. Sparkes and 
  the accused concocted the story together, the accused's prior statement to his 
  girlfriend could be led to rebut the allegation that the accused concocted the 
  story with Mr. Sparkes.</p>
<p>
  [41] However, because the accused told his girlfriend the story following the 
  events of the alleged crimes, when he already had a reason to fabricate, there 
  is no basis to conclude that the statement was likely true. In other words, 
  one of the reasons why prior consistent statements are considered non-probative 
  applies here. In these circumstances, unlike in Rosik, there was no reason for 
  the jury to consider the consistency of the statements, taken alone, as probative 
  of the truth of the impugned evidence.</p>
<p>
  [42] Therefore, even the instruction suggested in Rosik that the jury could 
  use the prior statement, not for its truth but to assess the credibility of 
  the accused's version of what occurred, would not have been appropriate in this 
  case. The most the jury could do with the accused's prior statement to his girfriend, 
  if they accepted that it was made (or had a reasonable doubt about it) was to 
  use it to rebut the allegation that the accused concocted the story about the 
  gun with Sparkes, i.e. to rebut the allegation of recent fabrication with Sparkes, 
  and in that context, to use the consistency of his statements as a factor in 
  assessing his credibility.</p>
<p>
  The Vezeau Test</p>
<p>
  [43] Where the Crown appeals against an acquittal on a question of law, in order 
  to set aside the verdict, the court must be satisfied that without the error, 
  "the verdict would not necessarily have been the same". Vezeau, supra, 
  at 292. The Supreme Court has emphasized that the Crown's onus is a heavy one: 
  R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345 at para. 80. See also R. v. MacKenzie, [1993] 
  1 S.C.R. 212 at 217.</p>
<p> [44] The Crown submits that it has met the onus on the following analysis: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the case turned on credibility; </li>
  <li>the trial judge told the jury: "The case for the defence also depends entirely 
    on the credibility of Mr. Divitaris, and his witnesses"; </li>
  <li>in his jury address, defence counsel suggested that Ms. Foss-Liboiron was 
    perhaps the most important witness after the accused;</li>
  <li>because the trial judge misdirected the jury as to how to approach her evidence, 
    it is logical that the jury misused her evidence;</li>
  <li>consequently, with a proper instruction, the jury's verdict would not necessarily 
    have been the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [45] I do not accept this submission for four reasons. First, while it is true 
  that the case turned on the credibility of the complainant and of the accused, 
  the verdicts demonstrated that the jury did not accept all of the evidence of 
  either of them. The jury acquitted the appellant on the armed robbery and assault 
  causing bodily harm charges, but convicted him of theft of the complainant's 
  watch. </p>
<p>
  [46] His story was that the complainant had asked him to take the watch as collateral 
  against the money she owed him. Her story was that he took it from her. From 
  the verdict, although the jury had a reasonable doubt about everything else 
  that occurred during the encounter, they were satisfied beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that the accused was not telling the truth about the watch. This is particularly 
  significant because in her evidence, Ms. Foss-Liboiron said that the accused 
  told her that Ms. Cosborn offered the watch to him as collateral. The jury must 
  have rejected this fact as untrue.</p>
<p>
  [47] Second, there were several apparent discrepancies in the evidence given 
  by the complainant, particularly in respect of the rental car and regarding 
  the extent of her injuries. These problems weakened the Crown's case.</p>
<p>
  [48] Third, the respondent's credibility was the main focus of Crown counsel's 
  address to the jury. Crown counsel made it clear to the jury in his address 
  that because Ms. Foss-Liboiron was not present during the encounter between 
  the accused and the complainant, she did not know what happened other than what 
  the accused had told her. Crown counsel's position was that the accused was 
  not telling the truth and that his repetition of the story to his girlfriend 
  after the fact did not add anything new to the story. He also cross-examined 
  Ms. Foss-Liboiron on the accused's lack of candour to her, again emphasizing 
  that it was the accused's credibility that was in issue. Furthermore, in his 
  closing to the jury, counsel for the accused agreed, when discussing Ms. Foss-Liboiron's 
  credibility, that she had no independent knowledge of what happened in the store 
  that night. Therefore, it was emphasized to the jury that they needed to look 
  at the accused's credibility on the issue of what occurred.</p>
<p>
  [49] Fourth, in response to the Crown's objection to the judge's charge regarding 
  the instruction on the prior consistent statement, the trial judge declined 
  to reconsider his previous ruling on the basis that he did not think the matter 
  was important in this case. I agree with respondent's submission that the trial 
  judge was in a good position to assess the significance of this aspect of the 
  evidence in the context of the entire record before the jury. In any event, 
  I agree with the trial judge's observation. The instruction that Crown counsel 
  was seeking was in accordance with the instruction proposed by Jessup J.A. in 
  Rosik, where the trial judge would have told the jury that they could use the 
  evidence to assess the credibility of the accused's version of the events. As 
  discussed above, in my view that instruction would not have been appropriate 
  here where the prior consistent statement was made after the event and had no 
  enhanced indicia of reliability. All that was appropriate was that the jury 
  could use the prior statement to rebut the allegation of recent fabrication 
  with Sparkes, and in that context, to consider the consistency of his statements 
  in their assessment of his credibility. However, had the trial judge given the 
  instruction requested by the Crown, it would have been very similar in meaning 
  and effect to what the jury was actually told, since Ms. Foss-Liboiron recounted 
  a version of the event that the respondent told her that was almost identical 
  to the version presented in the respondent's testimony.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [50] Although an error of law was made, this is not a case where the Crown has 
  met its burden to show that without the error, the verdict of the jury would 
  likely have been different. The appeal is therefore dismissed. </p>

<p><a name="a"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> In Demetrius, this court noted that there 
  are exceptions to this requirement. However, those exceptions are not relevant 
  in this case. The exceptions apply, for example, when it is clear that the statement 
  was not offered for the truth of its contents, or where the statement is from 
  a complainant (Crown witness)and the accused relies on the contents of the statement</p>
<p><a href="#2">[2]</a> Another example is found in this court&#146;s decision 
  in R. v. Edgar (2000), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 401 at paras. 38-39, where defence counsel&#146;s 
  argument in support of admitting a prior utterance by the accused was that he 
  made it at a time when he could not have known certain details of what other 
  witnesses would say about the events of the crime. The court upheld the trial 
  judge&#146;s refusal to admit the utterances, noting that defence counsel&#146;s 
  rationale for admitting the statement did not bear scrutiny and that the utterances 
  did not contain details that would suggest the accused was not in a position 
  to make a self-serving statement at the time.</p>
