<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>Rosenberg and Armstrong JJ.A.:</p>
<p>[1] In our view this appeal must be allowed. The appeal court judge found that 
  the trial judge erred in law in anlayzing the evidence in a piecemeal way. </p>
<p>[2] In our view that is not an accurate characterization of the trial judge's 
  reasons. The experienced trial judge looked at all of the alleged indicia of 
  impairment and considered the totality of the evidence. He found that he could 
  not rely on the conclusory statements of the officer. That was his decision 
  to make and does not represent an error of law. Especially with respect to the 
  driving, while the driving was bad it was open to the trial judge to find that 
  the driving as described by the officer gave no insight into whether the appellant 
  was impaired. Again this was a matter for the trial judge. </p>
<p>[3] The trial judge was also entitled to take into account the other evidence, 
  including the video tape. The officer acknowledged that the Crown's position 
  had not changed from the time of the arrest and the time of the videotaping 
  and he found that it did not show any indicia of impairment. It cannot be said 
  that the trial judge's decision that the officer did not have on an objective 
  basis reasonable grounds to make the demand was unreasonable. The appellate 
  court judge erred in law in substituting his opinion over that of the trial 
  judge. </p>
<p>[4] As to the application of s. 24(2) of the Charter it does not appear that 
  this was raised by the Crown before the summary conviction appeal court judge. 
  In the circumstances, this is not an appropriate case to reconsider the impact 
  of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in R. v. Stillman (1997), 113 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 321 and R. v. Feeney, (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 129 and the conscriptive 
  evidence in light of this court's subsequent decision in R. v. Richfield (2003), 
  178 C.C.C. (3d) 23. </p>
<p>[5] In any event, the trial judge considered the other Collins factors, not 
  just the fairness at trial. He found that this was a serious violation and that 
  the effect on the repute of the administration of justice would be more adversely 
  affected if the evidence was admitted. That was not an unreasonable conclusion. 
  Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and an acquittal 
  is entered.</p>
<p>Signed: &quot;Marc Rosenberg J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Robert P. Armstrong J.A.&quot;</p>
<p>Gillese JA (Dissenting):</p>
<p>[6] I come to a different conclusion and would have dismissed the appeal. </p>
<p>[7] The appeal court judge, in my view, correctly concluded that the trial 
  judge failed to appreciate the cumulative effect of the evidence which included 
  detailed explanations of bad driving; the appellant's admission of consumption 
  of alcohol; the smell of alcohol on the appellant's breath; glossy, bloodshot 
  eyes; somewhat slurred speech and the appellant being slightly unsteady on his 
  feet. Moreover, as the appeal court judge noted, the trial judge accepted the 
  evidence of the arresting officer concerning what he observed before he made 
  the demand. The trial judge stated that the officer was a &quot;completely credible 
  witness&quot; and that &quot;he is an honest, truthful witness&quot;.</p>
<p>[8] Accordingly, in my view, the appeal court judge's intervention was warranted 
  and I would have dismissed the appeal.</p>
