<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Roland J. Haines of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting without a jury, on January 29, 2003 and from the sentence 
  imposed on April 24, 2003.</p>
<p>CHARRON J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of impaired driving causing death and breach 
  of recognizance. He was sentenced to 12 months&#146; imprisonment on the driving 
  charge and one month consecutive on the breach of recognizance. He appeals against 
  both conviction and sentence in respect of the charge of impaired driving causing 
  death. </p>
<p>[2] The charge arose out of a single motor vehicle accident that occurred early 
  in the morning of June 11, 2000. The appellant and the deceased, Mark Doxtator, 
  were both in the vehicle at the time of the accident. The only issue at trial 
  was whether the appellant had been driving at the time the vehicle left the 
  road and rolled over in the ditch. When the accident was discovered, the appellant 
  was still in the vehicle. Mark Doxtator had been expelled from the vehicle and 
  his body was found in the ditch.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant submits that the verdict was unreasonable. The main thrust 
  of the appellant&#146;s argument was that the trial judge erred in failing to 
  give effect to the evidence of the expert accident reconstructionist called 
  by the defence. It was that expert&#146;s opinion that the appellant was likely 
  in the back seat of the vehicle and not in the driver&#146;s seat when the vehicle 
  left the road. Despite the fact that the trial judge found the expert &#147;credible&#148; 
  and his testimony &#147;helpful&#148;, he was satisfied beyond a reasonable 
  doubt on the whole of the evidence that the appellant was the driver. The appellant 
  submits that this conclusion was unreasonable.</p>
<p>[4] We did not call upon Crown counsel to respond to this argument. In our 
  view, the verdict was amply supported by the evidence. In particular, we note 
  the following items of evidence: </p>
<ul>
  <li>One witness, David Antone, testified that shortly before the accident he 
    had encountered the appellant and Mark Doxtator. At that time, the appellant 
    was driving his vehicle and Mark Doxtator was &#147;passed out&#148; in the 
    front passenger seat. Although Mr. Antone agreed in cross-examination that 
    Mark Doxtator had awakened at one point and talked, he disagreed with the 
    suggestion that Mark Doxtator had seemed more awake by the end of the conversation. 
  </li>
  <li>The Crown&#146;s expert accident reconstructionist was of the opinion that 
    the appellant had been the driver at the time the vehicle went into the ditch 
    and the trial judge accepted the facts underpinning this opinion. </li>
  <li>The defence expert conceded that, if the two occupants were in the front 
    seat at the time of the accident, it was likely that the appellant was the 
    driver and Mark Doxtator, the passenger.</li>
  <li>The physical evidence showed that the driver&#146;s head had likely hit 
    the windshield. Both experts agreed that the head injuries suffered by the 
    appellant were consistent with hitting the windshield.</li>
  <li>The trial judge rejected the appellant&#146;s testimony.</li></ul>
<p>[5] For these reasons, we dismissed the appeal against conviction and called 
      upon the Crown only on the sentence appeal. </p>
    <p>[6] Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing 
      to impose a conditional sentence, having regard more particularly to the 
      fact that the appellant is an aboriginal offender. Counsel relies on the 
      principles set out in R. v. Gladue, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688. She also relies 
      heavily on this court&#146;s decision in R. v. Logan (1999), 139 C.C.C. 
      (3d) 57 (Ont. C.A.) where, having regard to the &#147;very unique circumstances&#148; 
      of the case, this court substituted a sentence of 30 months&#146; imprisonment 
      with a 20-month conditional sentence in respect of charges of impaired driving 
      causing death and impaired driving causing bodily harm. </p>
    
<p>[7] Counsel for the appellant submits that there are so many parallels between 
  this case and the circumstances of the offender in Logan that the trial judge 
  erred in reaching a different conclusion. In particular, she notes the following 
  facts, all accepted by the trial judge: 
<ul>
  <li>the appellant&#146;s good work history;</li>
  <li>his responsible contribution to his community, including having previously 
    been Chief of the Oneida Nation of the Thames for two years; </li>
  <li>his participation in the National Native Alcohol and Drug Awareness Programme, 
    both before and since the incident;</li>
  <li>his helpfulness in the community with both youth and elders; </li>
  <li>the continuing support of family, friends, and community as evidenced in 
    letters filed at the sentencing; </li>
  <li>the limited significance of his dated conviction for drinking and driving 
    in 1986; </li>
  <li>his abstinence from alcohol record for a number of years before the accident 
    and since the accident; and</li>
  <li>his responsibility to his spouse and to his children.</li></ul> 
<p>[8] Crown counsel submits that the trial judge&#146;s reasons for sentence 
      do not reflect an error in principle. Counsel argues that both Gladue and 
      Logan were submitted to the sentencing judge and that there were sound reasons 
      to depart from the result in Logan in this case. </p>
    
<p>[9] In particular, this accused&#146;s circumstances demonstrated the following: 
<ul>
  <li>the extremely high level of blood alcohol content (256 mg), which appears 
    to have been the only reason for the accident; </li>
  <li>the appellant&#146;s prior conviction for drinking and driving which, although 
    dated, should have signalled to the appellant the potentially devastating 
    consequences of impaired driving; </li>
  <li>the appellant&#146;s decision to drink and drive notwithstanding his ongoing 
    involvement in the Native Alcohol and Drug Awareness programme at the time 
    of the accident;</li>
  <li>the appellant&#146;s driving for social reasons subsequent to the offence 
    contrary to a condition of his recognizance; </li>
  <li>the fact that no restorative programme was available to him in the aboriginal 
    community; </li>
  <li>and finally, the appellant&#146;s failure to make efforts to reconcile with 
    the members of the victim&#146;s (his cousin&#146;s) family or to assist them, 
    causing them much pain and anguish, as evidenced in their victim impact statements. </li></ul> 
    <p>[10] Finally, Crown counsel submits that it is apparent from the quantum 
      of sentence that the trial judge properly took into account the aboriginal 
      background of the offender. </p>
    <p>[11] Having regard to all the circumstances, we are not satisfied that 
      the sentence was demonstrably unfit as contended. Leave to appeal the sentence 
      is granted but the appeal is dismissed. </p>
