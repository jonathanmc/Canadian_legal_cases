<p>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Justice Robert A. Blair R.S.J., 
  Justice Maria T. Linhares de Sousa and Justice Denis J. Power) dated October 
  4, 2002, reasons for judgment reported at (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 746.</p>
<p>
  ROSENBERG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This appeal from an order of the Divisional Court concerns the right of 
  a plaintiff to disclosure and production of documents in the possession of the 
  defendant that the defendant obtained as a result of the disclosure process 
  in criminal proceedings brought against the defendant. In this case, the plaintiff 
  was particularly interested in production of statements that the defendant had 
  given to the police, and that the trial judge in the criminal proceedings had 
  held were obtained in violation of the defendant's rights under the Canadian 
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms and had excluded. Blair R.S.J., writing for the 
  unanimous court, held that the defendant was required to disclose the existence 
  of the Crown brief in his affidavits of documents. The defendant was, however, 
  only required to produce the contents of the brief either after the Superior 
  Court of Justice had screened them at a hearing of which the Attorney General 
  and the relevant police service were entitled to notice, or if the police, the 
  Attorney General and the parties consented to the production. The Divisional 
  Court also held that the defendant was not required to produce the statements 
  he gave to the police.</p>
<p>
  [2] For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal in part. While I largely 
  agree with the screening mechanism proposed by the Divisional Court, in my view, 
  that court erred in holding that the defendant's statements to the police should 
  not be produced. </p>
<p>
  [3] The Attorney General of Ontario and two police services intervened on this 
  appeal because of concerns with some aspects of the screening mechanism. At 
  the conclusion of these reasons, I will make some comments with respect to the 
  impact of the decision on both Crown disclosure practice and the application 
  of the screening process to materials used by the police in defending civil 
  actions, which materials were created during the criminal investigation.</p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [4] The defendant, Dr. Wagg, was an obstetrician and gynaecologist practicing 
  in the Town of Collingwood. He is now retired. On October 5, 1995, the plaintiff 
  attended at the defendant's office for an examination because of a vaginal infection. 
  She alleges that the defendant sexually assaulted her during that examination. 
  She reported the incident to the police. The police conducted an investigation 
  and took statements from the defendant and the plaintiff. The plaintiff believes 
  that the defendant's statements to the police would confirm her allegations. 
  The defendant was eventually charged with sexual assault.</p>
<p>
  [5] At trial, the Crown sought to tender the defendant's statements to the police. 
  The trial judge, a judge of the Ontario Court of Justice, held that the police 
  had violated the defendant's right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter. 
  He held that the statements should be excluded from evidence at the trial under 
  s. 24(2) of the Charter. The Attorney General has filed the transcript of the 
  trial judge's rulings with respect to ss. 10(b) and 24(2). I will refer to those 
  transcripts later in these reasons.</p>
<p>
  [6] The plaintiff was granted standing at the criminal trial for the purpose 
  of resisting a defence motion for production of her psychiatric record. In the 
  criminal proceedings, the plaintiff also sought access to the Crown brief. The 
  trial judge refused that application. The plaintiff unsuccessfully appealed 
  that decision. In the end, the trial judge stayed the proceedings because of 
  unreasonable delay.</p>
<p>
  [7] In 1998, the plaintiff began a civil action against the defendant alleging 
  that she was sexually assaulted by him in the course of a medical examination.</p>
<p>
  THE HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>
  [8] When the defendant refused to produce the contents of the Crown brief, the 
  plaintiff moved to compel production. The Master refused to order production. 
  He held that the contents of the Crown brief were not relevant. The defendant 
  no longer takes the position that the contents of the brief are irrelevant. 
  </p>
<p>
  [9] The plaintiff appealed that ruling and Juriansz J. ordered disclosure and 
  production of the Crown brief, including the defendant's statements to the police. 
  He held that assuming there was an implied undertaking by the defendant in the 
  criminal proceedings not to use the documents in the Crown brief for another 
  purpose, this did not excuse the defendant from complying with rule 30.02 of 
  the Rules of Civil Procedure and identifying the Crown brief in his affidavit 
  of documents as material that he objected to producing. He also held that the 
  defendant had not established any basis for refusing production of the documents. 
  In the opinion of Juriansz J., in this case the documents were not sought for 
  the purpose of launching new proceedings, which purpose would have been ulterior 
  or collateral and would therefore have brought the implied undertaking rule 
  into effect. In the alternative, he held that if an implied undertaking existed, 
  it was open to the court to vary that undertaking to allow production of the 
  documents. As to the defendant's statements, Juriansz J. held that s. 10 of 
  the Charter has no application to civil proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [10] MacFarland J. granted the defendant leave to appeal to the Divisional Court, 
  which decision is reported at [2001] O.J. No. 3082. In granting leave, she wrote 
  at para. 1 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Serious policy and public interests are at stake. While I have some reservation 
  that the facts of this case may be no different than the facts in Lang v. Crowe, 
  [2000] O.J. No. 653, when the same firm represented the Defendant in both the 
  criminal and civil proceedings and has access to the Crown Brief where the plaintiff 
  does not, I am told that defense counsel is prepared in this case to undertake 
  not to use the Crown Brief for any purpose.</p>
<p>
  [11] Later in these reasons I will discuss the decision in Lang v. Crowe, which 
  MacFarland J. mentions.</p>
<p>
  [12] The Divisional Court allowed the appeal and held, as I have indicated, 
  that the existence of the Crown brief had to be disclosed but that production 
  would be subject to a screening process by a judge of the Superior Court of 
  Justice. However, the Court held that the defendant's statement was not subject 
  to production. The reasons of the Divisional Court can be summarized as follows.</p>
<p>
  (i) Disclosure</p>
<p>
  [13] The Divisional Court agreed with Juriansz J. that the existence of the 
  Crown brief should be disclosed in accordance with rule 30.02. The defendant 
  has not cross-appealed this part of the ruling and has served an amended affidavit 
  of documents (albeit unsigned at the time of the hearing) that includes the 
  index to the Crown brief.</p>
<p>
  (ii) Production</p>
<p> [14] The Divisional Court disagreed with Juriansz J. that the Crown brief 
  must be produced to the plaintiff merely because the contents are relevant. 
  Rather, production should not be compelled until the appropriate state agencies 
  have "been given an opportunity to assess the public interest consequences involved 
  and either a Court order or the consent of the state and all parties is obtained" 
  (para. 19). The court pointed out that there could be a myriad of documents 
  and other material in the Crown brief that might be subject to privacy and other 
  interests that the parties to the civil action will not necessarily have an 
  interest in protecting. The court noted the concerns expressed in the Report 
  of the Attorney General's Advisory Committee on Charges, Screening, Disclosure, 
  and Resolution Discussions (the "Martin Report")<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
  about "the dangers of unwarranted dissemination of Crown disclosure documents" 
  (para. 25). Thus, there needed to be some screening mechanism by the appropriate 
  state agency or the court before the contents of the Crown brief were produced.</p>
<p> [15] The Divisional Court rejected the position of the defendant that the 
  implied undertaking rule precluded production of the Crown brief to the plaintiff. 
  I will discuss the implied undertaking rule further in my reasons. Suffice it 
  to say at this stage that the Divisional Court found, at para. 41, that while 
  there is an implied undertaking which binds Dr. Wagg from using any documents 
  produced to him in the criminal proceedings for any purposes collateral to the 
  criminal proceedings &#133; that implied undertaking has no application because 
  Dr. Wagg is not seeking to use the Crown productions against the Crown or anyone 
  else (including the plaintiff/complainant).</p>
<p>
  [16] More importantly, the implied undertaking rules would not adequately protect 
  the public interest that may exist in prohibiting wider dissemination of Crown 
  disclosure documents in particular circumstances. Thus, while the plaintiff 
  would be precluded by the implied undertaking rule from using the documents 
  produced to her for any purpose collateral to the present civil action, if a 
  document from the brief were made an exhibit at trial it would then be in the 
  public domain (para. 43).</p>
<p> [17] The Divisional Court then explained how the screening mechanism would 
  operate. Since I agree entirely with this part of the court's reasons, I intend 
  to summarize this part of the reasons at some length: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the party in possession or control of the Crown brief must disclose its 
    existence in the party's affidavit of documents and describe in general terms 
    the nature of its contents;</li>
  <li>the party should object to produce the documents in the Crown brief until 
    the appropriate state authorities have been notified, namely the Attorney 
    General and the relevant police service, and either those agencies and the 
    parties have consented to production, or on notice to the Attorney General 
    and the police service and the parties, the Superior Court of Justice has 
    determined whether any or all of the contents should be produced;</li>
  <li>the judge hearing the motion for production will consider whether some of 
    the documents are subject to privilege or public interest immunity and generally 
    whether "there is a prevailing social value and public interest in non-disclosure 
    in the particular case that overrides the public interest in promoting the 
    administration of justice through full access of litigants to relevant information" 
    (para. 51).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  (iii) The statements</p>
<p>
  [18] The Divisional Court made clear that it was primarily concerned with setting 
  out the screening mechanism and was not intending to determine whether any of 
  the documents in the Crown brief should actually be produced. However, with 
  respect to the defendant's statements to the police, a decision could be made 
  at this juncture in view of the finding by the trial judge in the criminal proceedings 
  that the statements should be excluded because of the Charter breach. The court 
  disagreed with Juriansz J., who had held that the statements were not protected 
  from production. While the Charter does not apply to strictly private litigation, 
  the common law is informed by Charter values "whenever one party to a civil 
  suit invokes or relies upon government action to produce what amounts to the 
  infringement of another party's Charter rights" (para. 66). In this case, 
  the plaintiff relied upon the Rules of Civil Procedure to compel production. 
  The Rules are a regulation and have the force of a statute and thus the plaintiff 
  is relying upon a rule of the state to "coerce production from another 
  party of state conscripted, unconstitutionally obtained evidence to be used 
  against the party whose Charter rights have been violated" (para. 66).</p>
<p>
  [19] The court considered that a violation of the defendant's s. 10(b) right 
  to counsel is not a trivial occurrence. The violation led to the exclusion of 
  the statement in the criminal proceedings and while there is a distinction between 
  civil and criminal cases, Charter values "apply equally at this stage of 
  the proceedings with respect to the contaminated statement of Dr. Wagg, in the 
  circumstances of this case" (para. 68). Requiring the defendant to produce 
  his statement would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. </p>
<p>
  [20] The court went on to consider whether there were any common law rules that 
  would require a different result. The court accepted that neither res judicata 
  nor estoppel strictly applied since the plaintiff was not a full party to the 
  criminal proceedings. However, it was "neither appropriate nor essential 
  that the issue be re-litigated in the civil proceedings". The court took 
  the view that the issue of whether the defendant's statement was taken in violation 
  of the Charter was not a question in which the plaintiff had a legitimate interest. 
  Rather it was a matter between the defendant and the state that had been resolved 
  by a court decision. The court held that "[A] statement cannot be taken 
  contrary to the Charter for criminal purposes but not contrary to the Charter 
  for civil purposes." (para. 78.)</p>
<p>
  [21] Accordingly, at paras. 81 and 82, the Divisional Court allowed the appeal 
  in part as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> The [defendant] is directed to disclose the existence of the 
  Crown Brief in Schedule "A" of his affidavit of documents and to describe in 
  general terms the nature of its contents. The [defendant] need not produce the 
  documents for inspection at this stage, however. He should object to producing 
  them in Schedule "B" on the basis of a public interest protection until the 
  Attorney General for Ontario and the relevant Police Service have been notified 
  and either (a) those authorities and the parties to the action have consented 
  to production, or (b) the Court, on notice to the Attorney General, the relevant 
  Police Service, and the parties, has determined which documents in the Crown 
  Brief, if any, are to be produced. </p>
<p class="indent">Notwithstanding the foregoing, the [defendant] need not produce 
  the statement he gave to the police as part of the criminal investigation and 
  which was ruled to have been taken in violation of his Charter rights.</p>
<p>
  THE ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [22] The issues that remain to be resolved at this stage of the litigation are 
  the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) Is production of the Crown brief subject to the screening 
  mechanism devised by the Divisional Court?</p>
<p class="indent">(b) Was the Divisional Court correct in holding that the defendant's 
  statement was not subject to production?</p>
<p class="indent">(c) Is a court order always required before the contents of 
  the Crown brief can be produced? (This issue is raised by the Intervenor the 
  Attorney General of Ontario.)</p>
<p>
  (d) Does the screening mechanism apply to police services in defending a civil 
  action? (This issue is raised by the Intervenors the Chiefs of the Toronto and 
  Halton Regional Police Services.)</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (a) Introduction</p>
<p>
  [23] Before this court, the plaintiff essentially supports the position of Juriansz 
  J. She submits that the documents in the Crown brief are in the possession of 
  the defendant, are not subject to any recognized privilege, and should therefore 
  be produced. She submits that the process envisaged by the Divisional Court 
  adds a potentially costly and unnecessary step in the proceeding. She questions 
  the value of notifying the Attorney General and the police service. She points 
  out that under the deemed undertaking rule, she and her counsel are precluded 
  from using any of the information or evidence for any purpose other than that 
  of the proceeding in which the evidence was obtained (Rule 30.1). The trend 
  has been to broaden the right of discovery and that it is considered to be in 
  the public interest that all relevant evidence be available to the court. Finally, 
  she argues that it is unfair that one party (the defendant) has access to relevant 
  information that has been denied to the other party. I point out that counsel 
  for the defendant has undertaken not to use the contents of the Crown brief 
  in the litigation. Counsel for the plaintiff is sceptical that this is possible. 
  He doubts that it is possible for any counsel to disabuse his or her mind of 
  relevant information.</p>
<p>
  (b) Legal foundation for the screening process</p>
<p>
  [24] As the Divisional Court recognized, the screening process devised by that 
  court is not expressly provided for in the Rules of Civil Procedure. The applicable 
  rule is Rule 30. It provides in part as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 30.02(1) Every document relating to any matter in issue in 
  an action that is or has been in the possession, control or power of a party 
  to the action shall be disclosed as provided in rules 30.03 to 30.10, whether 
  or not privilege is claimed in respect of the document.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Every document relating to any matter in issue in an action 
  that is in the possession, control or power of a party to the action shall be 
  produced for inspection if requested, as provided in rules 30.03 to 30.10, unless 
  privilege is claimed in respect of the document.</p>
<p> [25] Rule 30.04 provides that the court may order production of any documents 
  that are not privileged and that are in the possession, control or power of 
  a party. Rule 30.04(6) allows a court to inspect a document to determine the 
  validity of a claim of privilege over it.<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> 
  Since the documents in the Crown disclosure are relevant, they should be subject 
  to production under rule 30.02(2), unless some privilege applies.</p>
<p> [26] While some of the documents in the Crown brief might be privileged, in 
  the ordinary case most would not. As the Divisional Court recognized, documents 
  in a Crown brief are generally not subject to solicitor client or litigation 
  privilege.<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> See N.G. v. Upper Canada College, 
  [2004] O.J. No. 1202 (C.A.), Sharpe J.A. in chambers. While individual documents 
  might be subject to a claim of privilege, the brief itself is not. The process 
  created by the Divisional Court, however, applies to all the documents in the 
  Crown brief.</p>
<p>
  [27] The Divisional Court found the jurisdiction to create the screening process 
  in the court's inherent power to control its process and to protect that process 
  from being abused or obstructed. I agree with this holding. The documents in 
  the Crown disclosure come about because of the common law and Charter obligations 
  imposed by the courts on the Crown to ensure a fair trial for the accused. The 
  Superior Court has the power to regulate the use of such material. The Divisional 
  Court in its reasons at para. 48 referred to this court's decision in R. v. 
  Savion and Mizrahi (1980), 52 C.C.C. (2d) 276. In Savion, a pre-Charter and 
  pre-Stinchombe case, this court held that the court had the power to order the 
  Crown to produce a statement to the accused. This court saw this, at p. 284, 
  as "but one facet of a wider power to order production that flows from 
  the ability of the Court to control its process so as to manifestly ensure fundamental 
  fairness and see that the adversarial process is consistent with the interests 
  of justice". </p>

<p>
  [28] As the Divisional Court pointed out at para. 49, "[A] superior court 
  has original and plenary jurisdiction in all civil and criminal matters including 
  inherent jurisdiction to control and regulate its process and to prevent this 
  from being abused or obstructed". The plaintiff's "right" to 
  disclosure and production of these documents is based on the Rules. The Superior 
  Court must have the power to control the discovery and production process provided 
  for by those Rules to ensure that important state and other third party interests 
  are protected, even if the particular documents do not, strictly speaking, fall 
  within a recognized category of privilege. As an example of the type of sensitive 
  material that may be subject to disclosure by the Crown, see R. v. Trotta, (April 
  23, 2004, unreported, Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  (c) The implied undertaking rule</p>
<p>
  [29] The Divisional Court examined the implied undertaking rule to see whether 
  that rule prevented the defendant from producing the Crown disclosure. If counsel 
  who received disclosure from the Crown was bound not to disclose or produce 
  that material for use in other proceedings, arguably the party could properly 
  refuse to produce the material until relieved of the undertaking. </p>
<p>
  [30] In Goodman v. Rossi (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 359 (C.A.), this court held that 
  there is a common law implied undertaking not to use materials disclosed in 
  civil proceedings in any other proceedings. Morden A.C.J.O., at p. 367, explained 
  that the principal rationale for the rule is "recognition of the general 
  right of privacy which a person has with respect to his or her documents". 
  Since the civil discovery process is "an intrusion on this right under 
  the compulsory processes of the court &#133; this intrusion should not be allowed 
  for any purpose other than that of securing justice in the proceeding in which 
  the discovery takes place". However, he also recognized that there is a 
  broader principle, which is more directly applicable to the facts of this case. 
  He referred at pp. 367-68 to the reasons in Lindsey v. Le Sueur (1913), 29 O.L.R. 
  648 (C.A.) at 655, that because a party had been "given access to and the 
  use of the documents for a particular purpose &#133; there is necessarily an 
  implication that they are not to be used for any other purpose". </p>
<p>
  [31] Interestingly, in his discussion in Goodman v. Rossi as to why the implied 
  undertaking should be recognized in Ontario, at p. 369 Morden A.C.J.O. referred 
  to the Martin Report and the views expressed in the Report "on the importance 
  of privacy interests and of preventing the misuse of materials disclosed by 
  the prosecution". I have already referred to the Martin Report and will 
  return to it below.</p>
<p>
  [32] The common law implied undertaking rule recognized in Goodman v. Rossi 
  does not apply to the documents in the possession of the defendant in this case 
  because that rule was concerned with documents produced through the compulsory 
  civil discovery process. The documents involved in this case were produced through 
  the criminal disclosure process. Since Goodman v. Rossi, as recommended in that 
  decision, the Rules of Civil Procedure have been amended to recognize an implied 
  undertaking rule expressly. Thus, rule 30.1.01(3) provides as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  All parties and their counsel are deemed to undertake not to use evidence or 
  information to which this Rule applies for any purposes other than those of 
  the proceeding in which the evidence was obtained.</p>
<p>
  [33] However, like the common law rule, it applies only to evidence or information 
  obtained inter alia under Rule 30. It would not apply to material that the defendant 
  as accused in the criminal proceedings obtained through the criminal disclosure 
  process as mandated by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 
  3 S.C.R. 326. </p>
<p>
  [34] Strictly speaking, it may not be necessary to decide whether there exists 
  an implied undertaking rule with respect to materials provided to an accused 
  through the criminal disclosure process. I am satisfied that it was open to 
  the Divisional Court to place limits on the production of such materials through 
  the screening process without resort to any implied undertaking rule. However, 
  in light of some of the arguments made in this court, especially by the Attorney 
  General and the Chiefs of Police, it may be helpful to sketch out some of the 
  rationales for such a rule, since this may inform how the screening process 
  should operate.</p>
<p> [35] A convenient starting point is the Martin Report, which dealt at some 
  length with disclosure and flagged concerns about inappropriate dissemination 
  of material in the Crown brief. The Committee made the following recommendations 
  at p. 179: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Committee is of the opinion that it is inappropriate for any counsel 
    to give disclosure materials to the public. Counsel would not be acting responsibly 
    as an officer of the Court if he or she did so.</li>
  <li>The Committee is of the opinion that defence counsel should maintain custody 
    or control over disclosure materials, so that copies of such materials are 
    not improperly disseminated. Special arrangements may be made between defence 
    and Crown counsel, with respect to maintaining control over disclosure materials 
    where an accused is in custody, and the volume of materials disclosed makes 
    it impractical for defence counsel to be present while the material is reviewed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [36] From the commentary accompanying these recommendations it seems apparent 
  that the Martin Committee's principal concern was the improper circulation of 
  materials. The Committee gave examples of materials of a highly sensitive nature 
  being circulated within the penitentiary or being made publicly available. The 
  committee did not address the question of whether it believed defence counsel 
  was under an implied undertaking not to use the materials for other purposes, 
  an example of which is a civil suit flowing out of the criminal prosecution, 
  as in this case.</p>
<p>
  [37] It appears that the Crown brief or parts of it may be produced in some 
  civil proceedings, subject to conditions either imposed by the Crown or the 
  criminal court, as was done in Hedley v. Air Canada (1994), 23 C.P.C. (3d) 352 
  (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)). There is no suggestion that any such conditions or orders 
  were made in relation to the disclosure provided by the Crown in this case and 
  there was no evidence as to whether the Crown generally attempts to impose conditions 
  when providing disclosure to counsel for an accused. </p>
<p>
  [38] Also, as the courts have recognized, there is an important distinction 
  between discovery in a civil context and disclosure in the criminal context. 
  In the civil context, the party is, generally speaking, forced to disclose his 
  or her own documents. Thus, as explained in Goodman v. Rossi, the primary rationale 
  for the implied undertaking rule is founded on the general right of privacy 
  that a person has in his or her own documents. The documents disclosed by the 
  Crown as part of the criminal disclosure process are of a different character. 
  Vertes J. explained the different rationale in Fullowka v. Royal Oak Mines Inc, 
  [1998] N.W.T.R. 42 (S.C.). In that case, counsel for the defendants in the criminal 
  trials resisted disclosure of the Crown brief in related civil proceedings on 
  the basis of a condition attached by the Crown at the time of the criminal disclosure. 
  Vertes J. disagreed that the Crown could unilaterally attach such conditions. 
  He wrote the following at paras. 15 - 16: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Supreme Court of Canada, in R. v. Stinchcombe, [1991] 3 
  S.C.R. 326, set out the Crown's duty to disclose to the defence all material 
  evidence. But the Court noted (at page 331) that the "fruits of the investigation" 
  in the possession of the Crown "are not the property of the Crown for use in 
  securing a conviction but the property of the public to be used to ensure that 
  justice is done." This approach changes the nature of the Crown's interest in 
  disclosure materials from one of a simple proprietary right, with the corollary 
  right to control how the document is used, to that of a more complex nature 
  with the predominant purpose being the furtherance of the public interest in 
  the pursuit of justice.</p>
<p class="indent">According to Stinchcombe, the duty of the Crown to provide full 
  disclosure is an absolute duty subject only to the reviewable discretion regarding 
  the withholding of certain types of information and the timing of disclosure. 
  If the Crown could impose conditions on the recipient of the disclosure materials 
  then can it be the case that the Crown could withhold disclosure should the 
  recipient refuse to acknowledge those conditions? I think not. A refusal to 
  make disclosure would violate the accused's constitutional right to a fair trial. 
  The logical extension of the Crown's position is untenable.</p>
<p>
  [39] Vertes J. went on to hold that there was no statutory bar to production 
  under the Criminal Code or the Privacy Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-21. In a subsequent 
  decision by Vertes J. in the same matter, Fullowka v. Royal Oak Mines Inc., 
  [1998] N.W.T.J. No. 45 (S.C.) at para. 5, he held: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The point here, however, is not how or why a document may have been generated 
  in the first place, but its relevance to this litigation. Absent some identifiable 
  privilege, if relevant documents exist, and if they are in Legge's possession 
  or he has power to obtain them, then they must be produced. At this stage of 
  the proceedings there is no question of whether a document may be ultimately 
  probative or even admissible at trial; it may not be. But that does not preclude 
  production on pre-trial discovery. The requirement at this stage is to produce 
  any document which may relate either directly or indirectly to any matter in 
  question in the action.</p>
<p>
  [40] I agree with the Divisional Court in this case that this statement is too 
  broad and does not give "sufficient recognition to the balancing of public 
  versus private interests that is necessary in such circumstances" (para. 
  38). While the Crown's interest in the disclosure materials is different from 
  the interest of a party to civil litigation, and while that interest is not 
  a simple proprietary right, it does not follow that the courts should not be 
  concerned about the use of such materials in other proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [41] There have been some decisions in this province concerning a possible implied 
  undertaking rule with respect to Crown disclosure materials. In Hedley v. Air 
  Canada at para. 34, Blair J. considered the application of the implied undertaking 
  rule where a party to a civil action seeks to make use of the Crown brief disclosed 
  to that party in criminal proceedings. He could: "see no policy reason 
  why a party to a civil proceeding should be placed in a favoured position simply 
  because that party happens to have been an accused in a related criminal prosecution 
  -- even where that prosecution has been unsuccessful. The principle remains 
  the same: society balances the value of compelling disclosure in criminal and 
  civil matters with a countervailing limit engrafted upon that production; the 
  recipient of the documents is not to utilize them, or the information contained 
  in them, for purposes other than the proceeding in which they have been produced." 
  </p>
<p>
  [42] In Hedley, Blair J. distinguished the earlier decision of the Divisional 
  Court in Consolidated NBS Inc. v. Price Waterhouse (1994), 111 D.L.R. (4th) 
  656 (Ont. Gen. Div.), in which it was held that the implied undertaking rule 
  was inapplicable, because NBS was not a case like Hedley where the party who 
  received disclosure sought to use the documents for a collateral or ulterior 
  purpose. Rather, in NBS the party was being asked to produce documents that 
  the party received as part of the Crown disclosure obligations. </p>
<p>
  [43] The House of Lords considered the implied undertaking rule as it applies 
  in the criminal and civil context in Great Britain in Taylor v. Serious Fraud 
  Office, [1998] 4 All E.R. 801. Lord Hoffman speaking for the majority held at 
  para. 42 that "the disclosure of documents by the prosecution as unused 
  material under its common law obligations did generate an implied undertaking 
  not to use them for any collateral purpose". The reference to "unused 
  material" is material that is disclosed to the accused but does not become 
  evidence in the criminal case. Lord Hoffman left to another day "whether 
  the undertaking applies also to used materials and whether it survives the publication 
  of the statement in open court" but he saw much force in the view "that 
  the court should nevertheless retain control over certain collateral uses of 
  the documents, including the bringing of libel proceedings" (para 42). 
  </p>
<p>
  [44] Lord Hoffman discussed the policy reasons for an implied undertaking rule 
  respecting criminal disclosure materials at paras. 36 and 37 of the Taylor case: </p>
<p class="indent"> Many people give assistance to the police and other investigatory 
  agencies, either voluntarily or under compulsion, without coming within the 
  category of informers whose identity can be concealed on grounds of public interest. 
  They will be moved or obliged to give the information because they or the law 
  consider that the interests of justice so require. They must naturally accept 
  that the interests of justice may in the end require the publication of the 
  information or at any rate its disclosure to the accused for the purposes of 
  enabling him to conduct his defence. But there seems to me no reason why the 
  law should not encourage their assistance by offering them the assurance that, 
  subject to these overriding requirements, their privacy and confidentiality 
  will be respected.</p>
<p class="indent">One must also consider the interests of persons who are mentioned 
  in the statements. Information given to the police or investigatory authorities 
  will frequently contain defamatory or at least hurtful allegations about other 
  people. That is to be expected in a criminal investigation. Such people may 
  never be charged or know that they were under suspicion or that anything untoward 
  was said about them. If such allegations are given publicity during the course 
  of the proceedings, they will have to suffer the consequences because of the 
  public interest in open justice. Even then, the judge will often be able to 
  prevent the introduction of allegations about third parties which are not relevant 
  to the issues in the case. But there seems to me no reason why the accused should 
  be free, outside court, to publish such statements to the world at large. The 
  possibility of a defamation action is for most people too expensive and impractical 
  to amount to an adequate remedy. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [45] The implied undertaking rule in criminal proceedings has now been codified 
  in Great Britain in s. 17 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 
  (U.K.), 1996, c.25. To summarize, an accused who has been given a document or 
  other object pursuant to the Crown's disclosure obligations must not use or 
  disclose it or any information recorded in it except "in connection with 
  the proceedings for whose purposes he was given the object or allowed to inspect 
  it". The prohibition does not apply to any object or information to the 
  extent that it was displayed to the public in open court. The accused may apply 
  to a court for an order granting permission to use or disclose the object or 
  information.</p>
<p>
  [46] There are important policy reasons for recognizing an implied undertaking 
  rule with respect to disclosure of materials to the defence in a criminal case. 
  The disclosure is compulsory and required because of the public interest in 
  ensuring that the accused obtains a fair trial of the criminal charges. However, 
  as a result of the criminal disclosure process, individuals, including innocent 
  third parties, may find that highly personal information is made available to 
  the accused. These individuals must, as explained in Taylor, accept this intrusion 
  in the interests of achieving a proper result in the criminal case, but the 
  law should provide them with some reasonable protection against use of the information 
  for entirely different purposes. In addition to the policy reasons referred 
  to in Taylor, which essentially concern privacy interests of third parties, 
  there are the policy reasons identified by the Divisional Court in this case, 
  namely the fact that the disclosure may contain documents over which the Crown 
  could claim public interest immunity, that might attract privilege or which 
  broadly speaking it is not in the public interest to produce. </p>
<p> [47] As I said earlier, it is not, strictly speaking, necessary to decide 
  in this case whether there is an implied undertaking rule applicable to Crown 
  disclosure. While it would seem to me that there are compelling reasons for 
  recognizing such a rule, we did not have complete argument on the issue. As 
  well, all persons who might have an interest in the nature and breadth of such 
  a rule<a href="#a">[4]</a><a name="4"></a> were not before the court in this 
  case.<a href="#a">[5]</a><a name="5"></a> I am therefore reluctant to lay down 
  a rule in this case that could have important practical consequences in other 
  types of litigation. Suffice it to say, the compelling reasons for possibly 
  recognizing an implied undertaking rule justify the adoption of the screening 
  process where the Crown brief, for whatever reason, finds its way into the hands 
  of a party in a civil case.</p>
<p>
  (d) The nature of the screening process</p>
<p>
  [48] Like the Divisional Court, I can see no practical way of protecting the 
  interests discussed by that court and by the House of Lords in Taylor without 
  giving the bodies responsible for creating the disclosure, the Crown and the 
  police, notice that production is sought. Further, where the Crown or police 
  resist production the court must be the final arbiter.</p>
<p>
  [49] I do not think that the various interests will be protected because of 
  the implied undertaking rule in Rule 30.1. The fact that civil counsel obtaining 
  production is bound not to use the information for a collateral purpose may 
  be little comfort for persons who once again find their privacy invaded, this 
  time in civil rather than criminal proceedings. Further, the Stinchcombe obligation 
  on the police and Crown is very broad. Subject to privilege the Crown must disclose 
  all relevant information. If there is a reasonable possibility that the withholding 
  of information will impair the right of the accused to make full answer and 
  defence, the information must be disclosed. Crown counsel are urged in Stinchcombe 
  at p. 339 to err on the side of inclusion and refuse to disclose only that which 
  is clearly irrelevant. The courts ought not to apply the discovery rules in 
  civil cases in a way that could have an unintended chilling effect on Crown 
  counsel's disclosure obligations.</p>
<p>
  [50] Admittedly, the screening mechanism devised by the Divisional Court is 
  not a perfect solution. The obligation to notify the Crown and the police may 
  not fully protect the privacy interests of third parties. Those third parties 
  will be dependent upon the Crown or police protecting their interests or notifying 
  them so that they can protect their own interests. I am also, naturally, concerned 
  about costs to the parties by potentially having to litigate one more motion. 
  There is also the cost to the system because of the need to resort to scarce 
  judicial resources. The affidavit filed on behalf of the Attorney General in 
  this case speaks to the increasing number of requests for access to Crown briefs 
  for use in civil proceedings. However, I see no reasonable alternative. </p>
<p>
  [51] It is to be hoped that most of these issues will be resolved on consent 
  without court intervention. To that end, I would offer these comments. I would 
  expect that the parties and the state agents could usually agree to disclosure 
  of the materials in many circumstances. Where the party in possession of the 
  Crown brief has access to the materials, fairness will generally dictate that 
  they be produced to the other side. This was the view of the Divisional Court 
  in Lang v. Crowe, [2000] O.J. No. 653 at para. 11: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This Court accepts that there are serious policy and public interest issues 
  which must be considered where counsel in subsequent civil proceedings seek 
  production of Crown briefs prepared in related criminal proceedings. In this 
  case, however, where one party has had and continues to enjoy access to certain 
  documents which it has intimated it intends to use in its defence of the civil 
  proceedings brought against it, documents still in the possession of its counsel 
  of record, we are of the view that in these peculiar and particular circumstances, 
  the overriding consideration should be fairness to all the parties. It seems 
  to us to be inherently unfair for Goodyear [a defendant], to have the Crown 
  Brief while it is denied to the other parties. </p>
<p>
  [52] As well, the parties and the state agents should agree to produce any information 
  in the Crown brief that was used in court in the course of the criminal prosecution, 
  subject to some interest of superordinate importance, such as private records 
  of sexual assault complainants or confidential medical records. Thus, in Goodman 
  v. Rossi at p. 375, Morden A.C.J.O. would have incorporated into the common 
  law implied undertaking rule the qualification in rule 14A of Order 24 of the 
  Rules of the Supreme Court: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Any undertaking, whether express or implied, not to use a document for any purposes 
  other than those of the proceedings in which it is disclosed shall cease to 
  apply to such document after it has been read to or by the Court, or referred 
  to, in open Court, unless the Court for special reasons has otherwise ordered 
  on the application of a party or of the person to whom the document belongs. 
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [53] In considering a request for production the police and Crown will bear 
  in mind the comments by Vertes J. in Fullowka v. Royal Oak Mines Inc. that the 
  Crown does not have a simple proprietary interest in the Crown disclosure. As 
  he said at para. 15, "the 'fruits of the investigation' in the possession 
  of the Crown 'are not the property of the Crown for use in securing a conviction 
  but the property of the public to be used to ensure that justice is done'". 
  Society has an interest in seeing that justice is done in civil cases as well 
  as criminal cases, and generally speaking that will occur when the parties have 
  the opportunity to put all relevant evidence before the court. The Crown disclosure 
  may be helpful to the parties in ensuring that they secure all relevant evidence.</p>
<p>
  [54] The guiding objective to be applied by the parties, the state agents and 
  the court hearing any motion for production thus ought to be what Anderson J. 
  said in Reichmann v. Toronto Life Publishing Co. (1988), 28 C.P.C. (2d) 11 (Ont. 
  H.C.J.), motion for leave to appeal to the Divisional Court dismissed (1988), 
  29 C.P.C. (2d) 66 (Ont. H.C.J.) at p.14: "The consistent tendency in this 
  province has been to broaden and not circumscribe the right of discovery." 
  This principle is founded on the underlying principle accepted by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada for both civil and criminal cases in Stinchcombe where Sopinka 
  J. said at p. 332: "This change [to full discovery in civil cases] resulted 
  from acceptance of the principle that justice was better served when the element 
  of surprise was eliminated from the trial and the parties were prepared to address 
  issues on the basis of complete information of the case to be met." And 
  as he said at p. 335, "[T]he principle has been accepted that the search 
  for truth is advanced rather than retarded by disclosure of all relevant material."</p>
<p>
  [55] The plaintiff submits that practically speaking a motion and attendance 
  in court will always be required, because the person in possession of the Crown 
  brief, usually the defendant, will always object to production. I am not as 
  pessimistic as the plaintiff. In any event, where a party has unreasonably withheld 
  its consent, the matter can be taken into account in fixing costs.</p>
<p>
  (e) The statements</p>
<p>
  [56] In my view, the Divisional Court erred in holding that the defendant should 
  not be required to produce his statements to the police. So far as I can tell, 
  the Divisional Court did not have before it the ruling by the trial judge in 
  the criminal prosecution nor any of the evidence led before the trial judge. 
  The Divisional Court held at paras. 67 and 68, however, that violation of the 
  right to counsel is "not a trivial occurrence" and that "Charter 
  considerations apply equally at this stage of the proceedings with respect to 
  the contaminated statement of Dr. Wagg, in the circumstances of this case". 
  It is not clear how the court was able to conclude that the violation was not 
  a trivial occurrence or what circumstances led it to conclude that the same 
  Charter considerations apply equally in the criminal context as in the discovery 
  phase of a civil trial. It may be that the court was of the view that any violation 
  of the right to counsel is such a serious matter and so closely associated with 
  the administration of justice that the same result must follow in the civil 
  and the criminal contexts. </p>
<p>
  [57] In any event, I cannot agree with this conclusion. There is a broad spectrum 
  of police conduct that can lead to a violation of an accused's s. 10(b) rights. 
  Some violations can be very serious. Consider R. v. Burlingham, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 
  206 where the police persisted in questioning the accused although he had asked 
  for counsel and had not had a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel. In 
  that case, the police belittled the accused's lawyer with the express goal or 
  effect of undermining the accused's confidence in a relationship with defence 
  counsel and then pressured the accused into accepting a plea bargain without 
  first having the opportunity to consult with his lawyer. Then, there are cases 
  like R. v. Prosper, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 236 and R. v. Harper, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 343 
  where the violation of s. 10(b) was found where the police failed to inform 
  the accused of the availability of duty counsel, at a time when the law was 
  at least unclear whether such information had to be given to the accused. </p>
<p>
  [58] Having read the trial judge's ruling in this case, I would not characterize 
  the violation as particularly serious. The trial judge found that the police 
  officer fully complied with the s. 10(b) requirements when he first began to 
  interview the accused/defendant. The violation seems to have arisen because 
  the police officer did not repeat the s. 10(b) right a second time, only minutes 
  later, after the officer informed the accused of the specific allegations made 
  by the complainant/plaintiff.</p>
<p>
  [59] All this brings me to the question of the application of the Charter to 
  civil proceedings. The Divisional Court proceeded on the basis that although 
  the Charter did not directly apply, Charter values informed the common law and 
  required that the "contaminated" statement not be produced. The application 
  of the Charter in this case is a difficult question. In my view it might well 
  be open to the defendant to argue that the Charter directly applies at the trial. 
  Section 24 of the Charter provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been 
  infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain 
  such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.</p>
<p>(2) Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), a court concludes that evidence 
  was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed 
  by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having 
  regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would 
  bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</p>
<p>
  [60] The defendant could, it seems to me, argue that his rights were infringed 
  by a state agent (the police officer) and he is therefore entitled to an appropriate 
  and just remedy. If he sought exclusion of the statement as a remedy he would 
  have to establish that admission of the statement would bring the administration 
  of justice into disrepute.</p>
<p>
  [61] For the purposes of this case, I am also prepared to assume that the Divisional 
  Court is correct that Charter values should inform the discovery process, including 
  the production of the defendant's statement.</p>
<p>
  [62] Where I part company with the Divisional Court is in their finding that 
  production of the statement would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
  First, that determination could only be made by a court that had been apprised 
  of all the circumstances under which the statement was made. Second, I disagree 
  with the Divisional Court that the same considerations that would lead to exclusion 
  of the statement in the criminal context apply in the civil context. If the 
  statement could be admitted in the civil trial, I do not see any basis for preventing 
  its production at the discovery stage. Third, even if a court could determine 
  at this early stage that the statement would not be admissible at trial, in 
  my view, it should still have been ordered produced.</p>
<p>
  [63] The first two points can be dealt together since they hinge on the application 
  of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Stillman, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 
  607. Subject to certain exceptions that are not germane to this case, the majority 
  of the Supreme Court held in Stillman that "conscriptive evidence" 
  is inadmissible at a criminal trial, even without consideration of the other 
  categories of Collins factors (R. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265). Those other 
  factors include the seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion of 
  the evidence on the administration of justice. If the evidence obtained from 
  the defendant in this case was conscriptive and if Stillman applied equally 
  in the civil context, the trial judge would be bound to exclude the evidence, 
  just as the trial judge had done in the criminal case. The Divisional Court 
  referred to this principle in its reasons at para. 67: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Authorities such as R. v. Stillman, &#133; make it clear that conscripted evidence, 
  obtained by state action in violation of an individual's Charter rights, is 
  inherently tainted and that such evidence -- and evidence derived from it -- 
  is most likely to be excluded from evidence in criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [64] The Divisional Court's error, in my view, was that the court, in effect, 
  borrowed the Stillman analysis from the criminal context and transplanted it 
  in the civil context without consideration of the very different issues and 
  values at stake in the two types of proceedings. The cornerstone of the Stillman 
  analysis is the court's understanding of a "fair trial". Conscriptive 
  evidence obtained by violation of a Charter right is excluded from the criminal 
  trial because it affects the accused's right to a fair trial. However, 'fair 
  trial' has a very special meaning in this context: it refers to the manner in 
  which evidence was obtained, not to the way the trial itself is conducted. This 
  notion of trial fairness is summarized in para. 73 of Cory J.'s majority reasons 
  in Stillman: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is apparent from this passage [from R. v. Collins] that the primary aim and 
  purpose of considering the trial fairness factor in the s. 24(2) analysis is 
  to prevent an accused person whose Charter rights have been infringed from being 
  forced or conscripted to provide evidence in the form of statements or bodily 
  samples for the benefit of the state. It is because the accused is compelled 
  as a result of a Charter breach to participate in the creation or discovery 
  of self-incriminating evidence in the form of confessions, statements or the 
  provision of bodily samples, that the admission of that evidence would generally 
  tend to render the trial unfair. That general rule, like all rules, may be subject 
  to rare exceptions. [Italics in original, bold added.]</p>
<p>
  [65] This special meaning of trial fairness in the Charter context is itself 
  rooted in the fundamental tenet of the criminal justice system that an accused 
  is not required to assist the prosecution in making out a case against him or 
  her and is not required to respond to the prosecution's case until the Crown 
  has made out a case to meet without the compelled participation of the accused. 
  Cory J. makes this point in Stillman at para. 100 in referring to passages from 
  R. v. Burlingham at paras. 144-45: </p>
<p class="indent">
  ... it is unfair for the Crown to make out its case in whole or in part by the 
  use of evidence that it obtained in breach of the rights of the accused and 
  involving his or her participation. ...</p>
<p>
  The participation of the accused in providing incriminating evidence involving 
  a breach of Charter rights is the ingredient that tends to render the trial 
  unfair as he or she is not under any obligation to assist the Crown to secure 
  a conviction. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [66] The Divisional Court in this case seemed to recognize that the values underlying 
  a civil case are different from a criminal case. At para. 75, the Divisional 
  Court referred to a passage from p. 659 of the court's earlier decision in NBS 
  Consolidated Inc.: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There is no principle against self-incrimination in a civil proceeding. The 
  pendulum swings in the opposite direction. A litigant is under a compulsion 
  to submit to oral discovery and obliged to seek out relevant documents for an 
  affidavit on production.</p>
<p>
  [67] However, the court did not see that this distinction made any difference 
  to this case. It reached this conclusion on the theory that it could not accept 
  that the "principle against self-incrimination in civil proceedings is 
  intended to buttress and encourage production of documents conscripted from 
  an individual through an abuse of state power and in contravention of the Charter" 
  (para. 76). While I recognize the court's concern about abuse of state power, 
  that provides no justification for importing into civil cases the criminal rule 
  of automatic exclusion of conscripted evidence. </p>
<p>
  [68] Most importantly, however, the court failed to recognize that the rule 
  of automatic exclusion of conscripted evidence as developed in Stillman depends 
  on the fundamental principle that accused are not required to assist the state 
  in making out the case against them. Given that no such principle applies in 
  the civil context, the rationale for the Divisional Court's conclusion is undermined. 
  </p>
<p>
  [69] Therefore, whether the Charter applies directly through s. 24 or indirectly 
  by infusing the question of the admission of the defendant's statement in the 
  civil case with Charter values, it seems to me that one is inevitably bound 
  to consider all the circumstances of the case. It is only then that a court 
  can decide whether admission of the evidence would bring the administration 
  of justice into disrepute. In my view, only the trial judge would be in a position 
  to make that determination. The trial judge would be required to consider, for 
  example, the seriousness of the Charter violation that led to the evidence having 
  been obtained. The trial judge would also have to take into account the effect 
  of excluding the evidence on the administration of justice bearing in mind, 
  for example, that the plaintiff played no part in the Charter violation and 
  that she may require the evidence to assist her in proving her case.</p>
<p>
  [70] Finally, even if the statement were not admissible at the instance of the 
  plaintiff at the civil trial, it might be held to be admissible for the purpose 
  of impeaching the defendant through cross-examination. In the criminal context, 
  the Supreme Court has held that the Crown will be allowed to cross-examine an 
  accused on conscripted evidence obtained in violation of the Charter only in 
  "special circumstances". See R. v. Cook, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 597 at para. 
  75. However, there is no reason to believe that the same test should be applied 
  in civil cases.</p>
<p>
  [71] If the defendant's statement is potentially admissible at trial, it should 
  be subject to production. I can find no policy basis for refusing production 
  of this apparently relevant, and perhaps highly probative evidence. Even if 
  I am wrong and the statement would not be admissible in evidence under any circumstances, 
  in my view the statement would still be subject to production. It is apparently 
  relevant and its mere production may assist the plaintiff in assembling her 
  case. I disagree with the Divisional Court that its mere production "would 
  bring the administration of justice into disrepute" (para. 68). I cannot 
  identify any relevant Charter values such as privacy that would weigh against 
  mere production of the statement. </p>
<p> [72] The statement is not privileged. There is nothing in the record to indicate 
  that the statement was provided to the police in circumstances of confidence 
  such as those to which the Divisional Court referred at para. 68 of Consolidated 
  NBS Inc. In Consolidated NBS Inc. the court applied the "Wigmore Test". That 
  test was held by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Gruenke, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 
  263 to be a principled basis for recognizing, on a case-by-case analysis, when 
  communications falling outside the established categories of common law privileges 
  would be held to be privileged. The court found that the statement made by a 
  third party to the action (an accused in the criminal case) had been given to 
  the R.C.M.P. in circumstances that fulfilled all the requirements of the Wigmore 
  test and was therefore privileged and not subject to production. From my reading 
  of the trial judge's s. 10(b) ruling in this case, this statement could not 
  meet the Wigmore criteria. Fundamentally it did not originate in a confidence 
  that it would not be disclosed. To the contrary, the police gave the defendant 
  the standard police caution, which includes a warning that his statement could 
  be used in evidence at trial. To the extent that the Divisional Court seems 
  to have held to the contrary, in my view, that was an error.<a href="#a">[6]</a><a name="6"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [73] The final matter with which I wish to deal in respect of the statement 
  is the question of issue estoppel. The Divisional Court recognized that issue 
  estoppel or res judicata did not strictly apply because the plaintiff was not 
  a full party to the criminal proceeding. The court, however, applied an abuse 
  of process type of reasoning to hold that the admission of the statement should 
  not be relitigated in the civil context. The court reasoned as follows at paras. 
  77 and 78: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is neither appropriate nor essential that the issue be re-litigated in the 
  civil proceedings, in my opinion. </p>
<p>
  The question whether the accused's statement was taken by the police in breach 
  of the Charter is not a question in which the plaintiff/complainant has a legitimate 
  interest. It is a question between the defendant/accused and the state. It has 
  been resolved by a court decision. A statement cannot be taken contrary to the 
  Charter for criminal purposes but not contrary to the Charter for civil purposes. 
  No other court determination is fitting or required in the circumstances of 
  this case.</p>
<p>
  [74] A recent decision dealing with the intersection of criminal and civil proceedings 
  is Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E, Local 79, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77, which was decided 
  well after the decision of the Divisional Court in this case. In C.U.P.E., an 
  employee of the city had been convicted of sexual assault of a boy whom the 
  accused had supervised in the course of his duties with the city. The city terminated 
  his employment. The union grieved the dismissal and the arbitrator found that 
  the offence had not occurred, and ordered the employee reinstated. Writing for 
  the court, Arbour J. held that issue estoppel had no application because the 
  requirement of mutuality of parties was not met. The criminal case was between 
  the Crown and the employee. The arbitration was between the union and the city. 
  Even if the employee and the union could be viewed as privies, the Crown, acting 
  as prosecutor in a criminal case, was not privy with the city. </p>
<p>
  [75] However, the doctrine of abuse of process precluded the relitigation of 
  the finding that the employee had committed a sexual assault. At para. 37, Arbour 
  J. held that: "Canadian courts have applied the doctrine of abuse of process 
  to preclude relitigation in circumstances where the strict requirements of issue 
  estoppel (typically the privity/mutuality requirements) are not met, but where 
  allowing the litigation to proceed would nonetheless violate such principles 
  as judicial economy, consistency, finality and the integrity of the administration 
  of justice". A fair reading of the C.U.P.E. case suggests that relitigation 
  of a criminal conviction in subsequent civil proceedings will generally amount 
  to an abuse of process. Nevertheless, at para. 52 of her reasons, Arbour J. 
  identified circumstances where relitigation would not be an abuse of process: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There may be instances where relitigation will enhance, rather than impeach, 
  the integrity of the judicial system, for example: (1) when the first proceeding 
  is tainted by fraud or dishonesty; (2) when fresh, new evidence, previously 
  unavailable, conclusively impeaches the original results; or (3) when fairness 
  dictates that the original result should not be binding in the new context. 
  This was stated unequivocally by this Court in Danyluk, supra, at para. 80.</p>
<p>
  [76] In Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., [2001] 2 S.C.R. 460 at para. 
  80, Binnie J. held: "As a final and most important factor, the Court should 
  stand back and, taking into account the entirety of the circumstances, consider 
  whether application of issue estoppel in the particular case would work an injustice."</p>
<p>
  [77] In my view, this is a case where fairness dictates that the original result 
  not be binding in the new context. As I have explained, the most important feature 
  is that the analysis of whether or not to exclude evidence for a Charter breach 
  is entirely different in the civil context than in the criminal context. Thus, 
  while abuse of process principles might dictate that the judge presiding in 
  the civil proceedings should accept the finding of a Charter violation, it would 
  work an injustice to require the plaintiff to abide by the admissibility decision 
  made by the criminal court judge. Put another way, accepting the comment of 
  the Divisional Court that a statement "cannot be taken contrary to the 
  Charter for criminal purposes but not contrary to the Charter for civil purposes" 
  does not require accepting, in the civil proceedings, the determination of admissibility 
  made for the purpose of the criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>
  (f) The need for a court order</p>
<p>
  [78] The Attorney General of Ontario takes the position that a party seeking 
  to use the Crown brief outside of the criminal proceedings for which it was 
  produced requires a court order to do so. The Attorney General also submits 
  that the Crown's consent "may be problematic because of confidentiality 
  and privacy concerns belonging to witnesses and other individuals who may [be] 
  identified in Crown disclosure materials". The Attorney General also seems 
  to take the position that only a judge of the Superior Court of Justice would 
  have jurisdiction to make such an order. The question of whether a Master would 
  have the jurisdiction to conduct the screening process and make the necessary 
  order was not the subject of argument. In N.G. v. Upper Canada College, Sharpe 
  J.A. held that a Master had jurisdiction under rule 30.10 (production from non-party) 
  to order production of a videotape in the possession of the Crown. In my view, 
  a Master would similarly have jurisdiction to conduct the screening process 
  mandated in this case and order production of parts of the Crown brief pursuant 
  to rule 30.04(5).</p>
<p>
  [79] I agree with the Divisional Court that if the relevant police service and 
  the Attorney General consent to production, then there is no need for a court 
  order. While neither the police service nor the Attorney General have a simple 
  proprietary right over the Crown brief, the brief is brought into existence 
  through their efforts. If the police or the Crown are concerned that third party 
  interests in the particular case are not adequately protected, they can give 
  notice to that party and refuse to consent. There may also be cases where an 
  order is appropriate because the Attorney General or the police seek to impose 
  conditions on the use of the documents and the parties cannot agree on those 
  conditions. In those cases, which would probably be rare, the court will then 
  make the final determination. As well, there will be cases where conditions 
  have been expressly imposed by or with the agreement of the criminal court, 
  for example, on the use of videotaped statements by complainants in sexual assault 
  cases. See R. v. Smith (1994), 146 Sask. R. 202 (Q.B.). In those cases, a further 
  order of the court will be required to permit production. I can, however, see 
  no good reason for always requiring a pro forma order from a court where such 
  concerns are not involved.</p>
<p>
  [80] The Attorney General also founded the argument for a court order on the 
  basis of the implied undertaking rule. I have already dealt with the implied 
  undertaking rule and declined to rule conclusively on whether the rule exists 
  with respect to criminal disclosure. However, even if it did, it would undoubtedly 
  resemble the common law implied undertaking rule dealt with in Goodman v. Rossi. 
  In that case, Morden A.C.J.O. held at p. 371 that a person could obtain relief 
  from the application of the rule by a motion to the court "or the consent 
  of the party from whom the document was obtained". This aspect of the rule 
  is now codified in rule 30.1.01(4), which provides that the deemed undertaking 
  "does not prohibit a use to which the person who disclosed the evidence 
  consents." </p>
<p>
  [81] Where production of Crown disclosure is sought, persons other than the 
  person who disclosed the document may have interests that need to be taken into 
  account. Thus, the Divisional Court rightly imposed a requirement that the police 
  and the Attorney General consent to the production of the document. However, 
  where the parties consent and the police and the Attorney General also consent, 
  I can see no principled basis for requiring the intervention of the court. The 
  Crown, police or the parties may wish to attach conditions to the consent, although 
  it would seem to me that once production has been made, the deemed undertaking 
  rule in rule 31.1.01(3) would suffice in most circumstances to protect against 
  improper use of the material.</p>
<p>
  (g) Defence by police of civil actions</p>
<p>
  [82] The Chiefs of the Toronto and Halton Region Police Services intervened 
  in this appeal principally to put forward the position that the screening mechanism 
  should not apply to a police force when it is required to defend itself against 
  a civil action, such as an action for malicious prosecution. Apparently, the 
  Attorney General has taken the position that the police service requires the 
  consent of the Attorney General to use the contents of the Crown brief.</p>
<p>
  [83] I agree with the Chiefs that the screening process developed by the Divisional 
  Court in this case does not apply to the original materials that ultimately 
  find their way into the Crown brief. This case concerns the use of materials 
  disclosed to the accused as part of the constitutionally mandated disclosure 
  process. Those materials will contain copies of various kinds of documents such 
  as officers' notes, witness statements, potential exhibits, and other materials 
  such as copies of videotapes and photographs. The originals remain with the 
  police, although some may be entered as exhibits. The Crown brief may also contain 
  copies of notes or other material produced by Crown counsel. Again, the originals 
  would remain with Crown counsel, or perhaps would be left with the police for 
  safekeeping.</p>
<p>
  [84] I can see nothing in the decision of the Divisional Court that was intended 
  to circumscribe the use that a police service may make of its own documents 
  and other materials merely because copies of those materials found their way 
  into the Crown brief and were disclosed to the defence. This material is essential 
  to permit the police service to defend itself against lawsuits arising out of 
  their investigations.</p>
<p>
  [85] The question of use by a former accused of material in the Crown brief 
  in an action against the police was not before the court in this case. Accordingly, 
  I would leave that issue for another day, where the matter is directly raised.</p>
<p>
  [86] To conclude, in actions against the police the screening process discussed 
  in this case does not apply to the original materials prepared by the police 
  during their investigation. The police would only require the consent of the 
  Attorney General in respect of the use of materials created by Crown counsel.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [87] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal in part and set aside that part of 
  the Divisional Court's order that the defendant need not produce the statement 
  he gave to the police as part of the criminal investigation. Ordinarily, the 
  question of the production of the statement would now be determined by the screening 
  process. However, this court has heard full argument on the issue and I would 
  prefer to reduce any further unnecessary cost to the parties. The Attorney General 
  intervened in the appeal and did not raise any specific objection to production 
  of the statement. Counsel did submit, however, that pertinent information and 
  relevant participants were not before the Divisional Court, and that therefore 
  the question of production should be dealt with when the Superior Court deals 
  with production of the entire Crown brief. It is not apparent to me, however, 
  whether the plaintiff has an interest in the Crown brief outside the statements. 
  </p>
<p>
  [88] In any event, in my view, this court is in a position to make the limited 
  determination of whether or not to order the defendant to produce the statements. 
  Accordingly, I would direct the defendant to provide a copy of this decision 
  to the police service involved in taking the statement. If neither the police 
  service nor the Attorney General opposes production of the statement within 
  ten days, the defendant, in accordance with the Rules, will produce the statement. 
  If the police service or the Attorney General oppose production, they will have 
  ten days to serve and file brief written argument with this court. The plaintiff 
  and the defendant will have ten days to serve and file a written response to 
  that argument.</p>
<p>
  [89] As to costs, since success on this appeal has been divided, I would order 
  that each side bear its own costs. The Intervenors did not seek costs and I 
  would make no order of costs against them.</p>
