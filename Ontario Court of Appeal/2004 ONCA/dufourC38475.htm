<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his wife and was sentenced 
  to fourteen months custody and probation for two years. As well, an order with 
  a ten year duration was imposed under s. 110 of the Criminal Code. The appellant 
  appeals his conviction, having served the custodial portion of his sentence.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant and his wife were married for less than a year when they separated. 
  They had been separated for approximately a month and a half when the appellant 
  went to the wife's apartment and asked to be admitted in order to return a pair 
  of jeans he said belonged to the wife. The wife let him in. The appellant had 
  sex with his wife. The wife went to work and, some twelve hours later, went 
  to the police station and alleged that she had been sexually assaulted. The 
  appellant admitted having sex with his wife but said that the sex was consensual. 
  He was convicted at trial and the summary conviction appeal judge (SCAJ) dismissed 
  his appeal. </p>
<p>
  [3] Before us, the appellant advances two grounds of appeal. The first ground 
  of appeal concerns the admissibility of evidence regarding the appellant's prior 
  discreditable conduct with his wife. The second ground of appeal relates to 
  similar fact evidence from the appellant's former common law wife. </p>
<p>
  [4] With respect to the first ground of appeal, the trial judge admitted the 
  evidence on the basis of this court's decision in R. v. D.S.F. (1999), 132 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.). In that case, evidence that the accused was an abusive 
  and controlling person was admitted to explain why the complainant had not left 
  the relationship and reported the allegations of sexual assault earlier, as 
  well as to provide narrative context and evidence of motive. In the case before 
  us, the appellant first went to work before going to the police. At trial, the 
  defence did not take the position that the delay in reporting was irrelevant 
  and, on the voir dire relating to the admissibility of the evidence concerning 
  the appellant's prior discreditable conduct, put to the complainant that there 
  was no reason why she could not have called the police immediately after the 
  alleged assault. After balancing the probative effect of the evidence against 
  its prejudice, the trial judge admitted the evidence. The appellant submits 
  that the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence had any probative 
  value. We disagree. In our opinion, in accordance with D.S.F, the evidence was 
  admissible with respect to the narrative or context of events and to show animus 
  or motive on the part of the appellant. It was also relevant to explain why 
  the complainant first went to work before going to the police to report the 
  assault by the appellant. Accordingly, the first ground of appeal fails.</p>
<p>
  [5] The second ground of appeal relates to similar act evidence from the appellant's 
  former common law spouse. The trial judge erred in admitting this evidence as 
  going to credibility at large. In addition, he did not engage in any proper 
  weighing of the dissimilarities of the acts as well as their similarities. The 
  SCAJ, in the end, deferred to the trial judge's decision to admit the evidence. 
  In so doing he also erred. Neither of them had the benefit of the Supreme Court 
  of Canada's recent decision in R. v. Handy, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908. We are therefore 
  required to re-examine and re-weigh the evidence in accordance with the analytical 
  framework of Handy and to decide whether the evidence should have been admitted.</p>
<p>
  [6] The similar act evidence was relevant to the issue of the consent component 
  of the actus reus of the offence charged. The degree of similarity between the 
  acts was sufficient. In both cases there was a threatened or actual separation 
  followed by forced sexual acts after which the appellant apologized and admitted 
  that he had "raped" the victim. The dissimilarities in the nature 
  of the sexual conduct did not have a great bearing on the issue of consent in 
  this case. There was no evidence of collusion. The probative value of the evidence 
  was high, and we are of the view that it outweighs any prejudicial effect. The 
  fact that four years separated the two incidents does not make them so remote 
  as to remove their probative value.</p>
<p>
  [7] Accordingly, although the evidence was admitted at trial on the wrong basis, 
  it was properly admissible. There was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of 
  justice occasioned by the evidence being admitted and, therefore, the appeal 
  is dismissed.</p>
