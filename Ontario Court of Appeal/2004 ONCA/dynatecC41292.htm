<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the motions judge erred in finding that Bishop J. made no 
  jurisdictional errors. In particular, Bishop J. made no finding of a Charter 
  breach, yet purported to grant Charter remedies in ordering discovery, cross-examination 
  and costs. On this record, there was no basis for finding a Charter breach. 
  Delayed disclosure does not necessarily constitute a Charter breach; nor does 
  the failure to disclose material which the Crown, in good faith, believes is 
  irrelevant. See R. v. Elliott, [2003] O.J. No. 4694 at paras. 155-163 and 166. 
  For that reason alone, we would find that there was jurisdictional error. </p>
<p>[2] In addition, we are of the view that some of the remedies ordered by Bishop 
  J. denied the appellant its right to natural justice and therefore also constituted 
  jurisdictional error. Specifically, we are referring to the order for disclosure 
  of evidence which, on its face, was subject to solicitor-client privilege, without 
  providing an opportunity for submissions on the subject of the privilege. Similarly, 
  the award of $82,000 in costs was made without giving the Crown the opportunity 
  to make submissions on the quantum.</p>
<p>[3] As for the order requiring that an affidavit be produced, to the extent 
  that it was not a Charter remedy, the trial judge exceeded his jurisdiction 
  by requiring the Crown to create evidence for the defence's benefit.</p>
<p>[4] In these unusual circumstances, the tests in R. v. Duvivier (1991), 64 
  C.C.C. (3d) 20 (Ont. C.A.) and in s. 141(4) of the Provincial Offences Act, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 have been met. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the 
  order of Ewaschuk J. is set aside, and the order of Bishop J. is quashed. If 
  the trial judge is of the view that further disclosure is required of matters 
  which the Crown, in good faith, believed to be irrelevant, the appropriate order 
  may be made.</p>
<p>[5] There will be no order as to costs.<br>
