<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Maurice C. Cullity of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated July 13, 2001.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal from the decision of Cullity J. who summarized the major 
  issues at trial as follows:</p>
<p class="indent"> This litigation concerns&#133;the alleged interests of (the 
  appellant) Jodi (Edell) and her issue in Paul (Sitzer's) estate under the doctrine 
  of mutual wills, or otherwise pursuant to a constructive trust or other equitable 
  obligation, and their interests as beneficiaries of the Jodi Trust. </p>
<p>
  [2] Except for some aspects that need not be addressed here, the trial judge, 
  after a 21?day trial, dismissed the appellants' claims with costs.</p>
<p>
  [3] Paul and Sidney Sitzer are brothers and successful businessmen who built 
  a real estate business and own substantial commercial properties through various 
  share structures. In 1989-90, the brothers executed an estate freeze intended 
  to minimize tax on death and to plan for their succession. As part of the restructuring, 
  their respective sons, Michael and Howard, would manage the family businesses. 
  Paul and his wife, Geri (she died on October 28, 1991) established trusts in 
  favour of their children, namely the Michael Trust and the Jodi Trust, intended 
  to benefit their children and their issue. In 1992 and 1993, Paul executed new 
  wills for assets on the subject of the trusts in which Jodi and Michael (and 
  their issue) were the beneficiaries. Following a family meeting in August 1993 
  which was intended to explain the objectives and particulars of the corporate 
  and estate planning structure, the relationship between Jodi and Paul, for various 
  reasons, started to deteriorate. On November 25, 1996, Paul executed a new will 
  and disinherited Jodi and her children because of his displeasure over Jodi's 
  and Steven's (her husband) conduct. </p>
<p>
  [4] Attempts to reach a financial settlement under which the Edell family would 
  agree to separate themselves from the financial affairs of the other members 
  of the Sitzer family failed and this litigation was commenced. On January 6, 
  1998, Paul encroached on the Jodi Trust in favour of Michael.</p>
<p>
  [5] The trial judge was required to decide between conflicting evidence and 
  credibility was a central issue. In detailed and considered reasons, the trial 
  judge found Paul to be a credible witness and that his evidence, where it conflicts 
  with that of Jodi or Stephen, should generally be accepted. In some instances, 
  he specifically disbelieved their evidence. </p>
<p>
  [6] The appellants' recitation of the facts in this appeal ignores the extensive 
  findings made by the trial judge. The appellants have identified evidence that 
  was presented at trial that they suggest might indicate different conclusions. 
  </p>
<p>
  The Mutual Will Issue</p>
<p>
  [7] On August 27, 1984, Paul and his wife, Geri, had executed separate but similar 
  wills. The beneficiaries were their two children, Jodi and Michael. At trial, 
  the appellants alleged that these were mutual wills and that Paul was prohibited 
  from varying the estate plan found in Paul's will. </p>
<p>
  [8] After a thorough review of the evidence and the applicable jurisprudence, 
  the trial judge found that there was no contract, or other agreement between 
  Paul and Geri that restricted the survivor of them from varying the estate planning 
  arrangements or from dealing freely with his or her own property or making new 
  wills as they pleased. The trial judge accepted Paul's evidence that he would 
  never have entered into such an agreement. Accordingly, the trial judge concluded 
  that the requirements of an application of the rules governing mutual wills 
  were not satisfied.</p>
<p>
  [9] The trial judge also found that Paul has not constituted himself a trustee 
  over his personal assets and that there was no evidence of an express trust 
  and no basis to impose a constructive trust in Jodi's favour. The evidence failed 
  to establish that Paul and Geri had entered into an irrevocable agreement or 
  made promises or representations to the effect that each of their children would 
  receive assets of equal value upon the death of their parents. </p>
<p>
  [10] The trial judge made no error in his analysis of the standard or legal 
  requirements for the doctrine of mutual wills to apply. His findings that Paul 
  and Geri did not agree to execute mutual wills and that there was no basis to 
  impose a trust over any of Paul's assets are amply supported by the evidence. 
  </p>
<p>
  The Jodi Trust</p>
<p>
  [11] Paul and Geri were the trustees of the Jodi Trust. After considering the 
  purpose of the estate freeze and the creation of the Jodi Trust, the trial judge 
  found a clear intention that control of the destination of the income and capital 
  of the trust money was to be retained by the trustees until the trust was terminated. 
  The trial judge correctly concluded that the words of the trust instrument authorized 
  the trustees to encroach in favour of Michael.</p>
<p>
  [12] The trial judge specifically found that Paul's displeasure and disapproval 
  of Jodi's conduct were not considerations that contributed materially to his 
  decision. Rather, the trial judge concluded that Paul encroached only when Jodi's 
  behaviour led him to conclude that Jodi's ownership of equity of the family 
  businesses would be ruinous to them and, in consequence, detrimental to his 
  descendants as well as to the descendants of Sidney.</p>
<p>
  [13] Accordingly, the trial judge concluded that Paul's exercise of his power 
  of encroachment in Michael's favour should not be interfered with because it 
  was exercised in good faith and not for any improper purpose. Once again, this 
  is a finding of fact that is amply supported by the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [14] In our view, the detailed findings of fact made by the trial judge, which 
  include specific findings grounded in credibility assessments, are well supported 
  by the evidence. This court is being asked to reject the trial judge's findings 
  of fact, reweigh the evidence and substitute new findings of fact. This is not 
  the role of this court. No overriding and palpable errors, as these terms are 
  defined in the authorities, have been demonstrated. Nothing in the appellants' 
  submissions warrants this court's reconsideration of the trial decision. </p>
<p>
  [15] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $35,000 for the 
  respondents Paul Sitzer, Paul Sitzer Holdings Limited and Geraldine Sitzer Holdings 
  Ltd., and $25,000 for the respondent Michael Sitzer, both amounts inclusive 
  of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
