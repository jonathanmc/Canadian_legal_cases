<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John deP. Wright of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated January 29, 2003. </p>
<p>
  ABELLA J.A. (Dissenting as to the apportionment of liability against James Prystay): </p>
<p>
  [1] This appeal involves the tragic and accidental shooting of thirteen year 
  old Ryan Eichmanis by his fifteen year old friend Ryan Prystay. The issue in 
  this appeal is whether the trial judge's apportionment of liability should be 
  disturbed. </p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [2] Ryan Prystay's ("Prystay") parents separated when he was three 
  years old. He lived with his mother, Tracey Lauersen, until he was fifteen. 
  He moved in with his father, James Prystay, in December 1997, as a result of 
  the untenable conflict between him and his mother's new husband. </p>
<p>
  [3] By the time Prystay moved into his father's house, his relationship with 
  his mother was so estranged that he had little contact with her. She was removed 
  from his school's contact list and no longer received any information about 
  his attendance or report cards. </p>
<p>
  [4] In spring of 1998, Prystay's father was told by his employer that he had 
  to attend an alcohol rehabilitation centre for three weeks in order to keep 
  his job. He did not want his fifteen year old son living alone while he was 
  away. As Prystay did not want to stay with his mother, his father urged his 
  brother, Prystay's uncle John Prystay, to permit Prystay to stay with him, his 
  wife Catherine, and their baby. Catherine Prystay was unhappy about the arrangement, 
  but accepted it because she was under the impression that it would only be for 
  a few days. </p>
<p>
  [5] When James Prystay went to the rehabilitation centre, he took his son's 
  key away and instructed him not to enter his house while he was gone. The family 
  dog was to remain at the home to be cared for by the tenants who lived upstairs. 
  </p>
<p>
  [6] Despite these instructions, Prystay entered the house. On one occasion, 
  he called his aunt from there. She recognized the telephone number on call display 
  and phoned his mother who, in turn, immediately phoned Prystay and told him 
  to return to his aunt's house. He complied with his mother's request. </p>
<p>
  [7] Almost one week after Prystay began living at his aunt's and uncle's house, 
  the aunt, who sometimes drove him to school, called the school to inform them 
  that Prystay would be late that morning. The school informed her that Prystay 
  had not been in attendance for several months. This resulted in the aunt and 
  uncle telling Prystay he had to go to school, an admonition he accepted and 
  followed. </p>
<p>
  [8] On the day of the accident, June 12, 1998, Prystay had been living with 
  his aunt and uncle for about 10 days. On that day, Prystay was driven to school 
  by his aunt and wrote an exam. Prystay and two friends, including Ryan Eichmanis 
  ("Eichmanis"), went to Prystay's father's home around 1:00 p.m. Prystay 
  broke into the house and let the other boys in through the front door. They 
  went to Prystay's bedroom. There were approximately a dozen marijuana plants, 
  two firearms, and ammunition scattered throughout the room and the rest of the 
  house. </p>
<p>
  [9] Eichmanis was playing with one of the firearms, a .22 calibre rifle, and 
  initially pointed it at Prystay, but then put it down. Prystay was holding the 
  other firearm, a 20?gauge shotgun. He backed up against the wall, accidentally 
  discharging the gun. Eichmanis was hit in the abdomen above his right hip and 
  was critically injured. </p>
<p>
  [10] Eichmanis spent six weeks at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto 
  where he underwent major surgery and completed six months of physiotherapy. 
  His injuries are permanent and serious. </p>
<p>
  [11] When the police arrived at the father's home in response to a 911 call, 
  they saw cushions which seemed to be shot with bullets, empty .22 shell casings, 
  ammunition, and scorch marks from burned gunpowder. In the father's bedroom 
  closet, they found a leather bullet belt with seven live shotgun shells. </p>
<p>
  [12] In Prystay's bedroom, they saw both live and fired ammunition, a large 
  hunting knife, graffiti on the wall, matches, Marilyn Manson posters on the 
  walls, green plant material on the floor, and burn marks on the floor from gunpowder. 
  </p>
<p>
  [13] Eichmanis and his parents brought an action for damages against Prystay, 
  his father, mother, uncle, and aunt. The plaintiffs, collectively, conceded 
  contributory liability to the extent of 25%. </p>
<p>
  [14] The trial judge assessed damages at $1,066,500. He failed to attribute 
  any negligence to Prystay's mother, aunt, or uncle, but apportioned the remaining 
  75% liability to Prystay at 50% and his father at 25%.</p>
<p>
  [15] This appeal by the Eichmanis family is from that apportionment. </p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [16] The appellants argued that the uncle, aunt and mother should have known 
  there were guns in the father's house and, therefore, had a duty to inspect 
  it when they knew Prystay had gone there despite explicit instructions to the 
  contrary.</p>
<p>
  [17] The general principles governing parental negligence are referred to by 
  Allen M. Linden in Canadian Tort Law, 7th ed. (Markham: Butterworths, 2001) 
  at 136 where he cites Lelarge et al. v. Blakney et al. (1978), 92 D.L.R. (3d) 
  440 at 447 (N.B.C.A.): </p>
<p class="indent">
  The [parental] duty [of care] is to supervise and control the activities of 
  the child and, in doing so, to use reasonable care to prevent foreseeable damage 
  to others. The extent of the duty varies with the age of the child. </p>
<p>
  [18] Foreseeability is a key component in assessing whether the care was reasonable 
  in the circumstances (G.H.L. Fridman, The Law of Torts in Canada, 2nd. ed. (Toronto: 
  Carswell, 2002) at 388). The standard of care must take into account any evidence 
  of whether the parents were aware of any dangerous activity or propensity on 
  the part of the child and whether, knowing of this possibility, failed to take 
  reasonable steps to avoid its manifestation. </p>
<p>
  [19] These relevant factors can be summarized as including the child's age; 
  the nature of the activity and its potential dangerousness; and the parent's 
  knowledge of prior dangerous acts or tendencies. </p>
<p>
  [20] In my view, the trial judge's reasons reflect the proper legal principles 
  and their appropriate application to the facts, despite the absence of explicit 
  references to some of the guiding concepts. There was sufficient evidence upon 
  which he could reasonably have concluded that Prystay's mother, aunt and uncle 
  had not breached the requisite standard of care, that Prystay's father was less 
  liable than his son, and that the greatest share of responsibility should be 
  attributed to Prystay in these circumstances. </p>
<p>
  Tracey Lauersen (Mother)</p>
<p>
  [21] The Eichmanis family argued that the trial judge erred in finding that 
  Prystay's mother, Tracey Lauersen, had satisfied the onus set out in s. 68 of 
  the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F-3 which requires a parent to show that 
  he or she has exercised "reasonable supervision and control over the child". 
  Section 68 states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In an action against a parent for damages to property or for personal injury 
  or death caused by the fault or neglect of a child who is a minor, the onus 
  of establishing that the parent exercised reasonable supervision and control 
  over the child rests with the parent. </p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge was satisfied that Prystay's mother had met the onus because, 
  in circumstances the trial judge found to be reasonable, she had transferred 
  the supervision of her son to his father six months earlier and subsequently, 
  through his father, to his aunt and uncle. She told the aunt and uncle to call 
  her if they had a problem. </p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge determined, in essence, that the mother exercised what 
  could be considered reasonable supervision and control over Prystay given her 
  relationship with him at the time. He concluded that the fact that she still 
  had technical legal custody of Prystay was not determinative.</p>
<p>
  [24] The applicable standard of appellate review of a trial judge's finding 
  of negligence was described in Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at 
  245 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A proposition that should be unnecessary to state is that a court of appeal 
  should not interfere with a trial judge's reasons unless there is a palpable 
  and overriding error. The same proposition is sometimes stated as prohibiting 
  an appellate court from reviewing a trial judge's decision if there was some 
  evidence upon which he or she could have relied to reach that conclusion [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [25] I see no such palpable and overriding error justifying interference with 
  the trial judge's findings. Prystay was explicit in his discovery testimony 
  that he had no desire to live with his mother or to have anything to do with 
  her at that point in his life. He was adamant about not returning to live with 
  her and her new husband. </p>
<p>
  [26] Prystay's mother's evidence was that apart from his conflicted relationship 
  with his step-father, and some minor incidents at school, he exhibited no behavioral 
  problems. Given his age, the tensions with his stepfather, and his determined 
  resistance, the mother acted reasonably in permitting Prystay to stay with his 
  aunt and uncle while his father was at the rehabilitation facility. </p>
<p>
  [27] Tracey Lauersen and James Prystay had been divorced for 12 years at the 
  time of the accident. The trial judge found that Prystay's mother had no knowledge 
  that he was playing with firearms or that there were any available in his father's 
  home. She was not in a position to know what the contents of her ex-husband's 
  home were, nor did she have a key or access to the house while he was away. 
  When she attended James Prystay's house two months prior to the accident, she 
  saw no evidence of guns or ammunition. The only knowledge she had about dangerous 
  items was that James Prystay had owned a gun 12 years earlier. </p>
<p>
  [28] In addition, Prystay testified on discovery that not only had he never 
  told his mother about the guns and the ammunition at his father's home, he deliberately 
  withheld this information from her because he knew she would have "[done] 
  something". </p>
<p>
  [29] Having found as a fact that Prystay's mother did not know that he had access 
  to any dangerous items in his father's house, and given the reality of the nature 
  of her relationship with her son when the accident happened and his unwillingness 
  to subject himself to her supervision, the trial judge was entitled to conclude 
  that Ms. Lauersen did not breach the requisite standard of care.</p>
<p>
  Catherine Prystay (Aunt)</p>
<p>
  [30] The appellants argued that the trial judge erred in failing to apply the 
  standard of care of a reasonable parent to John and Cathy Prystay. They acknowledge 
  that in accordance with Housen, the standard of care in a negligence action 
  involves a question of mixed fact and law and is therefore entitled to deference 
  on appellate review. However, they assert that because the trial judge failed 
  to use the words "standard of a reasonable and prudent parent" in 
  his reasons in connection with the aunt and uncle, this reflects a sufficient 
  error that this court is entitled to reconsider the evidence and substitute 
  its own findings. </p>
<p>
  [31] In my view, read as a whole, the trial judge's reasons disclose no such 
  error. The trial judge was entitled to find that given the temporary nature 
  of Prystay's stay with them, and their relationship with him, the aunt and uncle 
  exercised reasonable care and supervision in the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [32] Prior to Prystay coming to stay with them, the aunt and uncle rarely saw 
  Prystay or his father. The aunt believed that she was dealing with "a decent 
  young man who was amenable to direction". She took reasonable steps to 
  supervise him when problems were brought to her attention. When she discovered 
  that Prystay was not attending school, she phoned both his father and mother. 
  She enforced a 10:00 p.m. curfew, admonished him to attend school, and told 
  him that he was not allowed to smoke in the house. </p>
<p>
  [33] She had no knowledge of guns or their availability on the father's premises. 
  </p>
<p>
  [34] The trial judge found that there was little, if anything, that the aunt 
  could have done to prevent the accident. She had no reason to believe that dangerous 
  weapons were on the father's premises, let alone that they were accessible to 
  Prystay, or that he would disregard the clear and repeated instructions from 
  his father, mother, uncle and herself not to enter his father's home. </p>
<p>
  [35] Given her tenuous relationship with Prystay, the temporary nature of his 
  stay with her, and the fact that she had no knowledge about any dangerous propensities 
  or access to weapons, I agree with the trial judge that she did all that she 
  could be expected to do and that she exercised reasonable care and supervision 
  in the circumstances. </p>
<p>
  John Prystay (Uncle)</p>
<p>
  [36] There was no evidence that the uncle knew that a gun was in his brother's 
  home at the time of the accident, despite a finding to the contrary by the trial 
  judge which, with respect, is not supported by the evidence. The uncle's only 
  evidence on this point was that he and his brother were given guns one Christmas 
  as teenagers. </p>
<p>
  [37] The trial judge found that the doors to the father's house were locked 
  and that the uncle had the key. He found that there was no evidence that the 
  uncle knew that Prystay was going back to his father's house, or that he was 
  playing with guns. </p>
<p>
  [38] The appellants argued that the trial judge erred in finding that the uncle 
  did not know that Prystay had been in the house. Their position is that at some 
  point before the accident, the uncle spoke to the tenants and directed them 
  not to let Prystay into the house again. Rather than attracting liability, however, 
  I see the uncle's instruction to the tenants as a reasonable response by him 
  in the circumstances. It was also reasonable for the uncle to assume that once 
  this means of entry was eliminated, Prystay would not return to the house. There 
  is no evidence that the uncle knew of any potential for dangerousness on Prystay's 
  part, nor did he have any basis for anticipating - or any way of preventing 
  - Prystay breaking into his father's house. </p>
<p>
  [39] Most significantly, there is no evidence that the uncle knew that weapons 
  and ammunition were in the house or stored unsafely. The trial judge was entitled, 
  therefore, to conclude that no "duty to inspect" the father's home 
  arose in circumstances where there was no evidence that any adult other than 
  the father knew of guns in the house, let alone that Prystay used them.</p>
<p>
  [40] The appellants argued, however, that since the uncle did not testify at 
  trial, the trial judge ought to have drawn the adverse inference that he knew 
  both that Prystay was going back to his father's home and that there was a risk 
  that he would be playing with guns there. </p>
<p>
  [41] The trial judge had some of the uncle's evidence from his examination for 
  discovery. Moreover, the appellants concede that there was no need for the uncle 
  to testify unless a prima facie case against him had been made out. No such 
  case was established. The aunt was not asked directly on discovery if she told 
  her husband about the call-display incident. </p>
<p>
  [42] In the absence of any evidence that the uncle knew that his brother had 
  guns in the house or that they were stored unsafely, there was no basis for 
  concluding that the uncle breached the requisite standard of care by failing 
  to inspect the house.</p>
<p>
  [43] Prystay broke into the home he lived in with his father notwithstanding 
  instructions from his uncle, aunt, and mother not to attend at the house. There 
  was no evidence that any of those three adults knew of any propensity on Prystay's 
  part for playing with guns or other weapons, or had any other information about 
  his potential for dangerousness which would have led them to be more vigilant 
  about him. The conduct of which the mother was aware included difficulties at 
  school, such as absenteeism and drinking, an incident where he forged a letter 
  to a girl in his class, and a turbulent relationship with his stepfather. This 
  conduct cannot by any standard be said to lead a reasonable adult, or even a 
  reasonable parent, to a heightened state of attentiveness for the possibilities 
  of dangerous conduct, let alone firearm use. </p>
<p>
  [44] Based on what the mother, aunt and uncle knew and, significantly, what 
  they did not know about the presence of guns, it was open to the trial judge 
  to conclude that there was nothing more they could be expected to do. There 
  was no evidence that could lead a reasonable person in the mother's, aunt's, 
  or uncle's position to conclude that there was any risk of dangerousness related 
  to Prystay's forbidden presence in his father's house. </p>
<p>
  [45] In summary, there was nothing about Prystay's conduct to alert any one 
  of these three adults, all of whom acted in good faith, to any prospect of danger. 
  The mother was not living with her son and had limited ability to control his 
  physical actions. Her son had distanced himself from her once he began living 
  with his father. The aunt and uncle, in an attempt to help the father, were 
  temporarily responsible for a teenaged boy they had little personal knowledge 
  about.</p>
<p>
  [46] In any event, Prystay's mother, aunt and uncle all took reasonable steps 
  in the circumstances. These included the aunt making arrangements for Prystay 
  to return to school when she learned of his absenteeism; her telling the mother 
  of the absenteeism and of Prystay's visit to his father's house; the mother's 
  immediate response to the aunt's call, which included scolding Prystay and giving 
  him firm instructions to return to his aunt's house; the uncle's instructions 
  to the tenants that they should not let Prystay enter the house; and the aunt 
  and the uncle ensuring that Prystay did indeed go to school by driving him to 
  school, including on the day of the accident. Considering that they did not 
  know of any potential for danger or of the presence of firearms, there is little 
  else they could have done. </p>
<p>
  [47] The trial judge was therefore entitled to find that the shooting accident 
  was not foreseeable by Prystay's aunt, uncle, or mother and, given the reality 
  of their respective relationships with him, that they exercised reasonable supervision 
  and control in the circumstances. There was clearly "some evidence", 
  as stipulated in Housen, from which the trial judge could have come to his conclusion 
  that these three adults should not be liable for Eichmanis' injuries. </p>
<p>
  James Prystay (Father)</p>
<p>
  [48] The appellants submit that the trial judge's apportionment of 25% liability 
  to the father was too low. </p>
<p>
  [49] The trial judge made no reference to the father's conduct other than to 
  his criminal conviction for the unsafe storage of a firearm. The father had 
  pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six months to be served as a conditional 
  sentence. </p>
<p>
  [50] While it would have been preferable for the trial judge to have provided 
  more explicit reasons for his conclusions, in my view a review of the record, 
  despite minor errors, demonstrates no serious misappreciation of the evidence 
  or of the relevant law.</p>
<p>
  [51] James Prystay did not defend this action. There is no dispute that he owned 
  the firearms and the ammunition that ultimately injured Eichmanis and that he 
  knew of his son's interest in guns. Prystay found the shotgun with bullets in 
  the ammunition belt in his father's closet and the rifle in his father's garage. 
  Prystay was allowed to have access to these guns by his father and to store 
  them on a gun rack in his bedroom along with various kinds of ammunition. </p>
<p>
  [52] Eichmanis' testimony was that the first time he went to Prystay's house, 
  the father was home and the guns were on the gun rack in Prystay's bedroom. 
  The appellants argued that since the father knew of their presence in the home 
  and his son's easy access to them, it was insufficient for the father simply 
  to have taken his key away and instructed him not to attend the house. Moreover, 
  the appellants assert, the father ought to have foreseen that his son would 
  be concerned about the dog remaining in the house and might attempt to visit 
  it. </p>
<p>
  [53] There was a sound basis for finding the father negligent. He kept weapons 
  and ammunition in his home without taking steps to secure their safe storage 
  before he entered the rehabilitation clinic. </p>
<p>
  [54] These were weapons with potential for fatal harm. There is no evidence 
  that he told his brother or sister-in-law of his son's interest in weapons or 
  even that there were weapons in the house. He took no steps to store the ammunition 
  or the firearms safely while he was away from the house, notwithstanding that 
  he knew he would not be able to supervise his son for a period of at least three 
  weeks. This irresponsible conduct by the father amply supports the trial judge's 
  conclusion that the father was negligent. </p>
<p>
  [55] On the other hand, there was no evidence that the father was told, or ought 
  to have foreseen, that his son would break into the house in defiance of his 
  authority. It was open to the trial judge in these circumstances to find that 
  despite the father's acknowledged negligence in not properly storing the weapons, 
  his adolescent son, in violating his father's, mother's and uncle's clear and 
  repeated instructions not to enter his home, and in pointing a loaded gun at 
  his friend, was substantially more responsible for the accident than his father. 
  </p>
<p>
  [56] James Prystay had few options for his son's care while he was away, and 
  his decision to have his son stay with his aunt and uncle was, in the circumstances, 
  reasonable and responsible. Prystay, according to the evidence, had presented 
  no significant behavioural problems for his father. Prystay testified in his 
  examination for discovery that his father did not know that he was shooting 
  the .22 in the house. It is true that the father could have alerted the adults 
  to whom he assigned his son's care to the presence of guns in the home. But 
  in the absence of any evidence that he knew that his son had returned to his 
  home contrary to his instructions, or that he had any basis for anticipating 
  that he would do so, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that a duty 
  to alert the aunt and uncle did not arise. </p>
<p>
  [57] The apportionment of liability by a trial judge should not be interfered 
  with unless there is "demonstrable error in the trial judge's appreciation 
  of the facts or applicable legal principles" (Ingles v. Tutkaluk Construction 
  Ltd., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 298 at 338, per Bastarache J.). Similarly, as noted by 
  this court in Hague v. Billings (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 298 at 303 (C.A.), citing 
  Sparks v. Thompson, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 618, a "very strong and exceptional 
  case is required before an appellate court should interfere with and vary the 
  degrees of fault fixed by a trial judge". </p>
<p>
  [58] This was not a young child. Prystay was, as the trial judge found, "a 
  15 year old boy who was intelligent, who had received some firearms training 
  with the cadets, who knew better". It was, therefore, open to the trial 
  judge to attribute the greatest responsibility for this tragedy to Prystay.</p>
<p>
  [59] In my view, it cannot be said that in these circumstances an apportionment 
  of 25% liability is so manifest an error as to be interfered with. </p>
<p>
  [60] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. On consent, all the cross-appeals 
  were withdrawn before the hearing of the appeal. In the circumstances, I would 
  not make an order for costs.</p>
<p> RELEASED: "R.S. Abella J.A.""RSA APR -6 2004"</p>
<p>
  CRONK J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [61] I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of my colleague, 
  Abella J.A. For the reasons expressed by her, and on the record before us, I 
  agree that there is no basis on which to disturb the trial judge's apportionment 
  of liability concerning Ryan Prystay's mother, aunt and uncle. With respect, 
  however, I disagree with Abella J.A.'s conclusion that this appeal should be 
  dismissed in connection with the trial judge's assessment of the degree of fault 
  of James Prystay (James), Ryan Prystay's father.</p>
<p>
  [62] On the basis of the trial judge's reasons for judgment, I am unable to 
  conclude that he conducted a proper negligence analysis concerning James. In 
  particular, for the reasons that follow, I believe that the trial judge erred 
  in restricting James' negligence to only one factor. Accordingly, I am of the 
  opinion that James' proportionate liability should have been higher. </p>
<p>
  (1) Trial Judge's Apportionment of Liability</p>
<p> [63] The background facts to the tragic accident in this case are set out 
  in the reasons of Abella J.A. and need not be repeated. This appeal concerns 
  the issue of the trial judge's apportionment of liability. That apportionment 
  was as follows: </p>
<table width="50%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">

    <td width="78%"> 
      <p>Ryan Prystay (Ryan):</p>

    <td class="rightalign" width="22%">100%</td>
  </tr>

<p>
  [64] It is important to emphasize that the appellants conceded at trial that 
  they should bear 25% responsibility for the serious injuries sustained by Eichmanis. 
  Although the trial judge stated in his reasons that this concession related 
  only to Eichmanis himself, it is not contested on this appeal that the concession 
  concerned all the appellants, as a group.</p>
<p>
  (2) Standard of Review</p>
<p>
  [65] Abella J.A. set out in her reasons the test for appellate review of the 
  apportionment of liability by a trial judge in a negligence case. This test 
  is an exacting one. An appellate court may only intervene where error in the 
  trial judge's appreciation of the facts or applicable legal principles has been 
  demonstrated. As this court recently stated in Banihashem-Bakhtiari v. Axes 
  Investments Inc., [2004] O.J. No. 302 at para. 8, "A re-apportionment of 
  liability sought on appeal will only be granted in strong and exceptional cases."</p>
<p>
  (3) James: Ryan's Father</p>
<p>
  [66] I agree with Abella J.A. that parents owe a duty to exercise reasonable 
  supervision and control over their children and that, in discharging that duty, 
  they are obliged to use reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm to their 
  children or others. With respect, however, I do not agree with Abella J.A.'s 
  conclusion that the trial judge's reasons reflect the proper legal principles 
  and their proper application to the facts of this case in relation to James.</p>
<p>
  [67] James did not defend this action and was noted in default at an early stage 
  of the litigation. </p>
<p>
  [68] The trial judge's reasons concerning James' negligence and his degree of 
  culpability were limited to two brief paragraphs. At the beginning of his reasons, 
  the trial judge noted that James had not defended the action and held that James 
  was liable for "negligence in his storing of the gun [sic] and ammunition". 
  Later in his reasons, when apportioning liability, the trial judge stated (at 
  para. 24): </p>
<p class="indent"> As to the relative negligence between the father and the two 
  boys I find the father 25% negligent.</p>
<p class="indent">It is true that he advised his son that the son was not to go 
  to the home, that he locked the house and the boy did not have a key but the 
  civil law must follow the criminal law requirements with respect to the storage 
  of firearms. Under the Regulations respecting the Storage, Display, Transportation 
  and Handling of Firearms by Individuals SOR/98-209 firearms must be rendered 
  inoperable and ammunition stored in a secure manner other than with the firearm[s]. 
  Failure to abide by these regulations must attract civil liability if that failure 
  is a cause of damage. In this case it was.</p>
<p>
  [69] The trial judge's apportionment of 25% liability to James was based solely 
  on James' failure to comply with the applicable legal requirements concerning 
  the safe storage of the firearms and the ammunition in his home. This failure 
  weighs heavily in the analysis of James' negligence and the determination of 
  his contributory liability. Similarly, the trial judge's findings that James 
  directed Ryan not to go to his home while he was absent, that James had locked 
  the house on his departure, and that Ryan did not have a key to James' house 
  are important factual underpinnings for the determination of an appropriate 
  percentage of liability for James.</p>
<p>
  [70] However, these are not the only factors relevant to the assessment of James' 
  degree of fault in the circumstances. The reasons of the trial judge indicate 
  that he failed to consider all the evidence of James' conduct that supports 
  the assignment to James of a higher percentage of liability. This evidence may 
  be summarized as follows.</p>
<p>
  (a) Evidence Concerning the Guns and the Ammunition</p>
<p>
  [71] The evidence at trial established that James allowed Ryan to retain a .22 
  calibre semi-automatic rifle, which Ryan found in the garage at James' home. 
  As well, James kept his own .20 gauge shotgun and an ammunition belt, containing 
  unfired bullets, in the unlocked closet of the master bedroom in his house. 
  Thus, although the trial judge referred to "the gun" and the ammunition 
  in James' home, there were two guns in the house: the .22 calibre rifle, which 
  Ryan treated as his own, and the .20 gauge shotgun, which belonged to James. 
  </p>
<p>
  [72] There is no suggestion that James took any steps to prevent access by Ryan 
  to either of these guns or the ammunition. To the contrary, James permitted 
  Ryan to display both guns on a gun rack in Ryan's bedroom. Neither gun had a 
  safety mechanism or trigger locks. No proof was offered at trial that James 
  instructed his son on the safe handling and use of these weapons, or that he 
  sought to control their use by Ryan.</p>
<p>
  [73] It is true, as observed by Abella J.A. in her reasons, that Ryan testified 
  on discovery that his father did not know that he was firing the .22 calibre 
  rifle in the house. However, James did know that Ryan played with the guns in 
  the house. </p>
<p>
  [74] Nonetheless, when he arranged for Ryan to stay with them during his absence, 
  James failed to inform his brother and his sister-in-law of Ryan's propensity 
  to play with guns. Moreover, and importantly, he failed to tell them that there 
  were guns and ammunition in his house; nor did he take any steps to remove the 
  guns or the ammunition from the house while he was away, although this could 
  easily have been accomplished as, for example, by requesting that his brother 
  remove the guns and secure them in a safe place. Apart from locking the door 
  of the house, telling his son not to go to the house in his absence, and retrieving 
  a key to the house from Ryan, James did nothing to secure the guns and the ammunition 
  in the house or to prevent Ryan's access to them.</p>
<p>
  [75] James' actions concerning the guns and the ammunition demonstrate more 
  than a failure to abide by applicable regulations concerning their safe storage. 
  His conduct showed a complete disregard for the inherent dangers posed by the 
  guns and the ammunition in their existing condition, for the proper supervision 
  and control of his son in relation to the guns and the ammunition, and for the 
  safety and well-being of his son and others who could come into contact with 
  the guns and the ammunition during James' absence.</p>
<p>
  (b) Ryan's Behaviour </p>
<p>
  [76] The evidence also paints a disturbing picture of a general lack of supervision 
  and control of Ryan's behaviour and activities by his father while Ryan was 
  living with him, up to and including the point when James undertook rehabilitation 
  for his alcohol problems.</p>
<p>
  [77] Ryan kept a large assortment of bullets, some fired and others unfired, 
  in a dresser drawer in his bedroom prior to the shooting incident. As well, 
  bullets were strewn all over his bedroom. Ryan testified on his discovery that 
  he had a "whole whack of shells, all different kinds" that he collected 
  when he was living with his father, some of which were "empties" while 
  others were "full", and that they were thrown in his drawer and "around" 
  his room. He said that, "some of them were on the floor, in the grate in 
  the floor, everywhere".</p>
<p>
  [78] Ryan was also growing marijuana in his bedroom in about a dozen pots.</p>
<p>
  [79] When the police entered James' house on the day of the accident involving 
  Eichmanis, they discovered Ryan's room in a complete state of disarray. His 
  clothes and books were strewn about; the walls were defaced and damaged by graffiti, 
  burn marks and stab marks; and shotgun wadding (fibre wads) and fired and unfired 
  bullet shell casings were found throughout the room. A police officer testified 
  at trial that Ryan's room "looked like a very abused room, not well kept". 
  Ryan said that, "My whole room was a mess."</p>
<p>
  [80] The police also observed that the wood floor and baseboards in the house 
  were seared with burn marks. Ryan candidly told the police that the marks were 
  caused by his occasional practice of whittling out the lead from bullets, pouring 
  the gunpowder on the wood floor, and causing it to ignite. Ryan did not suggest 
  that this practice commenced only after his father entered the rehabilitation 
  centre. To the contrary, he testified on his discovery that prior to the accident 
  involving Eichmanis, one of Ryan's friends discharged the shotgun in the house 
  and taught Ryan how to remove the lead from various bullets.</p>
<p>
  [81] As well, Ryan himself had discharged the rifle and had shot at a toolbox 
  in the house. Although his father did not know that he had fired the rifle in 
  the house, Ryan kept the damaged toolbox in the house and thought that his father 
  had seen it.</p>
<p>
  [82] The police also recovered numerous .22 calibre bullet shell casings and 
  fibre wads from the living room floor and elsewhere in James' house, including 
  from the kitchen and the hallway. As well, both fired and unfired shotgun shell 
  casings were discovered in numerous locations in Ryan's bedroom.</p>
<p>
  [83] The appellants submit that the extent of the chaos in Ryan's room and James' 
  house realistically could not have been occasioned in only a few days. I agree.</p>
<p>
  [84] It is also noteworthy that shortly after Ryan began residing with his aunt 
  and uncle, his aunt learned inadvertently that Ryan had been absent from school 
  for most of the spring school semester. He was living with his father throughout 
  that period.</p>
<p>
  [85] This evidence indicates a pattern of inattentiveness by James to his son's 
  behaviour and activities over a prolonged period. I believe that it clearly 
  demonstrates that James furnished little meaningful supervision and control 
  over Ryan while Ryan was living with him.</p>
<p>
  (c) Arrangements Concerning Ryan's Care</p>
<p>
  [86] Furthermore, James' arrangements for Ryan's care while James was in the 
  rehabilitation centre were deficient in several important respects.</p>
<p>
  [87] As I have previously indicated, when John and Catherine agreed to allow 
  Ryan to stay with them, James did not inform them that there were guns and ammunition 
  in his home; nor did he tell them of Ryan's past practice of playing with the 
  guns. These omissions left John and Catherine unaware that the contents of James' 
  home posed a potential hazard to Ryan and others if Ryan attended at the home, 
  unsupervised, while James was absent. Indeed, the potential danger to others 
  existed even if Ryan did not disobey his father and his uncle by attending at 
  the house. If James' home had been broken into during his absence, unsecured 
  guns and ammunition were readily available. They were also available to the 
  upstairs tenants at James' house, who had a key to James' premises.</p>
<p>
  [88] James' failure to disclose these matters to Ryan's caregivers, John and 
  Catherine, is significant for an additional reason. Since Ryan had displayed 
  interest in and had played with the guns in the past, their uncontrolled presence 
  in James' house could attract Ryan to the house while his father was away. The 
  likelihood of this possibility was strengthened by the fact that James left 
  his dog, to which Ryan was known to be attached, alone at his house to be cared 
  for by the upstairs tenants. Ryan's mother testified that Ryan did not want 
  the tenants to look after the dog. As well, most of Ryan's personal possessions 
  and clothes were left at James' house when James departed. Consequently, James 
  permitted a situation to be created in which Ryan would be strongly attracted 
  to his father's house while James was away, notwithstanding directions to Ryan 
  that he not go to the house.</p>
<p>
  [89] James also did not tell Ryan how long he was to stay with his aunt and 
  uncle, although Ryan had never been inside their home before and had spent little 
  time with them previously. As well, James did not discuss or inquire after Ryan's 
  progress at his relatives' home at any point while he was at the rehabilitation 
  centre. In addition, James had no discussion with his sister-in-law regarding 
  Ryan's care or supervision before he departed for the rehabilitation centre. 
  He also did not contact his son directly at any point while Ryan was residing 
  with his aunt and his uncle, although James spoke with his brother and asked 
  to meet with his sister-in-law.</p>
<p>
  [90] Finally, as I have said, James left a key to his house with the upstairs 
  tenants, rather than with his brother, sister-in-law or former wife. On at least 
  one occasion while James was at the rehabilitation centre, the tenants allowed 
  Ryan to access his father's house. As well, although there was some evidence 
  indicating that James had retrieved a key to the house from Ryan before entering 
  the rehabilitation facility, Ryan kept another house key in his bedroom. He 
  retrieved this key when he broke into his father's house shortly after taking 
  up residence with his aunt and his uncle and used it to gain access to the house.</p>
<p>
  [91] It does not appear that the trial judge took most of this evidence into 
  account in apportioning liability. Instead, he fixed James' percentage share 
  of liability based on one factor only, that is, James' failure to properly store 
  the gun[s] and the ammunition in his home. Although that factor is clearly central 
  to the assessment of James' degree of culpability, the evidence of James' conduct 
  as a whole is also critical to that assessment.</p>
<p>
  [92] Viewed as a whole, the evidence concerning James' conduct indicates carelessness 
  and a lack of diligence by him concerning Ryan's supervision and control for 
  an extended time, both prior to and during Ryan's stay with his aunt and his 
  uncle. It demonstrates that James' house was a site for "an accident waiting 
  to happen". Tragically, that accident occurred. It was entirely foreseeable 
  to James. </p>
<p>
  [93] In these circumstances, I conclude that it is appropriate that James assume 
  a greater portion of liability. In my opinion, had the trial judge considered 
  the whole of the relevant evidence regarding James' conduct and measured it 
  against James' duty to supervise and control Ryan, as in my view the trial judge 
  was obliged to do, a higher attribution of percentage liability inevitably would 
  have been held to attach to James. </p>
<p>
  [94] Taking into account the full extent of James' responsibility for the severe 
  injuries suffered by Eichmanis, what degree of fault should properly be assigned 
  to him?</p>
<p>
  [95] I agree, as conceded by the appellants at trial, that Eichmanis and his 
  parents were contributorily negligent. Based on that concession, the trial judge 
  did not err in attributing 25% liability to them.</p>
<p>
  [96] I also agree with the trial judge's conclusion that a fifteen year old 
  boy must be accountable for his actions. For the reasons expressed by Abella 
  J.A., with which I concur, Ryan must bear significant responsibility for the 
  injuries sustained by Eichmanis. </p>
<p>
  [97] On the record in this case, however, I am not persuaded that Ryan's proportionate 
  culpability exceeds that of his father. Although, as found by the trial judge, 
  Ryan "knew better", his father's conduct created the requisite conditions 
  for a tragic accident. He failed to rectify those conditions prior to or at 
  any point during his stay at the rehabilitation centre. In my view, therefore, 
  James' degree of fault exceeds that of his son. I would apportion their liability 
  on the basis of 45% for James and 30% for Ryan.</p>
<p>
  (4) John: Ryan's Uncle</p>
<p>
  [98] I do not wish to conclude these reasons without commenting on the trial 
  judge's factual findings concerning John, Ryan's uncle, several of which are 
  tainted with overriding and palpable error. </p>
<p>
  [99] John did not testify at trial, although he defended the action and was 
  present in court throughout the trial proceedings. Accordingly, the trial judge 
  did not have the benefit of direct evidence from John concerning his knowledge 
  of Ryan's activities and whereabouts during the days preceding the shooting 
  accident, or concerning the appellants' assertions of negligence against John. 
  </p>
<p>
  [100] Against this backdrop, the trial judge held that there was no evidence 
  that John was aware that Ryan had gone to his father's house in contravention 
  of James' and John's directions that he not do so. This finding is contrary 
  to the evidence, which suggests that John knew that Ryan had been at his father's 
  home at least once, and perhaps twice, while his father was away.</p>
<p>
  [101] Catherine testified in this connection that her husband told her that 
  Ryan was not to be at his father's house during James' absence and that John 
  had discussed this requirement with Ryan. She also testified that, through the 
  operation of the call display feature on her telephone, she discovered on the 
  second day of Ryan's stay with her that Ryan was at his father's house and that 
  he had lied to her concerning his intended activities that evening. When asked 
  on discovery why she did not thereafter confront Ryan with the fact that he 
  was not to be at his father's house, she testified: "It wasn't my business. 
  My husband, I stated to him what my concerns were. As far as I'm concerned it 
  was not my business [emphasis added]." As urged by the appellants, this 
  evidence supports the inference that Catherine told her husband of her concern 
  that Ryan had been at his father's home contrary to the explicit directions 
  that he received from his father and from John. The trial judge did not refer 
  to Catherine's evidence on this issue.</p>
<p>
  [102] As well, Ryan testified that he got "caught" at his father's 
  house by his uncle, that his uncle told the upstairs tenants not to let Ryan 
  into the house, and that there was "fighting" between his uncle and 
  the tenants about Ryan being at the house. The trial judge did not refer to 
  this evidence.</p>
<p>
  [103] The trial judge also held in connection with John that, "the doors 
  were locked and he had the key" [emphasis added]. This finding, which implies 
  that John was in a position to control Ryan's access to his father's house, 
  is also not supported by the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [104] John knew that the upstairs tenants at James' house had a key to the premises 
  and that they used the key to allow Ryan to enter the home on at least one occasion. 
  John spoke to the tenants to prevent a recurrence. Contrary to the trial judge's 
  finding that John "had the key", the evidence demonstrated that John 
  had access to the tenants' key rather than possession of the only or any key 
  to the house. Moreover, the call display incident established that the absence 
  of a key did not deter Ryan from entering the house. As I have said, Ryan obtained 
  a key from James' house on the day of the call display incident, when he broke 
  into the house by entering through a window.</p>
<p>
  [105] Finally, the trial judge's factual findings concerning John are flawed 
  in a third respect. He held that John knew of the presence of a shotgun at James' 
  home. As my colleague Abella J.A. points out in her reasons, this finding is 
  contrary to the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [106] I have carefully considered whether these factual errors by the trial 
  judge led him to err by holding that John was not negligent. I conclude that 
  the trial judge did not err in this regard. </p>
<p>
  [107] There was no demonstration at trial that John knew that there were guns 
  or ammunition in James' house at the time that James entered the rehabilitation 
  centre or in the recent past. There was no evidence that he knew that Ryan was 
  interested in guns or that he had previously played with guns; nor was it clearly 
  established at trial that John knew of Ryan's school truancy. As well, neither 
  of Ryan's parents told John or Catherine about any past behavioural difficulties 
  concerning Ryan. It is also unclear on the record before us that John, in contrast 
  to Ryan, had actually been inside James' house at any time related to James' 
  departure or during James' absence. In addition, John echoed James' direction 
  to Ryan to stay away from his father's house by repeating that instruction to 
  Ryan and by speaking to the tenants in an effort to ensure that they did not 
  again let Ryan into the house after they had first done so. Finally, I do not 
  regard the trial judge's failure to draw an adverse inference against John, 
  due to his failure to testify, as a reversible error. Rather, it was a discretionary 
  decision within the purview of the trier of fact.</p>
<p>
  [108] In the circumstances, it is my view that the evidentiary record in this 
  case does not support a finding of negligence against John. Consequently, the 
  issue of his degree of fault does not arise.</p>
<p>
  (5) Disposition</p>
<p> [109] On consent, all the cross-appeals were withdrawn or abandoned prior 
  to the hearing in this proceeding. For the reasons given, I would allow the 
  appeal, set aside the trial judge's apportionment of liability and substitute 
  the following apportionment in its stead: </p>

<p>In my view, this is not an appropriate case for an award of costs on the appeal.</p>
