<p>On appeal from the order dated June 13, 2003 of Justice Harvey Spiegel, of 
  the Superior Court of Justice, setting aside the conviction of the respondent 
  and ordering a new trial.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [1] The respondent was charged with "blowing over .08". At trial, 
  she argued that the arresting officer could not properly rely on the "fail" 
  registered by the approved screening device in formulating his decision to arrest 
  her and make a breathalyzer demand. The respondent argued that the officer could 
  not rely on the test result as he could not exclude the possibility that the 
  respondent had consumed alcohol within 15 minutes prior to taking the test. 
  The officer acknowledged that consumption of alcohol shortly before the administration 
  of the test could leave residual mouth alcohol which could cause the approved 
  screening device to register a false "fail". The respondent further 
  contended that absent the result from the screening device, the officer did 
  not have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest her or to make the breathalyzer 
  demand. She submitted that the breathalyzer results should be excluded from 
  evidence necessitating her acquittal. The trial judge rejected this argument 
  and convicted the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [2] Spiegel J., allowed the respondent's appeal. He held that as the officer 
  did not know whether the respondent had consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes 
  prior to the making of the demand, the officer should have waited 15 minutes 
  before administering the breath test to avoid the possibility of a false "fail" 
  caused by residual mouth alcohol. Spiegel J. held that the officer could not 
  rely on the result of the test in determining whether he had reasonable and 
  probable grounds to arrest the respondent and make a breathalyzer demand. He 
  further held that as it was possible that the officer had reasonable and probable 
  grounds apart from the "fail" registered by the screening device, 
  there should be a new trial.</p>
<p>
  [3] I would allow the appeal and restore the conviction. Section 254(2) of the 
  Criminal Code requires that the test authorized by that section be administered 
  "forthwith". An officer making a demand may briefly delay the administration 
  of the test if, in his or her opinion, there is credible evidence which causes 
  the officer to doubt the accuracy of a test result unless the administration 
  of the test is briefly delayed. The officer in this case did not doubt the accuracy 
  of the test he performed. On the information available to him, he could form 
  no opinion as to when the respondent had last consumed alcohol. In my view, 
  that assessment was a reasonable one and based on that assessment the officer 
  was entitled to administer the test without delay. </p>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  [4] At about 12:30 a.m. on September 30, 2000, Constable Christopher Williams 
  was assisting other officers who were operating two R.I.D.E. spot checks. He 
  saw the respondent drive her vehicle out of the parking lot of a bar and go 
  northbound towards one of the spot checks. Just before she reached the spot 
  check, the respondent performed a U-turn. Officer Williams followed her car 
  and pulled it over. </p>
<p>
  [5] The respondent said to the officer, "I'm sorry they were giving me 
  directions". Officer Williams detected an odour of alcohol on the respondent's 
  breath, noticed that her eyes were red and glassy and that her speech was slightly 
  slurred. He asked her whether she had consumed any alcohol that night. She replied, 
  "no". The respondent then produced her licence and Constable Williams 
  asked her a second time whether she had consumed any alcohol. The respondent 
  replied: "No, I just came to pick up my boyfriend". </p>
<p>
  [6] Officer Williams suspected that the respondent had alcohol in her body. 
  His suspicion was based on the U-turn made just before reaching the spot check, 
  the odour of alcohol on the respondent's breath, her red and glassy eyes, and 
  her slightly slurred speech. Constable Williams made a demand pursuant to s. 
  254(2) of the Criminal Code requiring the respondent to provide a sample of 
  her breath into an approved screening device. The respondent complied and registered 
  a "fail". Based on the "fail" and his observations, Constable 
  Williams placed the respondent under arrest on a charge of "over .08" 
  and made a demand pursuant to s. 254(3) that the respondent provide a sample 
  of her breath for analysis by a breathalyzer. Officer Williams took the respondent 
  to the police station where she eventually provided two breath samples, the 
  first registered .132 and the second registered .130.</p>
<p>
  [7] In cross-examination, P.C. Williams acknowledged that he asked the respondent 
  twice whether she had been drinking, in part to determine whether she had anything 
  to drink in the 15 minutes before he stopped her. Constable Williams was aware 
  from his training that if a person had consumed alcohol in the 15 minutes prior 
  to the administration of the test, residual mouth alcohol could render the result 
  shown by the screening device unreliable. </p>
<p>
  [8] In cross-examination, Constable Williams was asked why he had administered 
  the test immediately when he knew that the respondent had just exited the parking 
  lot of a bar and was exhibiting several indicia of having consumed alcohol. 
  As the questions and answers set out below demonstrate, counsel took the position 
  that P.C. Williams was obligated to eliminate the possibility that the respondent 
  had consumed alcohol within 15 minutes prior to being stopped before proceeding 
  immediately with the test: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Your, your answer as to how you eliminated mouth alcohol 
  is that basically she denied drinking?</p>
<p class="indent">A. She denied drinking, and she said that she just came to pickup 
  her boyfriend.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Right. But how?</p>
<p class="indent">A. How am I supposed to know that? I don't know.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. How can you ignore her answers and proceed to test her, when 
  you know, reasonably, and I suggest to you you are right, that she is lying 
  to you with respect to whether or not she has had anything to drink?</p>
<p class="indent">A. If she is lying to me, she is lying to me. I have no idea 
  to know if she is lying to me.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. You smell the alcohol from her mouth?</p>
<p class="indent">A. That is correct. </p>
<p class="indent">Q. So there is only two possibilities, either she is lying to 
  you, or there is mouth alcohol, correct?</p>
<p class="indent">A. It doesn't mean that she has had something to drink in the 
  last 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. No, but it doesn't mean that she hasn't either.</p>
<p class="indent">A. That is what I said, I don't know.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And what I am suggesting to you is that you have only two 
  ways of eliminating for mouth alcohol, you either wait, correct, which you didn't 
  do?</p>
<p class="indent">A. That is correct.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Or you have answers which you believe?</p>
<p class="indent">A. That is correct.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. On reasonable grounds. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [9] The respondent did not testify. </p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  [10] Section 254(2) of the Criminal Code authorizes the taking of breath samples 
  for analysis by an approved screening device. It reads in part:: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where a peace officer reasonably suspects that a person who is operating a motor 
  vehicle &#133; has alcohol in the person's body, the peace officer may by demand 
  to that person, require the person to provide forthwith such a sample of breath 
  as in the opinion of the peace officer is necessary to enable a proper analysis 
  of the breath to be made by means of an approved screening device &#133;</p>
<p>
  [11] Section 254(2) is stage one of the two-stage investigatory process set 
  out in s. 254 intended to facilitate the detection, arrest and conviction of 
  those committing drinking and driving offences. Section 254(2) allows a police 
  officer, on mere suspicion that a driver has alcohol in his body, to demand 
  that the driver provide a sample of breath into an approved screening device. 
  If the driver refuses to provide that sample, he or she may be charged with 
  an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code. If the driver provides the 
  sample and registers a "fail" on the screening device, there are no 
  immediate criminal consequences. It is not a crime to fail the screening device, 
  nor can the results be used to prove that a driver was impaired or that his 
  or her blood/alcohol level was over the legal limit. However, if the driver 
  registers a "fail" on the screening device, that result either alone 
  or in combination with other observations made by the officer may provide the 
  officer with reasonable and probable grounds to conclude that the driver had 
  committed a drinking and driving offence. If the officer comes to that conclusion, 
  he or she may arrest the driver and make a breathalyzer demand under s. 254(3). 
  Refusal to comply with that demand absent reasonable excuse is a criminal offence 
  under s. 254(5). If the driver complies with the breathalyzer demand, the results 
  may be admissible against the driver on a charge of impaired driving or driving 
  while having a blood/alcohol level over the legal limit.</p>
<p>
  [12] Section 254(2) provides a ready, quick and reliable means by which an officer 
  can determine whether there are reasonable and probable grounds to arrest a 
  driver for a drinking and driving offence and make a breathalyzer demand. The 
  ready availability of the roadside screening device also has a valuable deterrent 
  effect. Clearly, the roadside screening device serves these salutary purposes 
  only if it yields accurate information.</p>
<p>
  [13] Although a driver who is subject to a demand under s. 254(2) is detained 
  by the police, that section has been held to be a justifiable limit on the driver's 
  right to retain and instruct counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter: R. v. Thomsen, 
  [1988] 1 S.C.R. 640. Section 254(2) is justified under s. 1 of the Charter as 
  a necessary response to the pervasive problem of drinking and driving. In holding 
  that s. 254(2) is a justified limitation on individual constitutional rights, 
  the courts have stressed the requirement in the section that the sample be taken 
  "forthwith" thereby significantly limiting the duration of the individual's 
  detention. An unwarranted delay, even if relatively brief, will take the demand 
  outside of the ambit of s. 254(2) and render the detention unconstitutional: 
  R. v. Grant (1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 268 at 276 (SCC). </p>
<p>
  [14] A police officer who has cause to make a demand under s. 254(2) must administer 
  the test "forthwith" if the detention is to remain within constitutionally 
  permissible limits. At the same time, it is well-known by police officers that 
  where a driver has consumed alcohol in the 15 to 20 minutes before the test 
  is administered, the result of the test may be unreliable because of the presence 
  of residual mouth alcohol. The whole purpose of administering the test under 
  s. 254(2) is to assist the officer in determining whether there are reasonable 
  and probable grounds to arrest the driver for a drinking and driving offence. 
  If the officer does not, or reasonably should not, rely on the accuracy of the 
  test results, it cannot assist in determining whether there are reasonable and 
  probable grounds to arrest. Administering the test without delay in those circumstances 
  would be pointless and would defeat the purpose for which the test is administered.</p>
<p>
  [15] In this case, Constable Williams was aware that if the respondent had been 
  drinking within the 15 minutes preceding the making of the demand, the results 
  of the test could be inaccurate. Officer Williams did not know when the respondent 
  had taken her last drink. He knew it was possible that she had consumed alcohol 
  within the 15 minutes preceding the demand. The question for the courts below 
  and this court is whether Constable Williams was entitled to rely on the results 
  of the screening device test in deciding whether he had reasonable and probable 
  grounds to arrest the respondent when he knew there was a possibility that the 
  respondent had consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes prior to the administration 
  of the test and that if she had, the result of the test could be inaccurate.</p>
<p>
  [16] As I read the reasons of Spiegel J., at para. 25, he interpreted R. v. 
  Bernshaw (1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (SCC), rev (1993) 85 C.C.C. (3d) 404 (B.C.C.A.), 
  as requiring Officer Williams to delay the taking of the breath sample when 
  the circumstances were "sufficient to raise some doubt as to the reliability 
  of the result of the roadside screening device test". Spiegel J. referred 
  to a number of Ontario Superior Court authorities which have held that where 
  a driver may have consumed alcohol in the 15 minutes before the demand is made 
  under s. 254(2), the officer must satisfy himself of the reliability of the 
  roadside testing device before taking the sample (e.g. R. v. Domski, [2002] 
  O.J. No. 3544). These cases hold that where the officer cannot eliminate the 
  possibility of consumption of alcohol within 15 minutes prior to the administration 
  of the test, the officer must wait up to 15 minutes before administering the 
  test. </p>
<p>
  [17] After referring to the information known to the police officer, including 
  the fact that the respondent had driven out of the parking lot of a bar moments 
  before she was stopped, Spiegel J. said at para. 27: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In these circumstances, it is my opinion that the officer could not have a sufficient 
  basis for believing that the results of the approved screening device test were 
  reliable and therefore could not have the requisite subjective belief that grounds 
  existed for the making of the demand under s. 254(3).</p>
<p>
  [18] I read R. v. Bernshaw, supra, differently than did Spiegel J. Before analyzing 
  that authority, however, I think it is important to underscore that if the interpretation 
  of the court below is correct, then some delay in the taking of the s. 254(2) 
  breath test will become routine. Alcohol is very portable. Unfortunately drinking 
  while driving is a well-known phenomenon. Apart from situations where the driver 
  is under close surveillance for 15 to 20 minutes before being stopped or has 
  been in the presence of the police officer for that time before the demand is 
  made, I do not see how a police officer could exclude the possibility that a 
  driver had consumed alcohol in the 15 minutes prior to the making of the demand. 
  A routine delay in the administration of the s. 254(2) test is inconsistent 
  with the rationale that has justified the limitation on constitutional rights 
  inherent in s. 254(2).</p>
<p>
  [19] I turn now to R. v. Bernshaw, supra. In Bernshaw, a police officer saw 
  a car speeding and driving erratically. He pulled the vehicle over and in the 
  course of speaking to the driver observed indicia of alcohol consumption. The 
  driver acknowledged that he had been drinking. The officer made no inquiries 
  as to when the driver had consumed his last drink. Based on his observations, 
  the officer made a demand under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The officer 
  did not know when the driver had last consumed alcohol and proceeded to administer 
  the test without delay. When the breath sample registered a "fail" 
  on the screening device, the officer concluded that he had reasonable grounds 
  to arrest the driver and to make a breathalyzer demand under s. 254(3).</p>
<p>
  [20] The defence called expert evidence at trial to the effect that the consumption 
  of alcohol in the 15 or 20 minutes prior to the taking of a sample by an approved 
  screening device could leave residual mouth alcohol causing the screening device 
  to register a false "fail".</p>
<p>
  [21] The argument that the officer should have briefly delayed the administration 
  of the test failed at trial but succeeded in the British Columbia Court of Appeal. 
  The court unanimously held that since the police officer did not know when the 
  driver had last consumed alcohol, he should have waited 15 to 20 minutes before 
  administering the test. The court observed that both the police manual governing 
  the use of the screening device and the manufacturer's manual recommended waiting 
  15 to 20 minutes before administering the test so as to ensure the accuracy 
  of the readings. In holding that the officer could not rely on the test results 
  to formulate reasonable and probable grounds to arrest or make a breathalyzer 
  demand, McEachern C.J.B.C., at p. 406, described the results as "questionable". 
  Hutcheon J.A. wrote separate reasons indicating at p. 409 that the officer could 
  not rely on results that "may be unreliable".</p>
<p>
  [22] There are several factual similarities between Bernshaw and this case. 
  In both cases, the officers had proper grounds to make a s. 254(2) demand. In 
  both cases, the officers did not know when the driver had taken his or her last 
  drink. In both cases, it was possible that the driver had consumed alcohol in 
  the 15 minutes before the demand was made. In both cases, the officers did not 
  specifically inquire of the driver when he or she had last consumed alcohol, 
  although in this case the question would seem to have been pointless since the 
  respondent had twice denied consuming any alcohol.</p>
<p>
  [23] The reasoning of Spiegel J. closely parallels that of the British Columbia 
  Court of Appeal in Bernshaw. Both hold that the possibility that a driver may 
  have consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes prior to the making of a demand 
  under s. 254(2) is enough to compel the officer to briefly delay the administration 
  of the test. The decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Bernshaw 
  did not, however, withstand appeal. The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously 
  held that the police officer in Bernshaw was not required to delay the administration 
  of the s. 254(2) test. </p>
<p>
  [24] Sopinka J. wrote the majority reasons in Bernshaw. He set out to reconcile 
  the conflict between the statutory language in s. 254(2) which requires that 
  the sample be taken "forthwith" with the unchallenged evidence that 
  in some situations, the result of a test administered without any delay would 
  be unreliable to the knowledge of the officer administering the test. </p>
<p>
  [25] Sopinka J. recognized that the purpose of s. 254(2) was to provide the 
  police with an investigative tool to assist in determining whether there were 
  reasonable and probable grounds to arrest individuals for drinking and driving 
  offences. That purpose would be undermined if officers were required to administer 
  tests in circumstances where they knew the results would be unreliable. Clearly, 
  police officers could not rely on unreliable results in forming their reasonable 
  and probable grounds. Sopinka J. concluded that in such circumstances, some 
  short delay in the taking of the sample was essential if s. 254(2) was to serve 
  its purpose.</p>
<p> [26] Sopinka J., following the example of Arbour J.A. in R. v. Pierman; R. 
  v. Dewald (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 160 (Ont. C.A.)<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>, 
  took a flexible approach to the interpretation of s. 254(2). That approach allowed 
  police officers to briefly delay the administration of the screening device 
  test where that brief delay was necessary to obtain a reliable result. Two passages 
  from his reasons capture his interpretation of s. 254(2): </p>
<p class="indent"> The provision [s. 254(2)] specifically contemplates that the 
  police officer is entitled to demand a breath sample which enables a proper 
  analysis of the breath. In the situation where the officer knows that a suspect 
  has just recently consumed alcohol, a proper sample can only be obtained by 
  waiting at least 15 minutes. Thus, the wording of the provision adds support 
  to the argument that "forthwith" must be given a flexible interpretation. [p. 
  223]</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133; waiting 15 minutes is permitted under s. 254(2) of the 
  Code when this is in accordance with the exigencies of the use of the equipment. 
  This applies where an officer is aware of the potential inaccuracy in the particular 
  case. </p>
<p class="indent">Although there is no doubt that the screening test should generally 
  be administered as quickly as possible, it would entirely defeat the purpose 
  of Parliament to require the police to administer the screening test immediately 
  in circumstances where the results would be rendered totally unreliable and 
  flawed. The flexible approach strikes the proper balance between Parliament's 
  objective in combating the evils of drinking and driving, on the one hand, and 
  the rights of citizens to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. [p. 
  224]</p>
<p>
  [27] The flexible approach to the timing of the taking of the sample espoused 
  by Sopinka J. demands a case-by-case analysis of claims that the demanding officer 
  should have waited or should not have waited before administering the test. 
  It focuses on the officer's belief as to the accuracy of the test results if 
  the test were to be administered without any delay and the reasonableness of 
  that belief.</p>
<p>
  [28] Sopinka J.'s application of the flexible approach to the facts in Bernshaw 
  is found at p. 226: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the present case, there is absolutely no evidence with respect to the timing 
  of the respondent's last drink. That is, it is unknown whether any alcohol was 
  consumed within a period of 15 minutes prior to the screening test. The police 
  officer made no inquiry concerning how long it was prior to administering the 
  screening test that the respondent last consumed alcohol. Without Constable 
  Mashford having this knowledge, it is too speculative to assert that the screening 
  device result was unreliable. Where the particular screening device used has 
  been approved under the statutory scheme, the officer is entitled to rely on 
  its accuracy unless there is credible evidence to the contrary. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [29] The above-quoted passage has direct application to this case. As in Bernshaw, 
  there was no evidence with respect to the timing of the respondent's last drink. 
  Constable Williams had no idea when she had consumed her last drink, and the 
  respondent did not testify or provide that information to Officer Williams. 
  As in Bernshaw, it was "unknown whether any alcohol was consumed within 
  a period of 15 minutes prior to the screening test". The assertion made 
  in this case that the result of the test performed by Constable Williams could 
  be unreliable is no less "speculative" than was the assertion in Bernshaw 
  that the test result could be unreliable. In the circumstances based on the 
  information he had, Constable Williams, like the officer in Bernshaw, was entitled 
  to rely on the accuracy of the statutorily approved screening device and administer 
  the test immediately so as to potentially minimize the detention of the respondent. 
  </p>
<p>
  [30] Counsel for the respondent submits that Bernshaw can be distinguished on 
  its facts. He points out, quite correctly, that the respondent was seen leaving 
  the parking lot of a bar moments before she was stopped by Constable Williams. 
  There was no such evidence in Bernshaw. Counsel submits that the reasons of 
  Arbour J.A. in R. v. Pierman, supra, support the claim that Officer Williams 
  should have waited before administering the test. </p>
<p>
  [31] In Pierman, the officer saw the suspect leave a tavern and the suspect 
  confirmed to the officer that he had consumed two beers. The officer also smelled 
  alcohol on the suspect's breath. The officer testified that he was concerned 
  that the suspect may have consumed alcohol immediately before he was stopped 
  so the officer briefly delayed the administration of the screening device test 
  to avoid an unreliable result. It was argued at trial that the officer should 
  not have waited and that the subsequent demand was not in compliance with s. 
  254(2).</p>
<p>
  [32] Arbour J.A., speaking for this court and applying the flexible approach 
  later adopted by Sopinka J. in Bernshaw, concluded that the officer was entitled 
  to delay the administration of the test. She said at p. 170: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he officer's evidence that he felt that the suspect might have had a beer 
  just before leaving the tavern was sufficient to justify his concern that he 
  might get an inaccurate reading if he were to proceed without delay.</p>
<p>
  [33] Pierman does not dictate that in every case where there is evidence that 
  a driver may have been in a bar shortly before being stopped, the officer must 
  delay the taking of the s. 254(2) sample. The reasons in Pierman, like Bernshaw, 
  focus on the officer's state of mind and the reasonableness of his belief. If 
  an officer honestly believes that some delay is necessary to obtain an accurate 
  sample and if that belief is reasonable in the circumstances, a test administered 
  after an appropriately brief delay remains within the scope of s. 254(2). The 
  fact that an officer had observed the driver leaving a bar moments earlier is 
  a circumstance that has relevance to the question of whether it was reasonable 
  for the officer to delay the taking of the test in order to obtain an accurate 
  sample. </p>
<p>
  [34] The flexible approach to s. 254(2) accepts that different officers may 
  assess similar circumstances differently in deciding whether some brief delay 
  in the administration of the s. 254(2) test is necessary. Indeed, the reasonable 
  and probable standard must reflect the particular officer's assessment tested 
  against the litmus of reasonableness. In considering whether to rely on test 
  results absent some brief delay, one officer may give more significance to the 
  fact that the driver was seen leaving a bar just before he or she was stopped 
  (particularly where the driver admits drinking in that bar) than another officer 
  might give to that fact. The first officer might delay the taking of the test 
  for an appropriately short time while a second officer may proceed without delay. 
  Neither officer has necessarily acted improperly. If the officer decides to 
  delay taking the test and that delay is challenged at trial, the court must 
  decide whether the officer honestly and reasonably believed that an appropriately 
  short delay was necessary to obtain a reliable reading. If the officer decides 
  not to delay the administration of the test and that decision is challenged 
  at trial, the court must decide whether the officer honestly and reasonably 
  believed that he could rely on the test result if the test was administered 
  without any delay.</p>
<p>
  [35] Bernshaw makes it clear that the mere possibility that a driver has consumed 
  alcohol within 15 minutes before taking the test does not preclude an officer 
  from relying on the accuracy of the statutorily approved screening device. Where 
  an officer honestly and reasonably concludes on the basis of available information 
  that he can form no opinion as to whether the driver consumed alcohol within 
  the prior 15 to 20 minutes, the officer is entitled to rely on the accuracy 
  of the statutorily approved screening device and administer the test without 
  delay. That is not to say that another officer might not assess the same situation 
  differently and have legitimate concerns about the reliability of a test administered 
  without a brief delay and act accordingly. In each case, the officer's task 
  is to form an honest belief based on reasonable grounds about whether a short 
  delay is necessary to obtain a reliable reading and to act on that belief. </p>
