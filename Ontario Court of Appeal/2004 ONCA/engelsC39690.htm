<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant raises two grounds of appeal from the decision of the motions 
  judge dated July 23, 2002. First, it argues that the motions judge erred in 
  declaring that the respondent Engels is entitled to solicit the business of 
  his former clients. Second, it submits that the motions judge erred in holding 
  that the appellant's conduct precluded it from seeking equitable relief concerning 
  Engels' former book of business. The second issue does not arise unless the 
  appellant is successful in its assertion that Engels is precluded from soliciting 
  the business of his former clients. After hearing the appellant's submissions 
  on the first issue, we concluded that this ground of appeal could not succeed 
  in the circumstances of this case. Accordingly, we did not call on the respondent 
  and indicated that the appeal was dismissed for reasons to follow. These are 
  those reasons. </p>
<p>A. Background </p>
<p>[2] The respondent Engels is an insurance broker. In October 1994, to resolve 
  various financial difficulties that he was then experiencing, Engels merged 
  his insurance brokerage firm, known as J. M. Dixon Insurance Brokers Inc. (the 
  &quot;Dixon Business&quot;), with the appellant firm, also an insurance brokerage 
  concern. The facts regarding this merger and the subsequent dealings between 
  the parties are detailed in the reasons of the motions judge and need not be 
  repeated here. The following facts are relevant to this appeal. </p>
<p>[3] Engels entered into a brokerage agreement with the appellant on October 
  31, 1994. Under that agreement, the legal and equitable interest in the Dixon 
  Business was transferred to the appellant until October 31, 2001, following 
  which it was to revert to Engels, and Engels agreed to serve as an independent 
  insurance broker with the appellant. In return, the appellant loaned funds to 
  Engels to ease his financial difficulties. It subsequently lent additional funds 
  to Engels for the same purpose. </p>
<p>[4] No express non-solicitation of clients clause, applicable upon Engels' 
  departure from the appellant firm or upon the reversion to Engels of the Dixon 
  Business, was contained in the brokerage agreement. </p>
<p>[5] In March 1997, Engels petitioned himself into bankruptcy. He was discharged 
  from bankruptcy in January 1998. He continued to work as an insurance broker 
  with the appellant firm but relations between the parties deteriorated. Engels 
  had not repaid the appellant the funds previously lent to him. Engels claimed 
  that, as a result, certain of his brokerage commissions were wrongly withheld 
  by the appellant. Litigation between Engels and the appellant ensued. The outstanding 
  commissions were subsequently paid and the appellant's claims were dismissed 
  in mid-June 2000. </p>
<p>[6] The following month, without prior notice to or the knowledge of Engels, 
  the appellant arranged for the bankruptcy to be re-opened, the respondent Richard 
  Killen &amp; Associates Ltd. was appointed as the new trustee in bankruptcy, 
  and at least one further meeting of creditors was held. As well, an offer from 
  the appellant to purchase the Dixon Business was accepted by the new trustee 
  in bankruptcy. </p>
<p>[7] The bill of sale between the trustee and the appellant, dated July 24, 
  2000, provided for the purchase of the Dixon Business on an &quot;as is, where 
  is&quot; basis. It also stipulated that the trustee made &quot;no representation 
  whatever as to quantity or quality&quot;. The bill of sale makes no express 
  reference to non-solicitation by Engels of the clients forming part of the asset 
  sold thereunder or to any right, exclusive or otherwise, of the purchaser to 
  solicit such clients. </p>
<p>[8] When Engels learned of these events, he commenced proceedings to have the 
  appointment of the trustee and the sale to the appellant of Engels' interest 
  in the Dixon Business set aside. Fractious litigation between the parties, including 
  the trustee, followed. In December 2000, the appellant made an offer to settle 
  that litigation, which was accepted by Engels. Subsequently, a consent order 
  dated February 5, 2001 was granted by Farley J. of the Superior Court of Justice 
  by which Engels' interest in the Dixon Business was declared to be vested in 
  the trustee in bankruptcy as of December 20, 1997 and the transfer to the appellant 
  by the trustee of Engels' interest was declared to be &quot;valid and enforceable 
  according to the terms of the Bill of Sale dated July 24, 2000&quot; (the &quot;Consent 
  Order&quot;). The Consent Order makes no reference to solicitation of the clients 
  comprising the Dixon Business. </p>
<p>[9] Engels subsequently sought unsuccessfully to set aside the Consent Order. 
  In addition, an appeal brought by him from the Consent Order was dismissed for 
  delay on consent. Thereafter, in September 2001, Engels brought a motion in 
  which he sought to obtain an order confirming his ability to compete with the 
  appellant for the business of his former clients. That motion was heard by the 
  motions judge in July 2002, resulting in the decision now under appeal. </p>
<p>B. The Client Solicitation Argument</p>
<p>[10] The appellant makes two arguments in support of its submission that the 
  motions judge erred in concluding that Engels was entitled to a declaration 
  that he could solicit his former clients. First, it argues that the real value 
  of the Dixon Business was the right to solicit renewal and new insurance business 
  from the clients comprising that &quot;book of business&quot;. For that reason, 
  standard industry practice contemplates that the sale of a book of business 
  like the Dixon Business would be conditional on a non-solicitation covenant 
  by the former principal of the sold brokerage concern. Accordingly, the appellant 
  argues that, properly understood, the agreement of purchase and sale between 
  the appellant and the trustee in bankruptcy included an implied term that the 
  appellant would be entitled to solicit the pre-bankruptcy clients of the Dixon 
  Business free from any competing solicitation of those clients by Engels. Essentially, 
  the appellant contends that a non-solicitation clause, binding on Engels, should 
  be read into the agreement with the trustee. </p>
<p>[11] Second, and in any event, the appellant argues that the Consent Order 
  is determinative of the issue of whether Engels may solicit clients of the Dixon 
  Business. </p>
<p>[12] In our view, both of these arguments must fail, for several reasons. </p>
<p>[13] First, as we have already mentioned, neither the bill of sale from the 
  trustee or the Consent Order mention solicitation of clients in any way. As 
  a result of its purchase from the trustee of Engels' interest in the Dixon Business, 
  the appellant acquired the right to solicit the renewal and other future business 
  of the clients comprising the Dixon Business. What it now seeks is exclusivity, 
  that is, the right to engage in such solicitation without any competing solicitation 
  by Engels for the business of the same clients. However, that objective or expectation 
  was not expressly recorded in its dealings with the trustee, nor was it incorporated 
  as a term of the settlement of the litigation to which Engels ultimately agreed, 
  leading to the Consent Order. </p>
<p>[14] Second, and importantly, as the motions judge discussed in her reasons, 
  there is a considerable body of jurisprudence supporting the proposition that 
  in an involuntary alienation of assets in a bankruptcy, there is no common law 
  implied obligation on the part of the bankrupt not to compete and solicit former 
  clients. While we agree with counsel for the appellant that this proposition 
  may not be absolute, a matter we need not decide in this proceeding, we conclude 
  that it does apply here given the terms of the bill of sale and of the Consent 
  Order relied upon by the appellant, and the history of the dealings between 
  the parties leading up to the appellant's purchase of Engels' interest in the 
  Dixon Business and the Consent Order. </p>
<p>[15] An involuntary alienation of assets occurred in this case when the appellant 
  arranged, without Engels' knowledge or direct participation, to purchase Engels' 
  interest in the Dixon Business from the trustee in bankruptcy. The Consent Order 
  does not alter the fundamental legal character of that transaction as an involuntary 
  alienation of assets, or enlarge its terms. Nor, in our view, does the Consent 
  Order in any way constitute a voluntary agreement by Engels not to solicit his 
  former clients. </p>
<p>[16] For these reasons, we reject the appellant's contention that a non-solicitation 
  clause should be read into either the bill of sale from the trustee or the Consent 
  Order. In our view, the motions judge was correct to conclude that Engels is 
  entitled to a declaration that he can solicit the former clients of the Dixon 
  Business.</p>

<p>C. Disposition</p>
<p>[17] As the appellant's second ground of appeal arises only if it is concluded 
  that Engels is not entitled to solicit his former clients, a conclusion we reject, 
  it is unnecessary to address it. </p>
<p>[18] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. The respondent Engels is entitled 
  to his costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis, which we fix in the 
  amount of $4,000 inclusive of disbursements and Goods and Services Tax. We make 
  no award of costs concerning the respondent trustee in bankruptcy. </p>
