<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in relying on Officer 
  Kirkpatrick's evidence as expert evidence. However, the testimony was clearly 
  not admitted as expert evidence and we do not read the trial judge's reasons 
  for conviction as using it that way. </p>
<p>[2] In our view, the trial judge properly used the evidence as the officer's 
  opinion as to his understanding of the use of the slang terms in a conversation 
  to which he was a party. The Crown did not need to rely on that single piece 
  of evidence to show that this was the exclusive meaning of the term. No single 
  piece of evidence needs to bear the entire burden of proof. The officer's evidence 
  of his understanding of the meaning of the slang term together with other evidence 
  such as the packaging of the substance and what was commonly sold in the neighbourhood 
  was sufficient to prove the charge of holding out in the circumstances of this 
  case. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
<p>Signed: "Rosenberg J.A."<br>
