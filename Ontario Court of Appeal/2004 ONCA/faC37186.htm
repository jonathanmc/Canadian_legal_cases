<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice J.A. Fontana of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice, Youth Court, on June 7, 2000.</p>
<p>CRONK J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] This case arises out of a vicious attack on a college student at a bus station. 
  The assailant smashed a glass bottle on the victim's nose and slashed both sides 
  of his neck with an exacto knife. A bottle was also thrown at the victim as 
  he was attempting to flee his attacker. The victim sustained injuries to his 
  nose, neck and back.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant, a young person, was charged with one count each of assault 
  causing bodily harm, aggravated assault and breach of undertaking, plus two 
  counts of possession of a weapon. Fontana J. entered convictions on all counts, 
  save on the charge of breach of undertaking. The aggravated assault conviction 
  was stayed in accordance with R. v. Kienapple, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. The appellant 
  was sentenced to a total of five months secure custody and seven months open 
  custody, followed by eighteen months probation. He appeals against conviction, 
  having abandoned his appeal against disposition.</p>
<p>
  [3] The only live issue at trial was identification. The appellant did not testify 
  and no other evidence was called on his behalf.</p>
<p>
  [4] Shortly after the attack, the victim described his assailant to the police 
  in a written statement. Several hours later, he again described the assailant 
  during a police interview and also identified the appellant as his assailant 
  in an in-person police lineup. A friend of the victim, who witnessed the incident, 
  provided a description of the assailant to the police on the day of the attack. 
  As well, both the victim and his friend identified the appellant as the assailant 
  at trial. A third witness provided a description of the assailant during his 
  trial testimony, although he did not provide an in-dock identification of the 
  appellant.</p>
<p>
  [5] The issues on this appeal concern the sufficiency and reliability of the 
  identification evidence and the reasonableness of the verdicts. For the reasons 
  that follow, I would allow the appeal, quash the convictions and direct acquittals 
  on the charges against the appellant.</p>
<p>
  II. FACTS</p>
<p>
  [6] The essential facts are not in dispute and may be summarized as follows.</p>
<p>
  (1) Events Leading up to the Attack</p>
<p>
  [7] A.D. was scheduled to move from Ottawa on April 13, 1998 to begin studies 
  in computer science at Humber College in Toronto. He decided to spend the night 
  before his departure with two other students, J.K. and J.M. </p>
<p>
  [8] The trio began the evening of April 12, 1998 at a local pub in Ottawa where 
  they remained for about two and one-half hours. They then went for a walk and, 
  thereafter, to a near-by restaurant for dinner. While at the restaurant, A.D. 
  and J.K. noticed a group of six or eight Somalian teenagers in the restaurant. 
  The group included both males and females. The group was behaving in a loud 
  and raucous or rowdy fashion. A.D. and J.K. both observed that one of the males 
  in the group had a white towel on his head. No words were exchanged between 
  the two groups. </p>
<p>
  [9] A.D. and his friends left the restaurant at about midnight. They went to 
  a bus stop at a local shopping centre to catch a bus home. They waited about 
  forty or forty-five minutes for their bus. While they were waiting, the same 
  group of Somalians who had been at the restaurant arrived. A.D. and J.K. noticed 
  that one of the men in the group still had a white towel on his head. Again, 
  no words were exchanged between the two groups.</p>
<p>
  [10] A.D. and his friends boarded a bus bound for "Baseline" station. 
  The group of Somalians also boarded the bus and took seats at the rear of the 
  vehicle. Initially, A.D. and his friends were positioned towards the middle 
  of the crowded bus. However, when a seat became available towards the rear of 
  the bus, A.D. took the vacant seat. The Somalians, including the man who was 
  wearing the white towel, were seated across the aisle from him. A.D. testified 
  that at that point, the Somalians became louder and "very obnoxious" 
  in their behaviour. When A.D. looked towards the group, the man with the white 
  towel on his head asked A.D. what he was "staring at". When A.D. replied, 
  "Nothing much. What are you staring at ?", unpleasantries were exchanged 
  between the two men. The man with the towel swore at A.D., but nothing further 
  untoward occurred on the bus.</p>
<p>
  [11] The three students exited the bus at Baseline station. They initially intended 
  to walk to J.K.'s house, which was located a short distance away, but after 
  a few minutes, they decided to return to Baseline station to see if they could 
  catch another bus.</p>
<p>
  (2) The Attack</p>
<p>
  [12] On their return to the station, the students checked a televised bus schedule 
  and learned that they had missed their last bus. It was then about 1:30 a.m..</p>
<p>
  [13] As A.D. was checking the bus schedule, he saw the man with the white towel 
  approaching him. The man had a glass bottle in his hand. </p>
<p>
  [14] At the same time, J.M. observed several teenagers from the Somalian group 
  enter the station. The majority of the male Somalians, including the man with 
  the white towel on his head, were carrying glass bottles. Several of the men 
  stood around J.M., while others stood beside J.K. The man with the towel stood 
  close to A.D. At about that point, J.K., who was standing at the opposite end 
  of the bus station from his friends, left the station and watched the events 
  from outside. </p>
<p>
  [15] Events then unfolded rapidly. According to A.D., within seconds of his 
  first sighting of the man with the towel, the man came up to him, "[r]ight 
  up to my face&#133;within inches. Like, we're talking two inches", and 
  said to A.D.: "What are you going to do now?"</p>
<p>
  [16] A.D. told the man who was wearing the towel to put his bottle down, but 
  the man did not do so. Instead, he swore at A.D. in a threatening manner. Several 
  Somalian females who were present began screaming at A.D. and a second Somalian 
  man, whom A.D. recognized as also having been on the bus earlier, also began 
  yelling at him. The second man then threw a "fake" punch at A.D. that 
  momentarily distracted him from the man who was wearing the white towel.</p>
<p>
  [17] As A.D. turned towards the man who threw the fake punch, the man with the 
  white towel smashed his bottle across A.D.'s nose. A.D. covered his nose, which 
  was gushing blood, with his hands. As he did so, he felt a scratch across the 
  left side of his neck. J.M., who was still standing behind A.D., then yelled 
  a warning, saying: "[A.D.], there's a knife. Get the hell out of here." 
  A.D. then noticed that the man who was wearing the white towel was also holding 
  an exacto knife. The man was still angry and continued to confront A.D., advancing 
  towards him. </p>
<p>
  [18] A.D. turned to leave the bus station. The man with the white towel then 
  attacked A.D. from behind and A.D. felt a knife cross the right front side of 
  his neck. A.D. then turned in J.M.'s direction and saw that the man with the 
  white towel was still holding the knife. A.D. ran. As he was fleeing, he felt 
  an object, which he believed to be a bottle, hit him in the back and heard it 
  fall to the ground behind him. He did not see the person who threw the object. 
  </p>
<p>
  [19] J.M. testified that he saw the man who was wearing the towel strike A.D. 
  with a bottle. Subsequently, as he followed A.D. out of the station, J.M. saw 
  another Somalian male throw a bottle towards him and A.D. As the Somalian youths 
  fled, J.M. ran to assist A.D., and used his cell phone to call the police.</p>
<p>
  [20] J.K. was outside the station during these events. He saw the man who was 
  wearing the white towel attack A.D. from behind as A.D. was trying to leave 
  the station. He testified that he did not see the person who struck A.D.'s face 
  with the bottle, although he stated that it was not the man who was wearing 
  the white towel. After A.D. and J.M. left the station, J.K. approached them 
  and helped J.M. to assist A.D. in using his shirt to staunch the bleeding from 
  his neck. They then flagged down a transportation security officer who was conducting 
  a patrol near Baseline station. Police and emergency personnel arrived shortly 
  thereafter and A.D. was taken to the hospital for treatment. </p>
<p>
  [21] A.D. sustained cuts to both sides of his neck, a broken nose, and a large 
  bruise to the middle of his back. He bled profusely from his neck and nose injuries 
  and required fifteen stitches. J.M. and J.K. were unharmed.</p>
<p>
  [22] The appellant and another individual were arrested by the police at about 
  2:00 a.m. at a location close to Baseline station. Four or five other black 
  youths were apprehended nearby, including two females. No exacto knife or white 
  towel was found in the possession of any of these persons. As well, no bloodstains 
  were visible on the appellant's clothes, although he was wearing several layered 
  white shirts at the time of his arrest. </p>
<p>
  [23] The appellant's clothes were not examined forensically for bloodstains. 
  In addition, no fingerprint or other physical evidence was obtained linking 
  the appellant or any of the other apprehended Somalians to the attack on A.D.</p>
<p>
  (3) Identification Evidence </p>
<p>
  [24] A.D. was taken by the police from the hospital to the police station to 
  permit photographs of his injuries to be taken. While at the police station, 
  A.D. provided a written statement to the police in which he described his assailant 
  as Somalian, with a towel around his head, and about six feet tall.</p>
<p>
  [25] Shortly after the attack at Baseline station, J.M. and J.K. were also taken 
  to the police station to view about sixty photographs of young, dark-skinned 
  males. Neither youth was able to identify A.D.'s assailant from the photographs.</p>
<p>
  [26] Later that same day, sometime between about 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon, 
  A.D. was contacted by the police at his workplace and taken to the police station. 
  Enroute to the station, one of the police officers told A.D. that the police 
  had some suspects in custody who the police believed may have been involved 
  in the incident.</p>
<p> [27] While at the police station, A.D. was interviewed by Detective Ian MacFarlane. 
  In his contemporaneous notes of the interview, MacFarlane attributed the following 
  description of the assailant to A.D.: </p>
<ul>
  <li>guy with white towel</li>
  <li>6 feet tall</li>
  <li>thinner than "me", 160 to 165 pounds</li>
  <li>no facial hair</li>
  <li>long hair, outside towel</li>
  <li>dreads</li></ul>
  
<p class="indent">[emphasis added].</p>

<p>
  [28] Approximately thirty minutes later, A.D. was requested to view an in-person 
  police lineup. At trial, A.D. testified that he understood that he was "going 
  to do a line up, do - - choose the one out of a lineup". He also said that 
  he was told by a police officer that he was going to do a lineup and that another 
  officer was "going to bring in a couple of suspects". The police officer 
  then said, "You tell me if you recognize any".</p>
<p>
  [29] The lineup consisted of the appellant and three other young black males 
  arrested earlier that day by the police in the vicinity of Baseline station. 
  A.D. identified the appellant as his assailant and another man as the person 
  who threw the fake punch at him. A.D. testified at trial that as soon as he 
  saw the men in the lineup, he "knew who the two individuals were that confronted 
  me". He said that he then told the police "exactly which one and each 
  of them did". </p>
<p>
  [30] A.D. also provided an in-dock identification of the appellant as his assailant. 
  When asked by Crown counsel whether he was able "to identify whether or 
  not the person who you say had the bottle and attacked you with the knife is 
  in the courtroom today", A.D. replied "Oh yeah. Absolutely." 
  He then identified the appellant. Later in his testimony, when questioned by 
  Crown counsel concerning his level of confidence in his identification of the 
  two individuals in the police lineup and of the appellant at trial, A.D. replied, 
  "I'd bet my life on it."</p>
<p>
  [31] At trial, J.M. described the assailant as having dark skin, curly hair 
  and a white towel. He also provided an in-dock identification of the appellant 
  as A.D.'s attacker. In a statement that he provided to the police on the day 
  of the attack, J.M. had described A.D.'s assailant in general terms. He said 
  that the assailant was a Somalian male of between eighteen to twenty years of 
  age who had a towel over his head and a "Snapple" bottle in his hand. 
  He made no mention in his statement of the assailant having curly hair; nor 
  did he provide any description of the assailant's facial features.</p>
<p>
  [32] J.K. testified at trial that while he, A.D. and J.M. were on the bus enroute 
  to Baseline station, he was able to get a good look at the man who was wearing 
  the towel on his head. J.K. described him as being tall and having "long 
  - - longer hair than the - - like, peeking out of the back - - back of the towel. 
  That's all I could make - - make out". He provided no other description 
  of the assailant and was not asked at trial whether he could identify the appellant 
  as the assailant.</p>
<p>
  III. Issues </p>
<p>
  [33] This appeal concerns the sufficiency and reliability of the Crown's identification 
  evidence and the reasonableness of the verdicts against the appellant. </p>
<p>
  IV. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) Standard of Appellate Review</p>
<p>
  [34] The appellant argues, in essence, that the verdicts in this case are unreasonable 
  and that they cannot be supported by the evidence within the meaning of the 
  developed jurisprudence under s. 686(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code. </p>
<p>
  [35] The function of an appellate court on such an appeal is well-established. 
  The appellate court is to determine whether, on the facts that were before the 
  trier of fact, a jury properly instructed and acting reasonably could convict 
  the accused. To make this determination, the appellate court is required to 
  review the evidence and re-examine and, to some extent, re-weigh it. If, upon 
  that assessment, the appellate court concludes that the conviction of the accused 
  cannot reasonably be supported by the evidence, the trial court's verdict may 
  be overturned under s. 686(1)(a)(i): see R. v. Biniaris, [2000] S.C.R. 381; 
  R. v. Burke, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 474; R. v. S. (P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909; and 
  R. v. Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168.</p>
<p>
  (2) Positions of the Parties</p>
<p>
  [36] The Crown asserts that in the absence of error, the determination of the 
  sufficiency and reliability of identification evidence is a question for the 
  trier of fact: see R. v. H.M.S., [2001] B.C.J. No. 2287 (C.A.); R. v. Campbell, 
  [1998] O.J. No. 2332 (C.A.); and R. v. Keshane, [1992] B.C.J. No. 450 (C.A.). 
  It submits that the youth court judge committed no error and that the verdicts 
  are reasonable. Accordingly, appellate intervention is not warranted.</p>
<p>
  [37] The appellant contends that the youth court judge erred in concluding that 
  the identification evidence was sufficient to support a finding of guilt on 
  the criminal standard. In particular, he submits that the youth court judge 
  erred: (i) in downplaying defects in the identification process and in over-emphasizing 
  the opportunity of the witnesses to observe A.D.'s assailant; and (ii) in assessing 
  the reliability of the identification evidence on the basis of A.D.'s honesty 
  and his conviction in the accuracy of his identification of the appellant as 
  his assailant.</p>
<p>
  (3) Discussion</p>
<p>
  [38] The identification evidence at trial consisted of: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) descriptions of the assailant provided by A.D. in his written 
  statement to the police and during his subsequent interview with MacFarlane;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) A.D.'s identification of the appellant as his assailant 
  in an in-person police lineup;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) J.M.'s description of the assailant provided to the police 
  on the day of the attack;</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) in-dock identifications of the appellant as the assailant 
  by A.D. and J.M.; and</p>
<p class="indent">(v) J.K.'s description of the assailant at trial.</p>
<p>
  [39] The inherent frailties of eyewitness identification evidence are well-established 
  and have frequently been commented upon by appellate courts. These frailties 
  can lead to wrongful convictions, even in cases where multiple witnesses have 
  identified the same accused. For that reason, it is essential that identification 
  evidence be subject to appropriate scrutiny, especially where, as here, no confirmatory 
  evidence exists that is capable of minimizing the inherent dangers of the eyewitness 
  identification of the accused: R. v. Miaponoose (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 445 
  at 450-51 (Ont. C.A.). See also R. v. Burke, supra, at paras. 52-53.</p>
<p>
  [40] The assailant was a stranger to A.D. and his friends. The appellant's convictions 
  rest entirely on the identification evidence. There is no other direct or circumstantial 
  evidence capable of minimizing the dangers inherent in the eyewitnesses' identification 
  of the appellant. Thus, rigorous scrutiny of the Crown's identification evidence 
  was required by the youth court judge.</p>
<p>
  (i) Defects in the Identification Evidence </p>
<p> (a) Police Lineup and In-Dock Identification of Appellant</p>
<p>
  [41] The process by which pre-trial identification evidence is obtained is of 
  particular significance if the value of the evidence is to be maintained. In 
  R. v. Smierciak (1946), 87 C.C.C. 175, this court emphasized that the means 
  employed to obtain evidence of identification must not involve any acts which 
  might reasonably prejudice the accused. In that connection, the court said at 
  p. 177, "Anything which tends to convey to a witness that a person is suspected 
  by the authorities, or is charged with an offence, is obviously prejudicial 
  and wrongful".</p>
<p>
  [42] This statement was elaborated upon by Charron J.A. in Miaponoose at pp. 
  453 and 456: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [I]t is crucial that procedures which tend to minimize the inherent dangers 
  of eyewitness identification evidence be followed as much as possible in any 
  given case. Irreversible prejudice to an accused may flow from the use of inappropriate 
  police procedure and, unless adequately counter-balanced during the course of 
  the judicial process, may result in a serious miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent"> In all cases, the suspect should be presented to the complainant 
  in circumstances that minimize any suggestion that the police believe the suspect 
  is the offender.</p>
<p>
  [43] Crown counsel on this appeal concedes that the procedures followed in the 
  police lineup were not "ideal". In my view, they were far from it. 
  The procedures were inappropriate and clearly prejudicial to the appellant. 
  </p>
<p>
  [44] Although the appellant was not presented to A.D. as the single police suspect, 
  he was shown a lineup comprised only of four persons, all of whom were police 
  suspects. In addition, A.D. was told that the police had suspects in custody 
  who the police believed may have been involved in the attack. Subsequently, 
  and immediately before A.D. viewed the police lineup, he was told that a police 
  officer was "going to bring in a couple of suspects". He was not told 
  that the person who attacked him might not be in the lineup. These procedural 
  deficiencies had the effect of creating the expectation that the persons whom 
  A.D. was about to see were considered by the police to be suspects and that 
  the lineup included the assailant. In the circumstances, these deficiencies 
  in the lineup procedures significantly undermined the weight to be attached 
  to A.D.'s lineup identification of the appellant as his assailant. </p>
<p>
  [45] The youth court judge recognized that the police lineup procedures were 
  flawed. He stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There is merit to the defence argument that the lineup was faulty. A lineup 
  held with only four persons, and all four of those persons being suspects in 
  the incident, cannot be viewed in any other way. The process is not redeemed 
  by the police referring to it as an impromptu or an informal lineup. But categorizing 
  it as faulty does not mean it is entirely useless, or of no probative value. 
  The only question is, what weight, if any, may be made of the ritual? What purpose, 
  however modest, might it serve from an evidentiary point of view?</p>
<p>
  [46] The youth court judge thus correctly noted that the use of inappropriate 
  pre-trial identification procedures affects the weight of the subsequent identification. 
  The issue is whether the initial identification of the appellant in the lineup 
  was so tainted as to be worthy of no weight, or whether other evidence served 
  to validate A.D.'s identification of the appellant: see Miaponoose at pp. 458-59. 
  </p>
<p>
  [47] The in-dock identification of the appellant provided by each of A.D. and 
  J.M. adds little. As this court confirmed in R. v. Izzard (1990), 54 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 252 at 255-56, in-dock identification is unsatisfactory and attracts little 
  weight. A.D.'s in-dock identification of the appellant followed his earlier 
  pre-trial identification of the appellant in the flawed police lineup. It was 
  nothing more than a bald, although forceful, assertion that the appellant was 
  the assailant. It is subject to, and tainted by, the weaknesses of the earlier 
  identification: Izzard, at pp. 255-56; Smierciak at p. 178; and Miaponoose at 
  pp. 458-59. J.M.'s in-dock identification of the appellant suffered from no 
  positive pre-trial identification of the appellant by J.M. It was analogous 
  to a police "show up" in which the only person shown to the identifying 
  witness is the very person suspected by the police to be guilty of the offence 
  charged. This type of identification has little probative value: R. v. Nguyen, 
  [2000] O.J. No. 2129 at para. 41 (C.A.); R. v. Reitsma (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 
  1 at paras. 56-59 (S.C.C.); R. v. Williams (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 234 at 235 
  (Ont. C.A.). It is not contested that when J.M. identified the appellant at 
  trial, the appellant was the only black teenaged male in the courtroom. </p>
<p>
  [48] The youth court judge ultimately concluded that the similarities between 
  A.D.'s and J.M.'s descriptions of the assailant and the appellant's characteristics, 
  and the opportunity of A.D. and his friends to observe the assailant, were sufficient 
  to support the convictions of the appellant. Based on this additional evidence, 
  he was of the view that "the so-called informal lineup demonstrated that 
  the key witnesses [sic] recognized and confirmed the assailant as being the 
  accused". For the reasons that follow, I disagree. </p>
<p>
  (b) Opportunities to Observe and</p>
<p>
  Descriptions of the Assailant</p>
<p>
  [49] There are several critical discrepancies between the descriptions of the 
  assailant provided by the eyewitnesses and the physical characteristics of the 
  appellant at the time of his arrest.</p>
<p>
  [50] A.D. initially provided a limited and general description of his attacker 
  to the police. He said that his assailant was Somalian, had a towel around his 
  head, and was about six feet tall. Subsequently, when interviewed by MacFarlane, 
  A.D. added that the assailant weighed 160 to 165 pounds and had "no facial 
  hair", "long hair, outside towel" and "dreads". </p>
<p>
  [51] At the time of his arrest, the appellant had short, curly black hair, a 
  moustache, and a goatee. </p>
<p>
  [52] At trial, A.D. confirmed that he was familiar with the hairstyle known 
  as "dreadlocks". He said that the term "dreadlocks" referred 
  to long, unwashed hair in strands and acknowledged that there is a difference 
  between "dreadlocks" and curly hair. He agreed that the word "dreads" 
  in MacFarlane's notes of his interview with him referred to "dreadlocks" 
  and that it was possible that he had described his assailant to MacFarlane as 
  having "dreads". A.D. also testified, based on a photograph of the 
  appellant at the time of his arrest, that he would not have described the appellant 
  as having "dreadlocks" or "dreads". He offered no explanation 
  for the discrepancy between his recorded use of the term "dreads" 
  in respect of the assailant and the absence of dreadlocks on the appellant; 
  nor did he claim that he misspoke during his interview with MacFarlane. </p>
<p>
  [53] When cross-examined on his "no facial hair" comment, the following 
  exchange occurred between A.D. and defence counsel: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. &#133;on the night you were attacked, you would easily see 
  that moustache and that goatee, wouldn't you, two inches from his face?</p>
<p class="indent">A. If I was paying attention. I could've seen it, yes.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Except?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Except what?</p>
<p class="indent">Q. The person you saw had no facial hair. Correct?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Well, let's talk about it. You said you didn't know terms 
  before, you didn't know hairstyles.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, if I call that facial hair, that's a disgrace.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. You said if I was paying attention. What did you mean by 
  that?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Well, you said earlier on if - - you said you didn't know 
  hairstyles. You said there was mushroom cuts.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. O.K. Well, the way we term each other is, if I grew a goatee 
  and I barely had any hair on my face, that's not hair - - that's not facial 
  hair. It's just like puberty hair.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. You knew that the detective was trying to get the best possible 
  description from you of the person&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> A. I agree.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. &#133;that attacked you.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Right.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. You were two inches from his face.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Um-hmm.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. In which case, if this had been the man, you would have 
  seen the facial hair above his lip and below his nose. Correct?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. O.K. Correct.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And you would've seen the facial hair on his chin as shown 
  clearly in photo number 2. Correct?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Correct. </p>
<p>
  [54] The youth court judge accepted A.D.'s explanation for the discrepancy between 
  his description of the assailant as having "no facial hair" and the 
  appellant's actual facial hair and addressed this misdescription in A.D.'s identification 
  evidence in the following fashion: </p>
<p class="indent"> There was considerable cross-examination about what he - - 
  that is to say, [A.D.] -- meant by "dreads". He conceded, when shown the accused's 
  photo, that the accused did not have dreads as we know them. The accused in 
  the photograph has what might be described as curly hair.</p>
<p class="indent">The photo also discloses what might be described as a thin goatee 
  and mustache [sic]. When cross-examined on his apparent failure to note this, 
  [A.D.] explained that he took "facial hair" to mean something more pronounced 
  and obvious, and alluded to defence counsel Mr. Carroll's own full beard. [A.D.] 
  described the hair in the photo as being "puberty hair". I do not think he was 
  -- and by this, I intend no pun whatsoever -- I do not think he was splitting 
  verbal hairs in drawing this distinction.</p>
<p>
  &#133;.</p>
<p>
  I am of the view that the misuse of the word "dreads" by [A.D.] to 
  Detective MacFarlane is not determinative of the issue. This was not a situation 
  of either a fleeting or limited observation opportunity. In fact, it was quite 
  the opposite. The prolonged opportunity and observations by the key witnesses 
  of the accused, who had, in fact, focused attention upon himself with his unusual 
  headgear and conduct, took the matter from the realm of identification into 
  the recognition phase.</p>
<p>
  [55] In addition, on the basis of "the prolonged opportunity and observations 
  by the key witnesses of the accused [emphasis added]", including A.D.'s 
  opportunities for observation of his assailant, the youth court judge concluded 
  that A.D. had "misuse[d]" the word "dreads" when speaking 
  with MacFarlane and that this misuse was insignificant. In my view, with respect, 
  the youth court judge erred in his assessment of the differences between the 
  descriptions of the assailant and the characteristics of the appellant, and 
  in his consideration of the significance of these discrepancies, in several 
  respects.</p>
<p>
  [56] First, there was no evidentiary support for the youth court judge's conclusion 
  that A.D. had "misused" the term "dreads". A.D.'s testimony 
  established that he was familiar with the term, understood its meaning, and 
  regarded it as signifying a distinct hairstyle different from the hairstyle 
  that he subsequently learned was worn by the appellant. A.D.'s description of 
  the assailant as having "dreads" did not implicate the appellant. 
  It served to exonerate him as the assailant.</p>
<p>
  [57] Second, notwithstanding that A.D. and his assailant were face-to-face and 
  only two inches apart during their encounter at Baseline station, A.D. offered 
  three descriptors of the assailant that were at odds with the appellant's physical 
  appearance at the time of his arrest. In addition to describing the perpetrator 
  as having "no facial hair" and "dreads", A.D. also said 
  that he had "long hair, outside towel". In his reasons, the youth 
  court judge made no reference to this third descriptor, that is, to the length 
  and placement of the assailant's hair in relation to the towel, and its significance 
  in comparison to the appellant's appearance.</p>
<p>
  [58] This omission is important because J.M. was the only eyewitness who testified 
  that the assailant, like the appellant, had curly hair. In contrast, J.K. testified 
  that he "got a good look" at the man with the white towel while he 
  was on the bus and that the man had "long - - longer hair than the - - 
  like, peeking out of the back - - back of the towel". The youth court judge 
  made no reference to J.K.'s description of the man with the towel. This description 
  was consistent with A.D.'s statement to MacFarlane that the assailant had "long 
  hair, outside towel". It was also inconsistent with the nature and appearance 
  of the appellant's hair at the time of his arrest.</p>
<p>
  [59] Third, and importantly, none of the Crown's eyewitnesses suggested that 
  the assailant had any facial hair. A.D., as I have said, expressly indicated 
  to the contrary. In this respect, as well, the description of the assailant 
  provided by the eyewitnesses did not describe the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [60] The youth court judge correctly observed that A.D. and his two friends 
  had four discrete opportunities to observe the man who was wearing the white 
  towel: (i) at the restaurant; (ii) at the bus stop while they were waiting for 
  their bus; (iii) on the bus; and (iv) at Baseline station where the attack occurred. 
  With the exception of the events at Baseline station, these opportunities to 
  observe the assailant were not stressful or brief.</p>
<p>
  [61] The youth court judge also noted that, by his conduct and choice of headgear, 
  the man with the white towel on his head attracted attention to himself throughout 
  the evening's events. However, there was no evidence at trial that any of the 
  eyewitnesses focused on the facial appearance of the man with the white towel 
  during any of the four occasions when they were positioned to observe him, although 
  they noticed that he was wearing a white towel. </p>
<p>
  [62] In addition, there was evidence at trial that J.K.'s and J.M.'s opportunities 
  to observe the assailant at the critical time - during the attack at Baseline 
  station - were constrained. J.K. did not see who struck A.D. with the bottle, 
  although he testified that it was not the man who was wearing the white towel, 
  and he was outside the station for most of the assaultive incident. J.M. testified 
  that although he saw the man who was wearing the white towel strike A.D. with 
  a bottle, from his viewpoint much of the assailant's face was obscured by the 
  towel. Thus, he said that he only saw the assailant in profile. Later, when 
  J.M. observed the assailant attack A.D. from behind, J.M. said that he had only 
  a brief view of the front of the assailant's face. Finally, when the assailant 
  jumped on A.D.'s back, still attempting to fight, the assailant's back was to 
  J.M.</p>
<p>
  [63] Given the flaws in the pre-trial identification procedures applicable to 
  the original identification of the appellant by A.D., and the minimal evidential 
  worth of the in-dock identifications of the appellant as the assailant, it was 
  especially important in this case that the physical descriptions of the assailant 
  provided by the eyewitnesses be fully and carefully scrutinized. As observed 
  by Charron J.A. in Miaponoose at p. 459, "[T]he precision and accuracy 
  with which [an eyewitness describes the] assailant becomes of particular important 
  in the circumstances where very little weight can be attached to [the witness'] 
  initial identification of the [accused as the] assailant."</p>
<p>
  [64] In this case, no witness provided a description of the assailant's facial 
  features, before or at trial, that matched those of the appellant in anything 
  more than a generic sense. To the contrary, several of the assailant's features 
  as described by the eye-witnesses were dissimilar to the established features 
  of the appellant. Those features that were similar between the two youths - 
  skin colouring, age and height - established only a resemblance between them. 
  They did not identify the appellant as the assailant: see R. v. Chartier (1980), 
  48 C.C.C. (2d) 34 at 52 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  (ii) Honesty and Certainty of the Eyewitnesses</p>
<p>
  [65] The appellant submits that the youth court judge erred in assessing the 
  reliability of the identification evidence by relying on A.D.'s honesty and 
  conviction in the certainty of his identification of the appellant as his assailant. 
  I would not give effect to this submission.</p>
<p>
  [66] In assessing the reliability of the identification evidence, the youth 
  court judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  With regard to the three main Crown witnesses, some specific comment is required 
  with regard to the issue of credibility of these individuals -- that is to say 
  [A.D., J.M. and J.K.]. I use the term 'credibility' here in the sense of opportunity 
  to observe, powers of observation, and ability to communicate and articulate 
  the events in court.</p>
<p>
  The truthfulness factor is hardly an issue here. The three witnesses have demonstrated 
  forthrightness and accuracy in their testimony. In no case was there any attempt 
  to colour testimony to their favour, despite many opportunities to do so. In 
  each case where they were tentative or unsure with regard to a particular fact, 
  that, too, was forthcoming.</p>
<p>
  In the case of the complainant, [A.D.], there was no indic-ation of vengefulness 
  or concoction. [J.M.], being an obser-ver rather off to one side, had a somewhat 
  more objective view of the events. [J.K.'s]&#133;observations are&#133;somewhat 
  limited to the events before&#133;his leaving the bus terminal -- and again, 
  afterwards, he had certain observations when he changed his mind and returned.</p>
<p>
  [67] Later in his reasons, the youth court judge commented: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The witnesses -- particularly the victim, [A.D.], and the witness, [J.M.] -- 
  have identified the person wearing the white-towel headgear as "the assailant" 
  and "the accused". The identification is made with considerable conviction 
  by these individuals.</p>
<p>
  [68] The quoted comments of the youth court judge do not indicate that he placed 
  undue reliance on A.D.'s credibility and conviction in the accuracy of his identification 
  of the appellant. Rather, his comments simply reflect his assessment of the 
  creditworthiness of A.D., J.M. and J.K., measured against some of the traditional 
  indicators of truthfulness. In addition, when commenting directly on the credibility 
  of these witnesses, the youth court judge explained that he was referring to 
  their "sense of opportunity to observe, powers of observation, and ability 
  to communicate and articulate the events in court". These are legitimate 
  and well-established factors to be considered in the assessment of a witness' 
  credibility.</p>
<p>
  [69] It is true that the youth court judge referred to A.D.'s and J.M.'s identification 
  of the appellant as having been made "with considerable conviction". 
  Read as a whole, however, the reasons of the youth court judge make it abundantly 
  clear that his accep-tance of the sufficiency and reliability of the identification 
  evidence was driven by the multiple opportunities that these witnesses had to 
  observe the assailant and their asserted observations of him. The youth court 
  judge stated in this connection: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The most significant feature of the Crown evidence, in my view, in this case 
  is the unusually generous opportunity which the witnesses had to observe the 
  assailant. </p>
<p class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> I am satisfied that as a result of these prolonged, isolated 
  episodes, the witnesses had sufficient opportunity to observe and note the individual 
  and to recognize him again if they saw him [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [70] The youth court judge's reasons demonstrate that he distinguished between 
  the assessment of the credibility of the eyewitnesses and the obligation to 
  examine the reliability of their evidence of identity. I am far from persuaded 
  that he erred by relying on the honesty and certainty of the witnesses in their 
  identification of the appellant to raise the Crown's identification case to 
  the requisite criminal standard of proof: see Reitsma at para. 61 and Izzard 
  at p. 255.</p>
<p>
  (4) Conclusion </p>
<p>
  [71] The pre-trial identification procedures employed in this case rendered 
  A.D.'s identification of the appellant in the police lineup suspect and of little 
  evidential weight. A.D.'s subsequent in-dock identification of the appellant 
  as the assailant did not add any weight to his initial identification, and J.M.'s 
  in-dock identification suffered from inherent evidential frailty. The pre-trial 
  and in-dock identifications of the appellant as the assailant were insufficient 
  to support his convictions. In addition, the original des-criptions of the assailant 
  provided by the Crown's witnesses were general in nature. Thereafter, notwithstanding 
  their close proximity to the assailant at the time of the attack and their various 
  opportunities throughout the evening to observe him, none of the Crown's eyewitnesses 
  provided a description of the facial features of the assailant which matched 
  the facial characteristics of the appellant. Moreover, A.D.'s and J.K.'s descriptions 
  of the hair and hairstyle of the man with the white towel differed from the 
  appellant's corresponding features. Finally, the Crown led no other direct or 
  circumstantial evidence connecting the appellant to the attack on A.D., failed 
  to call as witnesses any of the other Somalian youths who were involved in the 
  night's events to place the appellant at the scene, and led no forensic evidence 
  linking the appellant to the attack.</p>
<p>
  [72] For these reasons, I conclude that the identification evidence was insufficient 
  to support the verdicts. A properly instructed jury, acting reasonably, could 
  not have found that the identification evidence in this case met the requisite 
  criminal standard of proof.</p>
<p>
  V. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [73] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, quash the convictions and enter 
  acquittals in their place.</p>
