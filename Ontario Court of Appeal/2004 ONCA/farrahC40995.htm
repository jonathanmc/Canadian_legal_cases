<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice John F. McGarry of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on October 21, 2003.</p>
<p>
  ARMSTRONG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant was convicted of trafficking in crack cocaine and possession 
  of the proceeds of crime after a trial before McGarry J. and a jury on October 
  17, 2003. The Crown alleged that the appellant sold a quantity of crack cocaine 
  to an undercover police officer for $40.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant defended the charges on two grounds: first, that no such transaction 
  ever occurred; and second, that if such a transaction occurred, it did not involve 
  the appellant. </p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant admitted that he was a drug dealer but testified that he would 
  never sell drugs to the undercover police officer, whom he had met on a previous 
  occasion. He testified that his clientele was primarily limited to skinny women 
  dancers - persons who were known to him and were apparently users of crack cocaine.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant raises four grounds of appeal - all related to the judge's 
  charge to the jury: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The trial judge erred in failing to provide a limiting instruction 
  in respect of the appellant's admission that he was a drug dealer;</p>
<p class="indent">2. The trial judge erred in his instructions on reasonable doubt 
  when he failed to advise that a reasonable doubt may be derived from a lack 
  of evidence;</p>
<p class="indent">3. The trial judge erred in instructing the jurors on their 
  duties in a manner which was tantamount to a "timid juror" instruction; and</p>
<p class="indent">4. The trial judge erred in his answer to the jury's question 
  with respect to reasonable doubt by describing the evidence for the Crown in 
  some detail and advising the jury to consider it first and then to consider 
  the evidence for the defence, thereby appearing to shift the onus.</p>
<p>
  [5] No objection was taken at trial by counsel for the appellant concerning 
  any of the above grounds. However, as this court has often said, a failure to 
  object by counsel is not necessarily fatal to success on appeal.</p>
<p>
  [6] I am of the view that the trial judge did err in failing to provide a limiting 
  instruction with respect to the appellant's admission that he was a drug dealer. 
  </p>
<p>
  [7] The trial judge gave a limiting instruction regarding the appellant's criminal 
  record, which included convictions for some eleven criminal offences, including 
  two convictions for possession of a narcotic and one conviction for possession 
  of a Schedule 1 substance for the purpose of trafficking. However, he did not 
  provide any instruction on how the jury should deal with the appellant's admission 
  that he was a drug dealer.</p>
<p>
  [8] There was a real risk that the jury could infer guilt based solely on the 
  appellant's admission that he engaged in the selling of illicit drugs. It was 
  therefore incumbent on the trial judge to instruct the jury that even though 
  the appellant had admitted his occupation as a drug dealer in his own defence, 
  the jury should not infer guilt on the specific charges solely because of that 
  admission. In my view, the failure to provide such an instruction constitutes 
  reversible error.</p>
<p>
  [9] The trial judge's charge to the jury was in error in failing to tell the 
  jury that a reasonable doubt may be derived from a lack of evidence. However, 
  this was not a case where a lack of evidence was an issue. The major issue in 
  this case was identification. The Crown's identification evidence was based 
  on a police officer's testimony that he identified the appellant based on his 
  prior knowledge of, and past dealings with him. The judge's charge on identification 
  contained the usual cautionary instruction. I would not use the absence of a 
  reference to a lack of evidence as a basis for allowing the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [10] Counsel for the appellant submitted that the following instruction is the 
  equivalent of a "timid juror" instruction: </p>
<p class="indent"> Your responsibility is a heavy one and is not to be undertaken 
  lightly, but seriously and courageously, having in mind your duty to the community 
  and your duty to the accused. You must face your responsibilities. You must 
  be honest in your judgment. You must exercise your judgment without fear or 
  without favour.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the functions of the State is to protect the life, property 
  and liberty of all of its citizens. Crime must be suppressed when detected and 
  the offender must be dealt with according to law.</p>
<p>
  Your duty and responsibility in this case is to determine the innocence or guilt 
  of the accused. It is of no concern to you as to the results of your decision 
  in the event that you should find him guilty. The responsibility for what happens 
  as a result of your verdict is mine and for which I accept full responsibility.</p>
<p>
  [11] Although the words "timid juror" do not appear in the charge, 
  counsel submits that the above excerpt represents a strong exhortation by the 
  trial judge on the duty of the jury to convict. I disagree. This instruction 
  does not attract the same critique that was made by the court in R. v. Karthiresu 
  (K.) (2000), 129 O.A.C. 291 at 293. While the language may be somewhat stronger 
  than the language one usually sees, it is balanced with a reference in the next 
  paragraph in which the trial judge advised the jury: "You owe a high duty 
  to the accused to see that he is not improperly convicted."</p>
<p>
  [12] Finally, counsel for the appellant submitted that in answering one of the 
  jury's questions on reasonable doubt he appeared to reverse the onus when describing 
  the Crown's evidence and then advising the jury to consider the defence evidence. 
  When one considers the judge's charge as a whole, I do not agree that he fell 
  into error on this particular aspect of his recharge. He had earlier given the 
  appropriate instruction in accordance with R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742. 
  I do not think that the jury would have been confused.</p>
<p>
  [13] In the result, I would allow the appeal, set aside the convictions and 
  order a new trial.</p>
