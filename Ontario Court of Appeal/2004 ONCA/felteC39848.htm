<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Mr. Felte appeals the decision of Belleghem J. ordering him to pay his 
  former wife an equalization payment of $100,000 and lump sum spousal support 
  of $75,000 or monthly support of $1,500 per month for six years. </p>
<p>
  [2] Although the trial took place over five days, the evidence of the value 
  of Mr. Felte's assets on the date of the marriage, and especially on the date 
  of separation, was not entirely satisfactory. Mr. Felte's brother, whose evidence 
  would have been helpful in understanding his financial dealings with the appellant, 
  did not testify. Mr. Felte's accountant acted largely on the instructions of 
  Mr. Felte and his evidence must be assessed in that light. </p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge ought to have done a proper net family property calculation. 
  Nonetheless, given the evidence he had, he tried to arrive at a just result 
  between two parties whose financial means were once much greater than they apparently 
  are now. In making the order he did, the trial judge was entitled to take into 
  account Mr. Felte's conduct during the marriage and the rapid down paying of 
  his loans at the time of separation (see para. 25 of the reasons). </p>
<p>
  [4] Overall, we are satisfied that the trial judge's findings and conclusions 
  are supported by the evidence before him and that the result is fair. Accordingly, 
  the appeal is dismissed. In the circumstances there shall be no costs. </p>
