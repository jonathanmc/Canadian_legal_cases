<p>On appeal from a committal order of Justice R.D. Reilly of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated August 15, 2002 and an application for judicial review of an 
  order of surrender of the Minister of Justice dated February 26, 2003.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, a Canadian citizen, was indicted in the United States, together 
  with twenty-eight other individuals, on several charges of securities fraud, 
  conspiracy, and money laundering. He was arrested in Ontario on a provisional 
  warrant of arrest issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern 
  District of New York and committed for extradition by Reilly J. At the extradition 
  hearing, the appellant conceded that there was sufficient evidence to commit 
  him for extradition. However, he challenged the constitutionality of ss. 32(1)(a) 
  and 33(1) of the Extradition Act, S.C. 1999, c. 18 ("Act"). The appellant 
  conceded that the extradition judge was bound by this court's decision in United 
  States of America v. Yang (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 52, upholding the constitutionality 
  of those sections, but argues before this court that Yang did not address the 
  situation of a Canadian citizen being sought for extradition.</p>
<p>
  [2] Following his committal, the appellant directed written submissions to the 
  Minister of Justice requesting the Minister to decline to order his surrender 
  on the grounds that it would violate the appellant's rights under ss. 6 and 
  7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Minister dismissed this 
  request and ordered the appellant's surrender. </p>
<p>
  [3] Sections 32 and 33, introduced as part of the new Act that came into force 
  in 1999, eliminate the need for first-hand sworn evidence and permit the requesting 
  state to proceed on the basis of an unsworn record of the case. The foreign 
  prosecutor or judge is required only to provide a summary of the evidence and 
  to certify that the evidence is available for the purposes of prosecution in 
  the requesting state. </p>
<p class="indent"> 32.(1) Subject to subsection (2), evidence that would otherwise 
  be admissible under Canadian law shall be admitted as evidence at an extradition 
  hearing. The following shall also be admitted as evidence, even if it would 
  not otherwise be admissible under Canadian law: </p>
<p class="indent10"> (a) the contents of the documents contained in the record 
  of the case certified under subsection 33(3);</p>
<p class="indent10">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent10">(c) evidence adduced by the person sought for extradition 
  that is relevant to the tests set out in subsection 29(1) if the judge considers 
  it reliable.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Evidence gathered in Canada must satisfy the rules of evidence 
  under Canadian law in order to be admitted.</p>
<p class="indent">33.(1) The record of the case must include</p>
<p class="indent">(a) in the case of a person sought for the purpose of prosecution, 
  a document summarizing the evidence available to the extradition partner for 
  use in the prosecution;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A record of the case may include other relevant documents, 
  including documents respecting the identification of the person sought for extradition.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) A record of the case may not be admitted unless</p>
<p class="indent">(a) in the case of a person sought for the purpose of prosecution, 
  a judicial or prosecuting authority of the extradition partner certifies that 
  the evidence summarized or contained in the record of the case is available 
  for trial and</p>
<p class="indent">(i) is sufficient under the law of the extradition partner to 
  justify prosecution,</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) was gathered according to the law of the extradition partner&#133;. 
  . </p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(4) No authentication of documents is required unless a relevant 
  extradition agreement provides otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) For the purposes of this section, a record of the case includes 
  any supplement added to it.</p>
<p>[4] The appellant appeals the order of committal and seeks judicial review 
  of the Minister's decision to surrender him to the American authorities. The 
  appeal and the application for judicial review raise the following issues: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Does the evidentiary standard for the admissibility of evidence 
  in ss. 32(1)(a) and 33 of the Act violate the appellant's s. 7 Charter rights?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Does the s. 32(1)(c) "reliability" requirement imposed on 
  evidence adduced by the party sought for extradition violate s. 7 of the Charter?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Would the appellant's extradition violate his rights under 
  s. 6(1) of the Charter?</p>
<p>
  [5] This appeal and application for judicial review was heard during the same 
  week and by the same panel that heard the appeal in United States of America 
  v. Latty and Wright and the decisions in both cases are being released at the 
  same time. </p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>
  1. Does the evidentiary standard for the admissibility of evidence in ss. 32(1)(a) 
  and 33 of the Act violate the appellant's s. 7 Charter rights?</p>
<p>
  [6] Yang upheld the constitutionality of ss. 32(1) and 33. The appellant did 
  not request a five-judge panel of this court to review the correctness of Yang. 
  Accordingly, Yang governs.</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant submits that Yang is distinguishable on the grounds that he 
  is a Canadian citizen and is thereby entitled to insist upon a more stringent 
  standard of evidence to justify his extradition. The appellant argues that in 
  the case of a Canadian citizen, procedural fairness requires a higher evidentiary 
  standard of reliability than contemplated by ss. 32 and 33, relying on expert 
  evidence to the effect that civil law countries do not, as a general rule, permit 
  the extradition of their nationals. </p>
<p>
  [8] We do not agree with this submission. It would be contrary to both the established 
  pattern of Canadian extradition law and to the language of s. 7 of the Charter, 
  which guarantees fundamental justice to "everyone", not just to Canadian 
  citizens, to say that s. 7 requires one extradition regime for non-Canadians 
  and another for Canadian citizens. See Federal Republic of Germany v. Schreiber, 
  [2002] O.J. No. 3170 (Sup. Ct.) at para. 38 per Watt J.: "By its terms, 
  s. 7 applies to everyone. The comprehensive term 'everyone' embraces equally 
  the citizen and the non-citizen. There is nothing in the terms of s. 7, nor 
  inherent in the rights it protects, that justifies a differential application 
  dependent on citizenship." </p>
<p>
  [9] In our view, the treatment of citizens in civil law jurisdictions does not 
  assist the appellant. Jurisdictions that refuse to extradite citizens typically 
  assert jurisdiction to try their own citizens for offences committed abroad. 
  This stands in stark contrast with common law regimes, including that of Canada, 
  where the assertion of criminal law jurisdiction is, as a general rule, territorial 
  for citizens and non-citizens alike. We shall return to the question of citizenship 
  below when considering the appellant's s. 6(1) argument.</p>
<p>
  2. Does the "reliability" requirement imposed by s. 32(1)(c) on evidence 
  adduced by the party sought for extradition violate s. 7 of the Charter?</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant submits that as evidence led by an individual sought for 
  extradition must be considered "reliable" by the extradition judge, 
  s. 32(1)(c) imposes a higher standard on the individual than it imposes on the 
  requesting state, and should be struck down as violating the principles of fundamental 
  justice guaranteed by s. 7 of the Charter. In our view, this argument must be 
  dismissed. The appellant did not raise this argument either before the extradition 
  judge or before the Minister. Nor did he not attempt to lead evidence on his 
  extradition hearing. The argument is advanced for the first time on appeal with 
  no factual basis. In these circumstances, it is not open to the appellant to 
  advance this submission on this appeal. </p>
<p>
  [11] We would also observe that while the point was not explicitly raised in 
  Yang, Rosenberg J.A. did consider the argument when assessing the constitutionality 
  of ss. 32 and 33 as a whole. Rosenberg J.A. referred to Bourgeon v. Canada (Attorney 
  General) (2000), 187 D.L.R. (4th) 542 (Ont. Sup. Ct.) where it was held that 
  the imposition of the reliability requirement in s. 32(1)(c) was fundamentally 
  unfair. At para. 58, Rosenberg J.A. expressly disagreed with the proposition 
  "that fairness requires that the reliability condition imposed by statute 
  upon evidence sought to be adduced by the fugitive must also be applied to the 
  evidence sought to be adduced by the extradition partner." See also Germany 
  v. Ebke (2001), 203 D.L.R. (4th) 415 (N.W.T. S.C.), affirmed [2003] 9 W.W.R. 
  61 (N.W.T.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused [2003] S.C.C.A. No. 178; 
  United States of America v. Richardson, [2003] O.J. No. 823 (Sup. Ct.). The 
  reliability requirement in s. 32(1)(c) must be read in the context of the section 
  as a whole. Extradition involves foreign proceedings and Parliament has decided 
  that, in the interest of comity, evidence may be led even if it would not otherwise 
  be admissible under Canadian law. In the case of evidence led by the requesting 
  state, pursuant to s. 33(3), the record of the case will not be admitted unless 
  certified by a judicial or prosecuting authority of the requesting state to 
  be sufficient to justify prosecution and as having been gathered according to 
  the law of the requesting state. To require the same certification for evidence 
  led by the person sought for extradition would not be practicable and, indeed, 
  would almost certainly work to the individual's disadvantage. It is replaced, 
  in a functional sense, by the reliability requirement and, in our view, the 
  reliability requirement should be interpreted accordingly. This does not, in 
  our view, produce a situation where the evidence led by the individual will 
  be subjected to a higher admissibility threshold than the evidence led by the 
  requesting state. </p>
<p>
  3. Would the appellant's extradition violate his rights under s. 6(1) of the 
  Charter?</p>
<p>
  [12] It is common ground that the extradition of a Canadian citizen constitutes 
  a prima facie violation of s. 6(1) of the Charter that must be justified as 
  a reasonable limit under s. 1: see United States of America v. Cotroni, [1989] 
  1 S.C.R. 1469. The appellant argues that the relaxed evidentiary standard of 
  reliability introduced by ss. 32 and 33 of the Act is, when applied to a Canadian 
  citizen, fundamentally unfair and therefore cannot be justified as a reasonable 
  limit on the appellant's s. 6(1) right. The Minister rejected this submission 
  on the following ground: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The evidentiary rules under the Act do not alter the fact that extradition is 
  a justified limitation upon section 6 Charter rights. It is my view that admissibility 
  of evidence at an extradition hearing is a procedural fairness and fundamental 
  justice issue and not a citizenship rights issue. Accordingly, the real issue 
  is whether committing an individual for extradition based upon evidence provided 
  in a Record of the Case accords with the principles of fundamental justice. 
  As indicated above, these provisions have been judicially determined to comport 
  with the principles of fundamental justice. Consequently, I see no basis to 
  refuse surrender based on this submission.</p>
<p>
  [13] We see no reason to interfere with the Minister's decision. As we have 
  already noted, Yang holds that the evidentiary regime established by ss. 32 
  and 33 accords with the principles of fundamental justice. In our view, that 
  determination presents an insurmountable hurdle to the argument that those same 
  provisions fail to qualify as a reasonable limit on the appellant's s. 6(1) 
  rights. </p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [14] Accordingly, the appeal and the application for judicial review are dismissed.</p>
