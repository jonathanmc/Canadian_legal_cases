<p>On appeal from a judgment of Justice Heidi Polowin of the Superior Court of 
  Justice, dated February 14, 2002, made at Ottawa, Ontario.</p>
<p>FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION </p>
<p>
  [1] This case requires the court to interpret the meaning of a relatively new 
  exemption in the Execution Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E. 24, s. 2.6, which will be 
  important for debtors both within and outside the bankruptcy process. The case 
  also raised an issue that has recently been considered by both the Nova Scotia 
  and Alberta courts of appeal in VW Credit Canada, Inc. v. Roberts (2001), 192 
  N.S.R. (2d) 79 (C.A.), and Norkus Estate (Trustee of) v. Direct Rental Centre 
  (West) Ltd. (2001), 299 A.R. 39 (C.A.). The issue involves the interplay among 
  the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, the Personal Property 
  Security Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 10, and the Execution Act, and whether an unperfected 
  secured creditor of a bankrupt can take the benefit of exempt property in priority 
  to the debtor and the trustee in bankruptcy. However, because the result of 
  the first issue finally disposes of the appeal, I will not decide the second 
  issue in this appeal.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [2] The facts can be simply stated. The debtor, James Allen Fields, filed an 
  assignment in bankruptcy on June 12, 2001. At that date, DaimlerChrysler Financial 
  Services (debis) Canada Inc. (the creditor) held a conditional sale contract 
  with Mr. Fields on a 1998 Chrysler Intrepid, but had not perfected its security 
  interest in the vehicle under the PPSA. The creditor filed a proof of claim 
  in the bankruptcy for the balance of $22,257.41 owing on the car. The agreed 
  value of the car at the time was $11,000. The trustee in bankruptcy disallowed 
  the creditor's claim as a secured claim because it was unperfected, but allowed 
  it as an unsecured claim. The creditor appealed, claiming that it was entitled 
  to its security interest and priority over the trustee to the extent of $5,000, 
  because the debtor has an exemption from execution and from the bankruptcy estate 
  for vehicles up to the value of $5,000 under the Execution Act. The debtor originally 
  claimed no exemption in respect of the car, and later disclaimed his exemption 
  in the car. The Registrar dismissed the creditor's appeal as did the bankruptcy 
  judge on appeal.</p>
<p>
  THE STATUTORY BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [3] Section 67(1)(b) of the BIA excludes from property of a bankrupt divisible 
  among the creditors on a bankruptcy "any property that as against the bankrupt 
  is exempt from execution or seizure" under the relevant provincial law. 
  In Ontario, that is the Execution Act.</p>
<p>
  [4] In April 2001, a new subsection 2.6 was added to the section of the Execution 
  Act that describes chattels that are exempt from seizure to include "[a] 
  motor vehicle not exceeding &#133; $5,000 in value."</p>
<p>
  [5] Section 7 of the Execution Act provides that the exemptions "do not 
  apply to exempt any chattel from seizure to satisfy a debt contracted for the 
  purchase of such chattel" with some exceptions for certain necessities 
  of life.</p>
<p>
  [6] Finally, s. 20 of the PPSA provides that "until perfected, a security 
  interest&#133;(b) in collateral is not effective against&#133;a trustee in bankruptcy".</p>
<p>
  [7] In the context of this statutory matrix, the creditor argues that in a bankruptcy 
  the unsecured creditors are not entitled to the distribution of any property 
  of the bankrupt that is exempt from execution. Under s. 2.6 of the Execution 
  Act, up to $5,000 of the value of the debtor's car is exempt, and that exemption 
  is automatic or may be claimed by a secured creditor on behalf of the debtor 
  in the bankruptcy. As a secured creditor with an unperfected purchase money 
  security interest (PMSI) in the car, although the security is not valid against 
  the trustee, it remains valid against the debtor, so that the unperfected secured 
  creditor becomes entitled to the portion of the value of the car that is exempt 
  from execution in priority to the debtor and the trustee in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>
  THE FINDINGS OF THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE</p>
<p>
  [8] The bankruptcy judge held: (1) the vehicle in this case was not exempt because 
  its value exceeded $5,000; (2) even if there was an exemption for up to $5,000 
  of the value of the vehicle, that exemption would not apply in this case because 
  of the PMSI held by the creditor in the vehicle; and (3) if the vehicle had 
  been exempt in respect of up to $5,000 of its value, the debtor was entitled 
  to waive that exemption and the creditor cannot claim the $5,000 exemption for 
  the vehicle on the debtor's behalf.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [9] There are three issues raised in this appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Under s. 2.6 of the Execution Act, does the exemption from 
  seizure apply only when the total value of a car is $5,000 or less, or does 
  it apply to exempt the first $5,000 of the value of the debtor's equity in the 
  car?</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Does s. 7 of the Execution Act operate on bankruptcy to 
  negative the exemption from seizure where the car was purchased with a PMSI 
  but the secured creditor failed to perfect its secured interest?</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Can the creditor claim the exemption in a bankruptcy on 
  behalf of the debtor if the debtor wishes to waive it?</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  Interpretation of s. 2.6 of the Execution Act</p>
<p>
  [10] The trustee in bankruptcy argued successfully before the bankruptcy judge 
  that the wording of s. 2.6 of the Execution Act is clear and unambiguous. On 
  the plain meaning, it provides an exemption from execution for a motor vehicle 
  not exceeding $5,000 in value. Therefore, any vehicle valued at $5,000 or less 
  is exempt and any vehicle over $5,000 is not exempt. In this case the value 
  of the motor vehicle in issue is $11,000. Consequently, the exemption does not 
  apply.</p>
<p>
  [11] The alternative argument is that the section, properly interpreted, means 
  that where the vehicle is valued at more than $5,000, the exemption applies 
  to the first $5,000 of the vehicle's value. In that situation, the vehicle would 
  be sold and the first $5,000 would be remitted to the debtor with the balance 
  over $5,000 going to the execution creditor. Whereas, following the trustee's 
  interpretation, where the debtor has a vehicle valued at over $5,000, the execution 
  creditor receives the entire car and the debtor receives nothing.</p>
<p>
  [12] From a policy point of view, the alternative argument that gives the most 
  benefit to the judgment debtor is compelling. The purpose of the exemptions 
  from execution is to allow a debtor to retain the basics of life while making 
  the bulk of his or her assets available to satisfy judgment creditors. The legislature 
  sets and revises from time to time both the type and the value of exempt assets 
  with a view to allowing contemporary debtors to retain a modest and dignified 
  lifestyle, while still making funds and assets available to pay legitimate judgment 
  creditors. </p>
<p>
  [13] While some people of modest means may own an old car that has depreciated 
  in value down to $5,000 or less, in today's society many people who are able 
  to do so, rather choose to finance an inexpensive model vehicle by making monthly 
  payments to a secured lender. The alternate approach recognizes this reality 
  by allowing the secured creditor to repossess the car, sell it and return up 
  to $5,000 of the debtor's equity to the debtor on an exempt basis. The trustee's 
  interpretation would require the secured lender, who repossesses a car worth 
  over $5,000, to remit any amount over and above what was owed to the lender 
  not back to the debtor, but to the sheriff to satisfy a writ of execution, thereby 
  denying the debtor any benefit from his or her equity in the car.</p>
<p>
  [14] The amendment that added the new exemption in s. 2.6 to the Execution Act 
  in 2000 was part of an omnibus bill, the Red Tape Reduction Act, S.O. 2000, 
  c. 26, Sch. A, s. 8, that contained amendments to many acts. The new exemption 
  reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  2. The following chattels are exempt from seizure under any writ issued out 
  of any court: </p>
<p class="indent"> 6. A motor vehicle not exceeding the prescribed amount or, 
  if no amount is prescribed, $5000 in value.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
</p>
<p> [15] Before the addition of this subsection, motor vehicles up to $2,000 in 
  value could be exempt under a different subsection (s. 2.3) if they were ordinarily 
  used by the debtor in his or her business: See R.S.O. 1990, c. E. 24.<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> 
  The new subsection now allows any debtor the ability to retain a motor vehicle, 
  whether or not the vehicle is used in the debtor's business. The 2000 amendments, 
  which came into force in 2001, also increased the exempt value for items used 
  in business to $10,000. </p>
<p>
  [16] There is, however, a significant difference in the operation of the exemptions 
  provided for chattels used by a debtor in business and in farming from the other 
  exemptions, including the new motor vehicle exemption. This can best be explained 
  by first setting out in full ss. 2, 3 and 4 of the Execution Act: </p>
<p class="indent">
  2. The following chattels are exempt from seizure under any writ issued out 
  of any court: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Necessary and ordinary wearing apparel of the debtor and 
  his or her family not exceeding the prescribed amount or, if no amount is prescribed, 
  $5,000 in value.</p>
<p class="indent">2. The household furniture, utensils, equipment, food and fuel 
  that are contained in and form part of the permanent home of the debtor not 
  exceeding the prescribed amount or, if no amount is prescribed, $10,000 in value.</p>
<p class="indent">3. In the case of a debtor other than a person engaged solely 
  in the tillage of the soil or farming, tools and instruments and other chattels 
  ordinarily used by the debtor in the debtor's business, profession or calling 
  not exceeding the prescribed amount or, if no amount is prescribed, $10,000 
  in value.</p>
<p class="indent"> 4. In the case of a person engaged solely in the tillage of 
  the soil or farming, the livestock, fowl, bees, books, tools and implements 
  and other chattels ordinarily used by the debtor in the debtor's business or 
  calling not exceeding the prescribed amount or, if no amount is prescribed, 
  $25,000 in value.</p>
<p class="indent"> 5. In the case of a person engaged solely in the tillage of 
  the soil or farming, sufficient seed to seed all the person's land under cultivation, 
  not exceeding 100 acres, as selected by the debtor, and fourteen bushels of 
  potatoes, and, where seizure is made between the 1st day of October and the 
  30th day of April, such food and bedding as are necessary to feed and bed the 
  livestock and fowl that are exempt under this section until the 30th day of 
  April next following.</p>
<p class="indent"> 6. A motor vehicle not exceeding the prescribed amount or, 
  if no amount is prescribed, $5,000 in value.</p>
<p class="indent"> 3.(1) Where exemption is claimed for a chattel referred to 
  in paragraph 3 of section 2 that has a sale value in excess of the amount referred 
  to in subsection (1.1) [the prescribed amount or $10,000] plus the costs of 
  the sale and other chattels are not available for seizure and sale, the chattel 
  is subject to seizure and sale under a writ of execution and the amount referred 
  to in subsection (1.1) shall be paid to the debtor out of the proceeds of the 
  sale.</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) The debtor may, in lieu of the chattels referred to in 
  paragraph 4 of section 2, elect to receive the proceeds of the sale thereof 
  up to the amount referred to in subsection (4.1) [the prescribed amount or $25,000], 
  in which case the officer executing the writ shall pay the net proceeds of the 
  sale if they do not exceed the amount referred to in subsection (4.1) or, if 
  they exceed the amount referred to in subsection (4.1), shall pay that sum to 
  the debtor in satisfaction of the debtor's right to exemption under that paragraph.</p>
<p class="indent"> 4. The sum to which a debtor is entitled under subsection 3(1) 
  or (2) is exempt from attachment or seizure at the instance of a creditor.</p>
<p> [17] The effect of ss. 3(1) and (2) in the case of business or farming chattels 
  where the value exceeds the prescribed exempt value is that they can be sold 
  and the sum representing the exempt value can be given to the debtor. Then s. 
  4 protects from seizure the sum that is paid to the debtor. Otherwise, under 
  s. 19(1), those funds would be subject to immediate seizure for the benefit 
  of the judgment creditors.<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> </p>
<p>
  [18] Unfortunately, when the new s. 2.6 was added in 2000, ss. 3 and 4 were 
  not amended to make them applicable to motor vehicles that became exempt under 
  that subsection. The appellant submits that those sections should be applied 
  by analogy in order to maintain the intent and purpose of the Act.</p>
<p>
  [19] Curiously, this court faced a very similar situation in 1965 in the case 
  of Robinson v. Robinson, [1965] 1 O.R. 326 (C.A.), following certain amendments 
  that were made to the Execution Act in the 1942 and 1957 revisions and carried 
  forward into the 1960 revised statutes (R.S.O. 1960, c. 126). Prior to these 
  revisions, the 1937 version of the exemptions (R.S.O. 1937, c. 125), which was 
  virtually unchanged since 1909, included ss. 2(f), 3 and 4, which provided that 
  the sheriff could sell tools used in the debtor's business, without differentiating 
  between farmers and others, where the value of a tool exceeded the exempt amount 
  and where there were not other goods to satisfy the execution. In that case, 
  the exempt amount would be paid to the debtor. In addition, the debtor could 
  elect to receive the proceeds of sale of his or her tools up to the exempt amount, 
  in lieu of keeping the tools. In both cases, the sums received by the debtor 
  in lieu of chattels were also exempt from seizure. The sections read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  2. The following chattels shall be exempt from seizure under any writ issued 
  out of any court, namely: </p>
<p class="indent"> . . .</p>
<p class="indent">(f) Tools and implements of, or chattels ordinarily used in, 
  the debtor's occupation, to the value of $200; but if a specific article claimed 
  as exempt be of a value greater than $200 and there are not other goods sufficient 
  to satisfy the writ such article may be sold by the sheriff who shall pay $200 
  to the debtor out of the net proceeds, but no sale of such article shall take 
  place unless the amount bid therefor shall exceed $200 and the cost of sale 
  in addition thereto; </p>
<p class="indent"> 3. The debtor may, in lieu of tools and implements or of chattels 
  ordinarily used in his occupation referred to in clause (f) of section 2, elect 
  to receive the proceeds of the sale thereof up to $200, in which case the officer 
  executing the writ shall pay the net proceeds of the sale if the same do not 
  exceed $200, or, if the same exceed $200, shall pay that sum to the debtor in 
  satisfaction of the debtor's right to exemption under clause (f).</p>
<p class="indent"> 4. The sum to which a debtor is entitled, under clause (f) 
  of section 2, or under section 3, shall be exempt from attachment or seizure 
  at the instance of a creditor.</p>
<p>
  [20] In the 1942 revision, the provision for sale if a tool exceeded the exempt 
  value was removed, but the option of the debtor to receive the exempt value 
  in money was retained along with the exemption for that money in the hands of 
  the debtor. In the 1957 revision, the exemption for tools was separated into 
  two subsections of s. 2: s. 2.5 for non-farmers and s. 2.6 for farmers, with 
  the farmers receiving a higher exempt value for their tools. In the revision, 
  s. 3, which provided the option for the debtor to receive money in lieu of the 
  tools, now referred only to s. 2.6 and not s. 2.5. However, s. 4 still exempted 
  the sums received by a debtor under both ss. 2.5 and 2.6. The result of all 
  these amendments was that although there was no longer any explicit provision 
  for sale of non-farm tools and remittance of the exempt value in money to the 
  debtor, the Act still exempted money received by the debtor in respect of both 
  farm and non-farm tools. </p>
<p>
  [21] The issue of whether non-farm tools that had a value exceeding the exempt 
  value were still subject to sale arose squarely for the court in Robinson. A 
  wife had obtained judgment against her husband for arrears of maintenance owing 
  under a separation agreement. Acting on a writ of execution, the Sheriff seized 
  a car that the husband used in his business as a salesman. At the time, the 
  market value of the car was $1,700. The exempt value for non-farm tools in the 
  1960 version of the Act was up to $1,000. </p>
<p>
  [22] The issue for the Court of Appeal was whether the car, which was valued 
  at over $1,000, was exempt, and if the whole car was not exempt, whether it 
  should be sold with the first $1,000 paid to the debtor and the excess to the 
  creditor. The court concluded, looking at the language of the section, that 
  the legislature had not intended by its amendments to change the law that goods 
  over the exempt value of $1,000 were subject to sale. The section provided that 
  they were exempt "to the extent of $1,000", and by s. 4, the debtor 
  was entitled to receive that $1,000 as exempt proceeds of a sale.</p>
<p>
  [23] Following the Robinson case, the Ontario Law Reform Commission was asked 
  to consider the exemption section of the Act. In its report of December 9, 1966, 
  titled Re: The Execution Act - Exemptions, the Commission noted that there was 
  uncertainty created by the amendments to the exemption section in 1942 and 1957, 
  but that the problem had been resolved by the Court of Appeal in the Robinson 
  case. However, for clarity, the Commission recommended that the pre-1942 statutory 
  language be restored. The recommendations of the Commission were implemented 
  and are reflected in the wording of the current Act, except for the newly-added 
  subsection 2.6.</p>
<p>
  [24] The question before this court now is whether an analysis similar to the 
  one conducted by the court in Robinson, can be used to read s. 2.6 as providing 
  an exemption for the value of a car up to $5,000, and by implication or analogy, 
  for the sale of such a car with payment of the first $5,000 to the debtor. Although 
  this would give the provision a common sense meaning and a purposeful interpretation, 
  the court is obliged to interpret the words of a statute in the context of the 
  language of the entire statute and of the sections of which it forms part. This 
  is the thrust of the now oft-quoted statement from Elmer A. Driedger in The 
  Construction of Statutes (Toronto: Butterworths, 1974) at 67: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are 
  to be read in their entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense 
  harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention 
  of Parliament.</p>
<p>
  [25] In the Robinson case, although the sale provision for non-farm tools had 
  been removed from the statute (s. 2.5), s. 4 specifically exempted monies to 
  which a debtor was entitled under s. 2.5. The court was therefore able to conclude 
  that the intent of the legislature was to continue to allow for the sale of 
  non-farm tools and payment of the exempt proceeds up to the exempt value to 
  the debtor.</p>
<p>
  [26] The problem with interpreting s. 2.6 as suggested by the appellant is that 
  it requires reading a reference to s. 2.6 into s. 4. As noted above, s. 4 is 
  an essential component of the exemption scheme. It makes the monies received 
  by a debtor as proceeds from the sale of an exempt chattel also exempt. Without 
  that exemption, the sheriff could seize those monies immediately from the debtor 
  (s. 19(1)).</p>
<p>
  [27] Although the same issue arose in the Alberta case of Re Pearson (1997), 
  203 A.R. 109 (Q.B.), respecting the interpretation of the comparable exemption 
  provision in the Alberta Civil Enforcement Act (R.S.A. 1980, c. C-10.5) to s. 
  2.6, the wording of that Act is different from the Ontario Execution Act and 
  therefore the analysis of the court in that case does not assist. After prescribing 
  the exempt values in s. 88, s. 89(1) provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  89(1) Where the enforcement debtor's equity in the property referred to in s. 
  88 exceeds the prescribed value of the exemption for that property, that property 
  is subject to sale pursuant to writ proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [28] Based on s. 89, the Alberta court was able to conclude that the exemption 
  applied to the debtor's equity in the motor vehicle even if the value of the 
  vehicle was higher than the prescribed value. </p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [29] Although it would give the section the interpretation that makes the most 
  common sense, would be most helpful to debtors and would fit with the intent 
  and purpose of the philosophy of exemptions, the court cannot read into s. 4 
  a reference that is not there. Nor can it be justified either by implication 
  or by analogy. Although it is likely that the failure of the legislature to 
  amend s. 4 when it added s. 2.6 was an oversight, if it was, it is only the 
  legislature and not the court that can make the correction.</p>
<p>
  [30] Therefore, I conclude that reading the section as worded, because the value 
  of the motor vehicle in this case is over $5,000, it is not exempt under s. 
  2.6.</p>
<p>
  [31] The effect of affirming the conclusion of the bankruptcy judge on the first 
  issue means that there is no exemption in this case. In the result, the appeal 
  must be dismissed. There is, therefore, no need to address the second and third 
  issues which are now hypothetical, as they only arise if the exemption applies.</p>
<p>
  [32] For the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondent 
  fixed in the amount of $9,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
