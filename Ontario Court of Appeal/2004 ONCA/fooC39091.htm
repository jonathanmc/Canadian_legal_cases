<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants appeal the judgment of Justice Maurice Cullity dated October 
  18, 2002 declaring that Foo was not the beneficial owner of 5,413,097 common 
  shares in the capital of BGI Systems Integration Ltd. (&#147;BGI&#148;).</p>
<p>[2] The appellants challenge the trial judge&#146;s decision on two principal 
  bases: (1) he improperly relied on extrinsic parol evidence in order to analyze 
  several transactions involving the shares; and (2) he failed to give sufficient 
  weight to an &#145;entire agreement&#146; provision in the first agreement relating 
  to the shares.</p>
<p>[3] We disagree. There were two agreements at the heart of the relationship 
  between the parties. The May 14, 1996 Share Exchange Agreement transferred the 
  disputed BGI shares to the appellant. However, in the October 1, 1996 Acknowledgement, 
  Foo affirmed that he had no beneficial interest in the shares.</p>
<p>[4] Both parties introduced, without objection, extensive extrinsic evidence 
  to try to explain a series of complicated transactions. The trial judge identified 
  a number of problematic factors &#150; transactions occurring over a three year 
  period, overlapping documents, unclear revocations of some documents, absence 
  of legal advice with respect to some documents and parties, inconsistencies 
  in the documents, significant backdating of documents giving rise to uncertainty 
  about the order of execution, and various trusts being treated as legal persons 
  capable of being parties to contracts and of holding property beneficially. 
  Because of these difficulties, the trial judge said:</p>
<p class="indent">The existence of these factors makes it impossible to adhere 
  strictly to the principle that parties to commercial transactions should be 
  held to the terms they have reduced to writing. Too often the documentation 
  reflects either what the parties hoped to effect in the future &#150; rather 
  than what they intended to put in place when the documents were executed &#150; 
  or an attempt to give a false and misleading impression that certain dispositions 
  had been made, or actions taken in the past.</p>
<p>[5] Based on his analysis of the documents and the testimony of all the principals 
  involved in the transactions, the trial judge concluded that the Share Exchange 
  Agreement was not effective to transfer ownership of BGI shares to Foo in May 
  1996 because the underlying purpose of the transaction was never fulfilled &#150; 
  namely, obtaining public financing for the company.</p>
<p>[6] In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge relied on extrinsic parol 
  evidence, which the appellants challenge. However, their challenge places them 
  on the horns of a dilemma. The trial judge also relied on extrinsic parol evidence 
  to conclude that Foo&#146;s October Acknowledgement that he was not a beneficial 
  owner of the shares was also not effective. In short, the trial judge engaged 
  in an identical analysis with respect to both documents.</p>
<p>[7] In these circumstances where there is essentially one course of dealings 
  between the parties which had several episodes, it follows that if the appellants 
  were successful in their submissions relating to the May document, the logic 
  of the submission would need to flow through to the October transaction. The 
  result would be that, although Foo would have become the owner of the shares 
  in May, he would have given them back in October.</p>
<p>[8] We note also that the trial judge referred to Foo&#146;s &#147;private 
  agenda&#148; in his relationship with the respondents &#150; namely, his desire 
  &#147;to preserve his claim to the BGI shares&#148; after the May transaction, 
  even if public financing was not achieved. The trial judge found that he proceeded 
  knowing that the respondents were unaware of this and had a different approach. 
  He maintained this position, which led to this litigation, even though he did 
  nothing for four years (until 2001 when he learned of the proposed takeover 
  of BGI) to indicate that he regarded himself as an owner of the shares.</p>
<p>[9] The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $15,000.00, inclusive of disbursement 
  and GST.</p>
