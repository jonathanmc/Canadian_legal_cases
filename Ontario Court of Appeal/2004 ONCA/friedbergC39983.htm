<p>On appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court (Blair R.S.J., Carnwath 
  and J. MacDonald JJ.) dated January 13, 2003 with leave of this court granted 
  May 20, 2003.</p>
<p>FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The issue in this case is the proper interpretation and application of s. 
  443(1) of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M. 45, which allows taxpayers to 
  obtain a refund of taxes that were "overcharged by reason of any gross 
  or manifest error in the preparation of the assessment roll that was an error 
  of fact&#133;but not an error in judgment in making the assessment&#133;."</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant (referring to the three Friedberg entities) was originally 
  assessed for business tax under s. 7(1)(b) of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. A. 31, at the 75% rate as "other financial business" for the 1993 
  to 1997 taxation years. However, following the release of the decision of the 
  Court of Appeal in Regional Assessment Commissioner, Region No. 9 v. Templeton 
  Management Ltd. (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 539, the Assessment Commissioner agreed, 
  applying the decision to the business conducted by the appellant, that the appellant 
  should have been assessed at the 50% rate as an "agent" under s. 7(1)(f)(i). 
  The appellant had assessment appeals outstanding for the 1993 and 1997 years 
  and the assessment was corrected in respect of those years. The appellant had 
  not appealed its assessments for the 1994, 1995 and 1996 years, and therefore 
  sought a refund of the taxes for those years under s. 443 of the Municipal Act. 
  The city denied the application for refund and the denial was upheld on judicial 
  review by the Divisional Court. The appellant appeals, with leave, from that 
  decision.</p>
<p>
  [3] For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, quash the decision 
  of the city that the refund application is invalid under s. 443(7)(b) of the 
  Municipal Act, and order that the city council consider the application for 
  a partial refund of business taxes for the years 1994 to 1996 under s. 443(10), 
  in accordance with the appellant's application and these reasons.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant conducts business as an investment dealer and portfolio manager. 
  A significant part of its business involves acting as agent either for investors 
  or for mutual funds, thereby earning brokerage commissions and fund management 
  fees. </p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant's original premises were located at 347 Bay St. in Toronto, 
  and in the summer of 1994 the appellant also began occupying additional leased 
  premises in BCE Place. In respect of those new premises, the appellant only 
  received Notices of Omitted Assessments for business tax for the 1994, 1995 
  and 1996 taxation years in 1996, and the appellant paid those tax bills promptly. 
  It did not appeal the assessments for those years for either the BCE Place or 
  the Bay Street premises.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant retained a tax consultant to prepare appeals for the 1997 
  taxation year, on the basis that it should have been taxed as a retailer at 
  the 30 percent rate. However, the appellant subsequently learned of the then 
  recently released Templeton Management decision of this court from its new consultant, 
  Milton Drash, who approached the Regional Assessment Commissioner to discuss 
  the application of that case to the appellant's business. In March 1998, Mr. 
  Drash met with Colin Eldridge, the acting Regional Assessment Commissioner. 
  He showed Mr. Eldridge the appellant's financial statements from 1992 to 1997, 
  which confirmed that 75 percent of the appellant's revenue was from brokerage 
  commissions and management fees, as well as other documentation describing the 
  appellant's business and corporate structure in order to demonstrate that the 
  appellant was a financial agent. Mr. Drash also provided Mr. Eldridge with the 
  Templeton decision, which held that where a financial institution operates as 
  an agent, it is entitled to be taxed as an agent at the 50 percent tax rate.</p>
<p>
  [7] There is a slight conflict in the evidence as to whether there were one 
  or two meetings between Mr. Drash and Mr. Eldridge, and whether Mr. Eldridge 
  received quick legal advice regarding the applicability of the Templeton decision 
  at the March meeting, or whether he consulted the commission's lawyer after 
  one meeting and made his decision later after receiving the legal advice. There 
  are no written records or file at the commission dealing with this matter. </p>
<p>
  [8] In any event, Mr. Eldridge agreed that the proper assessment rate for the 
  appellant was the 50 percent "agent" rate and not the 75 percent "other 
  financial business" rate, and Minutes of Settlement were prepared and executed 
  in respect of the 1997 assessment appeal and in respect of an outstanding appeal 
  for the 1993 year. The Assessment Review Board issued its confirmatory decisions 
  later that year.</p>
<p>
  [9] With no outstanding assessment appeal for the 1994 to 1996 assessment years, 
  Mr. Drash sought to recover the overpayment of taxes for those years, paid based 
  on the incorrect classification of the appellant at the 75 percent taxation 
  rate, by seeking a refund under s. 443 of the Municipal Act. For that purpose, 
  Mr. Drash attempted to obtain confirmation from Mr. Eldridge that the basis 
  of the change to the assessments for 1993 and 1997 was the facts and documentation 
  presented to him at the meeting in March. They had a telephone conversation 
  followed up by a letter dated November 30, 1998 to Mr. Eldridge, which he signed 
  back on December 9, 1998 and returned to Mr. Drash. Again there is a conflict 
  in the evidence, as Mr. Eldridge denied that he understood that the letter was 
  to be used for a s. 443 application and took the position in the application 
  that he had told Mr. Drash that he did not believe that such an application 
  was available in the circumstances. Mr. Drash's evidence is that Mr. Eldridge 
  confirmed that the change in assessment category was based on the facts and 
  documents presented by the appellant to the Regional Assessment Commissioner. 
  The letter records the documentation provided at the March, 1998 meeting and 
  says: </p>
<p class="indent"> As a result of the above facts, it was agreed that the business 
  assessment rate for Friedberg should be changed from 75 percent to 50 percent 
  for all locations and Minutes of Settlement giving effect to this change were 
  prepared and signed on March 20, 1998.</p>
<p class="indent">I trust the facts contained herein are complete and accurate, 
  and request your acknowledgement of same.</p>
<p>
  The letter is signed by Mr. Drash and the facts are acknowledged to be true 
  and accurate by Mr. Eldridge.</p>
<p>
  [10] When the city received the s. 443 application, which included the letter 
  of November 30, 1998, it obtained reports from two assessors in respect of the 
  appellant's two locations. One report states "no recommendation", 
  while the other says: "443 application improper vehicle for business assessment 
  reduction. Attached notices of decision relate to s. 40 Assessment Act appeals. 
  This assessor lacks jurisdiction to make a recommendation." Ultimately, 
  the Assessment Commissioner, Mr. Ridding, advised the city that he would not 
  confirm an error in the assessments as required by s. 443(7) and, on that basis, 
  in a letter dated July 18, 2000, the city denied the refund requests.</p>
<p>
  [11] On the application for judicial review, the Divisional Court rejected the 
  submission that the letter of November 30, 1998 constituted the confirmation 
  required by s. 443(7)(b).</p>
<p>
  [12] The Divisional Court's reasons were threefold: (1) the letter did not confirm 
  "an error in the assessment" in accordance with s. 443(7)(b); (2) 
  the appellant was obliged to seek judicial review of the decision of the Assessment 
  Commissioner and not the decision of the city; and (3) the court was not bound 
  to follow the decision in Emco Ltd. v. Ontario (Regional Assessment Commissioner, 
  Region No. 25) (1997), 100 O.A.C. 293, because it was distinguishable, as it 
  involved a mathematical error and not a question that required an analysis of 
  facts and law.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES</p>
<p>(1) Did the Divisional Court err in its interpretation of this court's decision 
  in Emco in respect of the type of error that can attract a refund under s. 443 
  of the Municipal Act?</p>
<p>(2) Did the Divisional Court err by misapplying s. 443(7)(b) of the Municipal 
  Act?</p>
<p>(3) Did the Divisional Court err in its interpretation of this court's decision 
  in Emco by requiring the appellant to seek judicial review of the decision of 
  the Assessment Commissioner rather than of the decision made by the city?</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>Issue 1</p>
<p> [13] The statutory framework for the analysis is contained in s. 443 of the 
  Municipal Act and s. 40 of the Assessment Act, which provided at the relevant 
  time:<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> </p>

  of the Assessment Act, in either of those years or in the year in which an application 
  is made under this section, but where an error is made subsequent to all such

<p>
  [14] This court faced a very similar question regarding the interpretation and 
  application of s. 443 of the Municipal Act in the 1997 case of Emco, supra. 
  Emco sold plumbing supplies from a London outlet and had been paying business 
  tax at the 75% rate as a "wholesale merchant" under s. 7(1)(b) of 
  the Assessment Act. For 1990, the assessment was changed to the 50% rate under 
  s. 7(1)(e) of the Act: "business of selling goods and services through 
  a chain of more than five outlets." This change was made in response to 
  a letter from Emco to the city of London at the end of 1989, seeking a reduction 
  of its business tax rate on the basis that the company operated out of 17 locations 
  in Ontario and therefore qualified for the rate applicable under s. 7(1)(e).</p>
<p>
  [15] The city of London taxation department immediately noted the reduction 
  requested on the letter. Subsequently, in January, 1990, the Ministry of Revenue 
  sent a memo to all Regional Assessment Commissioners in Ontario, advising that 
  Emco operated out of 17 locations in Ontario and that it should be assessed 
  under s. 7(1)(e). In 1999, Emco received a refund for its overcharge from the 
  city of Waterloo under s. 496(a) (later s. 443) of the Municipal Act. Emco applied 
  in November 1990 to the city of London for a similar refund for the 1998 and 
  1999 years.</p>
<p>
  [16] However, the Regional Assessment Commissioner took the position that determination 
  of the business tax rate is a judgment made by the assessor based on the information 
  available at the time the assessment is made and is not an error of fact under 
  s. 443(1). The Regional Assessment Commissioner therefore refused to confirm 
  to the city of London that an error was made in the preparation of the assessment 
  roll, as required by s. 443(7) as a precondition for a refund. The city of London 
  so advised Emco, resulting in its application to the Divisional Court. That 
  application, as framed, sought judicial review of the decision of the Regional 
  Assessment Commissioner and not of the decision of the city.</p>
<p>
  [17] There was evidence provided by the Assessment Commissioner on the application, 
  that the reason the Emco assessment was changed was because the assessment authorities 
  had originally taken the position that s. 7(1)(e) of the Assessment Act did 
  not apply to chains of wholesalers, then made a policy decision in 1990 reversing 
  that position. The Divisional Court accepted the position of the Assessment 
  Commissioner that the change in assessment was the result of a change in opinion 
  by the tax authorities as to the proper classification of Emco's business.</p>
<p>
  [18] However, the Court of Appeal took a different view. It rejected the evidence 
  of the change of policy because it was hearsay and because it conflicted with 
  the apparent chain of events in respect of Emco. The court held that if the 
  pre-1990 assessment was made based on the information gathered at the time, 
  then that information must have been in error because once the Commissioner 
  (and the city) learned that there were 17 outlets in Ontario, the assessment 
  was immediately changed for 1990 and subsequent years. The court therefore concluded 
  that the assessments for 1998 and 1999 were made based on erroneous information, 
  and that the error was an error of fact. </p>
<p>
  [19] The Divisional Court in the within application characterized the error 
  in Emco as a mathematical error of fact, as distinguished from this case, where 
  it concluded that "the decision to enter into the Minutes of Settlement 
  for the years 1993 and 1997 required an analysis of facts and law."</p>
<p>
  [20] Section 443 was added to the Municipal Act in 1988, and was in addition 
  to s. 442. Section 442(1) provided for an application to the municipal council 
  for the cancellation, reduction or refund of taxes levied in the year of the 
  application, for various reasons, including: (f) "overcharge[d] by reason 
  of any gross or manifest error that is a clerical error, the transposition of 
  figures, a typographical error or similar type of error, but not an error in 
  judgment in making the assessment upon which the taxes have been levied." 
  Section 443 extended the relief back two years prior to the application, again 
  for "overcharge by reason of any gross or manifest error in the preparation 
  of the assessment roll&#133;" However, in this new section, the requisite 
  type of errors were not limited to clerical errors but they had to be errors 
  of fact. The section goes on to provide: "that was an error of fact, which 
  may include but is not limited to, clerical errors, the transposition of figures 
  or typographical errors, but not an error in judgment in making the assessment 
  upon which the taxes have been levied" [emphasis added]. The refund power 
  given to the municipal council is intended to be remedial in order to allow 
  justice to be done to a taxpayer who has been overcharged: St. Catharines (Assessment 
  Commissioner) v. Interlake Tissue Mills Co., [1970] S.C.R. 441 at 446.</p>
<p>
  [21] Under the legislative scheme, a municipal council's power to correct errors 
  is limited to clerical and factual errors because it is the Assessment Commissioner's 
  role to make judgments relating to the making of the assessment, and there is 
  an appeal process under the Assessment Act for errors of that type in respect 
  of the current year. Also, for future years, a taxpayer can attempt to convince 
  the Assessment Commissioner to change the taxpayer's business taxation classification. 
  However, the municipality does not control the assessment but only the taxes 
  themselves, and its power is limited to considering specific requests for relief 
  from taxes acknowledged to have been improperly levied in the current year or 
  the previous two years.</p>
<p>
  [22] The question whether an error that resulted in the incorrect categorization 
  of a business is an error of fact or an error of judgment can be a difficult 
  one, as the commissioner's role is to apply the statute, as interpreted by the 
  case law, to the facts. However, in this case, as in the Emco case, the Assessment 
  Commissioner was provided with the facts of the taxpayer's business during the 
  period from 1992 to 1997 and, based on those facts, together with consideration 
  of the applicable case law, the Commissioner determined that the appellant's 
  business category was in error, and that the appellant should have been placed 
  in a different category with a significantly lower assessment rate.</p>
<p>
  [23] In my view, this case is on all fours with Emco, in that the error was 
  that at the time of the assessments for the relevant years, the Assessment Commissioner 
  did not know the full facts regarding the appellant's business, which demonstrated 
  that the business clearly fell into the "agency" category. Of course, 
  even if the business could also fit within another category, there is a residual 
  presumption in favour of the taxpayer, who is entitled to the lower assessment 
  rate: Quebec (Communaut&eacute; urbaine v. Corp. Notre Dame de Bon-Secours, 
  [1994] 3 S.C.R. 3; Templeton, supra. Mr. Eldridge confirmed on cross-examination 
  that had the appellant appealed its assessments for the 1994, 1995 and 1996 
  years, the assessments would have been changed.</p>
<p>
  Issue 2</p>
<p>
  [24] The Divisional Court also rejected the appellant's application on two related 
  procedural grounds. The first was that the November 30, 1998 letter from the 
  acting Regional Assessment Commissioner, Mr. Eldridge, did not constitute the 
  confirmation required by s. 443(7)(b) of an error in the assessment. In this 
  case, the appellant took a rather unusual approach in obtaining the required 
  confirmation in writing from the Assessment Commissioner and submitting it with 
  the application, rather than waiting for the city to seek and obtain the Assessment 
  Commissioner's view of the application on the forms it did ultimately obtain. 
  However, I agree with the appellant that there is no required format for the 
  confirmation and, in this case, the appellant obtained the Assessment Commissioner's 
  agreement in writing that the change in the appellant's business assessment 
  category was based on the facts presented to the Commissioner. Although the 
  word "error" was not used, the effect is the same. Later, the Assessment 
  Commissioner's office reverted to the position it had taken in the Emco case 
  that choosing the appropriate business assessment category is a question of 
  judgment and therefore no tax refund should be given under s. 443. In addition, 
  in his evidence on the application, Mr. Eldridge took the position that he never 
  agreed that a s. 443 refund was available in the circumstances of this case. 
  However, the issue for confirmation is not the opinion of the Assessment Commissioner 
  as to the applicability of s. 443, but only whether there was an error in the 
  assessment referred to in the application. The November 30, 1998 letter effectively 
  constituted such confirmation.</p>
<p>
  Issue 3</p>
<p>
  [25] The other procedural issue that concerned the Divisional Court in this 
  case was the identity of the respondent. In Emco, the respondent was the Regional 
  Assessment Commissioner and it was the refusal of that official to provide the 
  confirmation that was nominally the subject of the judicial review, although 
  the decision that was attacked was the city's refusal to refund the taxes.</p>
<p>
  [26] In this case, the appellant's position, which has been endorsed on this 
  appeal, was that there was confirmation of the error by the Regional Assessment 
  Commissioner as required by s. 443(7)(b); therefore, it was the city's refusal 
  to acknowledge that confirmation and proceed to consider the application for 
  the refund that was the subject of the judicial review.</p>
<p>
  [27] I am satisfied that the appellant is entitled to its remedy in this matter 
  and that the procedure it adopted was not inappropriate on the facts of this 
  case. </p>
<p>
  [28] The appellant has asked for an order requiring the city to make a partial 
  refund of business taxes for the 1994, 1995 and 1996 taxation years. However, 
  because s. 443(10) gave the municipal council the authority to determine the 
  refund application, the proper order is for the city council to consider the 
  application based on the findings and conclusions of this court.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [29] I would therefore allow the appeal from the Divisional Court, and substitute 
  an order quashing the decision of the city that the appellant's application 
  for a partial refund is invalid under s. 443(7)(b), and requiring the city council 
  to consider the application under s. 443(10), applying the findings and conclusions 
  of this court to the issue.</p>
<p>
  [30] The costs of the appeal shall be to the appellant on the partial indemnity 
  scale, fixed in the amount of $8,000 for both the leave to appeal application 
  and the appeal, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
