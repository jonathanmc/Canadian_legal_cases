<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Edith Whiteman appeals from the judgment of Justice Robertson dated July 
  24, 2003 ordering her to remove any trailers and motor homes from her property 
  in the Township of North Frontenac within fourteen days. In a brief handwritten 
  endorsement, the application judge rejected Ms. Whiteman's claim that she has 
  a legal nonconforming right to continue to use the property as she has since 
  acquiring the property in 1977, and declined to grant Ms. Whiteman equitable 
  relief.</p>
<p>
  [2] The evidence of Ms. Whiteman is that shortly after purchasing the property 
  in 1977 with her late husband, they and other family members parked five trailers 
  on the property. Ms. Whiteman and her husband, her children, and her brothers 
  and sisters-in-law have used the property for summer recreation since that time.</p>
<p>
  [3] Ms. Whiteman's evidence also indicates that, while the trailers are used 
  in the summer, they remain on the property through the winter. A motor home 
  replaced one of the original trailers in 1989, and is removed from the property 
  each year from October until May. The application judge found that the original 
  five trailers, except possibly one, have been replaced.</p>
<p>
  [4] The affidavits of Christopher Snider, a neighbour, and of Kenneth Lindey, 
  a By-law Enforcement Officer for the Township, confirm that at least four trailers 
  remain on the Whiteman property on a year-round basis. The trailers are connected 
  to water, power and septic systems on the property and cannot be removed because 
  of landscaping features.</p>
<p>
  [5] At the time that Ms. Whiteman acquired the property, By-law 624 applied 
  to the property. As Ms. Whiteman's claim to a legal non-conforming use originates 
  under this By-law, it is necessary to reproduce certain provisions.</p>
<p>
  [6] Under By-law 624, the property was zoned &quot;Resort/Vacation.&quot; Section 
  5.1(a) stated: &quot;No building or structure shall hereafter be erected or 
  altered &#133; except in conformity with the provisions of this By-law.&quot; 
  Sections 4.2(b) and 6.1 stipulated that &quot;not more than one Seasonal Dwelling 
  House&quot; could be erected and used on land zoned &quot;Resort/Vacation&quot;. 
  Section 3(15) defined &quot;Seasonal Dwelling House&quot; to mean &quot;a single-family 
  dwelling house used as an occasional resort for recreation, relaxation or vacation 
  purposes, but not occupied continuously or as a principal residence.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [7] By-law 685, which came into effect on January 5, 1989, replaced By-law 624. 
  By-law 685 zones the property &quot;Seasonal Residential&quot; and permits the 
  use of &quot;a seasonal dwelling&quot;. A &quot;seasonal dwelling&quot; is defined 
  to mean &quot;a dwelling used as a secondary place of residence for seasonal 
  vacations and recreational purposes and not as the principal residence of the 
  owner or occupant.&quot; Section 8.20 defines &quot;dwelling&quot; as follows: 
  &quot;&#133; a building occupied, or capable of being occupied, as a home or 
  residence by one or more persons and containing only one dwelling unit. This 
  definition shall not include a modular home.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [8] By-law 685, unlike By-law 624, specifically refers to trailers and mobile 
  homes. By-law 685 was amended by By-law 19-95, which amended the definition 
  of trailer and allows the temporary use of a trailer as long as it is located 
  on a vacant lot, complies with all zoning provisions, and a permit is obtained 
  from the Township if the trailer remains in place for more than eight consecutive 
  weeks. Ms. Whiteman concedes that she is in breach of the current by-law as 
  amended, as all the trailers are on the property for more than eight consecutive 
  weeks without a permit.</p>
<p>
  [9] Counsel for Ms. Whiteman submitted that Ms. Whiteman's use of the property 
  was in compliance with By-law 624 and that she acquired a legal non-conforming 
  use in relation to the trailers when By-law 685 replaced By-law 624. He argued 
  that trailers are not buildings and pointed out that s. 34 (4) of the Planning 
  Act did not deem trailers to be structures until 1983. He submits that Ms. Whiteman 
  and her family have used the property for general recreation purposes and, according 
  to the terms of the legislation in place in 1977, cannot be said to have placed 
  any buildings or structures on the property. Therefore, he continued, Ms. Whiteman 
  has a legal nonconforming right to continue to use the property in the same 
  way it has been used since 1977 even though subsequent legislation deemed trailers 
  to be structures and the subsequent by-law regulates trailers specifically.</p>
<p>
  [10] We do not accept the characterization of Ms. Whiteman's use of the property 
  as one involving activity but not structures. The evidence that the five trailers 
  are permanently attached to the property and were used by several families provides 
  an adequate basis to conclude that the trailers breached By-law 624's stipulation 
  that there be only one single family Seasonal Dwelling House on the property. 
  In our view, By-law 624 permitted one trailer on the property to be used seasonally 
  as a single family dwelling and, accordingly, Ms. Whiteman acquired legal nonconforming 
  rights under By-law 624 with respect to one trailer only. We therefore agree 
  with the application judge's decision in relation to four of the five trailers 
  (including the motor home) that are on the property.</p>
<p>
  [11] In view of our conclusion that Ms. Whiteman acquired a legal non-conforming 
  use for one trailer under By-law 624, it is unnecessary to consider the legal 
  effects of the replacement of the four trailers that took place after By-law 
  685 replaced By-law 624, or of section 2.3 of By-law 685, which the appellant 
  raised for the first time during the argument of the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [12] Furthermore, assuming that equitable principles apply in the context of 
  the enforcement of statutes, we are not persuaded that the application judge 
  made any legal error in declining to exercise any discretionary equitable jurisdiction 
  in Ms. Whiteman's favour. At its highest, the evidence is that the Township 
  Council, at a meeting in August 1979 attended by the Whitemans, took the position 
  that having two trailers on the property did not contravene By-law 624. This 
  evidence is not a sufficient basis to permit Ms. Whiteman to continue to have 
  five trailers, used by several families and permanently attached to the property, 
  and to remain in violation of the current by-law's trailer permit requirements 
  or the current by-law's stipulation that there be only one seasonal dwelling 
  on the property.</p>
<p>
  [13] The appeal is allowed in part. The application judge's judgment is amended 
  only to the extent that one of the trailers or the motor home currently on the 
  property is exempt from the operation and enforcement of the judgment.</p>
<p>
  [14] As success is divided, there will be no order as to costs of the appeal.</p>
