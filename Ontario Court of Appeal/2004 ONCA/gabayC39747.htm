<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>Nature of Appeal</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant appeals from the dismissal of her claim for damages for negligent 
  misrepresentation. The appellant also seeks leave to appeal the costs judgment 
  of Rouleau J. dated June 9, 2003, where the appellant was ordered to pay costs 
  to the respondents. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant brought an action against the respondents for investment losses 
  sustained when she invested in Nabtech Trading Corporation and subsequently 
  in Target Nabtech Inc. ("Target Nabtech"), a company in which her 
  cousin, Murray Posner, was Vice- President and had an interest. Target Nabtech 
  was created in March 1992 through the merger of Nabtech Trading Corp. and another 
  company, Target Importers Inc.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant claimed that the respondent, Gerry Goldberg, made negligent 
  misrepresentations to her concerning the affairs of Target Nabtech, and that 
  she relied upon these misrepresentations to her detriment. The appellant alleges 
  that she invested approximately $825,000.00 in Target Nabtech as a result of 
  Mr. Goldberg's alleged representations. The company failed in 1996 and the appellant's 
  investment in the company was lost. </p>
<p>
  [4] The respondent, Gerry Goldberg was the accountant for Target Nabtech. He 
  first met the plaintiff at a meeting held at Target Nabtech's premises in August 
  1992. At that time he was a partner of the respondent, Doane Raymond Chartered 
  Accountant Management Consultants. One of the principals of Target Nabtech asked 
  Mr. Goldberg to explain the difference between preference shares and a loan. 
  He did so. There is no suggestion that he erred in the explanation he gave. 
  At a later point in the meeting Mr. Posner told Mrs. Gabay that if she invested 
  in preference shares she would share in the profits of the company. Mr. Goldberg 
  was concerned that this was not the case. After the meeting, Mr. Goldberg spoke 
  to one of the principals of the company and received an assurance that she would 
  be treated as a 25 per cent investor and participate in 25 per cent of the profits. 
  The trial judge accepted this evidence. </p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant submits that Mr. Goldberg had an accountant-client relationship 
  with Mrs. Gabay as a result of the explanation he gave, and that he ought at 
  least to have told her he could not advise her as to whether to make the investment 
  and that she should obtain independent legal advice.</p>
<p>
  [6] At paras. 66 and 70 of his reasons the trial judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  When the plaintiff attended that meeting she had already invested personally 
  or on behalf of her mother, well over $300,000. The reason for the meeting was 
  not to consider the making of that investment but rather the structuring of 
  it. There was no indication at the meeting that she was reconsidering her position. 
  There was no discussion of the merits of the investment nor any advice given 
  concerning the appropriateness of making or not making the investment. All of 
  the discussion centred around the amount of investment required to be a one-quarter 
  partner and how it should be structured. </p>
<p class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;There was nothing to alert Goldberg that the plaintiff was relying on 
  him to do anything other than to inform her of the different treatment of investments 
  made by way of preference shares or by way of loan. The plaintiff admitted that 
  this was the first time she met Goldberg. She did not, at that meeting or thereafter 
  retain Goldberg as an investment advisor. By her conduct at the meeting it was 
  clear that she had already committed to making the investments and was not seeking 
  nor expecting any confirmation or comment from Goldberg.</p>
<p>[7] Given these findings, we are of the opinion that there was no accountant-client 
  relationship between Mr. Goldberg and Mrs. Gabay at that time.</p>
<p>
  [8] After the first meeting in August 1992, the appellant's cousin suggested 
  she retain Mr. Goldberg as her accountant to do her income tax returns, and 
  she did. Mrs. Gabay testified that she met with Mr Goldberg a second time in 
  August 1992 at her home. She testified she was told that the company was a good 
  small business. The trial judge found that this statement was made. The appellant 
  submits that the 1992 financial statement shows that in a three?month period, 
  January to March 1992, the company lost $122,000. The appellant says that Mr. 
  Goldberg had an obligation to tell Mrs. Gabay that the company was in financial 
  difficulty, not the opposite.</p>
<p>
  [9] The financial statement that the appellant relies on relates to one of the 
  predecessors of the company and not to the newly formed company. The newly formed 
  company had a small profit in the year in question. The trial judge therefore 
  correctly concluded that this was not a misrepresentation at the time it was 
  made.</p>
<p>
  [10] In addition, Mrs. Gabay attended a later meeting at which she was told 
  that the company was in financial difficulty and she knew that putting further 
  money into the company would be risky. She continued to invest in the company. 
  There was, accordingly, ample evidence upon which the trial judge could conclude 
  that in any event Mrs. Gabay did not rely on any representation by Mr. Goldberg 
  in deciding to continue investing in the company. Accordingly, we would dismiss 
  the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [11] With respect to the costs at trial, the parties are agreed that the trial 
  costs of counsel to Goldberg and to Schwartz, Levitsky, Feldman ought to be 
  reduced to $106,394.74, while those of Doane Raymond should be reduced to $30,318.79. 
  An order will go allowing the appeal with respect to costs to this extent. </p>
<p>
  [12] We are of the view that the appropriate amount in the circumstances is 
  $8,500 for each of the respondents. </p>
