<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] As the motions judge pointed out the question before the court is not whether 
  the statements made in the Toronto Star articles are true, false, fair comment 
  or, as counsel for the plaintiff suggests, a sensational exploitation of junk 
  science. We have no doubt that the many police officers who carry out their 
  duties professionally and abhor racism regard the allegations as offensive and 
  are concerned about the consequences to their reputations and relationships 
  in the community; however, that is not the issue before us either.</p>
<p>[2] The law is well settled that an action for defamation is a personal tort 
  based on injury to one's own reputation. A plaintiff in a defamation action 
  must show that the publication complained of is reasonably capable of referring 
  to him or her. The only question before this court is whether it is plain and 
  obvious that the plaintiffs cannot succeed in showing that the articles complained 
  of could reasonably be understood to refer to them as individuals or to any 
  other particular member of the Toronto Police Service. The appellants urged 
  us to adopt the &quot;intensity of suspicion&quot; test discussed in Butler 
  v. Southam Inc. (2001) N.S.J. No. 332 (N.S.C.A.). As Cromwell J.A. noted in 
  that case &quot;this 'intensity of suspicion' approach is consistent with Lord 
  Porter's speech in Knupffer and does not describe some new or different test&quot; 
  (para. 59). We agree. </p>
<p>[3] The articles complained of use general language such as &quot;police&quot; 
  or &quot;Toronto Police&quot; and are about systemic racism. The articles do 
  not name or identify any particular police officer. It is plain and obvious 
  to us that the articles read all together, or individually, are not capable 
  of being reasonably understood to suggest that each individual member of the 
  Toronto Police is &quot;racist&quot; or engages in &quot;racial profiling&quot;. 
  The motions judge conducted a careful analysis of the legal issues advanced 
  by the appellants and rejected them. We agree substantially with his reasons 
  and consequently this appeal must be dismissed</p>
<p>[4] We see no reason why costs should not follow the event before the motions 
  judge. The plaintiffs' appeal of the motions judge's costs order is also dismissed.</p>
<p>[5] The respondents are entitled to their costs of the appeal on a partial 
  indemnity basis fixed in the amount $15,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
