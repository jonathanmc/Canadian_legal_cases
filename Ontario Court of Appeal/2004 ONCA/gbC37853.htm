<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] On receipt of the jury's request for a transcript of the evidence of the 
  three main witnesses, the trial judge, unfortunately without fully discussing 
  the matter with counsel, indicated that this request could not be met and the 
  jury had to try to make their request specific. While the trial judge was entitled 
  to attempt to get the jury to be specific, she was not entitled to foreclose 
  further help to them. </p>
<p>[2] In our view, despite the context, the response given would inevitably have 
  communicated to the jury that not only could the transcript not be provided, 
  but that unless the jury could be specific as to the pieces of evidence they 
  needed to be refreshed on, no help could be provided to them. This effectively 
  foreclosed the option of refreshing their memory on all the evidence of the 
  three witnesses by reading it back or providing a summary of it if the jury 
  found it could not be specific.</p>
<p>[3] In light of R. v. Kiyoshk (1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 478 (Ont. C.A.) that 
  represents reversible error.</p>
<p>[4] The conviction must be set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>
