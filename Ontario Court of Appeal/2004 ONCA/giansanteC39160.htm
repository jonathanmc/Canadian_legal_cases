<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This appeal must be allowed.</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge found as a fact that in August of 1998, Mr. Giansante became 
  aware of the specific requirements of DaimlerChrysler's Integrity Code which 
  provided:</p>
<p class="indent">The use of outside concerns to provide goods or perform services 
  of a personal nature is strongly discouraged, even though paid for by the employee. 
  If unavoidable (e.g. vehicle service/repair provided by a Chrysler dealer), 
  fair market value must be paid for the goods or services, and the payment must 
  be documented.</p>
<p>[3] The trial judge further found that the fence that Mr. Giansante arranged 
  to have constructed for him by DaimlerChrysler's supplier was completed in October 
  1998, that payment was due upon completion, and that Mr. Giansante had not paid 
  for the fence before he was advised on December 11, 1998 that he would be terminated.</p>
<p>[4] The trial judge did find that Mr. Giansante &quot;considered the subject 
  of the fence wrapped up in the discussion which took place in respect of the 
  pool&quot; and that this provided a reasonable explanation of why he did not 
  mention the fence, which was then under construction, to the investigators. 
  However, this finding does not explain why Mr. Giansante failed to make and 
  document payment for the fence when payment became due.</p>
<p>[5] The trial judge went on to find that &quot;While it may have been preferable, 
  as against the standard expressed in the Code, for the plaintiff to have documented 
  the arrangement for the fence, ultimately the arrangement was documented in 
  the final invoice.&quot; This is an erroneous interpretation and application 
  of DaimlerChrysler's Integrity Code. The Code required documentation of payment, 
  not merely documentation of the contractual arrangement for payment.</p>
<p>[6] We are satisfied that on the findings of fact made by the trial judge, 
  Mr. Giansante was in clear breach of the Code after August 1998. Given his senior 
  management position, the conflict of interest he created when he arranged with 
  DaimlerChrysler's supplier to provide an in-ground swimming pool, a fence and 
  landscaping compromised the employment relationship. We find that DaimlerChrysler 
  had just cause to terminate his employment. The judgment in favour of Mr. Giansante 
  is set aside, and his action is dismissed with the defendant's costs at trial 
  to be assessed.</p>
<p>[7] Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment and order 
  that the action be dismissed with costs. The appellant is awarded its costs 
  of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis fixed at $15,000.00 plus disbursements 
  and GST. </p>
