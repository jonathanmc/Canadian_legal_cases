<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We are satisfied that the test for ineffective assistance of counsel has 
  been met. The statement attributed to the nurse was clear evidence of consent. 
  It was the only extrinsic evidence to support the appellant's position. The 
  failure to interview the nurse and to cross-examine the complainant on the statement 
  cannot, in our view, be attributed to reasonable professional judgment. The 
  trial counsel's explanations for these decisions do not bear up under scrutiny 
  and are inconsistent with counsel's later futile attempt to lead hearsay evidence 
  of the nurse's statement.</p>
<p>[2] We are also satisfied that the appellant has shown that the reliability 
  of the trial's results may have been compromised. P.C. Roger's attempt to explain 
  away the express words of her note of the nurse's statement is not reasonable. 
  Had the complainant been confronted with this statement, the result of the case 
  may have been different. That statement to the nurse supported the defence position 
  that the complainant had reinterpreted the events surrounding the sexual act 
  in light of the quite brutal and unprovoked assault that followed. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly we would allow the appeal from conviction for sexual assault 
  and order a new trial. </p>
<p>[4] The trial judge imposed five years imprisonment concurrent for the aggravated 
  assault and the sexual assault. In view of our conclusion on the sexual assault, 
  it is necessary to review the five-year sentence imposed for the aggravated 
  assault. For that purpose the fresh evidence is helpful. That evidence shows 
  that the appellant is confronting his alcohol problem and making excellent progress 
  with his rehabilitation. That said, the aggravated assault was an extremely 
  serious one, committed within a domestic context and committed only a very short 
  time after he was released, having assaulted this very same complainant. </p>
<p>[5] Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence for aggravated assault is granted, 
  the appeal is allowed and the sentence is reduced to four years imprisonment.</p>
