<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The Crown appeals from the decision of the trial judge to stay the charges 
  against the respondents on the basis that the respondents' s. 11(b) rights were 
  breached when the total delay between the charges and the trial date was thirty-three 
  months. We agree with the conclusion reached by the trial judge. </p>
<p>[2] At the outset of the trial the Crown conceded that there was no express 
  waiver of their s. 11(b) rights by the defendants and that the thirty-three 
  month delay required an inquiry. The trial judge focused on the institutional 
  delay caused by the failure of the preliminary inquiry judge, by the trial judge 
  himself as the assignment court judge, by the relevant trial coordinators and 
  by all counsel involved in failing at each point along the way to address the 
  delay issue before setting dates several months ahead in order to accommodate 
  the schedules of counsel or the court. </p>
<p>[3] In our view, the trial judge was correct, both in his conclusion that this 
  case reflected a culture that accepted delays as inevitable rather than recognizing 
  that dates must be set in order to accommodate s. 11(b) and to ensure that the 
  trial date is reached within a reasonable time, and in his observation that 
  the previously accepted lengthy adjournment delays are now completely unacceptable. 
  <br>
  [4] We would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
