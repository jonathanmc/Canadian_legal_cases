<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals the decision of the motions judge who dismissed Graywood 
  Investments Limited's (&quot;Graywood&quot;) claim on the basis that the Ontario 
  Energy Board (&quot;OEB&quot; or &quot;the Board&quot;) had exclusive jurisdiction 
  over the subject-matter of the claim and that the action amounted to an abuse 
  of process.</p>
<p>[2] Pursuant to its powers under the Ontario Energy Board Act, S.O. 1998, c. 
  15 (&quot;the Act&quot;), the OEB approved and published a Distribution System 
  Code dealing with conditions that a distributor of electricity must meet in 
  carrying out its obligations under its license. The OEB ruled that the Code 
  does not apply to projects &quot;that are the subject matter of an agreement 
  entered into before November 1, 2000.&quot;</p>
<p>[3] The essence of the dispute between Graywood and Toronto Hydro-Electric 
  Energy System Limited (&quot;Hydro&quot;) is whether Hydro was in breach of 
  its license in failing to apply the Code. In that regard, the motions judge 
  found, correctly in our view, that the dispute was one that fell squarely within 
  the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board under s. 75 of the Act.</p>
<p>[4] In the circumstances of this case, the determination of that dispute turned 
  on whether the parties had entered into an agreement, within the meaning of 
  the Code, prior to November 1, 2000. That was a matter for the Board to decide, 
  in accordance with its authority under s. 19(1) of the Act.</p>
<p>[5] This action by Graywood is based on the same fundamental issue as to whether 
  there was an agreement between the parties prior to November 1, 2000, within 
  the meaning of the Code.</p>
<p>[6] The application for judicial review brought by Graywood against Hydro and 
  the OEB is also based on the same issue. </p>
<p>[7] In our view, the fundamental issue was within the exclusive jurisdiction 
  of the OEB. The complaint of Graywood may be a matter of judicial review, but 
  this action is nothing more than an attempt to circumvent the OEB's decision.</p>
<p>[8] We agree with the conclusion of the motions judge.</p>
<p>[9] We would dismiss this appeal with costs fixed at $9,000.</p>
<p>Signed: &quot;J.-M. Labrosse J.A.&quot;<br>
