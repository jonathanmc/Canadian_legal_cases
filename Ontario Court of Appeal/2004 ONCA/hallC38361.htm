<p>On appeal from the order dated May 10, 2002, of Justice James Greco of the 
  Ontario Court of Justice, dismissing the Crown's dangerous offender application. 
  </p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [1] The respondent pleaded guilty to 43 charges, including one count of sexual 
  assault, one count of sexual interference, seven counts of invitation to sexual 
  touching, and 34 counts relating to the possession, distribution or importation 
  of child pornography. The offences occurred between 1989 when the respondent 
  was 13 years old and November 1999 when he was arrested by the police. </p>
<p> [2] The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The trial judge dismissed 
  that application. Having regard to the respondent's pre-sentence incarceration 
  of almost 30 months, the trial judge declined to impose a further jail term. 
  He placed the respondent on probation for 3 years on strict terms, imposed lifetime 
  prohibitions under s. 161 of the Criminal Code and made a DNA databank order 
  against the respondent.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> </p>
<p>
  [3] The Crown appeals on a question of law alone pursuant to s. 759(2). The 
  Crown submits that the trial judge erred in his interpretation of the dangerous 
  offender provisions and that on a proper interpretation, the respondent should 
  be found to be a dangerous offender and sentenced to detention in a penitentiary 
  for an indeterminate period. Alternatively, the Crown argues that the trial 
  judge should have concluded that the respondent was a long-term offender and 
  imposed a sentence in accordance with s. 753.1(3) of the Criminal Code. In the 
  further alternative, the Crown submits that if neither the dangerous offender 
  nor the long-term offender designation is appropriate, the sentence imposed 
  by the trial judge was inadequate and should be substantially increased. This 
  relief is sought under s. 687 of the Criminal Code.</p>
<p>
  [4] I would allow the appeal. I agree with the Crown that the trial judge erred 
  in law in his interpretation of the dangerous offender provisions. However, 
  on the findings of fact made by the trial judge which are untainted by his legal 
  error, the appropriate disposition is a finding that the respondent is a long-term 
  offender. </p>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  The Offences</p>
<p>
  [5] The respondent came to the attention of the police in November 1999. A police 
  officer posing as a person with an interest in child pornography began chatting 
  on line with the respondent. The respondent sent child pornography to the officer, 
  spoke of his sexual contact with children, and eventually agreed to meet the 
  officer. He was arrested at the meeting. Further investigation revealed a long 
  history of sexual misconduct with children.</p>
<p>
  [6] In 1989 when the respondent was 13 and living in Haileybury, he befriended 
  M.B., age five, and his older brother D.B., age eight. Over a lengthy period, 
  the respondent engaged in various sexual activities, including fellatio, with 
  the brothers. The sexual activity ended when the respondent moved away from 
  Haileybury.</p>
<p>
  [7] After his arrest in 1999, the respondent gave a statement to the police 
  in which he admitted that he had engaged in repeated sexual activity, including 
  fellatio, with two cousins in 1991-92. The respondent was about 16 years of 
  age. The victims were about nine years of age. These acts were not the subject 
  of separate charges. </p>
<p>
  [8] In the summer of 1997, the respondent, who was 21 years of age, returned 
  to Haileybury to live with a friend. Over a four-week time period he sexually 
  assaulted his friend's children some 50 to 60 times. His assaults on J.L., the 
  friend's 10 year old daughter, included digital penetration of her vagina and 
  cunnilingus. His assaults on K.L., his friend's 8 year old son, included mutual 
  masturbation. These activities led to the sexual assault and sexual interference 
  convictions. </p>
<p>
  [9] The respondent moved to Sault Ste. Marie in 1997. He frequented a park near 
  his apartment and struck up friendships with many children between the ages 
  of 9 and 11. He invited some of these children back to his apartment. At the 
  apartment, he gave the children cigarettes, and allowed them to watch movies. 
  Over time, the respondent showed the children pornography, including child pornography, 
  and played sexual games with them to remove their sexual inhibitions. He exposed 
  himself to some children in his apartment on one occasion and on another, masturbated 
  in front of a child. Some of the children began to have sexual contact with 
  each other, sometimes in the presence of the respondent. He talked to some of 
  the children about making a video with them. These activities led to the respondent's 
  convictions on the invitation to sexual touching charges. These charges involved 
  touching among the children and not between the children and the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [10] An examination of the respondent's computer and related software revealed 
  extensive child pornography related activity, including many pornographic images 
  of young children. </p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  The Legislation</p>
<p>
  [11] The dangerous offender provisions in Part XXIV of the Code have been through 
  various amendments. The most recent version came into force on August 1, 1997 
  (S.C. 1997, c. 17). The criteria governing the determination of whether an offender 
  is a dangerous offender are found in s. 752 and s. 753. The relevant subsections 
  are set out below.</p>
<p class="indent"> 752 In this Part,</p>
<p class="indent">"serious personal injury offences" means></p>
<p class="indent"> (a) an indictable offence, other than high treason, treason, 
  first degree murder or second degree murder, involving</p>
<p class="indent10"> (i) the use or attempted use of violence against another person, 
  or</p>
<p class="indent10"> (ii) conduct endangering or likely to endanger the life or 
  safety of another person or inflicting or likely to inflict severe psychological 
  damage upon another person,</p>
<p class="indent"> and for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment 
  for ten years or more, or</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) an offence or attempt to commit an offence mentioned in 
  section 271 (sexual assault), 272 (sexual assault with a weapon, threats to 
  a third party or causing bodily harm) or 273 (aggravated sexual assault).</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 753(1) The court may, on application made under this Part following 
  the filing of an assessment report under subsection 752.1(2), find the offender 
  to be a dangerous offender if it is satisfied</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) that the offence for which the offender has been convicted 
  is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (a) of the definition 
  of that expression in section 752 and the offender constitutes a threat to the 
  life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons on the basis 
  of evidence establishing</p>
<p class="indent10"> (i) a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which 
  the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing a failure 
  to restrain his or her behaviour and a likelihood of causing death or injury 
  to other persons, or inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons, 
  through failure in the future to restrain his or her behaviour,</p>
<p class="indent10"> (ii) a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the offender, 
  of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing 
  a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting 
  the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his or her behaviour, 
  or </p>
<p class="indent10"> (iii) any behaviour by the offender, associated with the offence 
  for which he or she has been convicted, that is of such a brutal nature as to 
  compel the conclusion that the offender's behaviour in the future is unlikely 
  to be inhibited by normal standards of behavioural restraint; or</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) that the offence for which the offender has been convicted 
  is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (b) of the definition 
  of that expression in section 752 and the offender, by his or her conduct in 
  any sexual matter including that involved in the commission of the offence for 
  which he or she has been convicted, has shown a failure to control his or her 
  sexual impulses and a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to other 
  persons through failure in the future to control his of her sexual impulses. 
</p>
<p>
  [12] Section 753(1) describes two paths to a finding that a person is a dangerous 
  offender. Section 753(1)(a) deals with offenders who have been convicted of 
  a "serious personal injury offence" as defined in s. 752(a). Broadly 
  speaking, serious personal injury offences under s. 752(a) are offences punishable 
  by at least 10 years in jail, but not carrying a minimum of life imprisonment, 
  that involve violence, the endangerment of the safety or life of others, or 
  the infliction or risk of infliction of severe psychological damage. If the 
  offender has been convicted of a "serious personal injury offence" 
  as defined in s. 752(a), the court must then determine whether the Crown has 
  established that the offender constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical 
  or mental well-being of other persons. The Crown can meet this burden by showing 
  that the offender fits within any of the three subcategories of s. 753(1)(a). 
  It is unnecessary to describe those provisions in detail. Generally speaking, 
  they look to the risk posed by the offender. </p>
<p>
  [13] The second route to a finding that a person is a dangerous offender is 
  set out in s. 753(1)(b). This section targets offenders who have committed any 
  of the sexual assault offences listed in s. 752(b), and who have by their conduct 
  in sexual matters shown a failure to control their sexual impulses, and a likelihood 
  of causing "injury, pain or other evil" to persons through the failure 
  in the future to control their sexual impulses. </p>
<p>
  [14] The criteria set out in s. 753(1)(a) and s. 753(1)(b) overlap. The Crown 
  argued that the respondent met both sets of criteria, however, it relied primarily 
  on s. 753(1)(b).</p>
<p> [15] Prior to the amendments to the dangerous offender provisions in 1997, 
  if an offender met the criteria,<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> the court 
  had a discretion as to whether to designate the offender a dangerous offender. 
  In addition, if the court did designate the person a dangerous offender, it 
  had a discretion to impose an indeterminate sentence or a definite sentence: 
  R. v. Lyons (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 29 (S.C.C.). Under the present provisions, 
  the second of those discretions is removed. Section 753(4) states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If the court finds an offender to be a dangerous offender, it shall impose a 
  sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period. </p>
<p> [16] The removal of the discretion to impose a definite sentence on a person 
  designated as a dangerous offender is explained in part by the creation of the 
  long-term offender status in the 1997 amendments. Under this designation, offenders 
  can be subject to up to ten years of supervision in the community following 
  completion of their jail terms. Section 753.1 as it read at the time of trial 
  provided in part:<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> </p>
<p class="indent"> 753.1 (1) The court may, on application made under this Part 
  following the filing of an assessment report under subsection 752.1(2), find 
  an offender to be a long-term offender if it is satisfied that </p>
<p class="indent">(a) it would be appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment 
  of two years or more for the offence of which the offender has been convicted;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) there is a substantial risk that the offender will reoffend; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of 
  the risk in the community.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The court shall be satisfied that there is a substantial 
  risk that the offender will reoffend if </p>
<p class="indent">(a) the offender has been convicted of an offence under section 
  151 (sexual interference), 152 (invitation to sexual touching) or 153 (sexual 
  exploitation), subsection 173(2) (exposure) or section 271 (sexual assault), 
  272 (sexual assault with a weapon) or 273 (aggravated sexual assault), or has 
  engaged in serious conduct of a sexual nature in the commission of another offence 
  of which the offender has been convicted; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the offender</p>
<p class="indent10">(i) has shown a pattern of repetitive behaviour, of which the 
  offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, that shows a likelihood 
  of the offender's causing death or injury to other persons or inflicting severe 
  psychological damage on other persons, or </p>
<p class="indent10">(ii) by conduct in any sexual matter including that involved 
  in the commission of the offence for which the offender has been convicted, 
  has shown a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons 
  in the future through similar offences.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Subject to subsections (3.1), (4) and (5), if the court 
  finds an offender to be a long-term offender, it shall</p>
<p class="indent">(a) impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender 
  has been convicted, which sentence must be a minimum punishment of imprisonment 
  for a term of two years; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) order the offender to be supervised in the community, for 
  a period not exceeding ten years, in accordance with section 753.2 and the Corrections 
  and Conditional Release Act. </p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(6) If the court does not find an offender to be a long-term 
  offender, the court shall impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender 
  has been convicted.</p>
<p>
  [17] Under s. 753.1(1)(a), a long-term offender designation can be considered 
  only if a sentence of two years or more would be appropriate for the offences 
  for which the offender has been convicted. If the offences warrant a sentence 
  of two years or more, the trial judge will then assess the risk of reoffending 
  and the possibility of control of that risk in the community: Criminal Code 
  s. 753.1(b), (c). The court must be satisfied that there is a substantial risk 
  that the offender will reoffend. It must find that the risk exists if the offender 
  has been convicted of one of the sexual offences set out in s. 753.1(2)(a) and 
  the offender meets the criteria in either s. 753.1(2)(b)(i) or s. 753.1(2)(b)(ii). 
  These criteria are similar to the dangerous offender criteria found in s. 753(1)(a)(i) 
  and s. 753(1)(b). </p>
<p>
  [18] If the court concludes that there is a substantial risk of reoffending, 
  it will then consider whether there is a reasonable possibility of controlling 
  that risk within the community. If that possibility exists, the offender may 
  be declared a long-term offender.</p>
<p>
  [19] An offender who is found to be a long-term offender is subject to community 
  supervision as described in s. 753.2. That section provides in part: </p>
<p class="indent"> 753.2(1) Subject to subsection (2), an offender who is required 
  to be supervised by an order made under paragraph 753.1(3)(b) shall be supervised 
  in accordance with the Corrections and Conditional Release Act &#133; .</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(3) An offender who is required to be supervised, a member of 
  the National Parole Board, or, on approval of that Board, the parole supervisor, 
  as that expression is defined in subsection 134.2(2) of the Corrections and 
  Conditional Release Act, of the offender, may apply to a superior court of criminal 
  jurisdiction for an order reducing the period of long-term supervision or terminating 
  it on the ground that the offender no longer presents a substantial risk of 
  reoffending and thereby being a danger to the community. The onus of proving 
  that ground is on the applicant. </p>
<p>
  [20] The Crown may bring a long-term offender application or it may seek that 
  designation by way of alternative remedy on a dangerous offender application: 
  Criminal Code s. 753(5).</p>
<p>
  [21] The operation of the provisions of Part XXIV of the Criminal Code and, 
  in particular, the interaction between the dangerous offender and long-term 
  offender provisions was recently considered in R. v. Johnson (2003), 177 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 97 (S.C.C.). The court held that where the Crown brings a dangerous offender 
  application, the trial judge must first determine whether the Crown has established 
  the dangerous offender criteria in either s. 753(1)(a) or s. 753(1)(b). If the 
  Crown has not established either set of criteria, the dangerous offender application 
  cannot succeed. If the Crown does establish that the offender fits into either 
  or both sets of criteria in s. 753(1), the sentencing judge is not obliged to 
  find that the offender is a dangerous offender but rather has a discretion as 
  to whether to declare the offender a dangerous offender: R. v. Johnson, supra, 
  at pp. 109-13. In exercising that discretion, the sentencing judge must take 
  into account the relevant principles of sentencing found in the Criminal Code 
  as they apply to dangerous offender applications. One of those principles requires 
  the sentencing judge to consider whether any available sanction short of an 
  indeterminate sentence would adequately protect the public. The court said at 
  p. 114: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The principles of sentencing thus dictate that a judge ought to impose an indeterminate 
  sentence only in those instances in which there does not exist less restrictive 
  means by which to protect the public adequately from the threat of harm, i.e., 
  where a definite sentence or a long-term offender designation are insufficient. 
  The essential question to be determined, then, is whether the sentencing sanctions 
  available pursuant to the long-term offender provisions are sufficient to reduce 
  this threat to an acceptable level, despite the fact that the statutory criteria 
  in s. 753(1) have been met [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [22] The court further described the circumstances in which the long-term offender 
  designation would be appropriate at pp. 114-15: </p>
<p class="indent"> Almost every offender who satisfies the dangerous offender 
  criteria will satisfy the first two criteria in the long-term offender provisions. 
  In virtually every instance in which an offender is declared dangerous, it would 
  be appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment of two or more years in 
  respect of the predicate offence and there will be a substantial risk that the 
  offender will reoffend. In a certain percentage of those cases there will also 
  be a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community. 
  In those instances in which the offender currently constitutes a threat to the 
  life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons yet there is 
  a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community, an 
  offender will satisfy the criteria in both the dangerous offender and long-term 
  offender provisions. </p>
<p class="indent">In those instances where both the dangerous and long-term offender 
  provisions are satisfied, it may be that the sentencing sanctions available 
  under the long-term offender provisions are capable of reducing the threat to 
  life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons to an acceptable 
  level. &#133; The very purpose of a long-term supervision order, then, is to 
  protect society from the threat that the offender currently poses - and to do 
  so without resort to the blunt instrument of indeterminate detention &#133; 
  . [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge did not have the benefit of the clear road map through 
  Part XXIV of the Code drawn in R. v. Johnson.</p>
<p>
  IV</p>
<p>
  The Evidence</p>
<p>
  [24] On the dangerous offender application, the trial judge had reports prepared 
  by Dr. Woodside and Dr. Bradford. Both psychiatrists also testified. Dr. Woodside 
  was the psychiatrist designated to prepare an assessment under s. 752.1 and 
  Dr. Bradford assessed the respondent at the request of the respondent's counsel. 
  Dr. Woodside assessed the respondent first. Dr. Bradford assessed the respondent 
  over an extended period while the respondent was hospitalized in Ottawa. In 
  addition to the psychiatric reports and testimony, the trial judge had voluminous 
  medical records pertaining to the respondent's long medical history.</p>
<p>
  [25] The respondent testified on the application. </p>
<p>
  [26] The respondent is a pedophile. He was born in 1975. He is an aboriginal 
  and was adopted when he was three months old and raised by a non-aboriginal 
  couple. The respondent left school after grade 12 and worked sporadically. He 
  described various consensual sexual activities with age appropriate males and 
  females. The respondent also described a strong interest in child pornography 
  and sexual activity with children. He reported having amassed thousands of pictures 
  of child pornography in his computer over a three-year period. The respondent 
  acknowledged that he had been involved in acts of fondling and oral sex with 
  approximately 20 children, the majority of whom had been males. According to 
  Dr. Woodside, the respondent insisted that the children had consented to the 
  sexual activity. The respondent was adamant that he would never do violence 
  to a child or use threats to force himself upon a child. He told Dr. Woodside 
  that he had never had intercourse with a child because he might harm the child.</p>
<p>
  [27] Dr. Woodside testified that the respondent was of average intelligence 
  and did not suffer from any neurological problems. Dr. Woodside opined that 
  the respondent likely suffered from a borderline personality disorder and major 
  depression. The tests conducted by Dr. Woodside indicated that the respondent 
  was a bisexual pedophile. This deviant sexual preference is a lifelong condition, 
  but can be treated by a combination of psychological and pharmacological approaches.</p>
<p>
  [28] The respondent had a long psychiatric history, including several attempts 
  at suicide. He had undergone various forms of treatment, none of which were 
  directed towards his pedophilia. The respondent had not complied with treatment 
  recommendations except in times of crisis.</p>
<p>
  [29] Based on his clinical assessment and actuarial assessments, Dr. Woodside 
  thought there was a "significant" chance that the respondent would 
  reoffend. Dr. Woodside believed that the respondent posed a "significant 
  risk for violent (sexual and non-sexual) reoffence". Dr. Woodside emphasized 
  that his main concern was the likelihood of sexual recidivism.</p>
<p>
  [30] Dr. Woodside did not think that the respondent was a good candidate for 
  treatment. He noted that the respondent needed lifelong treatment to help him 
  avoid situations in which he might be tempted to engage in sexual contact with 
  young children. Dr. Woodside did not think that the respondent appreciated the 
  negative effect that his conduct had on children, or the inability of children 
  to provide meaningful consent to sexual activities. The respondent had also 
  told Dr. Woodside that he would not take drugs to reduce his desire to have 
  sexual contact with children if those drugs reduced his overall sex drive. </p>
<p>
  [31] Dr. Woodside was very concerned that the respondent had insisted that he 
  would continue to use the Internet to access child pornography and would resist 
  any attempt to limit his Internet use. The respondent believed that viewing 
  child pornography on his computer helped him control his pedophilic urges. Dr. 
  Woodside testified that access to and the use of child pornography on the Internet 
  was not only harmful in and of itself, but also encouraged rather than diminished 
  resort to other pedophilic activity. </p>
<p>
  [32] Dr. Woodside testified that from a medical point of view, it was arguable 
  that the respondent met the dangerous offender criteria under s. 753(1)(a)(i) 
  and (ii). He further indicated that the respondent did meet the criteria in 
  s. 753(1)(b). Dr. Woodside was, however, careful to note that the ultimate question 
  whether a person met the relevant criteria was a legal rather than medical one.</p>
<p>
  [33] Dr. Woodside also testified that the respondent did not meet the long-term 
  offender criteria because he was not treatable in the community. Dr. Woodside 
  said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Mr. Hall was at high risk and is at high risk for sexual re-offence in a way 
  that I don't think treatment is going to markedly diminish.</p>
<p>
  [34] Dr. Bradford did not disagree with Dr. Woodside's psychiatric profile of 
  the respondent. He also agreed that there was a real risk that the respondent 
  would reoffend. He indicated, however, that reoffending could involve a wide 
  variety of sexual offences, some of which were less harmful than others. Dr. 
  Bradford observed that many features of the respondent's previous behaviour, 
  as well as his attitude towards sexual activity with children, suggested that 
  if the respondent were to reoffend, it would not involve the more egregious 
  forms of sexual conduct with children.</p>
<p>
  [35] Dr. Bradford acknowledged that pedophilia was a lifetime condition and 
  that pedophiles must learn to cope with that condition and avoid placing themselves 
  in situations where they could act in a sexually inappropriate way towards children. 
  Dr. Bradford indicated that pharmacological treatment was often helpful. He 
  testified that the vast majority of pedophiles are treated in the community 
  and are not held under indeterminate sentences as dangerous offenders. </p>
<p>
  [36] Dr. Bradford disagreed with Dr. Woodside's assessment of the respondent's 
  amenability to treatment in the community. He believed that the respondent could 
  be successfully treated in the community if he stopped accessing child pornography 
  on the internet and undertook behavioural and pharmacological treatment. Dr. 
  Bradford made this assessment knowing that the respondent had previously refused 
  treatment for psychiatric conditions other than pedophilia and that when he 
  had accepted treatment he had done so for brief periods of time during crisis 
  situations. Dr. Bradford also indicated that the respondent could only be successfully 
  treated if he acknowledged that he is a pedophile and was motivated to receive 
  the appropriate treatment. The respondent had acknowledged his pedophilia and 
  in Dr. Bradford's opinion was motivated to receive the necessary treatment.</p>
<p>
  [37] In his report, Dr. Bradford said: </p>

  Mr. Hall does not show the prolonged or persistent pattern of sexual offences 
  that I have normally seen in cases referred for a dangerous offender evaluation 
  or for a long-term offender evaluation. In my opinion, he would not qualify 
  for either of these designations. As I appreciate that this is a legal, as opposed 
  to a medical decision making process, if the decision is that he does fit the 
  criteria under s. 753(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, my opinion would be that there 
  is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community 
  i.e., he is treatable and therefore, in my opinion, meets the criteria under 
  section 753.1(1) as a long-term offender.</p>
<p>
  [38] Dr. Bradford was not specifically questioned about the above-quoted passage 
  from his report. The trial judge did, however, ask Dr. Bradford about the feasibility 
  of treatment as a term of probation and whether individuals continued treatment 
  after the probation period ended. Dr. Bradford replied: </p>
<p class="indent"> And again, my own sort of bias nonetheless, was that I felt 
  that short probation terms of three years, for example, in the case of sexual 
  offenders just didn't work as well as they should. And I was concerned that 
  people coming out on federal - out of the federal system, would be held to warrant 
  expiry and there would be nothing to monitor them and to deal with them in the 
  community , which I thought was - didn't make sense, particularly with sexual 
  offenders, and therefore, was very supportive of long-term offender legislation 
  with up to ten years of parole supervision.</p>
<p class="indent">I mean it's not just only the monitoring. If you look at most 
  of the studies, the recidivism tends to occur in the first five years. And it 
  occurs with time, but it slows down after the five years. So it would make sense 
  to have something that was in place for at least double the first five years 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [39] In his testimony, the respondent said that he had initially resisted taking 
  any medication that might reduce his sex drive, and had opposed any attempt 
  to limit his Internet use. While under the care of Dr. Bradford, he had come 
  to realize that he needed the medication and that accessing child pornography 
  on the Internet was not an effective way to control his pedophilic desires. 
  The respondent had taken the prescribed medication while at the Royal Ottawa 
  Hospital and had continued to take the medication after he was returned to the 
  local jail in Sault Ste. Marie.</p>
<p>
  [40] The respondent tried to explain his comments to Dr. Woodside concerning 
  young children consenting to sexual activity with him. The respondent said that 
  he was referring only to a specific young child and not to children in general. 
  </p>
<p>
  [41] After a thorough review of the evidence, the trial judge made strong unequivocal 
  findings of fact: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the final analysis, I accept the evidence of Dr. Bradford that the accused 
  can be treated so as to control his pedophilic urges. I find that since his 
  attendance at the Royal Ottawa Hospital the attitude of the accused in respect 
  to treatment has changed drastically and completely and that the change that 
  has occurred has been for the better, has been positive. While others may not 
  believe him, I do believe him when he says that he is committed to undergoing 
  treatment and to the continued use of the drugs required to be taken as a necessary 
  component of that treatment. He espouses the program of treatment, with the 
  pharmaceutical component included, even though he realizes that the ongoing 
  taking of the drugs may have serious side effects. At this time he is most definitely 
  not intractable, as are some pedophiles [emphasis added]. </p>

<p>
  The Alleged Error </p>
<p>
  [42] The Crown submits that the trial judge erred by requiring that the circumstances 
  surrounding the predicate offences relied on to support the dangerous offender 
  application pass a high seriousness threshold before they could support a dangerous 
  offender application. </p>
<p>
  [43] The trial judge began this part of his reasons by observing: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I come now to a consideration of what type of circumstances must or should exist 
  surrounding the commission of the predicate offences in order for a finding 
  to be made that the accused is either a dangerous or a long-term offender. Certainly, 
  for openers, the offences must be set out in the section of concern. That is 
  a given. In my view, however, more is required than just that simple fact. </p>
<p>
  [44] After reference to some authority, he said: </p>
<p class="indent"> In my view, the word serious as used by the court does not 
  only relate to the category of offence being considered. It surely must relate 
  as well to the facts surrounding the commission of the predicate offence/s relied 
  on by the Crown. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">The section of concern, in my respectful opinion, was never 
  intended to be used in cases where the conduct of the accused surrounding the 
  commission of the offence/s relied on by the Crown is anything but conduct approaching 
  the worst type of conduct imaginable and that the accused is among the worst 
  of offenders [emphasis in the original].</p>
<p>
  [45] The trial judge concluded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  none of the factual situations presented to the court, either standing alone, 
  or when considered in conjunction with each other, are of the serious type required 
  to permit or require this court to make the findings sought by the Crown [emphasis 
  in the original].</p>
<p>
  [46] I agree with Crown counsel's submission that the trial judge's approach 
  to the dangerous offender provisions is inconsistent with the analysis provided 
  in R. v. Currie (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 205 (S.C.C.). In Currie, the Crown brought 
  a dangerous offender application under s. 753(b) [now s. 753(1)(b)]. Currie 
  had been convicted of three charges of sexual assault all of which arose out 
  of the groping of young girls in a department store. The facts surrounding these 
  convictions were significantly less serious than the facts surrounding Currie's 
  earlier convictions for sexual assault. This court reversed the trial judge's 
  dangerous offender finding in part because the trial judge had failed to consider 
  whether the facts surrounding the convictions for sexual assault were sufficiently 
  serious to support a dangerous offender application ((1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 
  281).</p>
<p>
  [47] The Supreme Court of Canada restored the trial judge's finding. Lamer C.J.C., 
  for the court, rejected the contention that a dangerous offender finding could 
  be made only where the facts surrounding the commission of the offence triggering 
  the application were sufficiently serious. He said at p. 214: </p>
<p class="indent">
  once an individual has committed an offence specifically defined in the Criminal 
  Code as a "serious personal injury offence", he or she has made it 
  possible for the Crown to invoke the Criminal Code's dangerous offender application 
  process. If that process is invoked, it is incumbent upon the trial judge to 
  evaluate the offender's potential danger to the public and this may or may not 
  depend upon the specific nature and objective gravity of the predicate offence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [48] Lamer C.J.C. explained at pp. 215-16 that s. 753(1)(b) involved a two-step 
  process. First, the Crown had to establish a conviction for a "serious 
  personal injury offence". In the light of the definition in s. 752(b), 
  a conviction for sexual assault is a conviction for a "serious personal 
  injury offence" without any inquiry into the nature or circumstances of 
  that offence. Once the Crown had shown that the offender had been convicted 
  of a "serious personal injury offence", the inquiry then turned to 
  the dangerousness of the offender and the likelihood of the commission of further 
  offences having any of the effects described in s. 753(b). This second inquiry 
  looked to the offender's "conduct in any sexual matter including that involved 
  in the commission of the offence". At this stage, the circumstances surrounding 
  the conviction for the predicate offence became relevant as did his past behaviour. 
  In rejecting the contention that the facts surrounding the predicate offence 
  must pass a seriousness threshold, the Chief Justice explained at pp. 216-17: </p>
<p class="indent"> Section 753(b) might not make sense if, for example, it were 
  to provide, without qualification, that a trial judge may designate any person 
  who commits a "serious personal injury offence" as a dangerous offender. But, 
  it is crucial to recognize that the conviction for a "serious personal injury 
  offence" merely triggers the s. 753(b) application process. There remains a 
  second stage to s. 753(b), at which point the trial judge must be satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt of the likelihood of future danger that an offender 
  presents to society before he or she can impose the dangerous offender designation 
  and an indeterminate sentence. </p>
<p class="indent">Parliament has thus created a standard of preventive detention 
  that measures an accused's present condition according to past behaviour and 
  patterns of conduct. Under this statutory arrangement, dangerous offenders who 
  have committed "serious personal injury offences" can be properly sentenced 
  without having to wait for them to strike out in a particularly egregious way 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [49] The respondent was convicted of sexual assault.<a href="#a">[4]</a><a name="4"></a> 
  Under s. 753(1)(b), sexual assault is a "serious personal injury offence". There 
  is no requirement that the facts surrounding the sexual assault clear any seriousness 
  threshold. The trial judge erred in law by effectively holding that some sexual 
  assaults were not sufficiently serious to engage s. 753(1)(b). Rather than fixing 
  on the seriousness of the circumstances surrounding the offence which triggered 
  the application, the trial judge should have focused on whether the totality 
  of the respondent's conduct in sexual matters showed a failure to control his 
  sexual impulses and a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to other 
  persons. </p>
<p>
  [50] The extracts from the trial judge's reasons quoted above also make it clear 
  that he interpreted the long-term offender provisions as applicable only where 
  the circumstances surrounding the offence giving rise to the application were 
  so serious as to approach the worst offender/worst offence category. This limitation 
  is not found in s. 753.1. The seriousness of the offences giving rise to the 
  application is addressed in s. 753.1(1)(a). If the offence or offences for which 
  the offender was convicted merit a sentence of two years or more, they are sufficiently 
  serious to trigger the further inquiry into the risk posed by the offender and 
  the possibility of controlling that risk within the community.</p>
<p>
  [51] The trial judge erred in law in limiting the application of the dangerous 
  offender and long-term offender provisions to situations in which the circumstances 
  surrounding the sexual assault giving rise to the application were sufficiently 
  serious to warrant a dangerous offender designation. He should have followed 
  the analysis set out in R. v. Currie.</p>
<p>
  VI</p>
<p>
  The Appropriate Order</p>
<p>
  [52] The Crown has established an error in law. Section 759(4) reads: </p>
<p class="indent"> 759(4) On an appeal against the dismissal of an application 
  for an order that an offender is a dangerous offender under this Part, the court 
  of appeal may</p>
<p class="indent">(a) allow the appeal and</p>
<p class="indent10">(i) find that the offender is a dangerous offender,</p>
<p class="indent10">(ii) find that the offender is not a dangerous offender, find 
  that the offender is a long-term offender, impose a minimum sentence of imprisonment 
  for two years, for the offence for which the offender has been convicted, and 
  order the offender to be supervised in the community, for a period that does 
  not, subject to subsection 743.1(5), exceed ten years, in accordance with section 
  753.2 and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, or </p>
<p class="indent10"><span class="indent10">(iii) order a new hearing; or</span></p>
<p class="indent">(b) dismiss the appeal [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [53] In exercising its remedial power, this court will accept findings of fact 
  made by the trial judge if those findings are not tainted by the legal error: 
  R. v. Dow (1999), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 323 at 340 (B.C.C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [54] The trial judge made two important findings of fact. Neither is tainted 
  by his erroneous interpretation of the legislation. First, he found that there 
  was a risk that the respondent would commit further sexual offences. He did 
  not attempt to quantify the risk. The psychiatric evidence and the respondent's 
  long history of sexual offences against children left no doubt that he posed 
  a risk of reoffending. Even if that risk were to manifest itself in the less 
  egregious forms of sexual misconduct against children, that conduct would likely 
  cause "injury, pain or other evil" to the victims and would constitute 
  one of the offences set out in s. 753.1(2)(a). Consequently, it would meet the 
  statutory requirements for a finding that there was a substantial risk that 
  the respondent would reoffend: see Criminal Code s. 753.1(2)(a) and s. 753.1(2)(b)(ii). 
  Second, the trial judge found, based on the evidence of Dr. Bradford and the 
  respondent, that there was at least a reasonable possibility that the respondent's 
  risk of reoffending could be controlled within the community. </p>
<p>
  [55] Applying the approach described in Johnson, supra, to these findings of 
  fact, a long-term offender designation is the proper result. I note that although 
  Dr. Bradford did not support this designation in his report, his evidence summarized 
  above (supra, para. 38) seems to recognize the value and need for long-term 
  community supervision of the respondent. </p>
<p>
  [56] Although the evidence warrants a long-term offender designation, there 
  are two possible legal impediments to a long-term offender designation. Neither 
  impediment was relied on by the respondent, although the possible effect of 
  s. 11(i) of the Charter was raised briefly in oral argument.</p>
<p>
  [57] Section 11(i) of the Charter requires that where there is a change in penalty 
  between the date of the commission of the offence and the imposition of sentence, 
  the offender must receive the benefit of the lesser penalty. A long-term offender 
  designation is a form of punishment for the purposes of s. 11(i) of the Charter. 
  Consequently, the designation cannot be invoked where the convictions giving 
  rise to that designation arose out of offences that occurred before August 1, 
  1997, unless in the circumstances the long-term offender designation is a lesser 
  punishment than the punishment that the offender would have received prior to 
  the enactment of the long-term offender provisions. As observed in Johnson, 
  supra, pp. 118-19, if the offender would have been declared a dangerous offender 
  but for the availability of the long-term offender provisions, those provisions 
  provide for a lesser punishment and can be invoked in respect of offences that 
  occurred before the enactment of the long-term offender legislation.</p>
<p>
  [58] The constitutional prohibition against the retroactive application of increased 
  penalties does not stand in the way of a long-term offender designation in the 
  circumstances of this case. While it is true that the sexual assault conviction 
  relied on by the Crown for the purposes of the dangerous offender application 
  may have occurred before August 1, 1997, the Crown did not have to rely on that 
  conviction to trigger the potential application of the long-term offender provisions. 
  Section 753.1(1)(a) directs that the long-term offender provisions are available 
  only where a sentence of two years or more would be appropriate "for the 
  offence for which the offender has been convicted". In my view, if a sentence 
  totalling two years or more would have been appropriate for the offences the 
  respondent committed after August 1, 1997, the application of the long-term 
  offender provisions to the respondent does not amount to the retroactive application 
  of the long-term offender legislation. </p>
<p>
  [59] Of the 43 charges to which the respondent pled guilty, most occurred after 
  August 1, 1997. These included seven counts of invitation to sexual touching 
  contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. Considering the totality of the respondent's 
  post-August 1, 1997 conduct, I have no hesitation in holding that this conduct 
  merited a sentence of at least two years.</p>
<p>
  [60] The second potential impediment to the imposition of a long-term offender 
  designation arises out of the requirement that the designation include a sentence 
  of imprisonment of at least two years. Section 753.1(3)(a) requires that the 
  court: </p>
<p class="indent">
  impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender has been convicted, 
  which sentence must be a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of two 
  years.</p>
<p>
  [61] The respondent was in custody for almost 30 months prior to sentencing. 
  Following the usual practice, the trial judge gave the respondent two for one 
  credit for his pre-sentence custody. On this basis, the respondent had served 
  the equivalent of four years and ten months. The trial judge concluded that 
  no additional period of incarceration was necessary. </p>
<p>
  [62] I accept that given the long period of pre-sentence custody, it would not 
  have been appropriate to impose a further period of incarceration in excess 
  of two years. This does not, however, mean that a long-term offender designation 
  could not have been made. Pre-trial incarceration may be taken into account 
  where a statute imposes a minimum penalty: R. v. Wust (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 
  129 (S.C.C.); R. v. McDonald (1998), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 57 (Ont. C.A.). The same 
  reasoning applies to the requirement in the long-term offender provisions that 
  the court impose a sentence of at least two years. Having regard to pre-sentence 
  incarceration in calculating the length of the sentence imposed for the purposes 
  of the long-term offender provisions upholds Parliament's intention that the 
  long-term offender status should be available only for persons who commit offences 
  that warrant sentences of two years or more, and at the same time preserves 
  the court's discretion under s. 719(3) of the Criminal Code to take into account 
  pre-sentence incarceration: R. v. Wust, supra, at p. 136. If the sentence imposed 
  by a trial judge, having regard to the credit that the trial judge gives for 
  pre-sentence incarceration, is the equivalent of a sentence of two years or 
  more, the first pre-condition to the finding that an offender is a long-term 
  offender is met. </p>
<p>
  VII</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [63] Having regard to the findings of fact made by the trial judge and the undisputed 
  evidence detailing the respondent's psychiatric condition and history of sexual 
  misconduct, I am satisfied that a finding that the respondent was a long-term 
  offender was the only reasonable conclusion available on the totality of the 
  record. </p>
<p>
  [64] Under the long-term offender provisions, the community supervision order 
  can run for up to 10 years. The respondent has been under strict terms of probation 
  for almost two years. I would allow the appeal, vary the sentence on all counts 
  (save those where the respondent was a young offender) to one of time served, 
  which I would equate to a sentence of four years and ten months. In addition, 
  I would make an order directing that the respondent be supervised in the community 
  in accordance with s. 753.2 for a period of eight years. I note that, if appropriate, 
  the respondent can apply at a future date to have the supervisory period terminated 
  or reduced: Criminal Code s. 753.2(3). </p>

  and September 1997 and encompassed several assaults on J.L. The latest version 
  of the dangerous offender provisions came into force on August 1, 1997. The 
  facts relied on to support the guilty plea on the sexual assault charge did 
  not indicate whether any part of the sexual activity relied on to support the 
  conviction occurred after August 1, 1997. Even if all of the activity occurred 
  before August 1, 1997, the Crown could rely on the sexual assault conviction 
  to bring its dangerous offender application. The definition of dangerous offender 
  was not altered by the amendment. Had the trial judge found the respondent to 
  be a dangerous offender, the question of whether the sexual assault had occurred 
  entirely before August 1, 1997 would have become significant since the current 
  dangerous offender provisions are more severe in some ways than the predecessor 
  provisions. If a dangerous offender finding was based on conduct which occurred 
  before August 1, 1997, the offender could not be subjected to harsher treatment 
  under the amended provisions.</p>
