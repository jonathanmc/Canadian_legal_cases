<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The trial judge gave extensive and thoughtful reasons. He referred to all 
  the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors and the relevant objectives 
  of sentence. He gave careful consideration to the defence submission for a conditional 
  sentence. He was aware that a conditional sentence is possible for some sexual 
  offences but in his view, this offence was so serious that the objectives of 
  deterrence and denunciation would not be met by a conditional sentence. </p>
<p>[2] We see no error in principle in the trial judge's approach and the sentence 
  is not manifestly excessive. On the trial judge's findings, this was forceful 
  sexual intercourse on a thirteen-year-old girl. The offence was accompanied 
  by some violence and threats and there was some threatening conduct afterwards. 
  The impact on the complainant was profound.</p>
<p>[3] In view of this court's limited right to review trial decisions on sentence, 
  we cannot interfere, notwithstanding the very many positive features in the 
  appellant's background and the significant contributions he has made to support 
  his family, including his disabled mother. No doubt, these many positive features 
  will be taken into account by the parole board at the first possible opportunity. 
</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
