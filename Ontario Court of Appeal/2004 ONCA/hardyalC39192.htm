<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This appeal must be allowed. Evidence of a highly prejudicial nature in 
  the form of a tip from a confidential informant was placed before the jury. 
  While that evidence was admissible to show the state of mind of the officers, 
  given the nature of the defence, it was not admissible for its truth. The trial 
  judge was required to give the jury a limiting instruction on the use to be 
  made of that evidence. </p>
<p>[2] Notwithstanding the lack of objection by defence counsel, this is not a 
  proper case to apply the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. 
  Crown counsel cross-examined the appellant on this evidence and referred to 
  it in her closing address for the purpose of having the jury use the information 
  for its truth. As well, in the charge to the jury, the trial judge referred 
  to this evidence as part of the evidence relied upon by the Crown. </p>
<p>[3] Without a limiting instruction about the hearsay use of the evidence, the 
  jury would believe that they were entitled to use the contents of the informer's 
  tip for its truth to support the evidence of the police officers. The limiting 
  instruction on the use of the appellant's criminal record was not sufficient 
  to remove the possibility that the jury would misuse this evidence for its truth. 
  <br>
  [4] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial 
  ordered.</p>
