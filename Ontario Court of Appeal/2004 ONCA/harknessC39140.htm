<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of stolen property 
  valued at less than $5,000. The property consisted of certain stickers, which 
  were taken from the appellant&#146;s employer&#146;s place of business. The 
  plea was the result of joint discussions between the Crown and counsel for the 
  appellant.</p>
<p>[2] On appeal, counsel argues that the plea was not unequivocal. He contends 
  that in the course of submissions on sentence, counsel for the appellant took 
  the position that the appellant had an honest belief that he was entitled to 
  take the stickers from his employer and therefore, that the stickers were not 
  stolen. Counsel contends that the trial judge should have struck the plea once 
  counsel advanced the submission. He contends that we should do so now.</p>
<p>[3] We have reviewed the transcript. In our view, the plea was not equivocal. 
  The facts read in by the Crown fully supported the plea. The explanation offered 
  by appellant&#146;s counsel in mitigation amounted to the assertion that it 
  was common practice for employees, even supervisors, to take stickers from the 
  employer and that in light of this common practice, the appellant believed that 
  it was acceptable for him to do so. This does not amount to a defence in law.</p>
<p>[4] The trial judge specifically asked counsel in the course of the submissions 
  whether she was suggesting that the appellant had permission from the employer 
  to take the stickers. Counsel made it clear that no such suggestion was being 
  advanced on behalf of the appellant.</p>
<p>[5] The plea was entered with the full advantage of the assistance of counsel.</p>
<p>[6] There is an onus on the appellant in this court to demonstrate that the 
  plea was equivocal. Some of the comments in the transcript made by counsel in 
  the course of the submissions may be considered ambiguous. However, considering 
  the transcript in its entirety, we are not persuaded that the plea was equivocal 
  in the manner alleged by the appellant. In coming to this conclusion, we note 
  that no attempt was made in this court to file an affidavit from either the 
  appellant or trial counsel to address the alleged &#147;defence&#148; counsel 
  contends was put forward in the course of submissions on sentence.</p>
<p>[7] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
