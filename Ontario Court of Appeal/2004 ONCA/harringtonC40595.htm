<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Alfred J. Stong of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated August 11, 2003 dismissing an application for certiorari.</p>
<p>
  SHARPE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal from the order of Stong J. dismissing the appellant's 
  certiorari application challenging the appellant's committal for trial on five 
  charges including attempted murder.</p>
<p>
  [2] At the conclusion of the Crown's evidence at the preliminary inquiry, the 
  preliminary inquiry judge invited Crown counsel to make submissions with respect 
  to the issue of committal on one count as it related to the appellant's co-accused. 
  She then added: </p>
<p class="indent">
  That is the only issue on which I wish to hear submissions, period.</p>
<p>
  [3] Neither defence counsel made any comment in response to this direction nor 
  did defence counsel make any submissions with respect to the committal.</p>
<p>
  [4] The application judge found that defence counsel had been denied the opportunity 
  to make submissions: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am satisfied on the basis of [the statement of the preliminary inquiry judge] 
  that counsel could make no other determination than that the learned trial judge 
  did not wish to hear submissions other than on the issue designated by her at 
  the time and that counsel was effectively prohibited from making submissions. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] However, the application judge went on to conclude that the appellant had 
  suffered no prejudice as there clearly was evidence sufficient to warrant committal 
  for trial. He therefore dismissed the application for certiorari.</p>
<p> [6] I agree with the appellant and with the application judge that the preliminary 
  inquiry judge refused to entertain submissions from the defence in relation 
  to the committal and that her error constituted a denial of natural justice. 
  The issue is whether that error was curable, and if it was, whether the appellant 
  suffered any prejudice. Section 686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code provides 
  that an appellate court may dismiss an appeal where notwithstanding any procedural 
  irregularity at trial, the trial court had jurisdiction over the class of offence 
  of which the appellant was convicted and the court of appeal is of the opinion 
  that the appellant suffered no prejudice thereby.</p>
<p>
  [7] By virtue of s. 784(2) of the Criminal Code, s. 686 applies to appeals from 
  a dismissal of an application for extraordinary remedy such as certiorari: see 
  R. v. Olson (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 491 (S.C.C.) at 494.</p>
<p>
  [8] In my view, the error of the preliminary inquiry judge in this case is subject 
  to the curative provision of s. 686(1)(b)(iv). </p>
<p>
  [9] As explained by Goodman J.A. in R. v. Cloutier (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 35 
  (Ont. C.A.), s. 686(1)(b)(iv) was introduced in 1985 to overcome the problem 
  created by procedural errors considered to be jurisdictional in nature and not 
  curable by the general proviso which deals with errors of law. Goodman J.A., 
  at 48, rejected the submission that s. 686(1)(b)(iv) cannot cure "irregularities 
  in procedure which are so serious in nature that they are deemed to be matters 
  of substance which result in a loss of jurisdiction". As he further explained 
  at 48: "Although [this] type of error or irregularity is one that is so 
  serious that it is deemed to be fundamental in nature and results in a loss 
  of jurisdiction, it does nevertheless have its origin as a procedural irregularity 
  at trial." In making this conclusion, Goodman J.A. adopted the following 
  passage from R. v. Joinson (1986), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 542 (B.C.C.A.) at 547-48: </p>
<p class="indent"> The appellant submits that s. 613(1)(b)(iv) ought not to be 
  construed as applying to errors of substance.</p>
<p class="indent">It is necessary then to define the difference between matters 
  of substantive law and those involving criminal procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">Substantive criminal law is concerned with the creation of offences 
  (including a definition of the elements necessary to constitute an offence in 
  criminal law), the recognition of defences, including exemptions, justifications 
  and excuses.</p>
<p class="indent">Criminal procedure is concerned with the conduct of a criminal 
  trial, as well as with pre-trial and post-trial procedures.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Many of the procedural provisions of the Criminal Code are designed 
  to protect the right of an accused to a fair trial. Taking a plea, putting an 
  accused to his election, the presence of an accused at his trial, are all matters 
  which are mandatory but which are procedural, in the natural sense of that word. 
  They all involve a manner of proceeding with the trial of an accused. They all 
  have to do with the conduct or mode of conducting a trial. An accused has the 
  right to have the statutory procedure applied, but it is still procedure which 
  is being applied. &#133; If the error can be remedied without prejudice to the 
  accused then Parliament has said that the case may be determined as if no error 
  had occurred.</p>
<p>
  [10] In R. v. Khan (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at para. 16, Arbour J. 
  adopted the analysis in Cloutier: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I agree with Goodman J.A. in Cloutier that s. 686(1)(b)(iv) was enacted to cure 
  serious procedural irregularities, otherwise amounting to errors of law, in 
  cases where under the then existing case law, jurisdiction over the person, 
  but not over the offence, had been lost.</p>
<p>
  [11] Though unquestionably serious in nature, the denial of natural justice 
  in this case originated from a "procedural irregularity" and not from 
  an error of substantive law. Therefore, if the appellant suffered no prejudice 
  by virtue of the error, it is curable under s. 686(1)(b)(iv). </p>
<p>
  [12] I agree with the application judge that the appellant suffered no prejudice 
  by reason of the procedural irregularity. The appellant focused his attack on 
  the committal on attempted murder. He submitted that the preliminary inquiry 
  judge misconstrued the evidence because the judge proceeded on the basis that 
  there was evidence the appellant's threat to put a bullet into the victim's 
  head was made before the shooting whereas the evidence was that this threat 
  was uttered afterwards. The appellant submitted that but for that erroneous 
  assumption, the preliminary inquiry judge would have found an absence of evidence 
  of intent to support the committal for attempted murder. I disagree with that 
  submission and agree with the application judge that quite apart from this apparent 
  misapprehension as to the evidence, committal on the charge of attempted murder 
  was inevitable on the evidence led by the Crown. At the preliminary inquiry, 
  the Crown led evidence to suggest that the appellant held a gun to the head 
  of the victim and then shot him in the side through the rib cage after a struggle 
  between the victim and the co-accused. Given this evidence, there was no error 
  in committing the appellant to trial for attempted murder.</p>
<p>
  [13] I conclude, accordingly, the while there was an error going to jurisdiction, 
  the application judge properly dismissed the application for certiorari. Accordingly, 
  I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
