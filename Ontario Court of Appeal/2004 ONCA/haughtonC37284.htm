<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Susanne R. Goodman of the 
  Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on February 22, 2001 and from 
  the sentence imposed by Justice Goodman on April 17, 2001.</p>
<p>
  CHARRON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] A Subway restaurant owner was robbed at gunpoint in broad daylight as he 
  was walking to the bank to make a deposit. The gunman fled by car with his associate. 
  Two employees from an adjacent Arby's restaurant witnessed the robbery, immediately 
  called 9?1?1 and gave the licence number of the car. They had jotted the licence 
  number down earlier that morning because the actions of the two men had seemed 
  "strange" and "suspicious" to them. Within minutes, the 
  car was stopped by the police. Just as the driver was ordered to come out of 
  the vehicle, the right rear passenger door swung open and the appellant, Michael 
  Washington Haughton, came out and fled to a nearby field. Several fences and 
  rooftops further, he was apprehended and found in possession of an empty holster 
  and a packet of money with a deposit slip wrapped around it. A later search 
  of the vehicle revealed, among other things, a .40 calibre pistol, ammunition, 
  a cell phone, clothing (including a floppy hat), and another bundle of money 
  with a Subway deposit slip around it.</p>
<p>
  [2] Haughton identified himself under a false name. Once the police established 
  who he was, he apologized for lying, explaining that he was "mad because 
  [his] leg hurt." When asked about what happened he stated: "We were 
  just keeping six in the back. The people saw us. The other guys did it and then 
  threw the stuff in our car and we went separate ways." He denied being 
  the principal in the crime and any knowledge of the use of a gun. </p>
<p>
  [3] One of the Arby's employees made a positive identification in a photo line-up 
  of the appellant as the robber and of his co-accused as the other person in 
  the car. The other Arby's employee gave a description of the two suspects. Neither 
  observed more than two perpetrators. A surveillance videotape taken from inside 
  the Subway store depicted a man in a floppy hat using a cell phone shortly after 
  10:00 a.m. on the day of the robbery. Records for the cell phone found in the 
  car revealed that it was the appellant's phone and that it had been used at 
  10:20 a.m. on the date of the robbery. </p>
<p>
  [4] Haughton was tried with his co-accused before a judge and a jury. At the 
  commencement of his trial, he pleaded guilty to possession of stolen property 
  in relation to the items seized upon his arrest and to obstructing justice in 
  relation to the false identification he had given to the police. He contested 
  the remaining robbery and weapons charges. Neither accused testified. After 
  a two and a half week trial, Haughton was found guilty on all the contested 
  charges, except for one in respect of which there was a directed verdict of 
  acquittal. He was sentenced to a total of 5 years and 6 months in addition to 
  21 and a half months spent in pre-trial custody. </p>
<p>
  [5] Haughton appeals against conviction and sentence. He pleads the following 
  errors in his appeal against conviction: </p>
<p class="indent"> i) The trial judge failed to instruct the jury in terms set 
  out in R. v. Nikolovski, infra, on the manner in which they were to assess the 
  surveillance video.</p>
<p class="indent">ii) The trial judge erred by permitting an investigating officer 
  to report an eyewitness's remarks at a photo line-up procedure during which 
  she was unable to identify the appellant. It is submitted that this error was 
  exacerbated by Crown counsel's reliance on this evidence in closing submissions 
  and the trial judge's failure to instruct the jury that one witness's failure 
  to identify the accused may detract from the trustworthiness of another's witness's 
  identification. </p>
<p class="indent">iii) The trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that 
  the evidence of the appellant's after-the-fact flight from the police had no 
  probative value given his guilty plea to possession of stolen property. Alternatively, 
  at a minimum, the trial judge ought to have instructed the jury that there may 
  be an alternative explanation for this conduct. </p>
<p class="indent">iv) The trial judge failed to explain adequately how a reasonable 
  doubt could arise from an absence of evidence. It is submitted that this non-direction 
  was a serious misdirection as the appellant relied upon the failure of the police 
  to perform certain investigations and forensic testing to raise a reasonable 
  doubt. It is further submitted that the error was exacerbated by the fact that 
  the Crown was permitted to question the investigating officer on whether the 
  defence had requested any testing of items in police custody.</p>
<p>
  [6] No objection was made at trial in respect of any of these alleged errors. 
  Counsel for the appellant asserts that the failure of trial counsel to object 
  should not be a bar to the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [7] Haughton also seeks leave to appeal his sentence. </p>
<p>
  [8] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal against both conviction 
  and sentence. </p>
<p>
  (1) Instructions with Respect to the Surveillance Video</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant contends that the trial judge should have instructed the jury 
  with regard to the terms set out in R. v. Nikolovski (1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 
  403 (S.C.C.): </p>
<p class="indent">
  Although triers of fact are entitled to reach a conclusion as to identification 
  based solely on videotape evidence, they must exercise care in doing so. For 
  example, when a jury is asked to identify an accused in this manner, it is essential 
  that clear directions be given to them as to how they are to approach this task. 
  They should be instructed to consider carefully whether the video is of sufficient 
  clarity and quality and shows the accused for a sufficient time to enable them 
  to conclude that identification has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. If 
  it is the only evidence adduced as to identity, the jury should be reminded 
  of this. Further, they should be told once again of the importance that, in 
  order to convict on the basis of the videotape alone, they must be satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that it identifies the accused.</p>
<p>
  [10] The principle set out in Nikolovski has no application to this case. There 
  was no suggestion that the identification of the appellant was based solely 
  on the videotape evidence. Indeed, the appellant did not contest that he was 
  at the scene at the relevant time. The videotape was simply one link in a chain 
  of events relied upon by the Crown to prove that the accused was not only at 
  the scene as a lookout, as he had maintained in his statement to the police, 
  but was an active participant in the robbery. In the circumstances of this case, 
  an instruction in the terms set out in Nikolovski may well have misled the jury 
  to consider the videotape in isolation and to apply the standard of proof beyond 
  a reasonable doubt to individual items as opposed to the whole of the evidence. 
  </p>
<p>
  (2) Prior Statement of an Identification Witness</p>
<p>
  [11] As stated earlier, two Arby's employees witnessed the robbery. Robyn Hillis 
  identified the appellant and his co-accused both in the photo line-up and at 
  trial. Marilyn Burke was able to identify the co-accused at the line-up and 
  at trial, but not the appellant. In reference to Haughton's photo in the line-up, 
  she commented during the line-up procedure: "That's pretty damn close. 
  I can't remember if he had any facial hair. He is the closest so far." 
  When asked at trial whether she would recognize the person she described as 
  the robber, she responded: "I probably wouldn't be able to. I didn't see 
  very much facial features." </p>
<p>
  [12] This ground of appeal relates to Ms. Burke's out-of-court statement about 
  Haughton's photograph at the photo line-up. Crown counsel did not elicit this 
  evidence from Ms. Burke during her examination-in-chief. Ms. Burke was questioned 
  about the line-up procedure and the statements that she made at the time, but 
  only in respect of the co-accused. In cross-examination, defence counsel elicited 
  from Ms. Burke the simple fact that she had not been able to identify the robber 
  at the photo line-up without putting to her the exact words she had said. Ms. 
  Burke was not re-examined on this point. At a later point in the trial, the 
  investigating officer was examined by the Crown about the entire line-up procedure. 
  It is in the course of that testimony that the remarks made by Ms. Burke in 
  respect of Haughton's photograph were introduced in evidence. </p>
<p>
  [13] The appellant argues that Ms. Burke's out-of-court statement of identification 
  was inadmissible hearsay. He submits that its admission was prejudicial because 
  Crown counsel, in its closing address to the jury, relied on this evidence to 
  bolster the identification made by the other eyewitness, Ms. Hillis. Crown counsel 
  stated the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There are two eyewitnesses that place both Mr. Haughton and Mr. Sposato at the 
  scene. In fact, in the police statements that they gave, they both admit that 
  they were actually there. So that much is not seriously in issue. The eyewitnesses 
  at Arby's describe the suspicious movements and both actually see the robbery. 
  One of the ladies, Ms Hillis, says positively that the robber was Mr. Haughton. 
  She picks him out of a photo lineup. The other, Ms Burke, doesn't positively 
  identify Mr. Haughton but it's not like she doesn't recognize his photograph. 
  You will recall what Detective Pinkney said about the lineup process with her. 
  It's not that she doesn't recognize anyone. She picks out Mr. Haughton's photograph 
  and recognizes it but she's unable to distinguish it from two other photographs. 
  So, there isn't a positive I.D. but there is some recognition there.</p>
<p>
  [14] The following succinct statement on the law respecting prior statements 
  of identification is sufficient for our purposes. In R. v. Starr (2000), 147 
  C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), Iacobucci J., in writing for the majority, stated 
  the following (at para. 221): </p>
<p class="indent">
  The scope of the "prior identification" exception to the hearsay rule 
  was recently thoroughly canvassed in the lucid reasons of Doherty J.A. in Tat, 
  supra. As Doherty J.A. sets out, there are two situations in which out-of-court 
  statements of identification may be admitted for the truth of their contents. 
  First, "prior statements identifying or describing the accused are admissible 
  where the identifying witness identifies the accused at trial" (pp. 497-98). 
  Second, such statements are admissible "where the identifying witness is 
  unable to identify the accused at trial, but can testify that he or she previously 
  gave an accurate description or made an accurate identification" (p. 500). 
  In the latter circumstance, Doherty J.A. explained, "the identifying witness 
  may testify to what he or she said or did on those earlier occasions and those 
  who heard the description given by the witness or witnessed the identification 
  made by the witness may give evidence of what the witness said or did" 
  (ibid.). </p>
<p>
  [15] It is important to note that the "prior identification" exception 
  is not restricted to prior statements of positive identification; it extends 
  to prior descriptions provided by a witness. It therefore follows from the second 
  branch of the exception that Ms. Burke's statement about Haughton's photograph 
  in the line-up was admissible so long as she confirmed its accuracy. Had she 
  done so, the statement would simply have formed part of her overall description 
  of the robber. The difficulty here is that, although Ms. Burke confirmed her 
  prior statement of identification at the line-up with respect to the co-accused, 
  she was not asked to do so with respect to Haughton. Hence, strictly speaking, 
  the appellant is correct in saying that Ms. Burke's prior statement of identification 
  was inadmissible hearsay in the form that it was presented - that is, solely 
  from the mouth of the investigating officer. </p>
<p>
  [16] However, in the circumstances of this case, there was no harm done. No 
  objection was made to the investigating officer's testimony on this point. There 
  was no suggestion made during the trial that this or any other witness's statement 
  at the line-up procedure was recorded inaccurately. The evidence could have 
  been elicited from Ms. Burke in examination-in-chief, or, in light of the cross-examination 
  on this point, in re? examination. Finally, the trial judge gave extensive and 
  exemplary instructions on the manner in which the jury should consider the identification 
  evidence. </p>
<p>
  [17] On this latter point, I would note that the appellant's submission on the 
  effect of this court's decision in R. v. Spatola (1970), 4 C.C.C. 241 (Ont. 
  C.A.), [1970] 3 O.R. 74 is misguided. Counsel for the appellant submits that 
  as a result of Spatola, the trial judge was obligated to specifically instruct 
  the jury that the fact that one eyewitness could not identify the accused may 
  detract from the second witness's identification. Spatola does not establish 
  any such rule. The majority of the court made it mandatory to give general instructions 
  to the jury on the frailties of identification evidence in certain circumstances. 
  Two such circumstances were identified: "where the identification evidence 
  is offset either by evidence of a contrary nature or by evidence of a failure 
  or inability of another witness equally in a position to see the alleged offender, 
  to make an identification." In dissent, Justice Aylesworth expressed the 
  view that there was no legal requirement that the jury be charged with regard 
  to the inherent frailty of identification evidence; the matter was entirely 
  discretionary. The second circumstance identified by the majority simply triggered 
  the obligation to caution the jury about the frailties of this kind of evidence. 
  The court did not establish a firm rule, as contended by the appellant, on what 
  specific instructions must be given to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [18] The law has evolved considerably since Spatola was decided in 1970. It 
  is now well-established that in all cases where identification is in issue and 
  is dependent upon eyewitness identification, the jury should be warned about 
  the frailties of such evidence. As noted earlier, the jury in this case was 
  so instructed in an exemplary fashion. As well, the jury was specifically instructed 
  on the discrepancies between the two eyewitnesses' testimony and was reminded 
  that one witness could not identify the accused. </p>
<p>
  [19] For these reasons, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (3) The Post-Offence Conduct</p>
<p>
  [20] The appellant notes that at one point in his closing submissions, Crown 
  counsel stated: "I also ask you to consider why [Haughton] flees the police." 
  He submits that since the Crown relied on the evidence of flight, the judge 
  ought to have alerted the jury to the fact that the flight may have been due 
  to Haughton's possession of stolen property - a charge to which he admitted 
  guilt. As a result, his flight after the fact was of no probative value. The 
  appellant relies on the principle set out in R. v. Arcangioli (1994), 87 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 289 (S.C.C.) at 300-01: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The test articulated in Myers provides helpful guidance on the inferences that 
  may be drawn from evidence of an accused's flight (or other possible indicia 
  of consciousness of guilt, such as lying). Such evidence can serve the function 
  of indicating consciousness of guilt only if it relates to a particular offence. 
  Consequently, where an accused's conduct may be equally explained by reference 
  to consciousness of guilt of two or more offences, and where an accused has 
  admitted culpability in respect of one or more of these offences, a trial judge 
  should instruct a jury that such evidence has no probative value with respect 
  to any particular offence. </p>
<p>
  [21] It is important to note in what context Crown counsel referred to the evidence 
  of flight. It is found in the context of several pages of transcript where the 
  Crown reviews the evidence discovered after the fact that would support an inference 
  that Haughton was the gunman. This evidence included, among other things, the 
  gun holster in his pant pocket; the money on his person; the location of the 
  gun under the passenger seat of the car where it was easily accessible from 
  the back [where Haughton was when the car was stopped]; the other items from 
  the robbery found in the back of the car where the Crown suggested one would 
  expect them to be if Haughton had placed them there while lying down on the 
  back seat; and the clothes found in the car. The Crown then made the reference 
  to flight and immediately suggested that Haughton's story about another robber 
  doing the deed and handing him everything was simply incredible. </p>
<p>
  [22] It is my view that in the circumstances of this case, an instruction in 
  the terms set out in Arcangioli would have unduly complicated matters and was 
  not necessary. It is particularly noteworthy that defence counsel at trial did 
  not ask the trial judge to give such an instruction. Further, the trial judge 
  instructed the jury generally with respect to the after-the-fact conduct that 
  "it may help; it may not help" in deciding who committed the robbery. 
  She instructed them that "the words or conduct may be those of an innocent 
  person who simply wants to avoid involvement in a police investigation or embarrassment 
  for himself or others". If the jury found as a fact that the accused did 
  or said those things, they "should consider next whether this was because 
  he committed the offence or offences charged or for some other reason."</p>
<p>
  [23] Given the context, I find no merit to this ground of appeal and would not 
  give effect to it. </p>
<p>
  (4) Reasonable Doubt Arising From the Absence of Evidence</p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant contends that one portion of the charge completely negated 
  the trial judge's earlier correct instruction on how an absence of evidence 
  could raise a reasonable doubt. He relies on the following portion of the charge: </p>
<p class="indent">
  You heard evidence that there were other things that the police could have done 
  to more accurately determine, or better prove, let's put it that way, that Mr. 
  Haughton was the perpetrator of the robbery. For example, the floppy hat in 
  the car or the black sweatshirt in the car with the "Bulls" insignia 
  on it could have been analyzed for hair fibres or DNA according to one of the 
  witnesses, I think P.C. McAllister, or it could have been analyzed to determine 
  whether it was someone else who did the actual act of taking Mr. Baker's money. 
  You may not speculate on what the results might have been of any investigation 
  that was not done. You must not use any frustration you may feel toward the 
  police investigation in determining the guilt or not of Mr. Haughton. You must 
  simply deal with the evidence that you have heard in court and the exhibits 
  that were filed during the trial in determining these issues. </p>
<p>
  [25] The appellant submits that this case is indistinguishable from the decision 
  in R. v. Bryce, [2000] O.J. No. 216 (C.A.) where this court held that a later 
  modification of the standard Lifchus charge which took away the option of a 
  reasonable doubt raised by an absence of evidence constituted reversible error. 
  I do not agree. The impugned portion of the charge in Bryce effectively misdirected 
  the jury that a reasonable doubt cannot arise from a lack of evidence. It read 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I indicated to you earlier reasonable doubt is logically derived from the evidence 
  tendered at a trial, or from a lack of evidence tendered at a trial. I realized 
  in saying that to you, I was in error. A reasonable doubt is logically derived 
  from the evidence tendered at a trial. I will stop there and I will repeat that. 
  A reasonable doubt is logically derived from the evidence tendered at a trial. 
  The law has since changed regarding the lack of evidence. So to make it clear, 
  a reasonable doubt is logically derived from the evidence tendered at a trial. 
  </p>
<p>
  [26] When read in context, the instruction in this case does not have the same 
  effect. The trial judge correctly charged the jury five times that a reasonable 
  doubt is one that arises from the evidence or the lack of evidence - twice in 
  her opening remarks and three times in her closing. In effect, the trial judge 
  in the above-noted passage was encouraging the jury to use a reasoned approach 
  in considering any gap in the evidence. The charge, when read as a whole, does 
  not give rise to a reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the correct 
  standard of proof. </p>
<p>
  [27] I do not accept the appellant's submission that Crown counsel's questioning 
  of the witnesses on police procedures exacerbated the situation and undermined 
  the presumption of innocence or the right to silence. The context in which this 
  evidence was elicited is the following. Defence counsel, in his cross-examination 
  of one of the police officers, questioned why certain forensic tests had not 
  been done on the clothing found in the vehicle. The officer testified that where 
  identity was a primary issue of concern, that option was available. If, in the 
  investigator's opinion, identity is not in issue, evidence will generally not 
  be submitted for DNA testing. In this particular investigation, it was felt 
  that it was not necessary to do forensic testing. In re-examination, Crown counsel 
  asked what the police policy was if the defence were to ask for samples for 
  testing. The officer said that the samples would be submitted for testing. Crown 
  counsel then asked if, to the officer's knowledge, any samples had been requested 
  by the defence for testing. The officer said no. The latter question was later 
  put to the investigating officer and he confirmed that no request had been made 
  by the defence for samples to be tested. </p>
<p>
  [28] When viewed in context, these passages simply served to explain to the 
  jury why certain evidence is either available or unavailable for its consideration. 
  Such an explanation in no way undermines the presumption of innocence and does 
  not interfere with an accused's right to silence. </p>
<p>
  [29] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal against conviction.</p>
<p>
  (5) Appeal against sentence </p>
<p>
  [30] The appellant contends that, on sentencing, the trial judge erred in considering 
  the accused's pre-existing weapons prohibition as an aggravating factor while 
  at the same time making his sentence for 'possession of a weapon while prohibited' 
  consecutive to his other sentences. It is submitted that, in light of this error, 
  it falls to this court to consider the appellant's sentence afresh and that 
  the sentence should be reduced by two years.</p>
<p>
  [31] On my reading of the record, it seems clear that the trial judge did not, 
  in effect, punish the appellant twice as contended. In deciding to impose a 
  consecutive sentence on the weapons offence, the trial judge specifically stated: 
  "Again, in doing so I have considered the sentence I am imposing in total 
  in relation to the counts with respect to which I am obliged to sentence Mr. 
  Haughton." Further, the sentence was a fit one. Indeed, it was within the 
  range suggested by defence counsel at trial. </p>
<p>
  [32] I would grant leave to appeal the sentence but would dismiss the appeal.
