<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view there was some evidence from which it can be inferred that 
  the respondent Ritz was a director of the corporation at the relevant times. 
</p>
<p>[2] The motion judge appeared to have weighed the evidence in concluding that 
  there was no genuine issue for trial. With respect, he erred in that regard. 
</p>
<p>[3] In respect of the respondent Aussem in the St. Pierre claim, the evidence 
  that suggests he was appointed a director of the corporation does not include 
  any evidence that he agreed to the appointment. We therefore agree with the 
  motion judge that on the record there is no genuine issue for trial with respect 
  to the respondent Aussem. </p>
<p>[4] We are also satisfied that on the limitation issue in the Henderson action, 
  there is a genuine issue for trial.</p>
<p>[5] In the result, we would allow the appeal in both actions in respect of 
  the respondent Ritz, and dismiss the appeal in the St. Pierre action with respect 
  to the respondent Aussem.</p>
