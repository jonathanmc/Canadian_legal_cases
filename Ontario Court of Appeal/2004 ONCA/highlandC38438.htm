<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: February 5, 2004</p>
<p>[1] Allan Huppe was a financial and investment advisor. He made an assignment 
  in bankruptcy on May 7, 1997. He is serving a three-year sentence at a penitentiary 
  in New York State for wire fraud and embezzlement.</p>
<p>[2] The appellant is an unsecured creditor in Huppe's bankruptcy claiming $1,321,415.61. 
  The respondent (and/or her husband) gave Huppe at least $100,000 in 1995 and 
  1996 for investment purposes. In April 1998, eleven months after his bankruptcy, 
  Huppe returned $100,000 US (approximately $150,000 CDN) to the respondent. The 
  appellant obtained an order pursuant to s. 38 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
  Act (&quot;the BIA&quot;) granting it the right to bring an action against the 
  respondent to recover this money.</p>
<p>[3] In a judgment released on June 14, 2002, Greer J. held that the respondent 
  was entitled to retain $100,674 of the funds received from Huppe. She also held 
  that the respondent had to turn over the remaining $49,326 to the appellant. 
  The appellant appeals the first component of the judgment; the respondent cross-appeals 
  the second component.</p>
<p>[4] The application judge affirmed the respondent's entitlement to the $100,674 
  on two bases: (1) the existence of an implied trust in the arrangement between 
  the respondent and Huppe; and (2) the respondent came within s. 99(1) of the 
  BIA relating to after-acquired property.</p>
<p>[5] With respect, we think that the application judge erred in reaching these 
  conclusions.</p>
<p>[6] We agree with the application judge that &quot;none of the documentation 
  shows that the money, which went over to Huppe, was fixed with an express trust&quot;. 
  We also agree with her that a trust can be implied, provided there is compliance 
  with the three certainties for the existence of any trust-intention, subject 
  matter and objects.</p>
<p>[7] The application judge mentioned the three certainties, but she did not 
  apply them. In our view, the same documentation that led her to conclude that 
  there was no express trust also belies the existence of an implied trust, especially 
  one in favour of the respondent. Huppe's own financial records refer to a management 
  contract between his company and Dr. Douglas Aldridge, the respondent's husband. 
  When Huppe, prior to bankruptcy, returned some money to the respondent, the 
  stated purpose was &quot;note repayment&quot;. Huppe transferred the money he 
  received from the Aldridges to his corporate account and he did not keep it 
  separate from his other funds. When he became bankrupt, Huppe did not declare 
  a trust in favour of the respondent; indeed, he did not even acknowledge the 
  California account from which the later payments to the respondent came. Moreover, 
  the respondent was not the only person to receive money from the California 
  account - his wife, another third party and Huppe himself also received payments. 
  In our view, these factors, and many others, make it impossible for the respondent 
  to establish that there was a valid trust, express or implied.</p>
<p>[8] As part of the cross-appeal, the respondent submitted that the appellant 
  had failed to establish that the funds in the California bank account were Huppe's 
  funds. We disagree. The application judge found that this account contained 
  Huppe's money and the unanswered evidence (including Huppe's name on the account 
  and the disbursements from it to Huppe and his wife) supports this conclusion.</p>
<p>[9] The application judge's reliance on s. 99(1) of the BIA is also, with respect, 
  misplaced. It is inconsistent with her implied trust reasoning: the implied 
  trust is grounded in money given to Huppe before his bankruptcy; the after-acquired 
  property analysis applies only to assets obtained by the bankrupt after bankruptcy. 
  Moreover, there is nothing in the record to support the &quot;good faith&quot; 
  and &quot;value&quot; components of the test for the application of s. 99(1).</p>
<p>[10] Finally, the respondent advanced an alternative argument, namely that 
  the application judge did not have jurisdiction to determine the application 
  because the respondent was a stranger to the bankruptcy proceedings and the 
  matter did not fall within rule 14.05(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. We 
  disagree. The claim advanced by the appellant related directly to Huppe's bankruptcy 
  under the BIA and the appellant's status as a major creditor of the bankrupt. 
  Indeed, a successful application had the potential to lead directly to the respondent 
  becoming a creditor in the bankruptcy: see Houlden and Morawetz, The 2000 Annotated 
  Bankruptcy &amp; Insolvency Act, (Carswell, Toronto: 1999) p. 639. Moreover, 
  no issue was raised before the application judge about the applicability of 
  rule 14.05(3) in these proceedings. We cannot say, on the basis of the record, 
  that the application is outside this rule.</p>
<p>[11] The appeal is allowed and it is ordered that the respondent pay the appellant 
  the $100,000 US she received from Huppe in 1998 in accordance with s. 121 of 
  the Courts of Justice Act. The cross-appeal is dismissed.</p>
