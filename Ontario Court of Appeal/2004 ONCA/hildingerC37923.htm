<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Douglas H. Lissaman of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated February 13, 2002.</p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.:</p>
<p>
  A. Introduction</p>
<p>
  [1] This appeal concerns the custody of a young girl, Nancy Mae Hildinger, four 
  and a half years old at the time of trial and nearly six when the appeal was 
  argued. The appellant, Daniel Carroll, and the respondent, Jean Hildinger, are 
  Nancy Mae&#146;s parents. The trial judge, Lissaman J., ordered that Ms. Hildinger 
  have sole custody of Nancy Mae and that Mr. Carroll have specified access. Mr. 
  Carroll appeals, seeking an order for joint custody or a new trial. In the alternative 
  he asks for increased access. </p>
<p>[2] Ms. Hildinger and Mr. Carroll met in New York City in July 1996, where 
  they both lived at the time. She was a nurse at a local hospital. He had a senior 
  position with IBM. They began dating. Nancy was conceived in September 1996. 
  Two months later Ms. Hildinger ended the relationship. She moved to Ottawa before 
  the child was born, admittedly to try to eliminate Mr. Carroll from the child&#146;s 
  life. That did not happen.</p>
<p>[3] Nancy Mae was born in June 1997. In July 1998 McKinnon J. ordered that 
  the parties share custody but that Nancy live primarily with her mother. Mr. 
  Carroll was given access in New York City for one month in the summer and one 
  week in the spring, fall and at Christmas. </p>
<p>[4] In November 1998 Mr. Carroll arranged a job transfer to Ottawa to facilitate 
  his access to his daughter. In April 1999 Binks J. ordered an assessment of 
  the child and a trial of the issue of how the order of McKinnon J. was to be 
  implemented. However, Ms. Hildinger then brought an application for sole custody 
  of Nancy Mae. Mr. Carroll countered by claiming that he should have sole custody. 
</p>
<p>[5] The relationship between Ms. Hildinger and Mr. Carroll has been acrimonious, 
  beginning even before their daughter was born. While both love their daughter 
  they cannot agree on any matter, however small, concerning her welfare. The 
  trial judge held that the &#147;continued conflicts between Nancy Mae&#146;s 
  parents&#148; exacerbated by Mr. Carroll&#146;s move to Ottawa amounted to a 
  material change in circumstances justifying a variation of McKinnon J.&#146;s 
  joint custody order. The trial judge concluded that giving Ms. Hildinger sole 
  custody was in Nancy Mae&#146;s best interests. </p>
<p>[6] Mr. Carroll advances three submissions on appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">1) He was deprived of a fair trial for four reasons:</p>
<p class="indent">a) he was compelled to go to trial without counsel;</p>
<p class="indent">b) his position was compromised because an employee of his former 
  lawyer went to work at the law firm where Ms. Hildinger&#146;s lawyer was a 
  partner;</p>
<p class="indent">c) counsel for Ms. Hildinger gave the trial judge a written 
  copy of his opening statement before the trial began; and</p>
<p class="indent">d) he was denied a fair opportunity to present his case.</p>
<p class="indent">2) The trial judge erred in concluding that the &#147;friction 
  and disagreement&#148; between the parents precluded an order for joint custody.</p>
<p class="indent">3) In the alternative, the trial judge erred in failing to grant 
  him increased access.</p>
<p>[7] For the brief reasons that follow, I do not agree with Mr. Carroll&#146;s 
  first two submissions. I would dismiss his appeal, other than to order that 
  he is entitled to increased access to his daughter. </p>
<p>B. Discussion</p>
<p>
  First Issue: Was Mr. Carroll deprived of a fair trial?</p>
<p>
  [8] I will deal first with the four branches of Mr. Carroll&#146;s argument 
  that he was denied a fair trial.</p>
<p>a) Mr. Carroll was compelled to go to trial without counsel.</p>
<p>
  [9] The background to this submission is as follows. During the proceedings 
  leading up to the trial, Mr. Carroll had been represented by Mr. Levencrown, 
  an Ottawa family law lawyer. The trial was scheduled to begin on October 15, 
  2001 and had been marked &#147;peremptory&#148;. On October 3, 2001, Mr. Levencrown 
  resigned as Mr. Carroll&#146;s lawyer and a few days later obtained an order 
  removing himself as solicitor of record. Mr. Carroll sought an adjournment of 
  the trial. Morin J. gave Mr. Carroll a choice: he ordered that the trial would 
  be adjourned if Mr. Carroll paid Ms. Hildinger&#146;s costs thrown away in the 
  amount of $12,000; alternatively, he ordered the trial to proceed as scheduled. 
</p>
<p>[10] Mr. Carroll chose to proceed and represent himself. He now submits that 
  the order of Morin J. deprived him of a fair trial. There are three answers 
  to his submission. First, he has not appealed Morin J.&#146;s order. Second, 
  even if he can get over that hurdle, Morin J.&#146;s order is discretionary 
  and entitled to deference on appeal. I consider his exercise of discretion reasonable. 
  His costs order was obviously made to address the financial imbalance between 
  the parties. Ms. Hildinger earned less than $40,000 annually; Mr. Carroll earned 
  over $200,000. Mr. Carroll did not show that he could not pay the costs order. 
  Third, Mr. Carroll is articulate, intelligent and, as the trial judge pointed 
  out, was very active in running his custody case for years. Also, during the 
  trial he was assisted &#150; behind the scenes &#150; by Mr. Augustine, his 
  counsel on appeal. </p>
<p>b) Mr. Carroll&#146;s position was compromised because an employee of his former 
  lawyer went to work at the law firm where Ms. Hildinger&#146;s lawyer was a 
  partner. </p>
<p>
  [11] Mr. Carroll submits that Ms. Hildinger&#146;s counsel, Mr. Vallance, had 
  a conflict of interest and should not have been allowed to conduct the trial 
  for his client. He contends that the conflict compromised his right to a fair 
  trial. We permitted the parties to lead fresh evidence on this issue. Here are 
  the facts.</p>
<p>[12] A legal secretary for Mr. Levencrown during part of the time he acted 
  for Mr. Carroll was dismissed by Mr. Levencrown&#146;s firm and went to work 
  at Kimmel, Victor, Ages, where Mr. Vallance is a partner. While working for 
  Mr. Levencrown the secretary typed his correspondence to Mr. Vallance and prepared 
  court documents. She took no part in any strategy discussions between Mr. Levencrown 
  and Mr. Carroll. She left Mr. Levencrown&#146;s employ in May 2000. She began 
  working for Kimmel, Victor, Ages in October 2000. She worked exclusively for 
  Stephen Victor, another partner in the firm. She did not work for Mr. Vallance. 
</p>
<p>[13] Mr. Carroll nonetheless submits that her employment at Kimmel, Victor, 
  Ages raised a conflict of interest, which should have precluded Mr. Vallance 
  from acting for Ms. Hildinger. I see no merit in this submission.</p>
<p>[14] Most conflict of interest cases in this area deal with lawyers changing 
  law firms, not legal secretaries. Still, I accept that in some circumstances 
  a non-professional employee&#146;s change of firms could give rise to a disqualifying 
  conflict of interest. However, no such circumstances exist here. </p>
<p>[15] The Supreme Court of Canada has approved a straightforward test for determining 
  whether a conflict of interest should disqualify a lawyer or a law firm from 
  acting. The party against whom the allegation of conflict is made must demonstrate 
  that a &#147;reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential 
  information would occur.&#148; See MacDonald Estate v. Martin, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 
  1235 at paras. 44-51 and Davies, Ward &amp; Beck v. Baker and McKenzie (1998), 
  40 O.R. (3d) 257 at 258-59 (C.A.). Ms. Hildinger and her law firm easily satisfied 
  this test for these reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The secretary did not work for Mr. Vallance. She worked for another lawyer 
    on a different floor of the firm&#146;s offices.</li>
  <li>The secretary gave unchallenged evidence that she was told by her new firm 
    not to discuss the case with Mr. Vallance, she did not discuss the case with 
    him and she did no work for him on it save for photocopying a single book 
    of authorities, not knowing that it was for this case. </li>
  <li>Mr. Vallance did not have a financial relationship with the secretary. She 
    was employed by the firm&#146;s management company. Kimmel, Victor, Ages is 
    a loose association of five separate financial partnerships and economic entities 
    and each lawyer hires his or her own support staff. </li>
  <li>Kimmel, Victor, Ages instituted password protection on Ms. Hildinger&#146;s 
    file so the secretary could not gain access to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>[16] In the light of these considerations any reasonably informed member of 
  the public would be satisfied that Mr. Vallance did not use confidential information 
  obtained from Mr. Levencrown&#146;s office. </p>
<p>c) Mr. Vallance gave the trial judge a written copy of his opening statement.</p>
<p>
  [17] Before the trial began Mr. Vallance sent a written copy of his opening 
  statement to the trial judge. He said that this is a common practice. Mr. Carroll, 
  however, submits that it was unfair. I find it an odd practice, especially in 
  a case where the other side is unrepresented. But nothing in the record suggests 
  that what Mr. Vallance did prejudiced Mr. Carroll.</p>
<p>d) Mr. Carroll was denied a fair opportunity to present his case.</p>
<p>
  [18] The gravamen of this submission is that the trial judge prevented Mr. Carroll 
  from reading in portions of the examination for discovery evidence of Ms. Hildinger. 
  This submission has no merit. Although Mr. Carroll was not permitted to read 
  from Ms. Hildinger&#146;s discovery transcript, the trial judge gave him great 
  latitude in his closing argument, including permitting him to file his own written 
  submissions, which contained extensive quotes from Ms. Hildinger&#146;s discovery 
  evidence. </p>
<p>[19] I would therefore not give effect to Mr. Carroll&#146;s submission that 
  he was deprived of a fair trial. </p>
<p>Second Issue: Did the trial judge err in holding that the &#147;friction and 
  disagreement&#148; between the parents precluded an order for joint custody?</p>
<p>
  [20] Mr. Carroll makes two arguments here. First, he argues that the question 
  of sole custody should not have been an issue at the trial because the order 
  of Binks J. limited the jurisdiction of the trial judge to determining how to 
  implement the joint custody order made by McKinnon J. Second, he argues that 
  the trial judge erred by relying on this court&#146;s judgment in Baker v. Baker 
  (1979), 23 O.R. (2d) 391 to order that Ms. Hildinger have sole custody of Nancy 
  Mae. I do not accept either argument.</p>
<p>[21] The order of Binks J. did not prevent Ms. Hildinger from seeking sole 
  custody of Nancy Mae or deprive the trial judge of jurisdiction to make this 
  order. Ms. Hildinger was entitled to seek a variation of the order of McKinnon 
  J. if she could show a material change in circumstances since the making of 
  that order. The trial judge was fully justified in finding that the increase 
  in hostility between Nancy Mae&#146;s parents, aggravated by Mr. Carroll&#146;s 
  move from New York City to Ottawa, amounted to a material change in circumstances. 
  Moreover, neither party any longer wished to be governed by McKinnon J.&#146;s 
  joint custody order. Indeed, Mr. Carroll claimed sole custody and termed McKinnon 
  J.&#146;s order &#147;obsolete&#148;. </p>
<p>[22] Having found a material change in circumstances warranting a variation 
  of the order, the trial judge then held that granting Ms. Hildinger sole custody 
  was in Nancy Mae&#146;s best interests. In so holding he relied on Baker, in 
  which Lacourci&egrave;re J.A. wrote that a joint custody order is inappropriate 
  where the parents are not willing to cooperate in raising their child. In applying 
  Baker, the trial judge wrote:</p>
<p class="indent">In making Nancy Mae&#146;s mother sole custodial parent, this 
  is being done in accordance with the well-known Court of Appeal decision of 
  Baker and subsequent decisions which make it clear that joint custody is an 
  appropriate remedy only where the parties can communicate with each [other] 
  without continual friction and disagreement [citation omitted]. </p>
<p>[23] Mr. Carroll contends that Baker and the cases following it have been overtaken 
  by the custody provisions of the Children&#146;s Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. C.12 and by several recent trial decisions in which courts, in the face of 
  uncooperative relations between parents, have nonetheless granted joint custody 
  in the form of parallel parenting. Under a parallel parenting regime decision-making 
  responsibility on major matters affecting a child&#146;s welfare is divided 
  between the parents. That is what Mr. Carroll seeks. He wishes to choose Nancy 
  Mae&#146;s church and after-school activities, while leaving Ms. Hildinger to 
  choose Nancy Mae&#146;s school and healthcare providers. He submits that the 
  &#147;friction and disagreement&#148; between him and Ms. Hildinger should not 
  preclude an order for joint custody under a parallel parenting regime. He contends 
  that the trial judge was unfairly pre-disposed against making such an order. 
</p>
<p>[24] The trial judge cannot be faulted for applying the established jurisprudence 
  of this court. However, assuming without deciding that parallel parenting is 
  now a viable option where the parties are uncooperative, I see no justification 
  for it in this case. The overwhelming evidence accepted by the trial judge pointed 
  to but one conclusion: granting Ms. Hildinger sole custody was very much in 
  Nancy Mae&#146;s best interests. </p>
<p>[25] The trial judge relied principally on the two independent assessors who 
  testified before him: Lena Jones, of the Centre for Counselling and Mediation 
  in Ottawa, and Christopher Cooper, a psychiatrist. Both testified that joint 
  custody was unworkable and could be harmful to the child. </p>
<p>[26] In Ms. Jones&#146; opinion, successful joint custody at least requires 
  that the parents separate their own needs from those of the child. In her view, 
  that did not happen here. Instead, Mr. Carroll put his own needs ahead of his 
  daughter&#146;s. He has a combative personality and used threats and intimidation 
  to get his way. Therefore, Ms. Jones testified that Ms. Hildinger needed a sole 
  custody order to put limits on Mr. Carroll&#146;s inappropriate parenting requests. 
</p>
<p>[27] Dr. Cooper echoed Ms. Jones&#146; opinion. In his view, Mr. Carroll has 
  personality traits that clashed with his daughter&#146;s best interests. Like 
  Ms. Jones, Dr. Cooper believed that Mr. Carroll put his own interests ahead 
  of Nancy Mae&#146;s. Because of Mr. Carroll&#146;s and Ms. Hildinger&#146;s 
  historical lack of &#147;shared values&#148; and respect for one another as 
  parents, Dr. Cooper concluded that this case fell &#147;a fair way outside&#148; 
  the parameters of a joint custody regime. Even parallel parenting risked tensions 
  between the parents, which would carry over to Nancy Mae and disrupt her well-being. 
</p>
<p>[28] Having regard to the significant deference given to the findings of trial 
  judges in family law matters, the evidence of Ms. Jones and Dr. Cooper, which 
  was accepted by Lissaman J., forecloses appellate interference with his sole 
  custody order. Indeed, in my opinion, that was the only sensible order that 
  he could have made. The parties have no history of joint parenting; Nancy Mae 
  has lived with her mother from the day she was born; Ms. Hildinger is a good 
  and loving parent; and Mr. Carroll&#146;s hostility towards Ms. Hildinger infects 
  every aspect of Nancy Mae&#146;s day-to-day upbringing. </p>
<p>[29] I would therefore not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>Third Issue: Did the trial judge err in failing to grant Mr. Carroll increased 
  access?</p>
<p>
  [30] During the trial, the trial judge commented that he was considering expanding 
  Mr. Carroll&#146;s access. In his reasons he emphasized that Ms. Hildinger &#147;must 
  be as flexible as possible as far as access is concerned.&#148; Yet he simply 
  replicated the access ordered by Binks J. in April 1999 - every second weekend, 
  every second Wednesday, and on the American holidays &#150; and added a provision 
  for &#147;such additional and further access as may be informally agreed upon, 
  such access to be open ended.&#148;</p>
<p>[31] Mr. Carroll submits that he is entitled to an order for increased access, 
  with the additional access detailed in an order. I agree. </p>
<p>[32] In addition to having access every second weekend and on American holidays 
  as ordered by the trial judge, I would give Mr. Carroll the following access 
  to Nancy Mae:</p>
<p class="indent">1) Every Wednesday (instead of every second Wednesday) from 
  after school until 8:00 p.m.</p>
<p class="indent">2) One week in either July or August of each year, to be agreed 
  on by the parties, and failing agreement to be designated by Ms. Hildinger no 
  later than April 30 of the year in question.</p>
<p class="indent">3) From December 20 at 10:00 a.m. to December 25 at noon, in 
  even numbered years beginning in 2004; and from December 25 at noon to December 
  30 at 6:00 p.m. in odd numbered years, beginning in 2005.</p>
<p>If these terms are unworkable the parties may, within fifteen 
  days of the release of these reasons, make written submissions to the panel 
  on substitute terms. </p>
<p>C. Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [33] Mr. Carroll received a fair trial. The trial judge&#146;s order granting 
  Ms. Hildinger sole custody of Nancy Mae is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence. 
  Mr. Carroll, however, is entitled to an order for increased access. Apart from 
  ordering increased access, I would dismiss the appeal. Ms. Hildinger is entitled 
  to her costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis. I would fix those costs 
  in the amount of $12,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
