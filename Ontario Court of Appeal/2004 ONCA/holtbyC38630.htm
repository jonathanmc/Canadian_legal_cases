<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant, Holtby's Design Service Inc., appeals from the judgment 
  of Justice Meehan dated June 28, 2002, in which the appellant's action was dismissed 
  against the respondent, Joseph Ciardullo. </p>
<p>[2] We agree with the conclusion of the trial judge that there was no breach 
  of contract. The appellant purchased the property on an &quot;as is where is&quot; 
  basis. The respondent lived up to his obligation to deliver the two reports. 
  Nothing in either report constitutes a promise that the property was contamination 
  free and the respondent refused to give such a representation when asked. We 
  also agree with the trial judge that there was no negligent misrepresentation. 
  It was open to the trial judge to find that there was no duty of care owing 
  by the respondent to the appellant. We need go no further. The appeal is dismissed. 
</p>
<p>[3] Costs to the respondent are fixed in the amount of $7,500 inclusive of 
  disbursements and GST.</p>
