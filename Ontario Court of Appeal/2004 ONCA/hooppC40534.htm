<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal from the judgment of Mossip J., dated July 11, 2003, 
  dealing with the interpretation of certain provisions in a commercial lease 
  made between the respondent (the "landlord") and the appellants (the 
  "tenant") of certain lands and premises.</p>
<p>[2] A purchaser agreed to purchase all of the tenant's shares. It is conceded 
  that, under the terms of the lease, such a transaction amounts to a change in 
  control of the tenant that constitutes a "transfer" requiring the 
  landlord's consent.</p>
<p>[3] Prior to the closing of the transaction that effected the change of control 
  of the tenant, the landlord's solicitors purported to consent to the transaction, 
  while reserving all of the landlord's rights under the lease. </p>
<p>[4] The transaction was closed.</p>
<p>[5] The tenant took the position that it never agreed to a conditional consent 
  and that, pursuant to the lease provisions, once the transfer was effected the 
  landlord's only option was to terminate the lease. It argued that clause 11.03(b) 
  made the landlord's consent conditional upon the tenant and the transferee executing 
  an agreement with the landlord.</p>
<p>[6] The landlord took the position that, upon the change of control of the 
  tenant, clause 11.03(b) of the lease entitled it to an amended lease with certain 
  specified terms that included an increase in the minimum rent payable under 
  the lease in accordance with the formula therein provided and an update of the 
  terms of the lease to conform with the landlord's current form of lease. </p>
<p>[7] The applications judge held that the change in control of the tenant triggered 
  the provisions in clause 11 of the lease and that the tenant was contractually 
  and legally obliged to sign a new lease incorporating the terms contained in 
  clause 11.03, including an increase in rental payments. The landlord was also 
  entitled to recover the legal fees incurred in dealing with this matter.</p>
<p>[8] In our view, clause 11 of the lease was intended to deal with, among other 
  things, a change of corporate control of the tenant. To accede to the interpretation 
  advanced by the tenant would render much of clause 11.03(b) ineffective. Moreover, 
  such an interpretation would be inconsistent with the true intent of the parties 
  at the time of entry into the contract, which was to specify the effect of such 
  a transfer.</p>
<p>[9] We agree with the interpretation of the provisions given by the applications 
  judge and would dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at $11,368.55.</p>
