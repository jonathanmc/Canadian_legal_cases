<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Lawrence C. Kozak of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated August 5, 2003. </p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. Introduction</p>
<p> [1] Section 213(2) of the Municipal Act<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
  authorizes municipalities to pass by-laws prohibiting smoking in public places 
  and workplaces. In November 2002 the City of Greater Sudbury passed a "Smoke 
  Free Public Places and Workplaces By-law". This by-law requires employers to 
  "adopt and implement a non-smoking policy" in their workplaces. David Horton, 
  the owner of a local pub and restaurant, challenged the By-law. He acknowledged 
  that the City can prohibit smoking in his workplace, but he contends that it 
  cannot compel him to adopt a written policy. The application judge, Kozak J., 
  held that the challenged provisions of the By-law were authorized by ss. 213(2) 
  and 3(g) of the Municipal Act. Mr. Horton appeals. For the brief reasons that 
  follow I would dismiss his appeal. </p>
<p>
  B. Statutory Scheme</p>
<p>
  [2] In 1994, in response to widespread concern about the health hazards of "second 
  hand smoke", the Ontario Legislature amended the Municipal Act to permit 
  municipalities to pass by-laws regulating and prohibiting smoking in public 
  places and workplaces (S.O. 1994, c. 10, s. 21(2)). The enabling provision, 
  s. 213(2), states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The council of a local municipality may pass a by-law regulating the smoking 
  of tobacco in public places and workplaces within the municipality and designating 
  public places or workplaces or classes or parts of such places as places in 
  which smoking tobacco or holding lighted tobacco is prohibited. </p>
<p>
  [3] Section 213(3) of the Municipal Act delineates the scope of a municipality's 
  authority: </p>
<p class="indent"> A by-law made under subsection (2) may, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) define "public place" for the purposes of the by-law;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) require a person who owns or occupies a place designated 
  in the by-law to post signs referring to the prohibition or to such other information 
  relating to smoking as is required by the by-law;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) prescribe the form and content of signs referred to in clause 
  (b) and the place and manner in which the signs shall be posted;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) permit persons who own or occupy a place designated in the 
  by-law to set aside an area that meets criteria prescribed by the by-law for 
  smoking within the place;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) prescribe the criteria applicable to smoking areas in clause 
  (d), including the standards for the ventilation of such areas;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) require areas set aside for smoking in places designated 
  by the by-law to be identified as an area where smoking is permitted; and</p>
<p class="indent">(g) require the employer of a workplace or the owner or occupier 
  of a public place to ensure compliance with the by-law.</p>
<p>
  [4] Sudbury's smoking by-law came into effect on May 31, 2003. Part II of the 
  By-law addresses smoking in the workplace. Sections 7 and 8 set out general 
  prohibitions: </p>
<p class="indent"> 7. When a non-smoking policy has been adopted for a workplace, 
  no person shall smoke in the workplace. </p>
<p class="indent">8. When a non-smoking policy has been adopted for a workplace, 
  no employer shall permit smoking in the workplace.</p>
<p>
  [5] The challenged provisions of the By-law are ss. 9(1) and 10, which require 
  employers to "adopt and implement a non-smoking policy" before May 
  31, 2003, and to take steps to enforce the policy, including posting it in their 
  workplaces. These sections state: </p>
<p class="indent"> 9. (1) Every employer shall, on or before May 31, 2003, adopt 
  and implement a non-smoking policy that prohibits smoking in respect of each 
  workplace in the City of Greater Sudbury under the control, supervision or ownership 
  of the employer. </p>
<p class="center">. . . </p>
<p class="indent">10. Every employer required by this By-law to adopt and implement 
  a non-smoking policy shall: </p>
<p class="indent"> a) ensure compliance with this By-law;</p>
<p class="indent">b) inform all of the employees that smoking is prohibited in 
  the workplace except as provided by this By-law;</p>
<p class="indent">c) prohibit smoking in the workplace except as provided by this 
  By-law;</p>
<p class="indent">d) post and keep continuously displayed a copy of the non-smoking 
  policy in a prominent place(s) accessible to all employees in the workplace;</p>
<p class="indent">e) prohibit ashtrays and like paraphernalia in areas where smoking 
  is prohibited;</p>
<p class="indent">and</p>
<p class="indent">f) conspicuously post no smoking signs in areas where smoking 
  is prohibited, in accordance with Part III of this By-law.</p>
<p>
  [6] Under s. 19 of the By-law, an employer who permits smoking in the workplace 
  contrary to s. 7 is guilty of an offence. Under s. 20 of the By-law an employer 
  who refuses or fails to perform the duties imposed by the By-law is also guilty 
  of an offence. </p>
<p>
  C. Discussion</p>
<p>
  [7] After the amendment to the Municipal Act came into effect many Ontario municipalities 
  passed smoking by-laws. Local employers, perceiving that their businesses would 
  be adversely affected, challenged the validity of several of these by-laws. 
  Mr. Horton's lawsuit against Sudbury's by-law is the latest of these challenges. 
  To date, these lawsuits have failed: see Cambridge Bingo Centre Inc. v. Waterloo 
  (Regional Municipality) (2000), 14 M.P.L.R. (3d) 179 (Ont. S.C.J.) challenging 
  Waterloo's smoking by-law; Thirsty's Bar and Grill v. Waterloo (Regional Municipality) 
  (2000), 14 M.P.L.R. (3d) 207 (Ont. S.C.J.) seeking an injunction to prevent 
  Waterloo from enforcing its smoking by-law based on bad faith in engaging and 
  enforcing the by-law; Pub and Bar Coalition of Ontario v. Ottawa (City) (2001), 
  23 M.P.L.R. (3d) 42 (Ont. S.C.J.), aff'd [2002] O.J. No. 2240 (C.A.) challenging 
  the City of Ottawa's two smoking by-laws; and R. v. Ample Annie's Itty Bitty 
  Roadhouse, [2001] O.J. No. 5968 (Ct. J.) challenging the City of Guelph's smoking 
  by-law.</p>
<p>
  [8] Mr. Horton submits that the Municipal Act does not authorize Sudbury to 
  compel him to "adopt" a non-smoking policy. He contends that the word 
  "adopt" requires him to embrace the City's policy as his own. He does 
  not want to do so and says he cannot be forced to do so without appropriate 
  language in the Act, which he claims is lacking. </p>
<p>
  [9] The application judge concluded that the requirement to adopt a non-smoking 
  policy is "on a broad, liberal and benevolent interpretation of the enabling 
  legislation...specifically authorized" by s. 213(3)(g) of the Act. Under 
  this subsection a smoking by-law may "require the employer of a workplace...to 
  ensure compliance with the by-law". The application judge explained his 
  conclusion at para. 30 of his reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Accordingly Section 213(3)(g) imposes upon employers the positive duty to ensure 
  compliance. A benevolent construction of this provision leads to the reasonable 
  conclusion that in considering the section as a whole, that ensuring compliance 
  equates with the requirement that the employer adopt the City's Smoke Free Policy. 
  Relating the by-law to the plan or scheme as depicted in the enabling legislation 
  it can be seen that the by-law fits within the parameters of the enabling act. 
  </p>
<p>
  [10] I take a different view. It seems to me that adopting a policy is not the 
  same thing as ensuring compliance with it. The one precedes the other. Thus, 
  I agree with the appellant to this extent: the Municipal Act does not "specifically" 
  or expressly authorize municipalities to require an employer to adopt and implement 
  a non-smoking policy in the workplace.</p>
<p>
  [11] However, under the modern view of municipal authority, municipalities now 
  exercise both express powers and necessarily or fairly implied powers. Iacobucci 
  J. stated this principle in R. v. Sharma, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 650 at para. 25: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [A]s statutory bodies, municipalities "may exercise only those powers expressly 
  conferred by statute, those powers necessarily or fairly implied by the expressed 
  power in the statute, and those indispensable powers essential and not merely 
  convenient to the effectuation of the purposes of the corporation" [citation 
  omitted].</p>
<p>
  [12] Since Sharma, the Supreme Court of Canada has affirmed this principle on 
  numerous occasions: see for example Shell Canada Products Ltd. v. Vancouver 
  (City), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 231, Pacific National Investments Ltd. v. Victoria (City), 
  [2000] 2 S.C.R. 919 and 114957 Canada Lt&eacute;e. (Spraytech, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; 
  d'arrosage) v. Hudson (Town), [2001] 2 S.C.R. 241.</p>
<p>
  [13] To support its By-law, Sudbury must look to s. 213(2) of the Municipal 
  Act, the provision that authorizes municipalities to pass by-laws regulating 
  and prohibiting smoking in the workplace. Applying Sharma, I would frame the 
  question on this appeal as follows: can it fairly be said that s. 213(2) of 
  the Municipal Act impliedly authorizes the City of Greater Sudbury to require 
  employers to adopt and implement a non-smoking policy? I would answer this question 
  in the affirmative. </p>
<p>
  [14] My conclusion is driven largely by three considerations: the legitimate 
  purpose of the By-law, a deferential approach to judicial review of municipal 
  by-laws and the trivial burden the challenged provisions impose on employers. 
  </p>
<p>
  [15] The consultation process that led to the passage of Sudbury's smoking by-law 
  shows that it was passed for a legitimate municipal purpose: to protect the 
  health of its citizens from the dangers of second hand smoke. </p>
<p>
  [16] By-laws passed for a legitimate municipal purpose should be reviewed deferentially. 
  As this court recently affirmed in Toronto (City) v. Goldlist Properties Inc. 
  (1994), 67 O.R. (3d) 441 at para. 57: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [R]ecent jurisprudence...has emphasized the importance of enhancing local decision-making 
  and avoiding narrow and technical readings of municipal powers. In 114957 Canada 
  Lt&eacute;e. (Spraytech, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Arrosage) v. Hudson (Town), 
  [2001] 2 S.C.R. 241, 200 D.L.R. (4th) 419, at para. 21, the Supreme Court of 
  Canada stated that the courts should accord municipal powers a liberal and benevolent 
  interpretation, and that only in the clearest of cases should a municipal by-law 
  be held to be ultra vires, and approved the dictum of McLachlin J. in Shell 
  Canada Products Ltd. v. Vancouver (City), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 231, 110 D.L.R. (4th) 
  1, at para. 19, "barring clear demonstration that a municipal decision 
  was beyond its powers, courts should not so hold."</p>
<p>
  [17] On this view, the requirements of ss. 9(1) and 10 of Sudbury's By-law, 
  that employers adopt and implement a non-smoking policy and post it in their 
  workplaces, do not exceed the City's powers under s. 213(2) of the Municipal 
  Act. Put differently, the express power in s. 213(2) to prohibit smoking in 
  workplaces carries with it the implied power to require employers to adopt and 
  implement a non-smoking policy, put the policy in writing and post the policy 
  in their workplaces so that employees and patrons alike will know the ground 
  rules for smoking. </p>
<p>
  [18] Moreover, the burden imposed on employers by ss. 9(1) and 10 of the By-law 
  is hardly onerous. In the context of the By-law, the word "adopt" 
  means no more than "have". In my view, it does not require the employer 
  to write its own policy or to endorse the City's policy or to accept the City's 
  view that prohibiting smoking in the workplace is desirable. Therefore, the 
  challenged provisions of the By-law raise no free speech or civil liberties 
  concerns. This is evident from the City's guide to the By-law circulated when 
  the By-law was passed. The guide includes a "sample non-smoking policy" 
  acceptable to the City. This single page document states simply: </p>
<p class="indent"> Effective May 31, 2003, a Non-Smoking Policy will prohibit 
  smoking in all interior areas of these premises. There will be no allowance 
  for designated smoking rooms not established in accordance with City of Greater 
  Sudbury By-law 2001-7L.</p>
<p class="indent">Changes to the smoking policy are in accordance with the City 
  of Greater Sudbury's Smoke-Free Public Places and Workplaces By-law and are 
  in response to concerns about the health hazards of second-hand smoke. We hope 
  to help reduce the potential smoke-related health problems of our employees 
  by promoting a completely smoke-free work environment. </p>
<p>
  Significantly, the bottom of the sample policy has these words: "A non-smoking 
  workplace policy as required by City of Greater Sudbury By-law 2002-300." 
  </p>
<p>
  [19] This sample policy confirms that no employer is required to write its own 
  policy. The words at the bottom confirm that by adopting and even posting a 
  non-smoking policy, an employer is not endorsing the City's policy, but simply 
  adhering to the By-law. </p>
<p>
  [20] For these reasons I would reject the appellant's contention that Sudbury's 
  smoking by-law exceeds the municipality's powers under s. 213(2) of the Municipal 
  Act. </p>
<p>
  D. Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [21] In my view, ss. 9(1) and 10 of the City of Greater Sudbury's Smoke Free 
  Public Places and Workplaces by-law are impliedly authorized by s. 213(2) of 
  the Municipal Act. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs to the 
  City on a partial indemnity basis in the agreed on amount of $10,000 inclusive 
  of disbursements and GST. </p>
