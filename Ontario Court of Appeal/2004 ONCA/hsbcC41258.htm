<p>On appeal from the orders of Justice Harriet Sachs dated December 19, 2003, 
  and the order of Justice James M. Farley dated January 14, 2004.</p>
<p>
  R. A. BLAIR J.A.: </p>
<p> [1] Regal Pacific (Holdings) Limited is the 100% shareholder of Regal Constellation 
  Hotel Limited, the company that operated the Regal Constellation Hotel near 
  Pearson Airport in Toronto. The hotel is bankrupt and in receivership.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [2] Deloitte &amp; Touche Inc., the receiver, has agreed to sell the assets 
  of the hotel to 2031903 Ontario Inc. ("203"). The sale was approved, 
  and a vesting order issued, by Sachs J. on December 19, 2003. Following a hearing 
  on January 15, 2004, Farley J. approved the payment of $23,500,000 from the 
  sale proceeds to the hotel's secured creditor, HSBC Bank of Canada ("HSBC"), 
  and as well approved the conduct of the receiver in the receivership and passed 
  its accounts.</p>
<p>
  [3] This appeal involves an attempt by Regal Pacific, in its capacity as shareholder 
  of the bankrupt hotel, to set aside the orders of Sachs J. and Farley J., and 
  thus to set aside the sale transaction between the receiver and 203. It is based 
  upon the argument that the receiver failed to disclose to Regal Pacific and 
  to Sachs J. the name of one of the members of the consortium lying behind the 
  purchaser, 203, and that this failure to disclose tainted the fairness and integrity 
  of the receivership process to such an extent that it must be set aside. Farley 
  J. was made aware of the information. However, his failure to grant an adjournment 
  of the hearing respecting approval of the receiver's conduct in the face of 
  Regal Pacific's fresh discovery of the information, and his conclusion that 
  the information was irrelevant to the receiver's duties with respect to the 
  sale process, are said to constitute reversible error. </p>
<p>
  [4] In a separate motion 203 also seeks to quash the appeal on the ground it 
  is moot.</p>
<p>
  [5] For the reasons that follow, I would quash the appeal from the vesting order 
  and I would otherwise dismiss the appeals.</p>
<p>
  Facts</p>
<p>
  [6] The hotel has been in financial difficulties for some time. It is old and 
  in need of repair and renovation. Because the premises no longer comply with 
  the requisite fire code regulations, and because liability insurance is difficult 
  to obtain, they have been closed for some time. In addition, the hotel has suffered 
  from the decrease in air passenger traffic following the events of September 
  11, 2001, and the aftermath of the SARS outbreak in Toronto in early 2003. It 
  is thus an asset of declining value.</p>
<p>
  [7] At the time of the appointment of the receiver, the hotel was in default 
  in its payments to HSBC, which was owed $33,850,000. In fact, HSBC had made 
  demand for repayment in November 2001 and as a result Regal Pacific and the 
  hotel had commenced searching for a purchaser. They retained Colliers International 
  Hotels ("Colliers") to market the hotel.</p>
<p>
  [8] Several bids were received, and in the fall of 2002 a share-purchase transaction 
  was entered into between Regal Pacific and a company controlled by the Orenstein 
  Group. The purchase price was $45 million and included the purchase of Regal 
  Pacific's shares in the hotel together with other assets. The transaction was 
  not completed, however, and Regal Pacific and the Orenstein Group are presently 
  in litigation as a result. The existence of this litigation is not without significance 
  in these proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [9] When the foregoing transaction failed to close, in June 2003, the bank commenced 
  its application for the appointment of a receiver. On July 4, 2003, Cumming 
  J. granted the receivership order.</p>
<p>
  [10] The receiver and Colliers continued the efforts to market the hotel. The 
  receiver's supplemental report indicates that "an investment profile of 
  the hotel was distributed to more than five hundred potential investors, a Confidential 
  Information Memorandum was distributed to eighty potential purchasers, tours 
  of the Hotel were conducted for twenty-three parties, and a Standard Offer to 
  Purchase Form was provided to 42 purchasers". As of August 28, 2003, the 
  deadline for the submission of binding offers, 13 offers had been received. 
  After reviewing these offers with HSBC, the receiver accepted an offer from 
  203 to purchase the assets of the hotel for $25 million, subject to court approval 
  (the "First 203 Offer").</p>
<p>
  [11] A summary of the thirteen bids setting out their proposed purchase prices, 
  the deposits made with them, and their conditions, is set out in Appendix 1 
  of the receiver's supplemental report. Five of the bids were not accompanied 
  by a deposit, as required by the terms of the sale process approved by the court. 
  The receiver went back to each of the bidders who had not provided a deposit 
  and gave them a few more days to submit the deposit. None of them did so.</p>
<p>
  [12] The First 203 Offer was for the fourth highest purchase price. It was accompanied 
  by a $1 million deposit, as required, and it was unconditional. The second and 
  third highest bids were not accompanied by the requisite deposit. The highest 
  bid, by Hospitality Investors Group LLC ("HIG") was for $31 million. 
  While the HIG bid was accompanied by a $1 million non-certified deposit cheque, 
  however, the receiver was advised that the deposit cheque submitted could not 
  be honoured if presented for payment, and the offer was withdrawn by HIG. </p>
<p>
  [13] HIG is a company controlled by the Orenstein Group. The withdrawal of its 
  $31 million offer is the subject of some controversy in the proceedings, and 
  I shall return to that turn of events in a moment.</p>
<p>
  [14] Of the remaining bids, one was rejected as inordinately low. Three of the 
  remaining six were for the same $25 million purchase price as that offered by 
  203. They were rejected because they were subject to conditions and the First 
  203 Offer was not. The rest were rejected because their proposed purchase price 
  was lower.</p>
<p>
  [15] On September 9, 2003, Cameron J. approved the sale to 203. At this hearing 
  Regal Pacific expressed a concern that 203 might be connected to the Orenstein 
  Group. Counsel for Regal Pacific states that Cameron J. was advised by counsel 
  for the receiver that there was no such connection. It is not clear on the record 
  whether this statement was accurate in fact, but there is no suggestion that 
  counsel for the receiver was at that time aware of any Orenstein Group connection 
  to 203. Mr. Orenstein's personal involvement did not seem to come until sometime 
  later in October, following the failure of the First 203 Offer to close.</p>
<p>
  [16] At the receiver's request Cameron J. also granted an order sealing the 
  receiver's supplemental report respecting the sale process in order to protect 
  the confidential information regarding the pricing and terms of the other bids 
  outlined above, in case the First 203 Offer did not close and it proved necessary 
  for the receiver to renegotiate with the other offerors. This meant that Regal 
  Pacific was not privy to the information contained in it.</p>
<p>
  [17] The First 203 Offer did not close, as scheduled, on October 10. This led 
  to proceedings by the receiver to terminate the agreement and for the return 
  of the $2 million in deposit funds that had been submitted by 203. These proceedings 
  were settled, with the commercial list assistance of Farley J. But the settled 
  transaction did not close either. As a result of the minutes of settlement, 
  the First 203 Offer was terminated and 203 forfeited a $2.5 million deposit 
  plus $500,000 in carrying costs.</p>
<p>
  [18] The receiver renewed its efforts to find a purchaser for the hotel. In 
  what was intended to be a second round of bidding, it instructed Colliers to 
  continue its search. Between Colliers and the receiver all thirteen of the original 
  bidders referred to above, including 203, were canvassed again in an effort 
  to generate new offers. Except for a second proposal from 203 ("the Second 
  203 Offer"), none was forthcoming.</p>
<p>
  [19] The Second 203 Offer was for $24 million. It was again unconditional and 
  this time was buttressed by a $20 million credit facility provided by the intervenor, 
  Aareal Bank A.G. It was also accompanied by a certified and non-refundable deposit 
  cheque for $2 million. The receiver was concerned that the market for the hotel 
  was in a state of steady decline and that the creditors' positions would only 
  worsen if a sale could not be completed expeditiously. With a purchase price 
  of $24 million, HSBC would be suffering a shortfall on its secured debt of approximately 
  $9 million; in addition there are unsecured creditors of the hotel with claims 
  exceeding $2 million. As the receiver had not been able to generate any other 
  new offers at a price comparable to the $24 million, and Colliers had not been 
  able to identify any new purchasers, the receiver accepted the Second 203 Offer 
  and entered into a new agreement with 203 on December 9, 2003, with a projected 
  closing date of January 5, 2004. Given the $3 million in deposits that 203 had 
  previously forfeited, the receiver views the purchase price as being the equivalent 
  of $27 million.</p>
<p>
  [20] On December 19, 2003, Sachs J. approved the sale of the hotel to 203. She 
  also granted a vesting order pursuant to which title to the hotel would be conveyed 
  to 203 on closing. The transaction closed on January 6, 2004. 203 paid the receiver 
  $24 million and registered the vesting order on title. Aareal Bank's $20 million 
  advance is secured on title based on that vesting order. The hotel's indebtedness 
  to HSBC Bank of Canada has been paid down by $20.5 million from the sale proceeds.</p>
<p>
  [21] A few days later Regal Pacific learned from an article in the Toronto Star 
  newspaper that the hotel had been sold "to the Orenstein Group". A 
  motion was pending before Farley J. on January 15, 2004, for approval of the 
  receiver's conduct and related relief. Regal sought an adjournment of that motion 
  on the basis of the prior non-disclosure of the Orenstein Group's involvement 
  in the 203 offers. When the adjournment request was taken under advisement, 
  Regal Pacific opposed approval of the receiver's conduct on the basis that the 
  failure to advise it and Sachs J. of the Orenstein Group's involvement tainted 
  the fairness and integrity of the process. Farley J. refused the adjournment 
  request, and approved the receiver's conduct and accounts. He concluded that 
  the identity of the principals behind the purchaser was not material. In this 
  regard he said: </p>
<p class="indent"> While Mr. Rueter alludes to "the sales process was manipulated", 
  I do not see that anything that the Receiver did was in aid of, or assisted 
  such (as alleged). The identity of who the principals were was not in issue 
  so long as a deal could be closed without a vendor take back mortgage.</p>
<p class="indent">. . .</p>
<p class="indent">It seems to me that the Receiver acted properly and within the 
  mandate given it from time to time by the court. It fulfilled its prime purpose 
  of obtaining as high a value [as] it could for the hotel after an approved marketing 
  campaign. Vis-&agrave;-vis the Receiver and that duty, it does not appear to 
  me that the identity of the principals, but more importantly that there was 
  an overlap regarding the aborted purchaser from Holdings prior to the receivership, 
  HIG and 203, is of any moment.</p>
<p>
  Standard of Review</p>
<p>
  [22] The orders appealed from are discretionary in nature. An appeal court will 
  only interfere with such an order where the judge has erred in law, seriously 
  misapprehended the evidence, or exercised his or her discretion based upon irrelevant 
  or erroneous considerations or failed to give any or sufficient weight to relevant 
  considerations. </p>
<p>
  [23] Underlying these considerations are the principles the courts apply when 
  reviewing a sale by a court-appointed receiver. They exercise considerable caution 
  when doing so, and will interfere only in special circumstances - particularly 
  when the receiver has been dealing with an unusual or difficult asset. Although 
  the courts will carefully scrutinize the procedure followed by a receiver, they 
  rely upon the expertise of their appointed receivers, and are reluctant to second-guess 
  the considered business decisions made by the receiver in arriving at its recommendations. 
  The court will assume that the receiver is acting properly unless the contrary 
  is clearly shown. See Royal Bank of Canada v. Soundair Corp. (1991), 4 O.R. 
  (3d) 1 (C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [24] In Soundair, at p. 6, Galligan J.A. outlined the duties of a court when 
  deciding whether a receiver who has sold a property has acted properly. Those 
  duties, in no order of priority, are to consider and determine: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) whether the receiver has made a sufficient effort to get 
  the best price and has not acted improvidently;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the interests of the parties;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the efficacy and integrity of the process by which offers 
  are obtained; and</p>
<p class="indent">(d) whether there has been unfairness in the working our of 
  the process.</p>
<p>[25] In Soundair as well, McKinlay J.A. emphasized the importance of protecting 
  the integrity of the procedures followed by a court-appointed receiver "in 
  the interests of both commercial morality and the future confidence of business 
  persons in their dealings with receivers". </p>
<p>
  [26] A court-appointed receiver is an officer of the court. It has a fiduciary 
  duty to act honestly and fairly on behalf of all claimants with an interest 
  in the debtor's property, including the debtor (and, where the debtor is a corporation, 
  its shareholders). It must make candid and full disclosure to the court of all 
  material facts respecting pending applications, whether favourable or unfavourable. 
  See Toronto-Dominion Bank v. Usarco Ltd. (2001) 196 D.L.R. (4th) 448 (Ont. C.A.), 
  per Austin J.A. at paras. 28 - 31, and the authorities referred to by him, for 
  a more elaborate outline of these principles. It has been said with respect 
  to a court-appointed receiver's standard of care that the receiver "must 
  act with meticulous correctness, but not to a standard of perfection": 
  Bennett on Receiverships, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1999) at p. 181, cited 
  in Toronto-Dominion Bank v. Usarco, supra, at p. 459.</p>
<p>
  [27] The foregoing principles must be kept in mind when considering the exercise 
  of discretion by the motions judges in the context of these proceedings.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  The Vesting Order and the Motion to Quash</p>
<p>
  [28] Aareal Bank A.G. and 203 sought to quash the appeal on the basis that it 
  is moot. They argue that once the vesting order granted by Sachs J. was registered 
  on title - no stay having been obtained - its effect was spent, the court's 
  power to set it aside is extinguished, and no appeal can lie from it. Because 
  all the parties were prepared to argue the appeal, we heard the submissions 
  on the motion to quash during the argument of the appeal on the merits. </p>
<p>
  [29] In my opinion the appeal from the vesting order should be quashed because 
  the appeal is moot. </p>
<p>
  [30] Sachs J.'s order of December 19, 2003 granted a vesting order directing 
  the land registrar at Toronto, in the land titles system, to record 203 as the 
  owner of the hotel. The order was subject to two conditions, namely, that 203 
  pay the purchase price and comply with all of its obligations on closing of 
  the transaction and that the vesting order be delivered to 203. These conditions 
  were complied with on January 6, 2004, and the vesting order was registered 
  on title on that date. Aareal Bank registered its $20 million mortgage against 
  the title to the hotel property following registration of the vesting order.</p>
<p>
  [31] In Ontario, the power to grant a vesting order is conferred by the Courts 
  of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, s. 100, which provides as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A court may by order vest in any person an interest in real or personal property 
  that the court has authority to order be disposed of, encumbered or conveyed.</p>
<p>
  [32] The vesting order itself is a creature of statute, although it has its 
  origins in equitable concepts regarding the enforcement of remedies granted 
  by the Court of Chancery. Vesting orders were discussed by this court in Chippewas 
  of Sarnia Band v. Canada (2000), 195 D.L.R. (4th) 135 at 227, where it was observed 
  that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Vesting orders are equitable in origin and discretionary in nature. The Court 
  of Chancery made in personam orders, directing parties to deal with property 
  in accordance with the judgment of the court. Judgments of the Court of Chancery 
  were enforced on proceedings for contempt, followed by imprisonment or sequestration. 
  The statutory power to make a vesting order supplemented the contempt power 
  by allowing the Court to effect the change of title directly: see McGhee, Snell's 
  Equity 30th ed., (London: Sweet and Maxwell, 2000) at 41-42 [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [33] A vesting order, then, has a dual character. It is on the one hand a court 
  order ("allowing the court to effect the change of title directly"), 
  and on the other hand a conveyance of title (vesting "an interest in real 
  or personal property" in the party entitled thereto under the order). This 
  duality has important ramifications for an appeal of the original court decision 
  granting the vesting order because, in my view, once the vesting order has been 
  registered on title its attributes as a conveyance prevail and its attributes 
  as an order are spent; the change of title has been effected. Any appeal from 
  it is therefore moot.</p>
<p>
  [34] I reach this conclusion for the following reasons.</p>
<p> [35] In its capacity as an order, a vesting order is in the ordinary course 
  subject to appeal. In Ontario, however, the filing of a notice of appeal does 
  not automatically stay the order and, in the absence of such a stay, it remains 
  effective and may be registered on title under the land titles system - indeed, 
  the land registrar is required to register it on a proper application to do 
  so: see the Land Titles Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.5, ss.25 and 69. In this respect, 
  an application for registration based on a judgment or court order need only 
  be supported by an affidavit of a solicitor deposing that the judgment or order 
  is still in full force and effect and has not been stayed; there is no requirement 
  - as there is in some other jurisdictions<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> 
  - to show that no appeal is pending and that all appeal rights have terminated: 
  see Ontario Land Titles Regulations, O. Reg 26/99, s. 4.</p>
<p>
  [36] Appeal rights may be protected by obtaining a stay, which precludes registration 
  of the vesting order on title pending the disposition of the appeal. Do those 
  appeal rights remain alive, however, where no stay has been obtained and the 
  order has been registered? </p>
<p>
  [37] In answering that question I start with the provisions of ss. 69 and 78 
  of the Land Titles Act, which deal, respectively, with vesting orders (specifically) 
  and the effect of registration (generally). They state in part, as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 69(1) Where by order of a court of competent jurisdiction ... 
  registered land or any interest therein is stated by the order ... to vest, 
  be vested or become vested in, or belong to ... any person other than the registered 
  owner of the land, the registered owner shall be deemed for the purposes of 
  this Act to remain the owner thereof,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) until an application to be registered as owner is made by 
  or on behalf of the ... other person in or to whom the land is stated to be 
  vested or to belong; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) until the land is transferred to the ... person by the registered 
  owner, as the case may be, in accordance with the order or Act.</p>
<p class="indent">78 (4) When registered, an instrument shall be deemed to be 
  embodied in the register and to be effective according to its nature and intent, 
  and to create, transfer, charge or discharge, as the case requires, the land 
  or estate or interest therein mentioned in the register [italics added]. </p>
<p> [38] Upon registration, then, a vesting order is deemed "to be embodied in 
  the register and to be effective according to its nature and intent". Here the 
  nature and effect of Sachs J.'s vesting order is to transfer absolute title 
  in the hotel to 203, free and clear of encumbrances.<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> 
  When it is "embodied in the register" it becomes a creature of the land titles 
  system and subject to the dictates of that regime. </p>
<p>
  [39] Once a vesting order that has not been stayed is registered on title, therefore, 
  it is effective as a registered instrument and its characteristics as an order 
  are, in my view, overtaken by its characteristics as a registered conveyance 
  on title. In a way somewhat analogous to the merger of an agreement of purchase 
  and sale into the deed on the closing of a real estate transaction, the character 
  of a vesting order as an "order" is merged into the instrument of 
  conveyance it becomes on registration. It cannot be attacked except by means 
  that apply to any other instrument transferring absolute title and registered 
  under the land titles system. Those means no longer include an attempt to impeach 
  the vesting order by way of appeal from the order granting it because, as an 
  order, its effect is spent. Any such appeal would accordingly be moot. </p>
<p>
  [40] This interpretation of the effect of registration of a vesting order is 
  consistent with the purpose of the land titles regime and the philosophy lying 
  behind it. It ensures that disputes respecting the registered title are resolved 
  under the rubric of that regime and within the scheme provided by the Land Titles 
  Act. This promotes confidence in the system and enhances the certainty required 
  in commercial and real estate transactions that must be able to rely upon the 
  integrity of the register.</p>
<p>
  [41] Donald H.L. Lamont described the purposes of the land titles system very 
  succinctly in his text, Lamont on Real Estate Conveyancing, 2nd ed. looseleaf 
  (Toronto: Carswell, 1991) vol. 1 at 1-10, as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> The basis of the system is that the Act authoritatively establishes 
  title by declaring, under a guarantee of indemnity, that a certain parcel of 
  land is vested in a named person, subject to some special circumstances. Early 
  defects are cured when the land is brought under the land titles system, and 
  thenceforth investigation of the prior history of the title is not necessary.</p>
<p class="indent">No transfer is effective until recorded; once recorded, however, 
  the title cannot, apart from fraud, be upset [italics added].</p>
<p>
  [42] Epstein J. elaborated further on the origins, purpose and philosophy behind 
  the regime in Durrani v. Augier (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 353 (S.C.J.). At paras. 
  40 - 42 she observed: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [40] The land titles system was established in Ontario in 1885, and was modeled 
  on the English Land Transfer Act of 1875. It is currently known as the Land 
  Titles Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.5. Most Canadian provinces have similar legislation.</p>
<p>
  [41] The essential purpose of land titles legislation is to provide the public 
  with the security of title and facility of transfer: Di Castri, Registration 
  of Title to Land, vol. 2 looseleaf (Toronto: Carswell, 1987) at p. 17-32. The 
  notion of title registration establishes title by setting up a register and 
  guaranteeing that a person named as the owner has perfect title, subject only 
  to registered encumbrances and enumerated statutory exceptions.</p>
<p>
  [42] The philosophy of land titles system embodies three principles, namely, 
  the mirror principle, where the register is a perfect mirror of the state of 
  title; the curtain principle, which holds that a purchaser need not investigate 
  the history of past dealings with the land, or search behind the title as depicted 
  on the register; and the insurance principle, where the state guarantees the 
  accuracy of the register and compensates any person who suffers loss as the 
  result of an inaccuracy. These principles form the doctrine of indefeasibility 
  of title and is the essence of the land titles system: Marcia Neave, "Indefeasibility 
  of Title in the Canadian Context" (1976), 26 U.T.L.J. 173 at p. 174.</p>
<p>
  [43] Certainty of title and the ability of a bona fide purchaser for valuable 
  consideration to rely upon the title as registered, without going behind it 
  to examine the conveyance, are, therefore, the hallmarks of the land titles 
  system. The transmogrification of a vesting order into a conveyance upon registration 
  is consistent with these hallmarks. It does not mean that such an order, once 
  registered on title, is absolutely immune from attack. It simply means that 
  any such attack must be made within the parameters of the Land Titles Act. </p>
<p> [44] That legislation does present a scheme of remedies in circumstances where 
  there has been a wrongful entry on the registry by reason of fraud or of misdescription 
  or because of other errors of certification of title or entry on the registry. 
  The remedies take the form of damages or compensation from the assurance fund 
  established under the Act or, in some instances, rectification of the register 
  by the Director of Titles and/or the court: see, for example, s. 57 (Claims 
  against the Fund), Part IX (Fraud) and Part X (Rectification). In this scheme, 
  good faith purchasers or mortgagees who have taken an interest in the land for 
  valuable consideration and in reliance on the register, are protected,<a href="#a">[4]</a><a name="4"></a> 
  in keeping with the motivating principles underlying the land titles system. 
  It has been held that there is no jurisdiction to rectify the register if to 
  do so would interfere with the registered interest of a bona fide purchaser 
  for value in the interest as registered: see R.A. &amp; J. Family Investment 
  Corp. v. Orzech (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 385 (C.A.); and Durrani v. Augier, supra, 
  at paras. 49, 75 and 76. </p>
<p>
  [45] Vesting orders properly registered on title, then - like other conveyances 
  - are not immune from attack. However, any such attack is limited to the remedies 
  provided under the Land Titles Act and no longer may lie by way of appeal from 
  the original decision granting the vesting order. Title has effectively been 
  changed and innocent third parties are entitled to rely upon that change. The 
  effect of the vesting order qua order has been spent.</p>
<p>
  [46] Johnstone J., of the Alberta Court of Queens Bench, came to a similar conclusion 
  - although not based upon the same reasoning - in Royal Trust Corp. of Canada 
  v. Karenmax Investments (1998), 71 Alta L.R. (3d) 307. She refused to interfere 
  with a vesting order granted by the master in the context of a receivership 
  sale, stating (at para. 22, as amended): </p>
<p class="indent">
  Accordingly, because the Order of Master Funduk has been entered, and no stay 
  of execution was sought nor granted, the Order acts as a transfer of title, 
  which having been registered at the Land Titles Office, extinguishes my ability 
  to set aside the Order, absent any err [sic] in fact or law by the learned Master. 
  &#133;.</p>
<p>
  [47] In a brief three-paragraph endorsement this court granted an unopposed 
  motion to quash an appeal from an order approving a sale by a receiver in National 
  Life Assurance Co. of Canada v. Bruce Steel Manner Ltd., [1999] O.J. No. 1175 
  (C.A.). While a vesting order was involved, it does not appear to have been 
  the subject of the appeal. The appeal was quashed. The sale order had been made 
  in May 1996, a motion to stay the order pending appeal had been dismissed in 
  August, and the sale had closed and a vesting order had been granted in November 
  of that year. The proceeds of sale had been distributed. "Against this 
  background", Catzman J.A. noted, "we agree with [the] submission that 
  the order under appeal is spent".</p>
<p>
  [48] This decision was based on the global situation before the court, not on 
  the narrower premise that the vesting order had been registered and the appeal 
  was therefore moot. I am satisfied, based on the foregoing analysis, however, 
  that the narrower premise is sound.</p>
<p>
  [49] I do not mean to suggest by this analysis that a litigant's legitimate 
  rights of appeal from a vesting order should be prejudiced simply because the 
  successful party is able to run to the land titles office and register faster 
  than the losing party can run to the appeal court, file a notice of appeal and 
  a stay motion and obtain a stay. These matters ought not to be determined on 
  the basis that "the race is to the swiftest". However, there is no 
  automatic stay of such an order in this province, and a losing party might be 
  well advised to seek a stay pending appeal from the judge granting the order, 
  or at least seek terms that would enable a speedy but proper appeal and motion 
  for a stay to be launched. Whether the provisions of s. 57 of the Land Titles 
  Act (Remedy of person wrongfully deprived of land), or the rules of professional 
  conduct, would provide a remedy in situations where a successful party registers 
  a vesting order immediately and in the face of knowledge that the unsuccessful 
  party is launching an appeal and seeking a timely stay, is something that will 
  require consideration should the occasion arise. It may be that the appropriate 
  authorities should consider whether the Act should be amended to bring its provisions 
  in line with those contained in the Alberta legislation, and referred to in 
  footnote 2 above.</p>
<p>
  [50] The foregoing concerns do not change the legal analysis of the effect of 
  registration of a vesting order outlined above, however, and I conclude that 
  the appeal from the vesting order is moot.</p>
<p>
  The Appeals on the Merits</p>
<p>
  [51] Even if I am in error respecting the mootness of the appeal from the vesting 
  order, the appeal from it and from the approval orders must be dismissed on 
  their merits. On behalf of Regal Pacific, Mr. Rueter highlights the facts concerning 
  the Orenstein Group's involvement in the failed $45 million share purchase transaction, 
  which was followed by the receivership, the sudden withdrawal by HIG (also an 
  Orenstein company) of its $31 million bid on September 2, 2003 - just the day 
  before the First 203 Offer for $25 million was submitted - and the involvement 
  of the Orenstein Group in that First (and subsequent) 203 Offer. He forcefully 
  argues that the Orenstein participation in the 203 Offers should have been disclosed 
  to Regal Pacific and to Sachs J., and submits that had that disclosure been 
  made Sachs J. may have declined to approve the Second 203 Offer. The non-disclosure 
  tainted the receivership sale process to the extent that its fairness and integrity 
  have been jeopardized, he concludes, and accordingly the sale must be set aside.</p>
<p>
  [52] On behalf of the receiver, Mr. Casey acknowledges that the Orenstein involvement 
  was not disclosed, even after the receiver became aware of it (which, he submits, 
  was not until the time of the Second 203 Offer). He concedes that "it would 
  have been nice" if the receiver had disclosed the information, but submits 
  it was under no legal obligation to do so as, in its view, the information was 
  not material to the sale process. The sale process was carried out in good faith 
  in accordance with the duties and obligations of the receiver, and both of the 
  203 Offers represented the best offers available at the time of their acceptance 
  - and, in the case of the Second 203 Offer, the only offer available. The transaction 
  is in the best interests of all concerned, he contends. The orders should not 
  be set aside.</p>
<p>
  [53] 203 and the intervenor, Aareal Bank A.G., support the receiver's position. 
  On behalf of 203 Mr. Gilbert argues in addition that 203 is a bona fide purchaser 
  of the hotel for value, that it has paid its deposit and purchase price and 
  registered its interest through the vesting order on title, and that $20 million 
  has been advanced by Aareal Bank A.G. on the strength of the registered vesting 
  order. The transaction cannot be overturned because once the vesting order has 
  been registered it is spent and any appeal from the order is therefore moot. 
  Mr. Dube advanced a similar argument on behalf of Aareal Bank A.G. </p>
<p>
  [54] I do not accept the argument advanced by the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [55] In my view, the fact that the Orenstein Group is involved in the 203 bid 
  is not material to the sale process conducted by the receiver. I agree with 
  the conclusions of Farley J., recited above, in that regard.</p>
<p>
  [56] Whatever may be the rights and obligations between Regal Pacific and the 
  Orenstein Group with respect to the $45 million share purchase transaction, 
  as determined in the pending litigation between them, the facts relating to 
  that transaction are of little more than historical interest in the context 
  of the receivership sale. The hotel was not bankrupt and in receivership, or 
  closed, at that time. For the various reasons outlined earlier, the hotel is 
  an asset progressively declining in value, and it is not surprising that the 
  business may have attracted a higher offer in mid-2002 than it did in mid-2003. 
  Moreover, the $45 million transaction involved the purchase of the shares of 
  Regal Pacific rather than the assets of the hotel and, as well, the acquisition 
  of certain other assets. None of the thirteen bids elicited by the receiver 
  remotely approached a purchase price of $45 million. Apart from its indication 
  that the Orenstein Group has an interest in acquiring the hotel, I do not see 
  the significance of this earlier transaction to the sale process conducted by 
  the receiver.</p>
<p>
  [57] I turn, then, to the $31 million HIG bid. It, too, confirms an interest 
  by the Orenstein Group in the Hotel. Mr. Rueter argues that the withdrawal of 
  that bid the day before the First 203 Offer was presented at the lower $25 million 
  price is suspicious, and that the court should have been apprised of what exchange 
  of information occurred between the receiver, HIG and 203 that resulted in the 
  HIG bid being withdrawn and the lower 203 offer going forward as the offer recommended 
  by the receiver. In my view, however, this argument does not assist Regal Pacific.</p>
<p>
  [58] First, there is not a scintilla of evidence to suggest that the receiver 
  participated in any such discussions. Secondly, when the receiver inquired whether 
  the deposit cheque that had been submitted with the HIG offer - and which had 
  not been certified, as required by the court-approved bidding process - could 
  be cashed, the receiver was told the cheque would not be honoured if presented 
  for payment. The receiver would have been derelict in its duties if it had accepted 
  the HIG bid in those circumstances. Finally, in the absence of some provision 
  in an offer or the terms of the bidding process to the contrary - which was 
  not the case here - a potential purchaser is entitled to withdraw its offer 
  at any time prior to acceptance for any reason, including the belief that the 
  purchaser may be able to obtain the property at a better price by another means. 
  Mr. Rueter conceded that the receiver was not obliged to accept the HIG offer 
  and that he was not asserting a kind of improvident-sale claim for damages based 
  upon the difference in price between the HIG offer and the 203 bid.</p>
<p>
  [59] The stark reality is that after nearly two years of marketing efforts by 
  Colliers, and latterly by Colliers and the receiver, there were no other offers 
  available to the receiver that were superior to the unconditional $25 million 
  First 203 Offer at the time of its acceptance by the receiver and approval by 
  the court. After the failure of the First 203 Offer to close, and in spite of 
  renewed efforts by both Colliers and the receiver, there were no other offers 
  available apart from the $24 million Second 203 Offer, which was accepted by 
  the receiver and approved by Sachs J. </p>
<p>
  [60] A persuasive measure of the realistic nature of the 203 offers is the fact 
  that they are supported by HSBC, which stands to incur a shortfall on its security 
  of $9 million. In addition, there are outstanding unsecured creditors with over 
  $2 million in claims. No one except Regal Pacific has opposed the sale. </p>
<p>
  [61] There is simply nothing on the record to suggest that the hotel assets 
  are likely to fetch a price that will come anywhere close to providing any recovery 
  for Regal Pacific in its capacity as shareholder of the hotel. Regal Pacific, 
  therefore, has little, if anything, to gain from re-opening the sale process. 
  Apart from a liability to make some interest payments as part of an earlier 
  agreement in the proceedings, Regal Pacific is not liable under any guarantees 
  for the indebtedness of the hotel. It therefore has little, if anything to lose 
  from opposing the sale, as well. This lends some credence to the respondents' 
  argument that Regal Pacific's opposition to the sale, and this appeal, are driven 
  by tactical motives extraneous to these proceedings and relating to the separate 
  litigation between it and the Orenstein Group concerning the aborted $45 million 
  share purchase transaction.</p>
<p>
  [62] In the circumstances of this case, then, and given the principles courts 
  must apply when reviewing a sale by a court-appointed receiver, as outlined 
  above, I can find no error on the part of Sachs J. or Farley J. in the exercise 
  of their discretion when granting the orders under appeal. </p>
<p>
  [63] I would dismiss the appeals for the foregoing reasons.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  The Appeals</p>
<p> [64] For all of the foregoing reasons, the appeal from the vesting order granted 
  by Sachs J. is quashed, and the appeals from the orders of Sachs J. dated December 
  19, 2003 approving the sale, and the order of Farley J. dated January 14, 2004, 
  are dismissed.</p>
<p>
  Costs</p>
<p>
  [65] The respondents and the intervenor are entitled to their costs of the appeal, 
  including the motion to quash, which was included in the argument of the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [66] The receiver and 203 requested that costs be fixed on a substantial indemnity 
  basis - the receiver on the ground that the allegations raised impugned its 
  integrity in the conduct of the receivership, and 203 on the ground that the 
  appeal was futile and brought solely for tactical purposes in an attempt to 
  extract a settlement and at great expense to 203 in terms of uncertainty and 
  carrying costs. I would not accede to these requests. Without in any way questioning 
  the integrity of the receiver in the conduct of the receivership, it seems to 
  me that some of the problems could have been avoided had the receiver revealed 
  the involvement of the Orenstein Group in the 203 transactions when it first 
  learned that was the case. While I understand 203's frustration at the delay 
  in finalizing the results of the transaction, it cannot be said that the appeal 
  was frivolous and there is nothing in the circumstances to justify an award 
  of costs on the higher scale: see Foulis v. Robinson (1979), 21 O.R. (2d) 769 
  (C.A.). I would therefore award costs on a partial indemnity scale.</p>
<p>
  [67] Counsel provided us with bills of costs. Regal Constellation sought $57,123.25 
  on a partial indemnity basis if successful. The receiver asks for $61,919.00 
  and Aareal Bank requests $12,224.75. These amounts are inclusive of fees, disbursements 
  and GST and seem somewhat high to me. The draft bill submitted by 203 appears 
  to me to be exceedingly high, given the amounts sought by other parties who 
  carried a similar burden, and notwithstanding the importance of the case for 
  203. 203 asks us to fix its costs in the amount of $137,444.68. Such an award 
  is not justified and would simply not be fair and reasonable in the circumstances, 
  in my view, given the nature and length of the appeal and the issues involved: 
  see Boucher v. Public Accounts Council for the Province of Ontario, [2004] O.J. 
  No. 2634. </p>
<p>
  [68] Costs are awarded, on a partial indemnity basis, as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> a) To the receiver, in that amount of $40,000;</p>
<p class="indent">b) To 203, in the amount of $40,000; and, </p>
<p class="indent">c) To Aareal Bank, in the amount of $12,225.</p>
<p>
  [69] These amounts are inclusive of fees, disbursements and GST.</p>
