<p>On appeal from the conviction and sentence imposed by Justice M. Lack of the 
  Superior Court of Justice dated October 19, 2001 and March 4, 2002.</p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of sexual interference and sentenced to eight 
  months in jail to be followed by two years probation. He appeals conviction 
  and sentence.</p>
<p>[2] Counsel advanced one ground of appeal in the conviction appeal. He argued 
  that the trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to elicit the content of several 
  prior consistent statements made by the complainant to others. The Crown elicited 
  these prior consistent statements during the re-examination of the complainant, 
  on the cross-examination of certain defence witnesses and in reply from a witness 
  called by the Crown specifically for the purpose of eliciting a prior consistent 
  statement.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant had challenged the credibility of the complainant during 
  cross-examination. Certain prior inconsistent statements were put to the complainant 
  and it was also established on cross-examination that she had denied being assaulted 
  by the appellant when first asked by her mother.</p>
<p>[4] The Crown argued that the cross-examination opened the evidentiary door 
  to evidence of all prior consistent statements made by the complainant. The 
  trial judge appears to have accepted this submission. She did, however, add 
  this caveat:</p>
<p class="indent">The real crux of the issue is the use I put to the evidence that I hear of 
  prior consistent statements, if that is what comes out in this witness&#146; 
  evidence. The Crown tells me it will. So since it is the use that I will be 
  putting to those statements, that can also be dealt with again in submissions. 
  I am capable of hearing something and then instructing myself at a later time 
  that I cannot use it for a purpose or I can it for a purpose.</p>
<p>[5] We cannot agree that cross-examination on the alleged inconsistencies rendered 
  admissible the contents of all prior consistent statements made by the complainant. 
  Where evidence of a prior consistent statement is offered to support credibility, 
  the trial judge must decide whether in all of the circumstances, evidence that 
  the witness made the prior consistent statement could assist the trier of fact 
  in making an accurate assessment of the witness&#146; credibility by removing 
  potential mistaken impressions based on an incomplete picture of what the complainant 
  had said or not said about the relevant events on other occasions. The trial 
  judge must make this determination bearing in mind that normally the mere fact 
  that a witness has made prior consistent statements is of no assistance in determining 
  the credibility of that witness. The trial judge must also consider whether 
  the admission of the prior consistent statement would unfairly prejudice the 
  accused or unduly prolong or complicate the proceedings. Finally, the trial 
  judge must decide, if he or she determines that evidence of the prior statement 
  should be admitted, whether it is appropriate to admit all or part of the contents 
  of the prior statement or to only allow counsel to lead evidence that a consistent 
  statement was made on the prior occasion.</p>
<p>[6] In the present case, the cross-examination on alleged inconsistencies in 
  prior statements by the complainant did not justify adducing evidence of the 
  content of all of the prior consistent statements made by the complainant. For 
  example, we think the admission in reply of a prior consistent statement was 
  wrong. It was also wrong in the circumstances of this case to permit evidence 
  of prior consistent statements where no part of those statements had been the 
  subject of cross-examination.</p>
<p>[7] We are satisfied, however, that the appellant suffered no prejudice as 
  a result of the improper admission of some of the prior consistent statements. 
  The trial judge made no reference to the prior consistent statements in her 
  reasons. She considered the alleged prior inconsistent statements in assessing 
  the complainant&#146;s credibility and resolved the alleged inconsistencies 
  in favour of the complainant by reference to matters other than the prior consistent 
  statements.</p>
<p>[8] In the final analysis, the trial judge viewed the evidence of the conversation 
  between the complainant and the appellant&#146;s daughter immediately after 
  the alleged assault and the evidence concerning the complainant&#146;s attendance 
  at the eleventh birthday party of the appellant&#146;s daughter as the two key 
  factual issues at trial. The trial judge&#146;s analysis of the evidence relating 
  to those issues, reveals a full and accurate appreciation of the evidence and 
  was not dependent upon the evidence of the prior consistent statements. The 
  trial judge&#146;s reasoning on these issues is compelling.</p>
<p>[9] The appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
<p>[10] With respect to the sentence appeal, we are satisfied that the trial judge 
  made two errors in principle. First, she found that the fact that the complainant 
  was required to testify on the preliminary and at trial was an aggravating factor. 
  The fact that the appellant pleaded not guilty and took advantage of the statutory 
  right to a preliminary inquiry and a trial cannot be aggravating factors.</p>
<p>[11] The second error in principle is the trial judge&#146;s finding that there 
  was a risk that the appellant would re-offend. The trial judge did not refer 
  to any evidence to support this finding. The offence involved the touching of 
  a ten-year-old child who was sleeping over with the appellant&#146;s daughter. 
  The offence apparently occurred in 1996. The appellant was charged in 1999 and 
  sentenced in March 2002. Aside from serving fourteen days of the sentence, the 
  appellant has been on bail since 1999, without incident. The appellant had a 
  minor record in 1990 for simple assault and assault with intent to resist arrest. 
  The pre-sentence report indicates that people who know the appellant considered 
  this offence to be out of character. The appellant is now 53 years of age and 
  self-employed. There is nothing in his background or in the pre-sentence report 
  to suggest that he would re-offend.</p>
<p>[12] In the circumstances, particularly taking into account the time served, 
  the time that has passed since the offence occurred and charges were laid and 
  the appellant&#146;s conduct since he was charged, we conclude that a conditional 
  sentence would be an appropriate disposition. The appellant will be sentenced 
  to a term of fifteen months imprisonment to be served in the community on the 
  conditions to be set out in the draft order. Those conditions will include a 
  curfew and a substantial community service requirement. The probation order 
  imposed by the trial judge will remain in effect.</p>
