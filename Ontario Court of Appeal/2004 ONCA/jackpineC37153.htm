<p>On appeal from the orders of Justice R. Trainor of the Ontario Court (Gen. 
  Div.), dated September 25, 2001 dismissing applications wherein the appellants 
  sought to quash authorizations for the taking of bodily substances for forensic 
  DNA analysis made by Justice Glaude of the Ontario Court of Justice on December 
  4, 2000 (re Rodgers) and February 28, 2001 (re Jackpine).</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [1] The Crown brought two ex parte applications under s. 487.055(1) of the Criminal 
  Code seeking orders authorizing the taking of bodily substances from the appellants 
  for forensic DNA analysis. Section 487.055 is part of the DNA databank scheme 
  set out in the Criminal Code. That scheme allows the Crown to obtain DNA samples 
  from certain categories of convicted persons. The samples are analyzed for the 
  purpose of obtaining a DNA profile which is stored in the national DNA databank.</p>
<p>
  [2] Justice Glaude of the Ontario Court of Justice granted the authorizations. 
  The appellants, who were on parole, were each served with a summons directing 
  them to attend at the police station on the specified date to give the required 
  samples. </p>
<p> [3] Prior to the return date on the summons, the appellants retained counsel 
  and brought motions to quash the authorizations and to prohibit the taking of 
  the samples. Since the applications raised similar issues, they were argued 
  together before Trainor J. The appellants contended that the relevant statutory 
  provisions were unconstitutional. In the alternative, they argued that Justice 
  Glaude had lost jurisdiction by proceeding ex parte on the applications. The 
  late Justice Trainor dismissed the motions to quash and to prohibit. The appellants 
  appeal from that dismissal.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> </p>
<p> [4] On the appeals, the appellants renewed their challenge to the constitutionality 
  of s. 487.055 arguing that it infringed ss. 7, 8 and 11(i) of the Charter. The 
  appellants also argued that even if the legislation was constitutional, Trainor 
  J. erred in holding that the court had not lost jurisdiction when it heard the 
  applications ex parte. </p>
<p>
  [5] Counsel for the appellant Jackpine also contends that the order of Glaude 
  J. should have been quashed on the basis of a reasonable apprehension of bias. 
  In advancing this argument, counsel relies on the fact that the reasons for 
  granting the authorization signed by Glaude J. were drafted by the Crown prior 
  to the application.</p>
<p>
  [6] I would reject the constitutional arguments and the appellant, Jackpine's 
  bias claim. I would, however, give effect to the argument that Trainor J. erred 
  in holding that Glaude J. had not lost jurisdiction by proceeding with the applications 
  ex parte. As I read the legislation, the court can hear an application under 
  s. 487.055(1) on an ex parte basis, where the Crown demonstrates the need to 
  proceed ex parte. The material filed by the Crown on the applications before 
  Glaude J. did not address the need to proceed ex parte. Consequently, there 
  was no basis upon which Glaude J., acting judicially, could conclude that it 
  was appropriate to proceed on an ex parte basis. He lost jurisdiction by doing 
  so.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>
  [7] DNA evidence has become a mainstay in the investigation and prosecution 
  of serious crimes. The power of DNA evidence to convict the guilty and free 
  the innocent can hardly be overstated. DNA evidence is without question, the 
  most important forensic development since fingerprint comparison evidence came 
  into use. At the same time, government seizure and use of personal DNA samples 
  has profound implications on personal privacy and the individual security of 
  the person. </p>
<p>
  [8] Parliament has moved to make DNA evidence available to those investigating 
  crime and at the same time to protect legitimate individual privacy interests. 
  In 1995, DNA search warrant legislation came into effect. A DNA search warrant 
  allows the police to obtain bodily substances for DNA analysis from individuals 
  suspected to have committed specified offences. The DNA warrant provisions found 
  in s. 487.05 to s. 487.09 of the Criminal Code are similar to, but somewhat 
  more stringent than, the provisions relating to traditional search warrants. 
  Those provisions are not in issue on these appeals. Their constitutionality 
  was recently upheld in the Supreme Court of Canada: see R. v. B.(S.A.) (2003), 
  178 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [9] On June 30, 2000, the DNA Identification Act, S.C. 1998, c. 37 (the "Act") 
  came into force. Section 3 identified the purpose of the Act: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The purpose of this Act is to establish a national DNA databank to help law 
  enforcement agencies identify persons alleged to have committed designated offences, 
  including those committed before the coming into force of this Act.</p>
<p>
  [10] Section 4 of the Act sets out the principles governing the Act. These include 
  the protection of society and the administration of justice through the early 
  detection, arrest and conviction of offenders, the use of DNA profiles for law 
  enforcement purposes identified in the Act, and the protection of the privacy 
  of individuals and their personal information. </p>
<p>
  [11] It is unnecessary to describe the taking of DNA samples for databank purposes 
  or the operation of the databank in any detail. A helpful summary of the provisions 
  and the process can be found in R. v. Briggs (2001), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 38 at 48-54 
  (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 31. It is 
  sufficient for present purposes to note that the Criminal Code provides for 
  judicial orders authorizing the collection of DNA samples from certain convicted 
  persons. The samples are collected for the purpose of an analysis which yields 
  a DNA profile. That profile is stored in the convicted offender's index of the 
  DNA databank. Profiles in that index can be compared with DNA profiles obtained 
  by the analysis of substances found at unsolved crime scenes and stored in the 
  crime scenes index of the DNA databank. If a DNA profile from a convicted offender 
  matches a DNA profile from a substance taken from a crime scene, this match 
  can be used as the basis for obtaining a DNA warrant authorizing the taking 
  of a bodily sample from the individual whose DNA profile matched the profile 
  from the substance taken from the crime scene. </p>
<p>
  [12] As of October 2003, law enforcement agencies had found some 1,100 matches 
  between DNA profiles kept in the convicted offenders index and DNA profiles 
  kept in the crime scenes index. </p>
<p> [13] The Criminal Code identifies three categories of offenders who may be 
  required to provide a DNA sample for DNA databank purposes following conviction: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>persons who committed a designated offence as defined in s. 487.04 after 
    the proclamation of the DNA Identification Act in June 2000 (s. 487.051);</li>
  <li>persons who committed a designated offence prior to the proclamation of 
    the DNA Identification Act, but were still before the trial court when the 
    Act was proclaimed (s. 487.052; R. v. Hendry (2001), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 275 at 
    286 (Ont. C.A.)); and</li>
  <li>certain identified offenders who were convicted and sentenced prior to the 
    proclamation of the DNA Identification Act (s. 487.055).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [14] Although both appellants fall into the third category, a brief description 
  of the first two categories is necessary. Offenders who fall into the first 
  category committed a designated offence after the proclamation of the Act. Designated 
  offences are identified in s. 487.04 and are divided into primary designated 
  offences and secondary designated offences. Both subcategories are also set 
  out in s. 487.04. Broadly speaking, primary designated offences are the most 
  serious offences in the criminal law and secondary designated offences, while 
  still serious, are somewhat less serious than those classified as primary designated 
  offences. If an accused is convicted of a primary designated offence committed 
  after the proclamation of the Act and the Crown brings a DNA databank application, 
  the judge must order the taking of a sample for DNA databank purposes subject 
  to the limited discretion to decline the order if the offender establishes that 
  the impact on his or her privacy and security of the person would be grossly 
  disproportionate to the public interest in the protection of society and the 
  proper administration of justice: s. 487.051(1)(a), s. 487.051(2). </p>
<p>
  [15] If the offender has been convicted of a secondary designated offence committed 
  after the proclamation of the Act and the Crown applies for a DNA databank order, 
  the judge must, according to s. 487.051(b), determine whether he or she is satisfied 
  that the making of the order is in the best interests of the administration 
  of justice. In exercising that discretion, the judge must consider, among other 
  relevant factors, those factors identified in s. 487.051(3). </p>
<p>
  [16] When the DNA databank order is sought against the second category of offender, 
  persons who were charged with a designated offence committed before the Act 
  came into force but were still before the trial court when the Act was proclaimed, 
  the court must determine whether the making of the order is in the best interests 
  of the administration of justice. Section 487.052(2) directs the judge to consider 
  the same factors outlined in s. 487.051(3). In the case of these offenders, 
  there is no distinction made between primary designated offences and secondary 
  designated offences.</p>
<p>
  [17] Applications for DNA databank orders in respect of the first and second 
  categories of offenders are made at the time of sentence. The offender is normally 
  present and entitled to make submissions on the application. Section 487.054 
  gives offenders in the first two categories and the Crown a right of appeal 
  from the disposition of the DNA databank application.</p>
<p> [18] Unlike the first two categories of offenders, those who fall into the 
  third category are not before the courts when the application is brought. They 
  have been convicted and sentenced. This third category, sometimes referred to 
  as retroactive offenders, has a much more limited application than either of 
  the first two categories. It reaches only: </p>
<ul>
  <li>persons declared dangerous offenders;</li>
  <li>some multiple murderers; and</li>
  <li>repeat sex offenders who are serving a penitentiary sentence for a sexual 
    offence when the application is brought.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [19] Section 487.055(1) reads: </p>
<p class="indent"> 487.055(1) A provincial court judge may, on ex parte application 
  made in Form 5.05, authorize, in Form 5.06, the taking, from a person who</p>
<p class="indent">(a) before the coming into force of this subsection, had been 
  declared a dangerous offender under Part XXIV,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) before the coming into force of this subsection, had been 
  convicted of more than one murder committed at different times, or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) before the coming into force of this subsection, had been 
  convicted of more than one sexual offence within the meaning of subsection (3) 
  and, on the date of the application, is serving a sentence of imprisonment of 
  at least two years for one or more of those offences,</p>
<p class="indent">for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis, of any number of samples 
  of one or more bodily substances that is reasonably required for that purpose, 
  by means of the investigative procedures described in subsection 487.06(1).<a href="#1">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [20] As with all other databank orders, the judge has a discretion as to whether 
  to make the DNA databank order sought under s. 487.055(1). Section 487.055(3.1) 
  identifies the factors which must be taken into consideration by the judge. 
  If the court decides to authorize the taking of a sample and the offender is 
  on conditional release, a summons is issued directing the person to attend at 
  the place, date and time identified for the purpose of providing the sample 
  (s. 487.055(4)). If he fails to appear, a warrant may issue (s. 487.055(8)). 
  </p>
<p>
  [21] Both appellants are repeat sexual offenders and fall under s. 487.055(1)(c). 
  Jackpine was convicted of sexual assault in March 1999 and received a sentence 
  of three years. He was serving that sentence, albeit on parole, when this application 
  was brought against him. Jackpine had previous convictions for sexual assault 
  in 1997 and 1993. Rodgers was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to four 
  years in February 1997. He was serving that sentence, also on parole, when this 
  application was brought against him. Rodgers had previously been convicted of 
  sexual interference in August 1993. </p>
<p>
  [22] As both appellants were on parole when the taking of the DNA samples was 
  authorized, they were summonsed to attend at a local police station to provide 
  the necessary samples. The summonses were returnable about three weeks after 
  the order was made. It is not clear when they were served, although it would 
  appear to have been well before the date on which they were to attend to provide 
  the sample. The terms of the authorizations provided that the appellants were 
  to be afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel. </p>
<p>III</p>
<p>
  Constitutional Arguments</p>
<p>
  [23] The appellants contend that s. 487.055(1) infringes s. 8 of the Charter 
  in that it permits the seizing of bodily samples for the purpose of DNA analysis 
  without the state first establishing that an offence was probably committed 
  and that the sample will probably afford evidence in connection with that offence. 
  In making this submission, counsel equate the taking of a DNA sample for databank 
  purposes from convicted persons with the taking of a DNA sample pursuant to 
  a DNA warrant from a suspect. </p>
<p>
  [24] Counsel acknowledge that this court rejected this argument in R. v. Briggs, 
  supra, at pp. 53-59, where the constitutionality of s. 487.052 was challenged. 
  Counsel accept that the analysis in Briggs has equal application to s. 487.055. 
  We see no reason to reconsider Briggs, supra. In our view, it was correctly 
  decided. Indeed, counsel did not suggest that we should reconsider Briggs, but 
  advanced this argument to "preserve potential further appellate rights".</p>
<p>
  [25] Counsel for Jackpine, but not counsel for Rodgers, also submitted that 
  s. 487.055(1) contravenes s. 8 of the Charter because it does not articulate 
  a standard according to which the court should exercise its discretion in determining 
  whether to authorize the taking of a DNA sample for databank purposes. Counsel 
  submits that while s. 487.055(3.1) identifies factors to be considered by the 
  judge in exercising his or her discretion, there is no articulated standard 
  by which the competing interests of the individual and the State are to be measured. 
  Counsel contends that in this respect, offenders subject to s. 487.055(1) are 
  treated differently than offenders subject to the taking of DNA samples for 
  databank purposes under the other provisions in the Criminal Code. Those provisions 
  require that the competing interests be balanced on a best interests of the 
  administration of justice scale. </p>
<p> [26] The factors which a judge must consider in determining whether to make 
  a DNA databank order under s. 487.055(1) are set out in s. 487.055(3.1). They 
  are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the offender's criminal record;</li>
  <li>the nature of the offence;</li>
  <li>the circumstances of the offence; and</li>
  <li>the impact of the order on the offender's privacy and security of the person.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [27] These are the same factors which must be considered in determining whether 
  to make DNA databank orders for offenders falling under the other two categories 
  described in the Act: Criminal Code s. 487.051(3), s. 487.052(2). These factors 
  considered in combination with the stated purpose (s. 3) and principles (s. 
  4) of the Act implicitly impose a best interests of the administration of justice 
  standard into s. 487.055. Recognizing that a best interests of the administration 
  of justice standard is implicit in s. 487.055 also renders it consistent with 
  the other provisions relating to DNA databank orders. Counsel for Rodgers accepts 
  this interpretation. The best interests of the administration of justice standard 
  was held to be constitutional in R. v. Briggs, supra, at pp. 63-64. We agree 
  with that finding.</p>
<p>
  [28] Both appellants next argue that an order requiring them to provide a sample 
  for DNA databank purposes contravenes s. 11(i) of the Charter. That section 
  provides that where the punishment for an offence has been altered between the 
  time of the commission of the offence and the time of sentencing, the offender 
  is entitled to the benefit of the lesser punishment. The appellants argue that 
  the enactment of a provision providing for the taking of a DNA sample for databank 
  purposes constitutes punishment and that since the provision was not in force 
  when the appellants committed their offences, s. 11(i) forecloses resort to 
  the section against them. The simple answer to this submission is that the taking 
  of the sample is not a punishment anymore than would be the taking of fingerprints 
  or the taking of a photograph of a convicted person: R. v. Briggs, supra, at 
  p. 72; R. v. Murrins (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3rd) 412 at 442-448 (N.S. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [29] Counsel next submit that s. 487.055 offends s. 7 of the Charter by permitting 
  the Crown to bring the application for a DNA databank order ex parte. In advancing 
  this argument, counsel rely on both the individual interests effected by the 
  order made under s. 487.055(1) and the nature of the decision which must be 
  made under that section. Counsel contend that the application puts the liberty 
  and security interests of the offender in jeopardy, thereby necessitating procedures 
  governing the application which are consistent with the principles of fundamental 
  justice. Counsel further submit that the discretion to be exercised under s. 
  487.055 requires an appreciation of both societal interests and competing individual 
  interests. Counsel argue that the latter can only be properly placed before 
  the court if the target of the application is given notice of the application 
  and an opportunity to participate in it. Counsel submits that the nature of 
  the individual rights affected and the nature of the discretion to be exercised 
  define the scope of the procedural protections necessary to comport with the 
  principles of fundamental justice. Counsel argue that the target of the application 
  must receive notice of the application, notice of the material relied on by 
  the Crown and an opportunity to respond to that application. </p>
<p>
  [30] I accept that the appellants' liberty and security interests were placed 
  in jeopardy by the applications brought under s. 487.055(1). If the applications 
  were successful, the appellants would be required to attend at a police station 
  and would be detained there while bodily substances were seized from them. The 
  execution of the procedures authorized under s. 487.055 would clearly infringe 
  the appellants' rights to liberty and to the security of the person. The infringement 
  of those interests requires that the processes governing the application comport 
  with the principles of fundamental justice. </p>
<p>
  [31] Section 487.055(1) begins with the words "a provincial court judge 
  may, on ex parte application". Identical words in s. 487.05, the DNA warrant 
  section, have been interpreted as giving the judge a discretion to proceed ex 
  parte or provide notice to an affected party: R. v. S.F. (2000), 141 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 225 at 244 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. B.(S.A.), supra, at p. 215. The appellants 
  accept that s. 487.055(1) only permits and does not require an ex parte proceeding. 
  They contend that as there are no circumstances under which proceeding ex parte 
  could be justified, the discretion to proceed ex parte contravenes the principles 
  of fundamental justice. </p>
<p>
  [32] The court's power to proceed ex parte with motions or applications brought 
  under the Criminal Code is well-established where the failure to proceed ex 
  parte would frustrate the administration of justice. For example, s. 487(1), 
  authorizes the issuance of search warrants and makes no reference to proceeding 
  ex parte. It is accepted, however, that judges hearing search warrant applications 
  may proceed, and indeed usually will proceed ex parte: R. v. Canadian Broadcasting 
  Corporation (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 757 at 766-68 (C.A.). Section 487.055 expressly 
  contemplates proceeding ex parte. In doing so, it does no more than recognize 
  that a court may, as a matter of controlling the effectiveness of its own process 
  and proceedings, allow an application to proceed without notice where the court 
  is satisfied that notice would frustrate the purpose of the proceeding or render 
  the due administration of justice impracticable: R. v. B.(S.A.), supra, at p. 
  215; A.G. (Nova Scotia) v. McIntyre (1992), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 129 at 147-49 (SCC). 
  The power to proceed ex parte where circumstances warrant is an integral component 
  of the proper administration of justice. That power cannot in and itself run 
  afoul of the principles of fundamental justice. </p>
<p>
  [33] The conclusion that s. 487.055 is not unconstitutional because it permits 
  the judge to proceed ex parte, does not place the manner in which the judge 
  exercises that discretion in an individual case beyond the pale of constitutional 
  review. The judge must exercise that discretion in a manner which is consistent 
  with Charter principles and specifically in a manner which ensures that the 
  individual's right to liberty and security of the person will not be denied 
  except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice: see Little 
  Sisters Books and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice) (2000), 150 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 1 at 53 (SCC).</p>
<p>
  [34] In determining how the procedural discretion described in s. 487.055(1) 
  should be exercised, the court should begin with the general rule that a person 
  whose right to liberty or security of the person may be affected by a court 
  order, is entitled to notice of the application for that order, the material 
  relied on in support of that application and an opportunity to be heard: Ruby 
  v. Canada (Solicitor General), [2002] 4 S.C.R. 1 at 24-25. That general rule, 
  however, admits of exceptions. One exception involves applications for court 
  approval of investigative orders such as search warrants. That kind of application 
  is normally brought ex parte because of the very real risk that the target of 
  the application, if given notice, would take steps to frustrate the investigative 
  process, or flee the jurisdiction: R. v. B.(S.A.), supra, at p. 215. The need 
  to move quickly to seek, obtain and implement court orders referable to investigative 
  procedures can sometimes provide an added reason for proceeding ex parte.</p>
<p>
  [35] The Crown submits that s. 487.055(1) applications fall within the investigative 
  orders exception to the general rule requiring notice to potentially affected 
  parties. The Crown acknowledges that destruction of evidence is not a concern 
  on a DNA databank application, but argues that the risk of flight is a very 
  real concern if the target of a s. 487.055(1) application who is at large, is 
  given advance notice of the application. The Crown contends that in determining 
  how to proceed under s. 487.055(1), the judge should presume that the proceeding 
  will be ex parte subject to the exercise of his or her discretion in favour 
  of giving notice to the target of the application.</p>
<p>
  [36] I reject the Crown's attempt to equate applications under s. 487.055(1) 
  with applications for search warrants. Where a search warrant is sought, the 
  police have reasonable and probable grounds to suspect that an individual has 
  committed a specific crime and that the search warrant will produce evidence 
  against that individual of that crime. Where a DNA databank order is sought 
  under s. 487.055(1), the police have no reason to suspect that the target of 
  the application has committed any crime or that the sample will connect the 
  target of the application to any crime. Search warrants and wiretaps focus on 
  individuals and specific past or ongoing crimes. Targets of search warrants 
  and wiretaps know that the police are on their trail. DNA databank applications 
  are not aimed at assisting in the investigation of any individual or any specific 
  crime. Rather, they are a means of providing law enforcement agencies with a 
  resource in the form of DNA profiles that may some day assist in solving a past 
  or future crime. No doubt, some individuals who are served with notice of a 
  DNA databank application might flee the jurisdiction. I do not think, however, 
  that the same assumption about flight made with respect to targets of search 
  warrants and wiretaps can be made about individuals who are subject to a s. 
  487.055(1) application. </p>
<p>
  [37] Section 487.055(4) is also inconsistent with the Crown's claim that the 
  risk of flight by those subject to a s. 487.055(1) application is so real as 
  to justify a presumptively ex parte proceeding. Section 487.055(4) provides 
  that a person on parole who is subject to an order under s. 487.055(1) shall 
  be summonsed to attend at an appropriate place to give the required sample. 
  The use of a summons is inconsistent with a presumption that those subject to 
  s. 487.055(1) should be presumed to be flight risks if given notice of the application 
  itself. </p>
<p>
  [38] The Crown attempted to blunt the negative effect of s. 487.055(4) on their 
  contention that the application should be presumptively ex parte by describing 
  a process whereby the summons could demand the immediate attendance of the target 
  of the application at the time and place set out in the summons, thereby allowing 
  the officer serving the summons to require the individual to go with the officer 
  to the place where the sample was to be taken. Without deciding whether the 
  section contemplates a process whereby a summons becomes a de facto warrant, 
  it is obvious that the process outlined by the Crown is not the process that 
  was followed. Both appellants received their summonses well before the date 
  on which they were to attend to provide samples. </p>
<p>
  [39] The Crown's submission that s. 487.055(1) applications should be presumptively 
  ex parte is also inconsistent with the other provisions dealing with DNA databank 
  orders. Individuals who fall into the other two categories of offenders who 
  may be required to provide a DNA databank sample are entitled to be present 
  when the application is made and have a right of appeal. For these offenders, 
  the DNA databank application is part of the sentencing process. The only distinction 
  between these two categories and offenders caught by s. 487.055(1) is that the 
  latter are no longer before the courts. No doubt, because offenders in the first 
  two categories are returning to the court for sentencing, it is administratively 
  easier to provide those offenders with notice and to permit their participation 
  in the application for a DNA databank order.</p>
<p>
  [40] I reject, however, any assertion that administrative efficiency or the 
  mere inconvenience associated with providing notice can justify a presumption 
  in favour of proceeding ex parte. It is always easier to proceed without notice 
  to the party who may wish to oppose the application.</p>
<p>
  [41] The Crown also argued that applications under s. 487.055(1) should be treated 
  as presumptively ex parte because in the vast majority of applications notice 
  would serve no real purpose. The Crown submits that s. 487.055 is narrowly tailored 
  to reach only a small group of persons: dangerous offenders, multiple murderers, 
  and repeat sex offenders who are still serving a penitentiary sentence. Crown 
  counsel contends that bearing in mind the limited group of offenders who are 
  caught by this section, and the factors to be considered in deciding whether 
  to make the DNA databank order, it will almost always be made when requested. 
  I take the Crown to argue that notice is not necessary except in exceptional 
  cases because s. 487.055(1) applications will almost inevitably be granted. 
  </p>
<p>
  [42] This submissions fails for two reasons. First, I do not think an individual's 
  right to notice of a proceeding which may affect his or her liberty and security 
  of the person should be tied to that person's ability to successfully resist 
  the application. Procedural due process is afforded without regard to the merits 
  or potential outcome of the proceeding. Second, I cannot accept the premise 
  that the outcome of s. 487.055(1) applications is a foregone conclusion. An 
  order cannot be made unless the preconditions set out in the section are met. 
  Correctional records can be incorrect or incomplete. Even if the records are 
  complete and accurate, it can be unclear as to whether an offender is serving 
  a sentence for a sexual offence when the DNA databank application is brought: 
  e.g. see R. v. Carrignan (2003), 172 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.). If an offender 
  is given notice of the hearing and an opportunity to be heard, he or she may 
  correct errors in the records placed before the court or provide additional 
  information which would be relevant to whether the preconditions to the granting 
  of the order exist. </p>
<p>
  [43] Even if the preconditions of s. 487.055(1) are met, the section requires 
  the judge to exercise a discretion which balances individual and societal concerns 
  on an interests of the administration of justice scale. The existence of that 
  discretion presupposes that there will be cases where the balance will favour 
  the individual and lead to the denial of the application. Even if those cases 
  are in the minority, that is no justification for a presumption that the proceeding 
  should be ex parte. To the contrary, a discretion which requires the balancing 
  of individual rights against societal interests invites the participation on 
  the application of both the individual and the Crown. The nature of the discretion 
  to be exercised points towards the giving of notice, unless notice would defeat 
  the purpose of the application.</p>
<p>
  [44] Finally, the Crown argues that the availability of judicial review by certiorari 
  justifies a presumptively ex parte procedure on the application. I see no merit 
  to this argument. The availability of after-the-fact review of an order can 
  assist in meeting procedural fairness requirements where the order was granted 
  ex parte. The availability of judicial review cannot, however, justify proceeding 
  on an ex parte basis. The availability of certiorari only assists the Crown 
  in demonstrating procedural fairness if it can first justify proceeding without 
  notice. </p>
<p> [45] The discretion granted by s. 487.055(1) to proceed ex parte should be 
  exercised in a manner that is consistent with Charter principles. Those principles 
  require notice to the individual whose liberty and security of the person interests 
  are potentially affected by the order unless the Crown can establish legitimate 
  grounds (e.g. a real risk of flight) for proceeding without notice.<a href="#1">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [46] A judge hearing a s. 487.055(1) application should start from the assumption 
  that the target of the application whose liberty and security of the person 
  will be significantly affected if the order is granted should receive notice 
  of the application. It is open to the Crown to rebut the presumption of notice 
  with evidence that in the particular circumstances, notice could frustrate the 
  process contemplated by s. 487.055. Evidence showing a real risk of flight if 
  notice was given, would clearly justify a decision to proceed ex parte.</p>
<p>
  [47] In holding that notice should generally be given to the subject of the 
  application, I do not mean to suggest that a proceeding under s. 487.055(1) 
  should take on the trappings of a criminal trial. I see no place for the strict 
  application of the rules of evidence, the assigning of burdens of proof or the 
  re-litigation of factual or legal issues decided in previous proceedings involving 
  the offender who is the subject of the application. A summary form of procedure 
  would be appropriate as long as it would allow for the effective exercise of 
  the discretion called for under the section, and would be responsive to the 
  particular issues that arise on the specific application. I would think that 
  in most cases the judge can rely on transcripts from prior proceedings, pre-sentence 
  reports, victim impact statements and criminal records unless the subject of 
  the application, having been given an opportunity to do so, can show cause why 
  the material should not be relied on by the judge. The manner in which the subject 
  of the application can challenge the Crown material should depend on the nature 
  of the challenge and the nature of the material. I do not think that cross-examination 
  will always be necessary to afford the requisite procedural fairness. Procedural 
  matters will have to be worked out on a case-by-case basis. </p>
<p>
  IV</p>
<p>
  The Decision to Proceed Ex Parte in These Cases</p>
<p>
  [48] Trainor J. held that s. 487.055(1) gave the judge a discretion to proceed 
  ex parte but did not foreclose notice in cases where the judge deemed it appropriate. 
  In holding that notice was unnecessary in the appellants' cases, Trainor J. 
  said: </p>
<p class="indent"> The facts of this case illustrate the legislative reasoning 
  in making this section ex parte. Both accused have records. Both were convicted 
  of at least one brutal assault for which lengthy terms of imprisonment were 
  imposed. Both have multiple convictions for failing to appear in court. It is 
  not speculation to think these men may not want to provide DNA. Only they know 
  whether they have anything to fear from DNA identification. The facts before 
  Justice Glaude called out for an ex parte order.</p>
<p class="indent">If the evidence was that either or both of the applicants were 
  in custody and therefore had little opportunity to defeat the application, the 
  judge could and probably would order notice.</p>
<p>
  [49] As Trainor J. indicates, both appellants had convictions for failure to 
  appear, although Rodgers' two convictions for that offence were entered at the 
  same time almost 15 years before the application. The Crown offered no details 
  of any of the failure to appear convictions. Apart from reference to those convictions 
  in the appellants' criminal records, no mention was made of them in the affidavits 
  filed in support of the applications.</p>
<p>
  [50] The mere possibility, unsupported by any material referable to the circumstances 
  of the specific individual, that a target of a s. 487.055(1) application may 
  fear that the sample could connect him to a prior crime cannot justify an inference 
  of flight that is sufficiently strong to warrant proceeding ex parte. On the 
  view Trainor J. took, the only individuals entitled to notice would be those 
  in the penitentiary. The Crown must go further if it seeks to proceed ex parte. 
  The Crown must be able to personalize flight concerns so that the judge has 
  reason to believe, based on the material placed before him or her, that there 
  is a reasonable possibility that this particular offender may attempt to frustrate 
  any DNA databank order that may be made by fleeing the jurisdiction before the 
  application is brought if notice is given to that person.</p>
<p>
  [51] The material before Glaude J. did not address the need to proceed ex parte. 
  Nothing in the affidavit material hinted that either appellant might flee the 
  jurisdiction if made aware of the application. To the contrary, the material 
  disclosed that both appellants were under parole supervision, identified their 
  current address, and indicated that if the application was granted, each appellant 
  would be served with a summons requiring him to attend at the appropriate police 
  station to provide the sample. I think it is obvious from the affidavits that 
  it was intended that the appellants would be given some advance notice of the 
  time and place at which they were to appear to provide the sample. This mode 
  of proceeding is inconsistent with any flight concern. </p>
<p>
  [52] A reading of the material filed on the applications drives me to the conclusion 
  that it was simply assumed that the proceedings before Glaude J. would be ex 
  parte and that there was no need to justify that mode of procedure. The reasons 
  of Glaude J. confirm this assessment. They make no reference to the fact that 
  the applications proceeded ex parte or to any justification for proceeding in 
  that manner. </p>
<p>
  [53] Glaude J. lost jurisdiction when he proceeded ex parte in the absence of 
  any basis in the material which could justify proceeding in that manner. Absent 
  any justification for proceeding ex parte, the failure to give the appellants 
  notice of the applications amounted to a denial of natural justice resulting 
  in a loss of jurisdiction: Re Compton and The Queen (1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 163 
  at 165 (B.C.S.C.).</p>
<p>
  [54] It is no answer to a finding that Glaude J. proceeded without jurisdiction, 
  to argue, as the Crown does, that the orders were properly made. A "correct" 
  result does not cure a loss of jurisdiction. </p>
<p>
  V</p>
<p>
  The Bias Claim</p>
<p>
  [55] Section 487.055(3.1) requires that a judge give reasons for granting a 
  DNA databank order under s. 487.055(1). The Crown routinely provides proposed 
  reasons for judgment in the material provided to judges on ex parte application. 
  For example, on the application pertaining to Jackpine, the Crown provided a 
  draft authorization for the taking of bodily substances for DNA analysis. That 
  draft was in Form 5.06 as provided for in the Criminal Code. Attached as Appendix 
  "B" to the authorization was a document entitled "Reasons for 
  Decisions to Grant the Authorization". The document contained six paragraphs 
  which in generic terms outlined the reasons for granting the authorization against 
  the appellant Jackpine. For example, paragraph 1 read: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This Authorization may help law enforcement agencies to identify Rodney T. Jackpine 
  as a person responsible for the commission of designated offences under the 
  DNA Identification Act, including those that he may have committed prior to 
  the coming into force of the DNA Identification Act.</p>
<p>
  [56] The heading "Other Reasons" followed by a space appears under 
  the six paragraphs described above. In the case of the authorization made against 
  Jackpine, the space was left empty. No additional reasons were give for granting 
  the authorization. The reasons for decision were signed by Glaude J.</p>
<p>
  [57] Counsel for Jackpine submits that the trial judge's unqualified adoption 
  of the reasons prepared in advance by the Crown for granting the authorization 
  creates a reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
<p>
  [58] There is a strong presumption in favour of the impartiality of the judiciary. 
  Glaude J. signed the reasons. I have no reason to think that he did not read 
  them and come to the conclusion that they accurately described why he had chosen 
  to grant the authorization. The appellant Jackpine has not met the heavy onus 
  on him of demonstrating a reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
<p>
  [59] Although I am satisfied that the trial judge's adoption of the reasons 
  proposed by the Crown does not raise a reasonable apprehension of bias, I confess 
  some unease with the practice. It is one thing for a party to prepare the proposed 
  order of the court, but quite another for a party to prepare the proposed reasons 
  for making the order. I think the appearance of justice is best served by leaving 
  the reasons to the judge. </p>
<p>
  VI</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [60] I would allow the appeals and quash the authorizations for the taking of 
  the appellants' bodily substances made by Glaude J. The applications for the 
  authorizations were, however, properly commenced. I would remit the applications 
  to the Ontario Court of Justice for a determination on their merits. As there 
  can be no argument at this stage that the appellants should not receive notice, 
  they should be given notice either personally or through counsel.</p>
<p>
  [61] The samples taken from the appellants but not analyzed, should be held 
  pending the conclusion of the application. If authorizations are granted, those 
  samples may be used for the purposes of analysis. If the applications are refused, 
  the samples should be destroyed.</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> Pending the outcome of the motion before 
  Trainor J., the appellants and the Crown agreed that the appellants would provide 
  the required samples, but they would not be analyzed or placed in the DNA databank. 
  The samples were sealed pending the result of the motion before Justice Trainor. 
  They remain sealed pending the outcome of the appeal. </p>
<p><a href="#r2">[2]</a> Persons caught by this section are a finite group. As 
  time passes, fewer and fewer individuals will be caught by this section. It 
  is estimated that there were some 2,500 potential retroactive cases when the 
  Act was proclaimed. The court was informed that as of October 2003, some 1,770 
  DNA profiles of retroactive offenders had been put into the DNA databank. The 
  Attorney General had assigned a team of Crown Attorneys to identify those offenders 
  who were subject to s. 487.055(1) and to proceed with the applications against 
  those individuals.</p>
<p><a href="#r3">[3]</a> I have analyzed the procedural due process claim under 
  s. 7, the section relied on by the appellants. Procedural due process claims 
  seem most at home under s. 7 of the Charter. It may be, as the Crown contends, 
  that after R. v. B.S.A., supra, at pp. 208-209, the claim should be considered 
  as part of the s. 8 analysis. In my view, the analysis is the same under both 
  sections. A provision allowing for ex parte applications does not offend either 
  s. 7 or s. 8. An interpretation of the discretion in the section which requires 
  notice unless the Crown establishes cause to proceed ex parte, is consistent 
  with both sections.</p>
