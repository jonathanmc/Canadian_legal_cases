<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>Nature of Appeal</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant Tyrone Jackson appeals against his conviction entered by Justice 
  Nordheimer, sitting with a jury, on August 27, 2002 of possession of a firearm 
  (s. 91(1)), assault with intent to resist arrest (s. 270(1)(b)); and fail to 
  comply with a recognizance (s. 145(3)). He was acquitted of the charge of possession 
  of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking and the lesser and included offence 
  of simple possession. </p>
<p>
  Facts</p>
<p>
  [2] In the early morning of November 27, 2001, two plainclothes police officers 
  were patrolling the Lawrence Heights area of Toronto in an unmarked car. They 
  saw two black males walking. One of the males was the appellant. Approximately 
  25 minutes later, another police officer advised the two officers that he had 
  heard a gunshot. The officers drove back to where the two men were walking. 
  They told the two men that they were police officers and wished to speak to 
  them, but did not show a badge or identification. The two men ran away. The 
  officers chased them. One man got away. The other, the appellant, was apprehended.</p>
<p>
  [3] At trial, the appellant applied unsuccessfully, pursuant to ss. 8, 9 and 
  24(2) of the Charter, to have the gun and drugs excluded. Constable Manherz 
  testified that he stopped the appellant while he was trying to climb over a 
  fence and testified that in the process a gun fell out of the appellant's pocket. 
  While Constable Manherz was trying to restrain him, Constable Kidd arrived, 
  and then two other officers arrived also. All the officers testified during 
  the voir dire that they saw the gun during the attempt to subdue the appellant. 
  Constable Manherz also testified that after the appellant was arrested, he found 
  cocaine in the appellant's pocket. </p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge ruled that the appellant's detention was justified, but 
  in the alternative, he would not have excluded the edivence under s. 24(2), 
  as the evidence was not conscriptive and the breach of the appellant's rights 
  was not serious. The Crown relied on the evidence of Constable Manherz and the 
  other police officers to prove the firearm charges and the evidence of Constable 
  Manherz with respect to the cocaine charge.</p>
<p>
  [5] A defence witness, Matthew Joseph, testified that he was the person who 
  got away, that both the gun and the drugs were his, and that he had disposed 
  of them during the chase.</p>
<p>
  [6] The jury found the appellant guilty of possessing the gun but acquitted 
  him of possessing the cocaine. </p>
<p>
  The Issues and our Disposition of them</p>
<p>
  1. Were the verdicts inconsistent?</p>
<p>
  [7] Having regard to the fact that a jury is entitled to believe all, part or 
  none of a witness' evidence the verdicts were not inconsistent. This is not 
  a case involving verdicts that in logic were mutually contradictory or violently 
  at odds in relation to the indictment or the evidence. In addition to Constable 
  Manherz, three other police officers testified that they saw the gun on the 
  ground next to the fence where the appellant was arrested. Prior to this the 
  officers had heard a gunshot. Only Constable Manherz testified that he found 
  cocaine in the appellant's pocket. A reasonable jury properly instructed and 
  acting reasonably could have arrived at these verdicts. </p>
<p>
  2. Did the trial judge err in failing to give a "W.(D.)" instruction?</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant submits that the effect of the trial judge's failure to give 
  the R. v. W.(D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.) instruction, combined with 
  certain references in the charge, gave the jury the choice of either accepting 
  the evidence or rejecting it and that the jury were not aware that a reasonable 
  doubt could arise from evidence that they did not accept or reject. The appellant 
  further submits that the trial judge did not make it clear that reasonable doubt 
  applied to credibility.</p>
<p>
  [9] The trial judge's charge to the jury made clear that in arriving at reasonable 
  doubt, the jury was not restricted to the evidence that it accepted. It was 
  made clear that a reasonable doubt should be based on the entirety of the evidence 
  and that reasonable doubt could be based on the absence of evidence. While it 
  would have been preferable for the trial judge to have given the W.(D.) instruction, 
  the jury could not have been under any misapprehension as to the correct standard 
  and burden of proof having regard to its verdict in relation to the cocaine 
  charge. </p>
<p>
  3. Did the trial judge erroneously conclude that the appellant's detention was 
  justified? If so, should the evidence of the gun have been excluded under s. 
  24(2) of the Charter?</p>
<p>
  [10] We agree with the trial judge that the "constellation of objectively 
  discernible facts" including the appellant's attempt to flee from the police 
  provided reasonable grounds for the officers to pursue and detain him. Even 
  if we had concluded that there was a violation of s. 9 of the Charter we would 
  not be prepared to differ from the trial judge's assessment that the exclusion 
  of the gun would bring the administration of justice into disrepute much more 
  than its admission. </p>
<p>
  4. Did the trial judge err in concluding that, in relation to count 2, assault 
  with intent to resist arrest, the appellant's detention was lawful and in instructing 
  the jury to this effect?</p>
<p>
  [11] The trial judge made a ruling during the trial that the appellant's detention 
  was lawful. There was a solid basis for this ruling. There was no need to revive 
  this issue for the jury's consideration, especially since defence counsel did 
  not suggest it or object to this component of the charge. </p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [12] We would not give effect to any of the grounds of appeal and accordingly, 
  the appeal is dismissed.</p>
