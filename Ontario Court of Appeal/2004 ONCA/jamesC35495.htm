<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In the view we take of this case, it is unnecessary to decide whether the 
  authorizing judge's failure to give notice to appellant's counsel would, in 
  these circumstances, deprive the judge of jurisdiction to issue the DNA warrant. 
  Assuming without deciding that the authorizing judge should have required the 
  police to give defence counsel notice of the application and that the failure 
  to do so, in the particular circumstances of this case, led to a loss of jurisdiction, 
  we are satisfied that the evidence would, in any event, be admissible under 
  s. 24(2) of the Charter.</p>
<p>[2] The evidence would inevitably have been discovered and therefore the breach 
  of s. 8 of the Charter would not affect trial fairness. The breach was not serious. 
  The police acted in good faith in informing the authorizing judge of defence 
  counsel's letter. The police had reasonable grounds for obtaining the warrant 
  and its sufficiency has not been challenged. These were very serious offences 
  and the DNA evidence was essential to prove these offences. We note as well 
  that DNA evidence was instrumental in eliminating another suspect. Exclusion 
  of the evidence would adversely affect the reputation of the administration 
  of justice.</p>
<p>[3] We are also satisfied that the trial judge's directions concerning the 
  use of evidence of other counts was adequate in the circumstances. When the 
  charge is read as a whole, we are satisfied that there was no risk that the 
  jury would misuse the evidence.</p>
<p>[4] As to sentence, we agree that the trial judge erred in principle in refusing 
  to give two for one credit for pre-sentence custody solely because she believed 
  the appellant required a longer sentence for treatment. It therefore falls to 
  this court to consider the fitness of the sentence. We are satisfied that the 
  sentence of six years in addition to the three and one-half years of pre-sentence 
  custody was fit. The appellant committed six very serious sexual assaults on 
  complete strangers over a two-year period. The appellant threatened the youthful 
  victims with weapons and also confined and robbed the victims. A total effective 
  sentence of thirteen years was within the appropriate range for this conduct.</p>
<p>[5] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence 
  is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
