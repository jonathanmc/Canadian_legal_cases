<p>On appeal from sentence imposed by Justice Robert Bigelow of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice on June 27, 2003.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  MOLDAVER J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] The respondent pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated sexual assault 
  and one count of assault causing bodily harm in relation to his six year old 
  stepdaughter K.H. and one count of aggravated assault in relation to his five 
  week old biological son N.K. He was sentenced to a global term of six years 
  in the penitentiary (in addition to being credited with four years for pre-trial 
  custody calculated on a scale of just less than three for one). </p>
<p>
  [2] In arriving at the global sentence, the trial judge found that "the 
  assaults on K.H. and N.K. [were] each on their own of a nature to justify penitentiary 
  sentences in the mid to upper range". However, "taking into account 
  the principle of totality", he concluded that "a total sentence of 
  10 years, less credit for pre-trial custody [four years] would be appropriate". 
  To achieve that result, on the charges relating to K.H., the trial judge imposed 
  a sentence of three years for the offence of aggravated sexual assault and two 
  years concurrent for the offence of assault causing bodily harm. On the charge 
  of aggravated assault in relation of N.K., he imposed a further sentence of 
  three years to be served consecutively.</p>
<p>
  [3] The Crown applies for leave to appeal and if leave is granted, seeks to 
  have the global sentence increased to sixteen years, less four years credit 
  for pre-trial custody. In other words, the Crown seeks to have the present six-year 
  global sentence increased to twelve years.</p>
<p> [4] For reasons that follow, I am satisfied that the sentence imposed at trial 
  cannot stand. In my view, it was manifestly inadequate and suffered from the 
  following errors in principle: </p>
<ul>
  <li>it over-emphasized the principle of totality;</li>
  <li>it failed to adequately reflect the gravity and seriousness of the respondent's 
    crimes;</li>
  <li>it failed to adequately address the objectives of deterrence and denunciation; 
    and </li>
  <li>it failed to adequately address the pressing need to separate the respondent 
    from society to protect the lives and safety of other innocent children. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I accept the Crown's submission that this is a case in which a 
  global sentence of sixteen years (less four years for pre-trial custody)<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
  was called for. Indeed, in my view, the sentence could have been higher. </p>
<p>
  THE OFFENCES AND THE APPROPRIATE SENTENCES</p>
<p>[5] As indicated, I am of the view that in arriving at the global sentence 
  of ten years (less four years for pre-trial custody), the trial judge committed 
  several errors in principle. </p>
<p>
  [6] First, on the charge of aggravated sexual assault against K.H., he imposed 
  a sentence that was wholly inadequate. The facts giving rise to that charge 
  are horrific. They involve a vile and sadistic act of brutality. </p>
<p>
  [7] The assault occurred in 1995 when K.H. was six years old. On the day in 
  question, the respondent came into K.H.'s room where she was lying on her back 
  on the bed. He placed a towel over her knees so that she could not see the lower 
  portion of her body. K.H. suddenly felt severe pain as the respondent forced 
  something into her vagina. She thought it was a crayon but she was not sure. 
  Profuse bleeding followed. Because of this, the respondent forced K.H. to take 
  a bath. Eventually, K.H.'s mother came home and saw the bleeding. After trying 
  unsuccessfully to stop the bleeding, K.H. was taken to the hospital by her mother 
  and the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [8] At the hospital, it was observed that K.H. had severe bruising on her thighs. 
  Her vagina was torn so violently that she needed a blood transfusion and stitches 
  to repair the damage. During surgery, the doctors noted a second-degree tear 
  to her hymen and intra-vaginal bruising. K.H. was admitted to the hospital where 
  she received ongoing medical treatment. Photographs of her injuries are contained 
  in the record. They are gruesome.</p>
<p>
  [9] The crime of aggravated sexual assault is punishable by imprisonment for 
  life. What the respondent did to K.H. was degrading and dehumanizing and constituted 
  an extreme act of brutality. Far from warranting a sentence of less than five 
  years (the trial judge imposed a combined global sentence of five years for 
  that offence and the additional offence of assault causing bodily harm), I am 
  of the view that that crime alone warranted a sentence of at least six years 
  in the penitentiary. </p>
<p>
  [10] Second, on the charge of assault causing bodily harm against K.H., the 
  trial judge erred in imposing a concurrent sentence. A consecutive sentence 
  was called for because the incidents giving rise to that charge were separate 
  and distinct from the incident underlying the charge of aggravated sexual assault.</p>
<p> [11] The facts relating to the charge of assault causing bodily harm are most 
  disturbing. They too occurred when K.H. was six years old. K.H. could only remember 
  five specific incidents. She described them as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The respondent took her to his workplace. He grabbed her around the neck 
    and held her off the ground, choking her. He eventually dropped her onto the 
    floor.</li>
  <li>K.H. was at home with the respondent. She was lying on her stomach on her 
    bed. The respondent came in, grabbed her legs and bent them up towards her 
    head. K.H. could not breathe. She struggled until the respondent eventually 
    let go. </li>
  <li>On one occasion when family members were visiting, the respondent waited 
    for K.H. to be alone in her room. He came into the room and punched her in 
    the ribs. K.H. fell to the ground. The respondent held her on the ground before 
    getting up and leaving the room.</li>
  <li>The respondent came into K.H.'s bedroom, again when she was alone. He dragged 
    her into the bathroom, wrapped a towel around her neck and pulled it tight 
    to choke her. K.H. thought he was going to kill her.</li>
  <li>When K.H. was having a bath, the respondent came into the room, grabbed 
    her neck and held her head under the water. She struggled and was eventually 
    able to raise her head out of the water to breathe. The respondent continued 
    choking her with his hands around her neck.</li>
</ul>
<p>[12] When K.H. was hospitalized for the vaginal injury giving rise to the charge 
  of aggravated sexual assault, she was seen by the Suspected Child Abuse and 
  Neglect (SCAN) Program. The SCAN report showed extensive injuries in various 
  stages of healing. At the time she was admitted to the hospital, K.H. had a 
  broken arm, substantial bruising at several different stages of healing on her 
  inner thighs, bruising on her back and shoulders, bruising on her jaw, several 
  groupings of bruises and discoloured areas above and below her left nipple and 
  bruising to her lower abdomen, chest, arms, legs and buttocks. She was unable 
  to bear weight on her right leg. X-rays showed nine healing rib fractures, three 
  other possible rib fractures and fractures of the forearm, left finger and elbow. 
  The report also noted that K.H. had had two previous incidents of vaginal and 
  anal bleeding. Dr. Huyer, a physician with the SCAN program, Hospital for Sick 
  Children, found that the injuries to her vagina could not have been accidental 
  and that the nine rib fractures were attributable to physical abuse.</p>
<p>
  [13] In short, it is apparent that the respondent brutalized K.H. on a regular 
  and persistent basis. The acts of violence were cruel, vicious, and utterly 
  reprehensible. In some instances, they bordered on torture. </p>
<p>
  [14] I view this as a most egregious case of assault causing bodily harm. The 
  offence of assault causing bodily harm is punishable by a term of imprisonment 
  not exceeding ten years. On the facts of this case, far from warranting a concurrent 
  sentence of two years (the sentence imposed by the trial judge), I am satisfied 
  that this crime called for a consecutive sentence of at least three years in 
  the penitentiary. </p>
<p>
  [15] Third, on the charge of aggravated assault against N.K., the sentence imposed 
  by the trial judge was inadequate. The facts giving rise to that charge are 
  shocking. </p>
<p>
  [16] The respondent married J.K. in 1999. On August 27, 2001, N.K. was born. 
  On September 7, at eleven days old, N.K. was seen by his family doctor who noted 
  a mass on his scrotum. The doctor instructed J.K. and the respondent to take 
  N.K. to the hospital for further investigation. N.K.'s mother took him to the 
  Hospital for Sick Children on September 11. The hospital records show that N.K. 
  had been fussy and inconsolable for three days. He was crying uncontrollably 
  and had a swollen dark testicle. He had two bluish marks on his lower back and 
  a bruise on his inner thigh. </p>
<p>
  [17] On October 1, J.K. again took N.K. to the family doctor. The doctor noted 
  a "black and blue" right testicle. He referred N.K. to a paediatrician 
  to investigate the testicular bruising. </p>
<p>
  [18] On October 4, when N.K. was five weeks old, his mother took him to the 
  emergency department of the Hospital for Sick Children. He had a swollen bruised 
  testicle and the top of his scrotum was bleeding. This condition was ongoing 
  for three days before his arrival at the hospital. Medical staff noted bruises 
  on the child's cheek, jaw, chest, abdomen and knee. Haemorrhaging was observed 
  in both eyes and the skin joining his tongue to the floor of this mouth was 
  torn. Doctors were concerned about possible abuse and N.K. was referred to the 
  SCAN program.</p>
<p> [19] On October 5, 2001, doctors in the SCAN program examined N.K. and reviewed 
  his medical records. In addition to the bruising, torn frenulum, and eye haemorrhages, 
  SCAN staff identified the following injuries: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Thirty rib fractures in various stages of healing (at least one fracture 
    on every rib imaged).</li>
  <li>Fractures of both clavicles (collarbones).</li>
  <li>Two leg fractures, one above the knee and one just above the ankle.</li>
  <li>A wrist fracture.</li>
  <li>A foot fracture.</li>
  <li>A fracture of the spinal process.</li>
  <li>Compression fractures of several vertebrae.</li>
</ul>
<p>[20] The SCAN report indicated that an infant as young as N.K. could not have 
  sustained the type of bruising he exhibited from normal activity. The bruises 
  were consistent with pinching or grabbing. Bruising of the scrotum was consistent 
  with a forceful blow or twisting. Violent squeezing or shaking could account 
  for the rib and clavicle fractures. Fractures to N.K.'s legs were likely caused 
  by yanking, tugging or twisting of the limbs or violent shaking.</p>
<p>
  [21] In January 2002, the Hospital for Sick Children provided an updated report 
  outlining the results of MRI scans on N.K.'s brain and spine. The report concluded 
  that N.K. may have suffered brain injury and is at risk for developmental delays 
  and neurological abnormalities.</p>
<p>
  [22] The offence of aggravated assault is punishable by a term of imprisonment 
  not exceeding fourteen years. The respondent's violent conduct towards N.K. 
  defies comprehension. He brutalized his infant, helpless child who may, tragically, 
  have suffered serious permanent injuries.</p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge imposed a sentence of three years imprisonment for this 
  crime (in addition to two years for pre-trial custody). That sentence was inadequate. 
  The respondent's crime was horrific. It warranted a sentence of at least seven 
  years in the penitentiary.</p>
<p> [24] Having determined that a global sentence of sixteen years was warranted, 
  I must consider whether that length of imprisonment offends the principle of 
  totality.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="2"></a> That in turn, brings me to the 
  fourth error committed by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [25] With respect, I am of the view that in imposing the global sentence he 
  did, the trial judge gave too much weight to the principle of totality and insufficient 
  weight to the need to protect society from the respondent. Specifically, he 
  failed to give sufficient consideration to the respondent's severe psychiatric 
  condition and the danger he poses to society.</p>
<p>
  [26] Without going into detail, the psychiatric evidence portrays the respondent 
  as a sexual sadist with paedophilic tendencies. He is also prone to substance 
  abuse and extreme acts of violence. Indeed, his violence is said to be the product 
  of a "chronic and stable personality disorder which may be difficult to 
  change". </p>
<p>
  [27] The psychiatric evidence further indicates that without treatment, there 
  is more than a fifty percent chance that the respondent will commit further 
  violent crimes within the next ten years. According to Dr. Fedoroff of the Royal 
  Ottawa Hospital, testing supports the possibility that the respondent "may 
  be sexually aroused from aggressive or sadistic acts, particularly those directed 
  toward male and female children". He recommends treatment for sexual sadism 
  and pedophilia, as well as anger management and substance abuse.</p>
<p>
  [28] In short, based on the psychiatric evidence, I am satisfied that the respondent 
  presents a continuing danger to society and he puts at serious risk the lives 
  and safety of other innocent children. </p>
<p>
  [29] In the circumstances, I am firmly of the view that the sentence imposed 
  should have reflected the need "to separate offenders like the respondent 
  from society". That objective of sentencing is identified in s. 718(c) 
  of the Criminal Code. It deserved particular attention in this case. Unfortunately, 
  the trial judge failed to give it adequate, if any, weight (see R. v. D. (D.) 
  (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 471 at 483 (Ont. C.A.)). </p>
<p>
  [30] When that objective is taken in account, the proposed global sentence of 
  sixteen years does not offend against the principle of totality. Indeed, having 
  regard to the horrendous nature of the respondent's crimes, his high degree 
  of moral blameworthiness, and the pressing need to segregate him from society 
  lest he destroy the lives of other innocent children, it could have been more 
  severe. What spares the respondent (age thirty-five at the time of sentencing) 
  from an even higher sentence, is his lack of prior criminal record, his steady 
  work record and, most significantly, the glimmer of hope, referenced in Dr. 
  Fedoroff's psychiatric report, that he may have some insight into the nature 
  of his crimes and the need for treatment. </p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>[31] For these reasons, leave to appeal is granted and the appeal against sentence 
  is allowed. The sentence imposed at trial is varied as follows. On the charge 
  of aggravated sexual assault against K.H., I would impose a sentence of six 
  years less two years for pre-trial custody for a total of four years. On the 
  charge of assault causing bodily harm against K.H., I would impose a sentence 
  of three years consecutive. On the charge of aggravated assault against N.K., 
  I would impose a sentence of seven years less two years for pre-trial custody 
  for a total of five years. Hence, after crediting the respondent for time served 
  in pre-trial custody, the global remaining sentence is increased from six years 
  to twelve years. In all other respects, the sentence imposed at trial shall 
  remain the same.</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="a"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> The Crown did not challenge the four-year 
  figure. For my part, I find it disturbing that eighteen months of actual pre-trial 
  custody can translate into a credit of four years. It seems to me that lately, 
  the issue of credit for pre-trial custody is taking on a life of its own. Unchecked, 
  it can skew and even swallow up the entire sentencing process. In short, it 
  may be time to revisit the manner in which credit for pre-trial custody is assessed. 
  However, since the matter was not raised or argued, it is best left for another 
  day. </p>
<p><a href="#2">[2]</a> The principle of totality ensures that the cumulative 
  sentence is not disproportionate to the offender&#146;s overall culpability:
