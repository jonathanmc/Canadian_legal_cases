<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Mr. Jones asks this court to set aside his conviction for assault and sexual 
  assault on five grounds: (1) alleged inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence; 
  (2) the trial judge misapprehended the evidence regarding the pre-trial identification 
  process; (3) he was not in Canada at the time of the offence and therefore could 
  not have committed the offence; (4) the complainant's testimony should have 
  been rejected as she failed to mention that he had tattoos on his chest and 
  she testified that her assailant had two nipple rings whereas he has only one 
  nipple ring; and, (5) as the defence witness, Jean Brown, denied making prior 
  inconsistent statements to the police and the statements were not proven, the 
  trial judge erred in relying upon them. </p>
<p>
  Inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence</p>
<p>
  [2] There are two alleged inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence. The 
  first is that she testified that the assailant grabbed her breast but she did 
  not include that information in the statement that she gave to the police. The 
  second is that she testified that the assailant grabbed at her crotch area more 
  than once whereas she only related one such incident when giving her statement 
  to the police. </p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge was entitled to find, as he did, that the complainant satisfactorily 
  explained the inconsistencies when she said that she neglected to mention them 
  in her police statement as she did not think that they were important aspects 
  of the assault.</p>
<p>
  The pre-trial identification process</p>
<p>
  [4] We are satisfied that the pre-trial identification process was sound. The 
  complainant was presented with nine photographs, was clearly told that she was 
  under no compulsion to choose any person based on the photographs and identified 
  the accused from the photographs. Any flaws or weaknesses in the process went 
  to the weight to be accorded the identification and not to admissibility.</p>
<p>
  Presence of the appellant in Canada</p>
<p>
  [5] The trial judge dealt with the appellant's contention that he was not in 
  Canada at the time of the offence. On the record, he was fully justified in 
  rejecting that testimony.</p>
<p>
  The tattoos and nipple rings</p>
<p>
  [6] Similarly, the trial judge was alive to the matters of the tattoos and nipple 
  rings. In light of the record, which includes the fact that there was no evidence 
  as to how high the assailant lifted his shirt when assaulting the complainant, 
  there is no basis for interfering with his finding in this regard.</p>
<p>
  Jean Brown's statements</p>
<p>
  [7] The trial judge was explicitly aware of the inconsistencies in the evidence 
  tendered by the various witnesses. We accept that he erred in attributing the 
  complainant's statement that "Mike hit her" to Jean Brown. However, 
  as Richard Miuse also gave that evidence, we are not satisfied that the appellant 
  was prejudiced or that it led to any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. 
  </p>
<p>
  [8] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
