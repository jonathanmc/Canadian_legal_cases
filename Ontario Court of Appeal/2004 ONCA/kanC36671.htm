<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals his convictions for aggravated assault and discharging 
  a firearm with intent to endanger life. He makes two submissions. First, the 
  trial judge wrongly precluded him from eliciting the exculpatory parts of his 
  statement; and second, the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to cross-examine 
  him on the previous shooting incident on February 1. </p>
<p>[2] We think that there are three answers to the first submission. First, the 
  trial judge's ruling did not prevent the appellant from seeking to lead the 
  exculpatory parts of his statement in re-examination. He did not try to do so. 
  Second, as the Crown points out, in one way or another, all of the evidence 
  that might have been elicited came out at the trial. Third, as Ms. Forrester 
  candidly acknowledged, this alleged error likely had very little impact on the 
  verdict.</p>
<p>[3] We do not agree with the appellant's second submission. In our view, the 
  previous incident was relevant to the extent of the appellant's knowledge of 
  the other two men. Any prejudice from the cross-examination on the incident 
  was, at its highest, minimal. The cross-examination did not suggest that the 
  appellant was anything other than a witness to the previous incident. Moreover, 
  it was open to the appellant to clarify his role in re-examination. He chose 
  not to do so. Thus, we find no error in the trial judge's ruling. Even if she 
  did err, the evidence played a minor role in the case. Therefore, its admission 
  caused no substantial wrong.</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.</p>
