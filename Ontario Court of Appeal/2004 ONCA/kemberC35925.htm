<p>On appeals from the convictions entered by Justice Desotti of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated March 19, 2001.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Both appellants were charged in count one of an indictment: </p>
<p class="indent">
  That between the 1st day of January, 1994 and the 31st day of March 1994 inclusive 
  at the City of Sarnia, in the Province of Ontario being together they did possess 
  a 1994 Chevrolet black pickup truck (VIN #2GCDC14ZXJ1306863) of a value exceeding 
  $1,000.00 knowing the said 1994 Chevrolet black pickup truck (VIN #2GCDC14ZXJ1306863) 
  contained a frame upon which the vehicle identification number had been wholly 
  or partially removed or obliterated and thereby having been obtained by an offence 
  punishable by indictment, contrary to Section 355(a) of the Criminal Code of 
  Canada.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant, Kember was also charged in count two: </p>
<p class="indent">
  That between the 15th day of July, 1992 and the 31st day of March, 1995 inclusive 
  at the City of Sarnia, in the Province of Ontario he did by deceit, falsehood 
  or other fraudulent means, defraud Anthony Desangher of a 1991 Chevrolet white 
  pickup truck (VIN #1GCDK14HOMZ210357) of a value exceeding $5,000.00 by not 
  declaring the said 1991 Chevrolet white pickup truck (VIN #1GCDK14HOMZ210357) 
  was a rebuilt pickup truck, composed of parts from other vehicles, contrary 
  to Section 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [3] The jury convicted both appellants on count one and convicted Kember on 
  count two. The appellants appeal from those convictions. </p>
<p>
  [4] I would allow the appeals. With respect to the conviction on count two, 
  I am satisfied that the Crown led no evidence to support the fraud alleged in 
  that count. The conviction must be quashed and an acquittal entered. With respect 
  to the convictions on count one, I am satisfied that it was not made clear to 
  the jury that the Crown had to prove that the appellants knew that the truck 
  frame referred to in count one was obtained by the commission of an indictable 
  offence. The convictions must be quashed and a new trial ordered.</p>
<p>
  The Appeal on Count Two</p>
<p>
  [5] Count two alleged that Kember defrauded Anthony Desangher of a pickup truck 
  described in the indictment with a value exceeding $5,000.00. The Crown's evidence 
  revealed that Mr. Desangher purchased a truck with the VIN number identified 
  in count two from Mr. Kember for about $16,500.00. Mr. Desangher was told that 
  the cab had been refurbished after a fire and that the engine may have been 
  replaced. The Crown led evidence that the vehicle was a "rebuild", 
  referred to as a "Heinz 57", because it was put together with parts 
  from numerous other vehicles some of which may have been stolen. </p>
<p>
  [6] Desangher had difficulties with the truck shortly after he purchased it. 
  He learned that it was a "Heinz 57". Desangher and Kember negotiated 
  the return of the vehicle to Kember. Kember took the truck back and refunded 
  part of the purchase price to Desangher.</p>
<p>
  [7] On the Crown's evidence, the allegation of fraud was one of fraud by misrepresentation 
  as to the true nature of the vehicle sold to Desangher. The Crown put its case 
  this way in her closing: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;It's also clear that Mr. Desangher purchased what he believed was a 1991 
  Chev pickup truck with a VIN number as described and that he paid well over 
  $5,000.00 for it, closer to $18,000.00 I think including tax. And I'm going 
  to suggest to you that it's pretty clear that what Mr. Desangher believed he 
  paid for was not what he got to take home. I'm going to suggest to you, that 
  evidence isn't too confusing. It's very straightforward. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [8] In his closing argument, counsel for the appellant, Kember, said this: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; Defraud is like cheating. I agree with that. I think you use the word 
  cheating whether you did it or didn't I will use the word cheat. Cheating out 
  of what? Out of his truck. That's what the charge is. When did he part with 
  his truck? Well, after all the things are involved he got involved with a civil 
  action and parted with his truck. Did defraud Desangher of his truck. Well I'm 
  sorry ladies and gentlemen, he didn't do that. He just didn't do that. He did 
  not on any basis defraud Desangher of his truck and that's what he's charged 
  with. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [9] The trial judge's instructions on count two were brief. He told the jury 
  that it was the position of the Crown that the appellant, Kember had committed 
  fraud because he did not tell Mr. Desangher that he was purchasing a rebuilt 
  truck. The trial judge also told the jury, incorrectly according to trial counsel, 
  that it was the position of the defence that there was no fraud because Mr. 
  Desangher got essentially what he had agreed to buy from Kember.</p>
<p>
  [10] I agree with the submissions made by trial counsel for the jury and repeated 
  by counsel for the appellant in this court. Whatever the Crown may have intended 
  to allege in count two, the wording of that count alleges that Mr. Desangher 
  was defrauded of the truck and not of the money he paid to purchase the truck. 
  </p>
<p>
  [11] The Crown may well have proved that the appellant, Kember was dishonest 
  in his dealings with Desangher and that through his dishonesty, Desangher parted 
  with $16,500.00. The Crown did not, however, prove that Desangher was ever deprived 
  through dishonesty of the truck. Desangher received the truck at the time of 
  the alleged misrepresentations and only parted with the truck as part of the 
  later civil settlement. There was no suggestion that the settlement was tainted 
  by misrepresentation or other dishonesty. </p>
<p>
  [12] It is unfortunate that the indictment as worded did not reflect the true 
  nature of the allegation advanced by the Crown. Trial counsel cannot, however, 
  be criticized for first raising the discrepancy between the allegation and the 
  evidence in his closing argument. He obviously took a chance. Had the Crown 
  requested an amendment to the charge, the trial court may well have ordered 
  the amendment. Crown counsel made no such request, but was content to go to 
  the jury on the charge as worded. Given the position taken by the defence and 
  Crown at trial, I think it is now too late to amend count two to conform with 
  the evidence led by the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [13] On the wording of count two as it went to the jury, the trial judge should 
  have told the jury that there was no evidence that Mr. Desangher had been defrauded 
  of the truck identified in count two. He should have told the jury to return 
  a verdict of not guilty on that charge as framed in count two. </p>
<p>
  The Appeal on Count One</p>
<p>
  [14] For convenience, I repeat the wording of count one.</p>
<p>
  That between the 1st day of January, 1994 and the 31st day of March 1994 inclusive 
  at the City of Sarnia, in the Province of Ontario being together they did possess 
  a 1994 Chevrolet black pickup truck (VIN #2GCDC14ZXJ1306863) of a value exceeding 
  $1,000.00 knowing the said 1994 Chevrolet black pickup truck (VIN #2GCDC14ZXJ1306863) 
  contained a frame upon which the vehicle identification number had been wholly 
  or partially removed or obliterated and thereby having been obtained by an offence 
  punishable by indictment, contrary to Section 355(a) of the Criminal Code of 
  Canada.</p>
<p> [15] The wording of count one is confusing. It refers to the offence of possession 
  of stolen property valued at over $1,000.00 (s. 355(a)). It also alleges that 
  the truck frame contained a wholly or partially obliterated VIN. This allegation 
  is not an element of any offence created by the Criminal Code, but by virtue 
  of the evidentiary presumption created in s. 354(2) can assist the Crown in 
  establishing that certain property was stolen.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [16] The mixing of language creating the offence of possession of property obtained 
  by crime with language referring to an evidentiary presumption that may assist 
  in proving the commission of that crime obscures the nature of the allegation 
  made in count one. Mr. Lepofsky, for the Crown, submits that count one alleges 
  possession of a frame of a truck with an obliterated VIN knowing that the frame 
  was obtained by crime. Counsel for the appellants contend that count one alleges 
  possession of a pickup truck knowing that a part of that pickup truck, the frame, 
  was obtained by crime. Counsel contend that if this interpretation is correct, 
  count one does not allege an offence known to law. Count one can also be read 
  as alleging possession of a truck frame with an obliterated VIN, knowing that 
  the VIN was obliterated. If this interpretation is correct, count one clearly 
  does not allege an offence known to law. </p>
<p>
  [17] There was no objection taken to count one at trial.</p>
<p>
  [18] Mr. Lepofsky has convinced me that count one alleges that the appellants 
  were in possession of a truck with a frame knowing that the frame was obtained 
  by the possession of crime. I am also satisfied, however, that it was not made 
  clear to the jury that the Crown had to prove that the appellants knew that 
  the truck frame was obtained by crime, and that it was not enough for the Crown 
  to prove only that the appellants knew that the VIN on the frame had been obliterated.</p>
<p>
  [19] The confusion as to the requisite knowledge appears in Crown counsel's 
  closing address. She said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;[T]hat's a question of whether the Crown has satisfied you beyond a reasonable 
  doubt on all of the evidence before you, that you accept, that the accused Andrew 
  Kember and the accused John Whitton did possess that black low rider pick-up 
  truck knowing that it contained a frame presumed to have been obtained by crime, 
  presumed to be stolen for example. [Emphasis added.] &#133;</p>
<p>
  [20] This description of count one suggests that knowledge that the frame contained 
  an obliterated VIN was sufficient to "presume" knowledge that the 
  frame was stolen. </p>
<p>
  [21] The trial judge began the relevant part of his instructions by reading 
  count one. Given the difficult wording of the count, this would not have assisted 
  the jury in understanding the nature of the allegation. The trial judge then 
  read s. 354(1) which creates the offence of possession of property obtained 
  by crime. The section is straightforward. He next referred to the evidentiary 
  presumption in s. 354(2), including the second part of the presumption which 
  has been held unconstitutional by this court: R. v. Boyle, supra. The trial 
  judge then told the jury: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In this particular case, the fact of the possession of the vehicle as described 
  in the indictment is not in issue. Furthermore, the presumption in law that 
  the obliteration of the vehicle identification number constitutes cogent evidence 
  that the motor vehicle was stolen or obtained by the commission of some other 
  indictable offence is a valid presumption in law. However, the Crown still bears 
  the burden of proof of establishing that the two accused had the required knowledge 
  of this fact, and must establish this fact of this knowledge beyond a reasonable 
  doubt. Therefore, the determining issue in this court that you must resolve 
  is whether you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Kember and Mr. 
  Whitton had this knowledge with respect to Count One. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [22] The references to "knowledge of this fact" in the above passage 
  are ambiguous. The reference may be to the fact that the VIN was obliterated, 
  or it may be to the fact that the property was obtained by crime. If the reference 
  is to the latter, the instruction is proper; if the reference is to the former, 
  the instruction is wrong in law. </p>
<p>
  [23] The ambiguity continues throughout the charge. For example, in the paragraph 
  immediately following the instruction quoted above, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;[T]he Crown concedes that it would have made her life easier if a particular 
  witness had come forward and testified that the two named individuals, the accused 
  parties, had told this witness that they knew they were selling a vehicle that 
  had an obliterated vehicle identification number. This would have been direct 
  evidence of their knowledge. &#133; [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [24] This instruction suggests that if the Crown had adduced evidence that the 
  appellants knew the VIN was obliterated, they would have provided direct evidence 
  of the requisite guilty knowledge. Knowledge that the VIN was obliterated could, 
  in the specific circumstances of this case, assist in proving that the appellants 
  knew that the truck frame was stolen. Knowledge that the VIN was obliterated 
  did not, however, in and of itself, establish the required mens rea. </p>
<p>
  [25] The trial judge's instructions on the theory of the Crown on count one 
  further suggests that proof that the VIN was obliterated established the necessary 
  mens rea: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;There is no direct evidence of knowledge and that onus rests with the 
  Crown Attorney. She must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that they knew 
  about the obliterated identification number on the frame that was ultimately 
  sold to Mr. Fox. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [26] In addition to the passages quoted above, there are references in the trial 
  judge's instructions that indicate that knowledge that the VIN was obliterated 
  provided the requisite culpable state of mind. There are, however, other parts 
  of the instruction in which the trial judge told the jury that they must be 
  satisfied that the appellants knew that the truck frame was stolen. This is 
  a correct description of the necessary mens rea.</p>
<p>
  [27] Considering the confusing language of count one, the comments of Crown 
  counsel in her closing address, and the entirety of the trial judge's instructions, 
  I do not think that it was not made clear to the jury that they could only convict 
  the appellants on count one if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt 
  that they knew that the frame identified in count one had been obtained by the 
  commission of a crime. The jury may well have thought that proof that the appellants 
  knew the VIN was obliterated would suffice. The convictions on count one must 
  be quashed.</p>
<p>
  [28] Counsel for the appellants submitted that it was not be appropriate to 
  order a new trial on count one. They informed the court that the appellants 
  had been through two trials on count one, the first ending in a mistrial. In 
  brief, they submitted that "enough was enough".</p>
<p>
  [29] The error necessitating the quashing of the convictions on count one is 
  an error in law. There was evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could 
  convict the appellants on count one. In such circumstances, this court normally 
  orders a new trial. The court does, however, have a discretion to decline to 
  order a new trial in appropriate circumstances. This court does not know enough 
  about the history of these proceedings to foreclose the Crown from proceeding 
  with a new trial should it decide to pursue that course of action. Nor is it 
  in a position to unequivocally reject the appellants' claim that there should 
  not be a third trial. If the Crown decides to proceed with a new trial and the 
  appellants wish to argue that a new trial would constitute an abuse of process, 
  they may do so before the trial court. </p>
<p>
  Post Script</p>
<p>
  [30] At trial, counsel for the appellants sought to elicit evidence from Crown 
  witnesses identifying the location of the hidden VIN on the truck frame which 
  was the subject of count one. It was this VIN which had allegedly been obliterated. 
  This VIN is placed on the part by the manufacturer and its location is not a 
  matter of common knowledge. Hidden VINs are used to locate and identify stolen 
  car parts. </p>
<p>
  [31] Crown counsel resisted the disclosure of any information disclosing the 
  location of the hidden VIN. Relying on the qualified public interest privilege 
  described in R. v. Richards (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 377 (Ont. C.A.), the trial 
  judge held that the witnesses were not obliged to disclose the location of the 
  hidden VIN. Counsel for the appellants challenged that ruling on appeal.</p>
<p>
  [32] As I have allowed the appeals on other grounds, it is not necessary to 
  address this issue. I am persuaded by Mr. Lepofsky that it would be inappropriate 
  to do so. If in fact the public interest privilege is applicable to information 
  as to the location of the hidden VIN, the applicability of that privilege requires 
  a careful balancing of competing interests in the context of the specific circumstances 
  of each case. This record is not sufficiently complete or clear to allow this 
  court to address the issue in a manner that would provide useful guidance if 
  there is another trial. </p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [33] The appeals are allowed. The convictions on count one are quashed and a 
  new trial is ordered. The conviction on count two is quashed and an acquittal 
  is entered.</p>
