<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Ernest Loukidelis of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated December 16, 2002.</p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A. (Dissenting): </p>
<p>
  [1] The issue on this appeal is whether the trial judge unreasonably exercised 
  his discretion by refusing to grant the appellant, Mr. Khimji, an adjournment 
  of his trial to permit the counsel he had retained to conduct the trial for 
  him. Instead of granting the adjournment, the trial judge dismissed Mr. Khimji's 
  action. It is from this dismissal that Mr. Khimji appeals. </p>
<p>
  A. Background</p>
<p>
  a) The dispute</p>
<p>
  [2] In late 1993 Mr. Khimji loaned Mr. Dhanani $120,000 US. In May 1998 Mr. 
  Dhanani died. In November 1998 Mr. Khimji's then lawyer wrote the respondent, 
  Shirin Dhanani (Mr. Dhanani's wife), demanding repayment of the loan. Mrs. Dhanani 
  replied by asserting that the loan had been repaid. </p>
<p>
  [3] In 1999 Mr. Khimji began this action, suing both Mrs. Dhanani and Mr. Dhanani's 
  daughter, the court-appointed estate trustee, for repayment of the loan. The 
  respondents acknowledge the loan. The only issue in the lawsuit is whether the 
  loan has been repaid.</p>
<p>
  b) Setting a trial date</p>
<p>
  [4] The action was scheduled to be tried in Newmarket on April 2, 2002. The 
  respondents, however, obtained an adjournment because of another death in their 
  family. Counsel for both sides told the court that they intended to amend their 
  pleadings. The trial was adjourned to the trial scheduling court until June 
  4, 2002. </p>
<p>
  [5] On June 4 both counsel agreed to a trial date during the week of November 
  11, 2002. The appellant amended his statement of claim in mid-July, and the 
  respondents amended their defence about a month later. Each side was to be permitted 
  additional discovery on the amended pleadings. Those additional discoveries 
  never took place.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant's difficulties began in early August when his lawyer obtained 
  an order removing himself as solicitor of record because of a dispute over fees. 
  A copy of the order of removal was served on Mr. Khimji by mail on August 13, 
  2002. </p>
<p>
  [7] Mr. Khimji took no steps to retain new counsel between mid-August 2003 and 
  the scheduled trial date during the week of November 11. He appeared unrepresented 
  before the trial judge on November 12, and requested an adjournment of one and 
  a half to two months, which was a reasonable request in order to obtain a lawyer 
  to conduct an anticipated three to four day trial. </p>
<p>
  [8] The respondents opposed the adjournment, but the trial judge granted it. 
  However, he gave the appellant little more than a month. He adjourned the trial 
  to December 16 and scheduled it for three days. He told the appellant that he 
  "must appear then with or without a lawyer" and added: "If you 
  don't show up or if you're not ready then, your case may be dismissed." 
  He marked the case "peremptory" but did not explain to the appellant 
  what that meant. Finally, he ordered the appellant to pay the respondents' costs 
  thrown away, fixed at $6,700, by the new trial date. </p>
<p>
  [9] On November 27, 2002, fifteen days after getting the adjournment, Mr. Khimji 
  met with a new lawyer, Mr. Dicker, of the law firm of Robins, Appleby &amp; 
  Taub. Mr. Dicker told Mr. Khimji that he would act for him if the trial could 
  be adjourned to the next scheduled sittings in Newmarket in March 2003. On December 
  10, 2002 Mr. Dicker sought an adjournment before Regional Senior Justice Shaunessy 
  but it was denied and the action ordered to proceed as scheduled on December 
  16. </p>
<p>
  c) The trial judge's ruling on December 16, 2002</p>
<p>
  [10] Mr. Khimji is legally blind and, though he can converse in English, is 
  not fluent in it. Because of these impediments, realistically he could not conduct 
  the trial himself. He needed a lawyer. He appeared before the trial judge on 
  December 16 with an interpreter and sought an adjournment so Mr. Dicker could 
  act. The respondents opposed the adjournment.</p>
<p>
  [11] The discussion before the trial judge was brief. Mr. Khimji had a letter 
  from Mr. Dicker in which Mr. Dicker said he would act for the appellant if the 
  trial could be adjourned to the next sittings. The trial judge did not want 
  to see the letter. Through his interpreter Mr. Khimji explained that he had 
  not paid the costs of $6,700 ordered on November 12 because he did not have 
  the money "to pay all at once" and wanted to arrange for monthly instalments. 
  The trial judge did not inquire about Mr. Khimji's means or about what payment 
  arrangements might be made. Instead he asked the appellant whether he was ready 
  to proceed by himself. The appellant answered that he was not. </p>
<p>
  [12] The trial judge then turned to counsel for the respondents, who asserted 
  that he was ready to proceed, that his clients needed "some closure" 
  and that Mr. Khimji's assertion that he had no money was "a lark". 
  </p>
<p>
  [13] The trial judge denied the adjournment and dismissed the action with the 
  following short endorsement: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Plaintiff appears in person with a translator. He again requests an adjournment. 
  Also the Plaintiff has not paid the costs previously ordered to be paid by today. 
  The Plaintiff is not prepared to proceed today. A further adjournment is denied. 
  The Plaintiff's action is therefore dismissed. Further costs to the defendants 
  to be assessed.</p>
<p>
  B. Discussion</p>
<p>
  [14] A trial judge enjoys wide latitude in deciding whether to grant or refuse 
  the adjournment of a scheduled civil trial. The decision is discretionary and 
  the scope for appellate intervention is correspondingly limited. In exercising 
  this discretion, however, the trial judge should balance the interests of the 
  plaintiff, the interests of the defendant and the interests of the administration 
  of justice in the orderly processing of civil trials on their merits. In any 
  particular case several considerations may bear on these interests. A trial 
  judge who fails to take account of relevant considerations may exercise his 
  or her discretion unreasonably and if, as a result, the decision is contrary 
  to the interests of justice, an appellate court is justified in intervening. 
  In my opinion, that is the case here. </p>
<p>
  [15] Even though the appellant had been told on November 12 that he must be 
  ready to proceed on December 16, his request for a further adjournment was reasonable 
  and should have been granted. He sought only a short adjournment to the next 
  sittings of the court. He had a lawyer ready to act. The adjournment would not 
  have disrupted the court's trial schedule. It would not have prejudiced the 
  other side, which had already been granted a much longer adjournment. And, though 
  the appellant had not paid the costs ordered on November 12, he had an explanation 
  for not having done so. In these circumstances the order depriving the appellant 
  of his right to pursue his claim was simply wrong. It was contrary to the interests 
  of justice. It should not be allowed to stand. </p>
<p>
  [16] The trial judge's refusal to adjourn the trial appears to have been based 
  on three considerations: his costs order of November 12, 2002 had not been paid; 
  he had already granted Mr. Khimji one adjournment; and he had marked the December 
  16 trial date "peremptory". </p>
<p>
  [17] These three considerations were all important. In some cases they might 
  have been determinative. But not in this case. Here, other considerations should 
  also have been taken into account.</p>
<p>
  1. The overall objective of civil proceedings: a just determination of the real 
  matters in dispute</p>
<p>
  [18] I begin with the overriding goal of our modern Rules of Civil Procedure: 
  to ensure as far as possible that cases are resolved on their merits. This goal 
  is expressly set out in Rule 2.01(1)(a), which gives a judge power to grant 
  any relief necessary "to secure the just determination of the real matters 
  in dispute". Courts should not be too quick to deprive litigants of a decision 
  on the merits. The trial judge does not appear to have sufficiently taken into 
  account that his order deprived the parties, especially the appellant, of a 
  determination of "the real matters in dispute". </p>
<p>
  2. Prejudice caused by refusing or granting an adjournment </p>
<p>
  [19] Under our modern Rules non-compensable prejudice plays a pivotal role in 
  deciding whether to grant an amendment or an adjournment. For example, under 
  Rule 26.01 a court shall (not may) grant leave to amend a pleading "at 
  any stage of an action" - on the eve of or even during a trial - "unless 
  prejudice would result that could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment." 
  Here, the prejudice to Mr. Khimji from the denial of an adjournment is obvious: 
  his action was dismissed without an adjudication on its merits. In his very 
  fair argument in this court, counsel for the respondents acknowledged that an 
  adjournment of the trial from December 2002 to March 2003 would not have prejudiced 
  his clients except for the costs incurred for the December 16 date. The trial 
  judge, however, did not canvass the question of prejudice. </p>
<p>
  3. Mr. Khimji's ability to pay the costs ordered on November 12, 2002</p>
<p>
  [20] Whether Mr. Khimji could or could not pay these costs was a relevant consideration. 
  If he genuinely could not pay them by December 16 but could, as he suggested, 
  pay them over time, then his failure to comply with the November costs order 
  should not have deprived him of his day in court. The trial judge was faced 
  with conflicting statements from Mr. Khimji and counsel for the respondents 
  on whether the appellant had the means to pay. Yet the trial judge made no inquiry 
  to resolve this conflict or determine whether the appellant had the ability 
  to pay. The appellant, in fact, paid these costs shortly before the hearing 
  of the appeal. </p>
<p>
  4. Mr. Khimji's explanation for not being ready for trial on December 16, 2002</p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant did not have a lawyer ready to proceed on December 16 and 
  he was incapable of representing himself. Admittedly, he bears some responsibility 
  for the position he found himself in. On the evidence before us, he did not 
  try to retain a new lawyer between the time his former lawyer withdrew from 
  his case and the scheduled November trial date. Moreover, after obtaining an 
  adjournment in November he waited fifteen days before speaking to Mr. Dicker. 
  Still, litigants do not always act with the haste that we, perhaps unrealistically, 
  expect of them. I do not regard Mr. Khimji's tardiness as being so prolonged 
  that it should have deprived him of a further adjournment. </p>
<p>
  [22] Also, as Mr. Khimji appeared alone on November 12, he may not have appreciated 
  the implications of a peremptory trial date. Even had he attempted to retain 
  a lawyer immediately after November 12, I doubt that he could have found a litigator 
  to take on a three day trial on such relatively short notice. Any reasonably 
  busy trial lawyer would have already had his or her schedule booked for that 
  period, as Mr. Dicker apparently did. </p>
<p>
  5. The length of the adjournment requested and disruption to the court's trial 
  schedule</p>
<p>
  [23] The appellant sought only a short adjournment to the next sittings of the 
  Newmarket court, when Mr. Dicker had undertaken to be available. Had the adjournment 
  been granted it would have delayed the trial for three and a half months. The 
  adjournment obtained by the respondents earlier in the year had caused a delay 
  of over seven months. Additionally, the adjournment requested by the appellant 
  would not have disrupted the Newmarket civil trial schedule. The December transcript 
  of the proceedings before the trial judge showed that he had another trial ready 
  to proceed. </p>
<p>
  C. Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [24] It seems to me, respectfully, that the trial judge gave short shrift to 
  Mr. Khimji's request for an adjournment. By dismissing the action the trial 
  judge deprived the appellant of the right to pursue a substantial claim of over 
  $150,000. In failing to take into account the considerations I have listed the 
  trial judge exercised his discretion unreasonably. Denying the appellant a further 
  adjournment in the absence of any prejudice to the respondents is contrary to 
  the interests of justice. The appellant should be allowed to maintain his action. 
  </p>
<p>
  [25] I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the order of Loukidelis J. 
  dated December 16, 2002 and in its place order that the action be tried at the 
  next civil sittings in Newmarket convenient to the court and to counsel for 
  the respondents. </p>
<p>
  [26] The respondents are entitled to their costs of preparing for and attending 
  at the hearing of December 16, 2002. However, the appellant is entitled to his 
  costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis. I would fix both parties' 
  costs in the offsetting amounts of $3,500, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>

  "John Laskin J.A."</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [27] I have had the privilege of reading the lucid reasons of Laskin J.A. I 
  adopt his summary of the facts and his statement of the principles governing 
  this appeal. I would only add that in determining whether to grant an adjournment 
  in this case, the trial judge had to consider not only the orderly processing 
  of civil trials, but the need to effectively enforce court orders. I think the 
  refusal of the adjournment in this case was justified principally because the 
  appellant all but ignored the order of the court made in November. He made virtually 
  no attempt to retain a lawyer who could act for him on the scheduled trial date, 
  or to pay even part of the costs order made against him.</p>
<p>
  [28] As my colleague points out, the appellant's first lawyer was removed from 
  the record in August 2002. The appellant had notice of his lawyer's motion to 
  be removed, but did not attend on the motion. Instead, he did nothing before 
  the scheduled trial date some three months later in November 2002. My colleague 
  describes the appellant's request for one and a half to two months adjournment 
  in November as a "reasonable request". While the length of the adjournment 
  requested was reasonable, the adjournment was only needed because the appellant 
  had done nothing to retain counsel since August 2002. Unlike the earlier adjournment 
  requested by the respondents, there was no good reason for this adjournment. 
  I would describe the appellant as seeking the indulgence of the court in November 
  as a result of his failure to take any steps to retain counsel between August 
  and November.</p>
<p>
  [29] A transcript of the November proceedings was not initially part of the 
  record on appeal. A copy was obtained at the court's request. It is clear from 
  that transcript that the appellant knew that he would be expected to be ready 
  for trial on the new trial date and indeed had agreed to that: </p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: We're going to set a new date for the trial.</p>
<p class="indent">ROSHANALI KHIMJI: Yes.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: And you must appear then with or without a lawyer.</p>
<p class="indent">ROSHANALI KHIMJI: Okay.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: And it's going to go ahead.</p>
<p class="indent">ROSHANALI KHIMJI: Okay.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: If you don't show up or if you're not ready then, 
  your case may be dismissed.</p>
<p class="indent">ROSHANALI KHIMJI: Okay.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: In addition, I'm going to award costs to the other 
  side for today. Do you understand?</p>
<p class="indent">ROSHANALI KHIMJI: Yes.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: And they'll be payable forthwith as well. Okay. The 
  date &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">TRIAL COORDINATOR: We do have next week available, Your Honour, 
  but I understand that Mr. Khimji will need some time to find a lawyer.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: Okay. How much time do you need to find a lawyer?</p>
<p class="indent">ROSHANALI KHIMJI: One and a half, two months.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: I'll give you &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">ROSHANALI KHIMJI: Because still now I not know any lawyer, and 
  my friend can look another lawyer for me and to splend (sic) everything in the 
  new lawyer and they have to study everything again, you know.THE COURT: What 
  about the middle of December?</p>
<p class="indent">ROSHANALI KHIMJI: Okay.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: Middle of December?</p>
<p class="indent">ROSHANALI KHIMJI: Okay.</p>
<p>
  [30] It is also evident that the appellant understood that he was obliged to 
  pay the costs awarded by the trial judge as a term of the adjournment. He did 
  not suggest that paying those costs posed any difficulty.</p>
<p>
  THE COURT: Okay. You have to pay that money by the date of the trial. You must 
  pay $6,720.00. Okay?</p>
<p>
  ROSHANALI KHIMJI: Okay.</p>
<p>
  [31] The appellant took no steps to retain counsel for some 15 days after the 
  November appearance even though he knew the trial was scheduled for December 
  16th. When the appellant finally got around to going to a lawyer, he went to 
  only one lawyer who told him that he was not available on the scheduled trial 
  date. Instead of seeking the assistance of other counsel who could be available 
  on the trial date, the appellant retained the lawyer who was not available on 
  the trial date. That counsel waited two weeks and then brought a motion for 
  an adjournment on the basis that he was not available on the trial date. </p>
<p>
  [32] I do not know how difficult it would have been for the appellant to find 
  a lawyer who could have been available on the December trial date. Lawyers have 
  been known to juggle their schedules to make themselves available on short notice. 
  I do know, however, that by waiting 15 days to contact any lawyer, by going 
  to see only one lawyer, and by retaining that lawyer even though he was not 
  available on the trial date, the appellant insured that he could not be ready 
  for trial on December 16th. </p>
<p>
  [33] In addition to effectively ignoring the December trial date when retaining 
  counsel, the appellant made no attempt to comply with the costs order that had 
  been made against him. There was a dispute as to appellant's ability to pay 
  those costs and the trial judge should have made some inquiry into the appellant's 
  ability to pay the order. However, even on the appellant's own version of events, 
  he could have paid some part of those costs, but instead chose to pay nothing. 
  </p>
<p>
  [34] The appellant is legally blind and is not fluent in the English language. 
  Neither is relevant to the reasonableness of the trial judge's refusal to grant 
  an adjournment. There was never any suggestion that the appellant would prosecute 
  this case himself. The real question was whether the trial judge failed to act 
  judicially in refusing to give the appellant a further adjournment so that he 
  could be represented by counsel. There was no suggestion that the appellant's 
  physical disability or his difficulties with the English language interfered 
  in any way with his ability to retain and instruct counsel. </p>
<p>
  [35] Individual litigants have a right to pursue and defend their respective 
  claims. They must do so, however, within a court structure that must accommodate 
  thousands of individual litigants. That system can function effectively only 
  when litigants take scheduling commitments seriously and make genuine efforts 
  to comply with court orders relating to adjournments and related matters. Where 
  a litigant successfully obtains the adjournment of a trial having failed to 
  exercise due diligence in retaining counsel, that litigant must expect that 
  absent unforeseen circumstances, the trial will proceed on the new trial date. 
  Similarly, where the adjournment is granted on terms the litigant must take 
  all reasonable efforts to comply with those terms. If in the assessment of the 
  trial court a litigant does not take reasonable steps to be prepared for the 
  new trial date and does not make reasonable attempts to comply with the associated 
  costs order, the trial court must have the authority to dismiss the claim. That 
  is not to say that the dismissal of the claim will be inevitable in circumstances 
  such as those presented on this appeal, but rather it is to say that the option 
  of dismissal must be available to the trial court to ensure the ongoing effective 
  operation of trial lists and to preserve the integrity of court orders. </p>
<p>
  [36] This court sits at a distance from the day-to-day operation of trial courts. 
  That distance must impair this court's ability to review decisions such as the 
  one under appeal. Strong deference is due to the decision of those in the trial 
  courts who are responsible for the day-to-day maintenance of an efficient and 
  just system of civil trials. Some judges may have given the appellant a third 
  opportunity to proceed to trial, despite his apparent disregard for previous 
  trial dates and his failure to make any attempt to comply with the court order 
  relating to costs. I would not have interfered with the decision granting a 
  third adjournment. Equally, however, I would not brand as unreasonable the decision 
  refusing a third adjournment in light of the appellant's failure to make any 
  effort to retain counsel who could act on the trial date and his failure to 
  make any effort to pay the costs order. The trial court is in a much better 
  position to balance the competing interests than is this court. I would dismiss 
  the appeal. </p>
