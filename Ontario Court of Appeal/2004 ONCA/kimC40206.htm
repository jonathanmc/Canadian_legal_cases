<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Following his plea of guilty, the offender was sentenced to a 9 month conditional 
  sentence plus twelve months probation for possession of child pornography and 
  distribution of child pornography. In addition, the offender received a s. 161 
  order for two years prohibiting access to children. The Crown seeks leave to 
  appeal the imposition of the conditional sentence and, if leave is granted, 
  appeals that sentence. </p>
<p>[2] The imposition of a non-custodial sentence in this case does not address 
  the gravity of the offence or the need for denunciation and deterrence. The 
  decision in R. v. Sharpe (2001), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) explicitly recognized 
  the link between the possession and distribution of child pornography and the 
  harm occasioned by the sexual abuse and exploitation of children. The Supreme 
  Court accepted that child pornography may fuel cognitive distortions normalizing 
  this harmful conduct. The overwhelming amount of child pornography seized, the 
  ages of the children involved, the nature of the acts in which they were involved 
  and the respondent's interest in the material, distinguish this case from R. 
  v. Cohen and R. v. Weber where conditional sentences were imposed. In R. v. 
  Lisk, [1998] O.J. No. 1456, this court stated, &quot;We agree that the principles 
  of deterrence and denunciation could only be adequately reflected in a sentence 
  involving incarceration.&quot; As in Lisk, this offender distributed pornographic 
  material in exchange for more pornographic material. The basis here was a two-for-one 
  exchange of pornographic material. The offender had over 12,000 images on his 
  server and received between 5,600 and 6,400 images over an eight-day period. 
  He sent out 2,800 to 3,200 images.</p>
<p>[3] Despite the fact that the respondent was a youthful first offender with 
  no prior record, this was an inappropriate case for a conditional sentence. 
  It called instead for a substantial reformatory sentence. However, in view of 
  the fact that the offender has already served seven and a half months of his 
  conditional sentence and that he has, with some difficulty, only recently obtained 
  an appointment for counseling at a psychiatric facility, we are reluctant to 
  interfere and impose a period of incarceration at this stage. </p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal from 
  sentence is dismissed. </p>
