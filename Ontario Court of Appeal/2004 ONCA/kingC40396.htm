<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The respondent received a conditional sentence of 21 months with strict 
  terms after his plea to a charge of touching a seven year-old girl for a sexual 
  purpose.</p>
<p>[2] The Crown argues that the trial judge failed to appreciate the seriousness 
  of this offence and, particularly, argued that he understated the nature of 
  the trust relationship breached by the respondent when he committed this offence. 
  We cannot agree with that submission. In our view, the trial judge's reasons 
  aptly describe the relationship between the two. He clearly took that trust 
  relationship into consideration in determining the appropriate sentence. </p>
<p>[3] We can find no error in principle. While some trial judges may have imposed 
  a jail term, we cannot say that the conditional sentence imposed by the trial 
  judge is manifestly unreasonable in all of the circumstances. Consequently, 
  leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
