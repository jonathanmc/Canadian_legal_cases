<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant pled guilty to a charge of touching a seven year-old girl 
  for a sexual purpose. A second charge of sexual assault based on the alleged 
  rape of the same child was withdrawn by the Crown. The plea was the result of 
  a plea bargain arrived at on the day of trial. It is clear that the appellant 
  was told that if he proceeded to trial on both counts and was convicted, he 
  would in all likelihood receive a significant jail term. He was told that if 
  he accepted the proposed plea bargain, there was a good chance that he would 
  receive a non-custodial term. The appellant was also told that ultimately, the 
  question of sentence would be for the judge. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant gave written instructions to his counsel advising him to proceed 
  with the guilty plea on the basis of the negotiations. After the appellant pled 
  guilty, the trial judge conducted a thorough inquiry into the plea. That inquiry 
  indicated that the plea was informed and voluntary. </p>
<p> [3] Subsequently, but before sentence, the appellant brought a motion to strike 
  his guilty plea before the trial judge. His counsel argued that the plea was 
  not voluntary. He relied on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the plea negotiations had been initiated by counsel without specific instructions 
    from the appellant;</li>
  <li>the plea bargain was arrived at on the day of trial and "sprung" on the 
    appellant shortly before the trial was to commence;</li>
  <li>the plea was put to the appellant as his best, if not only chance of avoiding 
    jail; and</li>
  <li>the appellant was told by a friend that if he went to jail on these charges, 
    he would in all likelihood suffer physical violence in jail.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [4] On the motion to strike the plea, the trial judge identified the legal principle 
  applicable where it is alleged that a plea is involuntary: see R. v. T.(R.) 
  (1992), 17 C.R. (4th) 247 (Ont. C.A.). The trial judge also referred to authority 
  which makes it clear that the inducements inherent in a plea negotiation do 
  not in and of themselves render a subsequent plea involuntary.</p>
<p>
  [5] We agree with the trial judge's description of the applicable legal principles. 
  The trial judge had the benefit of seeing and listening to the accused over 
  two days and was certainly in a much better position to assess the voluntariness 
  of his plea than this court is. There is no basis upon which we can interfere 
  with his conclusion that the plea was voluntary.</p>
<p>
  [6] The conviction appeal must be dismissed.</p>
