<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice David L. McWilliam of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 7, 2002, reported at [2002] O.J. No. 2324.</p>
<p>
  GILLESE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The City of Kingston operated a municipal dump site on the west shore of 
  the Cataraqui River, adjacent to Belle Island, from the early 1950s to the early 
  1970s. After the dump was closed, the City transformed the site into a recreation 
  area. The City did little to address the environmental problems created by the 
  dump site despite public demands for action and studies that showed that the 
  site was of serious concern.</p>
<p>
  [2] After testing samples of liquids emanating from the landfill site, Janet 
  Fletcher, an environmentalist, laid charges against the City by means of a private 
  citizen's information. In a separate action, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment 
  laid charges against the City and Mirka Januszkiewicz, the City's Director of 
  Environmental Services and Engineering.</p>
<p>
  [3] Following a twenty-five day trial, Justice of the Peace Bell convicted the 
  City of all four counts in the private information. He acquitted the City and 
  Ms. Januszkiewicz on the first count in the Ministry's action but convicted 
  them of the other three counts. </p>
<p>
  [4] On appeal, McWilliam J. of the Superior Court of Justice, allowed the appeals 
  against conviction of the City and Ms. Januszkiewicz and allowed the cross-appeal 
  against acquittal; he ordered a new trial on all counts. </p>
<p>
  [5] The Crown and Ms. Fletcher appeal on the basis that McWilliam J. erred in 
  his interpretation of s. 36(3) of the Fisheries Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-14. </p>
<p>
  [6] For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, restore the convictions 
  and restore the acquittal.</p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [7] The City of Kingston operated a municipal dump site on the west shore of 
  the Cataraqui River, adjacent to Belle Island, from the early 1950s to the early 
  1970s. The landfill was created in a marsh in the Cataraqui River and formed 
  a peninsula of garbage. After its closure, the landfill site was transformed 
  into a recreational area but little was done to address the possibility of leachate 
  generation and migration. </p>
<p>
  [8] Leachate is the term used to describe liquid that emanates from a site after 
  having percolated through it. At a landfill site, leachate is created when rainfall 
  percolates through the site's sandy overburden, dissolving some solids, mixing 
  with liquids and absorbing various gases from the underlying waste materials. 
  Leachate eventually comes to the surface in seeps and streams. Leachate can 
  also migrate with shallow groundwater. </p>
<p>
  [9] The charges in the instant case arise from alleged contaminants emanating 
  from the landfill site and entering the Cataraqui River. Ms. Fletcher laid charges 
  by means of a private citizen's information. The Ministry laid separate charges 
  by means of its own information. </p>
<p>
  [10] On four separate dates, Ms. Fletcher had samples taken of leachate entering 
  the Cataraqui River from the landfill site: December 5, 1996, December 8, 1996, 
  December 14, 1996 and December 17, 1996. These samples were collected from discharges 
  ten to fifteen feet from the bank of the Cataraqui River. The persons collecting 
  Ms. Fletcher's samples did not record the temperature of the leachate at the 
  time the samples were collected. </p>
<p>
  [11] The Fletcher samples were analysed for "acute lethality" to rainbow 
  trout fingerlings. Rainbow trout is the standard test species for this type 
  of analysis. Acute lethality testing normally involves the placing of test animals 
  in progressively more dilute concentrations of a sample material in order to 
  observe its effect upon them. It is meant to simulate what happens in the field. 
  If the sample material kills a sufficient number of test organisms during an 
  acute lethality test, one can conclude that the sample material is harmful to 
  the environment, fish life or fish habitat.</p>
<p> [12] Ms. Schroeder<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> conducted the acute 
  lethality tests of the Fletcher samples. These tests were performed in accordance 
  with the following Environment Canada protocol: "Biological Test Method: Reference 
  Method for Determining Acute Lethality of Effluents to Rainbow Trout, EPS 1/RM/13". 
  Following this protocol, the samples were aerated and heated to 15&ordm;C plus 
  or minus one degree. Aeration was accomplished by bubbling air through a sample 
  until the sample's oxygen level fell within the accepted range. </p>
<p>
  [13] The Fletcher samples were tested only at 100% concentration. All of the 
  trout fingerlings that were exposed to the Fletcher samples died within twenty-four 
  hours. Many of these fingerlings died within one hour. Ms. Schroeder testified 
  that the effluent collected in the Fletcher samples was acutely lethal to fish.</p>
<p> [14] As I have already noted, there is no record of the temperature of the 
  Fletcher samples at the time they were collected. However, during the course 
  of the acute lethality testing, the laboratory recorded the temperature and 
  pH<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> of the leachate solutions up to five 
  different times. The temperatures of the samples<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> 
  increased from 11&ordm;C to 14&ordm;C or 15&ordm;C over the course of the testing 
  process. Further, the pH increased from a range of 6.65 to 6.77 (when the samples 
  were received), to a range of 7.23 to 7.27 (when the fish died).</p>
<p>
  [15] Ms. Schroeder also tested the ammonia levels of the Fletcher samples. She 
  found that those ammonia levels were high enough to account for the mortality 
  of the fish.</p>
<p>
  [16] After being advised of the analysis results from the testing of the Fletcher 
  samples, the Ministry took its own samples of leachate from the landfill site 
  on four separate dates: February 7, 1997, February 10, 1997, February 19, 1997 
  and May 6, 1997. Some of the Ministry's samples were of the leachate discharge 
  as it entered the Cataraqui River and some were of the seep water itself. In 
  addition, upstream samples were taken in order to determine what the "background" 
  readings in the river would have been prior to the ingress of the leachate from 
  the site. </p>
<p>
  [17] The Ministry leachate samples from February 7, 1997 were taken both from 
  a depressed area right at the river's edge ("sample one") and from 
  an area of open water in the river that was a maximum of two metres from the 
  shore ("sample two"). </p>
<p>
  [18] The Ministry leachate samples from February 10, 1997 were taken at the 
  shoreline where the seepage mixed with the river and at the union of three different 
  rivulets that came out of the ground approximately 1.5 metres from the shoreline. 
  The temperature of the seep water at the point that it entered the river was 
  4&ordm;C. </p>
<p>
  [19] The Ministry leachate samples from February 19, 1997 were taken from the 
  same locations as those taken on February 10, 1997. On February 19, 1997, the 
  temperature of the seep water was 5&ordm;C. </p>
<p>
  [20] The Ministry leachate samples from May 6, 1997 were taken from a seep near 
  a creek about ninety-five paces upstream from where that creek flowed into the 
  Cataraqui River. Its temperature was measured at 6&ordm;C. </p>
<p>
  [21] The Ministry samples were submitted to a range of tests. The samples from 
  February 10, 1997 and February 19, 1997 were analysed for "acute lethality" 
  to rainbow trout and Daphnia magna, small crustaceans or water fleas used for 
  test purposes. The samples from May 6, 1997 were analysed for "acute lethality" 
  to Daphnia magna only. No acute lethality tests were performed with respect 
  to the Ministry samples from February 7, 1997. </p>
<p>
  [22] The Ministry's acute lethality tests involving rainbow trout were conducted 
  in accordance with the following Environment Canada protocols: "Biological 
  Test Method: Reference Method for Determining Acute Lethality of Effluents to 
  Rainbow Trout, EPS 1/RM/13" and "Biological Test Method: Acute Lethality 
  Test Using Rainbow Trout, EPS 1/RM/9". The Ministry's acute lethality tests 
  involving Daphnia magna were conducted in accordance with the following Environment 
  Canada protocol: "Biological Test Method: Reference Method for Determining 
  Acute Lethality of Effluents to Daphnia magna, EPS 1/RM/14". </p>
<p> [23] Mr. Lee<a href="#a">[4]</a><a name="4"></a> conducted the Ministry's 
  acute lethality tests involving rainbow trout. In accordance with the rainbow 
  trout protocols, prior to the commencement of each test, the sample under examination 
  was heated to 15&ordm;C and aerated until its oxygen level fell within the accepted 
  range. The samples were tested at a variety of concentrations.</p>
<p>
  [24] Mr. Lee testified that all rainbow trout exposed to at least a 25% concentration 
  of the leachate samples taken on February 10, 1997 and February 19, 1997 died 
  within twenty-four hours of the test, which was designed to run for four days. 
  All rainbow trout exposed to a 100% concentration of the leachate sample from 
  February 19, 1997 died within three minutes. None of the rainbow trout fingerlings 
  died when placed in the upstream samples. Mr. Lee testified that based on the 
  results from "acute lethality" testing involving rainbow trout of 
  the Ministry leachate samples from February 10, 1997 and February 19, 1997, 
  there was no doubt in his mind that the leachate was poisonous to aquatic life.</p>
<p> [25] Mr. Poirier<a href="#a">[5]</a><a name="5"></a> conducted the Ministry's 
  acute lethality tests involving Daphnia magna. In accordance with the Daphnia 
  magna protocol, prior to the commencement of each test, Mr. Poirier heated the 
  sample in question to 20&ordm;C. He agitated each sample thoroughly just prior 
  to testing. The samples were tested at a variety of concentrations.</p>
<p> [26] Mr. Poirier testified that based on the acute lethality tests that he 
  conducted on Daphnia magna, he concluded that the Ministry leachate samples 
  from February 10, 1997, February 19, 1997 and May 6, 1997 represented leachate 
  that was deleterious to fish. In addition, Mr. Poirier testified that only two 
  companies have ever submitted an effluent more toxic than the Ministry leachate 
  sample from February 10, 1997.<a href="#a">[6]</a><a name="6"></a> During the 
  test of that sample, 100% of the test organisms placed in that sample died within 
  the first fifteen minutes of the test, which was designed to run for two days. 
  When the leachate was diluted to a 60% concentration (60% effluent and 40% clean 
  water), 92% of the test organisms placed in it were dead within fifteen minutes. 
  When the leachate was diluted to 5% (with 95% clean water), 83% of the test 
  organisms placed in it were dead within forty-three hours. </p>
<p>
  [27] The Ministry leachate samples were analyzed for chemical parameters including 
  pH and ammonia. According to the chemical analyses of the leachate, the samples 
  from February 7, 1997 were shown to contain 93.8 mg/L of total ammonia and 8.6 
  mg/L of </p>
<p>
  total ammonia (samples "one" and "two" respectively), and 
  the sample from May 6, 1997 was shown to contain 31.3 mg/L of total ammonia. 
  By comparison, treated effluent from a sewage treatment plant would contain 
  total ammonia of only 10 to 15 mg/L. Mr. Lee testified that although the acceptable 
  total ammonia concentration for the protection of aquatic life varies with temperature 
  and pH, the very highest number not to be exceeded in any circumstances, according 
  to the guidelines of the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Task 
  Force, is 28.7 mg/L. Mr. Lee testified that the total ammonia values of the 
  Ministry effluent samples from February 7, 1997 and May 6, 1997 were high enough 
  to have been acutely lethal to fish.</p>
<p>
  [28] The Ministry leachate samples from February 10, 1997 and February 19, 1997 
  were both shown to contain 127.7 mg/L of total ammonia. Mr. Lee determined that 
  the ammonia concentrations in those two samples were at a level that would cause 
  acute lethality to fish.</p>
<p>
  [29] All the experts at trial agreed that ammonia was the main toxicant rendering 
  the samples acutely lethal. Ammonia is a naturally occurring substance which, 
  at certain concentration levels, is necessary for life. Ammonia is composed 
  of unionized ammonia (NH3) and ionized ammonia (NH4+). Unionized ammonia is 
  much more toxic than ionized ammonia. The proportion of a solution of total 
  ammonia that is composed of unionized ammonia increases as the temperature and/or 
  pH of the solution increases. Further, the pH of a solution will rise as a result 
  of vigorous shaking and/or aeration. </p>
<p>
  [30] Some species of fish are more sensitive to unionized ammonia than others. 
  Pink salmon is the species that is most sensitive to unionized ammonia; rainbow 
  trout is the second most sensitive species. The fact that some species are more 
  sensitive to unionized ammonia than others means that the minimum concentration 
  level of unionized ammonia that will be toxic depends upon the species of fish 
  concerned. </p>
<p>
  [31] On the Fletcher information, the City was convicted of four counts of unlawfully 
  depositing or permitting the deposit of a deleterious substance in the Cataraqui 
  River, contrary to s. 36(3) of the Fisheries Act, and thereby committing an 
  offence contrary to s. 40(2)(a) of that Act. Each count related to a separate 
  day on which samples of the leachate had been collected.</p>
<p>
  [32] On the Crown information, the City and Ms. Januszkiewicz were convicted 
  of three of four counts under ss. 36(3) and 40(2)(a) of the Fisheries Act. They 
  were acquitted on the count relating to the Ministry leachate samples collected 
  on February 7, 1997.</p>
<p>
  [33] On summary conviction appeal, the convictions and the acquittal were set 
  aside and a new trial was ordered. The Crown and Ms. Fletcher appeal from the 
  decision of the appeal judge. </p>
<p>
  [34] Pollution Probe was granted leave to intervene in this appeal as a friend 
  of the court. Specifically, Pollution Probe was granted intervenor status with 
  respect to the nature, scope and applicability of the precautionary principle 
  as an aid to the interpretation of the Fisheries Act. </p>
<p>
  THE TRIAL DECISION </p>
<p>
  [35] The trial judge had no difficulty in finding that the City created and 
  owned the landfill site, was responsible for the site's ongoing operation and 
  maintenance, and had deposited or permitted the deposit of a substance in the 
  Cataraqui River, which was water frequented by fish. As the trial judge noted, 
  the issue that was "hotly contested" was whether the substance in 
  question - the leachate - was deleterious. </p>
<p>
  [36] In determining whether the leachate was deleterious, the trial judge adopted 
  the test enunciated in R. v. MacMillan Bloedel (Alberni) Ltd. (1979), 47 C.C.C. 
  (2d) 118 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1979] 1 S.C.R. xi, 
  holding that the prosecution need only prove that the substance introduced was 
  deleterious or harmful to fish. </p>
<p>
  [37] The trial judge found that the main toxicant that rendered the samples 
  acutely lethal "was generally agreed to be ammonia" of which "the 
  unionized form was accepted as the most toxic." He found that the samples 
  that had been chemically analysed confirmed the presence of high ammonia concentrations. 
  </p>
<p>
  [38] At trial, the City and Ms. Januszkiewicz argued that the prosecution had 
  failed to prove that the leachate was deleterious. Among other things, they 
  argued that the pH of the samples had changed between the time the samples were 
  taken and the time they were tested, with the result that the toxicity of the 
  samples had increased when the acute lethality tests were performed. The trial 
  judge rejected this argument on the basis that the testing methodology used 
  by the Crown and Ms. Fletcher had "widespread scientific support", 
  was "fair and impartial" and had been carried out objectively. He 
  characterized the defence argument as "entirely theoretical". The 
  court also noted that the defence had not put forward an in situ sample for 
  analysis.</p>
<p>
  [39] The trial judge refused to convict on the first count in the Ministry information 
  because of confusion over the date of the chemical analysis of the Ministry 
  sample from February 7, 1997, explaining, "in this confused state, the 
  benefit will go to the Defence."</p>
<p>
  [40] The court rejected the due diligence defence. Relying on R. v. Sault Ste. 
  Marie (City), [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, the trial judge stated that the defence 
  of due diligence involves the characterization of efforts taken to prevent the 
  act or event, including the history of the defendants' efforts for a reasonable 
  period before the charge dates. He found that both the City and Ms. Januszkiewicz 
  were aware that the leachate was flowing into the Cataraqui River and that they 
  chose to ignore the problem. </p>
<p>
  [41] He concluded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he Court rejects the defendants' position that they were duly diligent in 
  respect to preventing the discharges. The Court can find no evidence of a comprehensive 
  plan, not even one of effective monitoring of the closed landfill site to detect 
  discharges. Certainly, no effective resources were committed to even dealing 
  with the problems on a haphazard basis. </p>
<p>
  [42] The court imposed a fine of $30,000 on each of the four privately laid 
  counts and made one half of the fine payable to Ms. Fletcher and one half payable 
  to the Minister of Finance for the Canadian government. The City was given ninety 
  days to pay. Also, the City was ordered to forward to Ms. Fletcher fifteen copies 
  of the final report by Malroz Engineering Inc., an engineering company retained 
  by the City to implement interim seep management measures and conduct a comprehensive 
  environmental site characterization, no later than October 31, 1999 or fifteen 
  days after its presentation to city council, whichever date was sooner. </p>
<p>
  [43] With regard to the prosecution brought by the Ministry against the City, 
  the court ordered a fine of $10,000 for each of counts two, three and four, 
  totalling $30,000, to be paid within ninety days. </p>
<p>
  [44] Ms. Januszkiewicz was given a suspended sentence in respect of her convictions 
  on the Ministry information. The sentencing judge reasoned that a suspended 
  sentence was appropriate because other "authors of this misfortune" 
  were not before the court and, although Ms. Januszkiewicz was "not entirely 
  blameless", she was "in the wrong place at the wrong time".</p>
<p>
  [45] Further, the City was ordered to: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Within three months provide the Ministry with a rationalized long-term site 
  monitoring program indicating whether more or fewer monitoring wells will be 
  required and whether greater or lesser frequency of the sampling will be necessary. 
  The program description should also indicate how future uses of the site may 
  be affected by the presence of contaminants disclosed on sampling and analysis[.]</p>
<p>
  In addition, the City was ordered to, within twelve months,</p>
<p>
  provide the Ministry with a plan for the capping of the site in accordance with 
  current standards of practice period&#133;. This plan shall involve the evaluation 
  and upgrading of the current cover at the site by the placing of impervious 
  material such as clay to an adequate depth, a site maintenance program involving 
  continuous evaluation of the integrity of the cap, that is, there is a plan 
  for the maintenance program, an inspection program for any seeps, and a contingency 
  plan to deal with any seeps that are found, a surface water management plan 
  addressing both the cap's integrity and the flow quantity and directions of 
  water shed by the cap, and a detailed plan for controlled venting of gases generated 
  by the landfill beneath the impervious cover.</p>
<p>
  THE SUMMARY CONVICTION APPEAL </p>
<p>
  [46] The City appealed against conviction and sentence and Ms. Januszkiewicz 
  appealed against conviction. The Crown cross-appealed the acquittal on count 
  one of the Ministry information and appealed the sentence for both the City 
  and Ms. Januszkiewicz.</p>
<p>
  [47] The appeal judge held that the trial judge erred in applying the test in 
  MacMillan Bloedel to the question of whether the leachate was deleterious. In 
  his opinion, the appropriate test was that set out in R. v. Inco Ltd. (2001), 
  155 C.C.C. (3d) 383 (Ont. C.A.). He reasoned as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I also see no useful policy reason to find a dichotomy exists between the interpretations 
  given to s. 30(1) of the Ontario Water Resources Act in Inco and s. 36(3) of 
  the Fisheries Act given in MacMillan Bloedel. The "two-tier" test 
  offered by Chief Justice McMurtry in Inco assists in interpreting "a deleterious 
  substance" in s. 36(3) since both the provincial and federal statutes deal, 
  essentially, with "impairing water quality," either per se or those 
  waters "frequented by fish." Consequently unless ammonia was established 
  to be an inherently toxic substance, it would be necessary in my view under 
  s. 36(3) "to consider the quantity and concentration of the discharges 
  as well as the time frame over which the discharge took place." I do not 
  see in the trial judge's reasons that those factors were taken into account 
  in assessing all of the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [48] The appeal judge concluded that a new trial was necessary. Having allowed 
  the appeal on convictions and concluded that the wrong legal standard had been 
  applied at trial, he held that the Crown ought to succeed in its cross?appeal 
  of the acquittal on count one of the Ministry information. </p>
<p>
  ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [49] The main issue to be determined in this appeal is the proper interpretation 
  of s. 36(3) of the Fisheries Act. </p>
<p>
  [50] In essence, the appellant argues that the offence created by s. 36(3) is 
  made out by proof that a substance discharged into waters frequented by fish 
  is "deleterious" within the meaning of the Act. The appellant Fletcher 
  relies on that argument and, additionally, asks this court to decide whether 
  it is sufficient to show that a substance is acutely lethal to fish to be considered 
  "deleterious" under the Act, whether or not the substance is "inherently 
  toxic". </p>
<p>
  [51] The respondents, on the other hand, maintain that to make out the offence 
  under s. 36(3), the prosecution must also prove that the substance impairs the 
  receiving water thereby making it deleterious to fish. </p>
<p>
  [52] In addition, the respondent City submits that the trial judge (1) failed 
  to properly determine whether the appellants had proven beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that the leachate was "toxic" or "deleterious"; (2) 
  failed to consider significant relevant evidence; or (3) erred in holding that 
  the prosecution need not prove that the leachate was deleterious to fish that 
  frequented the Cataraqui River. Further, the respondent Januszkiewicz submits 
  that there was no evidence that the effluent collected in the Ministry sample 
  from May 6, 1997 flowed from the seep where it was collected into the Cataraqui 
  River.</p>
<p>
  [53] In the event that it is successful on appeal, the Crown asks this court 
  to substitute a conviction with respect to count one of the Ministry information.</p>
<p>
  THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS</p>
<p>
  [54] Subsections 34(1) and 36(3) of the Fisheries Act are the key provisions 
  engaged by this appeal. They are set out below. As reference is frequently made 
  to s. 30(1) of the Ontario Water Resources Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.40 ("OWRA"), 
  it too is set out below. </p>
<p>
  [55] Subsection 36(3) of the Fisheries Act is contained within that part of 
  the statute that is headed "Fish Habitat Protection and Pollution Prevention". 
  It provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Subject to subsection (4) [deposits authorized by regulation], no person shall 
  deposit or permit the deposit of a deleterious substance of any type in water 
  frequented by fish or in any place under any conditions where the deleterious 
  substance or any other deleterious substance that results from the deposit of 
  the deleterious substance may enter any such water. </p>
<p>
  [56] Subsection 34(1) defines the term "deleterious substance". The 
  relevant part of s. 34(1) provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  For the purposes of sections 35 to 43, "deleterious substance" means: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) any substance that, if added to any water, would degrade or alter or form 
  part of a process of degradation or alteration of the quality of that water 
  so that it is rendered or is likely to be rendered deleterious to fish or fish 
  habitat or to the use by man of fish that frequent that water[.]</p>
<p>
  [57] Subsection 30(1) of the OWRA provides that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Every person that discharges or causes or permits the discharge of any material 
  of any kind into or in any waters or on any shore or bank thereof or into or 
  in any place that may impair the quality of the water of any waters is guilty 
  of an offence.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [58] With respect, in my view the appeal judge erred in applying the test set 
  out in Inco to the question of whether the leachate was deleterious for the 
  purposes of s. 36(3) of the Fisheries Act. The Inco test was established in 
  reference to s. 30(1) of the OWRA. As discussed more fully below, the wording 
  of s. 36(3) is markedly different than that of s. 30(1). Moreover, the scope 
  and purposes of the two pieces of legislation is different. Unlike the OWRA, 
  a piece of provincial legislation that focuses on Ontario waters, the Fisheries 
  Act is federal legislation that applies to all waters in the fishing zones of 
  Canada, all waters in the territorial sea of Canada and all internal waters 
  of Canada. </p>
<p>
  [59] The Supreme Court of Canada has provided clear guidance on the approach 
  to be followed when interpreting legislation: read the words of the provision 
  in context. That is, the words of a provision are to be interpreted by giving 
  them their ordinary and grammatical meaning when read in harmony with the scheme, 
  intent and object of the legislation: see, for example, Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo 
  Shoes Ltd., [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 at 40; R. v. Sharpe, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45 at para. 
  74 - 5. </p>
<p>
  [60] Subsection 36(3) of the Fisheries Act, reproduced again below for ease 
  of reference, prohibits persons from (1) depositing or permitting the deposit 
  of (2) a deleterious substance of any type (3) in water frequented by fish or 
  in any place where the deleterious substance may enter such water.</p>
<p>
  Subject to subsection (4) [deposits authorized by regulation], no person shall 
  deposit or permit the deposit of a deleterious substance of any type in water 
  frequented by fish or in any place under any conditions where the deleterious 
  substance or any other deleterious substance that results from the deposit of 
  the deleterious substance may enter any such water [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [61] In this case, subsection (4) is not relevant.</p>
<p>
  [62] In s. 34(1)(a), "deleterious substance" is defined as: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) any substance that, if added to any water, would degrade or alter or form 
  part of a process of degradation or alteration of the quality of that water 
  so that it is rendered or is likely to be rendered deleterious to fish or fish 
  habitat or to the use by man of fish that frequent that water.</p>
<p>
  [63] On an ordinary and plain reading of paragraph (a), a substance is deleterious 
  if, when added to any water, it would alter the quality of the water such that 
  it is likely to render the water deleterious to fish, fish habitat or to the 
  use by man of fish that frequent the water. There is no stipulation in paragraph 
  (a) that the substance must be proven to be deleterious to the receiving water. 
  There is no reference to the receiving water in paragraph (a). On the contrary, 
  the language makes it clear that the substance is deleterious if, when added 
  to any water, it degrades or alters the quality of the water to which it has 
  been added. The "any water" referred to in paragraph (a) is not the 
  receiving water. Rather, it is any water to which the impugned substance is 
  added, after which it can be determined whether the quality of that water is 
  rendered deleterious to fish, fish habitat or the use by man of fish that frequent 
  that water. </p>
<p>
  [64] I agree with the interpretation of s. 36(3) given by Seaton J.A. in MacMillan 
  Bloedel. As he noted at pp. 121?22: "What is being defined is the substance 
  that is added to the water, rather than the water after the addition of the 
  substance." </p>
<p>
  [65] The focus of s. 36(3) is on the substance being added to water frequented 
  by fish. It prohibits the deposit of a deleterious substance in such water. 
  It does not prohibit the deposit of a substance that causes the receiving water 
  to become deleterious. It is the substance that is added to water frequented 
  by fish that is defined, not the water after the addition of the substance. 
  A deleterious substance does not have to render the water into which it is introduced 
  poisonous or harmful to fish; it need only be likely to render the water deleterious 
  to fish. The actus reus is the deposit of a deleterious substance into water 
  frequented by fish. There is no requirement in s. 36(3) or paragraph (a) of 
  the definition of the term "deleterious substance" in s. 34(1), of 
  proof that the receiving waters are deleterious to fish. </p>
<p>
  [66] In R. v. Northwest Falling Contractors Ltd., [1980] 2 S.C.R. 292, the Supreme 
  Court of Canada considered the constitutional validity of s. 33(2) [now s. 36(3)] 
  of the Fisheries Act. In that case, the appellant was charged with violating 
  s. 33(2) as a result of diesel fuel having spilled into tidal waters. In the 
  course of explaining why the provision was constitutionally valid, the Court 
  opined both on the purpose of the legislation and the meaning of s. 33(2). It 
  made the following six pertinent observations at pp. 300?01. (1) Fish, as defined 
  in the legislation, are part of the system that constitutes the fisheries resource. 
  The power to control and regulate that resource must include the authority to 
  protect all those creatures that form part of that system. (2) The legislation 
  is aimed at the protection and preservation of fisheries as a public resource. 
  (3) The provision is concerned with the deposit of deleterious substances in 
  water frequented by fish or in a place where the deleterious substance may enter 
  such water. (4) The definition of a deleterious substance is related to the 
  substance being deleterious to fish. (5) The subsection seeks to protect fisheries 
  by preventing substances deleterious to fish from entering into waters frequented 
  by fish. (6) The provision is restricted to a prohibition of deposits that threaten 
  fish, fish habitat or the use of fish by man. </p>
<p>
  [67] In my view, the interpretation of s. 36(3) given in MacMillan Bloedel is 
  consonant with the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in Northwest Falling 
  Contractors. Accordingly, I reject the respondents' contention that the Supreme 
  Court of Canada has, by means of its decision in Northwest Falling Contractors, 
  directed the courts to consider the effect of the deposit on the receiving water 
  by means of a consideration of the toxicity of the substance and the circumstances 
  of the discharge. </p>
<p>
  [68] Those lower courts in Ontario that have followed the reasoning in MacMillan 
  Bloedel, in my opinion, have done so correctly. See, for example, R. v. Cyanamid 
  Canada Inc. (1981), 11 C.E.L.R. 31 at 36?37 (Ont. Prov. Ct. (Crim. Div.)); R. 
  v. Ontario (Ministry of the Environment), [2001] O.J. No. 2581 at paras. 163?71 
  (Ct. J.); R. v. Jackson (2002), 48 C. E.L.R. (N.S.) 259 at 264 (Ont. Sup. Ct.) 
  </p>
<p>
  [69] The appellant Fletcher asks this court to determine whether, for the purposes 
  of a prosecution under s. 36(3) under the Fisheries Act, a substance will be 
  considered deleterious if it is shown that the substance is acutely lethal to 
  fish. The question, as phrased, cannot be answered because it provides insufficient 
  information -- it does not speak to all of the requirements of paragraph (a) 
  of the definition of the term "deleterious substance" in s. 34(1). 
  Paragraph (a) requires proof that the substance, if added to water, alters the 
  quality of the water so that the water is likely to be rendered deleterious 
  to fish. I would add, however, that if a substance, when added to water, alters 
  the water so that the water is acutely lethal to fish, I am of the view that 
  the substance is deleterious. </p>
<p>
  [70] The respondents argue that although the Crown does not have to prove actual 
  harm or damage to fish or fish habitat when the substance in question is inherently 
  toxic, when the substance is not inherently toxic the Crown must prove that 
  the substance is deleterious at the point it enters the receiving environment. 
  It will be recalled that the trial judge found that ammonia was the main toxicant 
  within the leachate. Ammonia is a naturally occurring substance that can be 
  beneficial and which dissipates quickly in water. This, they argue, necessarily 
  leads to a consideration of the nature and circumstances of the discharge including 
  the length of time over which the discharge occurred and the nature, quality, 
  quantity and concentration of material discharged. </p>
<p>
  [71] In my view, the essence of the respondents' argument is that the proper 
  test to be applied where the substance is not inherently toxic is that given 
  by this court in Inco. </p>
<p>
  [72] In Inco, the defendant was alleged to have permitted effluent containing 
  high levels of nickel and iron to be discharged into a river. Charges were laid 
  against the defendant under s. 30(1) of the OWRA. Subsection 30(1) of the OWRA, 
  reproduced again for ease of reference, provides that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Every person that discharges or causes or permits the discharge of any material 
  of any kind into or in any waters or on any shore or bank thereof or into or 
  in any place that may impair the quality of the water of any waters is guilty 
  of an offence [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [73] As can be seen, s. 30(1) expressly provides that a person who permits the 
  discharge of material into water is guilty of an offence if the discharge "may 
  impair the quality of the water", that is, the water into which the material 
  was discharged.</p>
<p>
  [74] McMurtry C.J.O., writing for the court in Inco, held that the test established 
  in R. v. Imperial Oil Ltd. (1995), 17 C.E.L.R. (N.S.) 12 (Ont. Ct. J. (Prov. 
  Div.)) should be applied when determining whether an offence under s. 30(1) 
  has been made out. At p. 405, he said this: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Inherently toxic substances will always fail that test, reflecting zero-tolerance 
  for discharging materials that, by their nature, may impair water quality. If 
  the material in the discharge is not inherently toxic, then it will be necessary 
  to consider the quantity and concentration of the discharge as well as the time 
  frame over which the discharge took place. &#133;</p>
<p>
  Subsection 30(1) prohibits the discharge into water of materials that may impair 
  the quality of any waters [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [75] In a prosecution pursuant to s. 30(1) of the OWRA, the prosecution must 
  establish that the substance discharged into water has the potential to impair 
  the quality of the water into which it was discharged. In a prosecution pursuant 
  to s. 36(3) of the Fisheries Act, what must be proven is that a substance discharged 
  into water frequented by fish is deleterious. The elements of the two offences 
  are different because the language of the offence?creating provisions is different. 
  In my view, it would be incorrect to apply a test established for prosecutions 
  under s. 30(1) of the OWRA to charges brought pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Fisheries 
  Act. </p>
<p>
  [76] For this reason, I am of the view that the appeal judge erred not only 
  in making the test under s. 36(3) of the Fisheries Act the same as that under 
  s. 30(1) of the OWRA but also by holding that the trial judge should have made 
  a finding of fact as to whether the leachate was inherently toxic. </p>
<p>
  [77] Site-specific impairment is not a necessary ingredient of the offence under 
  s. 36(3). Although the second step of the test formulated by this court in Inco 
  relates to substances that are not inherently toxic, the test does not apply 
  to prosecutions under s. 36(3). It applies to prosecutions taken under s. 30(1) 
  of the OWRA, a provision that does focus on impairment of the quality of the 
  receiving water. It may be that one method for proving that a substance, when 
  added to water, renders that water deleterious to fish is through an examination 
  of the nature of the substance and the quantities and concentrations in which 
  it was discharged. However, that does not make such considerations a necessary 
  component of the offence under s. 36(3); rather, it provides a possible form 
  of proof.</p>
<p>
  [78] Accordingly, in my view, ss. 36(3) and 34(1) cannot be taken as requiring 
  the Crown to prove the nature of the allegedly deleterious substance. The prohibition 
  in s. 36(3) is against the deposit of a deleterious substance "of any type". 
  What must be proven is that the substance, whatever it might be, is a deleterious 
  substance within the meaning of paragraph (a) of the definition of that term 
  in s. 34(1). In this case, it meant that the prosecution had to prove that the 
  leachate, when added to any water, was likely to render the water deleterious 
  to fish or fish habitat or to the use by man of fish that frequent the water. 
  It did not have to prove which component of the leachate was responsible for 
  the degradation or alteration of the quality of the water such that the water 
  was likely to be rendered deleterious to fish. Nor was it obliged to show that 
  fish living in the vicinity of the seep were harmed. It was required only to 
  prove the elements of the offence as set out above. </p>
<p>
  [79] To the extent that R. v. Pacifica Papers Inc. (2002), 46 C.E.L.R. (N.S.) 
  93 (B.C. Prov. Ct.), R. v. BHP Diamonds Inc., [2002] N.W.T.J. No. 91 (N.W.T.S.C.) 
  and R. v. Abitibi Consolidated Inc, [2000] N.J. No. 153 (Newf. Prov. Ct.), cases 
  relied upon by the respondents, stand for the proposition that when a substance 
  is not inherently deleterious, the substance's nature and concentration must 
  be proven to be deleterious at the point it enters the receiving environment, 
  I am in respectful disagreement. </p>
<p>
  APPLICATION TO THE CASE AT BAR </p>
<p>
  [80] As the appeal judge applied an incorrect legal test when considering the 
  judgment of the trial judge, it falls to this court to determine whether the 
  trial judge erred in concluding that the elements of the offences alleged under 
  s. 36(3) had been made out. It will be recalled that the elements of the offence 
  to be proven under s. 36(3) are: (1) depositing or permitting the deposit of 
  (2) a deleterious substance (3) in water frequented by fish or where the substance 
  may enter such water. </p>
<p>
  [81] On the record, there can be no doubt that the trial judge was entirely 
  justified in finding that the respondents had deposited waste in the dump site; 
  that when it rained, some part of the waste or its residue combined with rain 
  water to become leachate; that the leachate seeped into the Cataraqui River; 
  and, that the Cataraqui River is frequented by fish. In the language of s. 36(3), 
  the trial judge was entitled to find that the respondents permitted the deposit 
  of leachate into water frequented by fish. </p>
<p>
  [82] Did the trial judge err in concluding that the leachate was a deleterious 
  substance within the meaning of the definition of that term in s. 34(1)(a)? 
  That is, did the trial judge err in concluding that the leachate, if added to 
  any water, would alter the quality of that water so that the water was likely 
  rendered deleterious to fish? </p>
<p>
  [83] The Ministry's acute lethality tests were performed on the Ministry samples 
  at a variety of concentrations. The diluted concentrations were made by adding 
  the leachate to a proportionate amount of water. Given the trial judge's acceptance 
  of the protocols employed and the test results on the diluted Ministry samples, 
  I see no error in his conclusion that the leachate contained in those samples 
  was a deleterious substance within the meaning of paragraph (a) of the definition 
  of that term in s. 34(1).</p>
<p>
  [84] The tests of the Fletcher samples were performed only on the samples at 
  100 per cent concentration. In other words, the Fletcher leachate samples were 
  not added to water. The trial judge did not directly address the question of 
  whether the Fletcher samples, if added to water, would have altered the quality 
  of the water thereby rendering it deleterious to fish. The evidence on that 
  point is unclear. On the record before this court, I cannot conclude beyond 
  a reasonable doubt that, had the Fletcher leachate samples been added to water, 
  the water would have been rendered deleterious to fish. As a consequence, the 
  appeal in relation to the Fletcher prosecution must fail. </p>
<p>
  [85] The intervenor Pollution Probe submits that s. 36(3) must be interpreted 
  in light of the "precautionary principle". It cites 114957 Canada 
  Lt&eacute;e v. Hudson (Town), [2001] 2 S.C.R. 241 ("114957 Canada") 
  in support of this submission. 114957 Canada concerned the interpretation of 
  s. 410(1) of the Qu&eacute;bec Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q. c. C-19. The Supreme 
  Court held that this provision granted a municipality the authority to adopt 
  a by-law that restricted the use of pesticides within the municipality's territorial 
  limits. L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; J., on behalf of the majority of the Court, noted 
  that the Court's interpretation of s. 410(1) was consistent with the "precautionary 
  principle", a principle of international law and policy. L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; 
  J. explained at pp. 266-67 that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The interpretation of By-law 270 contained in these reasons respects international 
  law's "precautionary principle", which is defined as follows at para. 
  7 of the Bergen Ministerial Declaration on Sustainable Development (1990): </p>
<p class="indent">
  In order to achieve sustainable development, policies must be based on the precautionary 
  principle. Environmental measures must anticipate, prevent and attack the causes 
  of environmental degradation. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible 
  damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for 
  postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation.</p>
<p>
  [86] 114957 Canada indicates that the values reflected by the "precautionary 
  principle" may help inform the contextual approach to statutory interpretation. 
  However, the meaning of s. 36(3) of the Fisheries Act is clear and unambiguous. 
  As a consequence, there is no need to resort to the "precautionary principle" 
  as an interpretive guide to the legislative text in question. I note merely 
  that the interpretation of s. 36(3) contained in these reasons is not inconsistent 
  with the "precautionary principle" established under international 
  law.</p>
<p>
  THE ADDITIONAL ISSUES RAISED BY THE RESPONDENTS</p>
<p>
  [87] The respondent City raises three additional issues in support of their 
  submission that the appeal should be dismissed. The respondent Januszkiewicz 
  raises a fourth additional issue. I will consider each issue in turn.</p>
<p>
  A) Reasonable doubt</p>
<p>
  [88] The respondent City submits that the trial judge erred by failing to determine 
  whether the appellants had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the leachate 
  contained in the samples was deleterious to fish. I do not accept this submission. 
  Under the heading "THE ACTUS REA OF THE CHARGES", the trial judge 
  explicitly considered whether the leachate contained in the samples was deleterious 
  to fish. He concluded that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In summary, seven of the eight counts in the charges against the defendants 
  are ruled to be deleterious to fish. The argument made by the defence on these 
  seven charges concerned specifically with this element of the offence are not 
  given credence for the above stated reasons.</p>
<p>
  [89] The respondents had argued that the results of the acute lethality tests 
  failed to establish that the leachate contained in the samples was deleterious 
  to fish. They argued that the animals used in the acute lethality tests died 
  not as a result of the toxicity of the leachate contained in the samples, but 
  instead as a result of the manner in which the tests were conducted. The trial 
  judge considered this argument and rejected it, concluding that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  By happenstance, in looking at all of the data, the Court does not agree with 
  the Defence's arguments on support of the pH shift as causing the deaths in 
  the bioassays. The argument of the defence is entirely theoretical and scientific 
  experts who wish to overturn accepted science, in this Court's opinion, have 
  to do more than testify in Court.</p>
<p>
  [90] Under the heading "REASONABLE DOUBT ISSUE", the trial judge cited 
  Cory J.'s statement in R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc. (1991), 84 D.L.R. (4th) 
  161 at 227 that "[t]he Crown must still prove the actus reus of regulatory 
  offences beyond a reasonable doubt." He concluded that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Court, after analysing the data presented, considering the arguments put 
  forth by both sides and consulting the relevant case law rejects the reasonable 
  possibilities at issue and has no reasonable doubts as to the commission of 
  the actus reus in seven of the eight charges as outlined above. </p>
<p>
  [91] Given the trial judge's explicit statements on this element of the offence 
  and the issue of reasonable doubt, it is apparent that the trial judge found 
  that the appellants had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the leachate contained 
  in the samples was deleterious to fish. The arguments of the respondents concerning 
  the manner in which the acute lethality tests were conducted failed to establish 
  a reasonable doubt. I conclude that the trial judge committed no error of law 
  with respect to this issue.</p>
<p>
  B) Consideration of significant relevant evidence </p>
<p>
  [92] The respondent City argues that the trial judge failed to consider significant 
  relevant evidence. Where a trial record, including the reasons for judgment, 
  discloses a lack of appreciation of relevant evidence, an appellate court must 
  intercede: Harper v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 2 at 14. The respondent City 
  claims that there are a number of issues that the trial judge either failed 
  to address or failed to address sufficiently. All of these issues relate to 
  the respondents' argument that the animals that died during the acute lethality 
  tests on the samples died not as a result of the toxicity of the leachate contained 
  in the samples, but instead as a result of the manner in which the acute lethality 
  tests were conducted. </p>
<p>
  [93] I do not accept this submission. This was a very difficult trial. As the 
  trial judge noted in his reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This was a long trial, twenty-five court days with almost no admitted facts 
  into evidence. Consequently, many witnesses were necessary to establish the 
  legality of a chain of evidence for the samples, the analysis, the charts and 
  exhibits - two hundred and twenty-seven exhibits in all. There were frequent 
  points of law debated. Case law citations numbered over fifty. Ten expert witnesses 
  testified on opposing theories of the key elements of the charges and the Court 
  frequently had to readjust its focus from particular arguments to the overview, 
  that is, the forest was frequently disguised because of the trees. </p>
<p>
  [94] In spite of these difficulties, the trial judge gave careful consideration 
  to the issue of whether the leachate samples were deleterious to fish. The respondents 
  argued at trial that the samples would not have been found to have been acutely 
  lethal if they had been tested in situ rather than in accordance with Environment 
  Canada protocols on acute lethality testing. The trial found that this argument 
  was "entirely theoretical" and contrary to accepted science. The respondents 
  also argued at trial that the acute lethality tests were not performed in accordance 
  with Environment Canada protocols. The trial judge responded to this claim as 
  follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Defence suggested that Drs. Lee and Poirier made errors in their methodology 
  of testing using some quotes from various protocols. However, a careful reading 
  of the whole methodology of the protocols revealed that phrases were taken out 
  of context and the Court was satisfied with the counter arguments and confident 
  that the test methodology was fair and impartial.</p>
<p>
  A special interpretation of the protocol was proposed by counsellor Doody [counsel 
  for the City] as proof of the unreliability of the Ministry of the Environment 
  laboratory methods. Immediately after the death of the organisms in the effluent, 
  the lab is to conduct temperature and pH measurements. The impracticality and 
  cost of such an interpretation, that is, to have an observer oversee a sample 
  for forty-eight hours to comply with these requests, illustrates a special twist 
  the Defence liked to put on their arguments. The evidence is that all tests 
  are conducted under the same methodology with observations made at timed intervals. 
  </p>
<p>
  [95] Although the trial judge's reasons are not exhaustive, his reasons nevertheless 
  demonstrate a full understanding of the complex issues of scientific evidence 
  that were before him. I therefore conclude that the record does not disclose 
  a lack of appreciation of relevant evidence. </p>
<p>
  C) Proof that the leachate was deleterious to fish that frequent the Cataraqui 
  River</p>
<p>
  [96] The respondent City submits that the trial judge erred in holding that 
  the appellants need not prove that the leachate was deleterious to fish that 
  frequent the Cataraqui River. I do not accept this submission. For the reasons 
  already given, proof that the substance in question is deleterious to the specific 
  species of fish that frequent the water in which the substance is deposited 
  is not an element of the offence in s. 36(3) of the Fisheries Act. </p>

  D) The Ministry leachate sample from May 6, 1997</p>
<p>
  [97] The respondent Januszkiewicz submits that the trial judge erred in convicting 
  the respondents on count four of the Ministry information because there was 
  no evidence that the leachate collected in the Ministry sample from May 6, 1997 
  flowed from the seep where it was collected into the nearby creek, nor was there 
  evidence that the effluent could have entered the Cataraqui River even if it 
  had reached the creek. This submission is without merit. The trial judge found 
  that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Sierra Legal Defence Fund video, which is Exhibit 7, along with evidence 
  of all the samplers characterize the leachate as coming from the ground in the 
  form of seeps or springs running across the ground and into the shore of the 
  river. In some cases where the flow was heavy, channels were cut down to the 
  foreshore to look like small streams. Many of the photographs entered as exhibits 
  also show this situation. Frank Crossley, the Ministry of the Environment's 
  Hydrogeologist, an expert on the movement of ground water through the subsurface, 
  commented that the leachate is formed when the water moves through the soluble 
  materials of the underlying landfill then migrates horizontally in a radial 
  pattern from the high ground to about one metre elevation above the river level. 
  He calculates that the flow from data in the Hill Report as much as twenty tanker 
  loads a day, that's 200,000 litres. Malroz, the company retained by the City 
  of Kingston in March 1997 adopted a remedial action of driving sheet pilings 
  along the periphery to capture the leachate flows and pumping to the sanitary 
  sewer system. </p>
<p>
  From the massive evidence before the Court, it seems impossible to dispute this 
  element of the offence. The leachate or toxic solution from the landfill site 
  enters the Cataraqui River at the time of these charges.</p>
<p>
  [98] The Ministry sample from May 6, 1997 contained leachate that was emanating 
  from the dump site. The trial judge found that leachate from the dump site was 
  entering the Cataraqui River at the time this sample was collected. Ms. Januszkiewicz 
  offers no argument that there was any difference between the leachate collected 
  by the Ministry on May 6, 1997 and the "tanker loads" of leachate 
  that flowed into the Cataraqui River on that day. I conclude that the trial 
  judge made no error in this regard.</p>
<p>
  THE ACQUITTAL ON COUNT ONE OF THE MINISTRY INFORMATION</p>
<p>
  [99] The appellants maintain that had the appeal judge applied the proper test 
  to count one of the Ministry information, he would have set aside the acquittal 
  and entered a conviction. I disagree. </p>
<p>
  [100] This court is to defer to findings of fact at first instance absent "a 
  palpable and overriding error": see Housen v. Nikolaisen (2002), 211 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 577 at 582. The trial judge found that the Crown's evidence concerning 
  the Ministry samples from February 7, 1997 - specifically, the date on which 
  the samples were tested - was "in a confused state". On the record 
  before him, he was entitled to make that determination. Having made no palpable 
  and overriding error, I see no reason to interfere with his disposition of count 
  one.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p> [101] Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal in part, 
  and set aside that part of the judgment of the Summary Conviction Appeal court 
  that allowed the appeals against conviction of the City and Ms. Januskiewicz 
  in the Ministry's action. The result is to restore the convictions and acquittal 
  at first instance in the Ministry's action. The Crown's sentence appeal is remitted 
  to the Summary Conviction Appeal court to be dealt with accordingly. </p>
