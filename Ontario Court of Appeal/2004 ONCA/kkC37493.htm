<p>On appeal from the conviction by Justice T. David Marshall of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated January 14, 2000 and from the sentence imposed by Justice 
  T. David Marshall dated April 26, 2001.</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  GOUDGE J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] At his trial the appellant faced six pairs of charges of a sexual nature 
  involving six different complainants.</p>
<p>
  [2] In total, there were three counts of indecent assault, three counts of gross 
  indecency, two counts of sexual assault, two counts of sexual touching, one 
  count of rape and one count of sexual intercourse with a female between fourteen 
  and sixteen years of age.</p>
<p>
  [3] On January 14, 2000, after a six week trial, the jury found the appellant 
  guilty of charges in relation to five of the six complainants. In respect of 
  each of these five complainants, one conviction was entered and the second charge 
  was stayed because of the principle against multiple convictions. In addition 
  the appellant was designated a long term offender.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant argues that there were numerous errors in his trial. I need 
  only deal with the most important of these, namely the admission of bad character 
  evidence without a caution against propensity reasoning, and the tendering of 
  reply evidence by the Crown that was both inadmissible and further evidence 
  of bad character. These errors by the trial judge were serious and rendered 
  the appellant's trial unfair. They are not errors to which s. 686(1)(b)(iii) 
  of the Criminal Code can apply. The appeal must therefore be allowed and there 
  must be a new trial. Since these convictions form the foundation for the long 
  term offender designation, it too must be quashed.</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant was fifty-one years of age at the time of his trial. He was 
  convicted of sexually assaulting five female complainants in a small community 
  in southwestern Ontario. All the complainants knew the appellant and all but 
  one were related to him. Three of them alleged conduct that took place twenty 
  to thirty years ago, when they were young. These three were a niece of the appellant, 
  F.K., and two of his cousins, E.L. and K.B. The other two complainants were 
  C.H., the six-year-old granddaughter of the appellant's wife, Ms. K., and A.B., 
  an eleven-year-old neighbour. The charges relating to these two complainants 
  concerned alleged events between 1996 and 1998.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant gave evidence in his own defence and denied all of the allegations. 
  He also called a number of witnesses, including his former wife, R.Z., and his 
  present wife, Ms. K.</p>
<p>
  THE BAD CHARACTER EVIDENCE</p>
<p>
  (a) The appellant's physical and sexual abuse of R.Z.</p>
<p>
  [7] R.Z. was not a complainant. She gave evidence for the defence. However, 
  the Crown set the stage for the evidence that the appellant had abused her by 
  raising it first in cross-examination of the appellant: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Q. You were with R.Z. in a number of different places during the course of the 
  first marriage. Right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And the first marriage ended in around 1984?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Somewhere's around there, I divorced her.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. She kicked you out.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. I divorced her.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. She kicked you out, didn't she?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. I divorced her.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Were you physically abusive to her, sir?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. We pretty well were both physically abusive to each other 
  when we were drinking.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Were you physically abusive to her?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. I was to her, and she was to me.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Were you sexually abusive to her?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. No, I wasn't.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. How many times during the first marriage did she leave you?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. I don't know. I didn't keep count.</p>
<p>
  [8] The Crown then pursued the subject in cross-examining R.Z.: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Q. Now, would it be fair to say, ma'am, that there were a number of occasions 
  during the course of your being with K.K. that you were physically abused?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. By him.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And were there also a number of occasions you were sexually 
  abused by him?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p  class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Would it be fair to say, ma'am, that F.K. would have known 
  K.K. was abusive to you?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Everybody knew in the family.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Did F.K. know?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And did E.K. know?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p>
  [9] Before us, the Crown, who was not the prosecutor at trial, argues that this 
  evidence was admissible. She says that since F.K. was cross-examined at length 
  on her failure to complain to Ms. R.Z. (who was the appellant's wife at the 
  time of F.K.'s abuse), this evidence was relevant to demonstrate that F.K. could 
  not be expected to reach out to R.Z., when R.Z. could not even protect herself.</p>
<p>
  [10] I am very doubtful that this evidence was properly admitted. It was not 
  objected to, nor did the trial judge address its admissibility. Had he done 
  so, it is hard to see how he could have found its probative value more than 
  minimal compared to its obvious significant prejudicial effect. F.K. did not 
  offer her uncle's violence to R.Z. as a reason for not complaining to her, and 
  indeed said she saw R.Z. only about once a week. </p>
<p>
  [11] However, even if admissible, this evidence clearly required a caution. 
  It portrayed the appellant as a person who physically and sexually abused his 
  wife.</p>
<p>
  (b) The appellant's sexual relationship with his fourteen-year-old stepdaughter, 
  J.H.</p>
<p>
  [12] J.H., the daughter of K.K., is the mother of C.H. She was fourteen when 
  she gave birth to C.H. J.H. was not a complainant but was a Crown witness. Again, 
  the subject of the appellant's sexual relationship with J.H. was set up by the 
  Crown in cross-examining the appellant about abusing C.H.: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Q. But wouldn't the reason she wouldn't want to go with you, sir, is that when 
  you brought her there, you abuse her?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. No, that is not. I never abused that baby, and nobody can 
  say I did, because I never.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Well, I suggest to you, sir, you did.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Well, I'm saying that what you read in the papers was wrong. 
  I never abused that baby. I was more of a father to her than her real father. 
  Her real father has never, ever seen her.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. You're not her real father?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. No, I'm not.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. What is your relationship to J.?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. What's my relationship with J.? At one time she was one 
  of my stepdaughters. I had to look after her when I was with K., and she always 
  had no money for cigarettes or anything like that. But then I found out that 
  she was just out drinking, doing drugs and everything, so I just had nothin' 
  more to do with her. I talked to her, that's all.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Nothing more to do with her.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. No.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Didn't you have sex with her?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. No, I didn't.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Did you ever have arguments with Ms. K. about what you were 
  doing with J.?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. What I was doing with J.? She accused me of something that 
  I was not doing. I never did nothin' with J.</p>
<p>
  [13] The Crown then pursued the subject in his cross-examination of Ms. K. He 
  moved deliberately from asking Ms. K. about the appellant's opportunity to bathe 
  C.H. into the area of "what kind of fellow we're talking about": </p>
<p class="indent">
  Q. This time though, ma'am, at least my recollection and note is that you suggested 
  there were times he actually bathed her. Didn't you say that this morning?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. I don't know. I may have.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And did you mean to say that?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. I imagine though he probably did. To her, that was her daddy. 
  That was my husband. I believed, I trusted him.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Um hmm.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Like, I don't know the K.K. that you's are talking about. 
  I don't know how I'm supposed to.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. You&#133;you might have gotten a clue from what J. told 
  you about K.K., what kind of fellow we're talking about. Do you remember J. 
  talking to you about K.K.</p>
<p class="indent"> MR. CORNISH: You have to answer with words, ma'am.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Do you want a break?</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Ma'am, when J. was fifteen years old, that was in 1995?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. You were living on O. Street.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes, I was.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And J. was there with you.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Off and on.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Off and on. Do you remember, on one occasion, when J. was 
  over, J. being upstairs and K.&#133;actually K.K. was with her, and he slapped 
  her on the butt, and she laughed. You looked directly at him, and said, "What 
  the fuck are you doing?"</p>
<p class="indent"> And they both said, "Nothing" to you.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And then after K. left, K.K. left, you spoke to J. and asked 
  what was going on. Right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes, I did.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And she said, "K. does things to me." Right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And you said, "You mean, sexually abusing you?" Do you remember 
  asking her that?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And she said, "Yeah." Do you remember her saying that?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And then you asked if it was abuse or was she a willing 
  participant. Do you remember that?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes, I do.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And after you said that to her, she stopped talking. Right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes, she did.</p>
<p>
  [14] The Crown argues that this evidence was admissible to challenge Ms. K.'s 
  credibility and also to explain why J.H. did not complain to her mother about 
  her concerns over C.H. Again, there was no objection at trial, nor any ruling 
  on its admissibility. Again, however, I am very doubtful that this evidence 
  was admissible. Its probative value is dubious, particularly the suggestion 
  that the appellant had fathered his fourteen-year-old stepdaughter's child. 
  On the other hand, its very serious prejudicial effect is hard to overstate. 
  However, if admitted, at the least it warranted a significant caution in the 
  judge's charge because of the kind of person it portrayed the appellant to be.</p>
<p>
  (c) The appellant's additional sexual assault on F.K.</p>
<p>
  [15] F.K. was a complainant. In cross-examining R.Z., the Crown adduced evidence 
  that the appellant had sexually assaulted F.K. on a date outside those encompassed 
  by the indictment: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Q. And I believe you described to the officers in the video statement that F.K. 
  appeared to be one of his favourites.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And you say that because he used to pay a lot of attention 
  to her. Is that right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes. Everyone called her "baby" though, was her nickname.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Baby. And at one point, you saw him&#133;you saw a hickey 
  on F.K.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes. It wasn't only myself that saw it. Like, it was at 
  a picnic, and they were kidding around, and like, "Who put that on your neck?" 
  and she said, "K." and then they said they were just fooling around.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And you confronted K.K. about the hickey?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. He was right there when I said it.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And did he deny giving her the hickey?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. No.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And when we're talking about a hickey, that's where you 
  put your mouth on somebody and suck, and make a bruise on the neck. Right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And you also referred to it as a love mark.</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. How old was F. when you saw that?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. She was a teenager. I don't really recall how old.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Would you agree about thirteen or fourteen?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Could 'a been. </p>
<p>
  [16] Once again, even if this evidence was admissible, it was another example 
  of the bad character evidence that required an instruction from the trial judge 
  in his charge to the jury.</p>
<p>
  (d) The appellant as a drinker and womanizer </p>
<p>
  [17] The Crown also elicited evidence of the appellant's general bad character 
  in cross-examining the defence witness Lois Maracle: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Do you remember talking to R.Z. about the reason why you 
  left K.K.?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Because of his drinking, yes.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Well, I'm not asking you particulars of it, but I am going 
  to suggest to you that you told her that you left him because you were concerned 
  about his conduct with others.</p>
<p class="indent">A. Well, he is a womanizer, he does run around, and he did run 
  around on me.</p>
<p>
  [18] It is equally hard to see the possible relevance of this evidence. In any 
  event, it is but another piece of bad character evidence that made necessary 
  an instruction to the jury concerning propensity reasoning.</p>
<p>
  THE REPLY EVIDENCE</p>
<p>
  [19] In reply, the Crown called A.K., a daughter of R.Z. It elicited from A.K. 
  evidence designed to rebut the appellant's denial of having sexual relations 
  with J.H. The evidence that J.H. had slept with the appellant at his house was 
  clearly collateral to any issue before the court and on that basis alone, apart 
  from any other, was inadmissible reply. Moreover, it was further evidence of 
  the appellant's bad character. Despite the absence of an objection, the trial 
  judge erred in admitting it. In addition, it further exacerbated the error of 
  failing to warn the jury about propensity reasoning.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [20] In his charge, the trial judge did not refer to any of this evidence. He 
  gave the jury no instruction about the danger of propensity reasoning. Before 
  us, Ms. Tier fairly conceded that a limiting instruction should have been given, 
  but argued that no substantial wrong had resulted. </p>
<p>
  [21] I do not agree. Assuming this evidence is admissible, it carries the potential 
  of significant prejudicial effect that cannot be ignored. An instruction was 
  required that this evidence not be relied on as proof that the appellant is 
  the sort of person who would commit the offences charged and that he not be 
  found guilty on that basis. See R. v. B. (F.F.), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697 at 707-708.</p>
<p>
  [22] Moreover, the failure of defence counsel to object to the absence of such 
  a caution (or to the admissibility of the evidence at all) cannot be determinative 
  either of the gravity of the omission or of the consequences that should be 
  attached to it. See R. v. Chambers, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293 at 1319-20. Indeed, 
  it is arguable that where, as here, the error relates to a nondirection on an 
  important legal principle, the failure to object at trial will have much less 
  significance in determining the merits of this ground of appeal. See R. v. Harriott 
  (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.) per Doherty J.A. dissenting.</p>
<p>
  [23] In this case there are a number of factors that compel the conclusion that 
  the omission of a caution was a serious error that rendered the appellant's 
  trial fatally unfair.</p>
<p>
  [24] First is the nature of bad character evidence itself. Here, it painted 
  a picture of the accused as the kind of person who physically and sexually assaulted 
  those close to him, perhaps to the point of incest. In the context of these 
  charges this was extremely prejudicial.</p>
<p>
  [25] Second, the Crown's address to the jury used a theme that enhanced the 
  risk of propensity reasoning: </p>
<p class="indent"> [T]here is a rope in this case, and it is a rope that's comprised 
  of strands of thread, as all ropes are. The strands are the evidence, and the 
  evidence provides the facts. The facts show this man sexually abused six girls.</p>
<p class="indent">You have heard evidence of despicable acts, of a sexual nature, 
  that six separate girls have had forced upon them by this man. They have each 
  come forward and told, as best they could, what this man did to them.</p>
<p class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> Once you have considered the whole body of the evidence in 
  this case, I submit to you that there is no room for any reasonable doubt, as 
  to the fact that this man sexually assaulted C.H., sexually assaulted A.B., 
  and then raped E.L., indecently assaulted and committed acts of gross indecency 
  in respect of K.B., E.K., and her sister F. And those are the charges, just 
  briefly running through them.</p>
<p class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> [T]here are themes that each of the complainant's evidence 
  is supported by other evidence that you have heard, and after I deal with that, 
  the next theme in dealing with the evidence is that there is no conspiracy on 
  behalf of the J.s to get K.K., in order to advance their claim to custody of 
  C. And the other theme is, and this comes from dealing with each of the witnesses 
  in the supporting evidence of other witnesses, the strength of this case comes 
  by virtue of the diverse sources of evidence, apparently unconnected one from 
  another, because you will see, in my submission, when you look to the evidence, 
  that a witness in respect of one case, also provides some assistance on what 
  another case was all about [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [26] The Crown's closing proposition exemplified the problem by returning to 
  the fundamental metaphor: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There is a rope, and this evidence that binds K.K. to his misdeeds. Don't ignore 
  the rope.</p>
<p>
  [27] Third, the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that suggestions by 
  counsel not adopted by the witness cannot be taken as evidence. While the trial 
  judge had agreed beforehand with counsel that he would give this instruction, 
  he did not do so. When he himself noted this omission some three and one half 
  hours after the jury retired, both counsel agreed that by then it was too late. 
  However, particularly in light of the suggestions made by the Crown in cross-examining 
  the appellant, this omission simply exacerbated the risk that the jury might 
  engage in propensity reasoning.</p>
<p>
  [28] The final circumstance that makes the absence of a caution concerning bad 
  character evidence such a serious error in this trial relates to the number 
  of different charges that were tried together. </p>
<p>
  [29] The appellant faced six pairs of charges involving six complainants. Four 
  of them were historic, separated from the other two by several decades. The 
  appellant had originally elected trial by judge alone and sought separate trials 
  at least of the historic charges and the contemporary charges. He was unsuccessful. 
  Shortly before the trial, the appellant sought to re-elect trial by judge and 
  jury and agreed to abandon any further claim for severance in exchange for the 
  Crown's consent to his re-election. At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial 
  judge dismissed the Crown's application to have the evidence relating to each 
  count treated as similar fact evidence for the other counts.</p>
<p>
  [30] In these circumstances, while I think it would have been preferable to 
  separate these counts into two trials (one of the historic complaints and the 
  other of the contemporary complaints), it was within the trial judge's discretion 
  to proceed as he did. </p>
<p>
  [31] Having done so, however, his charge had to take full account of the risks 
  involved. The trial judge did warn the jury that they should not use the evidence 
  of one count as evidence on the other counts. However, the trial judge should 
  have gone further. The large number of complaints of serious criminal conduct 
  of a sexual nature together with the dismissal of the similar fact application 
  and the evidence of uncharged misconduct made it essential that the jury be 
  cautioned about propensity reasoning. In R. v. M.(B.) (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 1 
  (C.A.) Rosenberg J.A. was also dealing with a case involving multiple sexual 
  offences. He drew on the reasoning of Sopinka J. speaking for the Supreme Court 
  of Canada in R. v. Rarru, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 165 in describing the need for such 
  a caution in these circumstances. Rosenberg J.A. said this: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [41] Thus, in a case involving multiple counts and complainants, and where evidence 
  is led of other uncharged misconduct, Sopinka J. identified two essential elements 
  of a charge to the jury. First, when evidence of one count is not admissible 
  as similar fact evidence on the other counts, jurors must be instructed to consider 
  each charge separately and not to use evidence relating to one count as evidence 
  on any of the other counts. In this case, the jury charge does not include this 
  essential element. The charge does not clearly explain to the jurors that they 
  could not use the evidence of all the counts to prove any one count.</p>
<p>
  [42] Second, Rarru requires the trial judge to give the jury a proper limiting 
  instruction regardless of whether evidence of other counts or of uncharged misconduct 
  is admissible as similar fact evidence. The jury charge also fails to meet this 
  standard. Even if the evidence of the various counts had been admissible as 
  similar fact evidence, a limiting instruction was required. The jury had to 
  be warned about misuse of the evidence of criminal and disreputable conduct. 
  I have already referred to this issue in relation to the bestiality counts. 
  It was essential that the jury be instructed that it was not to rely on the 
  evidence of other counts or other uncharged misconduct as proof that the accused 
  is the sort of person who would commit the offence or offences charged. </p>
<p>
  [32] For the reasons I have described these errors were serious. They apply 
  to all the charges of which the appellant was convicted. Taken together they 
  render his trial unfair. I cannot agree with the Crown that s. 686(1)(b)(iii) 
  can be applied. The appellant's conviction is set aside and a new trial is ordered. 
  As a consequence, the finding of long term offender must be quashed as well.</p>
