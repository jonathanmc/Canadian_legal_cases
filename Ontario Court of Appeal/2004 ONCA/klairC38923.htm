<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice J. David Watt of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated September 20, 2002.</p>
<p>
  SHARPE J.A. (McCombs J. concurring): </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant pleaded guilty to one count of arson causing bodily harm and 
  was sentenced to life imprisonment. He seeks leave to appeal, and if leave is 
  granted, appeals his sentence to this court.</p>
<p>
  Facts</p>
<p>
  1. Circumstances of the Offence</p>
<p>
  [2] In the early afternoon of September 20, 2000, the appellant, at the time 
  seventy years old, was at his son's home babysitting Rajvir Klair, his four-year 
  old grandson. Some of the downstairs tenants were at home although it is not 
  clear whether the appellant was aware of their presence. Shortly after 2 p.m., 
  the appellant started three fires in the bedrooms of his son's house using gasoline 
  as an accelerant. After setting the fires, he walked away from the house. One 
  of the tenants heard smoke alarms and the cries of Rajvir and came upstairs. 
  She could not enter the house to rescue Rajvir because of the intensity of the 
  fire. Rajvir was screaming "monster, monster". After putting her own 
  child in a safe place, the tenant managed to coax Rajvir outside and to douse 
  the flames that covered him.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant returned to the house the next day. He was highly intoxicated. 
  He asked if Rajvir had been saved and, when told that Rajvir was alive, said 
  "Thank God." He stated that he had tried to hang himself with his 
  turban. There were no physical signs of any such attempt, but the appellant 
  was not wearing his turban when he was arrested. </p>
<p>
  [4] Rajvir suffered horrendous and devastating injuries as a result of the fire. 
  He suffered excruciating pain from second and third degree burns to about sixty 
  percent of his body. He has already undergone approximately twenty operations 
  and further surgery is expected. Rajvir has almost no use of his right arm and 
  limited movement of his left arm. He lost his left ear, all digits on his left 
  hand, two fingers on his right hand and two toes. He has significant scarring 
  and at the time of sentencing was in poor mental condition. </p>
<p>
  2. Circumstances of the Appellant</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant came to Canada from India in 1982. He remains in Canada as 
  a landed immigrant. He worked as a labourer until he retired about ten years 
  ago. He was married in India over forty years ago and has four children. The 
  appellant has no prior criminal record and was an active member in the local 
  Sikh community. He offered letters on the sentencing hearing to the effect that 
  he was well regarded and respected in his community as a hardworking person 
  of high morals and good character. </p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant has accepted responsibility for the offence. However, he offered 
  no explanation whatsoever for his conduct. At the sentencing hearing, he denied 
  that he intended to harm his grandson and expressed his remorse.</p>
<p>
  Reasons of the trial judge</p>
<p>
  [7] The trial judge accepted the Crown's submission that the offence could properly 
  be characterized as one of "stark horror" justifying the imposition 
  of life imprisonment. The trial judge stated "[i]t is difficult to fathom 
  a more callous disregard for human life&#133;". He based this finding on 
  the deliberate setting of the multiple fires, the breach of trust involved in 
  the appellants' abandonment of Rajvir inside the burning home, the terrible 
  injuries the child suffered, and the complete lack of an explanation for the 
  appellant's conduct. The trial judge recognized that in most "stark horror" 
  cases, "the violence, brutality or cruelty precedes or is contemporaneous 
  with the conduct component of the external circumstances of the crime, rather 
  than the consequences to the victim". However, in the end, he relied upon 
  the horrific consequences upon Rajvir as the key component to his finding of 
  stark horror: </p>
<p class="indent"> In many crimes, like this one, the external circumstances of 
  the offence, however, include both conduct, in this case causing damage by fire 
  to property, and consequences, causing bodily harm to another person. And it 
  is the consequences of the conduct that account for the more severe punishment&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">There seems no reason in principle, at least where the consequences 
  of conduct are included in the external circumstances of a crime, to restrict 
  'stark horror' to the conduct requirement, and ignore the consequences that 
  often reflect the nature of that conduct. In other words, 'the stark horror 
  of the crime itself' includes the stark horror associated with its consequences, 
  as well as the conduct [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [8] The trial judge was plainly troubled by the lack of explanation and inferred 
  some form of mental disorder. At one point in his reasons, he noted: "There 
  is no suggestion of any major mental illness or situational disorder as the 
  root cause of his uncharacteristic behaviour" [emphasis in original]. However, 
  later on he found that the conduct was "consistent only with a mental condition 
  that is badly out of whack" and that "the only reasonable conclusion 
  is that there is at work here a mind that is not whole, unhealthy, and untreated". 
  The trial judge observed that, while expert evidence is often presented to show 
  that the accused is a continuing danger to society to justify life imprisonment 
  for "stark horror" cases, it is not always required. </p>
<p>
  Issues</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant raised the following issues on appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Did the trial judge err by imposing life imprisonment on 
  the basis that the offence was one of "stark horror"? </p>
<p class="indent">2. Did the trial judge err with respect to the need for psychiatric 
  evidence? </p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  1. Did the trial judge by imposing life imprisonment on the basis that the offence 
  was one of "stark horror"? </p>
<p>
  [10] It is well established that a high degree of deference is to be accorded 
  sentencing decisions by trial judges. Absent an error in principle or failure 
  to consider a relevant factor, this court will not intervene unless the sentence 
  is demonstrably unfit, clearly unreasonable, or represents a substantial and 
  marked departure from sentences customarily imposed for similar offenders committing 
  similar offences: R. v. M. (C.A.), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500; R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 
  4 S.C.R. 227. The trial judge gave lengthy and carefully crafted reasons for 
  judgment and this court is bound to accord a high degree of deference to the 
  sentence he imposed. However, for the following reasons, it is my respectful 
  view that the trial judge erred in principle by imposing the maximum sentence 
  of life imprisonment and, because of that error in principle, we are required 
  to intervene.</p>
<p>
  [11] In my view, the trial judge erred by placing undue emphasis upon the consequences 
  of the offence and insufficient attention to the actual circumstances of the 
  offence and the blameworthiness of the appellant. To be more precise, in my 
  view, the trial judge erred by sentencing the appellant to life imprisonment 
  primarily because of the horrific consequences to Rajvir. The appellant intentionally 
  started the fire. However, on the basis of the charge to which he pleaded guilty, 
  and on the facts upon which the Crown relied in the sentencing proceedings, 
  he did not deliberately cause Rajvir to suffer his devastating injuries. Indeed, 
  the defence position that he did not intend to harm Rajvir was not challenged 
  at trial. The appellant pleaded guilty to an indictment alleging that he "unlawfully 
  did intentionally or recklessly cause damage by fire to property &#133; and 
  did thereby cause bodily harm to Rajvir Klair". He did not plead guilty 
  to attempted murder. The offence to which he pleaded guilty did not include 
  the element of intentional infliction of bodily harm. On the facts admitted 
  by the appellant and relied upon by the Crown, he was plainly guilty of manifest 
  disregard for the safety of the victim, but he was neither charged with, nor 
  did he admit to intentionally causing the horrific harm suffered by Rajvir. 
  </p>
<p>
  [12] After the trial judge delivered his reasons, and indeed after the oral 
  argument of this appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision in 
  R. v. Cheddesingh (March 19, 2004). We have received written submissions with 
  respect to this judgment where McLachlin C.J.C. stated, for a unanimous court</p>
<p class="indent"> &#133;terms such as 'stark horror', 'worst offence' and 'worst 
  offender' add nothing to the analysis and should be avoided. All relevant factors 
  under the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, must be considered. A maximum 
  penalty of any kind will by its very nature be imposed only rarely (see A. Manson, 
  Law of Sentencing (2001), at p. 106) and is only appropriate if the offence 
  is of sufficient gravity and the offender displays sufficient blameworthiness. 
</p>
<p>
  [13] I will return to the facts of Cheddesingh below, but I note here that the 
  Supreme Court affirmed the life sentence that had been imposed by the trial 
  judge on the basis of the "stark horror" category.</p>
<p>
  [14] In the case at bar, the trial judge relied exclusively on the "stark 
  horror" category to justify the life sentence and there was no suggestion 
  that apart from the "stark horror" principle, there was any other 
  basis to justify a life sentence. While the term "stark horror" must 
  now be avoided as unhelpful, the term was used to delineate factors common to 
  a particular type of case for which the maximum life sentence is appropriate. 
  The trial judge based his decision upon those cases and it is still useful to 
  consider them to gauge the gravity of the offence and the blameworthiness of 
  the offender required to justify the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 
  </p>
<p> [15] While I do not suggest that there is a fixed or inflexible set of factors, 
  cases of this kind that have been found to justify the imposition of the maximum 
  sentence of life imprisonment (formerly the "stark horror" cases) have presented 
  one or more of the following features: </p>
<ul>
  <li>cruelty, brutality, unusual violence</li>
  <li>terrorizing and torturing victim over a period of time</li>
  <li>intentional, prolonged, repeated violence against victim</li>
  <li>acts needlessly repeated or lack of feeling suggesting sadistic intent to 
    cause terror or even torture</li>
  <li>intentional infliction of pain, fright, panic that is tantamount to torture 
    solely for gratification or other perverse reason</li>
  <li>cruelty and callousness not frequently encountered</li>
  <li>deliberate infliction of brutal, disfiguring, life threatening injuries</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [16] It is significant that Cheddesingh requires both an offence of "sufficient 
  gravity" and an offender "who displays sufficient blameworthiness" 
  The severe consequences to Rajvir were certainly very grave, but those severe 
  consequences were not accompanied by conduct that rose to a level of blameworthiness 
  sufficient to justify a sentence of life imprisonment. Counsel for the respondent 
  was unable to point us to any case in which a life sentence has been imposed 
  upon a first offender for unintended consequences, even where those consequences 
  were caused recklessly. To do so would, in my view, amount to a significant 
  and unwarranted shift in the law of sentencing and invite life sentences in 
  a significant number of cases involving dire but unintended consequences and 
  where the sentence could not be justified on the basis of the blameworthiness 
  of the accused. As I do not consider the circumstances of the present case to 
  warrant such a change, and as I do not consider it possible to justify a sentence 
  of life imprisonment for this offender for this offence, I would allow the appeal, 
  set aside the sentence of life imprisonment, and in its place substitute a substantial 
  custodial sentence. </p>
<p>
  [17] The seminal judgment in this area is that of Martin J.A. in R. v. Horvath 
  (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 196 (Ont. C.A.). The accused had subjected his female 
  victim to a prolonged and sadistic attack. He gained access to her apartment 
  on the pretext of wanting to rent it, then bound, gagged, choked, and stabbed 
  her before finally slitting her throat. Martin J.A. observed that there were 
  two broad categories in which the maximum life sentence was available: first, 
  offences of stark horror, and second, pattern-of-violent-behaviour cases. This 
  must now be read in the light of Cheddesingh and the principle that as "sentencing 
  is an inherently individualized process" that cannot be achieved on the 
  basis of solely fixed or pre-determined categories: R. v. M.(C.A.), supra at 
  p. 567; R. v. Varga (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 502 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 527; R. v. 
  McArthur, [2004] O.J. No. 721 (C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [18] The appellant has certainly not demonstrated a pattern of violent behaviour. 
  He has no prior convictions of any kind and there is nothing in the record, 
  apart from the offence in question, to indicate that he has any propensity to 
  violence. I will return below to the significance of the absence of psychiatric 
  evidence, but I simply note here that none was presented to indicate that the 
  appellant poses a risk to public safety because of some mental condition or 
  disorder. </p>
<p>
  [19] To return to Horvath, Martin J.A. wrote that the extremity of the offence 
  itself was sufficient to justify the life sentence. Cautioning that it was not 
  "an exclusive definition" Martin J.A. stated, at p. 205, that "Mr. 
  Justice Ritchie's graphic phrase 'the stark horror of the crime'" had been 
  used to describe offences "accompanied by unusual features of brutality 
  or cruelty" for which a life sentence could be appropriate. Martin J.A. 
  added: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The cruelty and callousness which mark the conduct of the appellant are, fortunately, 
  not frequently encountered, and apart altogether from the psychiatric evidence, 
  clearly indicate a disturbed and dangerous personality.</p>
<p>
  [20] He concluded, at p. 207, that the offender's "utter lack of feeling 
  for the victim is consistent only with an abnormal personality, and portends 
  peril to others while he remains in his present state".</p>
<p>
  [21] Horvath has been followed in many cases, several of which I review below. 
  The startling feature of these cases attracting the maximum penalty of life 
  imprisonment has been the brutality and cruelty of the actions of the accused. 
  Considered in light of the Cheddesingh decision and the dual requirements of 
  an offence of sufficient gravity and an offender of sufficient blameworthiness, 
  the facts of these cases continue to warrant the imposition of a life sentence. 
  In each case, the actions of the accused are exceedingly brutal and cruel, rendering 
  them "sufficiently grave" on their face. Moreover, in each case the 
  accused intended these consequences, thereby becoming "sufficiently blameworthy" 
  for them. In no case do the consequences alone, unaccompanied by brutal or cruel 
  conduct intentionally inflicting the consequences, convert the offence to one 
  for which a life sentence is appropriate. </p>
<p>
  [22] In R. v. Charlebois (1987), 22 O.A.C. 235, the accused entered the victim's 
  apartment, grabbed her hair, and repeatedly stabbed her in the face. He slit 
  her throat from ear to ear, cutting her voice box. Her wounds were brutal, disfiguring, 
  and life threatening. Charlebois left the apartment, but returned. As the victim 
  lay helpless, he stabbed her in the back. Charlebois then left the victim to 
  drown in her own blood. The court found that "[i]t would be difficult to 
  devise a scenario which could be worse" and imposed a life sentence. </p>
<p>
  [23] In R. v. Lieug (1995), 82 O.A.C. 317 the accused attended at the victim's 
  place of employment with a hammer, a knife, and a bottle of sulphuric acid. 
  He struck the victim several times with the hammer. The victim tried to escape 
  to the bathroom, at which point the victim's employer tried to intervene. Lieug 
  threatened him with the knife and told him that he intended to kill the victim. 
  He then knocked down the bathroom door and spread sulphuric acid across the 
  victim's body, resulting in third degree burns. The trial judge noted the nature 
  of the assault, its planning, gravity and intensity and noted the absence of 
  remorse and found that that the victim would remain in danger if the appellant 
  were ever freed. This court upheld the life sentence.</p>
<p>
  [24] Another leading decision is R. v. Mesgun (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 739 (C.A.). 
  Mesgun coaxed his ex-fianc&eacute;e into his car and asked her to return to 
  the relationship. She refused. He began a savage assault with a knife. For a 
  period of thirty minutes, Mesgun slashed and stabbed the victim in her face, 
  neck, arms, and wrists. He tried to strangle her and gouge out her eyes. When 
  he thought she was dead, he punched her repeatedly in the face. When he realized 
  she was still alive, he attempted to stab her again. The victim opened the car 
  door and fell out. Mesgun drove away, leaving her to die on the street. The 
  trial judge stated, at p. 441: "I am of the view that no case of attempted 
  murder could exceed the brutality and cruelty of this case". This court 
  agreed that Mesgun's intentional, prolonged, and repeated stabbing of the victim, 
  his attempt to gouge out her eyes, his attempt to strangle her lacerated neck, 
  and his abandonment of her on the road to die, all exemplified unusual features 
  of brutality justifying the imposition of life imprisonment. </p>
<p>
  [25] Finally, in Cheddesingh itself the accused broke into two apartments before 
  breaking into the victim's apartment in a senior citizen's residence. He announced 
  his intention to rape the seventy-six-year old female occupant and then entered 
  into a discussion about whether he would follow through. He told her that he 
  had a razor and tried to suffocate her. He then sexually assaulted the victim, 
  digitally penetrating her, performing cunnilingus, and violently raping her. 
  The victim suffered severe lacerations to her vagina, requiring a blood transfusion. 
  She died one month later from cirrhosis associated with vaginal trauma. The 
  trial judge categorized the offence as one of stark horror. He based his finding 
  on Cheddesingh's torturous discussion of whether or not he would rape the victim; 
  the brutal violation of the victim's fundamental rights of privacy and security; 
  the victim's membership in a vulnerable class of persons; the fact that the 
  offences continued over a period of two to three hours; and the fact that the 
  offence debased the victim's life. The life sentence was upheld on appeal by 
  this court ((2002), 168 C.C.C. (3d) 310) and, as I have noted, on appeal to 
  the Supreme Court of Canada. </p>
<p>
  [26] In my view, the conduct of the appellant in the present case, while entirely 
  deplorable, simply cannot be equated to the type of senseless brutality and 
  cruelty found in Horvath, Cheddesingh and the other cases to which I have referred. 
  In each of these cases, the justification for the imposition of the maximum 
  penalty of life imprisonment was that severe and horrific harm had been deliberately 
  inflicted upon the victim. In the present case, the appellant exposed his victim 
  to the risk of similar harm, and for that he must be severely punished. However, 
  I cannot agree that it would be justifiable to sentence him on the same basis 
  as if he had deliberately and callously inflicted the harm. </p>
<p>
  [27] I now turn to two decisions, one from this court and the other from the 
  Newfoundland Court of Appeal, refusing to impose life sentences. A comparison 
  of the circumstances of the present case is, in my view, revealing. In both 
  cases, life sentences were refused for crimes that, from the perspective of 
  the blameworthiness of the offender, I would consider to be more shocking and 
  horrific than the one at issue in this appeal. </p>
<p>
  [28] In R. v. Edwards (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.), the appellant pleaded 
  guilty to the attempted murder of his spouse. They were living separately. Edwards, 
  the victim, their son, and two of their son's friends went for dinner. Later 
  that evening, the victim went into the master bedroom. She turned around and 
  Edwards grabbed her neck, called her a 'fucking bitch', and poked at her eyes. 
  Edwards choked the victim until she became unconscious. When she regained consciousness, 
  she was bleeding. One of her eyeballs was hanging out of its socket. Rosenberg 
  J.A. held that the facts of the case did not bring it within the parameters 
  of stark horror and that in the absence of psychiatric evidence demonstrating 
  that the appellant suffered "from a mental disorder that shows he or she 
  represents a continuing danger to the public and that there is little likelihood 
  of successful treatment" the imposition of life imprisonment could not 
  be justified.</p>
<p>
  [29] In R. v. Brown (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 26 (Nfld. C.A.), the accused and 
  the victim had a three-year relationship and a newborn daughter. They separated 
  prior to the birth of their child. Brown was angry that the victim would not 
  allow him to see the child. He broke into the victim's residence at night. Brown 
  stabbed and hit her, inflicting over twenty stab wounds to her body and extensive 
  trauma to her face and head. The victim's injuries were serious and extremely 
  painful. Brown showed no emotion in his statements to the police. Despite this 
  horrible attack, the Newfoundland Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge 
  erred in imposing a life sentence and substituted a sentence of fourteen years. 
  Steele J.A. noted specifically at p. 47 that the case lacked "an intent 
  or attempt to inflict pain, fright or panic - suffering tantamount to torture 
  - solely for his or her gratification or for some other perverse reason". 
  </p>
<p>
  [30] In my view, these comments are equally applicable to the facts of the present 
  case. Simply put, the offence at issue here does not exhibit the important common 
  features of the cases in which the maximum penalty of life imprisonment has 
  been imposed under the now-defunct "stark horror" category: there 
  was no terrorizing or torturing over a period of time; there was no prolonged 
  or repeated violence against the victim; there were no needlessly repeated acts 
  suggesting sadistic intent; and there was no indication that the arson was for 
  the purpose of gratification or any other perverse purpose. The circumstances 
  of this offence reveal shocking consequences for the victim. However, as the 
  appellant did not deliberately cause those consequences, the maximum penalty 
  of life imprisonment should not have been imposed. </p>
<p>
  2. Did the trial judge err with respect to the need for psychiatric evidence?</p>
<p>
  [31] While the appellant expressed remorse for the harm Rajvir suffered, he 
  offered no explanation for his conduct and the lack of any explanation plainly 
  troubled the trial judge. As I have already noted, the trial judge found that 
  the appellant's conduct was "consistent only with a mental condition that 
  is badly out of whack" and that "the only reasonable conclusion is 
  that there is at work here a mind that is not whole, unhealthy, and untreated". 
  </p>
<p>
  [32] As the passages I have quoted above from Horvath, Charlebois and Mesgun 
  indicate, psychiatric evidence is not always required to sustain a sentence 
  of life imprisonment in cases of this type. In some cases, the offence is so 
  bizarre and shocking that it is quite appropriate to infer from the circumstances 
  of the offence itself that the appellant poses an ongoing danger to the public. 
  On the other hand, as in Edwards, where the circumstances of the offence are 
  not sufficient, psychiatric evidence will be required. </p>
<p>
  [33] While the trial judge inferred that the appellant must suffer a form of 
  mental disorder, there is no explicit finding in his lengthy and carefully crafted 
  reasons of the nature of that disorder or that it meant the appellant posed 
  a continuing serious threat to public safety. In the end, I do not read the 
  reasons of the trial judge on this point as advancing the case for a life sentence 
  on the basis of the mental disorder from which he assumed the appellant suffered. 
  If I am wrong and the trial judge indeed did consider that the mental disorder 
  he attributed to the appellant rendered him sufficiently dangerous to tip the 
  balance in favour of a sentence of life imprisonment, then I respectfully say 
  that there is no evidence in this case capable of supporting that inference. 
  As I have already explained, the conduct of the appellant falls well short of 
  the shocking brutality exhibited in Horvath, Charlebois and Mesgun and it follows 
  that the inference of mental disorder properly drawn in those cases was not 
  available on the facts of this case. </p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [34] Accordingly I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and set aside 
  the sentence of life imprisonment. </p>
<p>
  [35] The Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 718, states that "the 
  fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute &#133; to respect for the 
  law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just 
  sanctions&#133;" and then sets out a number of sentencing objectives. The 
  objectives pertinent to the present case are denunciation, deterrence, separating 
  the offender from society, rehabilitation and the promotion of a sense of responsibility 
  in the offender and acknowledgement of the harm done to the victim and to the 
  community. Section 718.1 provides that "a sentence must be proportionate 
  to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender." 
  </p>
<p>
  [36] This was a serious crime with disastrous consequences and the objectives 
  of denunciation, deterrence, separating the offender from society and acknowledging 
  the harm done to the victim and to society clearly call for a significant penitentiary 
  sentence. The appellant intentionally set the fires and he exposed his victim 
  to a startling risk of physical harm and death. As noted by the trial judge, 
  the appellant's breach of trust as the victim's grandfather and babysitter is 
  an aggravating factor. However, as stated by Prof. Manson in the passage from 
  The Law of Sentencing, referred to in Cheddesingh, supra: "&#133;the imposition 
  of a maximum sentence is, and ought to be, rare. Few situations arise where 
  a lesser term will not adequately protect society and also reflect an appropriate 
  degree of denunciation."</p>
<p>
  [37] Factors weighing in the appellant's favour are his age and previously unblemished 
  record, his plea of guilty and his acceptance of responsibility for the harm 
  he has caused. </p>
<p>
  [38] In my view a fit sentence for this offender and this offence is twelve 
  years. The appellant is entitled to credit for two-years of pre-trial custody. 
  At trial, the Crown argued against the usual two for one credit as the appellant 
  had delayed the proceedings while he tried to arrange financial restitution 
  for the loss of his son's home. As the trial judge imposed a life sentence, 
  he did not deal with this submission. I agree with the appellant's submission 
  that in the circumstances of this case, he should not be denied the usual credit 
  for pre-trial custody. Accordingly, the sentence I would impose after taking 
  pre-trial custody into account is eight years.</p>

  FELDMAN J.A. (dissenting): </p>
<p>
  [39] I have read the reasons for judgment of Sharpe J.A., and find that I am 
  unable to agree with his finding that the determination of the appropriate sentence 
  by Watt J. must be set aside by this court. In my view, Watt J. made no error 
  in law or principle and his judgment deserves the deference of this court in 
  accordance with R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227. </p>
<p>
  [40] The sentence of life in prison was imposed following a fairly brief sentencing 
  hearing where the appellant pled guilty to the offence of intentionally or recklessly 
  causing damage by fire to property, thereby causing bodily harm to Rajvir Klair, 
  his four-year old grandson (s. 433(b) of the Criminal Code). Section 433 provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> 433. Every person who intentionally or recklessly causes damage 
  by fire or explosion to property, whether or not that person owns the property, 
  is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life where</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the person knows that or is reckless with respect to whether 
  the property is inhabited or occupied; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the fire or explosion causes bodily harm to another person.</p>
<p>
  [41] Following the reading of the facts and the plea, counsel for the Crown 
  and defence, both very experienced, each made their submissions with respect 
  to sentence. No pre-sentence report was prepared or filed, nor was any psychiatric 
  evidence presented. In his submissions, Crown counsel noted that he was not 
  in a position to compel the accused to submit to a psychiatric evaluation for 
  the purpose of sentencing. The only evidence provided on the sentencing was 
  one character reference letter from a member of the community. The appellant's 
  counsel stated in submissions that the appellant did not intend to harm his 
  grandson. However, when the appellant was asked if he wanted to say anything, 
  he said only: "I'm very sorry. I don't think I want to say anything more."</p>
<p>
  [42] Crown counsel at trial made a strong submission for a sentence of life 
  in prison on the basis that the offence was one of stark horror. In the alternative, 
  if a definite sentence were to be imposed, he suggested a term of ten years. 
  Appellant's counsel at trial submitted that a fit sentence was two years less 
  a day in reformatory.</p>
<p>
  [43] Watt J. reserved his decision for two weeks. On the day set for sentence, 
  the Crown filed a victim impact statement from the appellant's son, the father 
  of the victim, which described the horrific consequences of the fire to their 
  beloved child, as well as the devastating effect on the life of the parents, 
  including their financial fears for the future care of the child. </p>
<p>
  [44] Watt J. then gave his reasons for imposing a sentence of life in prison. 
  His reasons are a model, well organized and well articulated. They are twenty-three 
  pages in length and fully describe the circumstances of the offence including 
  the effects on the victim, the circumstances of the offender, the positions 
  of the parties including a complete pr&eacute;cis of each counsel's submissions, 
  and an analysis of the principles of sentencing and their application to this 
  case.</p>
<p>
  [45] In considering whether to impose a life sentence, Watt J. had to determine 
  whether this case was one that could be categorized as an offence of "stark 
  horror", in accordance with the then current jurisprudence. He focused 
  on the need for unusual brutality, violence and cruelty in the commission of 
  the offence as the basis for a finding of stark horror. However, he also concluded 
  that where, as with s. 433, the Criminal Code charge provides for life in prison 
  because of the consequences to the victim, the court may consider the consequences 
  to the victim as part of its stark horror analysis. Watt J. put it this way 
  at paras. 72 and 73 of his reasons: </p>
<p class="indent"> It is fair to say that in most cases where reliance has been 
  placed on the "stark horror" branch of Hill [v. The Queen (No. 2), [1977] 1 
  S.C.R. 827] to justify a sentence of life imprisonment, the violence, brutality 
  or cruelty precedes or is contemporaneous with the conduct component of the 
  external circumstances of the crime, rather than the consequences to the victim. 
  In many crimes, like this one, the external circumstances of the offence, however, 
  include both conduct, in this case causing damage by fire to property, and consequences, 
  causing bodily harm to another person. And it is the consequences of the conduct 
  that account for the more severe punishment. Compare, for example, sections 
  433 and 434 of the Criminal Code.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a></p>
<p class="indent">There seems no reason in principle, at least where the consequences 
  of conduct are included in the external circumstances of a crime, to restrict 
  "stark horror" to the conduct requirement, and ignore the consequences that 
  often reflect the nature of that conduct. In other words, "the stark horror 
  of the crime itself" includes the stark horror associated with its consequences, 
  as well as the conduct. </p>
<p>
  [46] My colleague considers it an error for the trial judge to have based the 
  sentence imposed primarily on the horrific consequences of the arson on the 
  little boy, rather than on the blameworthiness of the appellant. He also expresses 
  the concern that this is a shift that will lead to a large number of life sentences 
  where the conduct of the accused is not sufficiently blameworthy to merit such 
  a sentence. With respect, I disagree both with my colleague's view of the trial 
  judge's analysis and with his concern. First, the trial judge limits the circumstances 
  when the consequences may be a factor to a charge where the maximum penalty 
  is increased to reflect the effect of the criminal conduct on a victim, such 
  as in s. 433 of the Code. Second, although the trial judge includes the consequences 
  to the victim as part of his stark horror analysis, his primary focus is on 
  the blameworthiness of the conduct of the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [47] Watt J. explained in the above-quoted paragraphs why he concluded that 
  on this particular charge (s.433), where the consequences of the arson expand 
  the scope of the maximum sentence to life in prison, those consequences can 
  also be considered in the stark horror analysis for the purpose of imposing 
  the appropriate sentence. This limited application of the consequences of the 
  crime answers the "floodgates" concern of my colleague. Then, in making 
  his ultimate finding that this was a case of stark horror, while the trial judge 
  considered the unspeakable effects of the crime on the little boy, he emphasized 
  the blameworthy conduct of the appellant, its brutality and cruelty, at paragraphs 
  79-82: </p>
<p class="indent"> For may part, I cannot imagine much conduct that is any more 
  starkly horrific than deliberately setting three fires in a residence, with 
  full knowledge that the floor where the fires were set was occupied by a four 
  year old child, a member of a vulnerable class of persons and one to whom the 
  fire-setter stood in loco parentis. And not just setting fires, but using an 
  accelerant to speed up the ignition and burning process. If he knew the tenants 
  were home, he put their lives at risk as well. And if he didn't, he was most 
  fortunate to escape a conviction for murder.</p>
<p class="indent">To underscore his brutality, he simply walked away, deliberately 
  shutting his eyes to whether his grandson burned to death, suffocated, or both.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no motive for this crime. And there is no explanation. 
  The only reasonable conclusion is that there is at work here a mind that is 
  not whole, unhealthy, and untreated.</p>
<p class="indent">And the consequences? A little boy is assigned a place in a 
  freakish hell. This is stark horror, at least to my reckoning.</p>
<p>
  [48] In my view, the trial judge made no error in his consideration of the stark 
  horror analysis. It is clear that he focused on the blameworthiness of the appellant's 
  conduct in making the finding of stark horror and imposing the maximum sentence. 
  Of course, after the recent Supreme Court decision in R. v. Cheddisingh, 2004 
  SCC 16, where the court stated that terms such as "stark horror", 
  "worst offender" and "worst offence" should be avoided, 
  the cogency of the stark horror analysis and the applicability of the case law 
  on which it was based are less important than the court's consideration of all 
  the relevant factors in the Code, and the court's adherence to the principle 
  that: "A maximum penalty of any kind will by its very nature be imposed 
  only rarely (see A. Manson, Law of sentencing (2001), at p. 106) and is only 
  appropriate if the offence is of sufficient gravity and the offender displays 
  sufficient blameworthiness. As is always the case with sentencing, the inquiry 
  must proceed on a case-by-case basis" (para. 1).</p>
<p> [49] Watt J. fully considered all of the Code factors. He was also clearly 
  satisfied that the appellant's deliberate conduct, knowing what he was causing 
  to happen to his helpless grandson, was significantly blameworthy conduct that 
  warranted the maximum penalty. Sharpe J.A. minimizes the blameworthiness of 
  the appellant's conduct on the basis that, in accordance with his plea to the 
  offence under s. 433, he did not intentionally inflict harm on the child. However, 
  Watt J. was entitled to view the conduct of the appellant as indicative of the 
  maximum blameworthiness for this offence. While babysitting the four-year old 
  child, the appellant deliberately set the fire with gasoline in three places 
  plus he left the stove on and walked out of the house when the child was burning,<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> 
  with no thought of saving the child. There was no suggestion of intoxication 
  or any other factor that would negate the ordinary inference that a person intends 
  the natural consequences of his actions. His inquiry on his return about whether 
  his grandson had survived, demonstrated that he was aware of what could have 
  happened to the child. Watt J. found, as quoted above, that the appellant "deliberately 
  shut[] his eyes to whether his grandson burned to death, suffocated, or both".</p>
<p>
  [50] Watt J. also considered the fact that there was no expert evidence in this 
  case that the appellant represented a continuing danger, as there has been in 
  many of the stark horror/life sentence cases. He concluded that the circumstances 
  of the offence indicated, without the need for expert testimony, that the appellant 
  has a personality disturbance or other mental disorder. </p>
<p>
  [51] He distinguished on two bases this court's decision in R. v. Edwards (2001), 
  54 O.R. (3d) 737 at para. 70 (C.A.) where the court suggested that the absence 
  of expert testimony about the prognosis for successful rehabilitation during 
  a fixed term "told against" the imposition of a life sentence on the 
  basis of stark horror. He noted first, that in that case, Crown counsel on appeal 
  did not press the stark horror argument; second, the court did not say that 
  there must always be expert evidence on the accused's prognosis for ongoing 
  danger if there is only a fixed term sentence, but only that there will often 
  be such evidence. Watt J. commented that expert evidence cannot be a requirement 
  of a finding of stark horror, because an accused cannot be compelled to participate 
  in a psychiatric evaluation, and the opinion of a psychiatrist without such 
  an evaluation may add nothing to the court's assessment.</p>
<p>
  [52] Based on the circumstances of the crime itself, together with the appellant's 
  failure to give any explanation for his actions, Watt J. was satisfied, without 
  expert evidence, that the appellant did have some mental problem that required 
  treatment. Without this treatment, the court could not be assured that he did 
  not represent an ongoing danger to the public or to a segment of it. </p>
<p>
  [53] My colleague disputes the trial judge's inference of mental disorder. In 
  my view, the trial judge was entitled to draw the inference on the bases that 
  he described. The drawing of inferences is the province of the trial judge: 
  Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. I also agree with Watt J. that in 
  circumstances where the accused elects not to participate in a psychiatric assessment, 
  it would be problematic if the court were precluded from drawing inferences 
  from the circumstances that would allow it to impose the appropriate sentence.</p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [54] This was a most difficult sentencing decision. The horrific aspects of 
  the crime were not limited to its nature as a deliberate arson. The relationship 
  of the young boy and his grandfather had previously been one of love and trust. 
  The father of the boy was betrayed by his own father. The actions of the appellant 
  were completely unexplained, leaving all involved with continuing unease, as 
  well as despair. The ongoing pain and suffering of the boy is unspeakable. The 
  emotional and financial hardship on the parents is unfathomable. On the other 
  hand, the appellant is an elderly man with no criminal record and a previously 
  good reputation in the community.</p>
<p>
  [55] The experienced and learned trial judge gave reasons that are lucid and 
  deal with each issue, balancing all of the statutory factors in the context 
  of the relevant case law and the factual circumstances. It is clear that he 
  recognized that the penalty of life imprisonment is to be imposed only rarely. 
  In my view, he made no errors of law or principle and his decision that this 
  was one of those rare cases deserves the deference of this court. </p>
