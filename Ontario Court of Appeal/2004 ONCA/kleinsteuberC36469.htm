<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Unfortunately, the charge to the jury contained several errors in this 
  case, some of which are serious. </p>
<p>[2] The most serious error was the absence of an instruction to the jury on 
  the numerous prior consistent statements the complainant made to various people 
  before she went to the police. A careful limiting instruction was required, 
  (see R. v. R. (A.F.) (2001), 156 C.C.C. (3d) 336 (Ont. C.A.)), especially since 
  the appellant testified in this case and, therefore, his credibility and that 
  of the complainant were crucial to its resolution. This case plainly does not 
  present the unique features of R. v. Demetrius (2003), 179 C.C.C. (3d) 26 (Ont. 
  C.A.), where a limiting instruction was not required. </p>
<p>[3] Moreover, not only did the trial judge fail to give an appropriate instruction 
  on this issue, in addition, the jury might well have taken from her charge that 
  the earlier complaints could be improperly used to bolster the complainant's 
  credibility. </p>
<p>[4] In addition, the trial judge used the wrong version of the Lifchus charge 
  a full sixteen months after it had been corrected by the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</p>
<p>[5] The trial judge also improperly limited the defence attempt to advance 
  a theory based on a different potential perpetrator. </p>
<p>[6] The appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered. However, we note that 
  the appellant has served his sentence. This is an important factor which we 
  trust the Crown will carefully consider in determining whether to proceed with 
  a new trial. </p>
