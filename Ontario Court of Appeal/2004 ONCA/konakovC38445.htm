<p>On appeal from the order of Justice W. Brian Stead of the Ontario Court of 
  Justice dated April 11, 2002.</p>
<p>
  WEILER J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This appeal concerns the validity of the City of Brantford's (&quot;the 
  City&quot;) omnibus zoning By-law No. 160-90 (&quot;the By-law&quot;), passed 
  pursuant to paragraph 1 of s. 34(1) of the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13. 
  The By-law does not provide for the existence of a body rub parlour as a specific 
  use in any area of the City. </p>
<p>
  [2] Mr. Konakov operates a body rub parlour at 450 St. Paul Street in the City 
  under the name of Marilyn. As a result of a complaint, the City met with Mr. 
  Konakov and then sent him a letter dated April 18, 2000. It states in part: </p>
<p class="indent">
  All property within the City of Brantford is regulated by Zoning Bylaw 160-90 
  which does not permit a Body Rub Parlour at any location. </p>
<p class="center"> &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent"> During our meeting, we advised you that you may make application 
  to have Zoning Bylaw 160-90 amended to permit this use and provided you with 
  the necessary application form. We also advised you that an application must 
  be accompanied by written consent from the property owner and further that there 
  is no guarantee that your application will be approved.</p>
<p class="indent"> In addition, I advised you at this meeting that this illegal 
  use must cease immediately and not commence operation again unless your application 
  for rezoning of the property is approved to permit this use. </p>
<p>The City also sent a copy of the letter to the registered owners of the property. 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] Mr. Konakov did not cease to operate the body rub parlour and the City charged 
  him with violating the By-law. At his trial before Justice of the Peace Shortell, 
  he argued that the By-law was invalid for being vague and prohibitory. The Justice 
  of the Peace held that, &quot;[A] Municipality does not have the power to prohibit 
  what is an otherwise lawful activity.&quot; He held the By-law invalid and dismissed 
  the charges against Mr. Konakov. Having decided that the By-law was invalid 
  because it was prohibitory, he did not deal with the vagueness argument.</p>
<p>
  [4] The City appealed. It argued that the Justice of the Peace referred to and 
  relied on a decision respecting the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45 in his 
  reasons and did not consider the differences in wording of the Planning Act. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] The powers of &quot;licensing, regulating, governing, classifying and inspecting&quot; 
  contained in s. 225 of the Municipal Act relating to adult entertainment parlours 
  do not include the power to prohibit what is an otherwise lawful activity: Treesann 
  Management Inc. v. Richmond Hill (Town) (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 221 (Ont. C.A.). 
  Section 34(1) of the Planning Act, on the other hand, does allow a local municipality 
  to pass a by-law, &quot;For prohibiting the use of land, for or except for such 
  purposes as may be set out in the by-law within the municipality or within any 
  defined area or areas&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [6] Justice Stead rejected the City's argument that By-law 160-90 was a valid 
  exercise of its power under s. 34(1) of the Planning Act. He held at paras. 
  7 and 8: </p>
<p class="indent">
  To allow a municipality this unfettered discretion could, in my opinion, lead 
  to potentially absurd results. It gives them the power to decide they do not 
  want any churches or gas stations or any number of otherwise lawful activities 
  within their corporate limits and thus pass bylaws to prohibit them entirely. 
  Surely this could not have been the intent of the legislature when it enacted 
  the Planning Act. </p>
<p class="indent"> I believe that the legislature in allowing the municipality 
  to prohibit land uses within its boundaries intended that the same be used to 
  regulate the use of land within the municipality by prohibiting land uses in 
  areas within its limits, but not to prohibit entirely within its boundaries 
  what is otherwise a lawful activity. The same, in my opinion, is an unreasonable 
  interpretation of s. 35 of the Planning Act and leads to absurd results. I fail 
  to see how a prohibitory bylaw passed under the guise of a licence is different 
  from one passed under a zoning bylaw. </p>
<p>[7] With respect to the appeal judge, the issue before him was whether the 
  City had the authority to pass the By-law at issue, not whether the By-law was 
  reasonable. The decision of Rogers v. City of Toronto (1915), 33 O.L.R. 89 cited 
  with approval in Shell Canada Products Ltd. v. Vancouver (City), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 
  231 at para. 94 stands for the proposition that, in reviewing the exercise of 
  municipal power on the basis of jurisdiction to pass a by-law, courts ought 
  not to assess the reasonableness of a particular exercise of municipal power. 
  That is a different issue. Further, the doctrine of unreasonableness permitting 
  the declaration of invalidity of municipal by-laws is a limited one such as 
  where it can be shown that the by-law was enacted in bad faith or discriminates 
  in a manner that was unrelated to a valid planning purpose: R. v. Bell, [1979] 
  2 S.C.R. 212; Re H.G. Winton Ltd. and Borough of North York (1979) 88 D.L.R. 
  (3d) 733 (Ont. Div. Ct.). See also Canadian Municipal and Planning Law (Ontario: 
  Carswell, 1983) by Stanley Makuch at 201 and 207. A by-law, otherwise enacted 
  for proper municipal purposes, is not unreasonable or invalid merely because 
  it contains a moral element: Nova Scotia (Board of Censors) v. MacNeil, [1978] 
  2 S.C.R. 662.</p>
<p>
  [8] In the end, the appeal judge appears to have decided the appeal on the basis 
  that the zoning By-law in issue was no different than &quot;a prohibitory by-law 
  passed under the guise of a licence.&quot; For the reasons that follow I would 
  respectfully disagree with the appeal court judge's characterization and conclusion 
  respecting the By-law.</p>
<p>
  [9] I begin by noting that the party challenging a by-law's validity bears an 
  evidentiary burden of proving that it is ultra vires: see Kuchma v. Tache [Rural 
  Municipality], [1945] S.C.R. 234 at 239, and Montr&eacute;al (City) v. Arcade 
  Amusements Inc., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 368 at 395. </p>
<p>
  [10] The proper approach to assessing the validity of a municipal by-law is 
  set out in 114957 Canada Lt&eacute;e (Spraytech, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'arrosage) 
  v. Hudson (Town), [2001] 2 S.C.R. 241, where, in dealing with the validity of 
  a by-law purporting to ban the use of pesticides throughout the City, L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; 
  J. stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In R. v. Sharma, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 650, at p. 668, this Court recognized &quot;the 
  principle that, as statutory bodies, municipalities 'may exercise only those 
  powers expressly conferred by statute, those powers necessarily or fairly implied 
  by the expressed power in the statute, and those indispensable powers essential 
  and not merely convenient to the effectuation of the purposes of the corporation' 
  (Makuch, Canadian Municipal and Planning Law (1983), at p. 115)&quot;. Included 
  in this authority are &quot;general welfare&quot; powers, conferred by provisions 
  in provincial enabling legislation, on which municipalities can draw. As I. 
  M. Rogers points out, &quot;the legislature cannot possibly foresee all the 
  powers that are necessary to the statutory equipment of its creatures.... Undoubtedly 
  the inclusion of 'general welfare' provisions was intended to circumvent, to 
  some extent, the effect of the doctrine of ultra vires which puts the municipalities 
  in the position of having to point to an express grant of authority to justify 
  each corporate act&quot; (The Law of Canadian Municipal Corporations (2nd ed. 
  (loose-leaf)), Cum. Supp. to vol. 1, at p. 367).</p>
<p>
  [11] Similarly, in Nanaimo (City) v. Rascal Trucking Ltd., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 342 
  at para. 36, the Supreme Court quoted with approval the following statement 
  by McLachlin J. in Shell Canada Products Ltd. v. Vancouver (City), [1994] 1 
  S.C.R. 231 at 244: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Recent commentary suggests an emerging consensus that courts must respect the 
  responsibility of elected municipal bodies to serve the people who elected them 
  and exercise caution to avoid substituting their views of what is best for the 
  citizens for those of municipal councils. Barring clear demonstration that a 
  municipal decision was beyond its powers, courts should not so hold. In cases 
  where powers are not expressly conferred but may be implied, courts must be 
  prepared to adopt the &quot;benevolent construction&quot; which this Court referred 
  to in Greenbaum, [[1993] 1 S.C.R. 674] and confer the powers by reasonable implication. 
  Whatever rules of construction are applied, they must not be used to usurp the 
  legitimate role of municipal bodies as community representatives [emphasis added 
  by McLachlin J.]. </p>
<p>
  [12] With this background in mind, it is appropriate to consider what a zoning 
  by-law does. In &quot;An Introduction to Zoning Enabling Legislation&quot; (1962) 
  40 Can. Bar Rev. 1 at 2, Professor J.B. Milner states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A zoning by-law does two things, usually: it classifies and segregates into 
  particular districts or areas or zones the various uses of land and buildings 
  that are permitted by the by-law, all other uses being prohibited; and it regulates 
  the permitted uses in varying degrees depending upon attendant circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [13] The By-law in question is an example of the more open-ended or &quot;omnibus&quot; 
  provisions that allow municipalities to respond expeditiously to challenges 
  facing local communities concerning the use of land. As I.M. Rogers elaborates 
  in The Law of Canadian Municipal Corporations, Cum. Supp to vol. 2, 2nd ed., 
  loose- leaf (Toronto: Carswell, 1971) at &sect; 138.11: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Councils in Ontario are authorized by the Planning Act to regulate by by-law, 
  for or except for certain specified purposes, the use of land within the municipality 
  or within such areas or abutting on such highways or parts thereof as are defined 
  in the particular by-law. The council can prescribe only one purpose in a by-law 
  as a permitted use. Conversely it can in its by-law single out and prohibit 
  a single use. Such by-laws are exclusionary ones and prohibit any use of land 
  or building except for those defined as permitted uses so that any use that 
  is not specifically permitted is excluded. A by-law which prohibits all uses 
  except permitted uses does not make it prohibitory. It is a sensible and convenient 
  way of regulating zones within the municipality. [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [14] Where, for example, an area is zoned for agricultural uses, a municipality 
  has the power to refuse to amend its zoning by-law to allow a church to be built 
  where the proposed use does not comply with the official plan, zoning by-laws, 
  government policies and the proposed use is available in an adjacent town: Jehovah's 
  Witnesses v. South Easthope (Township) (1995), 32 O.M.B.R. 143. The fact that 
  some churches were permitted in other agricultural zones did not amount to impermissible 
  discrimination under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms respecting 
  religious freedom because this freedom is subject to the limitation that the 
  rights and freedoms of others be considered.</p>
<p>
  [15] The current official plan for Brantford does not include any specific policies 
  related to a body rub parlour. The use, however, can be considered to be a personal 
  service use which is included in the list of uses under the &quot;General Commercial&quot; 
  land use designation in the Official Plan. </p>
<p>
  [16] The City's Comprehensive Zoning By-law No. 160-90 was enacted pursuant 
  to s. 34 of the Planning Act and affects all lands within the corporate limits 
  of the City. The By-law includes 33 categories of zones. Each category identifies 
  specific uses that are permitted. Uses that are not specifically identified 
  or permitted in the zone category are prohibited. The exclusionary nature of 
  such zoning by-laws means that not all uses will be permitted.</p>
<p> [17] The respondent argues that the By-law in question imposes an impermissible 
  absolute ban on body rub parlours. This is because the By-law, while defining 
  a body rub parlour, does not specifically permit body rub parlours in any zone. 
  Instead, the respondent would be required to, first, obtain the consent of the 
  owner of the premises to operate a body rub parlour and, second, to apply to 
  Municipal Council for an amendment to the By-law respecting commercial uses 
  which would have the effect of permitting him to operate a body rub parlour. 
  This is not the same as if council passed a by-law positively banning body rub 
  parlours in all zones. It may be inferred that the purpose of an omnibus by-law 
  requiring an application for a site-specific amendment is to enable council 
  to consider the impact of the proposed use on a case by case basis having regard 
  to considerations such as whether the proposed use would be suitable and compatible 
  with other properties in the area, affect property values,<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  create a nuisance or would otherwise affect the general welfare of its citizens. 
  In addition, conditions designed to meet concerns relating to the proposed use, 
  could be imposed as a prerequisite to approval of the proposed use.</p>
<p>
  [18] Through zoning by-laws a municipality chooses the type of uses it will 
  permit in certain or all parts of land under its jurisdiction and so long as 
  there are proper planning grounds or standards to warrant these distinctions, 
  this is a valid exercise of jurisdiction. A municipality will not be permitted 
  to invoke the implicit power granted in order to enact by-laws that are in fact 
  related to ulterior objectives: Spraytech, supra. Such a by-law must be approached 
  with caution. The City had jurisdiction to enact the By-law it did subject to 
  the purpose of the By-law being shown to be an improper one. </p>
<p>
  [19] Support for my conclusion is found in the decision in Cunningham v. Regina 
  (City) (1994), 110 D.L.R. (4th) 640 (Sask. C.A.) and the text Municipalities 
  and Canadian Law: Defining the Authority of Local Governments (Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: 
  Purich Publishing, 1996) by Felix Hoehn. </p>
<p>
  [20] In Cunningham, supra, the Court held that the city of Regina had the power 
  to prohibit an adult cabaret from operating throughout the municipality pursuant 
  to the Planning and Development Act, 1983 S.S. c. P-13.1. Section 73 of the 
  Act stated, &quot;a zoning By-law may&#133; contain provisions: (a) prescribing 
  with respect to each district&#133;(ii) if necessary, the prohibited uses of 
  land or buildings or prohibited forms of development&quot; [emphasis added]. 
  Lane J.A. held at p. 644: </p>
<p class="indent"> Municipalities, in the interest of their inhabitants and after 
  appropriate consideration, list the permitted uses for each zone with all other 
  uses being prohibited. Indeed, it would be practically impossible to require 
  municipalities to create a list of every possible use of land. </p>
<p class="indent">The combined operation of ss. 66 and 73(a)(ii) give municipal 
  council broad general powers to adopt a zoning by-law; however, those powers 
  expressly include the power to prohibit uses. In my view, s. 73(a)(ii) simply 
  confirms the general scheme; that is, uses are prohibited unless permitted. 
  Council having made such a decision, the court ought to defer to council's determination 
  of the public interest. </p>
<p>[21] Academic commentary on this decision has been critical of the Court's 
  extrapolation of the power to prohibit a legal use in every district from the 
  power to prohibit a legal use in &quot;each district&quot;: see Municipalities 
  and Canadian Law, supra, at 163-165 and Ryan Remple's article, &quot;1994 Survey 
  of Decisions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal&quot; (1995) 59 Sask. L. Rev. 
  1 at 12. </p>
<p>
  [22] The wording of s. 34(1) of the Planning Act does not present such a problem. 
  </p>
<p>
  Hoehn states at pp. 165-166: </p>
<p class="indent"> Comparable legislation in some other jurisdictions contains 
  wording that could more readily support an interpretation that the prohibition 
  of a use from all areas is within the scope of the zoning power. Ontario, for 
  instance, allows the prohibition of land uses &quot;within the municipality 
  or within any defined area or areas&quot;<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  He cautions however, at p. 166: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Even in those jurisdictions where a general power to prohibit a land use is 
  expressly conferred, the prohibition of a use may still be ultra vires if it 
  is discriminatory or in bad faith. Similarly, if a general ban of a use is motivated 
  by considerations of morality, then it may be ultra vires as an infringement 
  of the criminal law power. One might, for instance, speculate that an absolute 
  prohibition of strip clubs may be motivated more by moral objections to the 
  use than by objections strictly related to land use planning. This point was 
  not argued in Cunningham and it appears that no evidence of council's motivation 
  was presented to court.</p>
<p>So too, here, there has been no evidence as to council's motivation presented 
  to the court or argument on it. </p>
<p>
  [23] To ensure that a body rub parlour could not operate under the definition 
  of &quot;health club&quot; or &quot;home occupation&quot; and to clarify the 
  difference between a body rub parlour and a licenced practitioner such as a 
  registered massage therapist or health professional defined under the Regulated 
  Health Professionals Act, S.O. 1991, c. 18, a definition of a body rub parlour 
  was added to the omnibus By-law in 1993. The core of the zoning By-law, that 
  an application must be made for site-specific amendment to the By-law to permit 
  a prohibited use, remained. Prior to this amendment, Council repealed a By-law 
  enacted under the Municipal Act that had stipulated the licensing requirements 
  for a body rub parlour. I am not prepared to infer any improper discriminatory 
  purpose to Council from the mere fact of these amendments. </p>
<p>
  [24] The respondent relies on the decision of this Court in Treesann, supra, 
  which held that a by-law enacted under the Municipal Act could not offer an 
  illusory licensing scheme that prohibited adult entertainment parlours in the 
  Town. Carthy J.A., on behalf of the Court, held that the by-law was prohibitory 
  and beyond the authority of the municipality. As I have indicated, the wording 
  of the two pieces of legislation indicates that the powers conferred under the 
  Municipal Act are different than the powers conferred under the Planning Act 
  and these differences must be accorded meaning. Furthermore, the type of by-law 
  at issue here is not, as the passage cited from Rogers, supra, indicates, characterized 
  as a prohibitory by-law. I also note that the use at issue in Treesann involved 
  an existing use and the by-law in issue affected existing rights. Here we are 
  not dealing with an existing right or non conforming use. Further, in Treesann, 
  Carthy J.A. commented at p. 226 that the applicant was &quot;still faced with 
  the prospect that the Town will process proper by-laws, with due process, and 
  directed to its original purpose of eliminating adult entertainment from the 
  Yonge corridor.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [25] In the event that the respondent obtains the consent of the owner to operate 
  a body rub parlour and applies for an amendment to the By-law and the City denies 
  the application, the respondent has a right of appeal to the Ontario Municipal 
  Board: Russell v. Toronto (City), [2000] 52 O.R. (3d) 9 (C.A.). The Ontario 
  Municipal Board has jurisdiction to deal with the validity of a by-law: Toronto 
  (City) v. Goldlist Properties Inc., [2003] O.J. No. 3931 (C.A.). It would also 
  have jurisdiction to deal with a refusal to amend the By-law to permit a site 
  specific use on the basis the refusal was not related to a legitimate planning 
  purpose or otherwise amounted to impermissible discrimination. </p>
<p>
  [26] Before us, there was no dispute that if the City had jurisdiction to enact 
  the By-law in issue, the respondent was guilty as charged of operating a body 
  rub parlour in a C8 General Commercial Zone prohibited under s. 9.8.1 of Zoning 
  By-law No. 160-90 and contrary to s. 67 of the Planning Act. Having found that 
  the City had the jurisdiction, for the reasons given I would allow the appeal, 
  set aside the acquittal and order that a conviction be registered.</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> Zoning by-laws are remedial in character 
  in that one of their objects is to preserve existing property from depreciation: 
  Toronto (City) v. Williams (1912), 27 O.L.R. 186 at 191 (H.C.J. Div Ct.); Re 
  Dinnick and McCallum (1913), 11 D.L.R. 509 (Ont. Sup. Ct. App. Div.).</p>
<p><a name="2"></a><a href="#r2">[2]</a> It is important to appreciate the distinction 
  between a by-law which prohibits any use of land and a by-law which prohibits 
  a specific type of use from all areas of the municipality. For instance, in 
  Soo Mill &amp; Lumber Co. Ltd. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie, [1973] 2 O.R. 110 
  (C.A.) aff&#146;d [1975] 2 S.C.R. 78, the court considered the validity of an 
  official plan which temporarily designated certain areas under a &#147;holding 
  category&#148; - effectively prohibiting any use of the land. The By-law was 
  nonetheless upheld. See also Hartel Holdings Co. Ltd. v. Calgary (City), [1984] 
  1 S.C.R. 337. </p>
