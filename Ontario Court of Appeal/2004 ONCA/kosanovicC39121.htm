<p>On appeal from the order of Justice James C. Kent of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated October 3, 2002.</p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. Overview</p>
<p>
  [1] The respondent, Dean Kosanovic, was injured in a car accident on September 
  7, 1997. The driver of the other car - who was at fault - left the 
  scene of the accident and has never been identified. The appellant, The Wawanesa 
  Mutual Insurance Company, insured Mr. Kosanovic under a standard Ontario automobile 
  policy. The unidentified driver coverage in that policy entitled Mr. Kosanovic 
  to the minimum policy limits of $200,000. However, Mr. Kosanovic also owned 
  a disability policy with Great West Life. He was paid $102,400 under that policy 
  because of his disability arising from the accident. Section 2(1)(b) of the 
  Schedule to Uninsured Automobile Coverage (Insurance Act), R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 
  676 as amended ("O. Reg. 676") limits an insurer's liability 
  to the difference between the minimum policy limits and recovery "under 
  any valid policy of insurance". </p>
<p>
  [2] The question on this appeal is whether s. 2(1)(b) of O. Reg. 676 entitles 
  Wawanesa to deduct the money Mr. Kosanovic has received from Great West Life 
  from the $200,000 unidentified driver coverage. On a motion under Rule 22 to 
  determine this question, Kent J. concluded that Wawanesa was not entitled to 
  the deduction. He held that s. 2(1)(b) does not override the common law private 
  insurance exception to the rule against double recovery. Wawanesa appeals. I 
  would allow the appeal, largely for the reasons of this court in Gignac v. Neufeld 
  et al. (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 741. </p>
<p>
  B. Background </p>
<p>
  a. Ontario's Insurance Act: a "threshold no-fault" system 
  of compensation for persons injured in car accidents</p>
<p>
  [3] Since 1990 the Ontario government had enacted various insurance regimes 
  for compensating persons injured in car accidents. These regimes are summarized 
  by my colleague Charron J.A. in her reasons in Gignac. All these regimes share 
  a common characteristic: they implement the no-fault principle and restrict 
  access to the courts. Injured persons are compensated by a variety of statutory 
  accident benefits, without regard to whether they caused the accident. Resort 
  to the court system is limited to cases where the injured person has died or 
  the person's injuries meet a statutory threshold - now "a 
  permanent serious disfigurement" or a "permanent serious impairment 
  of an important physical, mental or psychological function": see the Insurance 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8 s. 267.5 as amended ("the Act"). A person 
  whose injuries meet the threshold may recover non-pecuniary damages, and, depending 
  on the regime, some pecuniary losses. </p>
<p>
  b. Mr. Kosanovic's injuries exceed the threshold and his damages exceed 
  $200,000</p>
<p> [4] The accident in which Mr. Kosanovic was injured occurred during the Bill 
  59 regime, which covers accidents on or after November 1, 1996. Under the Bill 
  59 regime, a person whose injuries meet the threshold can sue for non-pecuniary 
  damages<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> and up to 80 percent of net income 
  loss or net loss of earning capacity. </p>
<p>
  [5] Wawanesa acknowledges that Mr. Kosanovic's injuries from the accident 
  exceed the threshold. He therefore has a tort claim. Wawanesa also acknowledges 
  that a court would assess his damages in an amount exceeding $200,000. </p>
<p>
  c. Unidentified driver coverage under an Ontario car insurance policy limits 
  an insurer's liability to $200,000</p>
<p>
  [6] Because the at-fault driver has never been identified, Mr. Kosanovic's 
  tort claim has no practical value to him. He must look to his own car insurer, 
  Wawanesa, to recover damages for his injuries. The standard Ontario car insurance 
  policy provides a "safety net" for insureds who are injured by an 
  uninsured or unidentified driver: see Gignac. Under the policy an insurer such 
  as Wawanesa is required to pay its own insureds a maximum of $200,000 exclusive 
  of interests and costs for injuries caused by an uninsured or unidentified driver. 
  This uninsured and unidentified driver coverage is mandated by a combination 
  of s. 265(1) of the Act, ss. 1 and 2(1)(a) of O. Reg. 676 and s. 251(1) of the 
  Act.</p>
<p> [7] Section 265(1) of the Act provides that insureds may recover from their 
  own insurer all sums they are legally entitled to recover from an uninsured 
  or unidentified driver as damages for bodily injury, but "subject to the terms, 
  conditions, provisions, exclusions and limits as are prescribed by the regulations." 
  In other words, subject to the regulations, the insurer stands in the shoes 
  of the uninsured or unidentified tortfeasor. Section 1 of O. Reg. 676 states 
  that the Schedule to the regulation applies to payments under s. 265(1) of the 
  Act. Section 2(1)(a) restricts an insurer's liability under 265(1) to the "minimum 
  limits" provided for in s. 251 of the Act. Section 251(1) of the Act sets the 
  minimum limits at $200,000 exclusive of interest and costs. In reality then 
  these "minimum limits" are maximum limits. Mr. Kosanovic can recover against 
  his own insurer, Wawanesa, a maximum of $200,000 exclusive of interest and costs.<a href="#1">[2]</a><a name="r2" id="r2"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  d. The private insurance exception to the rule against double recovery</p>
<p>
  [8] Like many other individuals in society, Mr. Kosanovic supplemented his car 
  insurance coverage by purchasing a disability insurance policy, the Great West 
  Life policy. Great West Life has paid him over $100,000 for the injuries he 
  sustained in the car accident. </p>
<p>
  [9] In cases where injured persons have more than one source of recovery for 
  their losses arising from their injuries, a rational system of compensation 
  ordinarily will seek to avoid overcompensation, and will apply what has become 
  known as the rule against double recovery. However, our courts have carved out 
  an exception to this rule: the common law private insurance exception. The Supreme 
  Court of Canada affirmed this exception in Cunningham v. Wheeler, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 
  359, the case relied on by the motions judge. The rationale for the exception 
  is two-fold: we should encourage individuals to protect themselves and their 
  dependents against disabling injuries and we should not pass on the benefits 
  of their having done so to tortfeasors. Cory J. explained the underpinnings 
  of this exception at paras. 82-83 of his majority reasons in Cunningham: </p>
<p class="indent"> I think the exemption for the private policy of insurance should 
  be maintained. It has a long history. It is understood and accepted. There has 
  never been any confusion as to when it should be applied. More importantly it 
  is based on fairness. All who insure themselves for disability benefits are 
  displaying wisdom and forethought in making provision for the continuation of 
  some income in case of disabling injury or illness. The acquisition of the policy 
  has social benefits for those insured, their dependants and indeed their community. 
  It represents forbearance and self-denial on the part of the purchaser of the 
  policy to provide for contingencies. The individual may never make a claim on 
  the policy and the premiums paid may be a total loss. Yet the policy provides 
  security. </p>
<p class="indent">Recovery in tort is dependent on the plaintiff establishing 
  injury and loss resulting from an act of misfortune or nonfeasance on the part 
  of the defendant, the tortfeasor. I can see no reason why a tortfeasor should 
  benefit from the sacrifices made by a plaintiff in obtaining an insurance policy 
  to provide for lost wages. Tort recovery is based on some wrongdoing. It makes 
  little sense for a wrongdoer to benefit from the private act of forethought 
  and sacrifice of the plaintiff. </p>
<p>
  The application of the private insurance exception permits a person to recover 
  twice for the same injuries: once from the tortfeasor and once from the private 
  insurer.</p>
<p>
  e. Legislatures may eliminate the private insurance exception</p>
<p>
  [10] The private insurance exception is a common law principle. Legislation 
  may override it. As Cory J. recognized in Cunningham, Ontario has done so for 
  car accident compensation by enacting a number of provisions to eliminate double 
  recovery. For example, s. 267.8(1)2 provides that a tort award for income loss 
  or loss of earning capacity shall be reduced by any payments the injured person 
  has received or that were available for income loss or loss of earning capacity. 
  </p>
<p>
  [11] The Ontario government has also passed Regulation 676. Section 2(1)(b) 
  of that regulation - which is central to this appeal - is another 
  provision intended to prevent double recovery. It does so by reducing an insurer's 
  obligation to pay under the uninsured and unidentified driver coverage by the 
  money an insured person has received under a valid policy of insurance. The 
  question on this appeal is whether s. 2(1)(b) entitles Wawanesa to pay Mr. Kosanovic 
  only $97,000 instead of $200,000. In other words, to deduct from the minimum 
  limits of $200,000 the $102,400, Mr. Kosanovic has received from Great West 
  Life. </p>
<p>
  C. Does Wawanesa owe Mr. Kosanovic $200,000 or $97,600?</p>
<p>
  [12] Section 2(1)(b) of O. Reg. 676 provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  2. (1) The insurer shall not be liable to make any payment,</p>
<p class="center">
  . . . </p><p class="indent">
  (b) where a person insured under the contract is entitled to recover money under 
  any valid policy of insurance other than money payable on death, except for 
  the difference between such entitlement and the relevant minimum limits determined 
  under clause (a)</p>
<p>
  [13] The motions judge acknowledged that "at first blush" s. 2(1)(b) 
  "appears to be conclusive" and entitles Wawanesa to the deduction. 
  He concluded, however, that s. 2(1)(b) had not eliminated the common law private 
  insurance exception because the common law could not be changed by "[a]nything 
  less than a clear and express provision in a statute". </p>
<p>
  [14] In my view, that conclusion is untenable. Section 2(1)(b) draws its statutory 
  authority from s. 265(1) of the Act, the statutory provision that addresses 
  uninsured and unidentified automobile coverage. Section 265(1)(a) states: </p>
<p class="indent"> 265 (1) Every contract evidenced by a motor vehicle liability 
  policy shall provide for payment of all sums that, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) a person insured under the contract is legally entitled 
  to recover from the owner or driver of an uninsured automobile or unidentified 
  automobile as damages for bodily injuries resulting from an accident involving 
  an automobile;</p>
<p class="indent">subject to the terms, conditions, provisions, exclusions and 
  limits as are prescribed by the regulations. </p>
<p>
  [15] This court has said consistently that where the legislature makes contractual 
  entitlement subject to "the terms, conditions, provisions, exclusions 
  and limits" prescribed in a regulation, the court must look to the regulation 
  to determine entitlement. The statute does not prevail over the regulation. 
  They must be read together. Thus, the common law can be abrogated by statute, 
  or where the statute so authorizes - as it has under s. 265(1) of the 
  Act - by regulation: see Warwick v. Gore Mutual Insurance Co. (1997), 
  32 O.R. (3d) 76 (C.A.) and Alchimowicz v. Continental Insurance Co. of Canada 
  (1996), 22 M.V.R. (3d) 41 (Ont. C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [16] Mr. Kosanovic's Great West Life policy is a "valid policy of 
  insurance" under s. 2(1)(b) of O. Reg. 676. On a plain reading of its 
  terms s. 2(1)(b) authorizes Wawanesa to deduct from the amount it must pay to 
  Mr. Kosanovic, the amount he received from Great West Life. Doing so would prevent 
  double recovery out of the money available under the unidentified driver coverage. 
  Put differently, the private law insurance exception would not apply when an 
  insured such as Mr. Kosanovic seeks compensation from the safety net provided 
  by his own insurer under the standard car insurance policy.</p>
<p>
  [17] However, case law from this court has qualified the insurer's right 
  to a deduction under s. 2(1)(b) of O. Reg. 676 in two ways. Our court has done 
  so by interpreting s. 2(1)(b) in the light of its purpose, to prevent double 
  recovery. Unfortunately for Mr. Kosanovic neither qualification applies in his 
  case. </p>
<p>
  [18] The first qualification is reflected in the colloquial phrase (referred 
  to by Mr. Kosanovic's counsel in his factum) "apples should be deducted 
  from apples". So, for example, in Quiroz v. Wallace (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 
  737, Charron J.A. held that s. 2(1)(b) did not entitle an insurer to deduct 
  from the minimum limits for uninsured driver coverage statutory no-fault benefits 
  paid to the insured. The car accident in Quiroz occurred during the Bill 164 
  regime, under which an injured person who met the threshold could sue only for 
  non-pecuniary loss. Thus, the $200,000 policy limits for uninsured driver coverage 
  represented non-pecuniary damages. The no-fault benefits represented compensation 
  for pecuniary losses. Because the payments represented different heads of damages 
  the insured would not be overcompensated by receiving both payments. Permitting 
  a deduction would have been inconsistent with the underlying purpose of s. 2(1)(b), 
  which is to prevent double recovery. In Bannon v. McNeely (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 
  659 (C.A.) Finlayson J.A. applied similar reasoning to deductions from tort 
  awards. </p>
<p>
  [19] This qualification to the wording of s. 2(1)(b) of O. Reg. 676 does not 
  assist Mr. Kosanovic. Under the Bill 59 regime an injured person can sue for 
  both pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses. Thus the $200,000 minimum policy limits 
  reflect both heads of damages. Moreover, as I will discuss, the Great West Life 
  payments were not payments for pecuniary loss, as Mr. Kosanovic's eligibility 
  to receive them did not depend on his being employed at the time of the accident. 
  </p>
<p>
  [20] The second qualification is that the money paid by Great West Life cannot 
  be deducted twice. This qualification emerges from Gignac. In that case, decided 
  under the Bill 68 regime, the plaintiff, Ms. Gignac, was seriously injured when 
  the car in which she was a passenger was hit by another car, which was uninsured. 
  The court assumed that she met the threshold for suing in tort and that her 
  damages exceeded the minimum limits of $200,000 to which she was entitled from 
  State Farm, the insurer of the car in which she was a passenger. Ms. Gignac 
  maintained her own car insurance policy with another insurer, and her policy 
  included "SEF44 underinsured motorist coverage". Under this coverage 
  her own insurer had paid her statutory no-fault benefits. The issue on the appeal 
  was whether s. 2(1)(b) of O. Reg. 676 permitted State Farm to deduct the no-fault 
  payments from the $200,000 that it would otherwise be required to pay Ms. Gignac. 
  </p>
<p>
  [21] Although the no-fault benefits were paid under "a valid policy of 
  insurance" this court held that State Farm was not entitled to the deduction. 
  The reason was that s. 267(1) of the former Act required that these no-fault 
  benefits be deducted from the tort award for which, under s. 265(1) of the Act, 
  State Farm stood in the shoes of the uninsured driver. Section 267(1) of the 
  Act provided: </p>
<p class="indent"> 267(1) The damages awarded to a person in a proceeding for 
  loss or damage arising directly or indirectly from the use or operation of an 
  automobile shall be reduced by,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) all payments that the person has received or that were or 
  are available for no-fault benefits and by the present value of any no-fault 
  benefits to which the person is entitled. </p>
<p>
  [22] Charron J.A concluded that, as the no-fault benefits were deducted from 
  the tort award, they could not be deducted again under s. 2(1)(b) of O. Reg. 
  676. She wrote at 750-751: </p>
<p class="indent"> If State Farm's position were adopted, the no-fault benefits 
  would be deducted first under s. 267(1) and then again under s. 2(1)(b) of Reg. 
  676, resulting in a double deduction. It would also lead to the result that, 
  in circumstances like those in this appeal, mandatory uninsured coverage is 
  illusory and worthless. It is not clear to me that the legislature intended 
  this result. I think, rather, that the interpretation urged by State Farm leads 
  to an absurd result and should be avoided if possible. </p>
<p class="indent">When read in context, I am of the view that it is reasonable 
  to interpret s. 2(1)(b) of Reg. 676 as requiring that a deduction be made from 
  the uninsured motorist coverage only for those no-fault benefits that have not 
  already been deducted under s. 267(1). This is the only interpretation that 
  achieves the dual purpose of preventing double recovery and providing compensation 
  to the most severely injured from the tortfeasor (or, alternatively, from the 
  insurance provider who steps in the shoes of the tortfeasor under the uninsured 
  motorist coverage). </p>
<p>
  [23] Charron J.A. so concluded even though Ms. Gignac could not recover more 
  than $200,000 from State Farm, and likely had no prospect of recovering the 
  tort award from the owner or driver of the uninsured car. </p>
<p>
  [24] In Mr. Kosanovic's case the prospect of a double deduction does not 
  arise. The only provision of the Act that might permit a deduction from the 
  admittedly notional tort award is s. 267.8(1) 2, which I have referred to earlier 
  and which provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  267.8(1) In an action for loss or damage from bodily injury or death arising 
  directly or indirectly from the use or operation of an automobile, the damages 
  to which a plaintiff is entitled for income loss and loss of earning capacity 
  shall be reduced by the following amounts: </p>
<p class="center"> . . . </p>
<p class="indent">2. All payments in respect of the incident that the plaintiff 
  has received or that were available before the trial of the action for income 
  loss or loss of earning capacity under the laws of any jurisdiction or under 
  an income continuation benefit plan. </p>
<p>
  [25] Payments under the Great West Life policy do not meet the statutory criteria 
  for a deduction under s. 267.8(1) 2 of the Act. Mr. Kosanovic did not have to 
  be employed at the time of the accident to receive disability benefits under 
  his policy. The payments to him did not depend on his suffering an income loss 
  and he did not have to prove an income loss to receive them. Because the payments 
  Mr. Kosanovic received from Great West Life cannot be deducted from a tort award 
  they are properly deducted under s. 2(1)(b) of O. Reg. 676 from the minimum 
  policy limits of $200,000 for which Wawanesa is liable. </p>
<p>
  [26] Indeed, the disability payments Mr. Kosanovic received from Great West 
  Life are akin to the Canada Pension Plan disability benefits Ms. Gignac received, 
  which Charron J.A. held could be deducted under s. 2(1)(b) of O. Reg. 676. The 
  CPP benefits were payable whether or not Ms. Gignac was employed when she became 
  disabled. Therefore they were not "payments... for loss of income" 
  and were not deductible from the damages award. Deducting them under s. 2(1)(b) 
  would not produce a double deduction. </p>
<p>
  [27] Mr. Kosanovic makes two submissions to avoid the reasoning in Gignac. First, 
  he seeks to distinguish it on the ground that unlike the Great West Life policy, 
  the CPP is not privately paid insurance. I accept this difference between the 
  two kinds of insurance, but this difference is not relevant to the application 
  of s. 2(1)(b) of O. Reg. 676. Both CPP payments and the Great West Life payments 
  are payments under a valid policy of insurance. Neither can be deducted from 
  the damages award. Both, therefore, can be deducted under s. 2(1)(b).</p>
<p>
  [28] Second, Mr. Kosanovic submits that the legislature could not have intended 
  that seriously injured persons who have the foresight to buy their own insurance 
  should be denied compensation from their unidentified driver coverage. In Gignac, 
  Charron J.A. considered and rejected a similar argument on the ground that the 
  deduction under s. 2(1)(b) gives effect to the legislative intent to prevent 
  double recovery (at 754-755): </p>
<p class="indent">
  Finally, the appellant argues that the legislature could not have intended that 
  the very seriously injured who receive CPP benefits in excess of $200,000 receive 
  no compensation from the uninsured coverage. In my view, this possible result 
  does not detract from the clear intent to prevent double recovery. The deduction 
  of CPP disability benefits under s. 2(1)(b) of Reg. 676 does prevent double 
  recovery where, as in this case, disability benefits are payable as a consequence 
  of the accident. </p>
<p>
  [29] I add to her observations these two observations of my own. Although Wawanesa 
  nominally stands in the place of an unidentified tortfeasor, it is not a tortfeasor. 
  Therefore, a main rationale for maintaining the private insurance exception 
  to the rule against double recovery - a tortfeasor should not benefit 
  from an insured's prudence and foresight - does not apply here. 
  Instead, Wawanesa's unidentified driver coverage provides a safety net 
  to its insureds. Looked at from this perspective, giving effect to the rule 
  against double recovery by deducting the Great West Life payments is more understandable. 
  </p>
<p>
  [30] Some of the results of applying the various insurance regimes seem anomalous. 
  Perhaps that is the case here. Whether Mr. Kosanovic is entitled to $200,000 
  or $97,600 from Wawanesa turns on whether he can deduct the Great West Life 
  payments from a tort award that is notional at best, because he can never realize 
  on it. These results, however, are driven by the statutory and regulatory provisions 
  of Ontario's insurance regimes. The judgments of Charron J.A. in Quiroz 
  and Gignac and Finlayson J.A. in Bannon sought to ameliorate some of the unfairness 
  that would be caused by a literal reading of these provisions. They have done 
  so by interpreting these provisions in the light of their purpose, which is 
  to reduce or eliminate double recovery. Nonetheless, provisions such as s. 2(1)(b) 
  of O. Reg. 676 have to be given some meaning. The ruling of the motions judge 
  and the position of Mr. Kosanovic would render s. 2(1)(b) meaningless. </p>
<p>
  D. Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [31] I therefore conclude that Wawanesa must pay Mr. Kosanovic $97,600 not $200,000. 
  I would allow the appeal by striking out paragraph 1 of the order of the motions 
  judge and substituting the following paragraph: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1.This court declares that the defendant is entitled to deduct the payments 
  received by the plaintiff from Great West Life from the minimum policy limits. 
  </p>
<p>
  [32] Wawanesa is entitled to its costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity 
  basis. I would fix those costs in the amount agreed on by counsel, $6,000 inclusive 
  of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
