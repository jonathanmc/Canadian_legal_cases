<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from the judgment of the Summary Conviction Appeal 
  Court Judge ("SCAJ") dismissing his appeal for lack of merit on July 
  21, 1999. The appellant was convicted of possession of .22 calibre ammunition 
  while prohibited pursuant to an order under s. 100(2) and contrary to s. 100(12) 
  of the Criminal Code. </p>
<p>
  [2] The relevant part of s. 100(2), as it then was, reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> When an offender is convicted or discharged under section 736 
  of</p>
<p class="indent">(a) an offence involving the use, carriage, possession, handling 
  or storage of any firearm or ammunition,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) an offence, other than an offence referred to in subsection 
  (1), in the commission of which violence against a person was used, threatened 
  or attempted, or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) an offence described in subsection 39(1) or (2) or 48(1) 
  or (2) of the Food and Drugs Act or in subsection 4(1) or (2) or 5(1) of the 
  Narcotic Control Act,</p>
<p class="indent">the court that sentences the offender, in addition to any other 
  punishment that may be imposed for the offence, shall consider whether it is 
  desirable, in the interests of the safety of the offender or of any other person, 
  to make an order prohibiting the offender from possessing any firearm or any 
  ammunition or explosive substance and ordering the offender to surrender any 
  firearms acquisition certificate that the offender possesses....</p>
<p>
  [3] Section 100 (12) states: </p>
<p class="indent"> Every one who has in his possession any firearm or any ammunition 
  or explosive substance while he is prohibited from doing so by any order made 
  pursuant to this section </p>
<p class="indent">(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment 
  for a term not exceeding ten years; or </p>
<p class="indent">(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction. 
</p>
<p>[4] On July 22, 1997, the police executed a search warrant on 
  the appellant's premises on the basis that the appellant was advocating the 
  genocide of Jews contrary to s. 318 of the Criminal Code. In the process of 
  executing this warrant, the police discovered a box of .22 calibre ammunition 
  in a locked gun cabinet in the appellant's bedroom. The appellant had the key 
  to the cabinet. Because the appellant was subject to an order made pursuant 
  to s. 100(2), the police charged him under s. 100(12) with breaching that order. 
</p>
<p>
  [5] The Crown proved the order by filing a certified copy of it with the court 
  as an exhibit. It was discovered that the prohibition order, made in February 
  1994, did not comply with s. 100(13). The relevant portion of that section states: </p>
<p class="indent"> (13) An order made pursuant to subsection (2) &#133;shall</p>
<p class="indent">(a) specify a reasonable period within which the person against 
  whom the order is made may surrender to a police officer or firearms officer 
  &#133;any ammunition&#133;possessed by that person prior to the making of the 
  order and during which subsection (12) does not apply to that person; </p>
<p>[6] At the close of the Crown's case at trial, the appellant 
  brought a motion for non-suit on the basis that the prohibition order was void 
  because it did not comply with s. 100(13). The trial judge noted that this section 
  only speaks to ammunition that is in the accused's possession at the time the 
  order was made. As a result, he held that the order might be invalid insofar 
  as any ammunition that was lawfully in the accused's possession at the time 
  the order was made, but it would be valid in respect of ammunition acquired 
  thereafter. The trial judge ruled that in the face of evidence that the ammunition 
  was lawfully in the possession of the accused at the time of the order, he "&#133;wouldn't 
  be prepared to make a finding of guilt because the section is mandatory and 
  if it is not complied with I think that the order is void insofar as any of 
  that ammunition goes".</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant then testified that he had not seen the ammunition in the 
  cabinet and that he had not opened the cabinet at any time between February 
  1994 and his arrest in 1997. He said that he had not owned any ammunition since 
  his conviction and the prohibition order. He had a key to the cabinet but the 
  other key had been lost. He further testified that the bullets must have been 
  left over from the previous search that resulted in the prohibition order. The 
  appellant's mother testified that she placed the ammunition in the cabinet the 
  day before the search warrant was executed.</p>
<p>
  [8] The trial judge found that the cabinet was in the appellant's room, that 
  it was locked and that he had the key. The picture taken of the bullets in the 
  cabinet showed that the bullets were very visible. He made reference to the 
  contradiction in the evidence of the mother and her son and rejected the appellant's 
  explanation for the presence of the ammunition.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant appealed his conviction and his appeal was dismissed for lack 
  of merit. He unsuccessfully sought to raise the issue of the validity of the 
  s. 100 order on his appeal before the SCAJ who does not appear to have understood 
  that this is what the appellant was doing. </p>
<p>
  [10] Before this court, the appellant raises three issues: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1) Whether the s. 100 order was valid;</p>
<p class="indent">2) Whether the Crown proved the actus reus of the offence charged; 
  and </p>
<p class="indent">3) Whether the trial judge reversed the burden of proof by requiring 
  the appellant to show that he purchased the ammunition before February 1994. 
</p>
<p>
  [11] The weight of judicial authority is that the s. 100 order was valid. In 
  R. v. Avery (1986), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 16 (N.W.T.C.A.), the majority held that the 
  appellant could not defend a charge of violating a prohibition order under s. 
  100 on the basis that the original order was defective. By challenging the validity 
  of the original order the appellant was mounting a collateral attack on it. 
  Once a court order has been made, it cannot be impeached other than by directly 
  attacking it, such as by way of an appeal, moving to set it aside or by invoking 
  one of the prerogative writs, unless the error is so extreme that the court 
  is compelled to find that the whole matter is a violation of the first principles 
  of justice: Wilson v. The Queen (1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 104 (S.C.C.) per 
  Dickson J., and Tufts v. Thomson, [1929] 1 D.L.R. 896 at 899 (Man. C.A.), followed 
  respectively in Avery, supra, at 26 and 29. The decisions of the Quebec Court 
  of Appeal in R. v. Desjardins (1993), A.Q. No. 2046 and the Alberta Court of 
  Appeal in R. v. Funk, [1995] A.J. No. 623 follow Avery, supra. Accordingly, 
  we would dismiss the first ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  [12] The second ground of appeal is, assuming the appellant was in possession 
  of the ammunition at the time of the order, that the Crown did not prove the 
  actus reus of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt because no reasonable time 
  limit for disposing of the ammunition is stated in the order. In the circumstances 
  of this case, the fact that the appellant was found to still be in possession 
  of the ammunition some three years after the date of the prohibition order is 
  sufficient to establish that he is beyond any reasonable time limit for the 
  disposition of ammunition that would have been specified in the prohibition 
  order. For this reason, we would also dismiss the second ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  [13] Lastly, the trial judge did not reverse the burden of proof. The trial 
  judge's misapprehension of the law respecting the validity of the order led 
  him to confer a benefit on the appellant, as it was his understanding that the 
  appellant would have a justification or excuse for possessing the ammunition 
  if he had the ammunition in his possession prior to the prohibition order being 
  made. At this stage of the trial, on the correct interpretation of the law, 
  the Crown had already established a prima facie case that cried out for an explanation 
  from the appellant or he risked being convicted. At its highest, the trial judge 
  placed an evidentiary burden on the appellant to introduce some evidence as 
  to the timing of his possession of the ammunition. In the circumstances, no 
  substantial harm or miscarriage of justice was occasioned. </p>
<p>
  [14] At the outset of this appeal, the appellant brought a motion to introduce 
  as fresh evidence a letter from the manufacturer of the ammunition to the effect 
  that its date of manufacture was April 24, 1991 and his own affidavit that it 
  is unlikely he would have been able to purchase the ammunition after the date 
  of the prohibition order, "because the lot number would have been sold 
  out within a short period of time." The proposed fresh evidence is an attempt 
  to challenge the adverse findings of credibility made by the trial judge and 
  dismissed by the SCAJ that the appellant was in possession of the ammunition 
  at the time the prohibition order was made. However, the proposed fresh evidence 
  fails to meet the requirements for the admissibility of fresh evidence: it is 
  evidence that could have been obtained by the appellant prior to his trial through 
  the exercise of due diligence; its reliability is dependent on our acceptance 
  of the appellant's affidavit; and the interests of justice do not require that 
  it be admitted. The motion to admit fresh evidence is dismissed. We further 
  observe that had the fresh evidence been admissible, it does not establish when, 
  or from whom, the appellant purchased the ammunition. </p>
<p> [15] Finally, the information alleges that the appellant had in his possession 
  ammunition while he was prohibited from doing so, &quot;by reason of an order 
  pursuant to s. 100(1)&quot;, not s. 100 (2) of the Criminal Code. Exercising 
  our power under s. 683(1)(g) of the Criminal Code, we amend the order to read 
  s. 100(2). There is no prejudice to the appellant as a result of the amendment, 
  as all proceedings were conducted on the basis of this being a breach of s. 
  100(2). We note that no issue was raised before the trial judge or the SCAJ 
  in this regard. </p>
<p>
  [16] The appellant's appeal against conviction is dismissed.</p>
