<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice B.W. Hurley of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated June 22, 2001. </p>
<p> SIMMONS J.A.: </p>
<p> [1] Shortly after 6 p.m. on January 26, 1999, Alfred Martin, an inmate at 
  the Kingston Penitentiary, was stabbed to death in a confrontation with fellow 
  prisoners. As a result of the killing, Pierre Carrierre and the respondents 
  Robert Simpson and Donald LaKing were jointly charged with second-degree murder 
  and subsequently tried by Hurley J., sitting without a jury.</p>
<p> [2] Following a nineteen-day trial, at which none of the defendants testified, 
  the trial judge acquitted all the accused based on the following findings: </p>
<p class="indent">i) Carrierre did not participate in the physical confrontation 
  that led to Martin's death; </p>
<p class="indent">ii) LaKing did not cause life-threatening injuries to Martin 
  when he hit him on the head repeatedly with a right-angled metal wall bracket; 
</p>
<p class="indent">iii) Simpson alone stabbed Martin, causing his death; </p>
<p class="indent">iv) Simpson and LaKing were not acting in concert during the 
  course of the physical confrontation; and </p>
<p class="indent">v) Simpson and LaKing were acting in lawful self-defence when 
  they, respectively, stabbed and struck Martin. In the result, all three of the 
  accused were acquitted. </p>
<p> [3] The Crown appeals from Simpson and LaKing's acquittals, claiming that 
  the trial judge erred in two respects in finding that there was an air of reality 
  to their respective claims of self-defence: first, in holding that words alone 
  can constitute an assault, and second, in finding an evidentiary basis for the 
  subjective elements of self-defence. In the alternative, if there was an air 
  of reality to the self-defence claims, the Crown submits that the trial judge 
  erred in assessing the subjective elements of the defence.</p>
<p> [4] During the appeal hearing, we quashed the Crown's appeal against LaKing's 
  acquittal. We accepted LaKing's submission that, as the result of the trial 
  judge's finding that he and Simpson were not acting in concert, the only offences 
  for which LaKing could have been convicted at trial were assault with a weapon, 
  assault causing bodily harm, or aggravated assault. Because none of these offences 
  are included offences on a charge of second-degree murder and because the Crown 
  did not appeal the trial judge's finding that Simpson and LaKing were not acting 
  in concert, we concluded that it was not open to the Crown to appeal from LaKing's 
  acquittal. </p>
<p> [5] For the reasons that follow, I would also dismiss the Crown's appeal against 
  Simpson's acquittal.</p>
<p> I. Background</p>
<p> i) the events of January 26, 1999</p>
<p> a) background to the stabbing</p>
<p> [6] Early in the morning of January 26, 1999, Martin began drinking homemade 
  liquor (&quot;shine&quot;) with X, a fellow inmate and friend. X made the shine 
  so that he and Martin could trade it for heroin. However, when the two men were 
  unable to find any heroin, they started drinking the shine themselves and also 
  shared a morphine pill.</p>
<p> [7] Correctional officers first took particular note of Martin's behaviour 
  on January 26, 1999, at around 3:15 p.m. At that time, Martin was in the dome 
  area of Kingston Penitentiary. </p>
<p> [8] Kingston Penitentiary is shaped like a wheel, with a large hub (&quot;dome&quot;) 
  in the centre and ranges of cells running out like spokes from the dome. Martin 
  was housed in a range of cells referred to as Upper G Range. Upper G Range is 
  located on the third and fourth floors of the penitentiary. The fourth floor 
  of Upper G Range consists of about 20 cells, a catwalk about 30 inches wide 
  in front of the cells, and a railing along the outer limit of the catwalk. There 
  is an open space of approximately 20 feet in front of the cells on the third 
  floor and the outer wall of the penitentiary. The ceiling of the open space 
  is above the ceiling of the cells on the fourth floor. A staircase near the 
  dome connects the two levels of the range. </p>
<p> [9] Correctional officers observe the inmates in Upper G Range from a two-storey 
  control post (&quot;bubble&quot;) at the dome end of the range. Alongside the 
  bubble, there is a door leading into the dome (&quot;barrier&quot;). Correctional 
  officers control access to the dome via the barrier from the bubble.</p>
<p> [10] At around 3:15 p.m., Martin presented in the dome as intoxicated and 
  belligerent. He was challenging the correctional officers to a fight, insulting 
  them and calling them racists. Some correctional officers described Martin as 
  frothing at the mouth. However, a senior correctional officer was able to calm 
  him down, and ultimately returned him to the range after determining that he 
  did not appear to be a danger.</p>
<p> [11] A short time later, at approximately 3:48 p.m., Martin became involved 
  in a physical altercation with Simpson. At least one inmate said the altercation 
  began as horseplay, i.e. the two men were slapping each other, open-handed, 
  not hard, and both were smiling. However, within a short time, they started 
  hitting each other harder and throwing punches. Various witnesses reported Simpson 
  as telling Martin, &quot; I got no problems with you... I don't want to fight&quot;. 
</p>
<p> [12] X testified that he was sitting with Simpson and Carrierre when the fighting 
  started. He said that Martin threatened to kill them, and that he had been threatening 
  all of them most of the day.</p>
<p> [13] The altercation between Martin and Simpson was captured in part by a 
  stationary video camera located above a washer and dryer at the far end of the 
  range. The video shows Martin pushing, punching and jabbing Simpson, and Simpson 
  kicking Martin. At one point, Carrierre attempted to intervene. The altercation 
  ended quickly with Martin and Simpson hugging for the benefit of correctional 
  staff, and with Simpson kissing Martin. The video also indicates that, after 
  the incident appeared to have ended, Martin sucker-punched Simpson and that 
  for about fifty minutes after the altercation ended, Simpson and Martin continued 
  to exchange words intermittently. </p>
<p> [14] Following the altercation, the Acting Unit Manager for Upper G Range 
  asked Martin to agree to go to segregation. However, he refused unless she could 
  guarantee that he would be released the next day. Martin claimed that he and 
  Simpson were just playing and Simpson confirmed that. The Acting Unit Manager 
  left, feeling that it would be too dangerous to remove Martin from the range 
  at that time, but planning to deal with him after the evening lock-down. </p>
<p> [15] The next significant event happened at approximately 4:39 p.m. After 
  a brief exchange of words, Martin pulled a 6-8 inch weapon resembling an ice 
  pick and backed Carrierre up to the end of the range, threatening him with the 
  weapon. The confrontation took place underneath the video camera, and therefore 
  was not filmed. Soon after the confrontation began, LaKing yelled at Martin 
  to stop. LaKing went into his cell, grabbed a knife and started walking towards 
  Martin. The two men squared off, and started swiping at each other with their 
  knives. Following an interlude, they moved towards the stairs. LaKing backed 
  up the stairs while Martin moved towards him. Part way up the stairs, Martin 
  either dropped his knife or threw it over the railing. LaKing kicked or pushed 
  Martin away and then left the area. Once again, various witnesses described 
  Martin as being the aggressor and LaKing as telling Martin to back off.</p>
<p> [16] The Acting Unit Manager heard about the knife-swinging incident and ordered 
  the inmates on Upper G Range to lock themselves in their cells. Not uncommonly, 
  they refused. She spoke to Martin a second time. He denied that there had been 
  an altercation and refused to lock up. He said he would give the staff a reason 
  to lock up the range, and threatened to set up a barricade, cause disturbances 
  and start a fire. </p>
<p> [17] Correctional officers notified the Emergency Response Team of the situation. 
  Various inmates and prison officials testified that, in the circumstances, the 
  guards were not going to enter the range unless the inmates were locked down.</p>
<p> [18] Another inmate (whom I will refer to as the second witness to the fatal 
  confrontation) testified that after the fight on the stairs, he spoke to Simpson 
  and LaKing in LaKing's cell. Simpson and LaKing told him they wanted to &quot;squash&quot; 
  the incident, which he understood meant resolving the problem without further 
  violence. They also told him that they were worried that Martin still wanted 
  to fight and that they were &quot;paranoid&quot; about his weapon. The inmate 
  testified that he went to Martin's cell, retrieved his knife, and then returned 
  to LaKing 's cell. He said he told LaKing that he had Martin's knife and that 
  he showed the knife to Simpson and LaKing. In cross-examination, the inmate 
  indicated that Simpson may have been present when he told LaKing that he had 
  Martin's knife. However, he said that he could not recall if he showed the knife 
  to Simpson and LaKing. He testified that he disposed of the knife by putting 
  it into a shampoo bottle and then into the garbage.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
</p>
<p> [19] X also testified concerning the likelihood that Martin was armed. He 
  said that he met with Martin in Martin's cell after the knife fight. He saw 
  the knife Martin had been using on Martin's desk and never saw Martin give it 
  to anyone else.</p>
<p> [20] At 6:05 p.m., Martin started a fire. He broke various items (including 
  a counter bolted to the floor), gathered them near the door and ignited them. 
  He was yelling for other inmates to help him. Apart from X, no one else joined 
  in. At one point, Martin threw an accelerant on the fire, and it rose to about 
  five or six feet. The sprinkler system came on and extinguished the fire within 
  three or four minutes, but a fair amount of water accumulated on the floor.</p>
<p> [21] A few minutes after the fire was set, X jumped on to the washer and then 
  the dryer and covered the video camera with a towel. He testified that Martin 
  told him to cover the camera because he (Martin) was going to &quot;kill those 
  goofs&quot;.</p>
<p> [22] After the video camera was covered, LaKing called out to Simpson and 
  pointed at the covered camera. Simpson then went upstairs to the fourth floor 
  and into LaKing's cell. </p>
<p> [23] At around 6:14 p.m. a correctional officer began operating a hand held 
  video camera from the bubble. At approximately 6:15 p.m., X covered the bubble 
  window. By 6:19 p.m., Martin had been fatally stabbed.</p>
<p> b) the stabbing</p>
<p> 1.) the first witness' version </p>
<p> [24] Two inmates witnessed the confrontation in which Martin was killed. The 
  first witness testified that LaKing called Martin over to the vicinity of LaKing's 
  cell and said, &quot;[w]hat's your problem? You've got to stop doing this. You're 
  always drinking and causing problems&quot;. Martin responded, &quot;[s]o what? 
  I was drunk. Do you want to continue this?&quot; The two men stared at each 
  other. Martin called out to X, &quot;X get my knife&quot;. X went into Martin's 
  cell, and within a few moments, replied, &quot;I can't find it, Alfie.&quot;<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a></p>
<p> [25] LaKing then shoved Martin towards the railing. Within a couple of seconds, 
  Simpson pulled out a knife and stabbed Martin several times in the chest and 
  abdomen. Martin began to stumble backwards. As Martin was moving backwards, 
  LaKing hit him on the head and shoulders with some sort of a metal pipe. Carrierre 
  either grabbed Martin or pushed him, and then stepped aside. Martin staggered 
  down the stairs and then collapsed on the floor at the bottom of the stairs</p>
<p> [26] After some time had passed, correctional officers ordered the inmates 
  away from the barrier and took Martin away. Simpson washed his knife, threw 
  it out the window and then changed his clothes. Simpson called X upstairs, punched 
  him in the face and told X he was lucky that he hadn't killed him.</p>
<p> 2.) the second witness' version</p>
<p> [27] The second witness testified that he spoke to Martin on the fourth floor 
  and that, after that, Martin went to LaKing's cell. Martin wanted to know if 
  LaKing wanted to fight. The second witness then saw Simpson go towards LaKing's 
  cell. Martin asked Simpson if he wanted to fight him. Simpson began criticizing 
  Martin for his actions that day and Martin got upset. He said something like, 
  &quot;[w]ell you know, if we're going to fight, then let's get it over with, 
  and fight. If we're not, then let's just not.&quot;</p>
<p> [28] Simpson repeated that he thought Martin was wrong. Martin replied: </p>
<p class="indent"> Listen, if you want to fight, then let's just fight it out 
  now. I know that you were paranoid about me having a knife. You know I don't 
  have a knife, so if you want to fight it out, we can just fight it out. I just 
  want to go back to my cell.</p>
<p> [29] Simpson then went into LaKing's cell. Martin reiterated, &quot;[i]f you 
  want to fight then let's fight. If you're not going to fight then just say so&quot;. 
  Martin held out his hands and said, &quot;I've got no knife&quot;. Simpson came 
  out of LaKing's cell and walked over to the railing. Martin did not stop talking, 
  he wanted to know what they were going to do. Simpson walked towards the cell 
  and faced the doorway and Martin. He stabbed Martin twice in the chest. Within 
  a few moments, LaKing started hitting Martin over the head with a bent bar. 
  Martin and LaKing started running down the range, and LaKing kept swinging the 
  bar. Martin went down the stairs, and then stumbled and collapsed as he reached 
  the bottom.</p>
<p> [30] The first witness testified that after the fight he heard Simpson say 
  that he had been acting in self-defence because Martin tried to stabbed him. 
  He said: </p>
<p class="indent"> ... I remember Bobby Simpson yelling out to everybody that, 
  &quot; you don't have to talk to the police. Everybody knows what happened. 
  I stabbed him in self-defence.</p>
<p class="indent">iii) evidence of Martin's violent disposition</p>
<p> [31] With the consent of the Crown, counsel for Simpson filed material at 
  trial containing details of Martin's disposition for violence. This material 
  indicated that Martin had at least 10 convictions for violent offences between 
  1979 and 1990. In addition, various prison officials and inmates testified about 
  Martin's disposition and reputation for violence.</p>
<p> II. The Crown's position at trial</p>
<p> [32] In closing submissions at trial, the Crown took the position that the 
  evidence did not lend an air of reality to the claim of self-defence for three 
  reasons. First, the evidence of the first witness to the fatal stabbing was 
  the most reliable and demonstrated that, once the camera was covered, the defendants 
  carried out a planned attack on an unarmed man. In particular, he submitted 
  that the first witness's evidence demonstrated that LaKing beckoned both Simpson 
  and Martin to LaKing's cell and that all three defendants knew X had been unable 
  to find Martin's knife. </p>
<p> [33] Second, the atmosphere on the range on January 26, 1999 was not that 
  different from any other day, and certainly was not an atmosphere of extreme 
  fear as suggested by the defence. Crown counsel submitted that the evidence 
  showed that the range was basically calm until 3 p.m. and that the subsequent 
  confrontations were of relatively short duration and not sufficient to create 
  a reasonable apprehension that Martin might kill someone. In particular, the 
  altercation between Simpson and Martin was not one-sided. Moreover, Simpson's 
  subsequent behaviour was not that of a frightened man. </p>
<p> [34] Crown counsel submitted that the fire was a face-saving gesture designed 
  to give Martin an out to go to segregation and suggested that the camera was 
  covered so that other inmates could become involved in the smash-up. He said 
  that the evidence of Martin's disposition indicated that he was a bully, but 
  that there was relatively little evidence of him following through on his bluster. 
  Finally, he submitted that there were many alternatives available to Simpson 
  other than stabbing Martin. </p>
<p> [35] Third, Crown counsel pointed out that there was no evidence of the state 
  of mind of the accused.</p>
<p> III. The trial judge's findings</p>
<p> [36] Before turning to Simpson's claim of self-defence, the trial judge made 
  three important preliminary findings.</p>
<p>
  [37] First, that Martin was the aggressor in the three incidents leading up 
  to the stabbing and that, in each case, &quot; the other party to [the incident] 
  sought at least a modicum of peace, and declared that he did not want to fight&quot;. 
  Second, that on January 26, 1999, Martin was drinking throughout the day, and 
  became increasingly intoxicated as the day wore on. Third, on the basis of the 
  evidence of Martin's disposition for violence, that he was a &quot;loud, truculent 
  bully, who would, on occasion, and unpredictably, resort to violence to get 
  his way or even to satisfy a whim&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [38] In finding that there was an air of reality to Simpson's claim of self-defence 
  under s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, the trial judge relied 
  on his preliminary findings, on the events of the day and the resulting atmosphere 
  on the range (including the fact that the guards were unlikely to enter the 
  range unless the inmates were locked down), and on Martin's demeanour and conduct 
  immediately prior to his death. The trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent"> The first issue to be determined is whether self-defence was 
  a live issue in this case. </p>
<p class="indent">There is some evidence bearing on that issue. The stabbing occurred 
  in Kingston Penitentiary. The barrier door was locked. There was some tension 
  on the range. Martin had been acting out. He and Simpson fought, and he had 
  threatened to kill Simpson. He held a knife in a threatening way, while he chased 
  Carrierre to the far end of the range. He and LaKing had a knife-swinging episode. 
  His language was loud and threatening. He started the fire near the barrier. 
  He told [X] to cover the camera lens. He may have had a knife or a shiv on his 
  person. When he went to LaKing's cell, the nearest COs were in the bubble, more 
  than 75 feet away, and, given the mood on the range, none of them were likely 
  to leave the bubble. Martin was drunk, loud and aggressive. He stood near the 
  door of LaKing's cell, and said something which was the same as, or similar 
  to, &quot;You know I don't have a knife. If you want to fight, let's.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent">If Simpson and LaKing believed that, there was no reason for 
  them to fear anything other than a fist-fight. If they didn't believe him, if 
  they thought that he had a knife on him, and said that only to bait them into 
  a fist-fight, during which they might get stabbed, then they had genuine reason 
  to be concerned for their lives.</p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion, self-defence was a live issue.</p>
<p>
  [39] In finding that Simpson was acting in lawful self-defence under s. 34(2) 
  of the Criminal Code when he stabbed Martin, the trial judge said the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> The first ingredient I must consider is this: was Simpson unlawfully 
  assaulted by Martin? &#133; The evidence bearing on that issue is the language 
  Martin used at LaKing's cell door, uttered in the context I have already described, 
  while the three of them were within a few feet of one another. I conclude that 
  Martin's words were an assault within the meaning of s. 265(1)(b).</p>
<p class="indent">Next I must consider whether Simpson caused the death of Martin 
  under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm, and believed, 
  on reasonable and probable grounds, that he could not otherwise protect himself 
  from death or grievous bodily harm.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">I cannot now say, on the basis of the evidence I heard, whether 
  Simpson was in danger of being stabbed. No knife was found on Martin afterward. 
  No witness said that he saw a knife in Martin's hand, or on his person, while 
  he stood in the doorway of LaKing's cell. But given the evidence I heard about 
  Martin, about life in general on the range that day, about the earlier events 
  of the day, and about the circumstances at the cell door, including Martin's 
  statement that he didn't have a knife, it seems to me that a reasonable man 
  would be under a reasonable apprehension of death or critically serious bodily 
  harm. That same reasonable man, standing where Simpson did, could think of retreating 
  - but there was really no place to go. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">If Simpson believed Martin's statement that he didn't have a 
  knife, his only concern would have been the risk of a fist-fight. If, on the 
  other hand, he didn't believe Martin, and decided, rightly or wrongly, that 
  Martin did have a knife, and that the invitation to fight was a ploy to give 
  Martin the upper hand in any subsequent fight, or to excuse Martin stabbing 
  him, or LaKing, or both of them after a fist-fight started, then he was in a 
  difficult and dangerous position. </p>
<p class="indent">I conclude that Simpson caused Martin's death under a reasonable 
  apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm, that Simpson believed, on reasonable 
  and probable grounds, that he could not otherwise preserve himself from death 
  or grievous bodily harm&#133;.</p>
<p>
  IV. Grounds of Appeal</p>
<p>
  [40] As already noted, the Crown raises two main issues on appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> i. did the trial judge err in determining that there was an 
  air of reality to the defence of self-defence; and</p>
<p class="indent">ii. if there was an air of reality to self-defence, did the 
  trial judge err in law in the manner in which he assessed its subjective elements?</p>
<p>
  V. Analysis</p>
<p>
  i) Did the trial judge err in determining that there was an air of reality to 
  the defence of self-defence?</p>
<p>
  [41] The Crown submits that the trial judge erred in law in two respects in 
  determining that there was an air of reality to Simpson's claim of self-defence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [42] First, the trial judge erred in finding that words alone can constitute 
  an assault. On this issue, the Crown submits that there was no evidence of an 
  act or gesture by Martin capable of constituting an assault in the moments leading 
  up to the stabbing. Further, although Simpson relied on the evidence adduced 
  by the Crown of his post-killing utterance to the effect that he was acting 
  in self-defence, and on honest but mistaken belief in an assault as creating 
  an air of reality to the defence, the trial judge made no findings in relation 
  to either of those issues. Rather, in finding that Simpson was acting in lawful 
  self-defence, the trial judge explicitly determined that Martin's words amounted 
  to an assault within the meaning of s. 265(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. This 
  finding amounted to an error in law.</p>
<p>
  [43] I reject the Crown's first submission for two reasons.</p>
<p>
  [44] First, accepting the Crown's position that the trial judge's reasons were 
  predicated on a finding that there was an actual assault, and that, in order 
  to constitute an assault words must be accompanied by an act or gesture, I am 
  not persuaded that the trial judge made any error in finding that &quot;Martin's 
  words [uttered in the context he described] were an assault within the meaning 
  of s. 265(1)(b)&quot; of the Criminal Code. </p>
<p>
  [45] In finding that Simpson was unlawfully assaulted, the trial judge did not 
  rely exclusively on Martin's words; rather he relied on Martin's words and the 
  context in which they were spoken. The trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The evidence bearing on that issue is the language Martin used at LaKing's cell 
  door, uttered in the context I have already described, while the three of them 
  were within a few feet of one another. I conclude that Martin's words were an 
  assault within the meaning of s. 265(1)(b) [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [46] Section 265 (1) (b) of the Criminal Code provides as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A person commits an assault when... he attempts or threatens, by an act or gesture, 
  to apply force to another person, if he has, or causes that other person to 
  believe on reasonable grounds that he has, present ability to effect his purpose.</p>
<p>
  [47] The context that the trial judge had already described included Martin's 
  reputation for violence, his aggressive conduct earlier in the day, his conduct 
  in starting the fire and directing that the camera be covered, and his drunk, 
  loud and aggressive demeanour in the timeframe immediately preceding his death.</p>
<p>
  [48] For the purposes of s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code, it is necessary only 
  that the evidence of an unlawful assault on an accused person meet the standard 
  of being capable, if accepted by a properly instructed trier of fact acting 
  reasonably, of forming the basis for an acquittal. In R. v. P&eacute;tel (1994), 
  87 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada pointed out that, in 
  determining whether an accused person was unlawfully assaulted within the meaning 
  of s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code, the correct focus is not &quot;on trying the 
  victim&quot;, but rather on the accused person's state of mind. Further, &quot;it 
  is the accused (and not the victim) who must be given the benefit of a reasonable 
  doubt&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [49] Considered in the context described by the trial judge, which included 
  Martin's actions in starting the fire, in directing that the camera be covered 
  his threat to kill the &quot;goofs&quot; (i.e. Simpson and LaKing), and in going 
  to LaKing's cell; and Martin's drunk, loud and aggressive demeanour, in my view, 
  the evidence of his words, actions and gestures was sufficient to meet the minimal 
  threshold evidentiary requirement imposed under s. 34(2). </p>
<p>
  [50] Second, when the trial judge delivered his reasons, he did not have the 
  benefit of this court's decision in R. v. Currie (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 190. 
  In Currie, this court makes it clear that, for the purposes of s. 34 (2) of 
  the Criminal Code, it is not necessary to make a finding that there was an actual 
  assault within the meaning of s. 265(1)(b): </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Supreme Court of Canada in Cinous confirmed the principle established in 
  R. v. P&eacute;tel, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 3, 87 C.C.C. (3d) 97, that the existence 
  of an actual assault is not a prerequisite for a defence under s. 34(2). The 
  question that the jury must ask itself is not whether the accused was unlawfully 
  attacked, but whether he reasonably believed in the circumstances that he was 
  being unlawfully attacked.</p>
<p>
  [51] Further, in R. v. Cinous (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at 173, the Supreme 
  Court of Canada held that the same factors that are relevant to the issue of 
  whether the accused was assaulted are also relevant to whether he or she had 
  a reasonable apprehension of bodily harm.</p>
<p>
  [52] In my view, read fairly and as a whole, including the portions dealing 
  with a reasonable apprehension of bodily harm, the trial judge's reasons demonstrate 
  a clear finding that Simpson &quot;reasonably believed he was about to be attacked 
  and that his belief was reasonable in the circumstances&quot;. Viewed in that 
  light, the trial judge's conclusion amounted to a finding that &quot;Martin's 
  words [uttered in the context the trial judge described] were an assault within 
  the meaning of s. s. 34(2)&quot; of the Criminal Code and reveal no error. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p> [53] The Crown's second submission relating to its first ground of appeal 
  is that the trial judge erred in finding an evidentiary basis for self-defence. 
  The Crown points out that there are three constituent elements of self-defence 
  under s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> and 
  that all three elements require the trier of fact to determine both how the 
  accused perceived the relevant facts and whether his perception was reasonable 
  in the circumstances. Given that Simpson did not testify, and that there was 
  no other evidence concerning his subjective frame of mind, there was no basis 
  for the trial judge to determine how Simpson perceived the situation he faced, 
  and therefore no air of reality to his claim of self-defence.</p>
<p> [54] I reject the Crown's submissions. While it may be difficult if not impossible 
  in some circumstances to assess an accused person's state of mind in the absence 
  of direct evidence from the accused, where circumstantial evidence is available, 
  it is open to a trier of fact to draw inferences concerning an accused person's 
  mental state based on that evidence: see R. v. Mitchell (1965), 1 C.C.C. 155 
  (S.C.C.) and R. v. Cinous at para. 89. For reasons that I will explain below, 
  in my view, there was circumstantial evidence in this case to support Simpson's 
  claim of self-defence.</p>
<p> ii) Did the trial judge err in law in the manner in which he assessed the 
  subjective elements of self-defence?</p>
<p> [55] Assuming there was an air of reality to Simpson's claim of self-defence, 
  the Crown submits that the trial judge erred in law in assessing its subjective 
  components. In particular, as already noted, the Crown contends that each of 
  the three constituent elements of self-defence contains a subjective and an 
  objective component, requiring the trier of fact to determine first how the 
  accused perceived the relevant facts and then to determine whether the accused's 
  perception was reasonable in the circumstances<a href="#a">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a>. 
  The Crown submits that in this case the trial judge did the opposite; he began 
  by determining what a reasonable man would have perceived and then concluded 
  that is what Simpson must have perceived in the circumstances. In doing so, 
  the trial judge adopted an incorrect approach and effectively eliminated the 
  subjective elements of the defence. </p>
<p> [56] [56] The Crown relies on the following portions of the trial judge's 
  reasons to demonstrate his error. </p>
<p>
  [57] First, in determining there was an air of reality to self-defence, the 
  trial judge considered only the objective element of the test when he found 
  that if the respondents believed that Martin had a knife they had a genuine 
  reason to be concerned for their lives. The Crown submits that the trial judge 
  failed to consider whether there was sufficient evidence to establish that Simpson 
  actually believed that Martin had a knife: </p>
<p class="indent"> The first issue to be determined is whether self-defence was 
  a live issue in this case. </p>
<p class="indent">There is some evidence bearing on that issue .&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Martin stood near the door of LaKing's cell, and said something 
  which was the same as, or similar to, &quot;You know I don't have a knife. If 
  you want to fight, let's.&quot;</p>
<p class="indent">If Simpson and LaKing believed that, there was no reason for 
  them to fear anything other than a fist-fight. If they didn't believe him if 
  they thought that he had a knife on him, and said that only to bait them into 
  a fist-fight, during which they might be stabbed, then they had genuine reason 
  to be concerned for their lives. </p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion, self-defence was a live issue.</p>
<p>
  [58] Second, in determining that Simpson was under a reasonable apprehension 
  of death or serious bodily harm, the trial judge looked only at what the reasonable 
  man in his position would have thought rather than considering what Simpson 
  actually thought: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I cannot now say, on the basis of the evidence I heard, whether Simpson was 
  in danger of being stabbed. No knife was found on Martin afterward. No witness 
  said that he saw a knife in Martin's hand, or on his person, while he stood 
  in the doorway of LaKing's cell. But given the evidence I heard about Martin, 
  about life in general on the range that day, about the earlier events of the 
  day, and about the circumstances at the cell door, including Martin's statement 
  that he didn't have a knife, it seems to me that a reasonable man would be under 
  a reasonable apprehension of death or critically serious bodily harm [emphasis 
  added]. &#133;</p>
<p>
  [59] Finally, the trial judge concluded that Simpson believed that Martin had 
  a knife simply on the basis that it would have been reasonable to do so: </p>
<p class="indent"> If Simpson believed Martin's statement that he didn't have 
  a knife, his only concern would have been the risk of a fist-fight. If, on the 
  other hand, he didn't believe Martin and decided, rightly or wrongly, that Martin 
  did have a knife, and that the invitation to fight was a ploy to give Martin 
  the upper hand in any subsequent fight, or to excuse Martin stabbing him, or 
  LaKing, or both of them, after a fist-fight started, then he was in a difficult 
  and dangerous position. </p>
<p class="indent">I conclude that Simpson caused Martin's death under a reasonable 
  apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm, that Simpson believed, on reasonable 
  and probable grounds, that he could not otherwise preserve himself from death 
  or grievous bodily harm&#133; .</p>
<p>
  [60] I reject the Crown's submissions for three reasons.</p>
<p>
  [61] First, the authorities relied on by the Crown do nothing to rebut the common 
  sense proposition that, where an accused person's mental state is evidenced 
  in whole or in part by circumstantial evidence, an analysis of what a reasonable 
  person would conclude in the particular circumstances is a relevant factor in 
  assessing an accused person's state of mind. The important point is that the 
  various elements of self-defence under s. 34(2) have both an objective and a 
  subjective component. It is not an error in law to take account of one's conclusions 
  on the objective elements in determining the subjective components: see R. v. 
  Baxter (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p> [62] Second, in my view, the trial judge's findings are, in large measure, 
  a response to the live issues that were presented to him for determination. 
  In making his findings, the trial judge effectively rejected the Crown's submission 
  at trial that the proper inference to be drawn from the evidence was that, on 
  January 26, 1999, the atmosphere on the range was not unusual and that when 
  Martin started the fire he had turned his attention to the guards. Rather, the 
  trial judge found that, on that particular day, Simpson found himself locked 
  on the range with an intoxicated bully, who had threatened his life and who 
  was capable of unpredictable violence. When Martin started the fire, directed 
  that the camera be covered and approached LaKing's cell, there was every reason 
  to believe that he was armed and ready for a fight and that Simpson had no realistic 
  hope of rescue from the guards.</p>
<p>
  [63] Having rejected the Crown's position concerning the atmosphere on the range 
  and concluded that a reasonable man would fear for his life in the same circumstances, 
  it was open to the trial judge to draw the inference that Simpson feared for 
  his life. Moreover, in light of the trial judge's findings concerning the atmosphere 
  on the range, there was sufficient evidence to support his conclusions concerning 
  the issue of self-defence. </p>
<p>
  [64] Third, although the trial judge spoke in objective terms at various places 
  in his reasons, he also made it clear with respect to each element of self-defence 
  that the focus of his inquiry and his ultimate conclusion related to Simpson's 
  actual mental state: see, for example, the last paragraph of the quotation at 
  paragraph [39] above. </p>
<p>
  [65] I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  VI. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [66] For the reasons given, I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
