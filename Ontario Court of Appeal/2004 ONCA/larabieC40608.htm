<p>BLAIR J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Les Fr&egrave;res des &eacute;coles chr&eacute;tiennes d'Ottawa (&quot;Les 
  Fr&egrave;res&quot;) and The Roman Catholic Episcoal Corporation of Ottawa (&quot;the 
  Church&quot;) each move (i) for an order staying this action because of the 
  non-payment of cost orders made against the appellant, and (ii) for an order 
  for security for costs respecting the within appeal. The background giving rise 
  to these motions, briefly stated, is as follows.</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [2] In 1996 Mr. Larabie commenced a different action claiming damages for sexual 
  and physical assaults he alleges he suffered while a resident at St. Joseph's 
  Training School for four years during the early 1950's (&quot;the first action&quot;). 
  The allegations in this action are essentially the same, except that in the 
  first action two different individuals were named as defendants. </p>
<p>
  [3] Subsequent to the commencement of the first action, Mr. Larabie learned 
  that he had named the wrong individuals as defendants and he moved to add John-Paul 
  Montfils (&quot;Brother Irenee&quot;) and John Doe aka Brother Anselme (&quot;Brother 
  Anselme&quot;) as defendants. At the same time, the defendants moved for an 
  order dismissing the action as against the originally named individual defendants. 
  On October 2, 1998, Manton J. dismissed Mr. Larabie's motion and granted the 
  motion dismissing the action against the two individuals, with costs against 
  the plaintiff in favour of the two individuals on a solicitor-client basis to 
  be assessed.</p>
<p>
  [4] Mr. Larabie did not appeal Justice Manton's order. </p>
<p>
  [5] At the beginning of the year 2000, Mr. Larabie moved to amend his statement 
  of claim to add allegations against Brothers Irenee and Anselme, and again to 
  name them as defendants. Master Beaudoin dismissed this motion on the basis 
  that it was virtually identical to the motion brought before Manton J., which 
  had not been appealed, and the issues were therefore res judicata. Costs were 
  awarded against the plaintiff in the amount of $3,495.26 payable forthwith.</p>
<p>
  [6] Mr. Larabie appealed Master Beaudoin's order to Panet J., who dismissed 
  the appeal on the basis of deference to the Master's exercise of discretion, 
  with costs against the plaintiff fixed at $3500 payable forthwith. M&eacute;tivier 
  J. rejected Mr. Larabie's request for leave to appeal to the Divisional Court, 
  on the ground that there was no issue of public importance. Costs were again 
  awarded against the plaintiff in the amount of $4000, payable forthwith. </p>
<p>
  [7] Next, Mr. Larabie attempted to appeal directly to this court from the Master's 
  order, arguing that it should be treated as a final, rather than an interlocutory, 
  order. Once more, he was unsuccessful - on the basis that this court lacked 
  jurisdiction to hear the appeal - and costs were awarded against him, to be 
  assessed.</p>
<p>
  [8] Thereafter, on May 25, 2002, Justice Roy granted summary judgment dismissing 
  the action against Les Fr&egrave;res on the basis that their liability for breach 
  of fiduciary duty depended upon the allegations made against the individuals 
  who had been named as defendants but against whom the action was now dismissed 
  as a result of the order of Manton J. No other individual defendants were named, 
  since Mr. Larabie had failed in his attempts to amend his statement of claim 
  to that effect. Again, costs were awarded against the plaintiff, fixed at $6500. 
  Later, the action against the Church was disposed of as well.</p>
<p>
  [9] Following this series of setbacks Mr. Larabie decided to start over again. 
  In October 2002, he commenced the present action. His claims are similar to 
  the claims made in the first action, but this time he has named Brother Irenee 
  and Brother Anselme as defendants, along with the corporate and institutional 
  defendants. Les Fr&egrave;res moved to strike the statement of claim. On August 
  22, 2003, Forget J. did so, on the ground that the new action constituted an 
  abuse of process. He awarded costs to Les Fr&egrave;res in the amount of $7,500 
  and to the Church in the amount of $2500.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appeal presently pending before this court is from the order of Justice 
  Forget.</p>
<p>
  [11] Mr. Larabie has paid none of the outstanding costs awards. By my arithmetic 
  they total $27,495.26. </p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [12] The rules that pertain to these motions are the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> 56.01 (1) The court, on motion by the defendant or respondent 
  in a proceeding, may make such order for security for costs as is just where 
  it appears that,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the plaintiff or applicant is ordinarily resident outside 
  Ontario;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the defendant or respondent has an order against the plaintiff 
  or applicant for costs in the same or another proceeding that remain unpaid 
  in whole or in part;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) there is good reason to believe that the action or application 
  is frivolous and vexatious and that the plaintiff or applicant has insufficient 
  assets in Ontario to pay the costs of the defendant or respondent.</p>
<p class="indent">60.12 Where a party fails to comply with an interlocutory order, 
  the court may, in addition to any other sanction provided by these rules,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) stay the party's proceeding;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) dismiss the party's proceeding or strike out the party's 
  defence; or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) make such other order as is just.</p>
<p class="indent">61.06 (1) In an appeal where it appears that,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) there is good reason to believe that the appeal is frivolous 
  and vexatious and that the appellant has insufficient assets in Ontario to pay 
  the costs of the appeal;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) an order for security for costs could be made against the 
  appellant under rule 56.01; or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) for other good reason, security for costs should be ordered,</p>
<p class="indent">a judge of the appellate court, on motion by the respondent, 
  may make such order for security for costs of the proceedings and of the appeal 
  as is just.</p>
<p>[13] Here, there is no doubt that Mr. Larabie has not paid numerous outstanding 
  orders for costs against him, in significant amounts; that he is a non-resident 
  of Ontario; and that his has insufficient assets in Ontario to pay those costs 
  or the costs of the pending appeal. There is ample basis upon which the court 
  could exercise its discretion both to stay the action and to order security 
  for costs on the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [14] Mr. Larabie has caused the defendants to respond to the various proceedings 
  outlined above, in all of which he has been unsuccessful, and has refused to 
  pay any of the outstanding costs orders against him. Now he has commenced a 
  new action, making the very same allegations as those in the proceeding in which 
  the courts have already ruled against him. That action has been dismissed, with 
  costs (also unpaid) and Mr. Larabie has appealed to the Court of Appeal. The 
  moving parties submit that the court should exercise its discretion under the 
  foregoing rules and stay the action until Mr. Larabie has paid the outstanding 
  costs and, further, order that he provide security for costs of the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [15] Although the decision is not an easy one, I am not prepared to do so, for 
  the following reasons.</p>
<p>
  [16] I am satisfied on the record that Mr. Larabie is an impecunious plaintiff. 
  His income is limited to approximately $840 per month in the form of a disability 
  pension from the Federal Government and he becomes eligible for the old age 
  pension this month. He has no assets save for basic clothing and a few personal 
  belongings. He simply has no means of satisfying the outstanding costs orders 
  or of posting any meaningful amount as security for costs. To accede to the 
  moving parties' requests would end the proceedings for all practical purposes 
  and, in effect, bar him from the judicial process without him having had a final 
  chance to persuade the court that he should be permitted to have his claims 
  adjudicated on the merits.</p>
<p>
  [17] There is ample authority for the proposition that the courts are reluctant 
  to deprive a worthy but impecunious litigant of the opportunity to have his 
  or her claim adjudicated when it is not plainly devoid of merit: see, for example, 
  Rackley v. Rice (1992), 8 O.R. (3d) 105 (Ont. Div. Ct.); John Wink Ltd. v. Sico 
  Inco(1987), 57 O.R. (2d) 705 (Ont. H.C.); Solcan Electric Corp. v. Viewstar 
  Canada Inc. (1994), 25 C.P.C. (3d) 181 (Ont. Gen. Div.); 1056470 Ontario Inc. 
  v. Choo-Eng Goh (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 92. Although these are lower court decisions 
  the same principle should apply in appeals in this court, in my view.</p>
<p>
  [18] The problem here is that Mr. Larabie has never had the opportunity to have 
  his case considered on the merits. In hindsight, of course, it might have been 
  better if the original order of Manton J. had been appealed. When that was not 
  done the substance of his claim were overshadowed by procedural questions as 
  to whether or not the matter had become res judicata and thereafter whether 
  the various requisites for appeal or leave to appeal had been met.</p>
<p>
  [19] There does seem to be at least some foundation for Mr. Larabie's claim 
  on the merits, however. A medical report from a psychiatrist, Dr. Wayne Quan, 
  records that he does not have &quot;any doubts that Mr. Larabie is contending 
  with chronic depression and an ongoing post-traumatic stress disorder as a result 
  of abuse received a great number of years ago&quot;. An affidavit from a former 
  fellow-student at St. Joseph's attests to at least one incident of abuse.</p>
<p>
  [20] Justice Forget made a difficult decision in the exercise of his discretion 
  in dismissing the second action. He did so on the basis that it constituted 
  an abuse of process, primarily on the basis that it was an attempt to re-litigate 
  something that had already been decided. He acknowledged, however, that &quot;la 
  question soulev&eacute;e par la motion est &eacute;pineuse&quot;, and I am not 
  able to conclude there is good reason to believe that Mr. Larabie's appeal is 
  frivolous and vexatious. Indeed, Mr. Caza stated he is not taking the position 
  the appeal falls into that category, although Mr. Wallis did. It will be for 
  this court to consider on the appeal whether Mr. Larabie's new action is an 
  abuse of process on the basis of res judicata or some other ground.</p>
<p>
  [21] I am not unmindful of the moving parties' arguments outlined above, nor 
  am I unsympathetic towards the position in which they find themselves. Litigants 
  are not free to ignore or flout orders of the court awarding costs against them 
  or to re-litigate matters that have truly been litigated and decided before. 
  Having considered all of the circumstances, however, and having weighed and 
  balanced the various competing interests and factors in relation to this matter, 
  I conclude that I should exercise my discretion in favour of permitting Mr. 
  Larabie to proceed with the appeal, and to do so without having to post security 
  for costs. I expect that he will do so in a reasonably expeditious fashion.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [22] Accordingly, both motions are dismissed. Costs are reserved to the panel 
  hearing the appeal.</p>
