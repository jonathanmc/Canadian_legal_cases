<p>On appeal from a committal order of Justice H.E. Sachs of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated October 4, 2002 and an application for judicial review of an 
  order of surrender of the Minister of Justice dated March 17, 2003.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellants are sought for extradition to the United States to face charges 
  of conspiracy to traffic cocaine and conspiracy to possess cocaine for the purpose 
  of trafficking. The American authorities allege that both appellants were parties 
  to a scheme to transport large quantities of cocaine from the United States 
  to the United Kingdom. It is alleged that an American Airlines flight attendant 
  transported regular shipments of cocaine from New York to London from 1992 to 
  1999 and that the appellants coordinated the shipments from Canada. </p>
<p>
  [2] At the extradition hearing, the appellants made no submissions with respect 
  to the sufficiency of the evidence, but rather challenged the constitutionality 
  of ss. 32 and 33 of the Extradition Act, S.C. 1999, c.18 ("Act"). 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] Sections 32 and 33, introduced as part of the new Act that came into force 
  in 1999, eliminate the need for first-hand sworn evidence and permit the requesting 
  state to proceed on the basis of an unsworn record of the case. The foreign 
  prosecutor or judge is required only to provide a summary of the evidence and 
  to certify that the evidence is available for the purposes of prosecution in 
  the requesting state. </p>
<p class="indent"> 32.(1) Subject to subsection (2), evidence that would otherwise 
  be admissible under Canadian law shall be admitted as evidence at an extradition 
  hearing. The following shall also be admitted as evidence, even if it would 
  not otherwise be admissible under Canadian law: </p>
<p class="indent10"> (a) the contents of the documents contained in the record 
  of the case certified under subsection 33(3);</p>
<p class="indent10">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent10">(c) evidence adduced by the person sought for extradition 
  that is relevant to the tests set out in subsection 29(1) if the judge considers 
  it reliable.</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) Evidence gathered in Canada must satisfy the rules of evidence 
  under Canadian law in order to be admitted.</p>
<p class="indent">33.(1) The record of the case must include</p>
<p class="indent">(a) in the case of a person sought for the purpose of prosecution, 
  a document summarizing the evidence available to the extradition partner for 
  use in the prosecution;</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A record of the case may include other relevant documents, 
  including documents respecting the identification of the person sought for extradition.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) A record of the case may not be admitted unless</p>
<p class="indent">(a) in the case of a person sought for the purpose of prosecution, 
  a judicial or prosecuting authority of the extradition partner certifies that 
  the evidence summarized or contained in the record of the case is available 
  for trial and</p>
<p class="indent">(i) is sufficient under the law of the extradition partner to 
  justify prosecution,</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) was gathered according to the law of the extradition partner. 
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(4) No authentication of documents is required unless a relevant 
  extradition agreement provides otherwise.</p>
<p class="indent">(5) For the purposes of this section, a record of the case includes 
  any supplement added to it.</p>
<p>[4] The extradition judge dismissed the constitutional challenge on the ground 
  that she was bound by the decision of this court in United States of America 
  v. Yang (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 52. The appellants appeal to this court, but they 
  did not ask for a five-judge panel to reconsider Yang. They argue that that 
  ss. 32 and 33 violate s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms because 
  </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. ss. 32(1)(a) and 33 permit the requesting state to proceed 
  on the basis of an unsworn record of the case, and</p>
<p class="indent">2. s. 32(1)(c) imposes a "reliability" requirement on evidence 
  adduced by the party sought for extradition.</p>
<p>
  [5] Following their committal for extradition, the appellants made written submissions 
  to the Minister of Justice, requesting him to refuse to order their surrender 
  on the following grounds: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. That the conduct in respect of which the request for extradition 
  is sought is properly within the jurisdiction of Canada to prosecute and extradition 
  should be refused;</p>
<p class="indent">2. That extradition would be unjust and oppressive on the ground 
  that </p>
<p class="indent10">(a) the evidence against the appellants will be comprised of 
  the allegations of a co-conspirator and wire tap evidence which would likely 
  not be admissible in Canada;</p>
<p class="indent10">(b) if convicted, the appellants will likely face the penalty 
  of life imprisonment;</p>
<p class="indent">3. In the alternative, if the Minister does order their surrender, 
  he should ask for assurances that the appellants will be given "two for one" 
  credit for pre-trial custody in Canada. </p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant Latty is a Canadian citizen and argued that the Minister's 
  decision to surrender him violates his s. 6(1) Charter right to remain in Canada. 
  He also relied on s. 44(1)(a) of the Act requiring the Minister to refuse a 
  surrender order if satisfied that such an order would be unjust or oppressive 
  having regard to all the relevant circumstances. The appellant Wright is a landed 
  immigrant and therefore unable to assert a s. 6(1) Charter claim, but he too 
  relies upon s. 44(1)(a) of the Act. Both appellants also relied upon ss. 7 and 
  12 of the Charter in their submissions to the Minister. </p>
<p>
  [7] The Minister refused the appellants' requests and the appellants seek judicial 
  review of the Minister's decision. (For ease of reference, we refer to them 
  as "appellants" throughout, although for purposes of the judicial 
  review application they are "applicants" before this court.)</p>
<p>
  [8] This appeal and application for judicial review was heard during the same 
  week and by the same panel that heard the appeal in United States of America 
  v. Ferras and the decisions in both cases are being released at the same time. 
  </p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  1. Do ss. 32 and 33 violate s. 7 of the Charter because </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) ss. 32(1)(a) and 33 permit the requesting state to proceed 
  on the basis of an unsworn record of the case, and </p>
<p class="indent">(b) s. 32(1)(c) imposes a "reliability" requirement on evidence 
  adduced by the party sought for extradition?</p>
<p>
  [9] The decision of this court in Yang is dispositive of both issues. We do 
  not agree with the appellants that the statement in Yang at para. 54 - that 
  finding ss. 32 and 33 valid "does not preclude an argument that the application 
  of the provisions may, in a particular case, operate to violate the fugitive's 
  rights" - requires the extradition judge to assess the reliability of the 
  evidence. Rather, we read this passage as indicating that the extradition judge 
  is entitled to consider the evidence with a view to determining whether the 
  Charter rights of the person sought for extradition have been otherwise violated.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellants raised the s. 32(1)(c) point before the extradition judge, 
  but they did not seek to introduce evidence and accordingly, there is no factual 
  basis to support their assertion that the reliability requirement violates their 
  s. 7 rights. Moreover, for the reasons given in Ferras, we do not accept the 
  submission advanced by the appellants on this point.</p>
<p>
  2. Should this court grant judicial review of the Minister's decision to order 
  the appellants' surrender? </p>
<p>
  [11] We are not persuaded by the argument that we should grant judicial review 
  of the Minister's decision to surrender the appellants on any of the grounds 
  advanced. </p>
<p>
  (a) Validity of ss. 32 and 33</p>
<p>
  [12] To the extent the appellants rely on the argument that ss. 32 and 33 of 
  the Act violate s. 7 of the Charter, we need not repeat what we have already 
  stated above dismissing that contention. </p>
<p>
  (b) Offence could be prosecuted in Canada</p>
<p>
  [13] With respect to the argument that surrender should be refused on the grounds 
  that the appellants could be prosecuted in Canada, the Minister concluded as 
  follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> I have considered this ground in light of the terms of article 
  17 of the Treaty and section 6(1) of the Charter. In order to determine whether 
  prosecution would be "equally effective in Canada, given the existing domestic 
  laws and international co-operative arrangements" or indeed, whether prosecution 
  in Canada would even be "a realistic option," as described by the Supreme Court 
  of Canada in United States v. Cotroni (1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.), this 
  matter was referred to the competent prosecutorial authority for assessment. 
  Counsel for the Attorney General of Canada concluded that prosecution of each 
  of these two persons in Canada, either separately or jointly, would not be equally 
  effective to extradition and was not a realistic option.</p>
<p class="indent">I note that the cocaine was assembled and distributed through 
  the United States for onward delivery to the United Kingdom using employees 
  of an American airline. American investigators played the major role in developing 
  the case and most of the witnesses are in the United States. There are no charges 
  in Canada and as indicated above none are contemplated. I would not give effect 
  to your submissions on this point.</p>
<p>
  [14] We see no reason to interfere with that determination. It is entirely consistent 
  with Cotroni, supra at p. 225. The allegations involve a sophisticated international 
  drug conspiracy involving several parties who are being prosecuted in the United 
  States. The impact of the offence was most clearly felt in the United States 
  and the United Kingdom, the investigation was primarily that of the American 
  authorities, and most of the acts in furtherance of the conspiracy were committed 
  in the United States. Criminal proceedings have already been commenced in the 
  United States. </p>
<p>
  (c) Possibility of life imprisonment</p>
<p>
  [15] The appellants submitted expert evidence to the effect that if convicted, 
  they could well face life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. While 
  Canadian law does provide for a maximum of life imprisonment for similar offences, 
  it is highly unlikely that the appellants would face a life sentence if prosecuted 
  in Canada. However, we do not accept the contention that the prospect of a more 
  severe sentence in the United States than would be imposed in Canada brings 
  this case within the ambit of United States v. Burns, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 283 where 
  the Supreme Court held at p. 129 that "a particular treatment or punishment 
  may sufficiently violate our sense of fundamental justice as to tilt the balance 
  against extradition. Examples might include stoning to death individuals taken 
  in adultery, or lopping off the hands of a thief. The punishment is so extreme 
  that it becomes the controlling issue in the extradition and overwhelms the 
  rest of the analysis." In Burns, the Supreme Court of Canada held that 
  extradition to face the death penalty would violate s. 7 of the Charter. The 
  imposition of the maximum penalty that could be imposed for the same offence 
  if committed in Canada simply does not fall into the same category as the death 
  penalty, stoning or lopping off hands. Even if, in practice, such a sentence 
  would rarely be imposed in this country, it is available under our law and it 
  does not "sufficiently violate our sense of fundamental justice" to 
  amount to a Charter violation. </p>
<p>
  (d) Credit for pre-trial custody</p>
<p>
  [16] Finally, we do not agree that the Minister's decision not to seek the assurance 
  of the American authorities that the appellants receive a two for one credit 
  for time served in pre-trial custody violates the appellants' rights under ss. 
  6, 7 or 12 of the Charter. While credit along these lines has become common 
  in Canada, as the Minister observed in his decision rejecting this argument, 
  there is a different regime in place in the United States to determine the appropriate 
  credit for pre-trial custody administered by the federal prison authorities. 
  As decided by this court in Adam v. United States of America (2003), 64 O.R. 
  (3d) 268, refusal to attach the condition requested does not violate the appellants' 
  Charter rights. </p>
<p>
  Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [17] For these reasons, we dismiss the appeal and the application for judicial 
  review.</p>
