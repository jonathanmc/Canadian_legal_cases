<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant is a commercial landlord. It entered into a lease of office 
  premises with the respondent tenant dated March 22, 2000. The lease includes 
  the following provisions: </p>
<p class="indent"> 3.01 THE LANDLORD COVENANTS WITH THE TENANT DURING THE TERM: 
  The rental set out above is a Gross Rent and is inclusive of Base Rent, all 
  Taxes, Maintenance, Insurance, Utilities and other costs and no other amounts 
  shall be payable save for G.S.T. and similar Taxes. The Landlord shall operate 
  and maintain the Building on a first class manner throughout the Term.</p>
<p class="indent">4.00 THE TENANT COVENANTS WITH THE LANDLORD DURING THE TERM: 
  To pay Hydro directly to the Utility company.</p>
<p>
  [2] On January 24, 2002, the tenant applied for an order determining whether 
  it was entitled to deduct from the "Gross Rent" payable to the landlord 
  the amount that it was required to pay for "Hydro directly to the Utility 
  company". At the outset of the application, the parties agreed that the 
  lease should be interpreted without reference to conversations and documents 
  that were entered into before the lease was made.</p>
<p>
  [3] The application judge held that the tenant is entitled to deduct from Gross 
  Rent the amounts it is required to pay directly to the utility company for hydro. 
  The sole issue on this appeal is the proper interpretation of clauses 3.01 and 
  4.00 of the subject lease.</p>
<p>
  [4] In our view, the application judge erred, for three reasons, in holding 
  that the tenant is entitled to deduct amounts paid directly to the utility company 
  for hydro.</p>
<p>
  [5] First, although it may appear on a first reading that clauses 3.01 and 4.00 
  of the lease are inconsistent, the inconsistency is resolved by recognizing 
  that clause 4.00 is a specific provision that qualifies the more general provision 
  contained in clause 3.01. In B.G. Checo International Ltd. v. British Columbia 
  Hydro and Power Authority, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12, the Supreme Court of Canada said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is a cardinal rule of the construction of contracts that the various parts 
  of the contract are to be interpreted in the context of the intentions of the 
  parties as evident from the contract as a whole: K. Lewison. The Interpretation 
  of Contracts (1989), at p. 124; Chitty on Contracts (26th ed. 1989), vol. 1, 
  at p. 520. Where there are apparent inconsistencies between different terms 
  of a contract, the court should attempt to find an interpretation which can 
  reasonably give meaning to each of the terms in question. Only if an interpretation 
  giving reasonable consistency to the terms in question cannot be found will 
  the court rule one clause or the other ineffective: Chitty on Contracts, supra, 
  at p. 526; [additional citations omitted]. In this process, the terms will, 
  if reasonably possible, be reconciled by construing one term as a qualification 
  of the other term: Forbes v. Git, [1922] 1 A.C. 256; Cotter v. General Petroleums 
  Ltd., [1951] S.C.R. 154. A frequent result of this kind of analysis will be 
  that general terms of a contract will be seen to be qualified by specific terms 
  - or, to put it another way, where there is apparent conflict between a general 
  term and a specific term, the terms may be reconciled by taking the parties 
  to have intended the scope of the general term to not extend to the subject-matter 
  of the specific term.</p>
<p>
  [6] The principle set out in B.G. Checo International Ltd. is applicable here. 
  Clause 3.01 provides that the Gross Rent payable to the landlord includes Base 
  Rent as well as a list of expenses associated with the operation of the Building, 
  namely, "all Taxes, Maintenance, Insurance, Utilities, and other costs". 
  Clause 3.01 also provides that no other amount shall be payable and requires 
  that the Landlord operate the Building in a first class manner. However, clause 
  4.00 is a more specific provision. It identifies a particular category of utilities, 
  and specifies that the tenant should pay that expense directly, rather than 
  treating it as an expense that is paid by the landlord and passed on to the 
  tenant as part of Gross Rent. By interpreting clauses 3.01 and 4.00 in this 
  way, it can be seen that clause 3.01 is a general provision dealing with expenses 
  that are payable by the landlord, while clause 4.00 addresses a specific expense 
  payable by the tenant directly. Moreover, the word "directly" has 
  a distinct meaning and the apparent inconsistency between clauses 3.01 and 4.00 
  is resolved.</p>
<p>
  [7] Second, the lease does not contain any specific language authorizing the 
  tenant to deduct amounts paid directly to the utility company for hydro. It 
  would be necessary to read in or imply such language in order to adopt the interpretation 
  suggested by the tenant.</p>
<p>
  [8] Third, the interpretation of clause 4.00 that we have adopted is consistent 
  with the interpretation adopted by the parties in relation to the insurance 
  provisions of the lease. Like Utilities, Insurance is one of the expenses that 
  clause 3.01 lists as being included in Gross Rent. The tenant takes no issue 
  with the fact that clause 34.00 of the lease requires it to take out and pay 
  for comprehensive general liability insurance for the leased premises. </p>
<p>
  [9] While it is true that clause 34.00 of the lease is more detailed than clause 
  4.00, in that it specifies that the tenant must "take out and keep in force" 
  the necessary insurance, that does not change the fact that, like clauses 4.00 
  and 3.01, there is an apparent inconsistency between clause 34.00 and clause 
  3.01. The trial judge discounted the significance of the tenant's position concerning 
  clause 34.00 to the interpretation of clause 4.00 by finding that it would be 
  highly unusual for a landlord to pay the tenant's insurance. However, in the 
  absence of evidence on the application, it was not open to her to conclude that 
  the hydro charges under consideration should be handled in a different way than 
  tenant's insurance. </p>
<p>
  [10] For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the application judge's interpretation 
  of the lease is not correct. Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, set aside 
  the judgment of the application judge and substitute an order dismissing the 
  tenant's application. We decline to make a declaratory order setting our conclusions 
  concerning the interpretation of the lease as there was no cross-application 
  before the court below. However, it flows from this decision that the tenant 
  should pay to the landlord any amounts it has deducted from Gross Rent on account 
  of hydro paid directly to the utility company.</p>
<p>
  [11] The appellant is entitled to costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity 
  basis fixed at $7,000 inclusive of disbursements and applicable G.S.T. and to 
  costs of the application fixed at $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and applicable 
  G.S.T. </p>
