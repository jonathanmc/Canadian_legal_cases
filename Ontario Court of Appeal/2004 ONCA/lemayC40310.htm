<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of various driving related offences and breach 
  of probation. She was sentenced to a total of 23 months in jail, after credit 
  for 104 days of pre?trial custody, to be followed by 2 years probation. She 
  was also ordered to make restitution in the sum of $7,781.29. She appeals her 
  sentence and the restitution order.</p>
<p>[2] The appellant argues that the custodial part of her sentence was unduly 
  harsh. We disagree.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant has a horrendous record for drinking and driving offences 
  and a history of breaching probation orders. She has more than 10 prior convictions 
  for drinking and driving offences and was twice ordered not to operate a motor 
  vehicle for the remainder of her life. The offences in this case were committed 
  by the appellant shortly after she was released from jail following a conviction 
  for impaired driving, amongst convictions for other offences.</p>
<p>[4] The evidence concerning the nature of the appellant's driving on this occasion, 
  her consequent endangerment of others, and her record for drinking and driving 
  offences amply support the custodial sentence. If anything, in our view, the 
  23 months custodial part of her sentence was lenient in the circumstances; however, 
  there is no Crown cross-appeal in this case.</p>
<p>[5] The appellant also argues that the restitution order was improper in the 
  circumstances because the trial judge did not take into account her ability 
  to make restitution. The ability to pay is a relevant, although not a controlling, 
  factor to be considered before imposing a restitution order. In this case, no 
  consideration was given by the trial judge to the appellant's ability to pay; 
  nor is the basis for the restitution order clear on the record before us. </p>
<p>[6] Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the sentence appeal 
  is allowed, in part, by deleting the restitution order. All other aspects of 
  the sentence remain in place.</p>
