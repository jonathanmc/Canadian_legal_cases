<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant received a total sentence of fifty-four months (in addition 
  to ten months calculated on a two-for-one basis for time spent in pre-trial 
  custody) for a series of offences including various driving offences, failing 
  to appear, false pretences and most significantly, kidnapping, robbery and extortion 
  in relation to an 84 year-old woman.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant challenges the total sentence. He submits that the trial judge 
  erred in the manner in which he calculated the amount of time spent by the appellant 
  in pre-trial custody for which he was entitled to credit. That ground has, at 
  its root, the application of this court's decision in R. v. Atkinson (2003), 
  174 C.C.C. (3d) 144, which, on the facts of this case, resulted in the appellant 
  serving approximately thirteen and a half months of a conditional sentence in 
  custody following his arrest and detention for having allegedly breached the 
  terms of his conditional sentence order. That arrest and detention came several 
  days after his arrest and detention on the substantive charges that form the 
  subject of this appeal. The oddity of this case is that during the thirteen 
  and a half month time frame, no breach hearing was held. Indeed, no such hearing 
  has ever been held. </p>
<p>
  [3] Based on Atkinson, the trial judge, with the approval of the defence counsel 
  [not Ms. Egan], refused to consider the thirteen and a half month period as 
  pre-trial custody that could be taken to account on the substantive charges. 
  Rather, he treated it as time during which the appellant was serving out the 
  remainder of his conditional sentence. </p>
<p>
  [4] On appeal, the appellant takes exception to that approach. He submits that 
  the principles of Atkinson should not apply in the circumstances and that he 
  should be credited on the substantive offences for an additional thirteen and 
  a half months of pre-trial custody. Calculated on a two-for-one basis, that 
  would amount to slightly more than two years' additional credit.</p>
<p>
  [5] For reasons that follow, we need not finally decide whether the principles 
  in Atkinson should be ameliorated in the interests of fairness when through 
  no fault of an accused, the breach hearing is not pursued with diligence and 
  completed in a timely fashion. No such fairness issues arise here. The breach 
  hearing was delayed at the instance of the appellant. Had it proceeded, we have 
  no doubt that the breach would have been established. As well, given the horrendous 
  nature of the crimes underlying the breach and the appellant's lengthy and serious 
  criminal record, we are certain that the balance of the conditional sentence 
  would have been converted into a custodial sentence. </p>
<p>
  [6] Viewed that way, the manner in which the conditional sentence was treated 
  for purposes of calculating the amount of pre-trial custody available on the 
  substantive offences occasioned virtually no prejudice to the appellant. At 
  most, with statutory remission, he would have had an additional three or four 
  months of pre-trial custody available to him. Doubled, that would amount to 
  six or eight months. In the overall scheme of things, we do not believe that 
  that additional amount of pre-trial custody would or should have had an impact 
  on the sentence imposed by the trial judge. See R. v. Rezaie (1996), 112 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.). Indeed, having regard to the gravity and seriousness of 
  the appellant's crimes, particularly those involving the kidnapping, extortion 
  and robbery of an 84 year-old woman, his substantial criminal record and his 
  inability to come to grips with the problems underlying his criminality, we 
  think the total sentence imposed by the trial judge was lenient. </p>
<p>
  [7] Although the appellant abandoned the other grounds of appeal, we think it 
  appropriate to comment on one of them. In arriving at the sentence under review, 
  the trial judge stated that the circumstances called &quot;for a sentence which 
  reflects retribution; the ability of the court to seek cold and calculated vengeance 
  upon the accused for the benefit of society and the benefit of the victim&quot;. 
  </p>
<p>
  [8] With respect, it would appear that the trial judge confused the notion of 
  retribution - a term used by Lamer C.J. in R. v. M.(C.A.) (1996), 105 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 327 S.C.C. to reflect that criminal punishment should be imposed to sanction 
  the moral culpability of the offender - and vengeance. Vengence, of course, 
  has no place in sentencing. </p>
<p>
  [9] Nonetheless, the trial judge's error occasioned no prejudice to the appellant. 
  Specifically, it did not render the total sentence unfit. Rather, as already 
  indicated, in our view, if anything, the total sentence was lenient. </p>
<p>
  [10] Accordingly, we would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal from 
  sentence.</p>
