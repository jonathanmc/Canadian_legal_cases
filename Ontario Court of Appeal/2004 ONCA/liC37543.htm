<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice W. J. Lloyd Brennan of the 
  Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on December 12, 2001.</p>
<p>
  BORINS J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, Heung-Wing Li, appeals from his conviction for sexual assault 
  following a trial before Brennan J. and a jury. There are two grounds of appeal: 
  (1) the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury by failing to inform 
  the jury of the appellant's defence and to review the evidence capable of supporting 
  the defence; (2) the trial judge erred in his instructions to the triers on 
  the proper conduct of the challenge for cause brought by the appellant. For 
  the reasons that follow, I would give effect to the second ground, allow the 
  appeal and order that a new trial be held. In addition, as I am troubled by 
  the trial judge's instructions in respect to the appellant's defence, I will 
  discuss the concern that I have with the instructions for the benefit of the 
  judge conducting the new trial.</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant is a medical doctor. At the relevant time, he carried on a 
  family practice. He was tried on four counts of sexual assault relating to four 
  complainants, each of whom alleged that he touched her breasts improperly during 
  the course of a medical examination. In relation to each count, counsel agreed 
  that the central issue was the purpose for which the appellant conducted the 
  examination of the complainant. The Crown conceded that if an examination was 
  conducted for a medical purpose, the appellant should be acquitted regardless 
  whether, on an objective standard, the examination did not conform with generally 
  accepted medical standards. The defence conceded that if the jury was satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that an examination was conducted for a sexual purpose, 
  and not for a medical purpose, it should return a verdict of guilty in respect 
  to that examination. The appellant was found guilty of sexually assaulting J.L. 
  He was acquitted of the other three counts.</p>
<p>
  Facts</p>
<p>
  [3] It is unnecessary to review the facts for the purpose of considering the 
  trial judge's instructions to the triers. However, I will provide a review of 
  the facts limited to those that are helpful in understanding my concern with 
  the instructions given to the jury relative to the appellant's defence. </p>
<p>
  [4] The complainant, J.L., had been a regular patient of the Etern Clinic for 
  several years. Normally, she was attended by her family doctor, Dr. Quan, although 
  she saw the appellant occasionally for allergy treatment. She testified that 
  prior to the incident in question, the appellant had never conducted a physical 
  examination of her, although this was contradicted by Dr. Li. In the autumn 
  of 1998, Dr. Quan had referred J.L. to a specialist for investigation of a suspected 
  lump in her left breast. The specialist performed a number of tests.</p>
<p>
  [5] When J.L. attended at the appellant's office for an allergy treatment she 
  had not yet been told the results of the tests. On seeing what appeared to be 
  a report from the specialist in her chart, she asked the appellant about the 
  results. He told her that the tests were inconclusive. Although there was a 
  controversy in the evidence as to whether J.L. asked the appellant to examine 
  her breasts, or whether the appellant proposed that he examine her breasts, 
  there was no dispute that J.L. consented to a breast examination.</p>
<p>
  [6] J.L. testified that the appellant instructed her to stand for the purpose 
  of the examination. The appellant stood behind J.L. and undid her brassiere. 
  Then he reached around her and placed one hand on each breast. She testified 
  that the appellant pressed the fingers of his left hand into her left breast 
  in a circular motion, "just like he's examining a breast", while he 
  placed his right hand on her right breast, immobile. J.L. admitted that during 
  her encounter with the appellant he made no comments of a sexual or otherwise 
  inappropriate nature.</p>
<p>
  [7] J.L. testified that while the appellant was examining her left breast, he 
  palpated the lump and told her that he had located it. She said that the appellant 
  returned to his desk after the examination and made some notes in her chart, 
  including a diagram of the left breast and the lump. The appellant was the only 
  physician who had drawn a diagram of the lump in her breast.</p>
<p>
  [8] Subsequently, J.L. felt confused and was unsure whether the appellant had 
  performed the breast examination in a proper manner. She thought that it was 
  unusual for a doctor to examine a patient's breasts while standing behind her, 
  and that it was not normal for a doctor to be touching the right breast while 
  examining the left breast. Consequently, J.L. filed a complaint with the College 
  of Physicians &amp; Surgeons of Ontario ("the College") that led to 
  the appellant's prosecution.</p>
<p>
  [9] It was the Crown's position that the appellant used the pretext of a breast 
  examination to sexually assault each of the four complainants by touching them 
  for a sexual purpose. To support this position, the Crown called two expert 
  witnesses to comment upon whether each examination conformed with proper medical 
  standards established by the College.</p>
<p>
  [10] The first expert, Dr. Chart, explained that there are two basic elements 
  to a clinical breast examination: a visual inspection of the breast and a physical 
  examination of it. Although a physical examination can take several patterns, 
  the one currently taught is the radial pattern, where the physician uses his 
  or her fingers to examine the breast in vectors or segments. The examination 
  is conducted while the patient is in a sitting position, and is then repeated 
  while the patient is lying on her back. She testified that a physician would 
  not normally hold both breasts at the same time when conducting a breast examination. 
  Dr. Chart saw no medical benefit in conducting a breast examination from behind 
  the patient.</p>
<p>
  [11] The second Crown expert, Dr. Downs, substantially agreed with Dr. Chart's 
  explanation of the deficiencies in the appellant's examination of J.L. She saw 
  no medical benefit in the manner that he conducted the examination.</p>
<p>
  [12] There was additional testimony given by Dr. Chart that the appellant contends 
  supported his defence. I will refer to this testimony after I review the evidence 
  tendered by the appellant in his defence.</p>
<p>
  [13] The appellant testified for over two days. He discussed his examination 
  of each of the four complainants. With respect to J.L.'s allegations, he relied 
  on his medical records to refresh his recollection of what had transpired when 
  he conducted her breast examination, as well as during previous encounters with 
  J.L. Contrary to J.L.'s testimony, his records showed that he had conducted 
  physical examinations of her on previous occasions, one as recently as six days 
  before the breast examination. In addition, his records document a discussion 
  with her about her breast lump two months prior to the examination in question.</p>
<p>
  [14] The appellant testified that J.L. appeared worried because the test results 
  were inconclusive. She asked him if he would examine her breasts. He explained 
  to her that he was going to show her how to conduct a breast examination in 
  a manner different from what she was used to. He gave detailed testimony about 
  the specific manner in which he conducted breast examinations while standing 
  behind a patient, stating that he conducted J.L.'s examination in the same manner 
  as he conducts all breast examinations while standing behind a patient. At the 
  conclusion of the examination, the appellant sat down with J.L. He drew three 
  diagrams in his chart and explained to her that the lump was probably benign, 
  which it was.</p>
<p>
  [15] The appellant testified that he does not perform breast examinations in 
  this manner on all occasions, but only where circumstances warrant. Because 
  J.L. had undergone numerous recent breast examinations according to the "routine 
  classical method" that were inconclusive, he believed that he might be 
  able to obtain more information about the lump by performing the examination 
  while standing behind her. He conceded that he knew that performing a breast 
  examination in this manner did not meet the "approved standard". He 
  also conceded that he had not been taught to perform a clinical breast examination 
  in this manner and that he was not aware that it was endorsed in any medical 
  literature. However, based on his own clinical experience, it was the appellant's 
  belief that this method of examination allowed him to detect breast abnormalities 
  and lumps that may not be detected by the "routine classical method" 
  of breast examination.</p>
<p>
  [16] In summary, while the appellant stated that his approach to performing 
  a breast examination may be unorthodox and not in accordance with approved medical 
  standards, he expressed his genuine and deeply held belief in its efficacy. 
  As such, he testified that he touched J.L. only for a medical purpose, and not 
  for a sexual purpose.</p>
<p>
  [17] The defence expert, Dr. Rudner, testified for an entire day. The appellant 
  submits that Dr. Rudner provided key evidence for the defence that is reviewed 
  in detail in the appellant's factum. In oral argument, counsel focused on Dr. 
  Rudner's answer to a hypothetical question and on his testimony that although 
  in ideal circumstances a physician should perform a full breast examination 
  while the patient is sitting and lying down, in a busy family practice this 
  method is truncated to permit the physician to focus on the breast with the 
  lump.</p>
<p>
  [18] It is helpful to reproduce the hypothetical question together with Dr. 
  Rudner's answer and the explanation that he gave for his answer-: </p>
<p class="indent10"> Q. [A]ssuming that Dr. Li's account of what Dr. Li testified 
  to transpired with [J.L.] is true, do you have an opinion as to whether Dr. 
  Li's encounter with [J.L.] is consistent with an appropriate medical examination?</p>
<p class="indent">A. With the assumption that what Dr. Li testified to is true 
  and accurate, in my opinion the encounter with [J.L.] consisted of an appropriate 
  medical examination.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And why is that, doctor?</p>
<p class="indent">A. In this case, we have a record of a lump in the breast that 
  has been found and has been documented as being a, clinically, a benign fibroadenoma. 
  A fine needle aspirate biopsy was done, which was inconclusive. So that leaves 
  open some uncertainty as to the exact and true nature of the breast lump. There 
  is a young woman who is apparently concerned and anxious about the lump in her 
  breast and she - consent is obtained to examine the lump in her breast. The 
  doctor, Dr. Li, proceeds to examine the breasts, the armpits. He does a cursory 
  or truncated examination of the normal breast, which is the right one; then 
  he proceeds to target the left - the lump in the left breast where he knows 
  from the ultrasound report its location. He examines the lump, locates it and 
  identifies it, and then based on his experience, confirms that it's of a benign 
  nature. He then draws a diagram, points it out to the patient explaining in 
  a diagrammatic way the origin of the lump, and proceeds to reassure her and 
  relieve her anxiety.</p>
<p class="indent">So with the exception of the examination of the breast from 
  behind, which is not approved, there is, in essence, an examination done. If 
  we look at the consistency of an examination of a person presenting with a lump 
  in a breast of uncertain origin which may be tumorous, a reassurance is sought 
  and the physician confirms the benign nature of the lump and proceeds to reinforce 
  the benign nature and hopefully relieve the patient's anxiety. This was an examination 
  of a lump in a breast [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [19] In addition to Dr. Rudner's evidence, the defence also relied on the 
  testimony of the Crown's expert, Dr. Chart, that was supportive of the appellant's 
  testimony. This testimony included: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the approved technique of breast examination involves the systematic palpation 
    of the breast with the pads of the fingers, often in a circular motion, covering 
    each quadrant of the breast;</li>
  <li>a clinical breast examination properly may be truncated in certain circumstances, 
    especially where it is focused on a specific lump;</li>
  <li>a clinical breast examination was indicated on the facts of this case, in 
    light of [J.L.'s] inquiry as to the results of the fine needle aspiration 
    and her obvious anxiety;</li>
  <li>the appellant was correct to tell [J.L.] that the results of the fine needle 
    aspiration were that the material was insufficient for analysis; and</li>
  <li>it would be appropriate to note any negative findings by way of a chart 
    or diagram and to explain any negative findings to the patient and provide 
    reassurance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In addition, Dr. Chart testified that on occasion she would simultaneously touch 
  both breasts for comparison purposes, thus contradicting the Crown's position 
  that it is never appropriate for a physician conducting a breast examination 
  to touch both breasts simultaneously.</p>
<p>
  The Instructions to the Triers on the Challenge for Cause</p>
<p>
  [20] At the outset of the trial, Crown and defence counsel agreed that potential 
  jurors would be challenged for cause based on the appellant's race. There was 
  agreement that each potential juror would be asked the following-: </p>
<p class="indent10">
  Would your ability to judge the evidence in this case without bias, prejudice 
  or partiality be affected by the fact that the person charged with the offence 
  is of East Asian Chinese origin?</p>
<p>
  [21] At the outset of the trial, the trial judge provided the jury panel with 
  a series of "boiler plate" instructions, including the following instruction 
  about juror challenges-: </p>
<p class="indent10"> In this case we have two kinds of challenge to jurors. The 
  first stage will involve the defence counsel reading a question to you, which 
  will be this question: Would your ability to judge the evidence in this case 
  without bias, prejudice or partiality be affected by the fact that the person 
  charged with the offence is of East Asian Chinese origin? Everybody will be 
  asked that same question. And as you will see shortly there's a process by which 
  the impartiality of each juror will be tested pursuant to that question. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Now, Mr. Registrar, I think we're ready to call to the front 
  our first 20. And then I'll deal with the triers.</p>
<p>
  [22] Thereafter, twenty members of the jury panel were selected to come to the 
  front of the courtroom. The trial judge then asked the registrar to select two 
  additional members of the panel to serve as the first triers, and went on to 
  give the members of the panel this explanation-: </p>
<p class="indent10">
  While the Registrar is doing that I'll explain that these two persons will be 
  asked to judge by the responses and the bearing of the person giving the response 
  to the question, whether the person can be a proper juror. I'll give you some 
  further instruction after you've been selected as triers.</p>
<p>
  [23] Following their selection, the first triers were given their instructions. 
  The remaining members of the jury panel who had not been selected to come forward 
  were present in the courtroom while the following was read to the triers-: </p>
<p class="indent10">
  Now, triers, your job is to listen to the answer that each person gives and 
  observe the person's demeanour as he or she gives the answer, and then you decide 
  whether or not that person is acceptable or not acceptable as a juror in this 
  case. An acceptable juror is one who would likely approach jury duty with an 
  open mind and decide the evidence on the case at trial, and decide the legal 
  instructions. [sic] If you are satisfied that the person would approach their 
  task with an open mind and decide this case on the evidence given here and my 
  instructions you should find that person acceptable. If you're not satisfied 
  that the person would not do that, that is approach the task with an open mind 
  and decide this case on the evidence at trial only, and my instructions, then 
  you should say: We find that person not acceptable. On each occasion that a 
  person will answer the question, you may take the time to consult with each 
  other, I invite you to do that, and then you simply indicate to me "acceptable" 
  or not "acceptable." Now, members of the prospective jury, as we go 
  through this process, you will replace the triers. So the instruction I've just 
  given to the triers will apply to future jury members who will be selecting 
  the balance of the jurors. You'll see shortly how that takes place.</p>
<p>
  [24] Following the selection of the first two members of the jury, they were 
  sworn as triers to replace the first two triers. They were instructed by the 
  trial judge that "the same instruction [given to the initial triers] applies", 
  adding: "I'm sure you remember what I said about acceptable or not acceptable." 
  No further instructions were ever given to the subsequent triers, notwithstanding 
  that some of them were not from among the "prospective jury", but 
  were selected from among an additional twenty members of the panel who were 
  selected to come forward as potential jurors.</p>
<p>
  [25] In a series of recent decisions, in affirming the principle that the selection 
  of an impartial jury is crucial to a fair trial, this court has emphasized that 
  in the context of a challenge for cause it is important that the trial judge 
  give the triers at least a general understanding of the nature of their task 
  and the procedure they are to follow. See: R. v. Moore-McFarlane (2001), 56 
  O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.); R. v. Douglas (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 583 (C.A.); R. v. Brown 
  (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 570 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [26] On the principles established by these cases, I agree with counsel for 
  the appellant that the instructions to the triers were deficient in that the 
  triers were not told that they were to decide the question on a balance of probabilities, 
  that the decision had to be that of both of them, that they had the right to 
  disagree and that they could retire to the jury room or discuss the matter right 
  where they were in the jury box. As well, it would have been preferable if the 
  triers had been provided more assistance in understanding the meaning of partiality 
  or acceptability, as well as the importance and purpose of challenging a potential 
  juror for cause on the basis of race. In Douglas, this court endorsed, and urged 
  trial judges to apply Justice Watt's specimen jury instructions as they apply 
  to challenges for cause: Watt, D., Ontario Specimen Jury Instructions, (Toronto: 
  Carswell, 2002) at 12-15. I concur in this endorsement.</p>
<p>
  [27] In addition, the general instructions that the trial judge delivered to 
  the first two triers, flawed as they were, were never repeated to successive 
  triers. Even though these instructions were delivered while remaining members 
  of the jury panel were in the courtroom, it cannot be assumed that they listened 
  to the instructions, or appreciated that they were expected to apply the instructions 
  if they became a trier. I am not suggesting that it is necessary for a trial 
  judge to fully instruct each trier when he or she is selected. In whatever way 
  a trial judge chooses to do so, he or she should instruct every trier about 
  a trier's responsibility and duty and how to carry out his or her job. In this 
  case, there was a substantial danger that at least some of the triers received 
  virtually no instructions.</p>
<p>
  [28] Therefore, I am not satisfied on the record before this court that the 
  triers had an adequate understanding of the nature of their task and the procedure 
  to be followed. In the circumstances of this case, the error was fatal. Consequently, 
  the verdict of the jury cannot stand.</p>
<p>
  The Trial Judge's Instructions to the Jury</p>
<p>
  [29] In his introductory instructions to the jury, the trial judge said that 
  it was his "duty to review the important parts of the evidence and [that 
  he would] be doing that shortly". Following instructions concerning the 
  elements of the offences of which the appellant was charged, the trial judge 
  gave the jury his "general observations with respect to the standard of 
  practice" that the expert witnesses had stated a physician should follow 
  in performing a breast examination. In the course of his observations, based 
  on the testimony of the Crown and defence experts, the trial judge discussed 
  the "points of good practice" to be followed by a physician in conducting 
  such an examination. Thereafter, he provided a detailed, twenty-one page summary 
  of the testimony of the four complainants.</p>
<p>
  [30] At the conclusion of his review of the testimony of J.L., the trial judge 
  stated-: </p>
<p class="indent10">
  Dr. Li told us that he remembered J.L.'s visit and the examination. He admitted 
  that he knew examining a patient's breasts from behind was not within the standard 
  of practice and you know that he was given a course in breast examination in 
  1996 by Dr. Chart. He maintained that he examined her from behind because he 
  thought he might learn something other doctors who examined her had not. He 
  gave no evidence of what that might be. No evidence other than his own was offered 
  to support that proposition. The evidence of Dr. Rudner called for the defence 
  did not support it. He, like Dr. Chart and Dr. Down and Dr. Yip, knew of no 
  medical benefit to such an examination [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  The only other references to the defence position during the course of the trial 
  judge's summary of J.L.'s evidence were to her consent to a breast examination 
  and the "defence [suggestion] that she was anxious [and] wanted the reassurance 
  of another opinion".</p>
<p>
  [31] Thereafter, the trial judge began his closing instructions to the jury. 
  He said: "[I] am now going to give you a very brief statement of what I 
  take to be the theory of &#133; the Crown and the defence, and after that I 
  will be sending you off &#133;to begin your deliberations." The trial judge 
  then outlined the Crown's theory. He followed this with a brief description 
  of the theory of the defence that I reproduce in its entirety-: </p>
<p class="indent10">
  The theory of the defence is that those four examinations were with consent 
  of the patient and none was for a sexual purpose. The complainants' memories 
  were challenged as faulty in every case because they do not square with the 
  medical records made at the time of the events in question, and because the 
  other visits to the clinics and to Dr. Li were forgotten or inaccurately remembered.</p>
<p>
  The defence, Dr. Li, maintains that the examination of J.L. was appropriate 
  in the circumstances, a truncated or shortened breast examination of a woman 
  with a known lump undertaken essentially to reassure her. Dr. Li maintains that 
  his performing this examination from behind was justified by his belief that 
  he could make findings that way that might add to the knowledge gained by other 
  practitioners who had already examined and advised her. He maintains that his 
  hands were placed in no improper way on the patient's body and no sexual purpose 
  was involved. Dr. Li maintains that the other patients mistook proper examinations 
  for improper ones, that the contact with the breasts of M.S., C.Y., and B.K. 
  was incidental in every case to proper examinations.</p>
<p>
  [32] The trial judge then sent the jury to deliberate, following which both 
  Crown counsel and defence counsel made substantial objections to the trial judge's 
  instructions. I will refer only to those objections relating to the instructions 
  in regard to the offence concerning J.L.</p>
<p>
  [33] Defence counsel had two significant objections. The first was that the 
  "effect of the charge considered as a whole &#133; amounted to what I believe 
  the jurors would hear &#133; that the jurors would hear as an invitation to 
  convict Dr. Li". Counsel pointed out that although the trial judge had 
  carefully reviewed the testimony of the complainants and the Crown experts, 
  he failed to provide a similar review of the appellant's testimony, his medical 
  records of J.L.'s examination and the evidence of the Crown and defence experts 
  capable of supporting the appellant's defence. In particular, defence counsel 
  was critical of the trial judge's failure to mention Dr. Rudner's response to 
  the hypothetical question that I have set out in para. 18. A transcript of the 
  response had been given to the trial judge at the pre-charge conference with 
  the request that it be included in the trial judge's review of the evidence 
  that supported Dr. Li's position.</p>
<p>
  [34] Defence counsel summarized this objection by submitting that "there 
  was a notable absence of any reference to the significant evidence that would 
  assist the defence on each of these counts, so that in essence my objection 
  is that the theory of the defence was not squarely put" to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [35] The second objection flowed from the agreement of counsel that the central 
  issue for the jury to decide was whether the appellant touched the complainant 
  for a medical purpose or a sexual purpose. The Crown conceded that if the appellant 
  touched a complainant for a medical purpose, the appellant was to be acquitted. 
  At the pre-charge conference, defence counsel reminded the trial judge that 
  the central issue was "whether or not the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that Dr. Li engaged in the touching for an honest medical purpose or for 
  an improper or sexual purpose".</p>
<p>
  [36] Defence counsel objected that the trial judge had failed to put clearly 
  to the jury the central issue in the case and also that his instructions on 
  consent were wrong and confusing. Counsel complained that the trial judge's 
  focus on whether the manner of the examination performed on J.L. conformed with 
  the standard of the College invited the jury to convict on the basis that the 
  examination failed to conform with that standard, whereas the real issue was 
  whether the examination was performed for a medical or sexual purpose. Crown 
  counsel agreed, stating "but I think that what it comes down to is [that] 
  the jury has to decide whether the purpose of his touching each of those women 
  was for a sexual purpose or a medical purpose". She added: "I think 
  it's as simple as saying to the jury that &#133; if they find that it was for 
  a medical purpose, then [the complainants] did consent."</p>
<p>
  [37] The trial judge declined to re-charge the jury with respect to defence 
  counsel's first objection, observing that "&#133; while I think I can correct 
  some errors in a charge, I don't know that I can do very much to erase the whole 
  effect of the charge overall as a whole as you express it". However, he 
  agreed to re-charge the jury on the central issue in the case and the meaning 
  of consent.</p>
<p>
  [38] Although defence counsel's objection to the re-charge was limited to the 
  trial judge's failure to conform to the requirements of R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 
  1 S.C.C. 742, in this court it was submitted that the re-charge was far from 
  clear.</p>
<p>
  [39] The appellant's defence was that although the manner in which he examined 
  the breasts of J.L. was unorthodox and did not conform with the standard set 
  by the College, he performed the examination solely for a medical purpose. The 
  appellant contends that although the trial judge summarized the position of 
  the defence at the conclusion of his instructions, he failed to provide the 
  jury with a summary of his own testimony and that he failed to relate for the 
  jury the expert testimony that was capable of supporting his defence. Defence 
  counsel objected to this omission at the conclusion of the trial judge's instructions. 
  He contended that as the trial judge had elected to provide a detailed review 
  of the evidence in support of the Crown's position, his failure to accord equal 
  treatment to the appellant's position had resulted in an unbalanced charge and 
  had thereby diminished the appellant's defence. The trial judge, although apparently 
  recognizing the force of this objection, declined to re-charge the jury.</p>
<p>
  [40] In R. v. MacKinnon (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 545 at 554-555 (Ont. C.A.) Doherty 
  J.A. discussed the principles that apply in instructing a jury in respect to 
  the position of the defence-: </p>
<p class="indent10">
  The responsibility of the trial judge to relate the evidence to the issues raised 
  by the defence is well established. In Azoulay v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 
  497-8, it was said-: </p>
<p class="indent10"> The rule which has been laid down, and consistently followed, 
  is that in a jury trial the presiding judge must, except in rare cases where 
  it would be needless to do so, review the substantial parts of the evidence 
  and give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may appreciate the 
  value and effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts 
  as they find them. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="indent">In R. v. Jacquard (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), the court 
  reiterated the obligation set out in Azoulay. Lamer C.J.C. cautioned against 
  a standard of perfection when reviewing trial judges' instructions and said, 
  at p. 11-: </p>
<p class="indent10"> As long as an appellate court, when looking at the trial judge's 
  charge to the jury as a whole, concludes that the jury was left with a sufficient 
  understanding of the facts as they relate to the relevant issues, the charge 
  is proper. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="indent">Cory J., in R. v. Cooper (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.) 
  at 301, made the same point when he observed-: </p>
<p class="indent10"> At the end of the day, the question must be whether an appellate 
  court is satisfied that the jurors would adequately understand the issues involved, 
  the law relating to the charge the accused is facing, and the evidence they 
  should consider in resolving the issues.</p>
<p class="indent">In Jacquard, Lamer C.J.C. stressed that a functional approach 
  must be taken when assessing the adequacy of jury instructions. I take this 
  to mean that instructions must be tested against their ability to fulfil the 
  purposes for which they are given and not by reference to whether any particular 
  approach or formula has been used. By the end of the instructions, whatever 
  approach is used, the jury must understand: </p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>the factual issues which had to be resolved;</li>
      <li>the law to be applied to those issues and the evidence;</li>
      <li>the positions of the parties; and</li>
      <li>the evidence relevant to the positions taken by the parties on the various 
        issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
  [41] In this case, the trial judge fulfilled the first, second and third requirements 
  of a proper jury charge. However, the fourth requirement, the relating of the 
  evidence to the positions of the parties, was not achieved. Although the trial 
  judge gave a lengthy review of the testimony of the complainants and the Crown 
  experts, he did not review either the testimony of the appellant or that of 
  the defence expert, Dr. Rudner. Nor did the trial judge review the testimony 
  of the Crown expert, Dr. Chart, that was capable of supporting the appellant's 
  defence. Consequently, the trial judge did not review any of the evidence relied 
  on by Dr. Li to support his position that his examination of J.L. was performed 
  for a medical purpose. </p>
<p>
  [42] What occurred in this case is that the trial judge gave the jury a detailed 
  review of the evidence on behalf of the Crown and related relevant portions 
  of the evidence to the Crown's position without any review of the evidence relied 
  on by the appellant as capable of supporting his defence. Having chosen to review 
  the Crown's evidence in substantial detail, the trial judge was obliged to provide 
  a similar review of the defence evidence in order to maintain an appropriate 
  balance. A trial judge's duty to give a jury balanced instructions is based 
  on the need to ensure trial fairness. In my view, the trial judge's failure 
  to place the appellant's defence and the evidence capable of supporting it before 
  the jury, undermined the defence and materially prejudiced the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [43] In addition, the trial judge failed to properly charge the jury concerning 
  the heart of the appellant's defence. As I have stated, the appellant's defence 
  was that even though his examination of J.L. did not conform with the standards 
  set by the College, it was nevertheless a medical examination carried out for 
  a medical purpose to which J.L. consented. In my view, had the trial judge maintained 
  an appropriate balance to his instructions, necessarily he would have placed 
  the central issue in the case before the jury.</p>
<p>
  [44] There is an unusual feature of this case that has caused me to stop short 
  of founding my decision to order a new trial because of the flaws in the jury 
  charge. The jury acquitted the appellant of the other three counts of sexual 
  assault, notwithstanding that the inadequacies in the charge also applied to 
  the appellant's defence to these charges. These acquittals suggest that the 
  shortcomings in the charge may not have been fatal, although the acquittals 
  may also be explained by the obvious difficulties with the credibility of the 
  other three complainants. In addition, in none of these instances was a breast 
  examination carried out while the appellant stood behind the patient. In any 
  event, for the reasons that I have discussed there are significant deficiencies 
  in the instructions concerning the appellant's defence to the charge of which 
  he was convicted.</p>
<p>
  Result</p>
<p>
  [45] For the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the appellant's 
  conviction and order that there be a new trial.</p>
