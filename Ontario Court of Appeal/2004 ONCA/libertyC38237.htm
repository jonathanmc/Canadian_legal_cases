<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Nancy L. Backhouse of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated May 9, 2002.</p>
<p>
  SHARPE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The issue on this appeal is whether an insurer under a comprehensive general 
  liability policy is obliged to provide a defence to a claim of intentional discrimination.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant Liberty Mutual Insurance Company ("Liberty") issued 
  a comprehensive general liability insurance policy to the respondents Hollinger 
  Inc., Hollinger International Inc. and the Ravelston Corporation Limited ("Hollinger"). 
  Carl Rowan, a well-known journalist, sued The Chicago Sun Times, Hollinger's 
  subsidiary, for wrongful dismissal. Rowan included in his claim allegations 
  of intentional racial and age discrimination. Hollinger advised Liberty of the 
  claim, retained counsel and eventually settled the case. Hollinger then tendered 
  the claim to Liberty, requesting a contribution to the cost of defence and indemnity 
  with respect to the discrimination claims. Liberty refused and sought a declaration 
  that it owed no duty to defend Hollinger. Backhouse J., the application judge, 
  ruled that Liberty was required to provide Hollinger with a defence and dismissed 
  the application. For the reasons that follow, I disagree with the result reached 
  by the application judge and conclude that Liberty is not required to provide 
  Hollinger with a defence to the discrimination claims. </p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  (i) THE CLAIM </p>
<p> [3] Rowan's amended complaint (statement of claim) advanced five causes of 
  action: </p>
<ul>
  <li>breach of contract;</li>
  <li>constructive discharge;</li>
  <li>racial discrimination contrary to the District of Columbia Human Rights 
    Act;</li>
  <li>age discrimination contrary to the District of Columbia Human Rights Act;</li>
  <li>age and racial discrimination in violation of the United States Civil Rights 
    Act.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [4] Hollinger does not suggest that Liberty is required by the policy to provide 
  a defence with respect to the first two causes of action, but asserts the right 
  to a defence with respect to the three claims based upon racial and age discrimination. 
  It is apparent from the manner in which the Amended Complaint is drafted that 
  Rowan alleged intentional discrimination in violation of the District of Columbia 
  Human Rights Act and the United States Civil Rights Act. Rowan claimed that 
  after the Sun Times came under the control of Hollinger, management "entered 
  upon a calculated policy" of changing the newspaper's orientation towards 
  a "white" audience and "brazenly" set out to remove "Black 
  images", including Rowan's columns, from the newspaper. The acts of discrimination 
  alleged against Hollinger are described in the following manner in para. 34 
  of the Amended Complaint: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It was inconsistent with Defendant's new policies for Defendant to continue 
  publishing three (3) columns each week by Mr. Rowan, who is African-American 
  and who was then and continues to be highly supportive of African-American and 
  civil rights causes. Accordingly, Defendant wilfully, wantonly, maliciously, 
  and deliberately entered upon the course of action&#133;designed with a discriminatory 
  purpose against Mr. Rowan on account of his race, either to terminate the Employment 
  Contract or to force Mr. Rowan to conclude that his services for Defendant were 
  effectively being terminated by Defendant. </p>
<p>
  Similar allegations of intentional discrimination were made with regard to age 
  discrimination.</p>
<p>
  (ii) THE POLICY</p>
<p> [5] Liberty, a Canadian insurer based in Toronto, issued a comprehensive general 
  liability policy to Hollinger for its business activities throughout the world. 
  The policy provided coverage to Hollinger for claims made against it for bodily 
  injury, property damage and personal injury.</p>

<p>
  JUDGMENT OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE</p>
<p>
  [8] Before the application judge, Liberty's case essentially rested on the exclusion 
  for claims arising from "the wilful violation of a penal statute." 
  The application judge found that the discrimination claims were framed as wilful 
  discrimination but that as the claims were not based upon "a penal statute" 
  they were covered. She held that while both the District of Columbia Human Rights 
  Act and the United States Civil Rights Act contained enforcement provisions 
  providing for fines and imprisonment, Rowan's claims for compensatory and punitive 
  damages were advanced under provisions allowing for private rights of action 
  against a wrongdoer. She referred to both Canadian and American authority classifying 
  human rights legislation as remedial rather than penal. She relied on the principle 
  that if there is a "mere possibility" that the allegations as pleaded 
  fall within the coverage of the policy, the insurer is required to provide a 
  defence (Nichols v. American Home Assurance Co., [1990] 1 S.C.R. 801) and noted 
  that any uncertainty on the issue of coverage must be resolved in favour of 
  the insured (Slough Estates Canada v. Federal Pioneer Ltd (1995), 20 O.R. (3d) 
  429).</p>
<p>
  ISSUE</p>
<p>
  [9] Does the policy require the insurer to provide a defence to the claims of 
  intentional discrimination?</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [10] It is common ground that the Policy is governed by the law of Ontario. 
  Hollinger is "a person resident in Ontario" and the contract was executed 
  and delivered in Ontario. Section 123 of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  I.8 provides that in these circumstances, the contract shall be construed according 
  to the law of Ontario. </p>
<p>
  [11] It is also common ground that the test laid down in Nichols, supra at 810, 
  applies and that while "the duty to defend arises only where the pleadings 
  raise claims which would be payable" under the policy of insurance, "it 
  is not necessary to prove that that obligation to indemnify will in fact arise 
  to trigger the duty to defend. The mere possibility that a claim within the 
  policy may succeed suffices." </p>
<p>
  [12] Before this court, Liberty's contention that acts of intentional discrimination 
  are not covered rests on three grounds: first, by its terms, such claims are 
  excluded under Article 11(a)(i) as a "wilful violation of a penal statute"; 
  second, according to the "fortuity principle", indemnity insurance 
  covers only fortuitous acts of the insurer and intentional harm is excluded; 
  and third, it would be contrary to public policy to permit insurance coverage 
  for intentional discrimination. In fairness to the application judge, I would 
  point out that the second two grounds do not appear to have been the focus of 
  Liberty's submission below. I also observe here that no issue is raised with 
  respect to estoppel or non-waiver despite the fact that the duty to defend issue 
  was not presented until after the Rowan action had been settled. </p>
<p>
  [13] I agree with the application judge that the claims do not fall within the 
  exclusion for claims arising out of the "wilful violation of a penal statute". 
  Although both the District of Columbia Human Rights Act and the United States 
  Civil Rights Act both provide for fines and imprisonment in certain instances, 
  the claims at issue here cannot fairly be characterized as penal in nature. 
  The application judge aptly disposed of this issue in the following passage 
  at para. 6: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The enforcement provisions of both the District of Columbia Human Rights Act 
  and the United States Civil Rights Act provide for fines and imprisonment. The 
  statutes also provide a private right of action against a wrongdoer. The Rowan 
  claim does not refer to specific sections of either statute. It claims "compensatory 
  damages" and does not seek to enforce a penalty. Where a statute is both 
  penal and remedial, authority exists for considering it a "remedial statute" 
  when it is sought to enforce the civil remedy and as a "penal statute" 
  when it is sought to enforce the penalty. (Collins v. Kidd, 38 F.Supp. 634, 
  637). Similar legislation in Canada has been found to be remedial legislation. 
  (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Ontario (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 387 at 394 
  (C.A.); Westend Construction Ltd. et al v. Ontario Human Rights Commission et 
  al (1989), 62 D.L.R. (4th) 329).</p>
<p>[14] This analysis coincides with that of Dickson C.J.C. in Action Travail 
  des Femmes v. Canadian National Railway Co. et al. (1987), 40 D.L.R. (4th) 193 
  at 206-207: "The purpose of the [Canadian Human Rights] Act is not to punish 
  wrongdoing but to prevent discrimination&#133;there is no indication that the 
  purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Act is to assign or to punish moral blameworthiness." 
  </p>
<p>
  [15] I will next consider Liberty's argument that the Policy does not cover 
  claims of intentional discrimination. Apart from the exclusion clause, there 
  are certain features of the Policy that would appear, on their face, to allow 
  for coverage for claims of intentional discrimination. Claims of discrimination 
  in Article 9 are but one aspect of a broader category of claims for "personal 
  injury" and several of the itemized categories falling within that general 
  category involve intentional wrongdoing. For example, coverage is provided for 
  claims for false arrest, detention or imprisonment, and malicious prosecution. 
  These causes of action are intentional torts and ordinarily require a high level 
  of intentional conduct. </p>
<p>
  [16] However, I agree with Liberty that this language must be read and interpreted 
  in light of a general principle of insurance law that arises from the very nature 
  and purpose of insurance, namely, that ordinarily only fortuitous or contingent 
  losses are covered by a liability policy. Where an insured intends to cause 
  the very harm that gives rise to the claim, the insured cannot look to a liability 
  policy for indemnity. This principle was explained by Iacobucci J. in his concurring 
  judgment in Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyld's of London v. Scalera, [2000] 1 
  S.C.R. 551 at paras. 68-69: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is important to keep in mind the underlying economic rationale for insurance. 
  C. Brown and J. Menezes, Insurance Law in Canada (2nd ed. 1991), state this 
  point well at pp. 125-26: </p>
<p class="indent"> Insurance is a mechanism for transferring fortuitous contingent 
  risks. Losses that are neither fortuitous nor contingent cannot economically 
  be transferred because the premium would have to be greater than the value of 
  the subject matter in order to provide for marketing and adjusting costs and 
  a profit for the insurer. It follows, therefore, that even where the literal 
  working of a policy might appear to cover certain losses, it does not, in fact, 
  do so if (1) the loss is from the inherent nature of the subject matter being 
  insured, or (2) it results from the intentional actions of the insured.</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, insurance usually makes economic sense only 
  where the losses covered are unforeseen or accidental: "The assumptions on which 
  insurance is based are undermined if successful claims arise out of loss which 
  is not fortuitous" (C. Brown, Insurance Law in Canada (3rd ed. 1997), at p. 
  4). This economic rationale takes on a public policy flavour where, as here, 
  the acts for which the insured is seeking coverage are socially harmful. It 
  may be undesirable to encourage people to injure others intentionally by indemnifying 
  them from the civil consequences. On the other hand, denying coverage has the 
  undesirable effect of precluding recovery against a judgment-proof defendant, 
  thus perhaps discouraging sexual assault victims from bringing claims. See B. 
  Feldthusen, "The Civil Action for Sexual Battery: Therapeutic Jurisprudence?" 
  (1993), 25 Ottawa L. Rev. 203, at p. 233.</p>
<p>[17] I agree with Liberty's submission that by its terms, the Policy is an 
  occurrence based liability policy that only covers accidental or fortuitous 
  losses. Article 14(d) provides that "[w]hen an accident or occurrence takes 
  place", the insured is required to provide written notice "of such 
  accident or occurrence". Article 12 also limits the liability of the insurer 
  by certain specified amounts "for any one occurrence or accident or series 
  of occurrences or accidents arising out of one cause". For the purposes 
  of liability insurance, the Supreme Court of Canada in Stats v. Mutual of Omaha 
  Insurance Co., [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1153 and this court in Murphy v. Lloyd's of London 
  (2000), 137 O.A.C. 10 adopted the meaning attributed to the word "accident" 
  by the House of Lords in Fenton v. J. Thorley &amp; Co. Ltd., [1903] A.C. 443 
  at 448: "[T]he expression 'accident' is used in the popular and ordinary 
  sense of the word as denoting an unlooked-for mishap or an untoward event which 
  is not expected or designed." The word "occurrence" as used in 
  the policy, is defined at Article 9(c) as "an event or a continuous or 
  repeated exposure during the policy period to conditions which, from the standpoint 
  of the Insured, unexpectedly causes injury". Like the definition of "accident", 
  this definition emphasizes the fortuitous and unexpected nature of the covered 
  loss. </p>
<p>
  [18] The fortuity principle does not exclude coverage for all claims that arise 
  from intentional acts. An intentional act may have unintended consequences. 
  If the unintended consequence falls within the terms of the policy, it will 
  be covered even if it was caused by the intentional act of the insured. This 
  distinction is reflected by the terms of s. 118 of the Insurance Act, which 
  provides that the "contravention of any criminal or other law&#133;does 
  not, by that fact alone, render unenforceable a claim for indemnity under a 
  contract of insurance except where the contravention is committed by the insured&#133;with 
  intent to bring about loss or damage". The fortuity principle is explained 
  in relation to claims for discrimination by F.J. Mootz, "Insurance Coverage 
  of Employment Discrimination Claims" (1997) 52 U. Miami L. Rev. 1 at 32,38: </p>
<p class="indent"> The general rule in this regard, known as the principle of 
  "fortuity," is that "a contract of insurance to indemnify a person for damages 
  resulting from his own intentional misconduct is void as against public policy 
  and courts will not enforce such a contract." In this context, it is important 
  to read "intentional" narrowly. Many courts recognize that public policy does 
  not prohibit insurance coverage for all liabilities incurred due to intentional 
  torts, but instead precludes coverage only for liabilities arising out of conduct 
  intended to cause harm. Put differently, public policy is implicated only when 
  an employer seeks indemnification for injuries that it intended to inflict, 
  and not when an employer seeks coverage for intentional actions that have resulted 
  in injuries. If it is accurate to say that courts "make insurance" with the 
  doctrine of reasonable expectations, then it is no less accurate to say that 
  they also "unmake insurance" with the public policy limitation on enforcement 
  of policy terms.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">[I]f the wrongful act amounts to a purposeful effort by the 
  employer to cause injury to the employee, courts generally will still refuse 
  to enforce otherwise available insurance for reasons of public policy. </p>
<p>
  A similar statement on the distinction between intentional acts and intentional 
  harms is found in C. Brown et al., Insurance Law in Canada, looseleaf (Toronto: 
  Carswell, 2002) at 18-178 to 18-179: "The courts will be alert to the distinction 
  between the intention to cause the injury itself&#133; and the intention to 
  commit the act that causes injury&#133;the exclusion applies to the former, 
  but not necessarily to the latter." See also Hodgkinson v. Economical Mutual 
  Insurance Co., [2003] O.J. No. 5125 (C.A.), where Morden J.A. found that it 
  is the presence or absence of an intent to injure that is determinative when 
  deciding whether coverage should be excluded. </p>
<p>
  [19] In my view, Rowan's claims of discrimination cannot be described as claims 
  for accidental or fortuitous loss nor can they be qualified as claims for the 
  unintended consequence of an intentional act. They are, rather, claims of intentional 
  wrongdoing and arise from allegations that Hollinger intended to inflict the 
  very wrong of which Rowan complains. It follows that Rowan's claims fall outside 
  the terms of the Policy and that Liberty is not required to provide Hollinger 
  with a defence.</p>
<p>
  [20] Hollinger argues that while Rowan's claim is framed in terms of intentional 
  discrimination, it pleads underlying facts that could result in a finding of 
  unintentional or disparate impact discrimination, and that therefore the duty 
  to defend does arise. I am unable to accept that argument. As explained by Iacobucci 
  J. in Scalera at paras. 50-52, when determining whether a claim triggers the 
  duty to defend there is a three-step process. First, the court must assess the 
  pleading and "look beyond the choice of labels, and examine the substance 
  of the allegations contained in the pleadings." As I have already explained, 
  there can be little doubt that the substance of Rowan's claims is an allegation 
  of intentional discrimination. The second step is to determine whether any claims 
  are derivative in nature: "If the alleged negligence is based on the same 
  harm as the intentional tort, it will not allow the insured to avoid the exclusion 
  clause for intentionally caused injuries." In this case, any suggestion 
  of indirect or adverse impact discrimination in the claim is, in my view, entirely 
  derivative of the claim of intentional discrimination. The third step is to 
  determine "whether any of the&#133;non-derivative claims could potentially 
  trigger the insurer's duty to defend". For reasons I have already explained, 
  I have concluded that none of the non-derivative intentional discrimination 
  claims qualify in this regard.</p>
<p>
  [21] While I would decide this appeal on the basis of the fortuity principle, 
  Liberty's third argument, that of public policy, should also be mentioned as 
  it is not entirely distinct in nature. As suggested by Iacobucci J. in the passage 
  quoted above from Scalera, there is an overlap between the fortuity principle 
  and public policy. The fortuity principle arises from the economics of insurance, 
  but it also has a "public policy flavour" as "[i]t may be undesirable 
  to encourage people to injure others intentionally by indemnifying them from 
  the civil consequences" of their wrongful conduct. On the other hand, Iacobucci 
  J. also noted in the same passage that denying coverage may have "the undesirable 
  effect of precluding recovery against a judgment-proof defendant". Clearly, 
  these two policies may potentially conflict since the former tends to narrow 
  the scope of coverage while the latter broadens it. </p>
<p>
  [22] It is hardly necessary to cite legal authority for the proposition that 
  discrimination is contrary to the public policy of Ontario. The preamble to 
  the Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H-19 contains a clear statement to that 
  effect: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [I]t is public policy in Ontario to recognize the dignity and worth of every 
  person and to provide for equal rights and opportunities without discrimination 
  that is contrary to law, and having as its aim the creation of a climate of 
  understanding and mutual respect for the dignity and worth of each person so 
  that each person feels a part of the community and able to contribute fully 
  to the development and well-being of the community and the Province.</p>
<p>
  [23] Although the issue of whether insurance coverage for discrimination claims 
  is contrary to public policy does not appear to have been considered by any 
  Canadian court, there is an extensive body of American authority on this point. 
  Most American courts that have considered the question have excluded insurance 
  coverage for claims of intentional discrimination: see e.g. Boston Housing Authority 
  v. Atlanta International Insurance Company, National Casualty Company, Covenant 
  Mutual Insurance Company, 781 F. Supp. 80 (D. Mass. 1992); American Guarantee 
  and Liability Insurance Company v. Vista Medical Supply, 699 F. Supp. 787 (N.D. 
  Cal. 1988); Save Mart Supermarkets v. Underwriters at Lloyd's London, Sphere 
  Drake Insurance PLC, 843 F. Supp. 597 (N.D. Cal. 1993). These courts have dismissed 
  such claims on the basis of the fortuity principle and as well on grounds of 
  public policy: see Mootz, supra. </p>
<p>
  [24] On the other hand, the American courts have, for the most part, distinguished 
  intentional or "disparate treatment" discrimination from unintended 
  or "disparate impact" claims and allowed liability insurance coverage 
  for the latter. For example, in Solo Cup Company v. Federal Insurance Company 
  619 F.2d 1178 (7th Cir. 1980), the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals held that insurance 
  coverage of disparate impact liability is not contrary to the public interest 
  against employment discrimination as embodied in Title VII. The court held that 
  allowing insurance coverage for disparate impact liability would not injure 
  the public good, and indeed might promote the objects of the legislation as 
  insurers would likely encourage and facilitate the evaluation of employment 
  standards. </p>
<p>
  [25] I note here that in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations 
  Commission) v. B.C.G.S.E.U, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected 
  the distinction between intentional and disparate impact discrimination in the 
  context of bona fide occupational requirements. The Court replaced the conventional 
  categorization of discrimination as "direct" or "adverse effect" 
  with a unified approach. Writing for the unanimous Court, McLachlin C.J.C. stated 
  at para. 25: </p>
<p class="indent">
  However well this [conventional] approach may have served us in the past, many 
  commentators have suggested that it ill-serves the purpose of contemporary human 
  rights legislation. I agree. In my view, the complexity and unnecessary artificiality 
  of aspects of the conventional analysis attest to the desirability of now simplifying 
  the guidelines that structure the interpretation of human rights legislation 
  in Canada.</p>
<p>
  McLachlin C.J.C.'s statement would appear to undermine the applicability in 
  Canada of a public policy analysis based upon a distinction between direct and 
  indirect discrimination. However, as I have already observed, for the purposes 
  of insurance law, there is a well-recognized distinction to be drawn between 
  fortuitous or accidental harm and harm that is caused intentionally. I do not 
  consider that distinction to be affected by the holding in B.C.G.S.E.U., even 
  in relation to discrimination claims. I would, therefore, decide this appeal 
  on the basis of the fortuity principle and leave the broader public policy issue 
  of insurance coverage for claims of discrimination for another day.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [26] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal and grant an order declaring 
  that Liberty is not under a duty to defend Hollinger under the Policy with respect 
  to the Rowan claims. I would award the appellant costs of the appeal fixed at 
  $17,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
