<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Blenus Wright of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated July 22, 2002.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>ROSENBERG J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal and cross-appeal from a judgment of Wright J. with respect 
  to a commercial tenancy. The trial judge found that an Offer to Lease dated 
  July 28, 1997 was invalid and that the appellant tenants were therefore only 
  month-to-month tenants. The principal ground of appeal concerns the effect of 
  the trial judge&#146;s decision to exclude one of the parties from the courtroom 
  while her husband, the other party, testified. </p>
<p>[2] The principal issue on the cross-appeal concerns the trial judge&#146;s 
  decision with respect to arrears of rent and business taxes. The landlord submits 
  that the trial judge erred in holding that the landlord had waived these arrears. 
  A complicating feature in both the appeal and cross-appeal is the effect of 
  s. 13 of the Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.23, providing that in an action 
  by or against the executors of an estate, an opposite party shall not obtain 
  judgment on his or her own evidence in respect of any matter occurring before 
  the death of the deceased, unless such evidence is corroborated by some other 
  material evidence.</p>
<p>[3] For the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal 
  in part.</p>
<p>THE FACTS</p>
<p> The lease issue</p>
<p>[4] The appellants, Peter and Annie Chau, have operated a hair salon since 
  1986 in the basement of a building formerly owned by Dr. Sim Fai Liu. I will 
  refer to the Chaus as the tenants. The 1986 lease was renewed for a further 
  six years pursuant to an Offer to Lease dated June 25, 1991. The renewed lease 
  expired in June 1997. In 1996, the tenants spent a substantial amount of money 
  to renovate and expand the salon. </p>
<p>[5] In May of 1997, the tenants submitted a hand-written Offer to Lease for 
  a further eight years with a renewal option for a further eight years. Dr. Liu 
  did not accept that offer. At the time, according to the tenants, Dr. Liu said 
  he could not read the writing and would have someone prepare a typed Offer to 
  Lease. He had his lawyers prepare an Offer to Lease. This standard form lease, 
  which is dated July 1, 1997, was for a five year term. It included many terms, 
  such as deposit for rent, maintenance of a parking lot, shovelling snow and 
  so on that were not applicable to these premises. </p>
<p>[6] The tenants testified that on July 28, 1997, they met with Dr. Liu and 
  discussed the July 1, 1997 Offer to Lease. They testified that Dr. Liu began 
  crossing out the various terms that were not applicable to this tenancy. Dr. 
  Liu initialled the first three of these changes but then, because there were 
  so many, he used a thick black pen to cross out the inapplicable terms and simply 
  stopped initialling the changes. The tenants testified that Peter Chau changed 
  the term of the lease from five years to eight years with an option to renew 
  for a further eight years. The tenants initialled these changes but Dr. Liu 
  did not. They testified that Dr. Liu said, &#147;[d]on&#146;t worry. The bottom 
  &#133; say &#145;acceptance&#146;. When I sign my name on it everything will 
  be fine. &#133; Don&#146;t you trust me?&#148; Dr. Liu&#146;s signature does 
  appear on the last page as do the signatures of the tenants. According to the 
  tenants, Dr. Liu put red seals beside their names and the tenants and Dr. Liu 
  each took a copy of the revised Offer to Lease now dated July 28, 1997.</p>
<p>[7] The tenants continued to occupy the premises and, as in the past, provided 
  Dr. Liu with twelve post-dated cheques for rent. Dr. Liu passed away on April 
  22, 1999. In October 1999, a dispute arose between Dr. Liu&#146;s widow, Edith 
  Liu, and the tenants. Mrs. Liu took the position that the tenants were month-to-month 
  tenants and could be removed at any time. The tenants relied upon the 1997 lease. 
  Mrs. Liu claimed to know nothing about the lease. The tenants provided a copy 
  to her. She sent the copy to her lawyer and received advice that the lease was 
  invalid. The lawyers wrote to the tenant and confirmed that this was a month-to-month 
  tenancy. The tenants remained in the premises and very little of any consequence 
  occurred until August 2001 when Mrs. Liu sold the building and her lawyer wrote 
  the tenants demanding that they vacate the premises. The tenants refused.</p>
<p>[8] The Estate of Dr. Liu brought an application for a declaration that the 
  tenants were month-to-month tenants. It also sought an order terminating the 
  tenancy and fixing the arrears of rent, including business taxes.</p>
<p> The arrears issues</p>
<p>[9] Under the 1991 lease the tenants were to pay monthly rent as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">July 1991 to June 1993: $1,870 plus GST</p>
<p class="indent">July 1993 to June 1995: $2,000 plus GST</p>
<p class="indent">July 1995 to June 1997: $2,200 plus GST</p>
<p>[10] The tenants were also to pay their share of the realty and business taxes. 
  At that time, the city of Toronto sent a business tax bill directly to tenants. 
  That system changed in 1998. The business tax was rolled into the realty tax 
  and the city sent the bill to the landlord and it was up to the landlord to 
  obtain reimbursement from tenants for their share of the taxes. Under the 1991 
  lease, the tenants should have been paying $2,000 plus GST since July 1993 and 
  $2,200 plus GST since July 1995. In fact, they had only been paying $2,000. 
  The tenants testified that because of the recession, business was bad and so 
  in 1993 Dr. Liu told them to leave the rent at $2000.90 ($1870 plus GST).<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  They had a similar conversation with him in July 1995. The tenants also testified 
  that they paid their share of the realty taxes, but at Dr. Liu&#146;s request, 
  paid in cash.</p>
<p>[11] Under the 1997 &#147;lease&#148;, the tenants were to pay monthly rent 
  as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">July 1997 to June 2001: $2,000</p>
<p class="indent">July 2001 to June 2003: $2,200</p>
<p class="indent">July 2003 to June 2005: $2,400</p>
<p>[12] The clause in the lease requiring the tenants to pay GST had been crossed 
  out and initialled by the tenants, but not by Dr. Liu. The tenants were also 
  to pay their own business taxes. Peter Chau testified that at the July 28, 1997 
  meeting they discussed the costs of the renovations that tenants had made the 
  year before. According to Mr. Chau, Dr. Liu said that they could pay the $2,000 
  rent to the end of December 2001 and they would not have to reimburse him for 
  the first $10,000 of the business taxes. The renovations had cost about $20,000 
  so, in effect, Dr. Liu would be paying for about one-half of the renovations. 
  Under the 1991 lease, the tenants were solely responsible for the costs of the 
  renovations. </p>
<p>[13] The notice of application was issued in September 2001. The Estate claimed 
  arrears for rent because the tenants were not paying $2,200 plus GST from 1995 
  to 1997 but only $2,000 and from July 2001 to November 2001 because the tenants 
  were only paying $2,000 instead of $2,200 as required under the 1997 &#147;lease&#148;. 
  The Estate also claimed arrears for realty taxes from December 1995 to December 
  31 1997 and arrears for business taxes from January 1998 to November 2001.</p>
<p>THE REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</p>
<p>[14] The trial judge doubted that Dr. Liu would have accepted the July 28, 
  1997 Offer to Lease with all of the handwritten changes without having had it 
  retyped. He also was of the view that Dr. Liu was in the habit of initialling 
  changes. He found it was probable that Dr. Liu had made the few changes that 
  were initialled, signed the Offer to Lease and gave it to the tenants some time 
  in June. He found it unlikely that Dr. Liu made the &#147;don&#146;t you trust 
  me?&#148; statement on July 28th. In the trial judge&#146;s view, Dr. Liu&#146;s 
  initials do not appear on the various changes, especially those extending the 
  lease to eight years with an option to renew for a further eight years, because 
  he did not agree with them. He thought it made no sense that Dr. Liu would do 
  a &#147;complete turn around&#148; and agree to those terms. The trial judge 
  found it strange that Mrs. Liu has been unable to locate Dr. Liu&#146;s copy 
  of the July 28th lease. The trial judge also had difficulty accepting that the 
  discussions respecting the business taxes took place. The trial judge found 
  as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">I do not accept the Chaus&#146; evidence. It is not credible. 
  Their evidence makes no common sense. The weight of the evidence supports my 
  finding that it is more probable that Dr. Liu did not agree to the changes made 
  on the July 28, 1997 Offer to Lease which he did not initial and did not sign 
  on July 28, 1997, as accepting the changes.</p>
<p>[15] The trial judge therefore found that the July 28, 1997 Offer to Lease 
  was not a valid document and the tenants had been month-to-month tenants since 
  July 1, 1997. </p>
<p>[16] The trial judge then turned to the arrears of rent, business and property 
  taxes. He found that Dr. Liu was prepared to allow the tenants to remain provided 
  they paid the $2,000 per month rent rather than having to evict them and risk 
  not being able to find a new tenant. There was no evidence of any demand for 
  payment of any arrears and no evidence of any document purporting to advise 
  the tenants that they owed any amounts to Dr. Liu. While there were letters 
  from the Estate&#146;s lawyer advising the tenants that they were month-to-month 
  tenants there was no demand for arrears. The trial judge held that in view of 
  this course of conduct, the Estate had waived its right to any arrears:</p>
<p class="indent">I find that from December 1995, to the commencement of this application in 
  September 2001, Dr. Liu and the Estate engaged in a course of consistent conduct 
  not to demand of or indicate to the tenants that they owed any arrears of rent 
  or arrears of business or property taxes. I find that that course of conduct 
  constitutes a waiver of the right to now claim those arrears.</p>
<p>[17] The trial judge therefore dismissed the claim for payment of arrears. 
  He terminated the tenancy and ordered that a writ of possession could issue.</p>
<p>ANALYSIS</p>
<p> The appeal</p>
<p> Exclusion of Annie Chau from the trial</p>
<p>[18] At the opening of the trial, counsel for the tenants asked for an order 
  excluding witnesses. The trial judge made the order. It appears that the tenants 
  remained in the courtroom during the plaintiff&#146;s case. Counsel for the 
  tenants began their case by calling Peter Chau. Before he began testifying, 
  counsel for the Estate noted that Annie Chau was in the courtroom and asked 
  if that was appropriate. He pointed out that there was an order excluding witnesses 
  and, though she was a party, &#147;surely the order would apply to somebody 
  who is going to hear the evidence of her husband&#148;. Counsel for the tenants 
  stated that she was a party and entitled to be in the courtroom and not excluded. 
  The trial judge said this:</p>
<p class="indent">But I believe that the issue is clearly one of credibility as to the authenticity 
  of the July 28th document so therefore I think probably it&#146;s better that 
  she be excluded in fairness to the plaintiff. </p>
<p>[19] The trial judge directed that Annie Chau leave the courtroom. Peter Chau 
  then testified. His testimony was lengthy and detailed. It was apparent that 
  he had the most dealings with Dr. Liu, but Mrs. Chau was present for the July 
  28th meeting. After Mr. Chau completed his testimony, Annie Chau testified. 
  She required the assistance of an interpreter. Her testimony was briefer than 
  that of her husband&#146;s. Her evidence was essentially similar to that of 
  Mr. Chau. Peter Chau had testified that the meetings with Dr. Liu were partly 
  in English and partly in Chinese. Annie Chau testified that her husband would 
  translate the English parts of the conversations for her.</p>
<p>[20] The trial judge&#146;s direction that Annie Chau leave the courtroom for 
  part of the trial was contrary to rule 52.06(2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. 
  That rule provides, in part, that an order for exclusion of witnesses &#147;may 
  not be made in respect of a party to the action&#148;. The judge may, however, 
  direct that a party give evidence before any other witnesses. As well, under 
  rule 52.06(4), the trial judge may exclude from the courtroom &#147;any person 
  who is interfering with the proper conduct of the trial&#148;. That exception 
  had no application in this case.</p>
<p>[21] Counsel for the Estate suggests that the trial judge has a discretion 
  to exclude a party, especially where credibility is in issue. He referred us 
  to the decision in Rando v. 917429 Ontario Ltd., [1998] O.J. No. 2640 where 
  Ground J. granted a motion for an order excluding the co-defendant from the 
  hearing. It is not, however, clear that case concerned exclusion of a party 
  at trial. In his brief endorsement, Ground J. referred to the decision of the 
  British Columbia Court of Appeal in Sissons and Simmons v. Olson (1951), 1 W.W.R. 
  507 as the leading authority. Sissons deals with exclusion of a party while 
  his co-plaintiff was being examined for discovery. The endorsement also makes 
  no reference to rule 52.06. I do not think Rando is authority for the trial 
  judge having discretion to exclude a party from the trial.</p>
<p>[22] In Changoo v. Changoo (1999), 33 C.P.C. (4th) 86 (Ont. S.C.J.), a ruling 
  on a motion by the plaintiff to cross-examine each of the three defendants on 
  their affidavits in the absence of the others, Cullity J. provides some assistance 
  in interpreting rule 52.06. He expressed the view that aside from the provisions 
  of rule 52.06(4) which, as indicated, permits the trial judge to exclude any 
  person who is interfering with the proper conduct of the trial, the judge may 
  have the power to exclude a party by virtue of rule 2.03 which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">The court may, only where and as necessary in the interests of justice, dispense 
  with compliance with any rule at any time.</p>
<p>[23] I need not decide whether it is open to a trial judge to invoke rule 2.03 
  and dispense with compliance with rule 52.06(2). In this case, the rationale 
  for excluding Ms. Chau was that credibility was in issue. The concern, one can 
  assume, is the possibility that Ms. Chau would tailor her evidence so that it 
  would be consistent with that of her husband. That was not a sufficient basis 
  for dispensing with the rule. See Changoo at paras. 13 &#150; 17. Excluding 
  a party because of the possibility she will tailor her evidence does not give 
  proper weight to the true basis for the party&#146;s right to be present. As 
  Borins D.C.J. said in Baywood Paper Products Ltd. v. Paymaster Cheque-Writers 
  (Canada) Ltd. (1986), 57 O.R. (2d) 229 at 239, &#147;[t]he presence of a party 
  at the examination for discovery, like the presence of a party at trial, is 
  consistent with due process and the right to protect his or her interests by 
  observing the conduct of the examination.&#148; </p>
<p>[24] Given the fundamental nature of the right to be present, the circumstances 
  in which a trial judge would be justified in ordering that a party not be present 
  during a part of the trial would have to be exceptional. For example, a real 
  probability of intimidation (Changoo at para. 12) or the circumstances referred 
  to by O&#146;Halloran J.A. in the Sissons case at p. 509:</p>
<p class="indent">It seems to me, with respect, we must start with the principle that every person 
  has an inherent right to be present at a trial or any other proceedings to which 
  he is a party. Such a right, however, must not conflict with the fair and proper 
  judicial conduct of the action or proceedings. Inherent rights are invariably 
  accompanied by concomitant duties. For example if a party should act in a manner 
  to disturb the judicial conduct of the trial or proceedings, or persist in failure 
  to conform to accepted rules and procedure, it would not be surprising if the 
  court or presiding judicial official should adjourn the hearing or, if he found 
  it necessary, order that the interrupting party be removed [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[25] These circumstances would be covered by the trial judge&#146;s power under 
  rule 52.06(4) to remove anyone from the courtroom who is interfering with the 
  proper conduct of the trial. The fact that a party is to be a witness is not 
  a ground to exclude them. See Pam v. Gale et al., [1950] 2 W.W.R. 802 (Man. 
  Q.B.) at 805 and Baywood at p. 235.</p>
<p>[26] In the criminal context, the rule that an accused is entitled to be present 
  throughout the trial is rigorously enforced. In R. v. Hertrich, Stewart and 
  Skinner (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510 (Ont. C.A.) at 537, Martin J.A. explained 
  the rationale for the rule in these terms:</p>
<p class="indent">The essential reason the accused is entitled to be present at his trial is 
  that he may hear the case made out against him and, having heard it, have the 
  opportunity of answering it: R. v. Lee Kun (1915), 11 Cr. App. R. 293. The right 
  of the accused to be present at his trial, however, also gives effect to another 
  principle. Fairness and openness are fundamental values in our criminal justice 
  system. The presence of the accused at all stages of his trial affords him the 
  opportunity of acquiring first-hand knowledge of the proceedings leading to 
  the eventual result of the trial. The denial of that opportunity to an accused 
  may well leave him with a justifiable sense of injustice. Indeed, in my view, 
  an examination of the Canadian decisions shows that the latter principle is, 
  in fact, the implicit and overriding principle underlying those decisions [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>[27] It seems to me that similar concerns apply in the civil context. Parties 
  have the right to be present, not only to hear the case put against them, but 
  as a matter of fairness and openness and to avoid &#147;a justifiable sense 
  of injustice&#148; because they were deprived of &#147;the opportunity of acquiring 
  first-hand knowledge of the proceedings leading to the eventual result of the 
  trial&#148;.</p>
<p>[28] The proper course in this case would have been for the trial judge to 
  have denied the plaintiff&#146;s application to exclude Ms. Chau. He might have 
  indicated that he could take into account that Ms. Chau was present during her 
  husband&#146;s testimony in assessing her evidence.</p>
<p>[29] While the tenants have therefore established that there was a breach of 
  the rule, this does not entitle them to a new trial. To succeed on this ground 
  of appeal and obtain a new trial the tenants must show that a substantial wrong 
  or miscarriage of justice was occasioned, pursuant to s. 134(6) of the Courts 
  of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, chap. C. 43. That provision is &#147;all-encompassing&#148; 
  and is broad enough to cover even a serious procedural error as occurred in 
  this case. See for example, Hrup v. Cipollone (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 715 (C.A.) 
  at 719. In Blajic v. Windsor Airline Limousine Service Ltd., [1995] O.J. No. 
  4045, this court dismissed an appeal where the trial judge had excluded the 
  party along with all the other witnesses.</p>
<p>[30] In this case, the tenants attempt to meet the burden of showing that a 
  substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was occasioned in two ways. They 
  submit that excluding Annie Chau was itself a substantial wrong or miscarriage 
  of justice and that the trial judge completely failed to deal with Ms. Chau&#146;s 
  testimony in his reasons. </p>
<p>[31] In my view, the tenants have not demonstrated that the appeal should be 
  allowed on this basis. Ms. Chau was present for all of the Estate&#146;s case 
  and therefore knew most of the case put against her and her husband. The same 
  counsel who was present throughout the proceedings represented her and her husband. 
  Their interests were in every sense identical. I do not agree with the submission 
  that the trial judge did not deal with Ms. Chau&#146;s evidence in his reasons. 
  On most occasions, he did lump her evidence in with that of her husband but 
  that was because it was identical to his on the critical points. While there 
  was a lengthier treatment of Mr. Chau&#146;s evidence, this was simply because 
  Mr. Chau had more evidence to give, having conducted most of the negotiations 
  with Dr. Liu, and because he, unlike Ms. Chau, was subject to a lengthy and 
  probing cross-examination on the circumstances of the July 28th meeting.</p>
<p>INADEQUACY OF REASONS AND MISAPPREHENSION OF EVIDENCE</p>
<p>[32] The tenants submit that the trial judge&#146;s reasons were inadequate, 
  that he misapprehended the evidence and relied upon inadmissible hearsay. I 
  will deal with the hearsay issue first. Some hearsay crept into the proceedings, 
  especially during the Estate&#146;s case during the testimony of Mrs. Liu. Counsel 
  for the tenants objected and the trial judge was aware of the problem. He also 
  noted that some of the hearsay related to matters that were not contentious. 
  In his reasons, the trial judge made reference to one hearsay statement that 
  was central to the case:</p>
<p class="indent">Edith Liu testified that she picked up copies of [the July 1, 1997] Offer to 
  Lease from the lawyer&#146;s office. She said that her husband gave the Offer 
  to Lease to the Chaus who would not agree to the lease terms and they never 
  returned the lease. She stated that her husband told her, &#147;They are month 
  to month tenants, there is no lease.&#148; [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>[33] This part of Mrs. Liu&#146;s evidence was not admissible for its truth. 
  It was, however, admissible for a limited purpose as part of the narrative of 
  the events. It also may explain some of Mrs. Liu&#146;s later conduct in her 
  dealings with the tenants. More problematic is that the trial judge returned 
  to this evidence when he came to deal with the central issue of the validity 
  of the July 28th Offer to Lease:</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Liu&#146;s wife and daughter have been unable to find the second original 
  of the July 28, 1997, Offer to Lease amongst Dr. Liu&#146;s papers. If Dr. Liu 
  received the second original document at the alleged meeting on July 28, 1997, 
  it is strange that it cannot be found because it would be the document which 
  governed the landlord and tenant relationship in a lease of eight years. It 
  is more likely, that because he did not agree with the changes and did not initial 
  the changes, he did not have in his possession the second original or a copy 
  of the July 28, 1997, Offer to Lease. This likelihood fits in with Dr. Liu&#146;s 
  report to his wife that the tenants do not have a lease and that they were month 
  to month tenants [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[34] However, the trial judge gave many reasons for disbelieving the evidence 
  of the tenants and I am not satisfied that this part of the trial judge&#146;s 
  reasons were important to his findings about the validity of the July 28th Offer 
  to Lease.</p>
<p>[35] The tenants submit that the trial judge&#146;s reasons are inadequate 
  in that he did not refer to all of the relevant evidence and failed to deal 
  with all of the issues in the case. The trial judge is under no obligation to 
  refer to all of the evidence in the case. His reasons are sufficient if they 
  address the contentious issues in the case and the evidence bearing on those 
  issues. The trial judge reviewed much of the evidence bearing on the central 
  issue, the validity of the July 28th lease. He gave a number of cogent reasons 
  for finding that the evidence of the tenants could not be accepted, such as 
  the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>According to the tenants, Dr. Liu went to the trouble of having a lawyer 
    prepare a typed version of the Offer to Lease because he could not read the 
    handwritten version presented by the tenants but then was content with the 
    July 28th version, which is heavily marked up;</li>
  <li>Dr. Liu had an Offer to Lease prepared that was for a five year term, having 
    obviously rejected the eight year term and eight year option offered by the 
    tenants in their handwritten offer, yet for no apparent reason reverted back 
    to the eight and eight term;</li>
  <li>Very minor changes to the lease were initialled by Dr. Liu but the most 
    important, the term of the lease and the option, were not; and</li>
  <li>Dr. Liu was 78 years of age when he presented the Offer to Lease and would 
    be 96 after the full run of the July 28th version.</li>
</ul>
<p>[36] The trial judge gave some other reasons, but these are sufficient to demonstrate 
  that he dealt with the issues at hand. In the end, the trial judge found that 
  the tenants&#146; version of events simply did not accord with common sense. 
</p>
<p>[37] The tenants submit that the trial judge misapprehended evidence and failed 
  to deal with other relevant evidence. In their factum, the tenants list ten 
  matters that they say the trial judge failed to consider or misapprehended. 
  I have reviewed all of them. In my view, they are actually referred to by the 
  trial judge or are inconsequential. I will provide some examples. The tenants 
  say that the trial judge failed to consider that Peter Chau approached Dr. Liu 
  with respect to renewal of the lease in May 1997 and provided a handwritten 
  Offer to Lease. In paragraph 6 of his reasons the trial judge specifically refers 
  to this evidence. The tenants say that the trial judge failed to consider their 
  evidence that the blank July 1st offer was presented at a meeting on July 28th 
  at which time changes were made and the offer was signed and red seals applied. 
  Of course, this is the tenants&#146; position. The trial judge reviewed at considerable 
  length the evidence bearing on this issue and found against them on that issue. 
  The tenants submit that the trial judge failed to take into account the unlikelihood 
  that the tenants would have renovated the premises if they were only month-to-month 
  tenants. However, this fails to take into account that the renovations were 
  made in 1996, during the previous lease. At that time, they had no reason to 
  believe they would be month-to-month tenants.</p>
<p>[38] The tenants also submit that the trial judge erroneously relied in part 
  on the fact that Mrs. Liu and her daughter were unable to find a copy of the 
  July 28th Offer to Lease. I have set out that part of his reasons above. The 
  trial judge found it strange that if that offer was valid and governed the relationship 
  between the parties that Dr. Liu would not have a copy. The tenants say that 
  the trial judge failed to take into account that Mrs. Liu could not find any 
  of the originals of the earlier leases. The evidence was somewhat confusing 
  on this issue. Mrs. Liu actually testified that she had many leases and thought 
  that she did have copies of the earlier leases. In the circumstances, the trial 
  judge was entitled to take into account that the current &#147;lease&#148; was 
  not amongst Dr. Liu&#146;s papers.</p>
<p>[39] I would make one final observation about the appeal. The trial judge found 
  against the tenants without resorting to s. 13 of the Evidence Act. I have considerable 
  doubt that there is any evidence that corroborates the tenants&#146; evidence 
  about the July 28th Offer to Lease. The only pieces of evidence to which the 
  tenants were able to point are a 1999 MLS listing that refers to the property 
  as income producing and a 2000 Agreement of Purchase and Sale signed by Mrs. 
  Liu that lists the existing tenants including the following:</p>
<p class="indent">1. The Basement Hair Salon is paying $2,000./month, including GST plus own 
  utilities.</p>
<p>[40] I do not see how this evidence confirms that there was a valid eight year 
  lease as opposed to a month-to-month tenancy. </p>
<p>[41] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>THE CROSS-APPEAL</p>
<p>[42] The trial judge dismissed the claim for arrears of rent, property and 
  business taxes because he found that Dr. Liu and the Estate had waived their 
  right to claim those arrears. The trial judge relied upon a course of conduct 
  in that Dr. Liu and then the Estate consistently accepted cheques for $2,000, 
  although the rent was greater, and made no demand for arrears. In Saskatchewan 
  River Bungalows Ltd. v. Maritime Assurance Co., [1994] 2 S.C.R. 490 at 500, 
  Major summarized the requirements of waiver as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">Waiver will be found only where the evidence demonstrates that the party waiving 
  had (1) a full knowledge of rights; and (2) an unequivocal and conscious intention 
  to abandon them. </p>
<p>[43] The Estate submits that there is no evidence to corroborate the evidence 
  of the tenants that Dr. Liu intended to waive arrears in rent and taxes and 
  therefore the trial judge erred in dismissing this part of the claim. The Estate 
  relies upon s. 13 of the Evidence Act, which I have referred to earlier. For 
  convenience, the full text of the section is set out here:</p>
<p class="indent">13. In an action by or against the heirs, next of kin, executors, administrators 
  or assigns of a deceased person, an opposite or interested party shall not obtain 
  a verdict, judgment or decision on his or her own evidence in respect of any 
  matter occurring before the death of the deceased person, unless such evidence 
  is corroborated by some other material evidence.</p>
<p>[44] In my view, there was evidence to support the trial judge&#146;s finding 
  of waiver as applied to the rent. There was not just the tenants&#146; evidence 
  that Dr. Liu had agreed to accept $2,000. There was a course of conduct extending 
  over many years in which Dr. Liu accepted the $2,000 cheques, notwithstanding 
  that from 1995, the 1991 lease called for increasingly greater amounts of rent. 
  This course of conduct continued until Dr. Liu&#146;s death in 1999 and thereafter 
  until the application was served in 2001. It is also confirmed to some extent 
  by the Agreement of Purchase and Sale previously referred to signed by Mrs. 
  Liu and which indicated that the tenants were paying &#147;$2000/month, including 
  GST, plus own utilities&#148;. In my view, this was sufficient evidence to corroborate 
  the tenants&#146; evidence with respect to arrears of rent.</p>
<p>[45] I have greater difficulty with the property and business tax arrears. 
  The tenants testified that they paid the property taxes in cash to Dr. Liu. 
  They do not claim that he waived those arrears. There is no evidence to corroborate 
  the tenants&#146; evidence on this point. In my view, applying s. 13, the Estate 
  is entitled to succeed on this part of the claim.</p>
<p>[46] With respect to the business tax arrears, in my view there is no evidence 
  of waiver. The tenants testified that Dr. Liu agreed to forgive the first $10,000 
  of the business tax taking into account the renovations that the tenants made 
  in 1996. This is the only evidence that Dr. Liu agreed to waive these taxes. 
  However, the trial judge did not accept this part of the tenants&#146; evidence:</p>
<p class="indent">I have difficulty accepting that these discussion took place. 
  The renovations had been completed and paid for by the Chaus more than a year 
  prior to the alleged meeting of July 28, 1997. There is no evidence that there 
  was any discussion with Dr. Liu prior to July 28, 1997 that he should share 
  in the payment of the renovations. The Offer to Lease in force at the time the 
  renovations were done clearly stated that any alterations were to be done at 
  the tenants&#146; expense.</p>
<p class="indent">I find it interesting that Mr. Chau would have, at the alleged 
  meeting of July 28, 1997, a copy of the renovation invoice from April 1996 in 
  his possession. I also find it difficult to accept that Dr. Liu, over a year 
  after the renovations were completed, would be willing to pay $10,000 when most 
  of the leasehold improvements were for the benefit of the tenants.</p>
<p class="indent">If these matters were discussed they are important changes to 
  the July 28, 1997, Offer to Lease. Considering the myriad of changes made to 
  that document I find it odd that these additional changes were not made on the 
  document.</p>
<p>[47] Without the tenants&#146; testimony, there is no evidence capable of amounting 
  to waiver as defined in Saskatchewan River Bungalows Ltd. Merely because neither 
  Dr. Liu nor the Estate made any demand until 2001 is not, in my view, capable 
  of amounting to proof of waiver in the sense of &#147;(1) a full knowledge of 
  rights; and (2) an unequivocal and conscious intention to abandon them&#148;. 
  Finally, there is no evidence to corroborate the tenants&#146; evidence on this 
  point within the meaning of s. 13. Accordingly, the Estate is also entitled 
  to succeed on this part of the claim.</p>
<p>DISPOSITION</p>
<p>[48] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal in 
  part as indicated. The Estate is entitled to its costs of the appeal and the 
  cross-appeal, which I would fix at $10,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> Apparently because the bank kept making 
  mistakes with the $2,000.90 cheques, the tenants and Dr. Liu agreed that the 
  tenants only had to pay $2,000.</p>
