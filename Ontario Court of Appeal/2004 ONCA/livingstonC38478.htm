<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Maple Engineering &amp; Construction Ltd. appeals from the judgment of 
  Wallace J. dated May 28, 2002 ordering Maple to pay damages for breach of contract 
  to Livingston Excavating and Trucking Inc. in the amount of $52,550.</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge found that the parties had entered into a contract pursuant 
  to which Maple agreed to rent Livingston's 892E John Deere long-reach excavator 
  at the rate of $140 per hour for the duration of Maple's job for the barge dredging 
  of Hamilton Harbour at the site of the construction of a new pier. Maple replaced 
  Livingston with another sub-constructor, Tri City Equipment, a few days after 
  the contract commenced, based on a better rate. The trial judge's finding of 
  liability is not appealed. The appellant raises several grounds of appeal with 
  respect to the issues of damages, however.</p>
<p>[3] The main point raised is that the trial judge committed reversible error 
  in determining that Livingston would have spent 1000 hours in performance of 
  the contract.</p>
<p>[4] This finding was made partly - but only partly - on the basis of Tri-City 
  time cards that were examined by Livingston's expert, Mr. Bertoia, and that 
  show 141 days of work totalling 1254 hours. The appellant argues that the time 
  cards were not in evidence and that Mr. Bertoia's opinion is of no force because 
  its factual underpinnings are not proven.</p>
<p>[5] Whether the time cards themselves were in evidence, however, there was 
  ample evidence from which the trial judge could infer and find, as she did, 
  that Livingston would have spent 1000 hours on the job. Not the least of this 
  evidence was the acknowledgement by Maple's principal, Mr. Vaillantcourt, in 
  cross-examination, that &quot;Tri-City excavation crews were on the site on 
  each and every one of the days that are contained in the schedule to Mr. Bertoia's 
  report that lists or attempts to list the number of hours that were worked by 
  the Tri-City employees&quot;. That schedule showed 141 days and 1254 hours. 
  There was therefore an evidentiary basis upon which the trial judge could draw 
  the inference that the parties were in effect in agreement as to the number 
  of days Tri-City spent on site and the number of hours worked. Taken together 
  with the other factors referred to at paras. 44-46 of her reasons, there was 
  ample support for the trial judge's finding that Livingston would have worked 
  1000 hours on the project. There being no palpable or overriding error on her 
  part, there is no basis for this court to interfere.</p>
<p>[6] The appellant also argued that the trial judge erred with respect to the 
  contingencies she took into account, mitigation, the failure to take into account 
  overtime and holiday pay deductions called for under the Employment Standards 
  Act and, an allowance for extras. We see no error on the part of the trial judge 
  in her disposition of these issues.</p>
<p>[7] The appellant further argued that the trial judge erred in failing to credit 
  Maple with a payment of $2,990 made to Livingston for certain preparation that 
  it had done in relation to the contract. In our view, the trial judge did err 
  in this regard. Those costs would have been included in Livingston's total cost 
  of the contract, had it been carried through, and are already properly reflected 
  in the trial judge's award of damages. It was not a collateral contract. The 
  judgment will therefore be varied downward by $2,990.</p>
<p>[8] Finally, counsel agree that the trial judge made a minor arithmetical error 
  of $750 in arriving at the sum of $52,550. The amount, based on her calculation 
  should have been $51,800.</p>
<p>[9] The judgment is therefore varied downward to $48,810. The appeal is otherwise 
  dismissed.</p>
<p>[10] The respondent is entitled to its costs fixed at $12,000 all inclusive.
