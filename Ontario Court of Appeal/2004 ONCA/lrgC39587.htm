<p>On appeal from conviction by Justice John R. R. Jennings of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, sitting without a jury, on December 5, 2002.</p>
<p>FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant was convicted by the trial judge of the offences of sexual 
  interference with S.M., a girl under the age of fourteen years, and of sexual 
  assault of S.M. The events complained of were alleged to have taken place when 
  the complainant was between the ages of five and one-half and twelve years old. 
  She was fourteen when the complaint was made to the authorities and seventeen 
  at the time of the trial. The events were alleged to have occurred between 1991 
  and 1997. The appellant testified and denied the allegations. The trial judge 
  rejected the evidence of the appellant based on demeanor and on a factor not 
  borne out by the evidence. In my view, the trial judge erred in his approach 
  to the evidence of the appellant. For that reason, I would set aside the conviction 
  and order a new trial.</p>
<p>
  EVIDENCE</p>
<p>
  [2] S.M. and G.M. are twin sisters. Their parents separated when they were five 
  or six years old. Because the twins' father often worked the night shift, on 
  some weekends when he had access visits with them, he left the girls overnight 
  with the appellant who was the father's best friend. The appellant moved three 
  times during the relevant period, but in each apartment he had one bedroom and 
  a living room. He would have the girls sleep in his bed in the bedroom and he 
  would sleep on the couch in the living room.</p>
<p>
  [3] The girls enjoyed their visits with the appellant who played games with 
  them and bought them treats and gifts.</p>
<p>
  [4] S.M. testified that her sister was afraid of the dark and would call out 
  to the appellant to come and sleep with them and to comfort them until they 
  fell asleep. G.M. slept against the wall while S.M. slept on the outside. S.M. 
  said that when her sister called, the appellant would get into the bed clothed 
  and put his arm around S.M. G.M. would quickly fall asleep. The appellant began 
  putting his right hand under S.M.'s clothing, touching her chest and stomach 
  then inside her pants touching her vagina. Eventually he began to put his finger 
  into her vagina. The first time he did that he asked her if it hurt. She did 
  not respond and he never asked again. After that, on the sleepover visits he 
  always fondled her vagina and chest but did not always insert his finger into 
  her vagina. They never spoke about what was going on. Nor did her sister know 
  about it when it was happening.</p>
<p>
  [5] Eventually S.M. became aware that what the appellant was doing to her was 
  wrong and she did not want to sleep over although her sister did. Ultimately 
  she told her sister what was happening. Her sister became very upset and they 
  agreed not to tell anyone because they were concerned that if their father found 
  out, he would harm the appellant and their father would go to jail, and they 
  did not want that to happen. Their father did not testify at the trial.</p>
<p>
  [6] Shortly after disclosing to her sister, S.M. was at her uncle Bob's house 
  visiting when her step-cousin, a girl one and one-half years older, told S.M. 
  that she had been improperly touched. S.M. responded that she had been as well. 
  A few days later, her uncle Bob questioned her and she begged him not to tell 
  her father. Some time after that the issue of improper touching was discussed 
  at school and, as a result, S.M. disclosed the allegations to the guidance counsellor 
  who called the police.</p>
<p>
  [7] G.M. remembered staying at the appellant's apartment approximately once 
  a month until the girls were about ten years old. She confirmed how much the 
  girls enjoyed going to the appellant's place and how kind he was to them. She 
  recalled sleeping against the wall in the appellant's bed, with her sister on 
  the outside, while the appellant slept on the couch. Importantly, while she 
  confirmed that she was very afraid of the dark as a child, she did not remember 
  calling out for the appellant at night. She said that about two or three times 
  a year she would wake up and the appellant would be in the bed. Once or twice 
  when she woke up the appellant had his arm around S.M. She also said sometimes 
  she would wake up and S.M. would be crying.</p>
<p>
  [8] The girls' uncle Bob testified, essentially confirming his role in the events.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant was forty-two years old at the time of the trial in 2002. 
  He had been in a relationship with his current partner since 1994 and has two 
  children from that relationship. He said that the girls did sleep over at his 
  apartment between 1991 and 1995, with only one visit after he began his relationship 
  with his partner. He said there were about ten visits in total, while the girls 
  had the number up around fifty visits. He said that the girls slept in his bed, 
  while he slept on the sofa. He could not recall where they slept on the bed. 
  He said that he did not put them to bed, or check on them during the night. 
  The only time he would go into the room was if he needed to get something. He 
  said that the girls did not wake in the night and he never heard S.M. cry. He 
  denied ever touching S.M. inappropriately.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant's partner testified that the girls did sleep over one time 
  after January 1995, and that in subsequent conversations with them, they asked 
  if they could come and stay again.</p>
<p>
  [11] At trial the Crown's position was that the complainant was credible and 
  that her evidence was supported by her sister and uncle. The defence raised 
  four issues: (1) the inconsistencies in S.M.'s evidence made it unreliable; 
  (2) there was a strong suggestion that S.M. invented her story in response to 
  her step-cousin's account of being inappropriately touched; (3) there was a 
  strong possibility of collusion between the two sisters; and (4) the denial 
  by the appellant at least raised a reasonable doubt, the benefit of which must 
  be extended to him.</p>
<p>
  [12] The trial judge dealt with each of these submissions made by the defence. 
  Because I would order a new trial, I do not propose to deal with the first three 
  issues.</p>
<p>
  [13] In respect of the fourth issue, the trial judge gave the following reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Mr. L seemed flat and unconvincing in the witness box, but the demeanor of a 
  witness is not always of particular assistance as an indicia of truthfulness. 
  What did astound me about his testimony, however, was that over all the years 
  when he was baby-sitting these two young girls, as a favour to his best friend, 
  the girls with whom he regularly played, and to whom he often gave elaborate 
  presents, and to whom he usually gave treats, during that period of time he 
  never once assisted them in preparing for bed; he never once tucked them into 
  bed; he never once checked on them during the night; he never once heard them 
  cry; he never once saw them awaken during the night; and he never once looked 
  in on them, to see if they had. That is simply beyond belief, particularly in 
  a person who was otherwise so caring of them during the daylight hours. I am 
  driven to the unhappy conclusion that I cannot accept Mr. L's evidence on that 
  point, and it follows that I cannot accept his denial about touching. I simply 
  do not believe him. Nor does his evidence raise a reasonable doubt in my mind 
  as to whether it might be true. That being the case, Mr. L will be convicted 
  on both counts. </p>
<p>
  [14] It appears from these reasons that the trial judge found the appellant 
  incredible based on his demeanor, but rightly acknowledged that he could not 
  base a finding that the testimony of an accused did not raise a reasonable doubt 
  on demeanor alone. He therefore looked for other indicia of the appellant's 
  veracity or lack thereof. He found that the appellant was not believable when 
  he said that he never helped the girls get ready for bed, tucked them in, or 
  checked on them during the night. He concluded that in the context of the warm 
  and caring relationship he had with them, it was incongruent that he would not 
  put them to bed or check on them at night.</p>
<p>
  [15] However, the girls' testimony, to the extent that they were asked about 
  any of these issues, was consistent with that of the appellant. S.M. said that 
  she never bathed or showered at the appellant's home and the appellant testified 
  that he never bathed the girls. G.M. testified that the appellant was not in 
  the room when they went to bed nor did he lie with them to put them to sleep, 
  or come in during the night when S.M. wet the bed. S.M. said the appellant never 
  undressed them except during the alleged incidents. S.M. described in cross-examination 
  the bedtime routine as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"><span class="indent"> Q. Right, okay. And the way these events 
  transpire is your sister and you go to bed - -</span></p>
<p class="indent"> A. That's right.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. - - together?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Uh-huh.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. You're both awake and you change into your night clothes 
  and go to sleep; right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. That's right.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And your sister always sleeps against the wall?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. The side of the bed. Yeah, against the wall.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And you always sleep in the middle of the bed?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. That's right.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Okay. And your sister, always within a few minutes - - you 
  know, tell me if I've got it wrong or right, five minutes within getting into 
  the bed - -</p>
<p class="indent"> A. But she would call for Roy first.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. - - calls out for Roy?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yeah.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Okay. So right within minutes, each and every time she goes 
  "Roy, would you come in here. I'm scared"; right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yeah. He used to put us to bed late though, because, I mean, 
  we were little and he was playing with us, so she would be tired. Right away 
  she'd go to sleep.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. But she'd always call for Roy?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. That's right.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Okay. The minute she got to bed, whether it was late or 
  not, she would call for [R.L.]; right?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And in response to her call, he would always come in and 
  lay down on the bed?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. That's right.</p>
<p>
  [16] In other words, there was no contradiction by the girls of the evidence 
  that the appellant did not help them get ready for bed, tuck them in, or check 
  on them in the night. Furthermore, although this evidence was elicited from 
  the appellant in cross-examination, Crown counsel did not put the same set of 
  questions to S.M. and G.M. As a result, there is no basis for a full comparison 
  of their accounts. Yet the trial judge viewed this conduct of the appellant 
  as determinative, along with his demeanor, of lack of credibility.</p>
<p>
  [17] An important disagreement in the evidence was on the issue of whether the 
  appellant came into the girls' bed in response to calls from G.M. that she was 
  afraid. On that issue G.M. said that she was afraid of the dark but she did 
  not recall calling the appellant into their room. Her only recollection was 
  sometimes waking and finding him in the bed. S.M. said that her sister would 
  call the appellant into their room every time they were there, that he would 
  come and then her sister would soon fall asleep. Besides the significant discrepancy 
  between the sisters' testimony on this critical issue, neither contradicted 
  the appellant on the issue on which the trial judge focused and that caused 
  him to disbelieve the appellant and wholly reject his evidence.</p>
<p>
  [18] In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge quite properly noted the difficulty 
  for a person accused of an historical sexual assault on a very young person, 
  to raise a defence other than a simple denial. He referred to the obligation 
  of a trial judge in those circumstances to be "extra-vigilant" when 
  examining the evidence of the complainant. In this case there were changes and 
  discrepancies in the evidence of the complainant, which the trial judge discounted, 
  as he was entitled to do, in assessing her evidence. </p>
<p>
  [19] He then considered whether the evidence of the accused wholly denying the 
  allegations and explaining the circumstances, raised a reasonable doubt in the 
  context of those discrepancies. In that assessment, the trial judge erred by 
  rejecting the evidence of the appellant on the basis of demeanor, combined with 
  an apparent misapprehension of the evidence based on his concern over the actions 
  of the accused at the girls' bedtime, when those actions were not contradicted 
  by the evidence of the complainant and her sister on the specific points. See 
  e.g., R. v. C. (J.) (2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 197 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Horton (1999), 
  133 C.C.C. (3d) 340 (B.C. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [20] Because of this error on the critical issue of reasonable doubt, I would 
  set aside the conviction and order a new trial.</p>

<p>
  WEILER J.A. (Dissenting): </p>
<p>
  [21] I have read the reasons of Feldman J.A. and I respectfully disagree with 
  her conclusion that this appeal must be allowed on the basis that the trial 
  judge erred in rejecting the appellant's evidence on the basis of his demeanour 
  and a factor not borne out by the evidence. </p>
<p>
  [22] Any intervention in findings of fact of a trial judge based on credibility 
  requires proof of a "palpable and overriding error": Lensen v. Lensen, 
  [1987] 2 S.C.R. 672; Giffen v. Goodman Estate, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 353; and this 
  standard also applies to any inferences available to a trial judge: Housen v. 
  Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235. The comments of Iacobucci and Major JJ. at 
  paras. 22 and 24 of Housen v. Nikolaisen are apposite to the issues raised on 
  this appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> [T]rial courts are in an advantageous position when it comes 
  to assessing and weighing vast quantities of evidence. In making a factual inference, 
  the trial judge must sift though the relevant facts, decide on their weight, 
  and draw a factual conclusion. Thus, where evidence exists which supports this 
  conclusion, interference with this conclusion entails interference with the 
  weight assigned by the trial judge to the pieces of evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">. . . </p>
<p class="indent">[A]lthough the same high standard of deference applies to the 
  entire range of factual determinations made by the trial judge, where a factual 
  finding is grounded in an assessment of credibility of a witness, the overwhelming 
  advantage of the trial judge in this area must be acknowledged.</p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge's rejection of the appellant's evidence came towards the 
  end of his five pages of reasons during which he charged himself that he had 
  to be extra-vigilant in examining the following: the evidence of the complainant; 
  his review of the evidence of the complainant; the evidence of G.M.; the evidence 
  of S.M.'s uncle Bob concerning S.M.'s disclosure to him; the evidence of the 
  appellant and C.C.; the evidence of the appellant's partner regarding the end 
  of the time period when he babysat the girls; the position of the defence; his 
  analysis and assessment of S.M.'s evidence; certain inconsistencies in the evidence; 
  his analysis of G.M.'s evidence; and his rejection of the defence position that 
  S.M. had fabricated her evidence or colluded with G.M. At this stage the trial 
  judge had found S.M.'s evidence was credible on the core issue of whether she 
  was touched and he had accepted G.M.'s evidence as truthful. </p>
<p>
  [24] G.M.'s evidence was that she awoke on some occasions to find the appellant, 
  apparently asleep in bed, with his arm around S.M. while S.M. was crying. G.M. 
  also testified S.M. became increasingly reluctant to stay overnight at the appellant's. 
  In contrast, the appellant's evidence was a denial that he had ever inappropriately 
  touched S.M. In accepting the girls' evidence, the trial judge implicitly rejected 
  the evidence of the appellant as the two could not stand together. Although 
  the trial judge considered the demeanour of the appellant to be "flat and 
  unconvincing" he immediately observed that "&#133;the demeanor of 
  a witness is not always of particular assistance as an indicia of truthfulness." 
  It was at this point that the trial judge considered the appellant's evidence 
  that he had never checked on S.M. and G.M. while they were in bed and concluded 
  that he disbelieved him on this point. He further rejected the appellant's denial 
  that he had sexually touched S.M. and held it did not raise a reasonable doubt 
  in his mind. Read in their entirety, the trial judge's reasons indicate that 
  his rejection of the appellant's evidence was based on his assessment of the 
  evidence as a whole. As my colleague Laskin J.A. said in R. v. Nichols (2001), 
  46 O.R. (5th) 294 (Ont. C.A.): </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he Supreme Court of Canada and this court have consistently stated that a 
  trial judge's reasons should not be put under a microscope, that individual 
  paragraphs should not be examined in isolation from the reasons as a whole, 
  and that trial judges are presumed to know elementary principles of criminal 
  law...</p>
<p>
  See also R. v. Morrisey (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.)</p>
<p>
  [25] The central issue in this case was whether the appellant had ever inappropriately 
  touched S.M. while she lay in bed with her sister. The questions concerning 
  whether the appellant ever checked on S.M. and G.M. when they were in bed arose 
  in cross?examination in the context of the appellant's denial that he did not 
  know that S.M. always slept on the outside of the bed and that G.M. slept on 
  the inside of the bed next to the wall. In maintaining this position, the appellant 
  denied that he had ever helped the girls get ready for bed, tucked them in, 
  or checked on them after they were in bed. The appellant eventually acknowledged 
  in cross-examination that he may have gone into the bedroom when the girls were 
  asleep to get something for himself, "but not to check on them". Given 
  the appellant's admission that he may have gone into the bedroom when the girls 
  were asleep, the significance of his denial that he had never helped them get 
  ready for bed or heard them call out and respond was diminished. </p>
<p>
  [26] Feldman J.A. concludes that there was no contradiction between the evidence 
  of the appellant on the one hand and that of the complainant, S.M., and her 
  twin sister, G.M., on the other, regarding whether the appellant did not help 
  them get ready for bed, tuck them in, or check on them in the night. As a result, 
  she holds that the trial judge was not entitled to disbelieve the appellant 
  when he said he never once saw the complainant and her sister awaken during 
  the night, and never once looked in on them to see if they had, and that this 
  amounted to a material misapprehension of the evidence leading the trial judge 
  to decide the case on a factor not borne out by the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [27] With respect, I do not read the evidence in this manner. S.M. testified 
  in her evidence in chief that when she and G.M. slept over at the appellant's 
  apartment, "At first he would put us to bed, and it would be me and my 
  sister." Thus, the evidence of S.M. directly contradicted the evidence 
  of the appellant that he never helped them get ready for bed or tuck them in. 
  </p>
<p>
  [28] I also respectfully disagree with my colleague that the import of the evidence 
  of the appellant, S.M. and G.M. is that the appellant never checked on them 
  after they were in bed. G.M. testified that she and S.M. were afraid of the 
  dark and that sometimes her sister would cry in the middle of the night. S.M. 
  had dreams of clowns and was very afraid of them. S.M. would have a bad dream 
  and wake up and cry. G.M. also testified that both she and her sister were afraid 
  of spiders. On one occasion after they were in bed G.M. saw a large black spider, 
  called to the appellant to come and remove it and he did so. </p>
<p>
  [29] S.M. testified that G.M. would call out to the appellant because she was 
  afraid of the dark and tell him she was scared and ask him to come into the 
  bed to sleep with them until they fell asleep. He would come in and lay with 
  his arm over S.M. G.M. testified that she did not recall calling for help when 
  she was scared and asking the appellant to get into bed with them. Feldman J.A. 
  is of the opinion that this is an important contradiction between the evidence 
  of S.M. and G.M. G.M. did, however, testify, "sometimes Roy would let us 
  keep the hall light on if I was freaking out. Like, if I was telling him, 'I'm 
  scared, I'm scared,' he would let me keep the hall light on" [emphasis 
  added]. Significantly, G.M. also testified that sometimes she would wake up 
  and find the appellant in bed with them while S.M. was crying. The evidence 
  from both girls is that G.M. called out to the appellant because she was afraid 
  of the dark and the appellant heard her and responded. Thus, both S.M. and G.M. 
  testified that after they were in bed they had typical childhood fears that 
  led the appellant to "check" on them although they did not use this 
  term. </p>
<p>
  [30] The appellant admitted that the complainant and her sister slept at his 
  apartment intermittently over a period of five to six years while their father 
  worked the night shift at Weston bakery and that at the time they started sleeping 
  over they were about five years old. The appellant played games with the girls, 
  set up obstacle courses for them in the park, bought them treats, cool kids' 
  cereals, necklaces and charms for their necklaces, and rings, until they were 
  around 11 years old. S.M. testified that the appellant also paid to have her 
  ears pierced, bought her earrings, and bought her a ring with a diamond chip 
  in it for her tenth birthday.</p>
<p>
  [31] In his closing submissions, the Crown submitted that the appellant's denial 
  that he ever checked on the girls should be rejected. As part of his submissions 
  on this point he stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  So even when he [the appellant] says, "Well, I might have gone into the 
  room, but I wouldn't have had anything to do with the children. Even if I did 
  go into the room, I wouldn't check that they're okay, would[n't] look at them, 
  literally wouldn't look at them' and that I suggest is very strong evidence 
  of why you should-- a strong indication of why you should reject his evidence. 
  It is simply incredible that a man who is, by even the children's reckoning, 
  somewhat focused on kids is paying so little attention is just simply incredulous--incredible, 
  rather.</p>
<p>
  [32] The trial judge agreed. Considering the length of time over which the appellant 
  babysat the girls, their ages at the time, and the relationship that the appellant 
  had with them, and considering also the trial judge's assessment of the evidence 
  of S.M. and G.M., he was entitled to reject the appellant's evidence that he 
  had never heard the girls cry or awaken during the night, that he had never 
  checked on them, and to disbelieve the appellant that if he went into the room 
  he would not have even looked at the girls lying in bed. See R. v. K.A. (1999), 
  137 C.C.C. (3d) 554 at para. 42 (Ont. C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [33] I must now deal with the other grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant. 
  They are, briefly, that S.M. fabricated her evidence and colluded with her sister; 
  and that the trial judge failed to consider the totality of the inconsistencies 
  in assessing whether S.M.'s evidence was reliable.</p>
<p>
  [34] The position of the defence was that the complainant fabricated her evidence 
  as a result of her cousin disclosing that she had been sexually abused by touching. 
  The complainant testified that she had previously told her sister about the 
  abuse. She said the disclosure took place at the house in Oshawa when they were 
  discussing going over to the appellant's to sleep. Her sister G.M. testified 
  that the disclosure took place at her mother's house in Etobicoke, that they 
  were talking about a police officer who had come to the school and talked about 
  good touching and bad touching, and then the complainant made disclosure. There 
  was also inconsistency in the evidence as to G.M.'s reaction to S.M.'s disclosure, 
  but both agreed that G.M. told S.M. not to tell anyone. The trial judge found 
  these inconsistencies to be collateral matters that did not affect the integrity 
  of S.M.'s evidence as to what happened to her. He also observed that S.M.'s 
  evidence as to what happened to her differed significantly in detail from that 
  of her cousin's. It was open to the trial judge to come to the conclusion that, 
  despite these inconsistencies, S.M. had not fabricated her evidence. </p>
<p>
  [35] The appellant also submits that the trial judge failed to appreciate the 
  fact that the complainant's sister tailored her evidence as to the number of 
  times they stayed over at the appellant's place and that this supported the 
  defence position of collusion. S.M. testified that she slept over at the appellant's 
  apartment periodically when she was in the care of her father and that the number 
  of times this happened was at least 20. When asked whether it could have been 
  40 or 50 times she said it was not that many. At another point in her evidence 
  S.M. stated that she couldn't say how many times she had slept over, whether 
  it was 20, 30 or 40 but she knew it was more than 10. G.M. testified at the 
  preliminary inquiry that they slept over at the appellant's a few times. At 
  trial she said that they slept over around 50 times. The appellant submits that 
  G.M. shifted her evidence from the preliminary inquiry to the trial to accord 
  more closely with that of her sister. The appellant testified that they slept 
  over two or three times at his apartment on Manderluy, Morse, O'Connor, Cosburn 
  and once after he moved to Chisholm Street. The trial judge found that the number 
  of times the girls slept at the appellant's apartment was less than estimated 
  by S.M. and certainly less than suggested by G.M. Having regard to the fact 
  there was a large discrepancy in the evidence of S.M. and G.M. at trial as to 
  the number of times they had slept over at the appellant's apartment, the appellant's 
  submission concerning collusion on this point does not appear to be borne out. 
  Further, the trial judge is in the best position to determine whether these 
  discrepancies are material. </p>
<p>
  [36] In his reasons, the trial judge set out the defence position that G.M. 
  had colluded with S.M. in giving her evidence. At a later point in his reasons, 
  the trial judge stated that, "[T]here was nothing about her [G.M.'s] evidence 
  to suggest prior discussion with her sister. The minor inconsistencies in their 
  respective testimonies are precisely what one would expect to find in the testimony 
  of two persons trying to recall the same incidents on their own and without 
  collusion between them." </p>
<p>
  [37] If the trial judge's statement is taken as a statement relating to the 
  entire proceeding it is incorrect. The complainant acknowledged that she and 
  her sister discussed the allegations on several occasions until the preliminary 
  inquiry when they were told they were not allowed to do so as they were both 
  witnesses. If, however, the trial judge's statement is taken as a reference 
  to the trial evidence he had just heard, it would have been open to him to make 
  this statement. In any event, collusion connotes more than the fact that two 
  witnesses have discussed their evidence; it connotes an understanding to work 
  together to subvert the appellant's right to a fair trial. Collusion can also 
  occur innocently, such as when an unintentional infection results from discussing 
  the case with another witness or a third party: John Sopinka, Sidney N. Lederman 
  &amp; Alan W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2d ed. (Markham: Butterworths, 
  1999) at 587. However, as explained by Alan W. Mewett &amp; Peter J. Sankoff, 
  Witnesses, looseleaf (Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2004) at 6-41: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Witnesses in criminal proceedings will often know each other and it is inevitable 
  that discussion of the case at hand will occur in some situations. It is unreasonable 
  to suggest, however, that such discussion [prior to trial and the judge's warning] 
  should automatically give rise to a presumption of frailty in the witnesses' 
  evidence.</p>
<p>
  See also R. v. McMath (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 174 (B.C.C.A.). The trial judge 
  was entitled to reject the defence theory of collusion after having carefully 
  considered and referred to the inconsistencies in the evidence of S.M. and G.M. 
  </p>
<p>
  [38] The appellant's other main ground of appeal relates to the manner in which 
  the trial judge dealt with inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence. The 
  appellant submits that, cumulatively, inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence 
  merited serious consideration by the trial judge, that he failed to consider 
  the totality of the inconsistencies in assessing whether the complaint's evidence 
  was reliable, and in so doing fell into error. See R. v. S.(W.) (1994), 90 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 242 (Ont. C.A.). I will refer to the two principal alleged inconsistencies 
  as the bedtime scenario and the ice cream scenario. The bedroom scenario refers 
  to the inconsistency in the evidence of S.M. and G.M. concerning whether G.M. 
  called the appellant to lie on the bed with them because she was afraid of the 
  dark. G.M. did not recall asking why the appellant came to lie on the bed with 
  them but she confirmed S.M.'s evidence that the appellant lay on the bed with 
  them and the manner in which he did so, with one arm over S.M. As I have indicated, 
  G.M.'s inability to recall why the appellant lay on the bed with them is not 
  a basis for overturning the trial judge's finding that S.M.'s evidence was credible. 
  </p>
<p>
  [39] The other major inconsistency alleged is the ice cream incident. At trial, 
  S.M. testified that the appellant used the offer to buy ice cream as a bribe 
  to get her to agree to letting him teach her how to French kiss. In her evidence 
  at the preliminary inquiry, S.M. said that she and her sister had ice cream 
  together before they went to bed and that the French kissing incident happened 
  after. The complainant associated the incident of French kissing with the consumption 
  of ice cream in both cases. The complainant also associated the French kiss 
  in both instances with the appellant having had a disagreement with Faith, his 
  acknowledged girlfriend at the time. The trial judge was entitled to conclude 
  that any inconsistency as to when the ice cream was eaten was not material.</p>
<p>
  [40] The trial judge's reasons indicate that he was alive to the defence position 
  that the case for the Crown had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The 
  trial judge was in the best position to make assessments as to the credibility 
  and reliability of the witnesses and we are required to give due deference to 
  that position. I do not read his reasons as indicating he committed a material 
  misapprehension of the evidence nor do I read them as revealing any palpable 
  and overriding error with respect to his findings of fact. I would dismiss the 
  appeal as to conviction. </p>
<p>
  [41] With respect to the sentence appeal, the appellant submits that the trial 
  judge erred in not imposing a conditional sentence. He stresses that beyond 
  the inherent violence associated with the offence there was no gratuitous violence. 
  The abuse ceased prior to disclosure by the complainant. The appellant is now 
  in a stable relationship and has two young children. </p>
<p>
  [42] In R. v. Cromien (2002), 155 O.A.C. 128 (C.A.) this court stated that a 
  conditional sentence should rarely be imposed having regard to the violation 
  of trust in cases of this nature. This is not one of those rare cases. While 
  I would grant leave to appeal sentence, I would dismiss the appeal as to sentence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [43] In the result, I would dismiss the appeal as to conviction and sentence.</p>
