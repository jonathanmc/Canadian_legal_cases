<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] At the opening of the appeal, counsel for the appellant abandoned the argument 
  with respect to the notional tax on the sale of the Biovail stock.</p>
<p>[2] With respect to the camp and day care expenses, it was open on the evidence 
  for the trial judge to find, as she did, that the appellant did not discuss 
  those expenses with the respondent and did not intend to do so. In light of 
  that finding, we see no error in the trial judge's conclusion that the respondent 
  should not have to bear a portion of those expenses.</p>
<p>[3] With respect to the tax shelter, the trial judge found that the appellant 
  had not proven on a balance of probabilities that his liability under the tax 
  shelters exceeded their asset value. Given that there was evidence that the 
  shelters may yield profits greater than the promissory notes, that the shelters 
  were yielding some interest and must therefore have had some asset value, that 
  some tax write-off value remained post-separation, that there is some time value 
  of money and that the tax position of the appellant some five years after the 
  valuation date could affect this issue, we find that the conclusion she reached 
  was entirely open to her on this record. </p>
<p>[4] With respect to the payment of the December 2000 income tax instalment, 
  it roughly corresponded to the portion of the year following the valuation date 
  and the trial judge properly excluded it as a debt owing on the valuation date.</p>
<p>[5] With respect to the mortgage overpayments, the amounts claimed were all 
  paid following the valuation date, they were not pleaded and, as the trial judge 
  found, there is no legal basis on which to order their reimbursement.</p>
<p>[6] With respect to the costs awarded to the respondent, this was a matter 
  within the discretion of the trial judge. She gave reasons for making the award 
  she did, and those reasons reflect no palpable and overriding error so as to 
  warrant appellate intervention. </p>
<p>[7] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs. </p>
<p>[8] Having regard to the fact that we called on counsel for the respondent 
  with respect to only one issue, and to the respondent's offer to settle this 
  appeal (of which we were advised by counsel and which we have taken into account, 
  although not in the Rule 49 sense), we fix the respondent's costs in the sum 
  of $13,479.20, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
