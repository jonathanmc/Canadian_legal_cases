<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal pursuant to s. 784(1) of the Criminal Code against the 
  dismissal of the appellant's application for relief by way of certiorari to 
  quash an order that he stand trial on a charge of first degree murder.</p>
<p>
  [2] The preliminary hearing judge concluded that there was evidence that the 
  appellant caused the death of the victim while committing, or attempting to 
  commit, a sexual assault, namely, anal intercourse, and on that basis, he ordered 
  the appellant to stand trial on first degree murder pursuant to s. 231(5)(b) 
  of the Code. </p>
<p>
  [3] As for the Crown's alternative position for committal on first degree murder 
  on the ground that the murder occurred while the appellant was committing an 
  unlawful confinement, the preliminary hearing judge said that as it would be 
  open to the jury to find that an unlawful confinement was inherent in the alleged 
  sexual assault of the victim, the appellant was also liable to conviction for 
  first degree murder under s. 231(5)(e). However, the judge added that were there 
  to be no evidence of a sexual assault, the remaining evidence would not support 
  committal for trial on a finding of an underlying offence of unlawful confinement.</p>
<p>
  [4] Throughout these proceedings, it has been the appellant's position that 
  as there is no evidence of either an attempted, or completed, sexual assault 
  or an unlawful confinement, a jury could not find that he caused the victim's 
  death while committing, or attempting to commit, either of these underlying 
  offences as required by s. 231(5). He submits that the preliminary hearing judge 
  exceeded his jurisdiction in ordering him to stand trial on first degree murder 
  in the absence of any supporting evidence and that the reviewing justice erred 
  in law in upholding that order. He contends, therefore, that he should have 
  been ordered to stand trial on second degree murder. We agree with the appellant's 
  submission.</p>
<p>
  [5] The theory of the Crown at the preliminary inquiry was that the appellant 
  engaged in non-consensual anal intercourse with the deceased. There was a body 
  of evidence to support the theory that the deceased had an aversion to anal 
  intercourse. Therefore if there was any evidence of anal intercourse it would 
  be open to a trier of fact to find that such act was without consent of the 
  deceased and therefore a sexual assault. It would similarly be open to a trier 
  of fact to find that the murder and the sexual assault formed part of one continuous 
  sequence of events thus justifying an order to stand trial on first degree murder 
  under s. 231(5) of the Criminal Code. However, there was no evidence of an act 
  of anal intercourse and therefore no evidence of a sexual assault.</p>
<p>
  [6] There was evidence of a sexual encounter between the appellant and the deceased 
  prior to the murder. The DNA testing that showed a mixture of the deceased's 
  semen and the appellant's saliva on the bed sheet suggested that the appellant 
  performed an act of fellatio on the deceased. The Crown did not suggest that 
  this act could be non-consensual. </p>
<p>
  [7] There was no evidence of any injury to the rectum or anus. The analyst also 
  found 17 sperm cells in the deceased's anal cavity. The DNA profile of these 
  sperm cells matched the deceased, not the appellant. The analyst testified that 
  either the deceased was the donor of the semen or the donor of the semen was 
  unknown. The explanation for the presence of the deceased's own semen in his 
  rectum was that after ejaculation during the act of fellatio the semen might 
  have migrated to the deceased's anus and seeped into his rectum. That explanation 
  contradicts a suggestion of anal intercourse. </p>
<p>
  [8] The possibility that the donor of the semen was unknown was based on the 
  theory that the analyst was actually unable to obtain a DNA profile from the 
  sperm cells and was instead picking up the deceased's epithelial profile. There 
  are significant problems with this theory as a basis for anal intercourse. Seventeen 
  sperm cells are no more than a trace amount. The normal ejaculate contains 150 
  to 300 million sperm. The preliminary inquiry judge appears to have based his 
  finding of anal intercourse on his understanding that the 17 sperm cells were 
  the remnant of a much larger deposit that had been lost during the period from 
  the time of death until the taking of the swab as part of the autopsy. However, 
  as the reviewing justice pointed out, this was based on a misapprehension of 
  the evidence. While sperm will be lost over a period of 60 to 72 hours after 
  being deposited in the cavity of a living person, following death, the loss 
  of semen slows down or stops. Had anal intercourse occurred four hours prior 
  to death, sperm in excess of the 17 sperm cells actually found would be expected 
  to be present. On a proper interpretation of the evidence, there was only speculation 
  that the appellant engaged in anal intercourse with the deceased while committing 
  the murder. There was no body of evidence from which an inference of anal intercourse 
  could be drawn.</p>
<p>
  [9] While the reviewing justice recognized that the preliminary hearing judge 
  misinterpreted the expert evidence, he nevertheless went on to hold that it 
  was possible there had been anal intercourse because the analyst did not testify 
  that there "necessarily had to have been much more sperm". Thus, he 
  held that "it remains a reasonable possibility that the accused could have 
  deposited the sperm in the deceased's anus as part of the murderous transaction". 
  There was no evidence to support this theory. The fact remains that there was 
  only the trace amount of sperm found. The absence of evidence cannot be a legitimate 
  basis for an inference of anal intercourse. There is no evidence of a larger 
  deposit in the anal cavity and no evidence that the sperm cells were the appellant's. 
  All the evidence points the other way. </p>
<p>
  [10] In addition, the reviewing justice found that the circumstances supported 
  committal on first degree murder based upon an "alternative scenario" 
  of consensual sexual conduct not involving anal intercourse which escalated 
  into a violent struggle that resulted in the victim being "strangled from 
  behind with the [appellant] kneeling on the naked deceased's back during the 
  strangulation". The reviewing justice based this theory on the premise 
  that the initial consensual sexual activity "then became non-consensual 
  and, ultimately, that the extreme violence took its highest form, that being 
  the killing of the deceased. Indeed, it was the deceased's physical resistance 
  to the accused's sexual conduct that triggered the victim's violent death. Again, 
  the deceased was naked in the bedroom, the struggle in the bedroom was extremely 
  violent and the deceased was strangled from behind with the accused kneeling 
  on the naked deceased's back during the strangulation." It is not apparent 
  that this scenario was placed before the preliminary inquiry judge. In any event, 
  it cannot support the order to stand trial for first degree murder. Once the 
  anal intercourse theory is eliminated, there was no evidence of the fundamental 
  premise that the initial sexual activity became non-consensual or that the deceased's 
  resistance to that activity triggered the murder. Contrary to the finding of 
  the reviewing justice, aside from the actual act of murder there was no evidence 
  of an extremely violent struggle.</p>
<p>
  [11] To the extent that the reviewing justice may have based his finding on 
  an element of unlawful confinement, as counsel for the Crown has fairly conceded, 
  there is no evidence to support the appellant's committal based on the commission 
  of an unlawful confinement.</p>
<p>
  [12] In summary, there was no evidence to support an order to stand trial for 
  first degree murder on the ground that the appellant either sexually assaulted 
  or unlawfully confined the deceased in the course of causing his death. </p>
<p>
  [13] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the order to stand trial on first degree 
  murder is quashed and the appellant is ordered to stand trial for second degree 
  murder.</p>
