<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: February 25, 2004</p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal by Helen?Marie Mader from the order of Wein J. giving 
  effect to an order by Mossip J. dismissing her claim against the respondents 
  Hunter and Motors Insurance Corporation. This claim arises from a motor vehicle 
  accident in which Hunter collided with the rear of the appellant's vehicle. 
  Motors Insurance Corporation is the appellant's insurer and is joined in this 
  action in respect to a claim for statutory accident benefits.</p>
<p>
  [2] When the claim was issued the appellant was represented by counsel. Subsequently, 
  however, she represented herself on several interlocutory motions and when she 
  was examined for discovery. Ultimately, the motion judge dismissed this action 
  on the ground that the appellant had not fulfilled the undertakings which she 
  had given on her examination for discovery. The majority of the undertakings 
  related to evidence concerning her medical condition. Because of the appellant's 
  failure to make reasonable efforts to fulfill the undertakings and given "the 
  long history" of the case, the motion judge dismissed the appellant's motion 
  to set aside an earlier order of Mossip J. dismissing the appellant's claim. 
  The respondents provided no evidence before the motion judge that they would 
  be prejudiced were the appellant to be permitted to proceed to trial.</p>
<p>
  [3] In our view, in the exercise of her discretion the motion judge failed to 
  balance the interests of the appellant in respect to the prejudice that she 
  would sustain if the action were dismissed against any prejudice to the defendants 
  were the action to be permitted to go to trial. </p>
<p> [4] The court is always reluctant to dismiss a potentially meritorious claim 
  on grounds that do not address its merits. Unless the defendant can demonstrate 
  prejudice in the sense that to grant the plaintiff the indulgence he or she 
  seeks will prejudice the defendant's ability to defend the claim, the indulgence 
  will usually be granted on appropriate terms. Applying what this court said 
  in Byers (Litigation Guardian of) v. Pentex Print Masters Industries Inc. (2003), 
  62 O.R. (3d) 647, in our view, the justice of the case requires that the order 
  of the motion judge be set aside and that an order be substituted setting aside 
  the order of Mossip J. dismissing the appellant's claim. In the circumstances 
  of this case, denying the appellant a further adjournment in the absence of 
  any prejudice to the respondents and in the absence of a consideration of the 
  potential merits of the plaintiff's claim, in our view, was contrary to the 
  interests of justice.</p>
<p>
  [5] With respect to the plaintiff's motion for the admission of fresh evidence, 
  in our view most of the proposed fresh evidence was available, or with reasonable 
  diligence could have been available, before the motion judge. Therefore, on 
  that basis we decline to admit the evidence. However, we have taken into account 
  the proposed evidence that since the dismissal of her claim, appellant's counsel, 
  as the respondents concede, has fulfilled the majority of the undertakings.</p>
<p>
  [6] Therefore, the appeal is allowed and the order of the motion judge is set 
  aside. There will be an order substituted setting aside the order of Mossip 
  J. dismissing the appellant's claim.</p>
<p> [7] We award no costs of the motion to introduce fresh evidence, and award 
  costs of the appeal to the appellant on a partial indemnity basis fixed at $7500 
  and GST.</p>
