<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Michelle Fuerst of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, sitting as summary conviction appeal judge, dated October 22, 2002, 
  dismissing the appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Robert P. Main 
  of the Ontario Court of Justice dated May 21, 1999.</p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. Introduction</p>
<p>
  [1] This is another appeal in which this court must determine whether the trial 
  judge gave adequate reasons for disbelieving an accused. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant, Yagianath Maharaj, was charged with sexual assault and sexual 
  interference of his girlfriend's twelve-year-old daughter, A.M., and the daughter's 
  eleven-year-old friend, A.G. The Crown contended that the appellant had given 
  the two complainants, as well as A.M.'s sister and a playmate back massages, 
  which progressed to inappropriate sexual touching. After a voir dire, the evidence 
  of all four girls was admitted as similar fact evidence. The appellant testified. 
  He admitted giving the back massages but denied any inappropriate sexual touching.</p>
<p>
  [3] The trial took place intermittently, on five days over five months. At its 
  conclusion, the trial judge gave oral reasons in which he acquitted the appellant 
  of the charges concerning A.M. and convicted him of those concerning A.G. He 
  sentenced the appellant to eight months in prison and two years probation. The 
  trial judge's reasons for conviction consist of ten pages. But his consideration 
  of the appellant's evidence occupies just a single sentence: "It is clear 
  as well that for me to have made these findings of fact, I reject outright Mr. 
  Maharaj's denials."</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant appealed his conviction to the summary conviction appeal court 
  judge on three grounds: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. In deciding on the admissibility of the similar fact evidence, 
  the trial judge failed to consider the possibility of collusion;</p>
<p class="indent">2. The trial judge did not give adequate reasons for rejecting 
  the appellant's evidence; and</p>
<p class="indent">3. The trial judge did not properly apply R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 
  1 S.C.R. 742 because he failed to consider whether the appellant's evidence 
  raised a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [5] Fuerst J. dismissed the appeal. The appellant now appeals to this court 
  on the same three grounds. I would allow the appeal on the second and third 
  grounds, which in this case are related. I, therefore, do not propose to discuss 
  the first ground.</p>
<p>
  B. Background Facts</p>
<p> [6] These offences occurred in December 1997. By then the appellant had a 
  three-year relationship with Heather M. She lived in Midland; he lived in Toronto, 
  with his parents. While they were dating he often spent weekends at her house. 
  The alleged inappropriate sexual touching took place during these weekend visits. 
</p>
<p> [7] The complainant A.G., whose evidence the trial judge accepted, testified 
  about two incidents of sexual touching. Both took place on the same day, one 
  in the kitchen of the M. home, the other in the basement. </p>
<p>
  [8] A.G. testified that one day after school she was making macaroni and cheese. 
  According to A.G., Heather was asleep on the couch, Heather's son was "all 
  over the house", and Heather's younger daughter J.M. had just left. A.G. 
  claimed that the appellant came up behind her, began rubbing her back under 
  her clothing, then reached around the front of her body and touched her breast, 
  and finally lowered his hand under her pants and touched her vaginal area and 
  buttocks. The appellant left briefly to look in on Heather but returned to the 
  kitchen where he touched A.G. a second and a third time. A.G. testified that 
  when the appellant began touching her for the third time he said, "I know 
  I shouldn't be doing this". </p>
<p>
  [9] According to A.G., a few moments later the appellant whispered to her that 
  he was going downstairs to the basement and asked if she would like to join 
  him. She went. She said that she did so because she wanted to supervise him 
  while he did the laundry and to retrieve some items she had left in the basement. 
  </p>
<p>
  [10] A.G. testified that once they were in the basement the appellant sexually 
  assaulted her again. He asked her to hop on the freezer, which she did. He then 
  asked her to take off her pants. She undid the top button and the appellant 
  pulled them down to her ankles. He touched her vagina, had her step on the floor 
  where he touched her vagina and breast, and then had her get back on the freezer 
  where he licked her vagina.</p>
<p> [11] At that point A.G.'s mother came to the door of the M. home and shouted 
  for her daughter to come home. A.G. got dressed and left. As she was leaving 
  she promised the appellant that she would not tell anyone what he had done. 
  He said, "Surprise me tomorrow". </p>
<p>
  [12] Although the basement incident occurred in December 1997, A.G. did not 
  tell the police about this second incident until just before trial in January 
  1999. She said that she did not disclose it earlier because she was "too 
  scared to tell [the police] everything". </p>
<p> [13] In his evidence in chief and in cross-examination the appellant denied 
  that either incident with A.G. took place. He elaborated on his denials by saying 
  that he had never seen A.G. cook at the M. home other than perhaps to make a 
  sandwich, and that he had never been alone with her in the basement. Although 
  he acknowledged scratching A.G.'s and the other girls' backs, he said that he 
  had never touched any of the girls on their breasts, buttocks or vagina. </p>
<p>
  [14] The trial judge "almost fully" accepted A.G.'s evidence. He found 
  her to be a "solid witness". He relied on the "detail" and 
  "subtlety" of her descriptions and concluded that it was "almost 
  impossible to imagine that they are fabricated." Instead, in his words 
  "they give every credence and a real ring of truth." Nothing, in his 
  view, turned on the discrepancies in the Crown's case. Having accepted A.G.'s 
  evidence, he simply rejected the appellant's evidence. He, therefore, convicted 
  the appellant of sexual assault and sexual interference, but conditionally stayed 
  the latter charge. </p>
<p> [15] The other complainant, Heather M.'s daughter A.M., testified about an 
  incident toward the end of her mother's relationship with the appellant. She 
  had been having nightmares and trouble sleeping. One night, the appellant gave 
  her several sleeping pills and, while she was lying in bed, the appellant began 
  rubbing her back. A.M testified that his hand moved down towards her buttocks 
  and that he rubbed her "almost near the chest area". She fell asleep. When she 
  awoke the appellant was lying in bed beside her, fully dressed. She told her 
  mother about the incident after she came home from school that day. </p>
<p>
  [16] The two similar fact witnesses - Heather's younger daughter J.M. and the 
  playmate - each similarly testified that the appellant began rubbing her back 
  and moved his hand toward her breast area. </p>
<p> [17] The appellant not only denied any inappropriate sexual touching, he also 
  denied giving pills to any of the girls. He testified that he had bought prescription 
  sedatives and left them at the M. home for Heather to use. </p>
<p>
  [18] The trial judge acquitted the appellant of the charges concerning A.M. 
  Although he seemed to accept that the appellant had given her sedatives, in 
  the light of her nightmares and trouble sleeping he had a reasonable doubt whether 
  the appellant's touching had been sexual. </p>
<p>
  [19] I turn now to the two related grounds of appeal: inadequate reasons and 
  the misapplication of W.(D.).</p>
<p>
  C. Discussion</p>
<p>
  [20] Trial judges have a duty to give reasoned reasons for their decisions. 
  This duty applies to their credibility assessments as much as to their fact 
  finding and legal analysis. In some cases, the failure to explain or justify 
  a credibility finding may disentitle a trial judge to the appellate deference 
  ordinarily accorded these findings. </p>
<p>
  [21] In R. v. Sheppard, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, Binnie J. gave three rationales 
  for the duty to give reasoned reasons: judges owe an obligation to the public 
  to explain their decisions; judges owe an obligation to the losing party to 
  explain why that party lost - in criminal cases this means accused persons are 
  entitled to know why they were convicted; and judges owe an obligation to counsel 
  and appeal courts to make appellate review of their decisions meaningful. </p>
<p>
  [22] To these rationales I add that giving reasoned reasons is an important 
  self-discipline for a judge. The well-known phrase "sometimes it just won't 
  write" signals that occasionally a judge's instincts about a case do not 
  stand up to reasoned analysis. The process of putting pen to paper - of articulating 
  the "path" to one's conclusion - may disclose a flaw in one's reasoning. 
  As L'Heureux Dub&eacute; J. sensibly observed in Baker v. Canada (Minister of 
  Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 at para. 39: "The process 
  of writing reasons for decision by itself may be a guarantee of a better decision." 
  </p>
<p>
  [23] Sheppard warns against conclusory reasons, that is, conclusions without 
  explanations for them. However, as desirable as it is to give reasoned reasons, 
  a failure to do so does not automatically amount to reversible error. In Sheppard, 
  Binnie J. explained that inadequate reasons do not confer "a free-standing 
  right of appeal" or "entitlement to appellate intervention" (para. 
  53). Instead, he adopted a functional approach. The adequacy of the judge's 
  reasons must be assessed against the rationales for giving them. In some cases 
  inadequate reasons do not preclude meaningful appellate review or prevent an 
  accused from knowing why he or she was convicted. For instance, the accused's 
  evidence may be obviously incredible, or the prosecution's evidence may be overwhelming 
  and unchallenged, and thus the basis of the conviction may be clear from the 
  record. Examples where this court has held that a trial judge's failure to give 
  adequate reasons for rejecting an accused's evidence did not warrant appellate 
  intervention include R. v. R.L., [2002] O.J. No. 3061 (C.A.) and R. v. A.S. 
  (2002), 165 C.C.C. (3d) 426 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [24] This is not one of those cases. This was a difficult case. The testimony 
  conflicted on key points and the Crown's evidence was marked by several inconsistencies. 
  The trial judge found that the Crown had not proven the appellant's backrubs 
  on one of the complainants, A.M., was for a sexual purpose. The other complainant, 
  A.G., disclosed the more serious of the two incidents she alleged - the basement 
  incident - for the first time just before trial. Moreover, the appellant did 
  not offer a mere perfunctory denial. He testified over two days - his evidence 
  consisted of ninety-seven pages of transcript. He acknowledged giving the four 
  girls back massages but denied touching them on their buttocks, breasts or vagina 
  and said that there was nothing sexual about these massages. He also explicitly 
  denied both incidents of sexual interference alleged by A.G. And he maintained 
  his denial throughout a lengthy cross-examination. </p>
<p>
  [25] There was nothing inherently unreliable or incredible about his evidence. 
  Indeed, the trial judge appeared to accept some of his testimony, for example 
  that his relationship with Heather was "running out of steam". Yet 
  the trial judge did not give any reason for rejecting the appellant's denial 
  of sexual interference. Instead, he provided only a conclusory statement: having 
  accepted A.G.'s evidence almost fully and having "made these findings of 
  fact, I reject outright Mr. Maharaj's denials".</p>
<p>
  [26] The summary conviction appeal court judge held that the trial judge's failure 
  to articulate his reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence was "not 
  a fatal flaw". I take a different view. In my opinion, the trial judge's 
  failure to explain why he rejected the appellant's evidence amounts to an error 
  of law that justifies this court's intervention.</p>
<p>
  [27] The appellant was entitled to some analysis of his evidence, alone and 
  in the context of the evidence as a whole: see R. v. Lagace (2003), 131 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 13 (Ont. C.A.). More importantly, he was entitled to know why his denials 
  were disbelieved. The words of this court in R. v. Strong, [2001] O.J. No. 1362 
  (C.A.) at para. 9 apply here: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Second, the trial judge offered no reason for his rejection of the appellant's 
  evidence. He simply said "I do not believe him". In a case like this, 
  some explanation for that conclusory statement was required. The appellant's 
  evidence was not inherently incredible.</p>
<p>
  [28] The conduct of the trial made it more imperative that the trial judge explain 
  his rejection of the appellant's evidence. The trial took place on isolated 
  days over several months. The appellant's own evidence was given on two days 
  a month apart. To ensure the fairness of the process, the trial judge had to 
  tell the parties and the public why he did not accept the appellant's evidence 
  or at least find that it raised a reasonable doubt. As my colleague Catzman 
  J.A. said in R. v. Brown (2003), 61 O.R. (3d) 619 (C.A.) at para. 28: </p>
<p class="indent">
  After an expression of gratitude to counsel, the reasons begin with reference 
  to the intermittence of the trial: days and half-days here and there over a 
  four-month period (a process which in itself warranted, in my respectful opinion, 
  greater elucidation than the bald statements that follow).</p>
<p>
  [29] Also, the absence of adequate reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence 
  makes meaningful appellate review problematic. This court cannot be satisfied 
  that the trial judge properly applied either the burden of proof or the principles 
  underlying W.(D.). Instead, his conclusory rejection of the appellant's evidence 
  suggests that he wrongly shifted the burden of proof to the appellant and failed 
  to consider whether the appellant's evidence, though not accepted, still raised 
  a reasonable doubt about his guilt. </p>
<p>
  (i) Shifting the Burden of Proof</p>
<p>
  [30] The trial judge's statement "that for me to have made these findings 
  of fact, I reject outright Mr. Maharaj's denials", suggests that he may 
  have engaged in the following forbidden reasoning: I accept the evidence of 
  the complainant A.G.; the appellant's evidence differs from A.G.'s evidence 
  on material matters; therefore I do not believe the appellant's evidence. This 
  reasoning is forbidden because it appears to shift the burden of proof on to 
  the appellant to explain away the complainant's evidence. This court made the 
  same point in Strong at para. 9: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In all these circumstances, a total rejection of his evidence to the point where 
  it did not even leave a reasonable doubt without any explanation is unsatisfactory. 
  In these circumstances, the absence of any explanation for rejecting totally 
  the appellant's evidence strongly suggests that he was disbelieved because the 
  complainants were believed. This approach ignores the burden of proof.</p>
<p>
  [31] See also R. v. Boffo, [1997] O.J. No. 5156 (C.A.); R. v. Guan, [2002] B.C.J. 
  No. 2248 (C.A.); R. v. Divenanzo, [2003] O.J. No. 3428 (S.C.J.). The trial judge's 
  apparent misapplication of the burden of proof is closely tied to a second error, 
  his misapplication of the principles underlying W.(D.). </p>
<p>
  (ii) Misapplication of W.(D.)</p>
<p>
  [32] In W.(D.) at 758 Cory J. prescribed a three step formula for assessing 
  credibility.</p>
<p class="indent"> First, if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously 
  you must acquit.</p>
<p class="indent"> Second, if you do not believe the testimony of the accused 
  but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit.</p>
<p class="indent"> Third, even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of 
  the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which 
  you do accept, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence 
  of the guilt of the accused. </p>
<p>
  The recitation of this formula has become commonplace in trial reasons. What 
  an appellate court looks for, however, is not its mere recitation but its application.</p>
<p>
  [33] This court has said more than once that trial judges are not required to 
  apply W.(D.) in the order prescribed by Cory J., or even to use his exact words. 
  The structure of the judgment or rhetorical consideration may dictate a different 
  order or different language. But when assessing credibility trial judges should 
  reflect W.(D.)'s underlying principles.</p>
<p>
  [34] One principle - relevant in this case - is that trial judges must show 
  they have considered W.(D.)'s middle ground: whether the defence evidence in 
  the context of the evidence as a whole leaves the trier of fact with a reasonable 
  doubt. Rosenberg J.A. discussed this point in the recent case of R. v. Minuskin, 
  [2003] O.J. No. 5253 (C.A.) at para. 22: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is important to stress that trial judges in a judge alone trial do not need 
  to slavishly adhere to this formula. This suggested instruction was intended 
  as assistance to a jury and a trial judge does not commit an error because he 
  or she fails to use this precise form of words. Nor is the trial judge expected 
  to approach the evidence in any particular chronology, for example, looking 
  first at the accused's evidence and then at the rest of the evidence. It should, 
  however, be clear from an examination of the reasons that at the end of the 
  day the trial judge has had regard for the basic principles underlying the W.(D.) 
  instruction. One of those principles is that it is not necessary for the trier 
  of fact to believe or accept the defence evidence for there to be a reasonable 
  doubt. Even if the trier of fact believes the prosecution witnesses, the evidence 
  as a whole may leave the trier of fact with a reasonable doubt. As it was put 
  by Cory J. in W.(D.) at p. 743, the trier of fact must acquit even if he or 
  she does not believe the accused's evidence because they have a reasonable doubt 
  as to the accused's guilt "after considering the accused's evidence in 
  the context of the evidence as a whole". </p>
<p>
  See also R. v. M.J. (2002), 157 O.A.C. 177; R. v.S.P. (2001), 150 O.A.C. 381.</p>
<p>
  [35] Here, the trial judge did not expressly address the second step or middle 
  ground in W.(D.). As she had on the Sheppard submission, the summary conviction 
  appeal court judge concluded that the trial judge's failure to do so was not 
  fatal. Again, I take a different view. The trial judge summarily rejected the 
  appellant's denials solely, apparently, because he accepted the complainant's 
  evidence. However, this is not a case where the mere acceptance of the complainant's 
  evidence inevitably meant that the accused had to be found guilty. And I am 
  not satisfied that the trial judge considered whether the defence evidence, 
  though not accepted, nonetheless raised a reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>
  D. Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [36] The trial judge's failure to give adequate reasons for rejecting the appellant's 
  denials and his failure to properly apply the principles underlying W.(D.) are 
  errors of law that call for appellate intervention. I would grant leave to appeal, 
  allow the appeal, set aside the conviction for sexual assault and order a new 
  trial. </p>
