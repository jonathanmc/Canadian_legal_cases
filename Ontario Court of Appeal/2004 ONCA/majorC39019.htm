<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice Douglas J. A. Rutherford, 
  of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on June 20, 2002. The 
  appellant John Major also appeals from the sentence imposed by Justice Rutherford 
  on September 20, 2002.</p>
<p>
  ROSENBERG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellants John Major and Sherry Ellen McBride appeal their convictions 
  for possession of heroin and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking. The appellant 
  Major also appeals his sentence. At the opening of the appeal, counsel for the 
  appellant McBride stated that his client was abandoning her sentence appeal. 
  The appellants were tried by a court composed of Rutherford J. and a jury. While 
  the appellants raise a number of grounds of appeal, their principal ground of 
  appeal concerns the validity of a search conducted by correctional officers 
  and police officers at a family-visit trailer on the grounds of Collins Bay 
  Penitentiary. The trial judge found that the warrantless search was authorized 
  by a regulation to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 
  20, that authorizes the search of an &quot;inmate's cell&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [2] In my view, the trial judge properly interpreted the regulation and therefore 
  properly found that the search was lawful. I would also not give effect to any 
  of the other grounds of appeal. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeals from 
  conviction. I would also dismiss the appeal against sentence of the appellant 
  Major.</p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [3] On May 26, 2000, the appellant McBride attended at Collins Bay Institution, 
  with her six-year-old daughter, for a visit with her husband, the appellant 
  Major. McBride and her daughter were to stay the weekend with Major in one of 
  the family-visit trailers on the grounds of the institution. </p>
<p>
  [4] Robert Frankovitch, the preventive security officer at Collins Bay, had 
  received information in April 2000 that McBride would be bringing marihuana 
  and one ounce of heroin into the penitentiary during the family visit scheduled 
  for May 26th. The source of this information was an inmate whom Frankovitch 
  considered reliable and who had provided reliable information in the past. Frankovitch 
  was also authorized to intercept communications between the appellants, which 
  he did over the course of a three-week period prior to May 26th. These communications 
  confirmed the plan to bring in the drugs and that McBride was going to pick 
  up the drugs in Toronto during the long weekend in May.</p>
<p>
  [5] The warden and deputy warden authorized Frankovitch to search the trailer 
  that the appellants were to occupy during the visit on May 26th. In the week 
  prior to the search, Frankovitch contacted legal counsel for Corrections Canada 
  to determine whether the trailer was considered to be an extension of the inmate's 
  living quarters, which would negate the requirement of a search warrant. Counsel 
  advised Frankovitch that the trailer was so considered.</p>
<p>
  [6] The search was conducted by correctional officers and members of the Ontario 
  Provincial Police (the &quot;O.P.P.&quot;). The O.P.P. attended at the institution 
  around 4:00 p.m. on May 26th and were briefed by Frankovitch. They left and 
  returned around 8:00 p.m. for a second meeting. Because the search was conducted 
  on penitentiary property, the officers did not believe they needed a search 
  warrant. The trial judge found that there had been plenty of time to obtain 
  a warrant, had one been necessary.</p>
<p>
  [7] Shortly after 9:00 p.m., the officers entered the appellants' trailer. The 
  officers found the appellants and their daughter sitting in the kitchen area. 
  The adults were ordered to lie on the floor and were placed under arrest and 
  handcuffed. The child was alarmed and upset by the entry and arrest. There was 
  a dispute between McBride and the officers as to the manner in which the search 
  was conducted. The trial judge found as a fact that the search was conducted 
  in the manner to which the officers testified, and therefore rejected the allegations 
  that the officers, for example, were brandishing firearms.</p>
<p>
  [8] After the arrests, Major led the officers to a rear bedroom where quantities 
  of heroin and marihuana were found in balloons. The officers also found a quantity 
  of marihuana in the kitchen. McBride admitted to the officers that she had brought 
  the drugs into the institution. In all, the officers found about an ounce of 
  heroin and eighty grams of marihuana.</p>
<p>
  [9] Jeffrey McKenna was one of the correctional officers who took part in the 
  search. His role was to videotape the search. The authorities searched two of 
  the family-visit trailers at about the same time. McKenna was involved in the 
  search of the other trailer first, and then came to videotape the search of 
  the trailer occupied by the appellants. The trial judge found that by the time 
  McKenna arrived, the initial entry and arrest had already taken place and the 
  drugs had already been found. By the time of trial, the videotape had either 
  been lost or the contents of the tape had been replaced with other material. 
  The appellants sought a stay of proceedings because of the loss of this evidence. 
  The trial judge's dismissal of that application also forms a ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant McBride testified at trial, and raised the defence of duress. 
  She claimed that several men had come to her house and threatened that her family 
  would be harmed if she did not cooperate. She also testified that she believed 
  all the drugs were marihuana. She testified that she had never examined the 
  contents of the packages, although some of the balloons had been left in her 
  custody for several weeks prior to the visit.</p>
<p>
  THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [11] The appellants advanced the following grounds of appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) The trial judge erred in finding that the warrantless search 
  of the family visit trailer did not violate their rights under s. 8 of the Canadian 
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and in refusing to exclude the fruits of that 
  search under s. 24(2).</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) The trial judge erred in dismissing an application to stay 
  the proceedings as a result of unreasonable delay contrary to s. 11(b) of the 
  Charter.</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) The trial judge erred in dismissing an application to 
  stay the proceedings as a result of the violation of the appellants' rights 
  under ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter due to the loss of the videotape.</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) The trial judge erred in permitting cross-examination of 
  McBride on a previous incident in which she allegedly brought drugs into the 
  institution and gave them to Major.</p>
<p class="indent">(v) The certificates of analysis were defective.</p>
<p class="indent">(vi) The trial judge erred in sentencing Major on the basis 
  that he knew that one of the drugs was heroin.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (i) The Search</p>
<p>
  (a) The trial judge's reasons</p>
<p>
  [12] The prosecution relied on provisions of the Corrections and Conditional 
  Release Act and Regulations to justify the warrantless search of the trailer. 
  Section 58 of the Act provides as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A staff member may, in the prescribed manner, conduct searches of cells and 
  their contents in the prescribed circumstances, which circumstances must be 
  limited to what is reasonably required for security purposes. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [13] Section 52 of the Regulations sets out the manner of the search: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Subject to subsection (3), where a staff member believes 
  on reasonable grounds that contraband or evidence of an offence is located in 
  an inmate's cell, the staff member may, with the prior authorization of a supervisor, 
  search the cell and its contents. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Subject to subsection (3), where a staff member searches 
  an inmate's cell and its contents pursuant to subsection (1), another staff 
  member shall be present at all times during the search.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) A staff member is not required to obtain an authorization 
  or conduct a search in the presence of another staff member in accordance with 
  subsections (1) and (2), respectively, where the staff member believes on reasonable 
  grounds that delaying a search in order to comply with those subsections would 
  result in danger to the life or safety of any person or the loss or destruction 
  of contraband or evidence. </p>
<p>
  [14] Neither the Act nor the Regulations define the term &quot;cell&quot;. There 
  are no provisions of the Act or Regulations that deal explicitly with family-visit 
  trailers. In his ruling, the trial judge found that Frankovitch had the requisite 
  reasonable grounds to search the trailer and had been properly authorized by 
  his supervisors. The trial judge described the trailer in these terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Clearly the description of the family visiting unit makes it a different sort 
  of cell at least physically if, indeed, it is a cell. It was described as a 
  trailer or small, cottage-like structure. It is locked in by a fence and is 
  within the prison walls. It had an open kitchen/living room/dining room area, 
  a short hallway, at least two bedrooms, and a bathroom.</p>
<p>
  [15] In her materials, Crown counsel provided a brochure entitled &quot;Private 
  Family Visiting Program&quot; that is apparently given to families that take 
  part in the family visits. The brochure states that the inmate and visitors 
  will be subject to the normal search procedures before and after each visit. 
  Certain games and toys are available in the visiting units, and a recreation 
  area with playground equipment is provided for children. When a visit is in 
  progress, &quot;staff members have regular contact with the inmate and visitor(s), 
  to ensure their security and safety. Prior notice would normally be given and 
  contact should be the least disruptive as possible.&quot; The unit is fenced 
  off from the rest of the institution. Inmates and their visitors are required 
  to remain inside the visiting unit for the duration of the visit. A visit may 
  be terminated at any time by the inmate or the visitors. Institutional staff 
  may also terminate the visit for the security and safety of the inmate and the 
  visitor. I will return to this brochure below.</p>
<p>
  [16] The trial judge concluded, &quot;although not without doubt&quot;, that 
  the family-visit unit was a cell within the meaning of the Act and Regulations. 
  He found that the ordinary meaning of the word did not lead to any &quot;definitive 
  conclusion&quot;. The core of his reasoning for finding that the unit was a 
  cell is found in these paragraphs from his ruling: </p>
<p class="indent"> Given the comprehensive nature of the scheme for administering 
  these federal institutions, it is my view that to construe the word &quot;cell&quot; 
  narrowly to include the space in which an inmate resides normally but not when 
  in a family visiting unit, notwithstanding that it is fenced in, locked, and 
  within the walls of the prison, would deprive the scheme and the institution's 
  management of an important part of their intended responsibility. That inmates 
  and visitors have some expectation of privacy even inside the institution is 
  not the point, that privacy is subject to the terms of the legislation is the 
  important point. In any case, a search of Ms. McBride's person was not at issue 
  here and her privacy in that regard was not violated.</p>
<p class="indent">I do not see that a visitor's legitimate expectation of privacy 
  is diminished by construing the term &quot;cell&quot; to include that enclosed, 
  locked space in which a family member may be authorized to spend time, be it 
  a day, a weekend, or whatever, with an inmate.</p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion, the management of a federal penitentiary does 
  not have to go to a Justice of the Peace in order to search the normal cells 
  or the cell that is a family, visiting unit when the conditions specified in 
  regulation [52(1)] are met. Those family, visiting cells are to be governed, 
  insofar as search and seizure is concerned, by the same comprehensive, regulatory 
  scheme as governs the rest of the space, including the inmates' traditional 
  cells in the institution.</p>
<p>
  [17] Having found that the visiting unit was a &quot;cell&quot;, the trial judge 
  held that the warrantless search was authorized by law and therefore there was 
  no violation of s. 8 of the Charter. The appellants concede that if the trial 
  judge correctly interpreted the Regulation, the search was valid. They did not 
  attack the constitutionality of the Act or the Regulations.</p>
<p>
  (b) Reasonable expectation of privacy</p>
<p>
  [18] The appellants recognize that regardless of whether the search was validly 
  conducted under s. 52 of the Regulations, they cannot succeed on this ground 
  without establishing that they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the 
  trailer, and that they therefore have standing to assert a violation of their 
  s. 8 rights. The trial judge did not expressly deal with the question of a reasonable 
  expectation of privacy. However, it is implicit in his reasons that he was satisfied 
  that the appellants had standing to raise the s. 8 issue. For example, he said 
  the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Inmates and visitors to penitentiaries have privacy rights and privacy expectations. 
  They are reduced, of course, from those of persons in ordinary life on the outside 
  for obvious reasons related to both the safety and the security of the institutions 
  and all within them.</p>
<p>
  The trial judge also noted: </p>
<p class="indent">
  That inmates and visitors have some expectation of privacy even inside the institution 
  is not the point, that privacy is subject to the terms of the legislation is 
  the important point.</p>
<p>
  [19] In any event, I am satisfied that the appellants had standing to raise 
  the s. 8 issue. The leading case on what constitutes a reasonable expectation 
  of privacy is the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Edwards (1996), 
  104 C.C.C. (3d) 136. That case concerned the right of an accused to challenge 
  the search of a third party's premises, his girlfriend's apartment.</p>
<p>
  [20] One issue not addressed by the parties in this case is whether the appellants 
  could assert a reasonable expectation of privacy because of their ownership 
  of the drugs themselves. That issue was raised in Edwards at para. 44: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the case at bar, one of the bases upon which the appellant asserted his right 
  to privacy in Ms Evers' apartment was his interest in the drugs. It is possible, 
  in certain circumstances, to establish an expectation of privacy in the goods 
  that are seized.</p>
<p>
  [21] In Edwards, the Court would not allow the accused to pursue that argument 
  since his position at trial and in the Court of Appeal had been that the drugs 
  were not his. By contrast, in this case the appellants have always admitted 
  possession of the drugs. Their defence was that they held them under duress. 
  However, since the matter was not pursued in argument in this court, nor was 
  it apparently pursued at trial, I will approach the issue of standing by resort 
  to the traditional Edwards analysis. The appellants' admitted possession of 
  the drugs will be one of several factors to consider. In Edwards at para. 45, 
  Cory J. held that the &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy is to be determined 
  on the basis of the totality of the circumstances&quot;. He then listed seven 
  factors for the court to consider, noting that the list was not exhaustive: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) presence at the time of the search;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) possession or control of the property or place searched;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) ownership of the property or place;</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) historical use of the property or item;</p>
<p class="indent">(v) the ability to regulate access, including the right to admit 
  or exclude others from the place;</p>
<p class="indent">(vi) the existence of a subjective expectation of privacy; and</p>
<p class="indent">(vii) the objective reasonableness of the expectation.</p>
<p>
  [22] The Crown contends that the appellants only meet the first factor, namely 
  presence at the time of the search. In my view, while the appellants' expectation 
  of privacy in a trailer within a penitentiary is reduced from that which might 
  be expected in an ordinary dwelling, they have a reasonable expectation of privacy 
  sufficient to give them standing to challenge the validity of the search. I 
  reach that conclusion for the following reasons.</p>
<p>
  [23] As conceded by the Crown, the appellants were present at the time of the 
  search. They also had possession and control of the drugs. They had possession, 
  although admittedly time-limited, of the premises. They had only limited control 
  over the place to be searched. The appellants do not meet the third and fourth 
  of the Edwards criteria since they do not own the place and have no history 
  of using it. As to the fifth criterion, they had virtually no ability to regulate 
  access. The appellants were not entitled to have other visitors in the unit. 
  On the other hand, as noted above, the brochure produced by the Correctional 
  Service promises that prior notice would normally be given of &quot;contact&quot; 
  between the correctional officers and the inmate and visitors, and that contact 
  should be the least disruptive as possible. Also, it seems that Major would 
  only have to visit with the people he wanted, and that he regulated access by 
  allowing/requesting that certain people come to visit.</p>
<p>
  [24] The most important factors in this case are the existence of a subjective 
  expectation of privacy and the objective reasonableness of that expectation. 
  To deal first with a subjective expectation, there need not be direct evidence 
  of a subjective expectation of privacy. A subjective expectation of privacy 
  can be inferred from all the circumstances. See R. v. Law (2002), 160 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at para. 18. In my view, in this case a subjective expectation 
  of privacy can be inferred from all the circumstances. The trailer was locked. 
  The appellants expected to sleep in the premises, and they brought their six-year 
  old daughter with them. No doubt their expectations were tempered by the circumstances, 
  in that they were on the grounds of a penitentiary and they did not hold the 
  key to the lock. Nevertheless, I am prepared to find that they did have a subjective 
  expectation of privacy. In terms of the objective reasonableness of the expectation, 
  perhaps the most compelling evidence of the reasonableness of the expectation 
  is the brochure itself. It describes the visits as private family visits and 
  states the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Inmates have the opportunity to use separate facilities where they may meet 
  privately to renew or continue personal relationships.</p>
<p>
  and</p>
<p class="indent">
  Visits take place in special family visiting units located within the institutional 
  reserve in an area providing as much privacy as reasonable. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [25] It seems to me that these statements by the Correctional Service fuel both 
  the subjective expectation of privacy and its objective reasonableness. Considering 
  all the circumstances, it is my view that the expectation of privacy, although 
  much diminished, is sufficient to give the appellants standing. I find some 
  support for this conclusion in the decision of the Supreme Court in Conway v. 
  Attorney-General of Canada (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 1. That case concerned the 
  reasonableness of cross-gender searches in the penitentiary. One of the practices 
  to which the inmate objected was referred to in the penitentiary as the &quot;wind&quot;. 
  During the wind a male or female guard would, without notice, walk the range 
  and peer into the inmates' cells. Speaking for the court, La Forest J. said 
  the following at p. 4: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Imprisonment necessarily entails surveillance, searching and scrutiny. A prison 
  cell is expected to be exposed and to require observation. The frisk search, 
  the count and the wind are all practices necessary in a penitentiary for the 
  security of the institution, the public and indeed the prisoners themselves. 
  A substantially reduced level of privacy is present in this setting and a prisoner 
  thus cannot hold a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to these practices. 
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [26] In contrast to the setting in Conway, in this case the trailer is not exposed 
  and the Correctional Service promises to the inmate and his family a reasonable 
  amount of privacy. The appellants had a reasonable expectation of privacy, giving 
  them standing to engage the protection in s. 8 of the Charter. </p>
<p>
  (c) The meaning of &quot;cell&quot;</p>
<p>
  [27] The modern approach to statutory interpretation adopted by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in numerous decisions is as set out in Elmer A. Driedger, Construction 
  of Statutes, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983) at p. 87 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are 
  to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense 
  harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention 
  of Parliament.</p>
<p>
  [28] See Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 
  26. This approach has been adopted in the context of statutes authorizing search 
  and seizure. For example, in R. v. Araujo, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 992 at para. 26, 
  LeBel J. said the following in relation to the wiretap provisions of the Criminal 
  Code: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [W]e need to give the section a fair and liberal reading as part of our country's 
  criminal justice legislation. Second, however, we must not forget that the text 
  of s. 186(1) represents a type of constitutional compromise. In particular, 
  the investigative necessity requirement embodied in s. 186(1) is one of the 
  safeguards that made it possible for this Court to uphold these parts of the 
  Criminal Code on constitutional grounds. &#133; As a result, s. 186(1) must 
  be read with a simultaneous awareness of the competing values of enabling criminal 
  investigations and protecting privacy rights. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [29] I would adopt an analogous approach in this case to the interpretation 
  of the provisions involved in this case. Those provisions, s. 58 of the Act 
  and s. 52 of the Regulations, must be read with an awareness of the competing 
  values of the security and safety of the penitentiary and protecting the reasonable 
  privacy rights of inmates and their visitors. The sections must also be read 
  having regard to the scheme of the Act, its objects and the intention of Parliament. 
  The trial judge adopted such an approach. He was particularly persuaded by the 
  comprehensive nature of the legislation. As he said, to adopt a narrow approach 
  to the term &quot;cell&quot; would &quot;deprive the scheme and the institution's 
  management of an important part of their intended responsibility [that is, administering 
  the penitentiary]&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [30] While I share the trial judge's unease about adopting this broad definition 
  of the term &quot;cell&quot;, I am satisfied that he came to the correct conclusion. 
  The purpose of the correctional system as set out in s. 3 of the Act is &quot;to 
  contribute to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society&quot;. This 
  is accomplished by carrying out sentences through the safe and humane custody 
  and supervision of offenders, and by assisting with the rehabilitation of offenders 
  and their reintegration into the community as law-abiding citizens through the 
  provision of programs in the penitentiary and the community. The private family-visit 
  program is obviously one of those programs. The pamphlet sets this out explicitly 
  in the introduction, stating that the program is established &quot;in order 
  that inmates may develop and maintain positive family and community relationships 
  that will assist them to prepare for reintegration as law-abiding citizens&quot;. 
  Further, as I pointed out earlier, the pamphlet says that the program gives 
  inmates &quot;the opportunity to use separate facilities where they may meet 
  privately to renew or continue personal relationships&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [31] Thus, the Correctional Service has recognized that a necessary element 
  to make this program effective is the condition of privacy to continue &quot;personal 
  relationships&quot;. However, this provision of privacy still takes place within 
  the penitentiary setting and the inmate remains subject to the control and discipline 
  of the penitentiary.</p>
<p>
  [32] Sections 46 to 67 of the Act deal with search and seizure. The provisions 
  are broad and comprehensive. The underlying principle appears to be that staff 
  members may conduct all manner of searches without warrant. There is a rough 
  hierarchy of search powers. Staff members may conduct routine non-intrusive 
  searches and frisk searches without individualized suspicion of inmates. More 
  intrusive searches require individualized suspicion or suspicion resulting from 
  the context. Section 48, for example, authorizes a routine strip search where 
  the inmate has been in a place where there is a likelihood of access to contraband. 
  As well, the more intrusive the search, the greater the safeguards; for example, 
  s. 52 requires written authorization by the institutional head for a body cavity 
  search. </p>
<p>
  [33] This theme applies to visitors and even other staff members. Thus, s. 59 
  authorizes routine non-intrusive or frisk searches of visitors without individualized 
  suspicion, but limits those searches to that which is required for security 
  purposes. More intrusive searches of visitors, such as a strip search, must 
  be based on reasonable grounds and requires the authorization of the institutional 
  head (see s. 60(2)). Also, the visitor is given the option to leave voluntarily. 
  Sections 63 and 64 similarly authorize warrantless searches of staff members. 
  The Act also provides for the search of motor vehicles. This part of the Act 
  concludes with s. 66, which provides for warrantless searches of an offender's 
  room in a &quot;community-based residential facility&quot; where an employee 
  of the facility has reasonable grounds to suspect that the offender is violating 
  or has violated a condition of parole, statutory release or temporary absence.</p>
<p>
  [34] Sections 43 to 72 of the Regulations complement the search powers in the 
  Act by setting out in some detail the manner in which the various search powers 
  may be exercised. Sections 51 to 53 address the searches of cells. They make 
  operational the broad search power set out in s. 58 of the Act. Section 51 deals 
  with systematic searches without individualized suspicion. Section 52, the section 
  involved in this case, authorizes the search of individual cells based on reasonable 
  grounds with the prior authorization of a supervisor. The section also provides 
  for a search without prior authorization in exigent circumstances. Finally, 
  s. 53 permits a search of cells in an emergency when the institutional head 
  believes on reasonable grounds that contraband or evidence that relates to the 
  emergency is located in the cells. The Regulations go on to deal with the search 
  of visitors and staff members.</p>
<p>
  [35] In my view, when these provisions are looked at as a whole, Parliament's 
  intention is relatively clear. In view of the reduced expectation of privacy 
  in the prison setting, Parliament intended to give the Correctional Service 
  power to conduct warrantless searches throughout the penitentiary. That power 
  extends to all persons within the penitentiary including inmates, visitors and 
  staff, and even reaches out into the community to a room in a community-based 
  residential facility that is occupied by an offender on parole or other temporary 
  release. If the appellants are correct, the one search that must be conducted 
  in a penitentiary with a warrant is the search of the family-visiting unit. 
  It seems unlikely that Parliament intended such a result, given the broad warrantless-search 
  provisions in respect of both other parts of the penitentiary and all persons 
  within the penitentiary, which provisions authorize quite intrusive types of 
  searches.</p>
<p>
  [36] Admittedly, the ordinary meaning of &quot;cell&quot; in the prison context 
  is the cell described in Conway at p. 4: &quot;A prison cell is expected to 
  be exposed and to require observation.&quot; It is open to the Correctional 
  Service to provide living units of different descriptions that give inmates 
  greater privacy in order to promote the objects and principles of the Act, especially, 
  in the words of the pamphlet, &quot;in order that inmates may develop and maintain 
  positive family and community relationships that will assist them to prepare 
  for reintegration as law-abiding citizens&quot;. However, so long as that living 
  unit is within the grounds of the penitentiary, in my view it can still fairly 
  be considered the inmate's cell. </p>
<p>
  [37] I am, of course, somewhat uncomfortable with the idea that in this case 
  Major's wife and six-year old daughter were sharing his &quot;cell&quot;. However, 
  the family-visiting unit retains some of the attributes of a traditional cell. 
  The unit is surrounded by wire fences and steps are taken to limit communication 
  between people in the various trailers. The family is escorted to the trailer 
  and locked behind a 10-15 foot gate. The units are monitored on a regular basis 
  and the occupants must present themselves to correctional authorities on request. 
  The unit becomes the inmate's living quarters where he is confined for the length 
  of the visit. There are extensive rules about items that may not be taken into 
  the trailer, including such routine items as alarm clocks and radios. Even children's 
  toys may not be brought in except with the authorization of the institutional 
  staff.</p>
<p>
  [38] To conclude, in my view, the family-visiting unit is a cell with enhanced 
  privacy to facilitate one of the purposes of the Act. Such an interpretation 
  provides a reasonable balance between the competing values of the security and 
  safety of the penitentiary and protecting the reasonable privacy rights of inmates 
  and their visitors. It allows the service to provide beneficial programming 
  to the inmate while maintaining the necessary control over the inmate and visitors 
  to ensure the safety and security of the institution.</p>
<p>
  [39] As the other conditions for the exercise of the search power in s. 52 of 
  the Regulations were met, the search was authorized by law. Since the constitutionality 
  of s. 52 was not challenged and the trial judge found as a fact that the search 
  was carried out in a reasonable manner, all the conditions for a reasonable 
  search within s. 8 of the Charter were met, and there was no violation of the 
  appellants' rights.</p>
<p>
  (d) Section 24(2) of the Charter</p>
<p>
  [40] Even if I am wrong and the search of the trailer was unreasonable, I would 
  not exclude the drugs seized during the search. The admission of this evidence 
  would not affect the fairness of the trial. See R. v. Buhay (2003), 174 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at para. 51. As to seriousness of the violation, the most important 
  factor is that the officers acted in good faith reliance upon reasonable legal 
  advice. This is not a case like R. v. Buhay, where the officers showed a casual 
  disregard for the rights of the accused and an indifference to the requirements 
  of the Charter. Here the officer in charge of the search sought out legal advice. 
  He complied with the provisions of the Act and Regulations that he honestly 
  and reasonably believed gave him the right to conduct a warrantless search. 
  Importantly, he had reasonable and probable grounds for the search. </p>
<p>
  [41] There are some factors in this case that tend to make any violation more 
  than trivial. This was an intrusion into the living space of the appellants 
  and their daughter. There were no exigent circumstances. The officers had ample 
  time to obtain a search warrant. However, because of the setting, the appellants 
  had a greatly reduced expectation of privacy. On balance, I would find that 
  any violation was not serious.</p>
<p>
  [42] As to the last set of factors to be considered under s. 24(2), the effect 
  of exclusion on the reputation of the administration of justice, in my view, 
  excluding the evidence would have a more serious impact on the repute of the 
  administration of justice than admitting it. This was a very serious offence. 
  Introduction of a drug such as heroin into the penitentiary setting is a very 
  grave matter. The evidence adduced at the sentencing hearing in this case indicates 
  that the majority of criminal offences committed within the institution are 
  related to the sale and use of contraband drugs. There have also been a number 
  of overdoses, some of them fatal, where inmates have ingested opiates. The drugs 
  seized during the search were essential to prosecuting the case. </p>
<p>
  [43] For these reasons, even if there was a violation of s. 8, the appellants 
  have not shown that the evidence should be excluded.</p>
<p>
  (ii) Unreasonable Delay</p>
<p>
  [44] There was a delay of just over two years to bring this case to trial. A 
  delay of that length requires investigation. This delay caused some prejudice 
  to the appellants. For example, pending trial, McBride was not allowed to visit 
  Major. After the charges were laid, Major was transferred to Millhaven Penitentiary 
  and remained there until just before the trial. The delay was apparently particularly 
  stressful for McBride.</p>
<p>
  [45] The longest period of delay was in the Ontario Court of Justice, and lasted 
  until the preliminary inquiry could be completed. Over one year elapsed between 
  the time when the charges were laid and the time when the preliminary hearing 
  began. A good part of this delay was attributable to preparation of disclosure, 
  including wiretap transcripts. Another part of the delay is explained by the 
  inherent time requirements of the case. All counsel agreed that one day would 
  be required to complete the preliminary inquiry. On the first day of the preliminary 
  inquiry, the defence conceded that there was sufficient evidence to justify 
  an order that the appellants stand trial, and that they only wanted the preliminary 
  inquiry for discovery purposes. At the end of the day, the preliminary inquiry 
  was not completed because the issue of the lost videotape had emerged and the 
  defence wanted to cross-examine other witnesses. Crown counsel offered to make 
  the witnesses available to testify out of court, presumably before a special 
  examiner. The defence declined that request and insisted on their right to a 
  preliminary inquiry before a judge. Thereafter there were a number of delays 
  necessary to complete the preliminary inquiry because of the court's inability 
  to schedule consecutive court days, and on occasion, because of the unavailability 
  of witnesses. </p>
<p>
  [46] This further delay of five months to complete the preliminary inquiry substantially 
  increased the time in the Ontario Court of Justice. The trial judge attributed 
  this delay to the defence. In my view, it was open to him to make such a finding. 
  The defence had conceded that there was sufficient evidence to warrant an order 
  to stand trial. They had declined the offer to expedite the process of hearing 
  from witnesses through an out-of-court process, and have offered no explanation 
  as to why that process would not have been satisfactory.</p>
<p>
  [47] When the delay attributable to the defence is subtracted from the overall 
  delay in the Ontario Court of Justice, the time between the charges being laid 
  and the order to stand trial is slightly in excess of one year. The delay between 
  the order to stand trial and the trial in the Superior Court of Justice was 
  seven months, within the period of institutional delay suggested in R. v. Morin 
  (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at p. 21.</p>
<p>
  [48] I agree with the trial judge's conclusion that the appellants did not establish 
  a breach of their rights to a trial within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) 
  of the Charter. As the trial judge said, the balancing of the interests of the 
  accused against society's interest in trying the charges on their merits required 
  that the trial proceed.</p>
<p>
  (iii) Loss of Evidence</p>
<p>
  [49] The appellants argue that their rights under ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter 
  were infringed because of the loss of the videotape. The appellants submit that 
  this videotape would have assisted them in establishing that the manner in which 
  the search was conducted was unreasonable. The appellants submit that this evidence 
  would have supported McBride's allegations that an excessive use of force and 
  the brandishing of firearms were employed in the search. The evidence indicates 
  that steps were taken initially to preserve the videotape. At some point, Frankovitch 
  either lost the tape or allowed it to be reused because there was no apparent 
  need for it. This may have been negligent on his part but it was not a deliberate 
  destruction of evidence. </p>
<p>
  [50] For the appellants to make out a case for a stay of proceedings in these 
  circumstances, they must show a reasonable possibility that the lost evidence 
  would have assisted their case. However, the trial judge made findings of fact 
  against them on this issue. He found that McKenna did not enter the trailer 
  and start taping until after the initial entry, arrest and finding of the drugs. 
  Thus, the videotape would not have assisted the appellants in their allegation 
  that the search was conducted in an unreasonable fashion. That finding of fact 
  is supported by the evidence. I would therefore not give effect to this ground 
  of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (iv) Cross-examination on the Prior Incident</p>
<p>
  [51] This ground of appeal arises out of the cross-examination of the appellant 
  McBride. Crown counsel asked her about a visit she had made to Collins Bay about 
  a year and a half before the offences. He then asked this question: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Do you recall Mr. Major being separated from you by the 
  prison authorities at that time and you were later told that he had drugs in 
  his possession?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes, I do.</p>
<p>
  [52] Counsel for the appellant Major then objected and submissions were made 
  in the absence of the jury. The trial judge ruled that Crown counsel could ask 
  McBride if she had brought drugs into the prison on an earlier occasion. When 
  the question was asked, she denied the suggestion. </p>
<p>
  [53] I agree with the appellants that the question set out above was improper, 
  if for no other reason than it called for a hearsay answer. It was also prejudicial 
  to Major. I am satisfied, however, that this single improper question did not 
  result in any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. In view of the nature 
  of the defence, McBride could properly be asked if she had brought drugs into 
  the institution on another occasion. The theory of the defence was that she 
  brought the drugs into the trailer because of threats from unknown persons. 
  If the Crown could show that McBride had engaged in the same kind of activity 
  on occasions when she was not subject to those alleged threats, this would tend 
  to undermine the defence. The probative value of that line of questioning outweighed 
  its prejudicial effect. While the improper question was prejudicial to Major, 
  realistically his defence hinged entirely on McBride's evidence, and the impugned 
  question, aside from its hearsay aspect, was not improper as it related to her 
  position. The Crown did not try to prove the truth of the allegation and McBride 
  denied the suggestion that she brought drugs in on the earlier occasion. Thereafter, 
  no one made any further reference to this evidence and counsel did not object 
  to the absence of a limiting instruction on the use of the evidence. I would 
  not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (v) The Certificates of Analysis</p>
<p>
  [54] The appellants submit that because of a discrepancy in the certificates 
  of analysis of the drugs, the Crown failed to prove the nature of the substances. 
  Section 51(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19, 
  provides as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Subject to this section, a certificate or report prepared by an analyst under 
  subsection 45(2) is admissible in evidence in any prosecution for an offence 
  under this Act or the regulations or any other Act of Parliament and, in the 
  absence of evidence to the contrary, is proof of the statements set out in the 
  certificate or report, without proof of the signature or official character 
  of the person appearing to have signed it. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [55] The officer in charge of the drugs testified that he submitted them for 
  analysis on June 6, 2000 and received back the drugs, together with some of 
  the certificates of analysis, on June 21, 2000. The certificates, however, are 
  dated June 20, 2001. In my view, it was open to the trial judge to find that 
  this obvious typographical error did not constitute evidence to the contrary. 
  The certificates were therefore admissible to prove the identity of the substances. 
  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (vi) Major's Sentence Appeal</p>
<p> [56] The appellant Major appeals the sentence imposed for the offence of possession 
  of heroin for the purpose of trafficking. The trial judge imposed a sentence 
  of three-years imprisonment consecutive to the sentence he was then serving.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in principle in sentencing 
  him on the basis that he knew the drug was heroin. He relies on the evidence 
  of the appellant McBride that she believed she was only smuggling marihuana. 
</p>
<p>
  [57] In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge made this finding: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I think it most probable that the jury disbelieved Ms. McBride's account as 
  to the circumstances of duress and as to her professed limited knowledge of 
  the nature of the drugs. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [58] Once the Crown proved that the appellant was also in possession of heroin, 
  the burden shifted to the appellant to show on a balance of probabilities, as 
  a mitigating factor, that he believed the drug was only marihuana. See s. 724(3) 
  of the Criminal Code. The trial judge was entitled to make the finding that 
  he did pursuant to s. 724(2)(b) of the Code and to sentence the appellant accordingly. 
  The sentence was a fit one given the seriousness of the offence.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [59] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeals from conviction. I would grant 
  Major leave to appeal sentence but dismiss the appeal. McBride's sentence appeal 
  is dismissed as abandoned.</p>
<p> Signed: &quot;M. Rosenberg J.A.&quot;<br>
