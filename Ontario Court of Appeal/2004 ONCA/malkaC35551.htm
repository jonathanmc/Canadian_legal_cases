<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was charged with extortion, assault causing bodily harm and 
  assault with a weapon. All three charges arose out of the same incident. The 
  jury acquitted the appellant on the assault causing bodily harm and assault 
  with a weapon charges, but convicted on the extortion charge.</p>
<p>[2] It is acknowledged that the Crown's case on the extortion charge depended 
  on the Crown proving that the complainant was physically assaulted by the appellant 
  in connection with the demand made by the appellant for the return of certain 
  money owed to him by the complainant.</p>
<p>[3] The Crown argues that as there was no instruction on the included offence 
  of common assault, the acquittals on the two assault charges do not mean that 
  the jury rejected the evidence that the appellant assaulted the complainant. 
  The logic of this submission is impeccable, however, the problem is that there 
  was no instruction given to the jury that the Crown had to prove a physical 
  assault in order to establish extortion in the circumstances of this case. Instead, 
  the jury was instructed in much more generic terms to the effect that extortion 
  could be proved by way of "threats, accusations, menaces or violence". 
  On this evidence, that instruction was too broad. In particular, the trial judge's 
  repeated reference to "threats" as a basis for convicting on the extortion 
  charge could well have suggested to the jury that words alone supported that 
  charge. There was evidence of a heated verbal exchange between the appellant 
  and the complainant.</p>
<p>[4] The Crown concedes that words alone could not establish extortion absent 
  physical violence on the evidence in this case. The jury should have been so 
  instructed.</p>
<p>[5] The non-direction amounts to misdirection requiring the quashing of the 
  conviction and the direction of a new trial. We note that the appellant has 
  fully served his sentence and it may well be that the Crown in the exercise 
  of its discretion will determine that further proceedings are not in the best 
  interests of justice. That is, of course, a decision for the Crown to make.</p>
