<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal by the Crown from an order quashing the respondent's 
  committal for trial on various charges. It was the position of the Crown that 
  the respondent and a friend were racing their cars along a city street when 
  the friend lost control of his car and struck another car resulting in an horrendous 
  accident. The issue insofar as the respondent was concerned was whether he was 
  the driver of the second car. The Crown led evidence of certain statements made 
  by the respondent as well as evidence of witnesses who witnessed the accident. 
</p>
<p>[2] In our view, the application judge erred in law by treating the application 
  to quash as, in effect, an appeal from the order committing the accused to stand 
  trial. After summarizing the evidence, the application judge said the following:</p>
<p class="indent">It is clear that, in this case, in order to make a finding of 
  guilt, a jury would have to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
  applicant was the driver of the second car. In my view, there was insufficient 
  evidence placed before the judge below on that issue such as could sustain a 
  committal for trial. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>[3] Later in his reasons, the application judge observed:</p>
<p class="indent">In order to justify placing an individual on trial for a criminal 
  offence there must found to be sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury 
  properly instructed could return a verdict of guilty. If there is an absence 
  of such evidence, then a committal in such circumstances amounts to an error 
  in jurisdiction. I conclude that the evidence presented at the preliminary inquiry 
  in this case was insufficient to satisfy the test. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>[4] On an application to quash a committal for trial based on the contention 
  that the evidence could not support the committal, the application judge does 
  not weigh the evidence against the committal for trial standard, but must only 
  decide whether there was any evidentiary basis upon which the court below could 
  form the opinion that the evidence was sufficient to justify a committal for 
  trial. As Justice Martin put it in R. v. Tuske, [1978] O.J. No. 1253:</p>
<p class="indent">The reviewing court is not empowered to determine whether in 
  its opinion there is any evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting 
  judicially could convict, but is confined to considering whether there is any 
  evidence before the committing justice upon which acting judicially he could 
  form an opinion that the evidence is sufficient to put the accused on trial.</p>
<p>[5] The evidence reviewed in Crown counsel's factum at para. 31 provided a 
  basis upon which the justice presiding at the preliminary inquiry could form 
  the opinion that the evidence justified a committal for trial. The correctness 
  of that opinion was beyond the application judge's limited role on a motion 
  to quash the committal for trial. </p>
<p>[6] The appeal is allowed, the order below is set aside and the order committing 
  the respondent for trial is restored.</p>
