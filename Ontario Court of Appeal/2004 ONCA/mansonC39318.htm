<p>On appeal from the order of Justice John R. McIsaac of the Superior Court of 
  Justice, sitting as a summary conviction appeal judge, dated December 19, 2002, 
  allowing an appeal from the order of Justice Jon-Jo Douglas of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice, sitting as a reference court judge, dated June 26, 2001.</p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. Introduction</p>
<p>
  [1] This appeal raises a difficult question of interpretation of the federal 
  government's gun legislation. </p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent, Kenneth Manson, and William Michelson are both avid gun 
  collectors. Manson is the registered owner of several firearms, including two 
  semi-automatic weapons. He has never owned a fully automatic firearm. Michelson 
  is also the registered owner of a number of firearms, including a fully automatic 
  Thompson Model 1928 A-1 submachine gun (the FA Tommy gun). Manson wants to buy 
  the FA Tommy gun from Michelson. </p>
<p>
  [3] All fully automatic firearms and many semi-automatic firearms, including 
  those that Manson owns, are now prohibited weapons. However, the grandfathering 
  provisions in s. 12 of the 1995 Firearms Act, S.C. 1995, c. C-39 (the Act) permit 
  individuals who owned registered, prohibited weapons when the Act came into 
  force to keep their weapons and acquire others under certain conditions. Both 
  Manson and Michelson own registered, prohibited firearms. The issue on this 
  appeal is whether the Act's grandfathering provisions allow Manson, the registered 
  owner of semi-automatic firearms, to acquire a fully automatic firearm. </p>
<p>
  Procedural background</p>
<p>
  [4] Manson applied under the Act for a registration certificate for Michelson's 
  FA Tommy gun. The Registrar of Firearms refused to issue a certificate. He held 
  that only individuals licenced to possess fully automatic firearms under s. 
  12(2) of the Act were eligible to acquire another one. Manson referred the matter 
  to a provincial court judge, as he was entitled to do under s. 74 of the Act. 
  Douglas J. confirmed the Registrar's decision and dismissed the reference. </p>
<p>
  [5] Manson then appealed under s. 77 of the Act to a Superior Court judge sitting 
  as a summary conviction appeal court judge. McIsaac J. allowed his appeal. He 
  held that Manson could acquire the FA Tommy gun under s. 12(5) of the Act, the 
  grandfathering provision that authorized Manson to possess his two semi-automatic 
  firearms. McIsaac J. directed the Registrar to issue Manson a registration certificate. 
  The Crown now appeals to this court. I would allow the appeal. I agree with 
  the Registrar and would refuse to allow Manson to acquire Michelson's gun.</p>
<p>
  B. Discussion</p>
<p>
  (i) The prohibition of automatic and semi-automatic firearms</p>
<p>
  [6] Beginning with the Criminal Law Amendment Act, S.C. 1977, c. 53, s. 3 (the 
  CLAA) the federal government has progressively limited the pool of people who 
  may own firearms. The CLAA prohibited all automatic firearms unless their owners 
  had registered them as "restricted weapons" by January 1, 1978. </p>
<p>
  [7] Between 1978 and 1994 a series of orders of the Governor in Council declared 
  other weapons to be prohibited or restricted. In July 1992 the Governor in Council 
  issued Prohibited Weapons Order, No. 11, S.O.R./92-465, Prohibited Weapons Order, 
  No. 12 S.O.R./92-466 and a Restricted Weapons Order, S.O.R./92-467. According 
  to the explanatory note for all three orders, the government intended to crack 
  down on "military or paramilitary" firearms, which included both fully 
  automatic and semi-automatic weapons. In 1994 Prohibited Weapons Order, No. 
  13, S.O.R./94-741 (PWO 13) "declared to be prohibited" a lengthy list 
  of weapons, consisting largely of those in the 1992 Restricted Weapons Order. 
  As I will discuss, the FA Tommy gun appears on PWO 13's list of prohibited weapons. 
  </p>
<p> [8] The provisions of the CLAA and the Prohibited Weapons Orders are reflected 
  in the Act and the current Criminal Code. Section 84(1) of the Code defines 
  "prohibited firearm" to include, inter alia, all automatic firearms<a href="#bottom">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
  and "any firearm that is prescribed to be a prohibited firearm". Section 91(1) 
  of the Code makes it a criminal offence for a person to possess a "prohibited 
  firearm" unless the person holds a valid licence and registration certificate 
  for that firearm. Section 2 of the Act incorporates ss. 84(1) and 91(1) of the 
  Code.</p>
<p>
  [9] Michelson's FA Tommy gun is a fully automatic firearm and, therefore, under 
  s. 84(1) of the Criminal Code and s. 2 of the Act, a prohibited weapon. Michelson 
  requires (and holds) a licence and registration certificate to keep it. </p>
<p>
  [10] Manson's two semi-automatic firearms are also prohibited weapons, as they 
  were prescribed to be prohibited weapons by PWO 13. Manson, too, requires (and 
  holds) a licence and registration certificate to keep his firearms.</p>
<p>
  (ii) The grandfathering of individuals in possession of registered, prohibited 
  weapons </p>
<p>
  [11] The Act, most of whose provisions came into effect on December 1, 1998, 
  introduced a universal gun registration system. Under s. 12(1) of the Act individuals 
  are not eligible to hold a licence authorizing them to possess prohibited firearms 
  "except as provided in this section". The remainder of s. 12 - subsections 
  (2) through (8) - "grandfathers" individuals who already own registered, 
  prohibited firearms. Grandfathered gunowners may hold licences to continue to 
  possess their prohibited weapons and to acquire others, provided they satisfy 
  the registration requirements of the relevant subsection of s. 12. The two subsections 
  of s. 12 relevant to this appeal are s. 12(2) and s. 12(5). </p>
<p>
  (a) Manson is not a s. 12(2) grandfathered individual</p>
<p>
  [12] I begin with s. 12(2). Under this subsection, grandfathered individuals 
  can continue to possess their fully automatic firearms and acquire others. Michelson 
  is grandfathered under this section for his FA Tommy gun. Section 12(2) reads: </p>
<p class="indent"> Grandfathered individuals - pre-January 1, 1978 automatic firearms 
</p>
<p class="indent">An individual is eligible to hold a licence authorizing the 
  individual to possess automatic firearms that, on the commencement day, were 
  registered as restricted weapons under the former Act if the individual</p>
<p class="indent">(a) on January 1, 1978 possessed one or more automatic firearms;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) on the commencement day held a registration certificate 
  under the former Act for one or more automatic firearms; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) beginning on the commencement day was continuously the holder 
  of a registration certificate for one or more automatic firearms. </p>
<p>[13] When the CLAA came into force on January 1, 1978, individuals 
  owning automatic firearms were required to register them if they wanted to keep 
  them. Automatic firearms that were not registered became prohibited. If they 
  were registered, they became "restricted weapons". Section 12(2) allows owners 
  of registered, restricted fully automatic firearms to acquire other fully automatic 
  firearms that had similarly been registered as restricted weapons under the 
  CLAA. </p>
<p>
  [14] Michelson registered his FA Tommy gun as a restricted weapon. He now satisfies 
  the requirements of s. 12(2) of the Act. On January 1, 1978 he possessed an 
  automatic firearm, the FA Tommy gun; on the day the Act came into force he held 
  a registration certificate for this gun under the CLAA; and since the Act came 
  into force he has continuously held that registration certificate. Michelson 
  is therefore licenced to keep his FA Tommy gun and to acquire other automatic 
  firearms that were similarly registered as restricted weapons under the CLAA. 
  </p>
<p>
  [15] On the other hand, Manson cannot rely on s. 12(2) to obtain a licence to 
  possess fully automatic firearms. Manson has never owned an automatic firearm. 
  He is therefore not grandfathered under s. 12(2) to acquire Michelson's gun. 
  </p>
<p>
  (b) Manson is a s. 12(5) grandfathered individual</p>
<p>
  [16] However, Manson does not claim that he can rely on s. 12(2). Instead, he 
  submits that he is "grandfathered" to acquire Michelson's FA Tommy 
  gun under s. 12(5) of the Act. Section 12(5) provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> Grandfathered individuals - Prohibited Weapons Order, No. 13</p>
<p class="indent">An individual is eligible to hold a licence authorizing the 
  individual to possess firearms that were declared to be prohibited weapons under 
  the former Act by the Prohibited Weapons Order, No. 13, made by Order in Council 
  P.C. 1994-1974 of November 29, 1994 and registered as SOR/94-741 and that, on 
  January 1, 1995, either were registered as restricted weapons under the former 
  Act or were the subject of an application for a registration certificate under 
  the former Act if the individual</p>
<p class="indent">(a) before January 1, 1995 possessed one or more firearms that 
  were so declared;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) on the commencement day held a registration certificate 
  under the former Act for one or more firearms that were so declared; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) beginning on the commencement day was continuously the holder 
  of a registration certificate for one or more firearms that were so declared.</p>
<p>
  [17] From the time the Act came into force and continuously since then Manson 
  has held a valid registration certificate for each of his semi-automatic firearms: 
  one was registered on March 5, 1993, the other on October 18, 1993. Both were 
  declared prohibited weapons under PWO 13. Therefore, Manson meets the conditions 
  of s. 12(5) for holding a licence for these semi-automatic firearms. He is grandfathered 
  to keep them and acquire other semi-automatic weapons similarly declared prohibited 
  by PWO 13. This is not in dispute.</p>
<p>
  [18] Manson submits, however, that s. 12(5) also entitles him to acquire Michelson's 
  FA Tommy gun because it too was declared a prohibited weapon under PWO 13. This 
  submission is the crux of this appeal. The summary conviction appeal court judge 
  accepted Manson's argument. I disagree. At first blush s. 12(5) does appear 
  to entitle Manson to acquire any other weapon prohibited by PWO 13, including 
  Michelson's FA Tommy gun. Read in context, however, such an interpretation of 
  s. 12(5) is not supportable.</p>
<p>
  (iii) Can Manson rely on section 12(5) of the Firearms Act to acquire Michelson's 
  gun?</p>
<p>
  [19] At bottom, this is a question of Parliamentary intent. Did Parliament intend 
  that registered owners of semi-automatic weapons be able to trade with registered 
  owners of fully automatic weapons? In my view, the answer is no. </p>
<p>
  [20] PWO 13 declared a long list of semi-automatic firearms to be prohibited 
  weapons. Most were semi-automatic weapons. But among the weapons declared to 
  be prohibited, PWO 13 listed a number of fully automatic weapons, including 
  the FA Tommy gun. Section 2(w)(iii) of PWO 13 provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The following weapons are hereby declared to be prohibited weapons: </p>
<p class="center">
  . . . </p>
<p class="indent"> (w) The firearm of the design commonly known as the Thompson 
  submachine gun, and any variant or modified version thereof, including the </p>
<p class="center">
  . . .</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) Thompson Model 1928.</p>
<p>
  The Crown acknowledges that s. 2(w)(iii) of PWO 13 refers to the fully automatic 
  FA Tommy gun owned by Michelson. </p>
<p>
  [21] Manson has continuously held registration certificates for his two semi-automatic 
  weapons since 1993; and PWO 13 declared the FA Tommy gun to be a prohibited 
  weapon. Manson therefore seems eligible under s. 12(5) of the Act to obtain 
  a licence for Michelson's gun. </p>
<p>
  [22] The Crown puts forward two main arguments to escape this conclusion. I 
  find neither argument persuasive. </p>
<p>
  [23] First, the Crown argues that the FA Tommy gun was declared a prohibited 
  weapon not by PWO 13, but by the CLAA. This argument ignores the distinction 
  drawn in the 1977 CLAA Act between prohibited and restricted weapons. The CLAA 
  regulated automatic firearms in Canada for the first time. It created two categories 
  of "weapon": prohibited and restricted. A prohibited weapon meant 
  any automatic firearm that was not a restricted weapon. A restricted weapon 
  meant any automatic firearm that was "registered as a restricted weapon 
  and formed part of a gun collection in Canada of a bona fide gun collector". 
  Because Manson had registered his FA Tommy gun under the 1977 statute as a restricted 
  weapon, it did not become a prohibited weapon until PWO 13 declared it to be 
  so in 1994. </p>
<p>
  [24] Second, the Crown argues that this court should give effect to the Regulatory 
  Impact Analysis Statement accompanying PWO 13. The Statement's "Description" 
  section emphasizes that the focus of PWO 13 is semi-automatic firearms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Orders in Council amend the Restricted Weapons Order to delete therefrom 
  23 semi-automatic variants of assault rifles. These firearms, as well as certain 
  other firearms...are then declared to be "prohibited weapons" pursuant 
  to the definition of that term in subsection 84(1) of the Criminal Code. </p>
<p>
  [25] The summary conviction appeal court judge rejected this argument, holding 
  that the Statement forms no part of the Order and "at best, articulates 
  mere unachieved regulatory intent." For different reasons, I agree that 
  the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement does not assist the Crown. </p>
<p>
  [26] Although the Statement is expressly said not to be part of PWO 13, courts 
  have used regulatory impact analysis statements like it to understand how regulations 
  are intended to work. See RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1994] 
  1 S.C.R. 311 at paras. 90-91 and Friesen v. R., [1995] 3 S.C.R. 103 at para. 
  63. However, the caselaw does not go so far as to say that these statements 
  are a complete guide to the purpose of the regulations they describe. In Sullivan 
  and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, 4th ed. (Butterworths Canada, 
  2002) at 210, Professor Sullivan warns against relying too heavily on purpose 
  statements in legislation: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he assistance they offer is limited. They typically recite the primary objects 
  of legislation, which are apt to be obvious in any event, while failing to mention 
  secondary purposes.</p>
<p>
  [27] Professor Sullivan's caution applies equally to regulatory impact analysis 
  statements in regulations. Here, the Statement accompanying PWO 13 is helpful 
  in understanding the Order's "primary object": declaring a wide array 
  of semi-automatic firearms to be prohibited weapons. But the Statement does 
  not address a "secondary purpose" of PWO 13: declaring to be prohibited 
  fully automatic firearms that previously had been restricted weapons.</p>
<p>
  Section 12(5) in context</p>
<p>
  [28] Although I disagree with the Crown's submissions on the interpretation 
  of PWO 13, I do not accept that Manson can rely on s. 12(5) of the Act to acquire 
  Michelson's FA Tommy gun. It seems to me that the flaw in both Manson's position 
  and the reasoning of the summary conviction appeal court judge is that they 
  look at s. 12(5) in isolation. Instead, s. 12(5) must be analyzed in relation 
  to s. 12(2) and the overall purposes of the Act.</p>
<p>
  [29] Section 12(2) limits the group of individuals entitled to acquire automatic 
  firearms to those individuals who had an automatic firearm before 1978 and had 
  registered it as a restricted weapon under the CLAA by January 1, 1978. </p>
<p>
  [30] I interpret s. 12(2) to be the only grandfathering provision under which 
  an individual can obtain a licence to acquire a fully automatic firearm. Section 
  12(2) excludes resort to s. 12(5) for the acquisition of fully automatic firearms. 
  Individuals who do not meet the requirements of s. 12(2) cannot acquire fully 
  automatic firearms; not even the owner of a firearm declared to be prohibited 
  by PWO 13 can do so. In other words, grandfathered individuals can only acquire 
  the type of weapon for which they were grandfathered. Therefore, they can only 
  obtain new weapons from other gunowners who have been grandfathered under the 
  same subsection of s. 12 as them. </p>
<p>
  [31] To the extent that the wording of s. 12(5) creates any ambiguity, I resolve 
  that ambiguity in favour of an interpretation that gives effect to the overall 
  purposes of the Act. Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 at 
  paras. 21-22.</p>
<p>
  [32] The Act seeks principally to ensure public safety. See Reference re: Firearms 
  Act (Can.), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 783. Parliament's gun legislation has sought continuously 
  to limit the number of people who can own firearms and to impose onerous restrictions 
  on those who do own them. Goodman J.A. made this point in Re Her Majesty the 
  Queen and Barnes et al. (1996), 27 O.R. (3d) 626 at 629 (C.A.): </p>
<p class="indent">
  A brief review of the history of the provisions of the Code with respect to 
  the possession and use of firearms is indicative of a clear and continuing intention 
  on the part of Parliament to impose more restrictive safeguards with respect 
  to the possession, registration and use of firearms in order to protect the 
  public from the dangers involved in the possession and use of such weapons and, 
  in particular, from the dangers involved in the possession of automatic firearms.</p>
<p>
  [33] Cory J. echoed this court's views about the dangers of permitting individuals 
  to possess automatic weapons in R. v. Hasselwander, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 398 at 414-17: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Let us consider for a moment the nature of automatic weapons, that is to say, 
  those weapons that are capable of firing rounds in rapid succession during one 
  pressure of the trigger. These guns are designed to kill and maim a large number 
  of people rapidly and effectively. They serve no other purpose. They are not 
  designed for hunting any animal but man. They are not designed to test the skill 
  and accuracy of a marksman. Their sole function is to kill people...There can 
  be no doubt that they pose such a threat that they constitute a real and present 
  danger to all Canadians.</p>
<p class="center"> ...</p>
<p class="indent"> Collectors are attractive targets for thieves who are seeking 
  these weapons with every intention of using them or selling them to others who 
  wish to make use of them. Members of the community are entitled to protection 
  from the use of automatic weapons. </p>
<p>
  [34] The overall purpose of the government's gun legislation, reflected in the 
  judgments of this court in Barnes and of the Supreme Court of Canada in Hasselwander, 
  strongly supports an interpretation of the grandfathering provisions of the 
  Act that would restrict, not expand, access to these dangerous weapons. </p>
<p>
  C. Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [35] Because Manson is not a registered owner of an automatic weapon he cannot 
  rely on s. 12(5) to acquire one. Therefore, he cannot acquire Michelson's FA 
  Tommy gun.</p>
<p>
  [36] I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and set aside the decision 
  of the summary conviction appeal court judge. I would restore the Registrar's 
  refusal to issue a registration certificate to Manson for the FA Tommy gun.
