<p>On appeal from the orders of Justice P. Ted Matlow of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated December 10, 2003.</p>
<p>ROSENBERG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal from orders made by Matlow J. on motions by the respondents 
  as defendants, Dr. Benaroch and the McGill University Health Centre, to stay 
  the action brought by the appellants-plaintiffs. The respondents submitted that 
  the Ontario courts had no jurisdiction to try the action or in the alternative 
  that Ontario is not a convenient forum. The motions judge granted the motions 
  and stayed the action. Regrettably, his reasons for doing so are unhelpful. 
  He wrote the following endorsement: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Staying this action for the reasons set out in the moving party's factum.</p>
<p>
  [2] I have nevertheless concluded that the motions were properly granted and 
  I would therefore dismiss the appeal. In my view, Ontario courts do not have 
  jurisdiction over this action and in any event, the respondents have demonstrated 
  that Ontario is not a convenient forum.</p>
<p>
  FACTS</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellants emigrated from Sri Lanka to Montreal in 1992. In December 
  1999, the respondent Dr. Benaroch performed surgery on the minor appellant Nivekha 
  to correct a condition resulting from bilateral Blount's disease. The surgery 
  was performed at the Montreal Children's Hospital, a division of the respondent, 
  McGill University Health Centre. Following the surgery, Nivekha's legs were 
  placed in casts. It would seem that the surgery was successful. However, the 
  appellants allege that after Nivekha was discharged from hospital, she developed 
  a high fever and severe swelling in her legs. Dr. Benaroch saw Nivekha about 
  ten days later and prescribed some medication. Several days later, the appellants 
  returned to the hospital and this time a different physician saw Nivekha. This 
  physician diagnosed Nivekha as suffering from compartment syndrome in the left 
  lower leg. Nivekha was readmitted to hospital where a surgeon other than Dr. 
  Benaroch performed further surgery. Several days later again, the appellant 
  underwent further surgery, performed by a third physician. The appellants allege 
  that Nivekha has been left with severe and permanent disabilities and deformities 
  in her left leg. From January to March 2000, Nivekha was monitored by Dr. Benaroch. 
  She also received occupational and physical therapy in Montreal.</p>
<p>
  [4] In April 2000, the appellants moved to Toronto so that the children could 
  receive education in English. Nivekha has been treated by several physicians 
  in Toronto including her family doctor and Dr. Miah Hahn, a pediatric orthopaedic 
  surgeon. She also received some treatment at the Hospital for Sick Children, 
  the Centenary Health Centre and the Back 2 Feet Clinic in Toronto. She receives 
  home care treatment, and her parents provide her with extensive therapy every 
  day. Nivekha is now seven years of age.</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellants started their action in Ontario on December 11, 2002. They 
  commenced a further action in the Province of Qu&eacute;bec the following day. 
  The appellants state that the Qu&eacute;bec action was commenced out of an abundance 
  of caution and to protect their rights.</p>
<p>
  [6] The male plaintiff, Nivekha's father, operates a part-time home renovation 
  business and also works for another company. He works seven days a week, fourteen 
  hours a day. His wife presently receives unemployment insurance. The gross family 
  income is approximately $35,600 per year plus unemployment benefits. The family 
  has two other children, aged three and five years respectively. They have no 
  relatives in Montreal. They allege that it would be a considerable hardship 
  for them to attend Montreal for trial.</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellants take the view that the major issue at trial will be damages 
  and that most of the witnesses on this issue, the various physicians and physiotherapists, 
  reside in Ontario. Nivekha's parents will also be witnesses at the trial.</p>
<p>
  [8] The respondents submit that liability will be the principal issue at trial. 
  Some twenty physicians were involved in the treatment of the plaintiff. One 
  of those physicians, a radiologist, has moved to Toronto. Five others have moved 
  to the United States. The others continue to reside in Qu&eacute;bec, with the 
  exception of one whose location is unknown. The fourteen nurses involved in 
  Nivekha's care continue to reside in Qu&eacute;bec.</p>
<p>
  [9] The parties concede that the law of Qu&eacute;bec will apply. The appellants 
  allege that the law of negligence and medical malpractice of Qu&eacute;bec is 
  similar to that of Ontario. It may be, however, that if the case is tried in 
  Ontario, expert evidence on the law of Qu&eacute;bec will have to be called.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  Jurisdiction</p>
<p>
  [10] Since the extra-provincial defendants (respondents) are not present in 
  Ontario and have not consented to Ontario asserting jurisdiction, the courts 
  of Ontario have jurisdiction to try this action only if the real and substantial 
  connection test is met. If this test is met, the discretionary doctrine of forum 
  non conveniens must then be considered.</p>
<p> [11] In Muscutt v. Courcelles (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 20 (C.A.) and the companion 
  cases,<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> Sharpe J.A., speaking for the court, 
  explained the scope and application of the real and substantial connection test. 
  The test is not susceptible of a fixed formula but rather requires consideration 
  and weighing of a number of factors. In all, there are eight factors to be considered. 
  However, the question of whether this province's courts should assume jurisdiction 
  does not depend simply on adding up the number of factors that favour one party 
  over the other. As Sharpe J.A. said at para. 75, "A considerable measure of 
  judgment is required in assessing whether the real and substantial connection 
  test has been met on the facts of a given case. Flexibility is therefore important." 
  I will consider the application of these factors in this case.</p>
<p>
  (1) The connection between the forum and the plaintiff's claim</p>
<p>
  [12] In my view, this factor weighs against the appellants. This action concerns 
  allegations of negligence that took place in Qu&eacute;bec in the treatment 
  of a Qu&eacute;bec resident. The initial follow-up treatment also occurred in 
  Qu&eacute;bec. At this stage, one has to assume that liability and damages are 
  both in issue. The appellants and the respondents will all have to depend upon 
  Qu&eacute;bec physicians and nurses with respect to liability and damages.</p>
<p>
  [13] As mentioned, the appellants submit that the main issue at trial will be 
  damages. They further submit that virtually all the witnesses with evidence 
  to give on the issue of damages are from Ontario. I do not accept this proposition. 
  It seems to me that the physicians and nurses that dealt with Nivekha while 
  she was still in Qu&eacute;bec will also have some evidence to give on the issue 
  of damages. While Nivekha has had follow-up treatment in Ontario, that treatment 
  has been sporadic. At this time, most of the treatment is being provided by 
  her parents, not by professionals. There is little beyond residence in Ontario 
  that connects this claim to Ontario, and as Sharpe J.A. said in Muscutt at para. 
  79, "[m]ere residence in the jurisdiction does not constitute a sufficient 
  basis for assuming jurisdiction."</p>
<p>
  [14] The appellants rely heavily upon Oakley v. Barry (1998), 158 D.L.R. (4th) 
  679 (N.S.C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed [1998] 
  S.C.C.A. No. 282, to which Sharpe J.A. referred with approval in Muscutt. In 
  Oakley, the plaintiff claimed that while living in New Brunswick she was misdiagnosed 
  as having hepatitis "B". She was treated for three years in New Brunswick 
  before moving to Nova Scotia. It was only when she was seen by physicians in 
  Nova Scotia that she learned of the misdiagnosis. She then received extensive 
  treatment from physicians in Nova Scotia. She was very ill, impecunious and 
  unable to travel. She would not be able to prosecute a claim in New Brunswick. 
  At p. 691, Pugsley J.A. summarized the factors that he found showed a real and 
  substantial connection to Nova Scotia: </p>
<p class="indent"> I would apply Morguard [Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, 
  [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077] in a flexible manner and conclude that in this case, there 
  is both a real and substantial connection between the subject matter of the 
  action and the Province of Nova Scotia, as well as a real and substantial connection 
  between the damages caused by the alleged negligence of the appellant physicians, 
  and the defendant hospital, and the Province of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p class="indent">The respondent was not aware that her treatment by the appellant 
  physicians was allegedly negligent until she was examined in Nova Scotia by 
  Nova Scotia physicians. This province is responsible for providing care to the 
  respondent. Her recovery proceeds in this province under the care of Nova Scotia 
  physicians, aided by provincial medical centres and staff. The province has 
  a significant financial interest in the well-being of the respondent. The respondent 
  is, as well, financially disadvantaged and dependant upon the province for assistance 
  to meet her day-to-day living requirements. The damages allegedly suffered are 
  on-going, and since the fall of 1990, have been sited in this province.</p>
<p class="indent">The respondent has deposed that she has suffered "problems, 
  trauma and personal despair" as a result of the alleged misdiagnosis of the 
  appellant physicians and the defendant hospital. While she does not particularize 
  the cost directly attributable to the alleged misdiagnosis, it is a fair inference, 
  that if her allegations are subsequently accepted by a Court, a portion of the 
  cost of her monthly expenses to date, presently borne by this province, and 
  perhaps in the future, may be recoverable from the appellant physicians and 
  for the defendant hospital. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [15] There is some similarity between the case before this court and that of 
  Oakley. In both cases, the alleged negligent act occurred in one province but 
  the suffering is on-going in the new province, and it is the new province that 
  is responsible for providing care. Further, in both cases it would be difficult 
  for the plaintiffs to pursue the claim in the original province. Finally, in 
  Oakley, the plaintiff was dependent upon her province of residence for welfare 
  and other assistance and Nivekha is, of course, dependent upon her parents who 
  reside in Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [16] There are, however, important differences. In Oakley the allegedly negligent 
  diagnosis occurred in New Brunswick and the plaintiff received care there based 
  on the erroneous diagnosis for three years until 1989 when she moved to Nova 
  Scotia. She continued to live with the incorrect diagnosis until 1993 when Nova 
  Scotia physicians made the correct diagnosis. She frequently made use of Nova 
  Scotia hospitals, and her witnesses respecting the impact of the misdiagnosis 
  all lived in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>
  [17] In the appellants' case there is little beyond mere residence to connect 
  Ontario with the claim. The original allegedly negligent act occurred in Qu&eacute;bec. 
  There is a dispute as to whether the "negligence" was detected in 
  Ontario or Qu&eacute;bec. However, the harm was detected in Qu&eacute;bec and 
  the subsequent operations to try to deal with the complications from the surgery 
  were in Qu&eacute;bec. As I have said, Nivekha has only infrequent contact with 
  medical professionals and institutions in Ontario concerning treatment for the 
  disability in her left leg. There is some suggestion that more surgery may be 
  required, but my reading of the record indicates that any further surgery is 
  well into the future and will not likely have occurred before the trial. In 
  short, this is not a case where the infant appellant is receiving extensive 
  medical attention in this province.</p>
<p>
  [18] The appellants also rely upon the result in Muscutt itself. In Muscutt, 
  the plaintiff was injured when a motor vehicle in which he was a passenger was 
  struck by a motor vehicle owned by one defendant and driven by another. The 
  accident occurred in Alberta, where the plaintiff had just recently moved to 
  take up new employment. After being released from hospital in Alberta, the plaintiff 
  returned to Ontario to live with his mother because of the severity of his injuries. 
  He required extensive ongoing medical care in Ontario. Following the accident, 
  one of the defendants also moved to Ontario. At para. 81, Sharpe J.A. found 
  there was a significant connection with Ontario because the plaintiff "required 
  extensive medical attention in Ontario", and his claim was "inter 
  alia, for pain and suffering in Ontario".</p>
<p>
  [19] The appellants in this case allege that Nivekha has been left with a permanent 
  disability as a result of the respondents' negligence, and that she endured 
  pain and suffering. It is a fair inference that the pain and suffering continued 
  in Ontario. The difference between this case and Muscutt is that in this case, 
  the extensive medical attention in the aftermath of the original operation was 
  in Qu&eacute;bec. In Muscutt at para. 79, in discussing the application of the 
  factor concerning the connection between the forum and the plaintiff's claim, 
  Sharpe J.A. referred to the following passages from a case comment by V. Black: </p>
<p class="indent"> Permitting a plaintiff to assume a new residence and sue a 
  defendant there in respect of events that occurred elsewhere seems to be harsh 
  to defendants, and this is particularly so when those events comprise a completed 
  tort.</p>
<p class="center">..&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Even if the connection is significant, however, the case for 
  assuming jurisdiction is proportional to the degree of damage sustained within 
  the jurisdiction. It is difficult to justify assuming jurisdiction against an 
  out-of-province defendant unless the plaintiff has suffered significant damage 
  within the jurisdiction. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>The record in this case does not support the suggestion that 
  Nivekha suffered significant damage within Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [20] In my view, this first factor does not favour the Ontario courts assuming 
  jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  (2) The connection between the forum and the defendant</p>
<p>
  [21] There is no connection between Ontario and the respondents, and the appellants 
  concede that this factor favours the respondents' position.</p>
<p>
  (3) Unfairness to the defendant in assuming jurisdiction</p>
<p>
  [22] An underlying theme in applying the real and substantial connection test 
  is order and fairness. Thus, as Sharpe J.A. explained at para. 86 of Muscutt: </p>
<p class="indent"> [A]cts or conduct that are insufficient to render the defendant 
  subject to the jurisdiction may still have a bearing on the fairness of assumed 
  jurisdiction. Some activities, by their very nature, involve a sufficient risk 
  of harm to extra-provincial parties that any unfairness in assuming jurisdiction 
  is mitigated or eliminated. </p>
<p class="indent">In Muscutt, the court found that assumption of jurisdiction 
  by the Ontario courts would not result in any significant unfairness to the 
  defendants; the defendants had been engaged in an activity that involved an 
  inherent risk of harm to extra-provincial parties. As well, as a result of mandatory 
  motor vehicle insurance requirements, the defendants' insurers would bear the 
  burden of the defence since the insurers were required to defend claims brought 
  in any province. Sharpe J.A. looked at these arrangements as reflecting "the 
  reasonable expectations of the motoring public" (para. 87).</p>
<p>
  [23] The appellants submit that here as well, the burden of defending this suit 
  would likely fall on an insurer. They point out that Dr. Benaroch has acknowledged 
  that he is a member of the Canadian Medical Protective Association. There is 
  no evidence that the Hospital carries insurance or what that insurance might 
  be. </p>
<p>
  [24] Unlike the activity in Muscutt, which involved a significant risk of harm 
  to extra-provincial parties, in this case the respondents were providing services 
  to a Qu&eacute;bec resident in a Qu&eacute;bec hospital. This was not emergency 
  surgery. It was not an activity fraught with risk to extra-provincial parties. 
  A trial in Ontario will involve a disruption to the practice of the various 
  physicians, nurses and other hospital employees that may be called to testify. 
  That disruption will not simply be to the lives of the witnesses but to their 
  patients as well.</p>
<p>
  [25] This factor is against a finding of a real and substantial connection.</p>
<p>
  (4) Unfairness to the plaintiff in not assuming jurisdiction</p>
<p>
  [26] There would be some unfairness to the appellants if Ontario were not to 
  assume jurisdiction. The appellants are persons of very modest means with no 
  family in Qu&eacute;bec. It would be difficult for them to prosecute a prolonged 
  trial in Qu&eacute;bec as well as care for their three children. Further, Nivekha's 
  father is going to suffer some financial difficulty whether the trial is in 
  Ontario or Qu&eacute;bec if he has to take time off work for any long period 
  of time; however, he could more easily make up lost work time if the trial were 
  to be held in Ontario by, for example, working during evenings and on weekends. 
  The appellants also submit that a trial in Qu&eacute;bec would be very costly 
  because of the number of Ontario witnesses that would have to attend. That is 
  no doubt true; however, if the action were to be tried in Ontario, the appellants 
  would still likely have to shoulder the costs of bringing Qu&eacute;bec residents 
  to Ontario to make out their case on liability.</p>
<p>
  [27] The appellants submit that a trial in Qu&eacute;bec will be very disruptive 
  to Nivekha because she attends school in Ontario and receives home therapy from 
  her parents. In my view, this claim is exaggerated. I do not think that Nivekha's 
  parents would take her out of school for any long period of time, whether the 
  trial was held in Qu&eacute;bec or Ontario. I do not think that Nivekha will 
  have to attend much of the trial. It seems unlikely that both her parents would 
  go to Qu&eacute;bec to attend throughout the trial. This situation is not like 
  Oakley, where the plaintiff was unable to travel to the other jurisdiction for 
  trial.</p>
<p>
  [28] On balance, however, this factor favours the assumption of jurisdiction 
  by Ontario.</p>
<p>
  (5) The involvement of other parties to the suit</p>
<p>
  [29] At this time, there is no involvement of other parties that could create 
  the risk of inconsistent results, although it is true that the appellants have 
  not yet identified the other physicians and nurses who might be parties to this 
  action. At this time, this factor is neutral on the question of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  (6) The court's willingness to recognize and enforce an extra-provincial judgment 
  rendered on the same jurisdictional basis</p>
<p>
  [30] It seems to me that Oakley and Muscutt demonstrate that Ontario would recognize 
  an extra-provincial judgment rendered on the same jurisdictional basis as in 
  this case.</p>
<p>
  (7) Whether the case is interprovincial or international in nature</p>
<p>
  [31] The assumption of jurisdiction is more easily justified in interprovincial 
  cases than international cases and thus this factor favours Ontario assuming 
  jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  (8) Comity and the standards of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement prevailing 
  elsewhere</p>
<p>
  [32] As this is an inter-provincial issue, this factor is not applicable.</p>
<p>
  Conclusion on jurisdiction</p>
<p>
  [33] A weighing of the various factors does not show a real and substantial 
  connection between this action and Ontario. Most of the factors are either neutral 
  or favour the Ontario courts not assuming jurisdiction. The factors concerning 
  the connection between the forum and the claim, the connection between the forum 
  and the respondents and unfairness to the respondents demonstrate that there 
  is not a real and substantial connection. </p>
<p>
  [34] In my view, Ontario courts do not have jurisdiction over this claim.</p>
<p>
  Convenient forum</p>
<p>
  [35] In light of my conclusion on jurisdiction, it is not strictly necessary 
  to consider the question of convenient forum. In any event, I am satisfied that 
  the respondents have met the test of clearly establishing that Qu&eacute;bec 
  is the more appropriate forum. There is considerable overlap between the real 
  and substantial connection test and the convenient forum test. The factors to 
  be considered in determining the convenient forum, in a contract case, were 
  summarized by MacPherson J.A. in Eastern Power Ltd. v. Azienda Comunale Energia 
  &amp; Ambiente (1999), 178 D.L.R. (4th) 409 (Ont. C.A.), (application for leave 
  to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed [1999] S.C.C.A. No. 542), 
  at paras. 19 and 20 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the location where the contract in dispute was signed;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the applicable law of the contract;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the location in which the majority of witnesses reside;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the location of key witnesses;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) the location where the bulk of the evidence will come from;</p>
<p class="indent">(f) the jurisdiction in which the factual matters arose;</p>
<p class="indent">(g) the residence of place of business of the parties; and</p>
<p class="indent">(h) loss of juridical advantage.</p>
<p>
  [36] An adoption and application of these factors to this negligence action 
  demonstrates that Qu&eacute;bec is clearly the more convenient forum. The surgery 
  and treatment alleged to have caused the injuries to Nivekha occurred in Qu&eacute;bec. 
  The action will be tried in accordance with Qu&eacute;bec law. There are witnesses 
  from both Qu&eacute;bec and Ontario. Many of the key witnesses on liability 
  and damages are residents of Qu&eacute;bec. Nivekha's parents, Dr. Hahn and 
  some of the damages witnesses will no doubt be key witnesses and they reside 
  in Ontario. However, it seems to me that the bulk of the evidence will come 
  from Qu&eacute;bec. This is where the critical medical records are located. 
  The factual matters arose in Qu&eacute;bec. The appellants do not contend that 
  they would lose any juridical advantage if the case were to be tried in Qu&eacute;bec. 
  Thus, the factors either favour Qu&eacute;bec as the place of trial or are neutral.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [37] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. The respondent Dr. Benaroch is 
  entitled to his costs fixed at $6,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST. The 
  respondent Hospital is entitled to its costs fixed at $3,000 inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
