<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Thomas M. Dunn of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated February 14, 2003.</p>
<p>
  SHARPE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Sharon Ann Mariani purchased a home from the appellants, John and Anne Lemstra, 
  pursuant to a standard agreement of purchase and sale. Some time after the transaction 
  closed, Mariani discovered structural defects in the construction of the home. 
  The issue on this appeal is whether the Lemstras are liable to Mariani for any 
  of the cost of repairing or demolishing and rebuilding the home. </p>
<p>
  [2] The Lemstras built the home on a piece of vacant land approximately four 
  years before they sold it to Mariani. John Lemstra acted as his own general 
  contractor and did some of the work himself. Anne Lemstra assisted in the design 
  of the home. It was to be the Lemstras' "dream home". However, due 
  to a change in John Lemstra's employment, they had to move. They vacated the 
  property and put it up for sale. The listing agreement described the home as 
  "well-built". Ten months later, Mariani inspected the home with her 
  own real estate agent and again with her father-in-law who had experience in 
  construction. He advised her that the home was well-built and she entered the 
  agreement of purchase and sale. The standard form agreement of purchase and 
  sale contained an "entire agreement clause" at clause 22, which provided: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There is no representation, warranty, collateral agreement or condition, whether 
  direct or collateral or expressed or implied, which induced any party herein 
  to enter into this Agreement or on which reliance is placed by any such party, 
  or which affects this Agreement or the property or supported hereby, other than 
  as expressed herein. </p>
<p>
  [3] The transaction closed approximately one month later on May 30, 1991. Some 
  time after the closing, Mariani discovered a number of problems with the house. 
  The most serious were cracking along a high centre bearing wall and excessive 
  dampness in the basement. Mariani commenced this action in 1993. In addition 
  to the Lemstras, Mariani sued the Corporation of the Township of Puslinch ("Township") 
  alleging negligent inspection. She also sued Alpine Homes Ltd. and Marinus Van 
  Engen, who had constructed the centre load-bearing wall. Over the next several 
  years Mariani retained various experts to advise her how to remedy the structural 
  defects of the centre wall and the building envelope. She did not carry out 
  any significant repairs and, after the home became infected with toxic mould, 
  she concluded that it was necessary to demolish the house and rebuild. By the 
  date of trial, she had commenced the construction of a new home on the same 
  property, but she had not demolished the house that is the subject of this litigation.</p>
<p>
  [4] Prior to the trial, Mariani entered into a "Mary Carter"-type 
  settlement agreement with the Township. The Township paid Mariani $150,000. 
  Mariani agreed that if all crossclaims against the Township were not dismissed 
  on consent, Mariani would not enforce any judgment against the other defendants 
  for more than their apportioned share of liability, which would avoid any claim 
  for contribution against the Township. The Township also reached a settlement 
  with Van Engen and Alpine Homes, whereby the latter agreed to dismissal of their 
  crossclaim against the Township. The Lemstras and the Township reached a partial 
  settlement. The Township abandoned its crossclaim against the Lemstras, but 
  the Lemstras were at liberty to advance their crossclaim against the Township. 
  The Township agreed not to defend the crossclaim and the Lemstras undertook 
  not to pursue any award of costs that might be made in their favour against 
  the Township. </p>
<p>
  [5] In the action, Mariani alleged a long list of defects in the home. The two 
  most significant were that the centre load-bearing wall was structurally unsound 
  and that the building envelope was defective, resulting in water penetration. 
  The trial judge found that these two defects were proved, but rejected all of 
  Mariani's other complaints and claims, including her claims for damage to personal 
  property, mental distress and the loss of rental of a basement apartment. </p>
<p>
  [6] The trial judge found liability on the part of both the Lemstras and the 
  Township apportioned at seventy-five per cent and twenty-five per cent, respectively. 
  The trial judge dismissed the claim against Alpine Homes and Van Engen.</p>
<p>
  [7] The trial judge found that the Lemstras were liable to Mariani for the cost 
  of demolition and reconstruction. He assessed damages in the amount of $299,610. 
  The primary basis for liability was the trial judge's finding that the Lemstras 
  had "fraudulently (or negligently) misrepresented" the house as being 
  "well-built". The trial judge also found that the Lemstras were liable 
  on the ground that they knew or should have known of defects in the house and 
  failed to disclose them, and that they were liable for the negligent construction 
  of the home and the economic loss suffered by Mariani. The trial judge rejected 
  the Lemstras' submission that Mariani had failed to mitigate her damages by 
  acting more quickly to remedy the defects in the house. The trial judge found 
  that the Township was liable for its negligence in failing to supervise or inspect 
  the building and apportioned its liability at twenty-five per cent. Finally, 
  the trial judge ordered prejudgment interest on the damages awarded from November 
  19, 1993, the date the statement of claim was issued.</p>
<p>
  [8] The Lemstras appeal the trial judge's findings of liability and, in the 
  alternative, his assessment of the damages and his awards of prejudgment interest 
  and costs. Although the Notice of Appeal is silent on the point, in their factum, 
  the Lemstras ask this court to find liability on the part of Van Engen and increase 
  the apportionment of liability as against the Township. </p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [9] The transaction between Mariani and the Lemstras was governed by a standard 
  form agreement of purchase and sale. The agreement provided no warranties or 
  guarantees as to the fitness of the property or construction of the house. Mariani 
  had the opportunity to inspect the house and satisfy herself as to its fitness. 
  She is bound by the venerable but enduring principle of caveat emptor - buyer 
  beware. As a result, she does not seek remedy in contract. Mariani can only 
  succeed if she can demonstrate fraud or the breach of some non-contractual duty 
  owed to her by the Lemstras.</p>
<p>
  1. Fraudulent Misrepresentation</p>
<p>
  [10] In the listing agreement between the Lemstras and their real estate agent, 
  the house is described as "well-built". The trial judge found that 
  although the statement that the house was well-built was not part of the agreement 
  of purchase and sale, "the plaintiff was aware of it and relied upon it 
  to her detriment". The trial judge further found that as John Lemstra acted 
  as his own contractor and did much of the work himself, "he either knew 
  or must be taken to have known of the defects." The trial judge also found 
  that, "[t]he statement made in the listing agreement that the house was 
  'well-built' and which the plaintiff says came to her attention prior to making 
  the offer, I find to be a fraudulent (or negligent) misrepresentation".</p>
<p>
  [11] The Lemstras submit that the trial judge erred both in fact and in law 
  with respect to this finding. I agree with that submission.</p>
<p>
  [12] It is common ground before this court that the elements of fraudulent misrepresentation 
  are: (1) that the defendant made a false representation of fact; (2) that the 
  defendant knew the statement was false or was reckless as to its truth; (3) 
  that the defendant made the representation with the intention that it would 
  be acted upon by the plaintiff; (4) that the plaintiff relied upon the statement; 
  and (5) that the plaintiff suffered damage as a result. </p>
<p>
  [13] While it certainly could be inferred that the Lemstras represented to their 
  own real estate agent that their home was well-built, in my view, there is no 
  evidence in the record capable of supporting a finding of fraudulent misrepresentation 
  in Marani's favour on elements (2), (4) or (5).</p>
<p>
  [14] With respect to element (2) and the knowledge or recklessness of the Lemstras, 
  I cannot agree that because of his involvement in building the home, John Lemstra 
  must be taken to know of the serious defects in construction. We were pointed 
  to no evidence that would indicate that Lemstra had any knowledge that the house 
  was defective. There is no legal principle to support the finding that as the 
  builder he is in law deemed or presumed to know of defects in the structure. 
  In addition, this finding appears to be contradicted by the trial judge's other 
  finding that the Lemstras "observed no significant problems with the construction 
  or with the finished home" and that the structural problems only became 
  known after the closing of the transaction. Finally, with respect to Anne Lemstra, 
  there is no finding of knowledge or recklessness on her part to support liability 
  against her in fraud.</p>
<p>
  [15] I have also concluded that there is no evidence in the record capable of 
  supporting the trial judge's finding that Mariani relied to her detriment on 
  any representation from the Lemstras that the home was "well-built". 
  Mariani was asked to identify the documents she saw prior to entering the agreement 
  of purchase and sale. Mariani specifically testified that she did not see the 
  listing agreement and another document derived from the listing agreement that 
  included the crucial words "well-built" home. None of the documents 
  she saw before signing the agreement included the representation that the home 
  was "well-built". While at one point Mariani testified that, prior 
  to entering the contract, she believed the home to be a "custom home, energy 
  efficient, well-built", there is nothing in the trial record that links 
  that impression to anything said or done by the Lemstras. I would add here that 
  the words "custom home, energy efficient, well-built" do not appear 
  in the listing agreement. Finally, before deciding to make an offer, Mariani 
  inspected the home twice, once with her own agent and once with her father-in-law 
  who was involved in the construction industry and advised her that it "appeared 
  to be a well-built home." </p>
<p>
  [16] Another significant problem with the trial judge's finding is that Mariani 
  did not plead fraudulent misrepresentation. His finding that such a pleading 
  is contained in paragraphs 16-21 of the statement of claim is plainly wrong 
  in law. In these paragraphs, Mariani pleads that the Lemstras knew or ought 
  to have known of the deficiencies and latent defects in the house, and that 
  they had a duty to inform the plaintiff of such problems. This pleading is simply 
  not capable of supporting an allegation of fraudulent misrepresentation, as 
  the essential elements of the tort are not alleged.</p>
<p>
  [17] Accordingly, I would set aside the finding of liability for fraudulent 
  misrepresentation.</p>
<p>
  2. Negligent Misstatement </p>
<p>
  [18] The trial judge appears to have also found liability for negligent misstatement 
  although he did not consider the case in terms of the requisite elements of 
  that tort. </p>
<p>
  [19] The elements of negligent misstatement set out in Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. 
  v. Heller &amp; Partners Ltd., [1964] A.C. 465 are: (1) a duty of care based 
  upon a special relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant; (2) a false 
  statement by the defendant; (3) negligence on the part of the defendant as to 
  the truth of the statement; (4) reasonable reliance by the plaintiff in the 
  truth of the statement; and (5) the plaintiff suffering damages as a result.</p>
<p>
  [20] There is no finding with respect to the issue of duty of care. The relationship 
  between the Lemstras and Mariani was governed by a standard agreement of purchase 
  and sale for real estate that explicitly excluded reliance upon any representations. 
  Consequently, it is difficult to see why a separate Hedley Byrne duty of care 
  in tort would not be excluded as well. In any event, as I have already found, 
  there is no evidence capable of supporting a finding of reliance by Mariani 
  on any statement by the Lemstras that the house was "well-built" and 
  that is sufficient to dispose of the tort of negligent misstatement.</p>
<p>
  [21] Accordingly, I would set aside the finding of liability for negligent misstatement.</p>
<p>
  3. Failure to disclose defects</p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge also found that the Lemstras were liable for failure to 
  disclose the defects in the construction of the house. The trial made the following 
  finding: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [S]ince John Lemstra himself acted as his own contractor and did much of the 
  work on the construction of the premises, he either knew or must be taken to 
  have known of the defects. The Lemstras' failure to advise the purchaser Mrs. 
  Mariani of these defects, in my opinion, is actionable and sufficient to allow 
  Mrs. Mariani recovery.</p>
<p>
  [23] A vendor may be required to disclose known latent defects: see P.M. Perell 
  &amp; B.H. Engell, Remedies and the sale of land, 2d ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 
  1998) at 102. However, as I have already stated, the trial judge erred by imputing 
  such knowledge to the Lemstras. I have already dealt with negligent misstatement. 
  Another possible head of liability would be innocent misrepresentation inducing 
  the contract. However, if made out, that claim would support rescission of the 
  contract, not liability for damages in tort for the cost of demolition and construction: 
  see S.M. Waddams, The Law of Damages, looseleaf (Toronto: Canada Law Book) at 
  5.640-5.650. No claim for rescission has been advanced. Accordingly, if the 
  trial judge intended to impose liability for some form of misrepresentation 
  other than negligent or fraudulent misstatement, it is my view that he erred 
  in law.</p>
<p>
  4. Negligent Construction</p>
<p>
  [24] While his reasons are not as clear as they might be, the trial judge also 
  appears to have found that the Lemstras were liable for the economic loss flowing 
  from the negligent construction of the home. He mentioned the leading case Winnipeg 
  Condominium Corporation No. 36 v. Bird Construction Co., [1995] 1 S.C.R. 85, 
  and he found that there were two latent defects that rendered the house dangerous. 
  The first defect was the centre structural wall and the second defect was the 
  problem with the building envelope and resulting moisture and eventual mould 
  that made the house uninhabitable.</p>
<p>
  [25] Winnipeg Condominium establishes that a builder owes a duty of care to 
  subsequent purchasers. As La Forest J. stated at para. 35: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [I]t is reasonably foreseeable to contractors that, if they design or construct 
  a building negligently and if that building contains latent defects as a result 
  of that negligence, subsequent purchasers of the building may suffer personal 
  injury or damage to other property when those defects manifest themselves. A 
  lack of contractual privity between the contractor and the inhabitants at the 
  time the defect becomes manifest does not make the potential for injury any 
  less foreseeable. Buildings are permanent structures that are commonly inhabited 
  by many different persons over their useful life. By constructing the building 
  negligently, contractors (or any other person responsible for the design and 
  construction of a building) create a foreseeable danger that will threaten not 
  only the original owner, but every inhabitant during the useful life of the 
  building [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>[26] However, a claim for defective construction is a claim for purely economic 
  loss, and recovery under the Winnipeg Condominium is subject to an important 
  caveat. The structure must be dangerous, not merely shoddy, and it is only the 
  cost of repairing the structure and restoring it to a non-dangerous state that 
  is recoverable: see Winnipeg Condominium at para. 12.</p>
<p class="indent"> [T]he degree of danger to persons and other property created 
  by the negligent construction of a building is a cornerstone of the policy analysis 
  that must take place in determining whether the cost of repair of the building 
  is recoverable in tort. As I will attempt to show, a distinction can be drawn 
  on a policy level between "dangerous" defects in buildings and merely "shoddy" 
  construction in buildings and that, at least with respect to dangerous defects, 
  compelling policy reasons exist for the imposition upon contractors of tortious 
  liability for the cost of repair of these defects.</p>
<p>
  [27] The Lemstras submit that the trial judge erred in three ways. First, they 
  submit that the Lemstras owed no duty of care to Mariani sufficient to sustain 
  liability for negligent construction. The Lemstras were not commercial builders. 
  Unlike the commercial builder in Winnipeg Condominium, they were not building 
  the house with the intention to sell it. The Lemstras built the home as their 
  "dream home" with the intention to live it in indefinitely. It was 
  only when their economic situation took a turn for the worst that they decided 
  to sell. </p>
<p>
  [28] I do not agree with this submission. Anyone who builds a home for their 
  own use must be taken to know that that their circumstances may change and that, 
  someday, they may have to sell it. As the passage I have quoted above indicates, 
  the duty is imposed not only upon building contractors, but also upon "any 
  other person responsible for the design and construction of a building". 
  See also Perell, supra at 143: "&#133;[A] vendor who is also a builder 
  assumes the same responsibilities as a third party builder." </p>
<p>
  [29] The Lemstras' second ground relates to the question of dangerousness. They 
  submit that while the centre wall was unstable, the house was not dangerous 
  in the sense that there was any risk to personal safety or of imminent collapse. 
  The trial judge found that the defective centre wall "rendered the premises 
  dangerous" but then added: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The various experts apparently did not conclude that it was unsafe in the sense 
  that the house was likely to collapse but it is clear from that same evidence 
  that the centre wall deficiencies made the house susceptible to movement or 
  shifting in any significant wind, or as the case may be, snow load.</p>
<p>
  [30] The trial judge also found that "the proliferation of mould &#133; 
  presents a danger to the occupants of the house." The Lemstras argue that 
  the toxic mould only developed after Mariani failed to take meaningful remedial 
  steps to prevent the penetration of water into the house despite the advice 
  of her own experts. The Lemstras say that even if the building envelope was 
  defective, the defects could have been remedied at a much lower cost if the 
  problems had been tackled in a timely fashion. The trial judge rejected the 
  contention "that the proliferation of mould was simply a lack of maintenance 
  by the plaintiff or indeed one that even now can be remedied". When it 
  came to considering whether Mariani had acted reasonably to mitigate her damages, 
  he found that, "[c]ertainly in the best of all worlds, in 1993 she could 
  have spent substantial money to correct the problem but I cannot say that by 
  acting as she did that she failed to mitigate the damages as a reasonable person 
  might". </p>
<p>
  [31] I would not interfere with the trial judge's findings with respect to dangerousness. 
  There was expert evidence that the centre wall was unstable and dangerous within 
  the meaning of the Ontario Building Code, R.R.O. 1990. While those same experts 
  agreed that there was no danger of imminent collapse, there was evidence that 
  the defect made the building unstable and that, if not repaired, it might collapse 
  under a heavy snow load and that if not repaired, "a catastrophic condition 
  may prevail". Similarly, with regard to the problem with the building envelope, 
  it is evident from what has actually happened that if not remedied, the entry 
  of water into the structure can lead to a condition hazardous to health and 
  to property in the home.</p>
<p>
  [32] In my view, the evidence on both defects is capable of bringing the case 
  within the Winnipeg Condominium principle. That case does not require the level 
  of immediate danger suggested by the argument advanced by the Lemstras. The 
  operative principle is explicitly preventative. Recovery for the economic loss 
  of repair is allowed to avoid the greater cost of recovery for personal injury 
  should the danger materialize and this must mean that the plaintiff is entitled 
  to claim for the cost of repairs required to avoid the danger and to prevent 
  it from occurring. La Forest J. stated at paras. 36-37: </p>
<p class="indent"> If a contractor can be held liable in tort where he or she 
  constructs a building negligently and, as a result of that negligence, the building 
  causes damage to persons or property, it follows that the contractor should 
  also be held liable in cases where the dangerous defect is discovered and the 
  owner of the building wishes to mitigate the danger by fixing the defect and 
  putting the building back into a non-dangerous state. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Apart from the logical force of holding contractors liable for 
  the cost of repair of dangerous defects, there is also a strong underlying policy 
  justification for imposing liability in these cases. &#133;[T]he plaintiff who 
  moves quickly and responsibly to fix a defect before it causes injury to persons 
  or damage to property must do so at his or her own expense. By contrast, the 
  plaintiff who, either intentionally or through neglect, allows a defect to develop 
  into an accident may benefit at law from the costly and potentially tragic consequences. 
  In my view, this legal doctrine is difficult to justify because it serves to 
  encourage, rather than discourage, reckless and hazardous behaviour. Maintaining 
  a bar against recoverability for the cost of repair of dangerous defects provides 
  no incentive for plaintiffs to mitigate potential losses and tends to encourage 
  economically inefficient behaviour.</p>

<p>
  [33] However, I do agree with the Lemstras' third ground, namely, that the quantum 
  of damages awarded by the trial judge cannot be sustained as damages for negligent 
  construction. The trial judge found that by the time of trial, the building 
  had no value and that Mariani was entitled to the lesser of the cost of replacement 
  ($300,000) and the difference between the price she paid for the property ($375,000) 
  and the value of the land at the time ($100,000), namely $275,000, plus the 
  cost of demolition ($23,000) for a total of $298,000. Under Winnipeg Condominium, 
  at para. 42, Mariani is entitled only "to the reasonable cost of putting 
  the building into a non-dangerous state". As I have rejected the other 
  grounds for liability, it follows that the damages must be assessed based on 
  liability for negligent construction, and reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>
  [34] It is admittedly difficult to measure those damages on the basis of the 
  findings of the trial judge, but in view of the extremely protracted course 
  this litigation has followed, it is in the interest of all parties for this 
  court to do the best it can in order to bring this matter to completion. </p>
<p>
  [35] The Lemstras say that at best, Mariani should be limited to the cost of 
  the recommended repairs to deal with the two defects. In 1993-4, Mariani received 
  estimates for $13,624 to deal with the problems with the building envelope and 
  $6,000 to deal with the centre wall problem. However, Mariani considered this 
  to be a "band-aid" solution, and the trial judge found that she acted 
  reasonably in getting further estimates. The trial judge's factual findings 
  are entitled to deference in this court, and I would not interfere. In 1998, 
  there were two repair estimates, one for $100,657 and the other for $131,125. 
  In my view, it is appropriate to award Mariani damages in the amount of $100,657 
  for negligent construction on the basis that the structure could have been restored 
  to a non-dangerous condition for that amount.</p>
<p>
  [36] Mariani is entitled to prejudgment interest on that award at the rate prescribed 
  by the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, but having insisted on postponing 
  the repairs, she should not be awarded prejudgment interest from the date of 
  the statement of claim, but only from the date the cost would have been incurred. 
  I would take that to be the date of the estimate upon which the award is based, 
  namely October 29, 1998.</p>
<p>
  [37] In my view, there is sufficient evidence of Anne Lemstra's involvement 
  in the design and construction of the house to render her liable for negligent 
  construction and, accordingly, for these damages.</p>
<p>
  5. Liability of Alpine Homes and Van Engen</p>
<p>
  [38] I see no basis to interfere with the trial judge's finding that Alpine 
  Homes and Van Engen are not liable for any portion of the damages awarded to 
  Mariani and I would dismiss the appeal against them.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [39] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal in part and vary the judgment at 
  trial by </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Substituting in paragraph 1 damages assessed at $100,657. 
</p>
<p class="indent"> 2. Amending paragraph 2 to reflect the reduction in the damages 
  payable by the Lemstras to $75,493 in view of the apportionment of liability 
  with the Township.</p>
<p class="indent"> 3. Amending paragraph 3 to provide for prejudgment interest 
  at the rate prescribed by the Courts of Justice Act from October 29, 1998.</p>
<p>
  [40] In their submissions, the parties did not address the effect or impact 
  of the settlement reached between Mariani and the Township upon Mariani's entitlement 
  to enforce the judgment against the Lemstras. Accordingly, these reasons do 
  not touch upon that issue.</p>
<p>
  [41] I would not interfere with the trial judge's costs assessment of quantum 
  of the trial costs. However, the appellant shall have ten days from the release 
  of these reasons to make written submissions as to the effect, if any, of this 
  judgment upon the trial costs, and the respondent shall make any reply within 
  ten days thereafter. </p>
<p>
  [42] The appellants have achieved substantial success on appeal and I would 
  fix their costs of this appeal at $30,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements. 
  Alpine Homes and Van Engen are entitled to their costs of the appeal against 
  the appellants fixed at $3,500 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
