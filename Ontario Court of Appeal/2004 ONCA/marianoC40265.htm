<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We would allow the appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal. </p>
<p>[2] In our view, Himel J. was entitled to order judgment in accordance with 
  the offer to settle. As for the issue of equitable set-off, we are not persuaded 
  that she erred in permitting it in the circumstances. However, there was no 
  evidentiary foundation to support, nor did Himel J. provide reasons for, the 
  extinguishment of the remainder of the debt owing to the bank. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the cross-appeal is dismissed. Paragraph 
  two of the judgment dated June 3, 2003 is varied to read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">This court orders and adjudges that all of the monies paid pursuant 
  to the offer to settle shall be used to set-off the indebtedness of the plaintiffs 
  to the defendants.</p>
<p>[4] In the circumstances, we are of the view that the parties should bear their 
  own costs.</p>
<p>Signed: "R. Roy McMurtry C.J.O."<br>
  "M. J. Moldaver J.A."<br>
  "E.A. Cronk J.A."</p>
