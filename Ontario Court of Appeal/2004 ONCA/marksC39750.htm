<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Maria Linhares de Sousa of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated March 13, 2003 in Ottawa.</p>

<p>
  SIMMONS J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant appeals from the judgment of Linhares de Sousa J. dismissing 
  her claim for spousal support. The main issue on appeal is the proper application 
  of Miglin v. Miglin, [2003] SCC 24 to this case, involving a claim for spousal 
  support under s. 15.2(1) of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.) that 
  is inconsistent with the terms of a pre-existing separation agreement.</p>
<p>
  [2] In 1988, after a nineteen-year marriage, the appellant and the respondent 
  separated. Following the separation, the respondent paid interim spousal support 
  to the appellant pursuant to a consent order to enable the appellant to go to 
  the Dominican Republic to study medicine. In addition to the interim spousal 
  support, the respondent paid a lump sum payment to the appellant, provided her 
  with a loan guarantee, paid her moving expenses to the Dominican Republic, and 
  assumed responsibility for the care of the parties' two children, then ages 
  15 and 11.</p>
<p>
  [3] After completing her medical degree, the appellant returned to Canada in 
  July 1992 and the parties resumed negotiations, with a view to finally resolving 
  the issues between them. On December 1, 1992, the parties entered into a separation 
  agreement under which the respondent agreed to continue paying spousal support 
  to the appellant until June 1, 1994 and the appellant released all claims to 
  further support. At trial, the appellant testified that the purpose of the support 
  was to enable her to qualify to practice medicine in Canada. However, she never 
  qualified to practice and, in November 2001, finding herself destitute and relying 
  on social assistance for her support, she applied for spousal support under 
  s. 15.2(1) of the Divorce Act.</p>
<p>
  [4] The evidence at trial revealed that, because the opportunity for foreign 
  graduates to write the Canadian medical licensing examinations is quite limited, 
  the appellant planned to take a preparatory course, after the separation agreement 
  was signed, to enable her to write the United States examinations. However, 
  before doing so she returned to the Dominican Republic to obtain some documentation. 
  While she was there, her lawyers seized her support cheques for payment of legal 
  fees and she was unable to return to Canada until July 1994. </p>
<p>
  [5] Upon returning to Canada, the appellant moved to Montreal where she operated 
  a successful writer/editor/proof-reader business, eventually generating earnings 
  of approximately $30,000 per year. She also cohabited and shared expenses with 
  an individual earning approximately $90,000 per year. In 1998, the appellant 
  made the decision to move to Ottawa to live in her mother's home. She testified 
  that she had been unable to find steady work of any kind in Ottawa.</p>
<p>
  [6] At the time of trial, there was no issue concerning the respondent's ability 
  to pay spousal support. He had a successful medical practice in ophthalmology 
  and eye surgery and anticipated gross income for the year 2003 in the range 
  of $500,000 to $550,000. </p>
<p> [7] The Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Miglin had not yet been released 
  when the trial judge delivered her reasons. Applying this court's analysis in 
  Miglin<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>, the trial judge concluded that 
  the appellant had established a material change in circumstances subsequent 
  to the separation agreement but that, based on the principles set out in s. 
  15.2 of the Divorce Act, and considering the objective of finality reflected 
  in the separation agreement, in all of the circumstances, no order for support 
  was justified. </p>
<p>
  [8] Although the trial judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court of 
  Canada's decision in Miglin, in my view, her careful and extensive findings 
  are dispositive of the issues on appeal. </p>
<p> [9] Stage one of the Miglin analysis requires consideration of whether the 
  circumstances under which the agreement was negotiated and executed were satisfactory 
  and whether, at the time it was created, the agreement was in substantial compliance 
  with the Divorce Act, in order to determine whether there is any reason to "discount" 
  the separation agreement. Substantial compliance with the Divorce Act refers 
  not only to the spousal support considerations contained in s. 15.2 of the Divorce 
  Act, but also to the Act's more general objectives of certainty, finality, and 
  autonomy. <a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> </p>
<p> [10] In the early part of her reasons, the trial judge reviewed the circumstances 
  under which the separation agreement was negotiated. The trial judge noted that 
  both parties were independently represented by counsel and, in particular, that 
  following the appellant's return to Canada in 1992, "[t]here was no direct communication 
  between the parties and all communications between them occurred through their 
  counsel." <a href="#3">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> </p>
<p> [11] In addition, relying on evidence that the parties had exchanged sworn 
  financial statements, that the couple's two major assets were evaluated and 
  included in the financial statements, and that the respondent had given a direction 
  and authorization to his accountants to disclose his financial circumstances 
  to appellant's counsel which appeared to have been pursued, the trial judge 
  found that "at the time that the Agreement was entered into, both parties had 
  available to them full disclosure of the other party's financial circumstances."<a href="#4">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [12] Later, at paragraph 86 of her reasons, the trial judge considered the extent 
  to which the agreement complied, at the time it was created, with the objectives 
  in s. 15.2 of the Divorce Act and concluded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  On the facts of this case, I am satisfied that the interim Agreement of 1988, 
  together with the Separation Agreement of 1992 made by the parties and in the 
  context of their final property division, addressed the principles outlined 
  in section 15.2 of the Divorce Act. The respective economic advantages and disadvantages 
  to the spouses were recognized. The financial consequences arising from the 
  primary childcare function taken on by Ms. Marks during the marriage were specifically 
  addressed. After the separation, Mr. Tokarewicz took on this function together 
  with his exclusive financial responsibility for the care of the children so 
  that Ms. Marks could pursue her medical studies. The spousal support that Ms. 
  Marks received at the end of the marriage for a total of five and one-half years, 
  together with the cash payments that she received in the property settlement, 
  addressed, in a substantial and reasonable way, the economic hardship of Ms. 
  Marks arising from the breakdown of the marriage. It certainly provided her 
  with all of the financial assistance required to allow her to qualify to become 
  a medical doctor and, in that way become self-sufficient. It is evident &#133; 
  that the parties believed &#133; that Ms. Marks' self-sufficiency through her 
  qualification as a medical doctor was practicable. The finality of the Agreement 
  supports this conclusion. </p>
<p>
  [13] Finally, in paragraph 87 of her reasons, the trial judge found that the 
  terms of the spousal support release reflected "the parties' clear and 
  unequivocal intention to insulate the Agreement from review or variation". 
  </p>
<p>
  [14] I find no merit in the appellant's submission that the separation agreement 
  should be discounted under stage one of the Miglin analysis. In my view, the 
  trial judge's findings amply demonstrate that there is no basis for doing so 
  and the appellant failed to identify any reason for interfering with those findings.</p>
<p> [15] Stage two of the Miglin analysis requires an assessment "of the extent 
  to which enforcement of the agreement still reflects the original intention 
  of the parties and the extent to which it is still in substantial compliance 
  with the objectives of the Act."<a href="#5">[5]</a><a name="r5"></a> In my 
  view, the findings that led the trial judge to conclude that a support order 
  was not justified thoroughly address this issue. </p>
<p>
  [16] In accordance with this court's decision in Miglin, the trial judge began 
  her analysis of whether a support order should be made by determining whether 
  there had been a material change in circumstances. At paragraphs 76 and 78 of 
  her reasons, she concluded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133;the parties did not reasonably contemplate the fact that Ms. Marks would 
  not obtain her qualification to practice medicine in the time provided in the 
  Agreement.</p>
<p class="indent"> &#133;I am satisfied that, had it been known to the parties 
  in December 1991 that Ms. Marks financial difficulties, difficulties that materialized 
  almost immediately after the Separation Agreement was signed, would prevent 
  her from completing the final stage of her medical qualification, there would 
  have been a different result in the terms of the Agreement.</p>
<p>
  [17] Next, the trial judge considered whether a support order is justified under 
  the principles set out in s. 15.2 of the Divorce Act. As already noted, at paragraph 
  86 of her reasons, the trial judge concluded that, at the time it was signed, 
  the agreement "addressed the principles outlined in section 15.2". 
  Importantly, for the purposes of the stage two Miglin analysis, the trial judge 
  did not limit her consideration to the principles set out in s. 15.2 of the 
  Divorce Act. Rather, as already noted, at paragraph 87 of her reasons, she also 
  considered whether the separation agreement demonstrated the objective of finality 
  and concluded that the separation agreement displayed a clear intention that 
  it be final.</p>
<p>
  [18] The trial judge then summarized the chronology of events following the 
  appellant's return to Canada in 1994. In addition to the matters already referred 
  to, she noted that the appellant took no action to seek a review of the separation 
  agreement when she returned to Canada but rather attempted to become self-sufficient 
  through other employment. Significantly, at paragraph 89 of her reasons, the 
  trial judge found that the appellant's health problems are not preventing her 
  from working and that "to a significant degree, [the appellant's] present 
  circumstances arose as a result of choices and decisions that she alone made[emphasis 
  added]." The trial judge then concluded at paragraph 90 of her reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  To seek the supervisory jurisdiction of the court to award spousal support some 
  seven years and five months after the expiration of the time limit for her spousal 
  support is, on the facts of this case, too long. I am persuaded that to grant 
  such relief would cause prejudice to [the respondent] despite his clear and 
  evident ability to pay and [the appellant's] palpable need.</p>
<p>
  [19] Applying this court's analysis in Miglin, the trial judge determined that 
  there had been a material change in circumstances sufficient to trigger an inquiry 
  concerning whether a support order should be made. In doing so she specifically 
  addressed the question of whether the change she relied on was reasonably anticipated 
  by the parties. In reaching a decision, she recognized that, in the circumstances 
  which existed at the time of trial, the original intentions of the parties as 
  reflected in the separation agreement represented conflicting objectives, namely 
  autonomy, finality and certainty versus a plan for the equitable resolution 
  of the financial and property issues arising from the marriage and its breakdown, 
  including a plan for the appellant to achieve self sufficiency. Importantly 
  for the purposes of the stage two Miglin analysis, in determining whether a 
  support order should be made, the trial judge assessed the relative weight to 
  be afforded to those objectives at the time of trial in light of all of the 
  intervening events. In effect, the trial judge assessed "the extent to 
  which enforcement of the agreement still reflects the original intention of 
  the parties and the extent to which it is still in substantial compliance with 
  the objectives of the Act".</p>
<p>
  [20] Although the trial judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court 
  of Canada's reasons in Miglin, in my view, she thoroughly canvassed the factors 
  relevant to the stage two Miglin analysis and determined the issue of whether 
  a support order should be made in a manner consistent with that analysis. I 
  see no basis for interfering with her conclusion. </p>

<p>
  [21] The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs on a partial indemnity basis 
  fixed in the amount of $8,794 inclusive of disbursements and applicable G.S.T.
