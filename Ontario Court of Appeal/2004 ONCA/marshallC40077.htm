<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released orally: January 13, 2004</p>
<p>
  [1] After a day and a half trial the trial judge found that the appellant had 
  been constructively dismissed and awarded damages of $22,425.25. The Divisional 
  Court overturned the trial judge's finding that the appellant had been constructively 
  dismissed. The appellant obtained leave to appeal and appeals to this court.</p>
<p>
  [2] For eighteen years the 52-year old appellant worked in a small insurance 
  brokerage in Belleville, Ontario as a customer service representative. It was 
  a twenty-minute drive to the office from her home in Prince Edward County. She 
  was a reliable and trusted employee who basically ran the office. The only other 
  persons employed there were the broker and a receptionist. The plaintiff's annual 
  salary was $26,200.</p>
<p>
  [3] In March 1999 the appellant's employer was bought by the respondent, a large 
  insurance broker with a number of offices in different communities. The respondent 
  decided to offer the appellant employment in the same position at the same salary. 
  The respondent told the appellant that it proposed to close the small insurance 
  office located just north of Belleville and open a larger one in Belleville. 
  She agreed to this. </p>
<p>
  [4] In October 1999, the respondent (without consulting the appellant) advised 
  her that she was being transferred to a branch office in Colborne, Ontario. 
  Another person had been hired to perform her job in the Belleville office. The 
  Colborne office was a one-hour drive from the appellant's home. </p>
<p>
  [5] When the appellant objected to the transfer, the respondent wrote her a 
  letter impugning the quality of her work. The respondent wrote: </p>
<p class="indent"> I no longer have a position for you in the Belleville office, 
  since I want your work and work habits closely monitored. Your work has been 
  done slowly and you have a higher than normal error rate in entry. You fail 
  to recall previous events and conversations. Your ability to learn and use the 
  computer has progressed by an abnormally slow rate for someone with 20 years 
  of insurance experience and previous computer experience.</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, you have a position in Colborne. Your job there awaits 
  you on Monday, November 1, 1999 at 9:00 a.m. Failing to arrive there on Monday 
  will be interpreted as abandonment of your job, and interpreted as resigning 
  your position.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant was greatly upset by this letter. She did not report to her 
  new job in Colborne. Instead, she launched an action against the defendant, 
  seeking $25,000 in damages for constructive dismissal on the basis that it was 
  a term of her earlier employment contract that she would be employed in Belleville. 
  Prior to trial, the respondent withdrew the allegation that the appellant was 
  incompetent. The trial judge found in the appellant's favour.</p>
<p>
  [7] The Divisional Court allowed an appeal from that judgment. The Divisional 
  Court held, at paragraph 16 of its reasons, that &quot;There was no evidence 
  before the trial judge that it was a term of the employee's contract, either 
  express or implied, that she would work only in the Belleville office. It was 
  wrong for the trial judge to conclude as such. &quot;</p>
<p>
  [8] In our opinion the Divisional Court ought not to have overturned the trial 
  judge's decision. In his reasons, the trial judge adverted to the fact that 
  when the respondent purchased the business it told other prospective employees 
  that they could be required to work at other locations. It did not tell the 
  appellant this. In addition the trial judge found that when the insurance business 
  was sold to the respondent, and the respondent made an offer of employment to 
  the appellant, it was that the appellant's employment would be on the same terms 
  as her previous employment, including working in Belleville. Had the appellant 
  known that she would be transferred to Colborne, she could have refused the 
  offer of employment and received severance from her previous employer. The trial 
  judge was sensitive to this. It was open to the trial judge to conclude that 
  it was implicit that an essential term of the respondent's offer of employment 
  was the location of the workplace and that an essential term of her employment 
  contract was altered by the transfer to Colborne.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appeal is therefore allowed. We would also dismiss the cross-appeal. 
  It is not necessary to refer to the statutory deductions. The statutory obligations 
  remain and both parties acknowledge that. </p>
<p>
  [10] Costs to the appellant of the proceedings in the Divisional Court and in 
  this Court are fixed in the amount of $10,000 including GST. </p>
