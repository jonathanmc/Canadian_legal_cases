<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The applicant was committed for trial on first degree murder. His application 
  to quash the committal was dismissed. He now appeals the refusal to grant certiorari 
  to this court. He submits that the preliminary inquiry judge impermissibly weighed 
  the evidence or drew unreasonable inferences from the evidence on the issues 
  of specific intent, planning and deliberation. In oral argument he focussed 
  especially on the issue of deliberation and contended that there was a complete 
  absence of evidence showing that this was a &quot;deliberate murder&quot;. We 
  do not accept this submission. Instead, we agree with the reviewing justice 
  that the preliminary inquiry judge weighed the evidence only to the limited 
  extent permitted by the case law. </p>
<p>[2] The preliminary inquiry judge was faced with a body of circumstantial evidence, 
  especially the evidence of the poisoning allegations. He weighed that evidence 
  only to determine that it was capable of supporting the inferences sought by 
  the Crown, while acknowledging that it was also capable of supporting inferences 
  favourable to the accused. Moreover, in our view, the circumstantial evidence 
  amounts to at least a &quot;scintilla&quot; of evidence on each of the elements 
  of first degree murder, and from which the preliminary inquiry judge could form 
  the opinion that the accused should be tried on that charge. </p>
<p>[3] Specifically, on the issue of deliberation we think that the preliminary 
  inquiry judge correctly concluded that there was sufficient evidence, especially 
  from the accused's own statements, from which he could infer that the accused 
  planned the murder and then &quot;deliberated&quot; or waited for the opportunity 
  to commit it. </p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
