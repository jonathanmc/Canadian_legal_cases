<p>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice H.S. LaForme, of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated December 14, 1998.</p>
<p>DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p> [1] After a lengthy trial by judge and jury, the respondent was convicted 
  of several serious crimes, including four counts of attempted murder. The Crown 
  brought a dangerous offender application and argued in the alternative that 
  the respondent should be sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial judge dismissed 
  the dangerous offender application and concluded that sentences totalling 23 
  years were appropriate. After giving the respondent double credit for four years 
  and three months in pre-sentence custody (eight and a half years),<a name="r1"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> 
  the trial judge imposed sentences totalling 14 &frac12; years. </p>
<p>
  [2] The Crown appealed the dismissal of the dangerous offender application and 
  the sentences imposed. The respondent appealed the convictions. The Crown abandoned 
  its appeal from the dismissal of the dangerous offender application and the 
  respondent abandoned his appeal from the convictions. The Crown's sentence appeal 
  proceeded.</p>
<p>
  [3] On the sentence appeal, the Crown submitted that life imprisonment was the 
  only appropriate penalty. At the conclusion of oral argument, the court indicated 
  that leave to appeal sentence was granted and that the sentences would be varied 
  to life imprisonment. These are the reasons for that disposition.</p>
<p>
  THE OFFENCES</p>
<p>
  [4] On October 20, 1994, the respondent and an accomplice entered the Bank of 
  Montreal in the small town of Port Perry, Ontario. The respondent was armed 
  with a large black rifle and the accomplice had a handgun. The respondent began 
  shouting and demanding the cash. When the bank manager would not provide the 
  combination to the safe, the respondent shot him in the leg. The manager then 
  provided the combination. The respondent and his accomplice took the money and 
  left the bank. </p>
<p>
  [5] As the respondent and his cohort fled the bank on foot, P.C. Ellis and his 
  partner, P.C. McConkey arrived in their vehicle in response to a 911 call that 
  had been made by one of the bank employees. The respondent opened fire, shooting 
  Ellis in the head and face as the police vehicle approached. The bullet fragments 
  came to rest near Ellis's brain. The respondent also shot McConkey in the left 
  side of the face, blowing off part of his lower jaw before Officer McConkey 
  could exit the vehicle. </p>
<p>
  [6] A third police officer, Detective Mooy, stationed himself behind a pillar 
  hoping to get an opportunity to return fire. The respondent fired at Mooy's 
  chest, striking the officer in the arm and shattering the bone in two places. 
  </p>
<p>
  [7] The respondent fired some 30 rounds into the crowded plaza area outside 
  of the bank. One of the bullets struck Debra Taylor who was in her office across 
  the street from the bank. The bullet hit her in the back and arm. Bullet fragments 
  pierced her heart and came to rest near her lungs. </p>
<p>
  [8] The respondent and his accomplice fled the scene. About a half an hour later, 
  they broke into the residence of the Pierces, an elderly couple. They held Mrs. 
  Pierce prisoner awaiting the return of her husband. In the course of this confinement, 
  they waved a gun in Mrs. Pierce's face and threatened to use it. When Mr. Pierce 
  arrived home, the respondent and his accomplice forced Mr. Pierce at gunpoint 
  to drive them to their car parked in a nearby hospital parking lot. Mr. Pierce 
  was then released. When Mr. Pierce was forced to leave his home with the respondent 
  and the accomplice, Mrs. Pierce believed that she would never see her husband 
  alive again.</p>
<p>
  [9] The accomplice has not been brought to justice. The guns used by the respondent 
  and the accomplice and the money stolen from the bank have not been recovered. 
  </p>
<p>
  [10] In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge indicated that the respondent 
  had turned Port Perry "into a war zone" and inflicted "a reign 
  of terror on the citizens of Port Perry". He described the shooting of 
  the bank manager as "cold and calculated". He observed that those 
  in the bank feared for their lives and were terrorized by the respondent's conduct.</p>
<p>
  [11] The trial judge's description of the events outside the bank bears repeating: </p>
<p class="indent"> Outside the bank Mr. McArthur and his accomplice were encountered 
  by the arrival of police officers who were responding to the robbery. It's at 
  this time that Mr. McArthur, and again I'm satisfied that the evidence totally 
  supports this, opened fire on the police officers with a Steyr-Aug military 
  assault rifle. This weapon is an Austrian made semi-automatic military weapon 
  that holds a 30 round magazine that fires its bullets as fast as the trigger 
  can be pulled. Expert evidence on this was that the purpose for which the weapon 
  is manufactured is to kill, and that the bullets travel at three times the speed 
  of sound, and are devastating when they hit. The evidence is clear the magazine 
  was emptied at the police officers by Mr. McArthur. Further, I am satisfied 
  the evidence further establishes that Mr. McArthur was shooting at the heads 
  of the officers, and that he intended to do so. The expert's evidence of devastation 
  turned out to be exact. Constables Warren Ellis and Mark McConkey, and Detective 
  Paul Mooy, suffered serious and permanent injuries as a result. Again, their 
  impact statements bear witness to the extent of both the physical injuries and 
  the understandable emotional problems that followed and to some extent continue.</p>
<p class="indent">As if tragedy wasn't enough, one of the bullets from Mr. McArthur's 
  killing tool found its way into the office of an innocent civilian doing nothing 
  more than working late in her honest efforts to make a living. She too was nearly 
  killed, and her physical and mental well-being has been permanently altered.</p>
<p> [12] The trial judge imposed the following concurrent sentences arising out 
  of the bank robbery.</p>
<ul>
  <li>the aggravated assault on Mr. Knight, the bank manager - 8 years (count 
    5);</li>
  <li>the robbery - 14 years (count 6);</li>
  <li>the use of a handgun during a robbery - 5 years (count 7);</li>
  <li>being masked while committing a robbery - 3 years (count 10);</li>
  <li>use of a rifle during a robbery - 5 years (count 11); and</li>
  <li>possession of a 30 round magazine - 3 years (count 12);</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [13] The trial judge imposed concurrent sentences of 17 years on each of the 
  attempted murder charges (counts 1 to 4). These sentences were made concurrent 
  to the sentences imposed on the charges arising out of the bank robbery.</p>
<p> [14] The trial judge imposed the following sentences for the offences involving 
  the Pierces: </p>
<ul>
  <li>forcible confinement of Mrs. Pierce - 6 years (count 13);</li>
  <li>kidnapping of Mr. Pierce - 6 years (count 15);</li>
  <li>use of a weapon to confine the Pierces - 5 years (count 16); and</li>
  <li>being masked during a kidnapping - 3 years (count 17);</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [15] The sentences on the counts arising out of the confinement and kidnapping 
  of the Pierces were made concurrent to each other, but consecutive to the other 
  sentences.</p>
<p>
  [16] As indicated above, the sentences imposed by the trial judge totalled 23 
  years, he then, however, reduced those sentences by 8 &frac12; years to take 
  into account 4 years and 3 months pre-sentence custody.</p>
<p>
  THE IMPACT ON THE VICTIMS</p>
<p>
  [17] The victims of the respondent's violence have suffered devastating physical 
  and emotional consequences. Mr. Knight, the bank manager, underwent many weeks 
  of extensive physiotherapy and still has difficulty with his knee. At least 
  two of the other individuals who were in the bank were terrorized and continue 
  to suffer significant emotional distress.</p>
<p>
  [18] P.C. Ellis, the first officer who was shot, underwent six hours of brain 
  surgery. He was off duty for five months and after returning to duty suffered 
  from anxiety believing that he would be shot again. He continues to suffer migraine 
  headaches. </p>
<p>
  [19] P.C. McConkey, the second officer shot by the respondent, was airlifted 
  to hospital in Toronto. His jaw was wired shut for five weeks and he had great 
  difficulty eating or sleeping. Complications developed and he had to undergo 
  further surgery in January 1995. He has also undergone a long course of dental 
  treatment to prepare for dental implants. In 1996, he underwent plastic surgery 
  to repair scarring on his face. At the time of sentencing, he continued to be 
  in discomfort 24 hours a day. He took medication daily. Officer McConkey could 
  only eat small portions of food that sometimes have to be cut up for him. It 
  is anticipated that he will need more surgery.</p>
<p>
  [20] Detective Mooy, the third officer shot by the respondent, needed three 
  operations to repair the damage to his arm. He underwent two years of intensive 
  physical therapy. For some time he could not feed or bathe himself. He has been 
  able to return to work but there is still some deficit in his co-ordination 
  and his arm is significantly disfigured. </p>
<p>
  [21] Ms. Taylor, the realtor who was shot by the stray bullet fired by the respondent, 
  has suffered incredibly as a result of the respondent's actions. She lost the 
  use of her right arm for four months and required extensive physiotherapy. During 
  her convalescence, Ms. Taylor became addicted to prescription painkillers. Although 
  she had a thriving business prior to the shooting, she was unable to sell real 
  estate for almost two years after she was shot by the respondent. Eventually, 
  Ms. Taylor had to declare bankruptcy and spent time living in a women's shelter 
  in Oshawa. She became dependent upon welfare. </p>
<p>
  [22] Ms. Taylor was hospitalized for post-traumatic stress syndrome and attempted 
  suicide on several occasions. In May 1995, while driving her vehicle, Ms. Taylor 
  heard a radio broadcast which discussed the respondent and the Port Perry robbery. 
  She became so upset that she drove her vehicle into the back of a parked car. 
  Ms. Taylor required hospitalization. She eventually had a complete mental breakdown 
  and had to be cared for by her brother. </p>
<p>
  [23] In December 1996, Ms. Taylor slowly began to rebuild her life. By the time 
  of sentencing in December 1998, Ms. Taylor was still suffering from periodic 
  pain, a weak right arm, and distorted hearing. She was, however, back at work 
  as a real estate agent. </p>
<p>
  [24] In her victim impact statement, Mrs. Pierce indicated that when the respondent 
  and his accomplice broke into her home, she experienced a shock unlike anything 
  she had ever experienced. When they took her husband, she believed that she 
  would never see her husband alive again. Mrs. Pierce and her husband have since 
  relocated. </p>
<p>
  THE OFFENDER</p>
<p>
  [25] The respondent was 47 years old at the time of sentencing. He is single 
  and has no children.</p>
<p>
  [26] The respondent's criminal record consists of 134 criminal convictions beginning 
  in 1968 when he was 17 years of age and continuing without interruption to the 
  commission of these offences. Between 1968 and 1973, the respondent was convicted 
  of approximately 100 different offences, including many break-ins. Most of the 
  offences were property related. He received his first penitentiary sentence 
  in June of 1973. </p>
<p>
  [27] The respondent's criminal activities have become increasingly violent since 
  1973. He was convicted of armed robbery in August 1973 and was convicted of 
  five more armed bank robberies before he committed these offences in October 
  1994. In June 1987, the respondent received sentences totalling 12 years for 
  three of the armed robberies and related offences. The respondent was released 
  in June 1994 after serving some seven years. He committed these offences about 
  three months after his release. </p>
<p>
  [28] The trial judge heard evidence concerning some of the respondent's prior 
  offences. His conviction for assault causing bodily harm in 1978 involved the 
  shooting of a police officer who was attempting to arrest the respondent. The 
  respondent was charged with aggravated assault, but convicted of assault causing 
  bodily harm on the basis that he had not intentionally fired the gun at the 
  police officer. </p>
<p>
  [29] In 1990, the respondent, while he was in the penitentiary, wrote a book 
  about his criminal adventures entitled, "I'd Rather Be Wanted than Had". 
  He also gave various interviews promoting the book. In his book and interviews, 
  he made it clear that in his mind the officer he shot was to blame for his own 
  injury. He said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There's been no need to disarm. He could have just let me go. But he wanted 
  to play hero. </p>
<p>
  [30] The 1986 conviction for armed robbery arose out of a carefully planned 
  robbery of a bank in Hepworth, Ontario in 1983. In the course of making their 
  getaway, the respondent and his accomplice fired shots at a truck that was pursuing 
  them. Luckily, no one was hurt, although a stray bullet almost struck an elderly 
  lady standing in the doorway of her home. At the time of sentencing on this 
  conviction, the respondent told the trial judge that he was going to "put 
  an end to my life of crime".</p>
<p>
  [31] The three armed robberies for which the respondent was convicted in June 
  1987, occurred between November 1984 and January 1986 in western Canada. The 
  respondent was armed while committing all of the robberies. No one was hurt. 
  </p>
<p>
  [32] Dr. Steven Hucker, a psychiatrist, testified on the dangerous offender 
  hearing. He had prepared a report under s. 752.1 of the Criminal Code. Dr. Hucker 
  described McArthur as suffering from an anti-social personality disorder of 
  long standing. He had a complete lack of concern for other people. The respondent 
  also had a narcissistic personality. These personality features could be a predictor 
  of violent recidivism, although not necessarily a strong predictor. Dr. Hucker 
  testified that the best predictor of future behaviour was past behaviour. Dr. 
  Hucker performed various tests in an attempt to quantify the risk of the respondent 
  re-offending. He concluded that actuarially there was, at a minimum, a 44 percent 
  risk that the respondent would re-offend in the next seven years in a violent 
  manner. This rating was similar to that achieved by many other federal inmates. 
  </p>
<p>
  [33] In his testimony, Dr. Hucker observed that McArthur's criminal record was 
  the reverse of what one would normally expect. His criminal activity was becoming 
  more violent as he grew older. In Dr. Hucker's opinion, the respondent's criminal 
  record showed an increasing resort to violence, an inability and refusal to 
  control aggression and an indifference to the suffering of victims. According 
  to Dr. Hucker, the respondent minimized the extent of his aggression and chose 
  to portray himself as a "gentleman thief". </p>
<p>
  [34] There was no indication that McArthur had benefited from any treatment 
  or program that had been available to him. Dr. Hucker was also unaware of any 
  treatment or program that could assist the respondent given his attitude. Dr. 
  Hucker could only say, that like any other criminal, the respondent's criminal 
  activity would decrease at some point as he grew older. Dr. Hucker could not 
  say when this would occur. </p>
<p>
  [35] The respondent is described as an intelligent person, although as the trial 
  judge observed, he has never used that intelligence for anything other than 
  "brutish criminal behaviour".</p>
<p>
  THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [36] On a sentence appeal, this court must show deference to the sentence imposed 
  by the trial judge. Appellate intervention is justified only where reasons for 
  sentence reflect a material error in principle, or where the appellate court 
  is satisfied that the sentence imposed is clearly excessive or inadequate: R. 
  v. M.(C.A.) (1996), 1 S.C.R. 500; R. v. Rezaie (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 
  102-103 (Ont. C.A.). That deference is well earned, where, as in this case, 
  the trial judge's reasons reflect a careful and thorough review of the factors 
  relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence. </p>
<p>
  [37] We are satisfied, however, that the reasons for sentence reveal a material 
  error in principle. In rejecting the Crown's contention that the respondent 
  should be sentenced to life imprisonment, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [I]n considering such a sentence, I must be mindful of the legal principle that 
  a life sentence is always reserved for the worst offences committed by the worst 
  of offenders. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [38] The trial judge went on to limit the availability of a life sentence to 
  offences that demonstrated "unusual features of brutality or cruelty or 
  offences that were part of a violent pattern of behaviour which threatened the 
  safety of others."</p>
<p>
  [39] This court has rejected the "worst offence/worst offender" characterization 
  as a necessary precondition to the imposition of a life sentence. In R. v. Mesgun 
  (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 439 (Ont. C.A.), the court upheld a life sentence imposed 
  on a first offender who had attempted to murder his former girlfriend in a particularly 
  brutal and savage manner. The court said at p. 443: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Moreover, it would, in our view, be unwise to straight jacket the sentencing 
  process by requiring the maximum sentence be imposed only in a case of the worst 
  offence committed by the worst offender. As Lamer C.J.C. said in R. v. M.(C.A.) 
  [citation omitted]: 'sentencing is an inherently individualized process'. This 
  process is surely best served by an approach hallmarked by flexibility rather 
  than rigidity. </p>
<p>
  [40] In Mesgun, the court concluded that the nature of the offence fully justified 
  a life sentence even though the offender could not be characterized as "the 
  worst offender".</p>
<p>
  [41] The danger of the worst offence/worst offender approach to the sentencing 
  of offenders like the respondent is that it moves the focus away from a detailed 
  examination of the specific offences committed by the specific offender to a 
  comparison of the offender's crimes and background with those of the hypothetical 
  worst offender who has committed the hypothetical worst offence. Human behaviour 
  being what it is, it is always possible to imagine a worse case.</p>
<p>
  [42] Having found a material error in principle in the trial judge's reasons, 
  it falls to this court to determine a fit sentence: R. v. Rezaie, supra, at 
  103.</p>
<p>
  [43] Section 718 of the Criminal Code identifies the fundamental purpose of 
  sentencing as being: </p>
<p class="indent">
  To contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law 
  and maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions 
  &#133;</p>
<p>
  [44] That purpose is achieved by blending the various objectives of sentencing 
  identified in s. 718. The proper blending of those objectives depends on the 
  nature of the offence and the nature of the offender. In this case, the objectives 
  of denunciation and specific deterrence must dominate almost to the exclusion 
  of the other objectives recognized in s. 718.</p>
<p>
  [45] Section 718.1 also directs that the sentence imposed must fit the offence 
  and the offender. Sentences that may otherwise serve the fundamental purpose 
  of sentencing and the objectives underlying that purpose cannot be justified 
  unless they are proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the offender's 
  personal culpability.</p>
<p>
  [46] In determining whether life imprisonment is a fit sentence, one must look 
  at the entirety of the respondent's criminal conduct. The bank robbery and related 
  shooting, the carnage in the plaza outside of the bank and the confinement of 
  the Pierces, considered individually were all very serious crimes of violence 
  involving the use or threatened use of deadly force against completely innocent 
  victims. Considered in isolation from each other, all would merit lengthy penitentiary 
  terms. The proportionality principle demands that the sentences ultimately imposed 
  reflect the gravity of all of the offences and the respondent's responsibility 
  for all of the offences. Totality considerations may of course moderate the 
  cumulative sentence in appropriate cases: Criminal Code s. 718.2(c).</p>
<p>
  [47] Without diminishing the seriousness of any of the crimes committed by the 
  respondent, it can be safely said that the four attempted murder convictions 
  are the most serious crimes. Under our law, a person can only be convicted of 
  attempted murder if he or she intended to kill. The moral culpability of the 
  attempted murderer is at least equal to that of a murderer. He or she avoids 
  a murder conviction and the automatic sentence of life imprisonment not because 
  of any mitigating factor, but because through good fortune, the victim was not 
  killed. </p>
<p>
  [48] A conviction for attempted murder will almost inevitably result in a lengthy 
  penitentiary term. These attempted murders are particularly egregious. They 
  occurred in the course of the respondent's flight after committing serious crimes. 
  There were four victims, all of whom were seriously hurt and continue to suffer 
  significant adverse effects from the shooting. The respondent used a particularly 
  dangerous weapon which on the evidence was "manufactured to kill". 
  The shootings were obviously the result of a considered decision by the respondent 
  to use deadly force if he met any resistance from the police. These shooting 
  were the product of a careful plan implemented with deadly detachment and efficiency. 
  Only sheer good luck foiled the respondent's desire to kill those who would 
  try to stop him. </p>
<p>
  [49] As indicated above, the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society 
  is the fundamental purpose of sentencing. Police officers play a unique and 
  crucial role in promoting and preserving a just, peaceful and safe society. 
  We rely on the police to put themselves in harm's way to protect the community 
  from the criminal element. At the same time, we rely on the police to act with 
  restraint in the execution of their duties and to avoid the use of any force, 
  much less deadly force, unless clearly necessary. Violent attacks upon police 
  officers who are doing their duty are attacks on the rule of law and on the 
  safety and well-being of the community as a whole. Sentences imposed for those 
  attacks must reflect the vulnerability of the police officers, society's dependence 
  on the police, and society's determination to avoid a policing mentality which 
  invites easy resort to violence in the execution of the policing function: R. 
  v. Forrest (1986), 15 O.A.C. 104 at 107 (C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [50] The murder of a police officer acting in the execution of his duty attracts 
  the highest penalty our law permits: Criminal Code s. 231(4)(a). The respondent 
  did everything within his power to commit that crime.</p>
<p>
  [51] Thankfully, the use of deadly force against police officers by those seeking 
  to avoid capture is relatively rare in Ontario, as is the use of deadly force 
  by police officers against fleeing felons. Counsel could not recall any other 
  case in this Province where an individual seeking to avoid capture attempted 
  to murder and seriously wounded three police officers. We are also unaware of 
  any such case. We cannot think of a more serious case of attempted murder than 
  the shooting of these three police officers.</p>
<p>
  [52] The seriousness of all of the offences committed by the respondent, particularly 
  the attempted murders, and his high level of personal culpability in each and 
  every one of these offences points strongly to life imprisonment as the appropriate 
  sentence. </p>
<p>
  [53] A consideration of the offender's background and character strengthens 
  the argument in favour of a life sentence. The respondent is a lifetime incorrigible 
  criminal. Since the mid-seventies, he has been a violent criminal. His six prior 
  armed robberies involved the use of a loaded weapon. In one case, the weapon 
  was fired at a pursuing vehicle. He has used a weapon in the past to resist 
  arrest leading to a serious injury to the arresting officer. In the almost 20 
  years leading up to these offences, the respondent has either been in jail serving 
  sentences for violent crimes or at large committing violent crimes. There is 
  no good reason to think that he will not commit further violent crimes if given 
  the opportunity to do so. He is a dangerous person. </p>
<p>
  [54] Nothing in the material before the trial judge suggests any factors which 
  could reasonably mitigate the bleak picture painted by the respondent's criminal 
  background and the circumstances of these offences. He was motivated entirely 
  by greed. He shows no remorse and no insight into the harm done to his victims. 
  His book written in 1990 and public statements made in connection with the book 
  suggest moral values and a sense of personal entitlement having much more in 
  common with a Hollywood movie script than the realities of our community. Clearly, 
  the respondent is ready to commit violent crimes to get money and is willing 
  to kill those who try to stop him.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [55] As indicated at the conclusion of oral argument, leave to appeal is granted 
  and the sentences are varied to life imprisonment. To effect that result, we 
  vary the sentences on each of the attempted murder counts to life imprisonment. 
  By law, those sentences must run concurrently. We would not alter the length 
  of the sentences imposed on the other charges, however, again by operation of 
  law, those sentences must run concurrently with the life sentences imposed on 
  the attempted murder charges. </p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> On appeal, the Crown argued that most 
  of the pre-sentence incarceration arose out of the revocation of the respondent&#146;s 
  parole and that he should not have received credit for that part of his pre-sentence 
  incarceration. The Crown sought to adduce fresh evidence in support of this
