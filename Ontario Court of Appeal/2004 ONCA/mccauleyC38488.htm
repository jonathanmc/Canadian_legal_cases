<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals his sentence of nine years for sexual assault. The 
  trial judge rejected the Crown&#8217;s application to have the appellant declared 
  a dangerous offender, instead declared him a long-term offender, and imposed 
  a nine year sentence for the predicate offence.</p>
<p> [2] The appellant is 42 years old and has five prior convictions for sexual 
  assault, including one on the same little girl whom he assaulted in this case. 
</p>
<p> [3] The trial judge was faced with a very difficult sentencing decision. She 
  explained that the sentence she imposed, which only gave one for one credit 
  for pre-trial custody and was two years more than the sentence the Crown suggested, 
  was given in order to try to ensure that the appellant would receive the sex 
  offender treatment program while in custody. The ability to be treated and released 
  into society was the main reason for imposing the long-term offender rather 
  than the dangerous offender designation.</p>
<p> [4] The appellant is scheduled to commence that program in early June. If 
  he completes it successfully, he will be eligible for consideration for parole 
  by the parole board at that time. </p>
<p> [5] We see no error in principle in the disposition imposed by the trial judge 
  in this case. We would therefore not interfere with the sentence imposed. Leave 
  to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
