<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In October 1999 Melissa McClintock went to Cassidy's Bar on Danforth Avenue 
  where Patricia Banks and Kirsty O'Shea were also present. O'Shea had injuries 
  from a previous weekend, and informed Banks that it was McClintock who had injured 
  her. They told McClintock to leave the bar. McClintock left taking a beer bottle 
  with her. Banks followed her outside. McClintock smashed the beer bottle on 
  a railing and struck Banks in the face with it once. She was charged with assault 
  with a weapon and the Crown proceeded summarily before Justice Wolski of the 
  Ontario Court of Justice. He convicted her and sentenced her to 4 months imprisonment. 
  McClintock appealed. The appeal against conviction was dismissed without reasons, 
  but the appeal against sentence was allowed, and McClintock's sentence was varied 
  to 90 days intermittent. She has served a total of nine days in custody. She 
  appeals against conviction and sentence. </p>
<p>
  [2] We are of the opinion that the conviction appeal must succeed because of 
  the combined effect of two errors by the trial judge: his misapprehension of 
  the evidence and his misapplication of W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.</p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge misapprehended the evidence concerning Banks' threats and 
  the appellant's state of mind when she left the bar. He minimized the evidence 
  of Banks' threats to the appellant in the bar by referring to it as name calling 
  and uttering &quot;harsh words&quot;. This was a mischaracterization of Banks' 
  evidence as Kelly, the bartender, whose evidence the trial judge otherwise accepted, 
  testified in chief that Banks had uttered a threat towards the appellant and 
  said she was &quot;going to get her&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge also unjustifiably rejected the evidence of the appellant 
  that she left the bar in fear for her safety. The reason he said she was not 
  in fear when she left was because she left the bar alone and did not wait for 
  her cousin who was with her that night. The cousin testified that he went downstairs 
  to call a taxi and when he could not find a telephone he went to the bar and 
  asked for the police to be called. In these circumstances, the trial judge should 
  not have inferred the appellant was not afraid because she did not wait for 
  her cousin. Instead, having regard to the threat, the evidence is more consistent 
  with the opposite conclusion. </p>
<p>
  [5] A central issue in the trial was Banks' motivation in following the appellant 
  outside the bar and whether the appellant acted because she feared she was in 
  danger of imminent bodily harm. The trial judge ignored circumstantial evidence 
  that impacted upon the motivation of Banks and O'Shea. </p>
<p>
  [6] In addition, as the Crown concedes, the trial judge misstated the burden 
  of proof. He misstated the second branch of the W. (D.) test by employing the 
  wording &quot;could not reasonably be true&quot; in rejecting the appellant's 
  evidence as opposed to whether he was &quot;left in reasonable doubt&quot; by 
  her evidence. </p>
<p>
  [7] In the circumstances, the combination of these two errors requires that 
  we order a new trial. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is 
  set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>
