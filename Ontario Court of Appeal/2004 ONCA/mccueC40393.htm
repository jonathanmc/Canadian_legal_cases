<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Although we have serious concerns with the analysis that led the trial 
  judge to conclude that Mr. Peltier's evidence was both credible and reliable, 
  taking into account those facts found by the trial judge that are not contested 
  and applying s. 41 of the Criminal Code, we would not interfere with the conviction. 
</p>
<p>[2] As the appellant candidly concedes, at the very least, he was trespassing. 
  In refusing to leave when asked and putting up physical resistance, he was engaged 
  in an unlawful assault. That being so, on any realistic view of the evidence, 
  it is apparent to us that Mr. Peltier and the appellant went over the balcony 
  in tandem. As such, the necessary element of causation for the offence of aggravated 
  assault is made out. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal from conviction.</p>
<p>[4] With respect to sentence, based on the fresh evidence and the manner in 
  which the injury to Mr. Peltier was caused, we think that the sentence should 
  be varied. The appellant has now been in custody for eighteen months. According 
  to the fresh evidence, he has made significant progress. In the circumstances, 
  we are all of the view that the sentence should be varied to one of time served 
  plus probation for two years on terms and conditions agreed to by the parties 
  and approved by the court.</p>
