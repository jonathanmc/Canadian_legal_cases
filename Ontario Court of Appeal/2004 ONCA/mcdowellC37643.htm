<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Arthur C. Whealy of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated January 30, 2002, committing the appellant for surrender to 
  the United States of America.</p>
<p>MOLDAVER J.A.: </p>
<p> [1] The appellant Michael McDowell appeals from the order of Whealy J., dated 
  January 30, 2002, committing him for surrender to the United States of America 
  in respect of the following offence specified in the Authority to Proceed: Conspiracy 
  to launder the proceeds of an offence under the Controlled Drugs and Substances 
  Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19, contrary to s. 9(1) of that Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the 
  Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The appellant raises four grounds of appeal. 
  Of these, three can be dealt with summarily. </p>
<p> GROUNDS OF APPEAL</p>
<p>Three Miscellaneous Grounds </p>
<p> [2] First, the appellant's constitutional attack on s. 32 of the Extradition 
  Act, S.C. 1999, c. 18 and related provisions fails for the reasons given by 
  this court in the United States of America v. Yang (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 52 (C.A.).</p>
<p> [3] Second, there is no merit in the appellant's submission that the record 
  of the case was falsely certified because it states that the evidence summarized 
  in it, including evidence from a confidential informant, is available at trial. 
  The appellant has not provided any evidence to contradict that statement. He 
  merely speculates that the informant may choose to remain anonymous and not 
  testify. That is not a basis for doubting the veracity of the certification.</p>
<p> [4] His further submission that the informant's evidence should be excised 
  from the record because it is inherently unreliable also fails: See Yang, supra, 
  at paras. 49 and 50.</p>
<p> [5] Finally, for the reasons of this court in United States of America v. 
  Patrick Manningham (File No. C33598), released concurrently, I would not give 
  effect to the appellant's submission that the extradition judge erred in failing 
  to consider whether the conduct summarized in the record of the case supported 
  not only the offence identified in the Authority to Proceed but the offence 
  or offences identified in the foreign indictment as well. I would also reject 
  the appellant's submission that the evidence in the record of the case does 
  not support the offence of conspiracy to launder the proceeds of crime specified 
  in the Authority to Proceed. The extradition judge found that the evidence was 
  sufficient to implicate the appellant and his co-conspirator Jeffrey Burns in 
  a "continuing conspiracy &#133; to launder drug proceeds supplied by the affiant 
  [Detective Wilfredo Hernandez of the Fort Lauderdale City Police Department]". 
  That finding was open to him and there is no basis for interfering with it.</p>
<p> Ground Four</p>
<p> (a) Was the appellant properly identified as the person sought for extradition?</p>
<p> [6] With those issues off the table, the only ground of appeal left for consideration 
  is whether the record of the case contains admissible evidence identifying the 
  appellant as the person sought for extradition. The answer to that question 
  hinges on the interpretation of s. 32 of the Act, which reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 32. (1) Subject to subsection (2), evidence that would otherwise 
  be admissible under Canadian law shall be admitted as evidence at an extradition 
  hearing. The following shall also be admitted as evidence, even if it would 
  not otherwise be admissible under Canadian law: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the contents of the documents contained in the record of 
  the case certified under subsection 33(3);</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the contents of the documents that are submitted in conformity 
  with the terms of an extradition agreement; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) evidence adduced by the person sought for extradition that 
  is relevant to the tests set out in subsection 29(1) if the judge considers 
  it reliable.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Evidence gathered in Canada must satisfy the rules of evidence 
  under Canadian law in order to be admitted.</p>
<p>[7] The particular issue to be decided is whether under s. 32(2), identification 
  evidence gathered in Canada and otherwise admissible under Canadian law can 
  be admitted as part of the record of the case. The appellant submits that it 
  cannot. He points to s. 32(2) and maintains that in this case, given the nature 
  of the evidence relied upon to establish his identity (first hand observations 
  made by Detective Hernandez upon the appellant's arrest in Canada), to "satisfy 
  the rules of evidence under Canadian law", that evidence must take the form 
  of viva voce testimony presented at the extradition hearing.</p>
<p> [8] For reasons that follow, I do not agree with that submission. On the contrary, 
  I am satisfied that the identification evidence presented by Detective Hernandez 
  in the record of the case was admissible and properly received. </p>
<p> (b) Identification evidence of Detective Hernandez</p>
<p> [9] In the record of the case, Detective Hernandez asserted that on March 
  29, 2000, he was present at RCMP headquarters when the appellant was apprehended 
  on a provisional arrest warrant. He further asserted that after the appellant 
  was allowed to call a legal aid duty counsel, the appellant was introduced to 
  him. Each acknowledged recognizing the other's voice from previous telephone 
  conversations. Detective Hernandez then provided a physical description of the 
  appellant and he noted that while being processed, the appellant offered "personal 
  biographical and identifying information confirming that he was the same Michael 
  McDowell referred to in the indictment, the arrest warrant, and herein." Finally, 
  as part of the record of the case, Detective Hernandez identified a photograph 
  of the appellant (attachment B of the record) "taken after his arrest in Canada 
  on March 29, 2000".</p>
<p> [10] That is the identification evidence in issue. The respondent concedes 
  that it was gathered in Canada. The appellant concedes that Detective Hernandez 
  could have given that evidence had he been called as a witness at the appellant's 
  extradition hearing. In other words, as viva voce evidence, it was properly 
  admissible and served to identify the appellant as the person sought for extradition.</p>
<p> [11] I agree with these concessions. In the case of the appellant, I would 
  simply add that, regardless of his concession, there is no basis for suggesting 
  that the evidence in question was gathered unlawfully or that it was otherwise 
  inadmissible under Canadian law. Accordingly, the debate boils down to the form 
  in which the evidence was presented.</p>
<p> [12] In oral argument, Mr. Reynolds, for the respondent, acknowledged that 
  s. 32(2) governs the admission of the identification evidence provided by Detective 
  Hernandez. In other words, he accepts that s. 32(2) applies to evidence gathered 
  in Canada that is contained in a record of the case where such record would 
  otherwise be admissible under s. 32(1)(a) of the Act. That is the conclusion 
  which Juriansz J. reached in United States of America v. Martinez, [2000] O.T.C. 
  131 (Sup. Ct.). At paras. 11 and 12 of his reasons, Juriansz J. analyzed the 
  issue as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Counsel for the extradition partner argued that s-s. 32(2) 
  had no application to information in a certified record of the case. She pointed 
  out that there are two sentences in s-s. 32(1) and she contended that the opening 
  limiting words of the subsection, i.e. "subject to subsection (2) &#133;" applied 
  only to the first sentence and s-s. 32(2) had no limiting effect on the second 
  sentence. I find such a construction tortuous. In my view the French version 
  of s-s. 32(1) puts the matter beyond doubt. The French version is comprised 
  of only one sentence and the use of "ainsi que" makes clear that subsection 
  (1) is to be read in totality.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> </p>
<p class="indent">I conclude, as a matter of statutory construction, that s-s. 
  32(2) applies to evidence gathered in Canada that is contained in a record of 
  the case that would otherwise be admissible under para. 32(1)(a) [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [13] That construction of s. 32 would appear to be at odds with LaForme J.'s 
  construction of the same provision in United States of America v. deBarros, 
  [2000] O.J. No. 5664 (Ont. Sup. Ct.). In deBarros, LaForme J. held that affidavits 
  provided by Canadian police officers in Buffalo, New York, which contained evidence 
  gathered in Canada and which formed part of the record of the case were admissible 
  under s. 32(1)(b) of the Act because they had been authorized in accordance 
  with Article 10(2) of the Extradition Treaty between Canada and the United States 
  of America, Can. T.S. 1976 No. 3, which reads: </p>
<p class="indent"> Article 10(2)</p>
<p class="indent">The documentary evidence in support of a request for extradition 
  or copies of these documents shall be admitted in evidence in the examination 
  of the request for extradition when &#133; in the case of a request emanating 
  from the United States, they are authenticated by an officer of the Department 
  of State of the United States and are certified by the principal diplomatic 
  or consular officer of Canada in the United States.</p>
<p> [14] In other words, LaForme J. was of the view that so long as the requirements 
  of s. 32(1)(b) were met, it mattered not that the authenticated documents contained 
  evidence gathered in Canada that would not otherwise be admissible under Canadian 
  law. In such circumstances, it was his view that s. 32(2) did not apply.</p>
<p> [15] In view of the respondent's concession that s. 32(2) does apply to the 
  identification evidence provided by Detective Hernandez, it is technically unnecessary 
  to resolve the Martinez/deBarros conflict. That said, I believe it would be 
  best to put the matter to rest. Respectfully, I find Juriansz J.'s analysis compelling 
  and I am satisfied that Martinez properly states the law. In addition to the 
  reasons given by Juriansz J., I would simply observe that as a matter of statutory 
  interpretation, this is a clear case in which the general provisions in s. 32(1) 
  must yield to the specific provision in s. 32(2). Moreover, I am satisfied that 
  the Martinez construction is consistent with the policy and legal considerations 
  (discussed below at paragraphs 17 through 23) that inform the meaning of s. 
  32(2).</p>
<p> (c) Was Detective Hernandez's identification evidence admissible in the form 
  in which it was presented?</p>
<p> [16] That then brings me to the pivotal issue - does Detective Hernandez's 
  identification evidence satisfy the rules of evidence under Canadian law? As 
  indicated, that issue depends on whether s. 32(2) is concerned with form and 
  substance, as the appellant submits, or just substance, as the respondent submits.</p>
<p> [17] I have no difficulty resolving that dispute in favour of the respondent. 
  As a matter of policy, I reject the appellant's position. To give effect to 
  it would be to allow form to triumph over substance and lead to expensive, time-consuming 
  hearings that would disable Canada from complying with its international obligations 
  in a prompt and efficient manner: see United States of America v. Dynar, [1997] 
  2 S.C.R. 462 at para. 122. </p>
<p> [18] In addition to policy considerations, the appellant's position is not 
  sound in law for several reasons. </p>
<p> [19] First, as my colleague Rosenberg J.A. explained in Yang at para. 46, 
  of the various principles of fundamental justice that apply in the extradition 
  context, the "form of evidence" presented at the hearing is not one.</p>
<p> [20] Second, the relevant provisions of the Act do not support the position 
  advocated by the appellant. Section 33 of the Act speaks to the contents of 
  the record of the case. It reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 33. (1) The record of the case must include</p>
<p class="indent">(a) in the case of a person sought for the purpose of prosecution, 
  a document summarizing the evidence available to the extradition partner for 
  use in the prosecution; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) in the case of a person sought for the imposition or enforcement 
  of a sentence,</p>
<p class="indent">(i) a copy of the document that records the conviction of the 
  person, and</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) a document describing the conduct for which the person 
  was convicted.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) A record of the case may include other relevant documents, 
  including documents respecting the identification of the person sought for extradition.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) A record of the case may not be admitted unless</p>
<p class="indent">(a) in the case of a person sought for the purpose of prosecution, 
  a judicial or prosecuting authority of the extradition partner certifies that 
  the evidence summarized or contained in the record of the case is available 
  for trial and</p>
<p class="indent">(i) is sufficient under the law of the extradition partner to 
  justify prosecution, or</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) was gathered according to the law of the extradition partner; 
  or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) in the case of a person sought for the imposition or enforcement 
  of a sentence, a judicial, prosecuting or correctional authority of the extradition 
  partner certifies that the documents in the record of the case are accurate.</p>
<p> [21] Significantly, that provision does not prohibit the inclusion of evidence 
  gathered in Canada from the record of the case. On the contrary, s. 33(1)(a) 
  speaks to "a document summarizing the evidence available to the extradition 
  partner for use in the prosecution", not the evidence, apart from evidence gathered 
  in Canada, available to the extradition partner. Given the significant procedural 
  implications flowing from the appellant's position, I am satisfied that if Parliament 
  had intended to confine the record of the case to evidence gathered outside 
  of Canada, it would have said so in clear terms. The fact that it did not substantially 
  weakens the appellant's position.</p>
<p> [22] Finally, there is good reason for Canada to insist that evidence gathered 
  in Canada conform substantively with our rules of evidence. Such a rule does 
  not place an onerous burden on the requesting partner. It does, however, preserve 
  the integrity of our justice system by affording fugitives the protection of 
  our laws and values while they remain in Canada. In that way, the Act provides 
  a front-line check on the methods used by both foreign and domestic law enforcement 
  agencies to collect evidence in Canada. </p>
<p> [23] Insisting that evidence gathered in Canada comply substantively with 
  our rules of evidence is one thing; insisting that it take a certain form is 
  quite another. The latter does nothing to preserve or protect the integrity 
  of our justice system and it creates a barrier to the prompt and efficient discharge 
  of our international obligations. </p>
<p> [24] As it is, matters of this nature tend to drag on far too long. The case 
  at hand is no exception. On March 29, 2000, the appellant was arrested in Canada 
  on a provisional warrant. On January 30, 2002, Whealy J. ordered his committal 
  for surrender. On April 19, 2002, the Minister of Justice authorized his surrender 
  to the requesting state. It is now almost four years from the date of his arrest 
  and the appellant continues to remain in Canada. </p>
<p> [25] That track record hardly speaks to the prompt and efficient discharge 
  of our international obligations. To add another layer of delay to the process 
  by requiring that evidence, lawfully gathered in Canada and otherwise admissible 
  under our rules of evidence, must (absent an exception under our law) take the 
  form of viva voce testimony at an extradition hearing, runs contrary to the 
  spirit and purpose of the Act and the timely fulfillment of our international 
  obligations. Such an interpretation of s. 32(2) should be avoided.</p>
<p> CONCLUSION</p>
<p> [26] The identification evidence provided by Detective Hernandez was lawfully 
  gathered in Canada and properly admissible under Canadian law. There was no 
  requirement that it take the form of viva voce testimony at the extradition 
  hearing. Rather, it was admissible as part of the record of the case.</p>
<p> [27] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
