<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Douglas H. Lissaman of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated December 6, 2001. </p>
<p>
  ARMSTRONG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This case arises as a result of an automobile accident in which a jury found 
  the appellant, Dalida Safadi, 75 percent negligent and the respondent, Brian 
  Hansen, 25 percent negligent in respect to the injuries suffered by the plaintiff, 
  Lynette McFarlane. Lissaman J. rendered judgment in accordance with the jury's 
  verdict.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellants raise two issues on this appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) The conduct of the trial by the trial judge in respect 
  to interventions made by him; and </p>
<p class="indent">(ii) The failure of the trial judge to charge the jury on the 
  law of negligence.</p>
<p>
  The Factual Background</p>
<p>
  [3] On a rainy evening in July 1997, Dalida Safadi ("Ms. Safadi"), 
  was driving her 1990 Plymouth van westbound in the curb lane of Walsh Avenue, 
  which is an extension of Wilson Avenue, in the City of Toronto. At the same 
  time, the respondent, Brian Hansen ("Mr. Hansen"), was driving his 
  1998 Ford rental car westbound in the median lane of Walsh Avenue. Mr. Hansen 
  was intending to exit Walsh Avenue at the Weston Road intersection. In order 
  to do so, he began to move into the curb lane to access the exit lane leading 
  onto the northbound lanes of Weston Road.</p>
<p>
  [4] Ms. Safadi testified that, as Mr. Hansen made this move, she noticed his 
  vehicle move up from behind her and cut her off. She applied her brakes, her 
  car did a 180 degree spin and ended up crashing into a bus shelter, which was 
  adjacent to the exit lane leading to Weston Road. Several people were standing 
  in the shelter waiting for a bus. The record before us does not disclose the 
  number of people or the extent of the injuries suffered by those waiting for 
  the bus, other than that three ambulances arrived (including an ambulance bus) 
  to transport people to the hospital.</p>
<p>
  [5] Mr. Hansen testified that before he attempted to make his lane change, he 
  looked over his right shoulder through the rear window of his car. He noticed 
  the van, driven by Ms. Safadi, but assumed that he could safely change lanes. 
  As he moved to the right, he heard the honking of a horn so he stopped moving 
  to the right and increased his speed. He then heard a crash, looked into his 
  rear view mirror and caught a glimpse of the accident. After driving for about 
  one kilometre, he turned his car around and returned to the scene of the accident 
  where he spoke to the police officer who was involved in looking after the injured.</p>
<p>
  [6] A number of legal actions were commenced as a result of the accident. The 
  damages of the plaintiff in this action, Lynette McFarlane, were settled before 
  trial. The trial of this action related to the cross-claims between Ms. Safadi 
  and Mr. Hansen and was for the sole purpose of determining the degrees of liability 
  of Ms. Safadi and Mr. Hansen.</p>
<p>
  The Trial</p>
<p>
  [7] The brief trial lasted two days before a jury. Counsel for Ms. Safadi called 
  three witnesses: Scott Fotheringham (the investigating police officer), Edward 
  Obasuyi (a bystander in the bus shelter) and Ms. Safadi. Mr. Hansen testified 
  on his own behalf. His counsel called no other witnesses.</p>
<p>
  [8] The main issue at trial was whether Mr. Hansen had made an unsafe lane change 
  and cut Ms. Safadi off, causing her to lose control of her car, or whether she 
  had failed in the circumstances to keep her car under control and was primarily 
  responsible for the accident.</p>
<p>
  [9] The police officer, Constable Fotheringham, was the key witness for Ms. 
  Safadi. He testified that he had arrived on the scene of the accident less than 
  a minute after it occurred. When he arrived on the scene, he first called the 
  ambulances and ensured that those persons who had been injured were looked after 
  and were transported to hospital. While he was attending to one of the injured 
  bystanders near the bus shelter, he was approached by Mr. Hansen, who said to 
  him, "I think I'm involved in this." He told Mr. Hansen to return 
  to his automobile where he would speak to him when he was finished dealing with 
  the injured.</p>
<p>
  [10] The following is an excerpt from the transcript of the evidence of Constable 
  Fotheringham in which he described his conversation at the scene of the accident 
  with Mr. Hansen. The words in quotation marks are words said to be spoken by 
  Mr. Hansen to Constable Fotheringham: </p>
<p class="indent"> "I am very concerned and very sorry. It's my fault. I was trying 
  to make a right turn to go north on this street."</p>
<p class="indent">He didn't identify the street; just pointed to it. </p>
<p class="indent">"I saw her coming up behind me, but I thought to myself there 
  is enough time. She swerved, then skidded over. I'm sorry. I move my car over 
  to here and wait for you."</p>
<p>After relating the above conversation, Constable Fotheringham testified: </p>
<p class="indent">
  At this particular moment, I'm making up my mind whether or not Mr. Hansen is 
  involved. I only need clarification on one thing, what lane he's in? So I asked 
  him the question: "What lane were you in?" and he gave me an answer. 
  He pointed to the westbound Walsh Avenue centre lane, which is in police terminology, 
  lane 1 or the centre lane, passing lane which is most people's terminology, 
  saying: "That one." So at that moment, I stopped everything. I held 
  a set of beliefs. I have formulated a set of opinions and I have come to an 
  opinion or belief, right.</p>
<p>
  [11] Constable Fotheringham made notes of his conversation with Mr. Hansen although 
  he admitted they were not verbatim and that he had not made a note of Mr. Hansen's 
  comment, "I think I'm involved in this." He testified he read his 
  notes back to Mr. Hansen at the conclusion of his interview. </p>
<p>
  [12] Constable Fotheringham testified that he concluded Mr. Hansen was responsible 
  for the accident. As a result, he made out a traffic ticket that charged Mr. 
  Hansen with the offence of making an unsafe lane change. The constable testified 
  that Mr. Hansen indicated that he wanted to enter a plea of guilty and pay the 
  fine immediately. </p>
<p>
  [13] Constable Fotheringham was cross-examined by counsel for Mr. Hansen, Barry 
  Percival, Q.C., who is one of the most experienced personal injury lawyers in 
  the province of Ontario. Early in the cross-examination, the trial judge began 
  to intervene by asking his own questions. When counsel for Mr. Hansen asked 
  the officer to confirm that his only note of the road condition on the evening 
  of the accident was that it was wet, the trial judge intervened as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: And you told us earlier this morning, I wrote down, 
  terribly wet conditions. Remember saying that.</p>
<p class="indent">THE WITNESS: Yes.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: And then you went on to say, I gave medical assistance 
  to the people in the bus shelter.</p>
<p class="indent">MR. PERCIVAL: Q. Do I take it that when you have terribly wet 
  conditions that the speed limit is not necessarily the most safest [sic] speed?</p>
<p class="indent">A. You are correct.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Thank you.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: And the rain was coming down, wasn't it?</p>
<p class="indent">THE WITNESS: Yes.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: Because you used the word pouring here today.</p>
<p class="indent">THE WITNESS: Yes.</p>
<p>
  [14] During the course of this cross-examination, counsel for Mr. Hansen confirmed 
  that Constable Fotheringham did not interview a number of prospective witnesses 
  about the accident. Before counsel completed his cross-examination, the trial 
  judge asked the following questions: </p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: You're a very experienced police officer, aren't 
  you?</p>
<p class="indent">THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: Now perhaps Mr. Percival is going to explore this, 
  but I'm going to say this. It seems to me that the suggestion is that you took 
  a certain course of action up here without doing what you normally do which 
  is to thoroughly investigate both sides. Now you follow that up.</p>
<p class="indent">MR. PERCIVAL: That's right.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Do you want to answer His Honour's question?</p>
<p class="indent">A. He's correct.</p>
<p>Counsel for Mr. Hansen then asked a further question on the 
  above issue and continued with other questions. At the completion of the cross-examination 
  of the police officer, the trial judge asked the officer the following question: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: Before Ms. Stefanovic deals with any questions that 
  she may have, did you ever interview Ms. Safadi?</p>
<p class="indent">THE WITNESS: No, Your Lordship. I felt the case was overwhelming.</p>
<p>
  [15] In re-examination, counsel for Ms. Safadi, Ms. Marina Stefanovic, attempted 
  to deal with the issue of the apparent lack of a thorough investigation by the 
  police officer. The trial judge intervened after the answer to her first question: </p>
<p class="indent"> MS. STEFANOVIC: Q. It was suggested to you and you agreed that 
  this was not a thorough investigation. Can you tell us why it was not a thorough 
  investigation?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Mr. Hansen cut it short by admitting, signing and making 
  the decision to accept guilt right there in front of me. If he had not maybe 
  have exercised or said something else of any nature that he would think it over 
  or it would take some time or whatever. Normally I just hand out the ticket 
  and then walk away. If that had happened, and Mr. Hansen hadn't put down his 
  Visa number and signed it right in front of me, then a whole series of other 
  things would have happened, but he cut it short by doing it right then and there.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: You can cross-examine on that point, if you wish 
  when Ms. Stefanovic is finished, Mr. Percival.</p>
<p class="indent">MR. PERCIVAL: Thank you, Your Honour.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: I find that answer a little troublesome, Officer. 
  Now I know you are an experienced police officer and I know that and I respect 
  you for it. The scene out there on Wilson, et cetera, must have been just absolutely 
  appalling, but it seems to me that perhaps your guard was down and that things 
  that you normally do as a careful police officer you didn't do. Is that fair 
  or unfair?</p>
<p class="indent">THE WITNESS: I think that is very correct, Your Lordship.</p>
<p class="indent">MR. PERCIVAL: I have no further questions on that issue.</p>
<p>
  [16] Counsel for Ms. Safadi then resumed her re-examination on the issue of 
  what constituted a thorough investigation: </p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: Ms. Stefanovic, is that it?</p>
<p class="indent">MS. STEFANOVIC: Q. I'd like to ask what a thorough investigation 
  would entail that ties into my previous question.</p>
<p class="indent">A. It would involve the use of land surveying instruments called 
  &#133;.. total station. It's a surveying instrument using refracted light and 
  lasers. A very, very careful set of measurements would have been taken of the 
  entire scene, the entire roadway, the position of the vehicle, the position 
  of debris fields. A complete and accurate scale diagram would have been completed 
  detailing all of the scene evidence and all of the road evidence. I wasn't terribly 
  concerned about doing all of that.</p>
<p>
  [17] After the answer to the above question, the trial judge again intervened: </p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: You felt it wasn't necessary, isn't that right? 
  That was a judgment call you made having the discussions with Mr. Hansen and 
  I have already suggested to you that once you knew, according to him, that the 
  van was in front of him, that led you to a certain conclusion.</p>
<p class="indent">MR. PERCIVAL: Your Honour, I think the evidence is the van was 
  behind him.</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: I was trying to make a right turn to go north 
  on this street. I saw her coming up behind me. Thank you.</p>
<p class="indent"> MR. PERCIVAL: Thank you, Your Honour.</p>
<p class="indent"> MS. STEFANOVIC: Q. Was there anything at the scene of the 
  accident that was inconsistent with Mr. Hansen's statement?</p>
<p class="indent"> A. Nothing.</p>
<p class="indent"> MS. STEFANOVIC: Thank you. Those are my questions.</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: Just before you go, let's get back to the words: 
  "I saw her coming up behind me, but I thought to myself there was enough time. 
  She swerved and then skidded over." You obviously thought that Mr. Hansen was 
  cutting her off, which led you to the position that you took. Let me ask you 
  this based on your experience. What duties were there on this occasion on the 
  driver of the van as far as her driving was concerned? What duties were there 
  on her?</p>
<p class="indent"> THE WITNESS: She's going in a straight line. The vehicle 
  to her right, her left is coming over towards her. She has to exercise due care 
  and attention to both, what's going to her left, to her own driving skills, 
  to her own control of the vehicle and to her braking.</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: One wonders perhaps why she didn't manage to slow 
  down and avoid the emergency in front of her. Doesn't one wonder about that, 
  Officer?</p>
<p class="indent"> THE WITNESS: One does.</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: And one wonders about that when you hear the evidence. 
  As my late mother would say, it was raining cats and dogs and it was raining 
  cats and dogs. I don't know where that expression came from, but you said something 
  like pouring. I'm just wondering about whether Mrs. Safadi was really driving 
  as furtively as she should have been in terrible conditions. What do you say 
  to that?</p>
<p class="indent"> THE WITNESS: That is the judgment of the triers of fact.</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: The problem I have is that perhaps, Officer Fotheringham, 
  you jumped to a conclusion like that relative of yours who writes in the paper 
  from time to time.</p>
<p class="indent"> THE WITNESS: It is possible, Your Honour.</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: I assume he's a very distant relative of yours, 
  is he?</p>
<p class="indent"> THE WITNESS: I don't read him very often.</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: He comes from the small side of the Fotheringham 
  family. All right, that's enough.</p>
<p>
  [18] Counsel for Ms. Safadi did not ask any further questions in re-examination. 
  However, she moved for a mistrial on the basis that the questions asked of the 
  police officer by the trial judge seriously prejudiced her client in the eyes 
  of the jury. In response to this motion, the following exchange took place between 
  the trial judge and counsel for Ms. Safadi: </p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: I will tell you now. I shall tell this jury that 
  I have some concerns about the investigation of the police officer, and I will 
  definitely, without any question, tell the jury that, but I shall tell them 
  at all times that they are the finders of fact and not me, and I shall say to 
  them you can ignore me completely. That is what I will do.</p>
<p class="indent">MS. STEFANOVIC: I am grateful for that, but I fear that that 
  will not relieve the prejudice that may have been placed.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: I frankly don't see it that way, Ms. Stefanovic. 
  I do not see it whatsoever. I am entitled to ask questions of a witness and 
  I ask questions of a witness. I can tell you right now I am very much of the 
  opinion that this police officer did not do his job properly and if you want 
  me to proceed without the jury, I can, but you would have very serious risks 
  because of the views that I have. I am absolutely of the opinion that this police 
  officer, a very experienced police officer, fell into a trap. I mean I think 
  it is absolutely unbelievable and I tried to tell everybody here yesterday. 
  It is unbelievable that a police officer should proceed the way he has proceeded. 
  Unbelievable! I mean I am not going to declare a mistrial. It is either going 
  to go on with me alone or with a jury and my wish is the jury, and you should 
  wish it is the jury, and I will explain exactly what you have told me.</p>
<p class="indent">MS. STEFANOVIC: That's fine, Your Honour.</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: You do not want me to strike the jury, do you?</p>
<p class="indent">MS. STEFANOVIC: Your Honour, my request would be for a mistrial 
  first and if you are disposed to not granting, then my relief in the alternative 
  was to ask you to give the jury a direction regarding &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">THE COURT: The jury will get a very strong direction. I do not 
  agree with you at all that my questions were incorrect. They were questions 
  that begged to be asked.</p>
<p class="indent">MS. STEFANOVIC: That may be so, Your Honour. We have a very 
  senior counsel that could have asked those questions and I'm just concerned 
  that coming from you &#133;</p>
<p>
  [19] The trial judge went on to say that he could cure any of her fears in his 
  charge to the jury. Commenting on her decision to bring the motion, he added: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I can tell you now that I hope the people who instruct you are in the courtroom 
  and I know they are.</p>
<p>After a further exchange with counsel on his interventions, the trial judge 
  said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  THE COURT: Any worries you have should be set. What is the word? You should 
  not worry so much. I, undoubtedly, will tell this jury, and I promise you that, 
  and you can object if I don't, I'm going to tell this jury. I shall have a dialogue 
  with them over this and I shall tell them exactly what their duty is. I will 
  tell them that I may have given the impression that I was concerned about steps 
  taken or not taken in this case, but it is for them to decide. It is for them 
  to decide. The thing that bothered me is that the police officer, having established 
  the location of the cars, he then made a judgment without investigating and 
  talking to other people involved. I mean I am still thinking about that as a 
  matter of fact. I mean I have been around a long time too and it is just unbelievable 
  that an experienced police officer should have proceeded that way, but your 
  point is noted. Your motion, as I have told you, is dismissed. You do not want 
  to strike the jury notice?</p>
<p>
  MS. STEFANOVIC: No, Your Honour.</p>
<p>
  [20] The trial judge then gave further assurances that he intended to correct 
  the problem in his charge to the jury. He also advised Ms. Stefanovic that she 
  could clear up some of the issues concerning what her client did when she called 
  Ms. Safadi as a witness. </p>
<p>
  [21] In his charge to the jury, the trial judge opened with the following observation: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I think it is unlikely that I will comment on the evidence in this case. You 
  have heard it. You can make your own mind up with respect to it. </p>
<p>
  [22] Later in his charge, the trial judge told the jury that they should ignore 
  his opinions about the evidence: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I want to emphasize that you are in no way bound to follow my opinion and if 
  you came to a conclusion that some of my questions indicated that I had a particular 
  opinion as to the facts of this case, then I ask you and I invite you just to 
  ignore any views that you have as to what I might think. I want to emphasize 
  it is your duty to place your own interpretation on the evidence. It is for 
  you to decide whether someone should have slowed down. It is for you to decide 
  whether someone should or should not have made a turn. It is that kind of stuff 
  that is for your - it is in your bailiwick. It is for your department, not for 
  me to comment on. </p>
<p>
  [23] In regard to the evidence of the police officer and the shortcomings in 
  his investigation, the trial judge charged the jury as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> I can tell you that I was disturbed on the evidence of the 
  police officer and I am sure you were too, but I was. On the other hand, I do 
  not want you to be carried away by that. The police officer arrived on the scene 
  and to use his expression, there was carnage everywhere.</p>
<p class="indent">I do not think there is any doubt that he jumped to a conclusion. 
  He jumped too quickly and my view is that he acknowledged that in the witness 
  box that he really did not do the kind of careful investigation that I think 
  that police officer would like me to think that he normally does because my 
  recollection of it is that he went to some lengths to talk about this is what 
  we do. We are always very careful to do this and do that, but I was singularly 
  unimpressed in this particular case. But I do not want to be too hard on him. 
  He was a police officer of 27 years experience.</p>
<p class="indent">I have pointed out the way the law treats guilty pleas and convictions 
  in Highway Traffic Act and Canadian Criminal Code cases relating to driving 
  offences. It is up to you to decide whether Mr. Hansen has, and the onus is 
  on him, whether he has negated that evidence against him and Mr. Percival has 
  made a persuasive case to the effect that he has.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Stefanovic has made her arguments too and they are persuasive. 
  I would suggest, with the greatest respect, that you pay particular attention 
  to the evidence that you have heard in this case. You come to your conclusion 
  with respect to the effect of the guilty plea. There is no doubt there was a 
  guilty plea and there was no doubt there was a conviction, but it certainly 
  was not a careful investigation and it certainly was not after a trial. So I 
  think I have told you how to deal with that.</p>
<p>
  [24] The trial judge gave to the jury the questions that they were required 
  to answer on the negligence or lack of negligence of Ms. Safadi and Mr. Hansen. 
  He also told the jury that they could use the evidence of Mr. Hansen's conviction 
  for making an improper lane change as evidence of negligence against Mr. Hansen. 
  However, at no place in the charge did he discuss the elements that constitute 
  negligence as a cause of action and their relation to the case at bar. It should 
  be noted that neither counsel made any objection to his charge on this issue.</p>
<p>
  The Appeal</p>
<p>
  [25] As already indicated, the appellants assert that the judgment should be 
  set aside on the grounds of interventions made by the trial judge and the failure 
  of the trial judge to charge the jury on the law of negligence. </p>
<p>
  (i) Conduct of the Trial by the Trial Judge</p>
<p>
  [26] The appellants' case that the conduct of the trial by the trial judge created 
  an appearance of unfairness is largely based on the trial judge's criticism 
  of the inadequate investigation conducted by Constable Fotheringham, criticism 
  that he commented on during the presentation of the evidence and in his charge 
  to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [27] In addition, counsel for the appellants raised a concern about the judge's 
  manner of addressing the witness, Edward Obasuyi, as "the gentleman with 
  the difficult name from Nigeria". Counsel compared this with the trial 
  judge's more favourable reference to Mr. Hansen as "a good Dane". 
  Although the references were unnecessary and perhaps unfortunate, it is not 
  necessary to deal with them in order to decide the case.</p>
<p>
  [28] Counsel for the appellants also suggested that the trial judge's deferential 
  references to counsel for Mr. Hansen supported an inference of reasonable apprehension 
  of bias. Although the trial judge may have made one or two references to counsel 
  for Mr. Hansen that carried a hint of unnecessary deference, none of them was 
  of such a character that it raised a reasonable apprehension of bias. Most of 
  the time, the trial judge was equally solicitous of counsel for Ms. Safadi.</p>
<p>
  [29] However, I reluctantly come to the view that the trial judge's interventions 
  during the presentation of the evidence of the police officer and his reference 
  to the lack of a proper investigation in his charge to the jury resulted in 
  an unfair trial.</p>
<p>
  [30] In Majcenic v. Natale, [1968] 1 O.R. 189 (C.A.), Evans J.A. described improper 
  judicial intervention at 204: </p>
<p class="indent">
  When a Judge intervenes in the examination or cross-examination of witnesses, 
  to such an extent that he projects himself into the arena, he of necessity, 
  adopts a position which is inimical to the interests of one or other of the 
  litigants. His action, whether conscious or unconscious, no matter how well 
  intentioned or motivated, creates an atmosphere which violates the principle 
  that "justice not only be done, but appear to be done". Intervention 
  amounting to interference in the conduct of a trial destroys the image of judicial 
  impartiality and deprives the Court of jurisdiction. The right to intervene 
  is one of degree and there cannot be a precise line of demarcation but if it 
  can be fairly said that it amounted to the usurpation of the function of counsel 
  it is not permissible.</p>
<p>
  [31] The hallmark of a fair trial is that the judge preside with impartiality 
  and neutrality between the parties. The judge must not cross the line and become 
  a participant in the litigation. When he or she does so, his or her impartiality 
  and neutrality are lost. It is at that moment that the trial ceases to be fair. 
  </p>
<p>
  [32] Sometimes a trial judge unwittingly crosses the line without intending 
  to do so. This is a more common error and appears to be what happened in the 
  present case. Unfortunately, unintentional conduct may also result in an unfair 
  trial.</p>
<p>
  [33] In my view, the trial judge made two fundamental errors in his conduct 
  of the trial. </p>
<p>
  [34] The first error of the trial judge is found in his questioning of the police 
  officer. His questions went beyond the permissible limit. A trial judge may 
  ask questions of a witness for the purpose of clarifying issues or amplifying 
  areas of the evidence that require further explanation. However, if a trial 
  judge questions a witness in a manner that gives the impression that he or she 
  is adopting a particular position in opposition to one of the parties, he or 
  she has gone too far. See James v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue) (2000), 
  266 N.R. 104 at para. 52 (F.C.A.); Majcenic v. Natale, supra, at 203-204.</p>
<p>
  [35] In this case, the trial judge cross-examined the police officer on his 
  failure to carry out a proper accident investigation. It was unnecessary for 
  him to do so. As already stated, Mr. Hansen was represented by experienced counsel. 
  The responsibility for asking these questions lay with counsel. Before counsel 
  had developed the point in cross-examination, the trial judge intervened with 
  the following leading question: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Now perhaps Mr. Percival is going to explore this, but I'm going to say this. 
  It seems to me that the suggestion is that you took a certain course of action 
  up here without doing what you normally do which is to thoroughly investigate 
  both sides. Now you [referring to Mr. Percival] follow that up.</p>
<p>
  [36] The trial judge took over the role of counsel. This was exacerbated by 
  the trial judge when, on his own initiative, he asked Constable Fotheringham, 
  "What duties were there on this occasion on the driver of the van as far 
  as her driving was concerned?" The trial judge then offered his own observation 
  concerning Ms. Safadi's driving skills. All of this should have been left to 
  counsel for Mr. Hansen.</p>
<p>
  [37] The second error of the trial judge is found in his strong expression of 
  opinion concerning the adequacy of the police officer's investigation. This 
  manifested itself in the questioning referred to above, his comments on the 
  motion for a mistrial and in his charge to the jury. </p>
<p>
  [38] Although the trial judge was entitled to express his opinion on the evidence, 
  he had to do so with great care so as not to unfairly influence or appear to 
  unfairly influence the jury. Again, in my view, the trial judge went too far. 
  His leading questions of the police officer left no doubt how he viewed this 
  case. </p>
<p>
  [39] The trial judge advised the jury in his charge that, "If you come 
  to a conclusion that some of my questions indicated that I had a particular 
  opinion as to the facts of this case, then I ask you and I invite you just to 
  ignore any views that you have as to what I might think." Whether such 
  an instruction was sufficient is questionable. However, its effect was significantly 
  reduced by his subsequent return to his strong criticism of the police officer's 
  failure to conduct a thorough accident investigation.</p>
<p>
  [40] In my view, based on the comments of the trial judge, the jury would have 
  had a very difficult time coming to any conclusion other than that the police 
  officer had failed to do his duty and, had he not done so, he would likely have 
  come to a different conclusion concerning Mr. Hansen's liability.</p>
<p>
  [41] The evidence of the police officer was central to Ms. Safadi's case. The 
  questions and opinions of the trial judge discredited his evidence. I conclude 
  that such conduct created the appearance of unfairness and necessitates a new 
  trial. </p>
<p>
  (ii) The Failure of the Trial Judge to Charge the Jury on the Law of Negligence</p>
<p>
  [42] The trial judge was obliged to include appropriate instructions in respect 
  to the law of negligence. See Koebel v. Rive, [1958] O.R. 448 (C.A.). However, 
  in view of the failure to object by either counsel and in light of my conclusion 
  in respect to the conduct of the trial, it is unnecessary to give effect to 
  this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [43] In the result, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment and order 
  a new trial.</p>
<p>
  Costs</p>
<p>
  [44] I would grant the appellants their costs of the appeal on a partial-indemnity 
  basis, fixed at $18,000.00, including disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
