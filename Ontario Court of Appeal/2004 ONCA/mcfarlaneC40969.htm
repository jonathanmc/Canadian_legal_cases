<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: May 20, 2004</p>
<p>[1] On April 28, 2003, following a preliminary hearing before Fairgrieve J. 
  of the Court of Justice, the appellant was committed for trial on charges of 
  trafficking cocaine, possession for the purpose of trafficking, possession of 
  cocaine and possession of the proceeds of crime. On October 10, 2003, the appellant 
  brought an application for certiorari to quash the committal. On October 29, 
  2003, Gans J. of the Superior Court of Justice denied the application. The appellant 
  appeals that order on two bases: (1) on the trafficking charge, there is no 
  evidence to establish that the substance involved was cocaine; and (2) on the 
  other charges, there is no evidence to link the appellant to the drugs and money 
  in the apartment.</p>
<p>[2] We disagree. A court reviewing the propriety of a committal order should 
  not interfere with the order if there is &quot;some evidence&quot; or &quot;a 
  scintilla of evidence&quot; respecting each essential element of the offence 
  charged: see R. v. Skogman (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 161 at 173 (S.C.C.). This 
  case meets that very low threshold.</p>
<p>[3] On the trafficking charge, there was police evidence that the appellant 
  made a hand-to-hand exchange with an unidentified individual, who in turn sold 
  something to a purchaser, Everett Tugwell. Mr. Tugwell was arrested. At the 
  appellant's preliminary hearing, Mr. Tugwell testified that he paid $4000 for 
  cocaine in this purchase. This evidence meets the threshold.</p>
<p>[4] On the other charges, the drugs and money were found inside an apartment 
  to which the appellant had a key on his person when he was arrested. The transactions 
  involving the appellant, an unidentified person and Mr. Tugwell occurred in 
  the parking lot of this apartment building.</p>
<p>[5] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
