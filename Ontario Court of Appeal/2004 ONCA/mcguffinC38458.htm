<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our endorsement allowing this appeal in part, we awarded the appellant 
  costs of the appeal and invited the parties to provide submissions with respect 
  to the costs of the trial. We have now received those submissions. The appellant 
  submits that the respondent should be deprived of his costs in accordance with 
  former rule 76.10 because as a result of our decision the respondent/plaintiff 
  obtained a judgement of $25,000. Rule 76.10(2) provided that the plaintiff shall 
  not recover any costs unless the action was under the simplified procedure at 
  the commencement of the trial or "the court is satisfied that it was reasonable 
  for the plaintiff to have commenced and continued the action under the ordinary 
  procedure".</p>
<p>[2] We are satisfied that it was reasonable for the respondent to have commenced 
  and continued the action under the ordinary procedure. The respondent's original 
  claim was for $70,000 and at trial he obtained an award of $54,980.34. The original 
  claim was based on bona fide estimates from contractors of the cost of replacing 
  the work originally performed by the appellant. </p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, we would not interfere with the costs award made at trial.</p>
<p>Signed: "McMurtry C.J.O."<br>
  "M. Rosenberg J.A."<br>
  "E.E. Gillese J.A."</p>
