<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Mr. Gary John McHugh, the appellant husband, appeals from the judgment 
  of Backhouse J. of the Superior Court of Justice in which she found that the 
  parties separated on August 15, 2000. Mr. McHugh asserts that the separation 
  was, in fact, on June 6, 1996. The separation date is important for the calculation 
  of the net family property and the amount of the equalization payment owed by 
  the appellant to his wife. There was evidence before the trial judge upon which 
  she could conclude that the separation date was August 15, 2000. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant argues that his truck and trailer were acquired with funds 
  derived from compensation arrears for an injury suffered prior to his marriage 
  and, therefore, he was not obliged to account for their value as part of his 
  net family property. The trial judge rejected this argument because the appellant 
  provided no supporting documentation.</p>
<p>
  [3] While the appellant argued that the matrimonial home was originally purchased 
  with an inheritance from his grandmother, at the time of separation, it was 
  jointly owned by Mr. and Mrs. McHugh. Mrs. McHugh is entitled to have the property 
  sold; Mr. McHugh had been resisting its sale. The matrimonial home was Mr. and 
  Mrs. McHugh's only significant asset and the only practical way of effecting 
  the equalization of their property was to have it sold and the proceeds distributed. 
  In our opinion, the trial judge was justified in making the order she did. </p>
<p>
  [4] In regard to the value of the Nortel shares, they were properly treated 
  by the trial judge. Unfortunately the harshness of the result flows from the 
  volatility of the market.</p>
<p>
  [5] In regard to these conclusions of the trial judge, we are obliged to defer 
  to her findings of fact. The appeal is therefore dismissed. Counsel for the 
  respondent Mrs. McHugh has advised that she does not intend to press her cross-appeal 
  in the event that Mr. McHugh's appeal is dismissed. The cross-appeal is therefore 
  dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [6] Costs are fixed at $5,000 on a partial indemnity basis inclusive of disbursements 
  and G.S.T. payable by the appellant to the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [7] The amount of $40,946.19 plus appropriate interest, if any, presently held 
  by Shaw McLellan and Ironside representing the balance of the proceeds from 
  the sale of the matrimonial home shall be paid out to the respondent.</p>
