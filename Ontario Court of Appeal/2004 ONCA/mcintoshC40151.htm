<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, there were three errors which, together, rendered the trial 
  unfair: 1) the videotape was excluded without the trial judge, who did not see 
  it, having a proper basis for concluding it was not probative; 2) the charge 
  on reasonable doubt does not comply with Lifchus in that the trial judge failed 
  to mention the absence of evidence as a basis for reasonable doubt. In a circumstantial 
  case such as this, that is an important omission; and 3) the admission of expert 
  evidence that strayed into outlining the adverse social consequences of crack 
  cocaine use for the City of Hamilton was prejudicial in the context of this 
  case and required a limiting instruction. </p>
<p>[2] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is set aside and a new 
  trial ordered.</p>
