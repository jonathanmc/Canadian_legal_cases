<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>Nature of Appeal</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals his conviction for trafficking and possession for 
  the purposes of trafficking imposed by the Honourable Mr. Justice H. Spiegel 
  on September 27, 2000 and seeks leave to appeal from his sentence imposed in 
  absentia on October 16, 2000. This appeal was originally an inmate appeal and 
  was adjourned by Rosenberg J.A. to await the transcript. </p>
<p>[2] We called on the Crown to respond to only one of the grounds of appeal. 
  That issue was whether the trial judge erred in admitting the expert evidence 
  of Constable Canepa relating to drug trafficking. While the officer was allowed 
  too much latitude in the giving of his evidence, the core of his testimony on 
  the subject of drug trafficking was admissible. In relation to the disputed 
  aspect of Constable Canepa's evidence respecting the roles the various persons 
  would play in a three person transaction, the trial judge referred to the evidence 
  and noted that it contained an element of speculation. The trial judge was aware 
  that Constable Canepa's expertise was based on knowledge and experience and 
  of its limited use. We are not persuaded that we should interfere with his conclusion. 
  We see no merit therefore in the argument that the verdict was unreasonable. 
  In addition we do not agree that the trial judge could not consider the evidence 
  relating to count one when he turned to count two. See R. v. Thompson, [2003] 
  O.J. No. 441 (Ont. C.A.). Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
</p>
<p>[3] With respect to sentence, the sparseness of the reasons does not prevent 
  appellate review having regard to the trial judge's discussion with the Crown 
  that led to his disposition. The fact that the appellant had absconded and was 
  not present at the time of sentencing accounted for the trial judge's failure 
  to render more extensive reasons as to the disposition he made. In any event 
  the sentence was a fit and proper sentence. Accordingly, while we would grant 
  leave to appeal sentence the appeal from sentence is also dismissed. </p>
