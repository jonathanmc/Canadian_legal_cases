<p>On appeal from a judgment of Justice Norman D. Dyson of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 3, 2002, reported at [2002] O.J. No. 2195.</p>
<p>
  GILLESE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Rosemary Peaches McLean suffers from schizoaffective disorder. The disorder 
  is controlled through medication. On a number of occasions since being diagnosed, 
  Ms. McLean has stopped taking her medication and suffered psychotic, violent 
  episodes that involved herself, the police and members of the public.</p>
<p>
  [2] On June 13, 1998, Ms. McLean was in her apartment. She was suffering from 
  a psychotic episode brought on by a failure to take her medication. Toronto's 
  Emergency Task Force (&quot;the ETF&quot;) apprehended her and saw that she 
  was taken to hospital. Unfortunately, she suffered serious damage to her left 
  eye during the apprehension.</p>
<p>
  [3] After a fifteen-day trial, Justice Dyson reluctantly concluded that although 
  the ETF team members were well intentioned and extremely professional, they 
  used unreasonable force in apprehending Ms. McLean. He held that the firing 
  of a muzzle blast gun at close range to Ms. McLean's head when less lethal means 
  were available and in contravention of the prescribed procedures in the ETF 
  manual constituted negligence. He found that the cause of the injury to Ms. 
  McLean's eye was the firing of the gas gun. He ordered David Boothby, Chief 
  of the Toronto Police Service, to pay damages to Ms. McLean and certain other 
  Family Law Act claimants for the personal injuries that she had suffered.</p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge found Ms. McLean to have been contributorily negligent in 
  voluntarily failing to take her medication and assessed her contribution at 
  50%. </p>
<p>
  [5] The Toronto Police Services Board appeals on the basis that the trial judge 
  erred in finding the ETF negligent and in finding that it had caused Ms. McLean's 
  injuries. </p>
<p>
  [6] In addition, the Board appeals from the judgment in which the Chief of the 
  Toronto Police Service, David Boothby, is made liable for the damages. In the 
  Board's submission, s. 50 of the Police Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P-15 makes 
  the Board itself liable for torts committed by members of the police force in 
  the course of their employment. The respondent does not contest this matter 
  as &quot;&#133; there is no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice because 
  the Toronto Police Services Board is also a defendant and any necessary amendment 
  can be made.&quot; </p>
<p>
  [7] Ms. McLean cross-appeals from the trial judge's finding that she was contributorily 
  negligent. </p>
<p>
  [8] For the reasons that follow, apart from varying the judgment so that liability 
  is shown to lie with the Toronto Police Services Board rather than with Chief 
  Boothby, I would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal. </p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [9] Rosemary Peaches McLean suffers from schizoaffective disorder. When she 
  does not take her medication, she has psychotic episodes that have required 
  police intervention and hospitalization. Her behaviour during these episodes 
  includes wandering into the street and a stranger's residence, talking to herself, 
  lunging at a police officer with a knife, assaulting a 12-year-old girl, setting 
  fire to her living room and attempting suicide. </p>
<p>
  [10] In the afternoon of June 13, 1998, Ms. McLean's mother called the police 
  and asked them to pick up her daughter because she feared that Ms. McLean was 
  on the verge of an episode. When the police arrived, Ms. McLean told them she 
  was fine and they left.</p>
<p>
  [11] That same evening, two police officers responded to a 911 call from Ms. 
  McLean's neighbour. On arrival, they learned that Ms. McLean had threatened 
  the neighbour and the neighbour's child with a knife.</p>
<p>
  [12] The officers, Constables John Cilia and Kenneth Smith, knocked on the door 
  of Ms. McLean's basement apartment. Ms. McLean asked who they were and they 
  identified themselves. They received no further response from her.</p>
<p>
  [13] Constables Cilia and Smith notified their supervisor as well as the ETF, 
  a specialized division that regularly handles cases of mentally ill people. 
  Constable Smith told the radio dispatcher: &quot;We've got a MI [mental illness] 
  that won't open the door here, she threatened the other neighbour here with 
  some knives, she's definitely MI, we've got to see if we can get into this place.&quot;</p>
<p>
  [14] Constable Smith asked the radio dispatcher to tell the ETF to monitor the 
  situation but not to go to the scene. </p>
<p>
  [15] Constable Cilia continued to try to establish verbal contact with Ms. McLean 
  while Constable Smith gathered information. He learned from the landlord that 
  Ms. McLean was mentally ill and could be violent when she was sick. Constable 
  Smith also learned that Ms. McLean had recently tried to set fire to her apartment 
  and had tried to commit suicide in the past. Constable Smith remembered that 
  he himself had dealt with Ms. McLean two years earlier after a suicide attempt.</p>
<p>
  [16] Constables Cilia and Smith's supervisor, Sergeant Frank Seisel, arrived 
  on the scene. As the officers told him what they had learned, they could hear 
  furniture being dragged around the apartment. Both Constable Cilia and Constable 
  Smith testified that they were worried that Ms. McLean would try to set fire 
  to the apartment again. </p>
<p>
  [17] The officers knocked again and called out to Ms. McLean that they wanted 
  to talk to her. She remained unresponsive. They unlocked her door with a passkey 
  and found that it would only open slightly because furniture was barricading 
  it. Ms. McLean threw glass objects and dominoes at the partially open door. 
  Constable Cilia fired tear gas into the apartment and closed the door. He testified 
  that Ms. McLean was not affected by the tear gas fired through her front door. 
  However, Ms. McLean testified that the spray made her choke, cough, fall to 
  the ground and have breathing difficulties.</p>
<p>
  [18] At this point, the police decided to call in the ETF. Sergeant Seisel radioed 
  to Constable Dragos of the ETF: &quot;Yeah all it is it's a MI, there's no other 
  than just bottles and things of that nature being used as a weapon&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [19] An eight-person team from the ETF arrived within 10 minutes. Sergeant Gibson 
  and Constable Dragos were the team leaders. Sergeant Seisel summarized the situation 
  for Sergeant Gibson saying that Ms. McLean had threatened her neighbour with 
  a knife earlier in the evening, had a history of suicide attempts and police 
  involvement, and in the past had tried to set fire to her apartment. Sergeant 
  Gibson passed on the information to the rest of the team by radio.</p>
<p>
  [20] The ETF team knocked on Ms. McLean's door and called out to her but received 
  no response. They then opened the door with the passkey. Objects came flying 
  at them from inside. One of the officers fired a round of tear gas into the 
  apartment at which point Ms. McLean stopped throwing objects at the officers.</p>
<p>
  [21] The members of the ETF team entered the apartment and discovered that Ms. 
  McLean had gone into the bathroom at the back of the apartment. Sergeant Gibson 
  testified that he called out to her continuously as the officers moved through 
  the apartment, identifying himself by name, and reassuring her that they did 
  not want to hurt her. Ms. McLean could be heard talking to herself, but she 
  did not respond to the officers. The apartment was in complete disarray.</p>
<p>
  [22] The ETF officers inside the apartment did not want to burst through the 
  bathroom door for fear that the door would hit Ms. McLean as they opened it 
  or that she would attack the first officer who went through the door. Sergeant 
  Gibson and Constable Dragos discussed the option of firing tear gas into the 
  bathroom through the outside window to distract her so that the officers could 
  enter the bathroom and apprehend her.</p>
<p>
  [23] Constable Dragos took a muzzle blast gas gun from his vehicle and went 
  around the back of the building, removed the window screen and slid the window 
  open. As the window was at ground level, Constable Dragos was down on one knee 
  with his face at the window.</p>
<p>
  [24] Constable Dragos could see Ms. McLean sitting on the toilet almost directly 
  opposite the window and just a few feet away from him. She was facing the door. 
  Constable Dragos could only see Ms. McLean's face and upper body. Her arms were 
  moving in a rubbing motion. He could not see her hands. Ms. McLean did not notice 
  him. He did not try to make contact with her because he did not want her to 
  know he was there.</p>
<p>
  [25] After a quick assessment, Constable Dragos radioed to Sergeant Gibson that 
  he could safely fire a muzzle blast into the bathroom. Then he fired through 
  the bathroom window. Constable Dragos testified that he aimed toward the ceiling 
  above Ms. McLean and to his left, toward the door. He chose this angle so that 
  Ms. McLean would have to move away from the door to escape from the gas. This 
  would allow the rest of the team to burst through the bathroom door safely.</p>
<p>
  [26] The bathroom was less than five feet wide. When Ms. McLean sat on the toilet, 
  her head was less than three feet from the muzzle of the gas gun.</p>
<p>
  [27] After the muzzle blast shot, the ETF team entered the bathroom, apprehended 
  Ms. McLean and took her to the ambulance attendants so that she could be taken 
  to hospital. The ambulance attendant who put Ms. McLean on the stretcher noted 
  that she had a large bruise on her left eye. The evidence relating to the injury 
  to her left eye is considered more fully below in the section on causation. 
  She is now legally blind in her left eye.</p>
<p>
  [28] The final shot of tear gas was dispensed by Constable Dragos from a gas 
  gun known as a 37mm muzzle blast. This weapon is used to incapacitate people 
  temporarily in conditions where less than deadly force is necessary. When fired, 
  the muzzle blast makes a sound similar to a shotgun, which disorients suspects 
  briefly and gives the ETF time to approach and apprehend the person. The Toronto 
  Police Services Manual says that the tear gas gun may be used &quot;[w]hen all 
  options have been totally exhausted and negotiations have completely broken 
  down&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [29] At one point, the muzzle blast gun was used primarily for riot control. 
  At that time, the policy was that it was not to be fired directly at individuals. 
  In 1995, the manufacturer changed this safety policy so that the gun could be 
  fired directly at individuals at waist level. The Toronto Police Services Manual 
  states that the gun should be aimed only at the abdominal or chest area and 
  has a maximum effective range of five to fifteen feet. </p>
<p>
  [30] Sergeant Gibson and Constable Dragos testified that throughout the incident 
  they felt a sense of urgency. They thought Ms. McLean might be armed and had 
  to be treated as a risk to herself and to them. They knew about her violent 
  history and that she was in the midst of a psychotic episode. They knew that 
  she had had a knife in her hands earlier that night and they never saw her clearly 
  enough to know for certain whether she was still armed. However, at no time 
  did they or any other police or ETF officer see Ms. McLean with a knife.</p>
<p>
  THE EXPERT EVIDENCE</p>
<p>
  [31] At trial, Michael Hargreaves and Robert Seaton gave expert evidence on 
  behalf of Ms. McLean. Staff-Sergeant Craig Roberts gave expert testimony for 
  the ETF. Staff-Sergeant Peter Button was called by the ETF to testify about 
  the information available to the Toronto Police Service at the time of the incident 
  in relation to muzzle blast guns and use-of-force options. Although not called 
  as an expert witness, his qualifications and the gist of his testimony are set 
  out in this section for ease of reference.</p>
<p>
  [32] The experts disagreed about whether Ms. McLean posed a physical threat 
  to anyone when she was in the bathroom, whether the ETF should have attempted 
  further mediation before firing the muzzle blast into the bathroom, and, whether 
  there were less lethal ways to enter the bathroom and apprehend Ms. McLean.</p>
<p>
  Michael Hargreaves</p>
<p>
  [33] Michael Hargreaves is a firearm tactics instructor and former firearms 
  salesperson whose expertise is weapon safety, particularly for security personnel 
  and police. He has been a full-time, licensed professional firearms and tactics 
  instructor since 1981. He has taught approximately 500 students a year for each 
  of the past twenty years. He instructs on the use of rifles, submachine guns, 
  pistols, revolvers and shotguns. Since 1982 he has been a member of the International 
  Association of Law Enforcement Firearms Instructors. He is also a member of 
  numerous other related organizations, has taken courses in the area of firearms, 
  and has been qualified as an expert witness in other cases.</p>
<p>
  [34] The trial judge qualified Michael Hargreaves as an expert in the handling 
  and safe use of firearms, the tactical approach to dealing with situations of 
  stress, and the reconstruction of the incident involving Ms. McLean.</p>
<p>
  [35] Mr. Hargreaves recreated the scene in accordance with the testimony of 
  Constable Dragos. He used the following dimensions: the distance from the bathroom 
  window to the wall opposite that window was just under five feet; the distance 
  from the tip of the muzzle blast gas to Ms. McLean's eye was approximately 30 
  centimetres; and the windowsill was approximately 8 inches from the ground.</p>
<p>
  [36] Mr. Hargreaves testified that a manufacturer's warning as to how a weapon 
  should be used is very important, and that in this case, the part of the warning 
  on the muzzle blast that was most important was the part that cautioned against 
  firing directly at persons as serious injury or death might result. Mr. Hargreaves 
  stated that the distance a person is from a gun is an important factor in determining 
  when to use it because the person who is the target may move: when firing something 
  close to a person, unless they are immobilized prior to firing, there is no 
  control on what they might do in the time between making the decision to fire 
  and the firing of the weapon. The average lag time between a person's movement 
  and response to that movement is two or three-tenths of a second.</p>
<p>
  [37] In this case, the manufacturer's warning said that the muzzle blast should 
  be used at a distance of 25 to 30 feet. The ETF operational manual, however, 
  stated that the maximum effective range for the muzzle blast is 5 to 15 feet. 
  Mr. Hargreaves explained the disparity between the two warnings by noting that 
  the ETF developed its own training program without being trained by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
  [38] Mr. Hargreaves acknowledged that he has never fired a muzzle blast himself, 
  nor has he witnessed a muzzle blast dispersion being employed. However, he has 
  seen many films on it. He explained that the muzzle blast contains a type of 
  powder with cardboard wadding in front of it. </p>
<p>
  [39] According to Mr. Hargreaves, distance is important not only in terms of 
  providing time to react to surprise movements by the target, but also because 
  without enough distance between the muzzle blast and the target, the target 
  could be hit with the tube of powder or the nose-piece of cardboard. In this 
  case, Mr. Hargreaves felt that the distances were so small that the chance of 
  someone in Ms. McLean's position being struck by the wadding was so great that 
  to fire that weapon through the window was inappropriate and dangerous. </p>
<p>
  [40] Mr. Hargreaves further testified that in his opinion, the ETF did not need 
  to distract Ms. McLean in this case, and had they felt the need to distract 
  her, they could have done so in other ways. According to Mr. Hargreaves, Constable 
  Dragos should have told his teammates where Ms. McLean was located and what 
  she was doing, and the team should have simply overtaken her. Mr. Hargreaves 
  felt that this would not have endangered the officers because Ms. McLean would 
  not have had much reaction time, and the officers are very fit.</p>
<p>
  [41] Mr. Hargreaves explained that time frames are based on time of motion and 
  distance. In this case, Ms. McLean was nine inches away from the bathroom door. 
  Had the ETF opened the door, by the time Ms. McLean turned her head to look 
  towards the door, the ETF would have reached her.</p>
<p> [42] In cross-examination, Mr. Hargreaves acknowledged that in the 1990s, 
  the manufacturer of the muzzle blast changed its view as to the appropriate 
  use of the gun. Mr. Hargreaves also acknowledged that his recreation of the 
  scene differed from the evidence of Constable Dragos in that in Mr. Hargreaves' 
  recreation he pointed the gun directly at Daphne McLean's eye<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>, 
  whereas Constable Dragos aimed above the head of Ms. McLean. Mr. Hargreaves 
  acknowledged that if Constable Dragos aimed as he described, and if Ms. McLean 
  had not moved, Constable Dragos would not have hit Ms. McLean. </p>
<p>
  [43] Mr. Hargreaves also acknowledged in cross-examination that he has never 
  been a tactical officer or trained a tactical squad. He further recognized that 
  he has not instructed ETF personnel in a formal sense, and that his experience 
  in dealing with those with mental illnesses was limited to his role as a doorman 
  at his father's pub. However, he maintained that the tactical approach to be 
  used in a dangerous situation regularly comes up in teaching police tactical 
  units and firearms instructors. </p>
<p>
  Rod Seaton</p>
<p>
  [44] From 1976 to 1985, Rod Seaton was a member of the Metropolitan Toronto 
  Police Force where he was a fitness and self-defence instructor at the Toronto 
  and Ontario Police Colleges. He also co-authored &quot;Self-Defence: Armed and 
  Unarmed Tactics&quot;, armed tactics referring to the baton and unarmed tactics 
  referring to boxing and karate moves simplified and adapted for police use. 
  During this time, Mr. Seaton was also the team leader of a tactical team at 
  the ETF; he was with the ETF for close to three years. He testified that during 
  his time with the ETF he had training with respect to the use of a muzzle blast. 
  This training took place in the context of a two-to-three week preparation time 
  provided when a person joined the ETF, and consisted of training about weapons, 
  how to strip and clean them, their function, and what weapon to use on entry 
  and containment. Mr. Seaton had the opportunity to shoot the 37 millimetre gas 
  gun in training but never did so on call and was never on call when someone 
  else did so. </p>
<p>
  [45] From 1986 to 1999, Mr. Seaton was part of the Ontario Provincial Police 
  during which time he was a &quot;use-of-force&quot; instructor at the Ontario 
  Provincial Police Academy. He did not teach about the use of firearms, but taught 
  unarmed self-defence, gun retention, handcuffing, searching and use of the baton. 
  </p>
<p>
  [46] Since 1999, Mr. Seaton has operated a collision reconstruction consulting 
  firm where he is the principal. </p>
<p>
  [47] In the past, Mr. Seaton has been retained to review use-of-force options 
  in regard to s. 25 of the Criminal Code. He consults on police shootings and 
  on the use of force for police agencies. He has been retained by the Crown as 
  a consultant in both civil and criminal matters.</p>
<p>
  [48] Mr. Seaton is a member of the Canadian Association of Technical Accident 
  Investigators and Reconstructionists. In 1993 he took a five-week training program 
  that dealt with the skills involved in a tactical team and their functioning. 
  He has given evidence in Ontario courts as a reconstruction expert since 1994. 
  He has given lectures in the area of collision reconstruction. He founded the 
  Annual National Convention for the Canadian Society of Forensic Sciences in 
  Hamilton.</p>
<p>
  [49] Mr. Seaton has not been involved in any tactical operations since 1985. 
  He has shot a muzzle blast less than twenty times and has conducted no scientific 
  investigation into the use of the muzzle blast. The training he received when 
  he joined the ETF dealt with the use of weapons generally but not specifically 
  of muzzle blasts. He acknowledged that much has changed for tactical units in 
  the last nineteen years, and that when he was trained nineteen years ago, he 
  did not receive training in dealing with emotionally disturbed people, which 
  he would have to receive today in order to return to the ETF.</p>
<p>
  [50] Robert Seaton was qualified to offer expert opinion evidence about the 
  reconstruction aspects of the case and the use of force.</p>
<p>
  [51] Like Mr. Hargreaves, Mr. Seaton gave evidence with regard to the discrepancy 
  between the manufacturer's instructions and the instructions contained in the 
  ETF manual regarding use of the muzzle blast. He noted that while the discrepancy 
  between the two instructions is distance, both the manufacturer and the ETF 
  have identified that the point of aim for the muzzle blast is to be directed 
  below the neck and head areas in order to prevent injury to the eyes or face.</p>
<p>
  [52] Mr. Seaton testified that in his opinion, given Ms. McLean's position relative 
  to the point of aim and proximity to the end of the barrel of that weapon, she 
  was in a precarious and dangerous position, that the time spent from the time 
  the first tear gas round was discharged to the second was very short, and there 
  was no indication that Constable Dragos, who had visual observation of her, 
  made any attempt to mediate the problem verbally prior to discharging the tear 
  gas.</p>
<p>
  [53] In Mr. Seaton's opinion, it was not appropriate at that time for Constable 
  Dragos to have fired the muzzle blast through the window. In his opinion, he 
  should have attempted mediation or some other method of distracting Ms. McLean, 
  such as having a conversation with her. Alternatively, Mr. Seaton opined that 
  the ETF should simply have burst into the bathroom. He acknowledged that there 
  would have been an element of risk involved in using the last mentioned alternative.</p>
<p>
  [54] Mr. Seaton acknowledged that the manufacturer of the muzzle blast has stated 
  that it is appropriate to fire a muzzle blast over someone's head and let the 
  tear gas settle down on them. He also acknowledged that if the evidence of Constable 
  Dragos was accepted, the tear gas would have settled on Ms. McLean's head as 
  described. He refused to describe the situation as volatile because the bathroom 
  door was shut and Ms. McLean was being visually observed.</p>
<p>
  Craig Rogers</p>
<p>
  [55] Staff-Sergeant Craig Rogers is currently employed with the York Regional 
  Police. At the time of trial, he had been a member of that force for over 24 
  years. He began working with the York Regional Emergency Response Unit (ERU) 
  in April of 1986. The ERU performs essentially the same service as the ETF.</p>
<p>
  [56] After being with the ERU for two years, Staff-Sergeant Rogers was elected 
  team leader. As team leader, he coordinated training activities for ERU officers. 
  He also acted as unit commander when the unit commander was not present. Staff-Sergeant 
  Rogers was promoted to Sergeant in 1991 and to Staff-Sergeant in 1997. In March 
  2001, he assumed command of a platoon of officers. Currently, he is a negotiator 
  with the ERU, rather than a tactical commander.</p>
<p>
  [57] Over the last fifteen years, Staff-Sergeant Rogers has attended at approximately 
  800 tactical response calls, some of which involved emotionally disturbed persons 
  who were armed and barricaded. He has participated in the Ontario Tactical Advisory 
  Board, first as Vice-Chair and then as Chair. While filling those roles, he 
  was involved in establishing standards for tactical response teams. These standards 
  eventually became regulations to the Police Services Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P-15 
  in January 2001. Beginning in 1996, Staff-Sergeant Rogers served on the Ontario 
  Board of the Tactical Standards Development Process. This panel's goal was to 
  develop tactical standards further, which standards were to become part of the 
  regulations to the Police Services Act, supra. </p>
<p>
  [58] Staff-Sergeant Rogers has instructed in basic tactical orientation courses. 
  Part of the instructions he gave in these courses involved the use of muzzle 
  blasts. As Chair of the Ontario Tactical Advisory Board he oversaw and appointed 
  course administrators and ensured the courses were in accordance with course 
  training standards.</p>
<p>
  [59] Since 1986, Staff-Sergeant Rogers has been a member of the National Tactical 
  Officers' Association, an organization that shares information among, offers 
  conferences for and provides materials to, police tactical response teams. He 
  has been a member of the Canadian Critical Incident Association, which deals 
  more specifically with incident command and crisis negotiation, for approximately 
  seven years. </p>
<p>
  [60] Staff-Sergeant Rogers has taken a number of tactics and rescue orientation 
  courses. He took a chemical munitions instructors course that included instructions 
  on how to use the muzzle-blast weapon. He was trained in two uses of the muzzle 
  blast: (i) how to use the muzzle blast as a means of crowd control and (2) how 
  to use it as a tactical response. As part of the training regarding the latter 
  use, they were taught to use the muzzle blast at a distance of five to fifteen 
  feet. </p>
<p>
  [61] Staff-Sergeant Rogers has won a civilian citation award, the Police Officer 
  of the Year award in 1985 and the Meritorious Service Award in 1995. </p>
<p>
  [62] Staff-Sergeant Rogers was qualified by the court to give expert opinion 
  evidence with respect to the operation and training of tactical units, the appropriate 
  use of force, and the training and deployment of chemical munitions. </p>
<p>
  [63] Staff-Sergeant Rogers gave the opinion that the choice of the muzzle blast 
  501 cartridge was a viable option as it was not fired directly at an individual 
  and it was used in conjunction with tear gas. He testified that, in his opinion, 
  the situation with Ms. McLean could not have been resolved through negotiation 
  because there was no dialogue between the officers and Ms. McLean. Further, 
  Ms. McLean would have been classified as high risk because she was not using 
  any mechanism to try to get the situation to end.</p>
<p>
  [64] Staff-Sergeant Rogers explained that, in his experience, the muzzle blast 
  gun is an effective, less-lethal means to apprehend and subdue violent persons 
  that are or may be armed with weapons other than firearms. He explained that 
  in order to err on the side of caution, it is important to assume that there 
  is a weapon present in a situation such as the one with Ms. McLean.</p>
<p>
  [65] Staff-Sergeant Rogers explained, in his report, that although the manufacturer's 
  label on the 37 millimetre muzzle blast munition indicates otherwise, the munition 
  is utilized by most tactical teams in Canada and the USA by means of contact 
  on the subject. He stated that the muzzle blast is generally used in a range 
  of between five and fifteen feet and is applied directly to the centre of the 
  body.</p>
<p>
  [66] When asked about Constable Dragos's decision to use the muzzle blast in 
  the circumstances involving Ms. McLean, Staff-Sergeant Rogers explained that 
  he would not have had any concerns about possible injury to Ms. McLean where 
  a munition was aimed in the fashion Constable Dragos described. With regard 
  to Ms. McLean's injuries, Staff-Sergeant Rogers testified that in his opinion, 
  if she had been hit in the face at the range suggested, he would have expected 
  to see much more significant injuries in the face area. With regard to Constable 
  Dragos's testimony that his view into the bathroom was obstructed because of 
  the cloud of dust created after discharge of the munition, Staff-Sergeant Rogers 
  testified that this testimony was consistent with the muzzle blast travelling 
  to the ceiling, being disseminated there, and bouncing off the walls. </p>
<p>
  [67] Staff-Sergeant Rogers felt that there were advantages to using the muzzle 
  blast in the situation involving Ms. McLean: the officer using the muzzle blast 
  can direct where he or she wants the agent to go and where he or she wants it 
  to be disseminated. Also, the munition would act as a distraction. Staff-Sergeant 
  Rogers felt that injury would likely have resulted to Ms. McLean even if the 
  ETF had simply burst into the bathroom, because they would have had to overcome 
  her. He also explained why use of the muzzle blast was a better choice than 
  the use of a taser, baton or 517 munition. </p>
<p>
  [68] Staff-Sergeant Rogers agreed that attempting to establish contact with 
  the suspect in a situation such as the one involving Ms. McLean is very important, 
  and that he probably would have tried calling Ms. McLean by telephone had he 
  actually been at the scene in issue. He agreed that while in the bathroom Ms. 
  McLean posed no threat to the police officers. He acknowledged that an average 
  barricaded-suspect situation goes from three to six hours.</p>
<p>
  Peter Button </p>
<p>
  [69] Peter Button is a member of the Toronto Police Service where he currently 
  serves as an armament officer. He joined the Toronto Police Service in 1975 
  and worked as a uniformed constable for nine years.</p>
<p>
  [70] In 1984, Staff-Sergeant Button was promoted to Sergeant. He served for 
  two years as a uniform supervisor in that capacity. In 1986, he was selected 
  for service with the Special Weapons Team of the Metropolitan Toronto Police 
  ETF. He held this position for approximately seven and a half years. Six of 
  those seven and a half years were spent engaged as Sergeant or Team Leader on 
  the Special Weapons Team, attending to the resolution of approximately 300 high-risk 
  calls and high-risk warrant services. For the other year and a half with the 
  ETF, Staff-Sergeant Button served as the training officer where he was in charge 
  of firearms and tactical training and involved in approving, setting and maintaining 
  standards. He was also responsible for the preparation of written manuals and 
  the design and evaluation of training. </p>
<p>
  [71] In 1993, Staff-Sergeant Button transferred to the Toronto Police College 
  as supervisor in the firearms and tactical training section. He held this position 
  for approximately one year where he was again in charge of firearms and tactical 
  training. </p>
<p>
  [72] In 1994, Staff-Sergeant Button was promoted to Acting Staff-Sergeant, and 
  appointed as a service armament officer. As an armament officer, he is responsible 
  for approving, setting and maintaining records of firearms and tactical training 
  qualifications for the Police Service. </p>
<p>
  [73] While with the ETF, Staff-Sergeant Button had considerable experience with 
  the muzzle blast. He has used the weapon approximately 100 times in training, 
  has seen it used operationally approximately twenty times, and has personally 
  used it during an operation approximately five times. </p>
<p>
  [74] According to Staff-Sergeant Button, the thirty-seven millimetre blast dispersion 
  cartridges have been available since the inception of the ETF in 1967. It was 
  first used directly on a subject in 1979, when it was fired directly at an emotionally 
  disturbed person at close range; in that case, the subject was successfully 
  incapacitated without injury to himself or other persons. </p>
<p>
  [75] Staff-Sergeant Button explained that the blast dispersion cartridge is 
  a payload of talcum powder and C.S. gas in a powdered form; therefore, what 
  is fired is not a solid projectile. C.S. gas is a type of tear gas. According 
  to Staff-Sergeant Button, the powder that is ejected from the muzzle blast weapon 
  is yellowish-white in colour and the cartridge has a priming system in the bottom 
  to indicate ignition. When the cartridge is fired, the primer is struck by the 
  firing pin of the thirty-seven-millimetre gas gun and detonates the gunpowder. 
  The gunpowder is covered by a cardboard wadding charge, and on top of that wadding 
  charge is the payload, the blast dispersion contents, thirty-eight grams of 
  talcum powder and the active ingredient C.S. This is all sealed in the canister 
  with a cardboard wad or wads at the top. </p>
<p>
  [76] Staff-Sergeant Button explained that when the weapon is fired, the cardboard 
  wads go where the weapon was pointed. However, Staff-Sergeant Button further 
  explained that as the cardboard wads travel farther, by which he meant about 
  three or four feet, there could be deflection. Staff-Sergeant Button explained 
  that the situation involving Ms. McLean is the only case of which he is aware 
  in which the subject individual complained of injury as a result of the application 
  of the muzzle blast weapon. </p>
<p>
  [77] Staff-Sergeant Button conducted part of the research in the area of less 
  lethal weapon technology that was included in the Use of Force Committee Final 
  Report, produced in May of 1998. As Staff-Sergeant Button explained, 'less lethal' 
  is a concept that utilizes planning, tactics, and unconventional equipment, 
  in an effort to resolve critical incidents in a manner that is less likely to 
  cause serious injury or death than conventional police tactics and weapons. 
  An example of a less lethal weapon would be the C.S. blast dispersion. In his 
  section of the report, Staff-Sergeant Button was attempting to fulfill the overall 
  mandate of the committee, which was to identify and investigate any method that 
  might be useful in reducing the use of force, especially the use of deadly force, 
  by the police. </p>
<p>
  [78] In his discussion of less lethal weapons, Staff-Sergeant Button explained 
  in his report that the weapon must stop threats reliably and must incapacitate 
  the subject instantly. According to Staff-Sergeant Button, instant incapacitation 
  is important because any time lapse between the application and the effect of 
  a weapon is a danger, especially when the officer is in close range to the subject. 
  This is because during any sort of time lapse between application and effect 
  the subject can react violently. Also, ideally a less lethal weapon would be 
  effective on subjects who Staff-Sergeant Button described as &quot;highly motivated&quot;. 
  &quot;Highly motivated&quot; subjects include emotionally disturbed persons 
  who, as mentioned, often have higher pain thresholds than other people when 
  agitated.</p>
<p>
  [79] Staff-Sergeant Button testified that of the police tactical teams in North 
  America that have been properly equipped, the vast majority would have blast 
  dispersion cartridges in their inventory. He further testified that most tactical 
  teams would use the muzzle blast in a similar fashion to the ETF, namely by 
  direct application to an individual.</p>
<p>
  [80] As explained by Staff-Sergeant Button, there are three primary uses for 
  tear gas: crowd control, to cause barricade-penetrating projectiles to induce 
  surrender, and direct application on a suspect armed with a non-firearm weapon. 
  The added advantage of a muzzle blast, according to Staff-Sergeant Button, is 
  the flash and bang that occur on detonation, which causes some subjects to become 
  disoriented. However, according to Staff-Sergeant Button, one disadvantage of 
  tear gas is that it permeates the area in which it is released, requiring anyone 
  operating in the area to wear a gas mask. </p>
<p>
  [81] Staff-Sergeant Button told the court that ETF members work ten-day cycles: 
  this involves three days of training and seven days of operations. Staff-Sergeant 
  Button explained that many less lethal tools require teamwork to employ them 
  properly. When employing the muzzle blast, two officers approach within ten 
  to fifteen feet of the subject, armed with muzzle blasts. Two more officers, 
  who are armed with lethal force in case the muzzle blast is ineffective, follow 
  behind. </p>
<p>
  [82] According to Staff-Sergeant Button, the role of the tactical team is to 
  support front line uniform investigative personnel who do not have the training 
  or equipment necessary to guarantee successful resolution of situations such 
  as the one involving Ms. McLean through low levels of force. As Staff-Sergeant 
  Button put it: &quot;&#133;tactical teams exist to save lives.&quot; Staff-Sergeant 
  Button noted that encounters between police officers and emotionally disturbed 
  persons have gone up considerably in the last ten years. </p>
<p>
  [83] Staff-Sergeant Button agreed, in cross-examination, that negotiation and 
  mediation are a &quot;key&quot; part of resolving tense situations and persuading 
  barricaded subjects to surrender. He agreed that negotiation and mediation would 
  be the &quot;least lethal&quot; means of resolving a dispute. He explained that 
  ETF officers receive extensive training in negotiation. While maintaining that 
  ETF officers are trained to attempt negotiation and mediation with an emotionally 
  disturbed person only in certain circumstances, he agreed that the vast majority 
  of calls to the ETF are resolved purely through negotiation and surrender. According 
  to Staff-Sergeant Button, negotiation is not appropriate where there is a risk 
  that an emotionally disturbed person may harm him or herself, or others. Staff-Sergeant 
  Button explained that generally, the sergeant in charge of the team decides 
  when negotiation must end and further action must be taken. </p>
<p>
  [84] Staff-Sergeant Button agreed that the percentage of situations in which 
  the muzzle blast is employed is very low. In terms of alternatives, the ETF 
  has used tasers for approximately a year. Also, Staff-Sergeant Button noted 
  that as alternatives to the muzzle blast, tear gas can be administered through 
  a twelve-gauge shotgun or a grenade.</p>
<p>
  [85] When asked about the manufacturer's instructions with regard to the muzzle 
  blast, Staff-Sergeant Button testified that while those instructions are important, 
  the Toronto Police Service had used both experience and innovation to come up 
  with a different use for the muzzle blast, namely one-on-one applications to 
  potentially dangerous persons. Staff-Sergeant Button explained that the current 
  ETF manual states that the muzzle blast should be fired at belt level, and cautions 
  that if it is fired at a suspect's face, the suspect could be blinded or suffer 
  severe facial injuries from the flash or muzzle blast round. Staff-Sergeant 
  Button agreed that it is very important for an officer firing the muzzle blast 
  to make sure it does not hit someone in the face, particularly where the officer 
  is in close proximity to the subject. Staff-Sergeant Button testified that the 
  muzzle blast is more dangerous than pepper spray, and is appropriate in situations 
  involving a subject who has a non-firearm weapon.</p>
<p>
  [86] Staff-Sergeant Button explained that ETF officers have hand-held shields 
  for ballistic protection from firearms. He further explained that the shields 
  are generally effective against handguns and shotguns, but rifle rounds generally 
  penetrate them. The shields are about three feet in height and two and half 
  feet in width, and often weigh thirty-five to forty pounds. Staff-Sergeant Button 
  agreed that the shields are sometimes used to &quot;takedown&quot; a subject. 
  </p>
<p>
  [87] In response to a request for clarification by the trial judge, Staff-Sergeant 
  Button explained that because the muzzle blast is a pyrotechnic device, there 
  is a certain amount of gunpowder in the cartridge. For this reason, when it 
  is fired there is some flame approximately a foot and a half from the barrel. 
  According to Staff-Sergeant Button, if a subject was injured by the flash of 
  a muzzle blast, as opposed to the gunpowder, he or she would suffer burns. Staff-Sergeant 
  Button described that a blast from a blast dispersion gun would come out initially 
  in a fairly dense stream, like a garden hose, when it is turned down to its 
  &quot;narrow function&quot;. He added that at a distance of two or three feet, 
  dissemination occurs and a large cloud forms. </p>
<p>
  THE TRIAL DECISION </p>
<p>
  [88] At trial, the judge found that the muzzle blast gun is potentially a very 
  dangerous weapon, especially when fired at close range. The trial judge noted 
  that all defence witnesses conceded that the gas gun should not be aimed at 
  a suspect's face as to do so would probably result in serious injury.</p>
<p>
  [89] The trial judge said this in finding the ETF liable: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In my view, the firing of the second muzzle blast into the bathroom was unreasonable, 
  unnecessary, excessive and constitutes negligence on the part of the police. 
  I find the police negligent in using the muzzle blast weapon when less lethal 
  means were available. Further, I find that the police knew or ought to have 
  known that by firing the muzzle blast at such close range serious personal injury 
  was probable. Also, I find that the police were negligent in failing to follow 
  the prescribed procedure outlined in their own manual with respect to mediation.</p>
<p>
  [90] The trial judge concluded that Ms. McLean's eye injury was caused as a 
  result of the muzzle blast discharge in the bathroom. He awarded Ms. McLean 
  damages for pain and suffering, permanent physical injury, loss of sight in 
  the left eye, disfigurement and psychological trauma. He also awarded damages 
  to her mother, sister and daughter for temporary loss of her companionship and 
  guidance due to the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder that Ms. McLean suffered 
  after the incident.</p>
<p>
  [91] The trial judge found Ms. McLean contributorily negligent due to her non-compliance 
  with her drug regimen prior to the incident. He found that she knew or ought 
  to have known that she experiences psychotic episodes when she does not take 
  her medication and that her episodes create a risk of harm to others. He further 
  found that Ms. McLean's episodes are precipitated by a conscious decision on 
  her part to discontinue drug therapy. He assessed her liability at 50 percent. 
  </p>
<p>
  THE ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [92] The appellants raise the following three issues: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Did the trial judge err by ignoring or misapprehending critical 
  liability evidence?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Did the trial judge err in admitting the opinion evidence 
  of Mr. Seaton and Mr. Hargreaves?</p>
<p class="indent">3. Did the trial judge err in finding that the muzzle blast 
  caused the injury to Ms. McLean's left eye?</p>
<p>
  ISSUE #1: Did the trial judge err by ignoring or misapprehending critical liability 
  evidence?</p>
<p>
  [93] The appellants argue that the trial judge erred by ignoring most of the 
  evidence that was presented that was favourable to them, including evidence 
  on the appropriate standard of care and the lack of reasonable alternatives 
  to the tactics employed by the appellants. They submit that it was &quot;decidedly 
  incumbent&quot; upon the trial judge to state his reasons for ignoring or rejecting 
  such evidence. The main case they cite for this proposition is Phillips v. Ford 
  Motor Co. of Canada Ltd. (1971), 2 O.R. 637 (CA), which was followed in Westco 
  Storage v. Inter-City Gas Utilities Ltd., [1984] 4 W.W.R. 289 (Man. C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [94] The case law indicates that where a trial judge fails to address the evidence 
  of a witness, this in and of itself is not grounds for overturning the trial 
  judge's decision; to say that it is &quot;decidedly incumbent&quot; on a trial 
  judge to give reasons for rejecting the evidence of a witness in every case 
  is to overstate the obligation. </p>
<p>
  [95] It is always preferable for a trial judge to give reasons for rejecting 
  the evidence of a witness, but where he or she fails to do so, this failure 
  is only significant in that it may indicate an error on the part of the trial 
  judge in coming to the conclusion he or she reached. Therefore, the question 
  in this case is not whether it was &quot;decidedly incumbent&quot; upon the 
  trial judge to give reasons for rejecting the evidence of Staff-Sergeants Rogers 
  and Button; rather, the question is whether the trial judge erred in reaching 
  the conclusion he did.</p>
<p>
  [96] In this case, the issue for the trial judge was whether the ETF used unreasonable 
  force in apprehending Ms. McLean. In deciding this issue, the trial judge had 
  to determine whether the discharge of the muzzle blast gas gun into the bathroom 
  was reasonable and necessary in the circumstances. He concluded that it was 
  not and that the act constituted negligence. </p>
<p>
  [97] As the Supreme Court of Canada recently stated, a determination of whether 
  the appellants met the standard of care involves the application of a legal 
  standard to a set of facts; this is a question of mixed fact and law and is 
  subject to the standard of review of palpable and overriding error unless it 
  is clear that the trial judge made some extricable error in principle with respect 
  to the characterization of the standard or its application. See Housen v. Nikolaisen, 
  [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at para. 37. </p>
<p>
  [98] I cannot accept the appellants' contention that the trial judge made an 
  error in principle by ignoring critical liability evidence. I accept that the 
  trial judge relied upon the expert evidence led by the respondents and that 
  nowhere in his reasons does the trial judge expressly advert to the evidence 
  of Staff-Sergeants Rogers and Button. That said, it is implicit that he rejected 
  their evidence where it conflicted with that given by the respondents' experts 
  and, for the reasons given in the following section, the trial judge was entitled 
  to rely on the expert evidence adduced by the respondents. Preferring the evidence 
  of an expert on a certain point is not necessarily tantamount to ignoring the 
  conflicting evidence of another. In this case, a reading of the reasons as a 
  whole shows that the trial judge implicitly rejected the evidence of the appellants' 
  experts on the issues of whether the use of the muzzle blast gun was reasonable 
  and necessary in the circumstances. While it would have been preferable had 
  the trial judge explained why he rejected the expert evidence led on behalf 
  of the appellants, the implicit rejection of the appellants' expert evidence 
  cannot be said to be an error in principle where the trial judge's determinations 
  are otherwise supportable on the evidence before him. </p>
<p>
  [99] In my view, it cannot be said that the trial judge made a palpable and 
  overriding error in his findings of fact or in his application of the appropriate 
  legal standards to the facts. The trial judge found that at the time of the 
  second firing of the muzzle blast gun, Ms. McLean was not a physical threat 
  to herself or the ETF. The evidence on the record supports such a conclusion. 
  Ms. McLean was locked in a tiny bathroom that was surrounded by armed police 
  officers. She was being directly observed by Constable Dragos through an open 
  window at a distance of approximately three feet. She could be seen to be rubbing 
  something over her face and body. The ETF did not observe Ms. McLean to be in 
  possession of a knife or other weapon. Very little time elapsed between the 
  time that the ETF first fired a tear gas round (21:55 hours) to the second firing 
  of the muzzle blast gun (22:00 hours). Other less forceful means of apprehending 
  Ms. McLean, such as mediation, had not been tried. </p>
<p>
  [100] The trial judge was also entitled, on the evidence on the record, to conclude 
  that firing the muzzle blast gun at such close range made serious injury probable. 
  The evidence showed that serious injury or death could occur if a person was 
  struck in the face by a muzzle blast. The police manual provided that the maximum 
  effective range was between five and fifteen feet; the end of the barrel of 
  Constable Dragos' muzzle gun was within three feet of Ms. McLean's face when 
  he fired it. The small distances in the bathroom, Ms. McLean's position in respect 
  of the muzzle blast gun and the known dangers associated with the use of the 
  muzzle blast gun justify the trial judge's determination on this point. </p>
<p>
  [101] Accordingly, the first ground of appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  ISSUE #2: Did the trial judge err in admitting the opinion evidence of Mr. Seaton 
  and Mr. Hargreaves?</p>
<p>
  [102] For expert evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant and necessary, 
  not offend any exclusionary rule, and be given by a properly qualified expert. 
  R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9. The appellants argue that the trial judge erred 
  in admitting the testimony of Mr. Seaton and Mr. Hargreaves because it offended 
  the fourth criterion. Specifically, they say that both experts lacked the necessary 
  qualifications to give opinion evidence and that there was no reliable foundation 
  for their opinions.</p>
<p>
  [103] The court qualified Mr. Seaton to give expert evidence about the reconstruction 
  of the situation involving Ms. McLean, as well as on the use of force. </p>
<p>
  [104] The trial judge qualified Mr. Hargreaves as an expert in the handling 
  of firearms and the safe use of firearms, as well as in the tactical approach 
  to dealing with situations of stress and the reconstruction of the incident 
  involving Ms. McLean. The trial judge acknowledged that Mr. Hargreaves had no 
  formal training with respect to the muzzle blast gun and little formal instruction 
  in the area of tactical approaches. He noted, however, that Mr. Hargreaves had 
  much experience in the safe handling of weapons, had received much instruction 
  with respect to the safe handling of weapons of all kinds, and some instruction 
  with respect to the tactical approach to situations of stress. The trial judge 
  concluded that when Mr. Hargreaves testified on topics where his expertise might 
  be deficient, this would be reflected in the weight given to his testimony.</p>
<p>
  [105] The test for determining whether an expert is properly qualified to give 
  opinion evidence was stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Marquard 
  (1993), 108 D.L.R. (4th) 47 at p. 78, in these words: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The only requirement for the admission of expert opinion is that the &quot;expert 
  witness possesses special knowledge and experience going beyond that of the 
  trier of fact&quot;&#133; Deficiencies in the expertise go to weight, not admissibility. 
  </p>
<p>
  [106] A consideration of the facts in Marquard reveals that the threshold for 
  admissibility is not high.</p>
<p>
  [107] In Marquard, the appellant was convicted of aggravated assault on her 
  granddaughter. The appellant claimed that her granddaughter had burned herself 
  accidentally when playing with a butane lighter. The Crown contended that the 
  appellant had intentionally burned her granddaughter on a hot stove in order 
  to discipline her. At trial, one expert was called by the Crown to testify as 
  to the characteristics of an abused child and a second expert was called to 
  testify as to the nature or origin of the child's burns. In the course of giving 
  her opinion on the characteristics of abused children, the first expert expressed 
  the opinion that the child suffered from a contact burn rather than a flame 
  burn. The second expert expressed his opinion that the characteristics of abused 
  children matched the description of the child's behaviour in this case. The 
  appellant argued that the trial judge erred in allowing the experts to testify 
  on areas outside their expertise and in failing to instruct the jury to ignore 
  this evidence.</p>
<p>
  [108] The Court held that although the first expert did not have specialized 
  knowledge in the area of burns, as a practising physician she possessed an expertise 
  on burns that is not possessed by the ordinary untrained person and therefore 
  met the threshold test for admissibility. Similarly, while the second expert 
  possessed no particular expertise on the characteristics of abused children, 
  the Court was satisfied that he met the test for admissibility because his long 
  experience working with injured children had given him a degree of expertise 
  not possessed by lay persons.</p>
<p>
  [109] The Court acknowledged that the experts had provided opinions on matters 
  outside of those for which they had been qualified by the trial judge to testify. 
  However, at p. 79 it stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Important as the initial qualification of an expert witness may be, it would 
  be overly technical to reject expert evidence simply because the witness ventures 
  an opinion beyond the area of expertise in which he or she has been qualified. 
  As a practical matter, it is for opposing counsel to object if the witness goes 
  beyond the proper limits of his or her expertise. The objection to the witness's 
  expertise may be made at the stage of initial qualification, or during the witness's 
  evidence if it becomes apparent the witness is going beyond the area in which 
  he or she was qualified to give expert opinion. In the absence of objection, 
  a technical failure to qualify a witness who clearly has expertise in the area 
  will not mean that the witness's evidence should be struck. However, if the 
  witness is not shown to have possessed expertise to testify in the area, his 
  or her evidence must be disregarded and the jury so instructed. </p>
<p>
  [110] The fact that another person may have been more qualified to testify on 
  a particular topic goes to weight, rather than admissibility. See Regina v. 
  Wade, [1994] O.J. No. 543 (CA), appeal to SCC allowed on other grounds [1995] 
  2 S.C.R. 737. Moreover, the trial judge is entitled, when determining whether 
  to admit expert evidence, to consider whether that evidence is necessary to 
  rebut the evidence of an expert testifying for the other side. See R. v. Russell, 
  [1994] O.J. No. 2934 (C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [111] The other aspect to this argument on behalf of the appellants is that 
  there was no reliable foundation for the opinions of Messrs. Seaton and Hargreaves. 
  The appellants point to the comments of the Supreme Court of Canada R. v. J.-L.J., 
  [2000] 2 S.C.R. 600 at para. 29 that emphasize the trial judge's &quot;gatekeeping&quot; 
  function when considering the admissibility of expert evidence. For example, 
  it is said that there was no reliable foundation for the opinions of Messrs. 
  Hargreaves and Seaton, that the &quot;burst and grab&quot; approach advocated 
  by Mr. Hargreaves lacks general acceptance by others in the field and that not 
  all relevant facts were considered when Mr. Seaton came to the opinion that 
  the ETF should have negotiated longer with Ms.McLean. </p>
<p>
  [112] I cannot accept this submission. The trial judge is obliged both to determine 
  the admissibility of expert evidence and to decide what weight is to be given 
  to such evidence as is admitted. If the methodology that an expert employs is 
  flawed or the opinion is based on ignoring certain facts or lack of a reliable 
  foundation, these are matters that the trial judge must take into consideration 
  in deciding which evidence to accept and what weight to accord it. The admonition 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. J.-L.J. that expert evidence must pass 
  a threshold test of reliability speaks primarily to the issue of novel science 
  or the novel application of accepted science. In this case, there is no suggestion 
  that the opinions offered were the result of novel science or the novel application 
  of accepted science. </p>
<p>
  [113] While I accept that Staff Sergeant Rogers had superior qualifications 
  to those of Messrs. Seaton and Hargreaves, it does not follow that the trial 
  judge was obliged to prefer Staff Sergeant Rogers' evidence nor to rule as inadmissible 
  the opinion evidence of Messrs. Seaton and Hargreaves. In my view, both Messrs. 
  Seaton and Hargreaves had some special knowledge and experience going beyond 
  that of the trier of fact upon which they based their testimony. Any deficiencies 
  in their expertise go to the weight and not the admissibility of their evidence. 
  The trial judge was aware of the relative strengths in experience and background 
  of the various experts as is apparent from the comments he made in relation 
  to Mr. Hargreaves and which are summarized above. He expressly noted that deficiencies 
  in expertise would be dealt with in the weight accorded to the various experts. 
  It cannot be said that the trial judge erred in admitting the testimony of Messrs. 
  Seaton and Hargreaves or in the approach he adopted in determining upon what 
  evidence to rely.</p>
<p>
  ISSUE #3: Did the trial judge err in finding that the muzzle blast caused the 
  injury to Ms. McLean's left eye?</p>
<p>
  [114] The appellants argue that the trial judge erred in finding that the muzzle 
  blast gun caused the injury to Ms. McLean's left eye. A brief review of the 
  following facts shows that the trial judge's finding is amply supported on the 
  record. </p>
<p>
  [115] Just before firing the gas gun, Constable Dragos had a clear view of Ms. 
  McLean's face. She was about three feet away from him. He saw nothing unusual 
  about her face nor did he see any sign of injury to her eye. Within one or two 
  seconds of firing the gas gun, the door was breached and Ms. McLean was apprehended 
  and handed over to the ambulance attendants. All of the police officers testified 
  that Ms. McLean did not struggle, did not fall and strike her face and was not 
  struck in the face or eye. </p>
<p>
  [116] The ambulance attendant who put Ms. McLean on a stretcher noted that she 
  had a large bruise on her left eye. Constable Cilia rode in the ambulance with 
  Ms. McLean to the hospital. He prepared an injury report that stated that Ms. 
  McLean's left eye was swollen and cut.</p>
<p>
  [117] Dr. Sousa testified that the damage to the eye was consistent with high 
  speed blunt trauma to the eye. It was not consistent with striking her head 
  against a wall or being punched or struck by a sharp object. He also stated 
  that the injury could have been caused by tear gas if the tear gas was shot 
  like a blunt missile or by the cardboard wadding holding the tear gas. He testified 
  that it was unlikely that the injury was caused by falling on something and 
  that the injury was not self-inflicted.</p>
<p>
  [118] I would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  THE CROSS-APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [119] Ms. McLean argues that her failure to take her medication was a symptom 
  of her illness and was involuntary on her part. She argues that she cannot be 
  held to be contributorily negligent as the result of an involuntary act for 
  which she could not reasonably foresee the consequences. </p>
<p>
  [120] Ms. McLean is aware that she has a medical disorder and that failure to 
  take her medication will lead to psychotic episodes. She is also aware that 
  she has had a number of prior psychotic episodes, brought on by a failure to 
  take her medication, and that such episodes have led to physically violent altercations 
  with the police and members of the public as well as threats of harm to herself. 
  She made the decision to stop taking her medication while she was medicated 
  and lucid.</p>
<p>
  [121] In the circumstances, the trial judge was fully justified in concluding 
  that Ms. McLean acted voluntarily and was contributorily negligent when she 
  knowingly stopped taking her medication.</p>
<p>
  [122] Accordingly, I would dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [123] I would allow the appeal only to the extent of ordering that the judgment 
  be amended so that it reflects that the Toronto Police Services Board, not the 
  Chief of Police, bears liability. I would dismiss the cross-appeal. As success 
  is divided, I would make no order as to costs.</p>
