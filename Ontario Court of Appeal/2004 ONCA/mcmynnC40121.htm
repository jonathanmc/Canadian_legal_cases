<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Norman D. Coo of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated May 5, 2003.</p>
<p>
  GILLESE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Joanne Jacqueline McMynn and Robert McMynn leased some buses to a numbered 
  company carrying on business under the name of Maple Rhodes.</p>
<p>
  [2] Maple Rhodes obtained comprehensive business insurance from Lombard General 
  Insurance Company of Canada that provided coverage for, among other things, 
  a fleet of buses owned or leased by Maple Rhodes, including those leased from 
  the McMynns.</p>
<p>
  [3] One of the leased buses was damaged in an accident. Lombard paid the cost 
  of repairing the bus less the amount that Maple Rhodes owed for unpaid premiums. 
  </p>
<p>
  [4] The McMynns began legal proceedings to recover the cost of the unpaid premiums 
  from Lombard. In a judgment dated May 5, 2003, Coo J. ordered, among other things, 
  that Lombard could not rely on s. 134(2) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. I.8 "to withhold loss payment amounts otherwise payable" to the 
  McMynns. </p>
<p>
  [5] Lombard appeals that judgment.</p>
<p>
  [6] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [7] Lombard General Insurance Company, the appellant, is an insurance company 
  licensed to sell insurance in Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [8] The respondents, Joanne Jacqueline McMynn and Robert McMynn, operate a business 
  that leases buses.</p>
<p>
  [9] The McMynns agreed to lease a number of buses to a numbered company carrying 
  on business as Maple Rhodes. Maple Rhodes operated a passenger bus line.</p>
<p>
  [10] The lease agreement, dated January 20, 2001, required Maple Rhodes to (1) 
  place and maintain insurance coverage for loss or theft of or damage to the 
  leased vehicles; (2) pay the McMynns for any damage caused to a leased vehicle 
  in the event that the insurance proceeds were insufficient; and (3) indemnify 
  the McMynns from any damage, loss, theft or destruction of any leased vehicle. 
  The lease also specifically required Maple Rhodes to insure the McMynns under 
  the insurance policy that Maple Rhodes obtained.</p>
<p>
  [11] Maple Rhodes obtained a comprehensive business insurance policy from Lombard. 
  The policy provided coverage for, among other things, property damage, business 
  interruption, crime and general liability. It also provided insurance for the 
  fleet of buses owned or leased by Maple Rhodes. The policy covered such risks 
  as damage or loss to buildings and their contents, computer breakdown, sewer 
  back-up, accounts receivable losses, money and securities losses and earthquake 
  damage.</p>
<p>
  [12] The policy provided coverage for the McMynns, as the leasing company, under 
  a blanket lessor endorsement which reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy is extended to cover as 
  an Additional Named Insured, any Leasing Company, with respect to ownership 
  of automobiles, leasing automobiles to the Insured on a long term basis (over 
  30 consecutive days) for which the Insured is legally obligated to provide insurance. 
  </p>
<p>
  [13] The policy was in effect from January 18, 2001 to January 18, 2002. During 
  the term of the policy, premiums were withdrawn from Maple Rhodes's account 
  on a monthly basis. The amount of the monthly premium changed throughout the 
  term as a result of adding or deleting vehicles covered by the policy or as 
  a result of added endorsements. During its term, the policy covered as many 
  as twenty-nine vehicles. </p>
<p>
  [14] On October 3, 2001, one of the leased buses was damaged. Mississauga Truck 
  &amp; Bus repaired the bus. </p>
<p>
  [15] On January 18, 2002, Maple Rhodes's policy with Lombard expired. On that 
  date, the amount of $33,256.44 in unpaid premiums was outstanding. This amount 
  was directly withdrawn from Maple Rhodes's account and credited to Lombard in 
  accordance with Maple Rhodes's direct billing payment plan. However, on January 
  22, 2002, the January 18, 2002 direct billing withdrawal from Maple Rhodes's 
  account was reversed as there were insufficient funds in Maple Rhodes's account 
  to cover the withdrawal. That amount was then debited from Maple Rhodes's payment 
  schedule. Maple Rhodes's account was also charged $15.00 for the NSF fee. The 
  total amount of premiums, including the NSF fee, owing on January 27, 2002 was 
  $33,271.44.</p>
<p>
  [16] Maple Rhodes submitted a proof of loss dated April 12, 2002 to Lombard, 
  indicating that the repair cost to the bus was $174,678.27. Lombard authorized 
  payment in the amount of $130,774.24, which represented the $174,678.27 in damages 
  claimed, less GST in the amount of $10,632.59 and the unpaid premiums of $33,271.44. 
  </p>
<p>
  [17] On April 23, 2002, Lombard issued a cheque in the amount of $130,877.35 
  and made payable to "MISSISSAUGA TRUCK &amp; BUS AND MAPLE RHODES DIV OF 
  JLD BUS INC. &amp; JOANNE JAXQUELINE [sic] MCMYNN &amp; R &amp; J MCMYNN LEASING". 
  The back of the cheque was endorsed on behalf of R &amp; J McMynn Leasing, Joanne 
  Jacqueline McMynn and Maple Rhodes. The cheque was then deposited into the account 
  of Mississauga Truck &amp; Bus on May 1, 2002.</p>
<p>
  [18] The McMynns started proceedings against Lombard for the unpaid $33,271.44. 
  The applications judge made an order that Lombard was not entitled to rely on 
  s. 134(2) of the Insurance Act to withhold unpaid premiums. He reasoned that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The two clauses in the above section [134(2)] should be read conjunctively. 
  The applicants could not be pursued under the first clause; they may not be 
  pursued under the second. That interpretation certainly produces a more fair 
  and balanced result and one which is more logically consistent. It also is compatible 
  with the argument that no loss payee ought to be made globally liable for any 
  and all premiums unpaid by the insured unless the language, either of policy 
  or statute is clear on the point [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [19] Lombard appeals from that order. </p>
<p>
  THE ISSUE</p>
<p>
  [20] This appeal turns upon the proper interpretation of s. 134(2) of the Insurance 
  Act. Subsection 134(2) states that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The insurer may sue for the unpaid premium and may deduct the amount thereof 
  from the amount for which the insurer is liable under the contract of insurance.</p>
<p>
  [21] Lombard argues that s. 134(2) is ambiguous and, when correctly interpreted, 
  allows the insurer to automatically deduct the amount of unpaid premiums from 
  the amount for which it is liable. The McMynns, it argues, should be in no better 
  position than the insured under the policy of insurance that affords them coverage.</p>
<p>
  [22] The McMynns maintain that the applications judge correctly interpreted 
  s. 134(2) and that s. 134(2) restricts recovery by deduction to amounts payable 
  to the party responsible for payment of the premiums under the policy, not a 
  third party. </p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [23] In my view, the decision below was correct both in result and reasoning. 
  </p>
<p>
  [24] Subsection 134(2) of the Insurance Act is comprised of two clauses. The 
  first clause gives an insurer the right to sue for unpaid premiums. Although 
  s. 134(2) does not state whom the insurer has the right to sue, it must be assumed 
  to be the insured contracting party because, unless otherwise stipulated by 
  the insurance contract, it is the contracting party who is liable for the premiums, 
  not the added party. </p>
<p>
  [25] The second clause gives the insurer the right to deduct the amount of the 
  unpaid premium from the amount for which the insurer is liable. The second clause 
  is tied to the first clause by the word "and"; thus the two clauses 
  are to be read conjunctively. In that context, the intent of s. 134(2) must 
  be to restrict recovery by deduction to amounts payable to the party responsible 
  for payment of the premiums under the policy, not a third party. Thus, s. 134(2) 
  does not create a statutory right to withhold from a loss payment due to an 
  added insured an amount to cover unpaid insurance premiums owed by the insured 
  party. In my view, this is what the applications judge meant when he wrote that, 
  as the McMynns "could not be pursued under the first clause; they may not 
  be pursued under the second."</p>
<p>
  [26] The amounts payable under the insurance policy in the instant case are 
  for property damage sustained by a third party insured, the McMynns. The McMynns 
  are not the party with whom Lombard contracted. Therefore, Lombard is not entitled 
  to withhold the amount it was owed by Maple Rhodes for unpaid premiums when 
  making a payment to the McMynns. </p>
<p>
  [27] This interpretation of s. 134(2) produces a more fair and balanced result 
  than that argued for by Lombard. To allow Lombard to withhold the unpaid premiums 
  from the amount owed to the McMynns would be to make the McMynns, as loss payees, 
  liable for any and all of Maple Rhodes's unpaid premiums even though the premiums 
  were for a scope of coverage far greater than that in which the McMynns had 
  any interest. Moreover, it would make the McMynns liable outside the scope of 
  any temporal connection they might have had with such coverage as there is no 
  evidence that the premiums under the policy were in arrears at the time that 
  the leased bus was damaged. In my view, nothing short of the clearest possible 
  language would be required to shift legal responsibility for unpaid premiums 
  to third party insureds.</p>
<p>
  [28] I do not accept Lombard's argument that s. 134(2) is ambiguous. When s. 
  134(2) is read in its grammatical and ordinary sense and in context, it is clear 
  that it restricts recovery by deduction to amounts payable to the party responsible 
  for payment of the premiums under the policy, not a third party. As Iacobucci 
  J. said in Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. R., [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559 at 
  581: </p>
<p class="indent">
  What, then, in law is an ambiguity? To answer, an ambiguity must be "real" 
  [Marcotte v. Canada (Deputy A.G.), [1976] 1 S.C.R. 108]. The words of the provision 
  must be "reasonably capable of more than one meaning" (Westminster 
  Bank Ltd. v. Zang, [1966] A.C. 182 (H.L.), at p. 222 per Lord Reid). By necessity, 
  however, one must consider the "entire context" of a provision before 
  one can determine if it is reasonably capable of multiple interpretations. </p>
<p>
  [29] Lombard argues that reading the clauses in s. 134(2) conjunctively is an 
  error because such an interpretation would require an insurer to sue before 
  being able to deduct unpaid premiums. The question of whether an insurer is 
  required to sue before being able to deduct unpaid premiums is not in issue 
  on this appeal. The question before this court is whether Lombard is entitled 
  to deduct an amount for unpaid premiums from an amount owing to a third party. 
  I would add that there is nothing in the decision below to suggest that an insurer 
  must commence an action for premiums before it can deduct premiums from amounts 
  payable. Rather, the applications judge held that the conjunctive language made 
  it clear that both parts of s. 134(2) are to be read together and, as the right 
  of action could apply only to the contracting party, the right to deduct unpaid 
  premiums applies only to the same party. </p>
<p>
  [30] Lombard relies on MacRae v. British Aviation Insurance Co., [1983] M.J. 
  No. 93 (Q.B.) to argue that the rationale behind s. 134(2) is that where there 
  are earned premiums owing to the insurer at the time that the loss is payable, 
  it may deduct those premiums from the loss amount. On my reading of MacRae, 
  however, no such general proposition can be drawn; the result in MacRae is explicable 
  on its facts. </p>
<p>
  [31] In MacRae, the third party lessor was a party to the contract by way of 
  a special endorsement. Under the terms of the special endorsement, the lessor 
  was required to pay any premiums that the insured failed to pay. There is no 
  similar provision or endorsement in the case at bar. </p>
<p>
  [32] Finally, Lombard argues that the policy protected the McMynns' interest 
  and there is no justification for depriving an insurer of the premiums payable 
  in respect of the policy under which it provides coverage. As noted above, the 
  policy in question provided coverage for a great many more things than just 
  the McMynns' interest in the leased buses. There is no justification for requiring 
  the McMynns to pay for premiums on unrelated coverage that was of no benefit 
  to them and for which they could have made no claim. </p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [33] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondents fixed 
  at $4800.00, inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
