<p>On appeal from the decision of Justice Gertrude F. Speigel of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated April 28, 2003.</p>
<p>
  R. A. BLAIR J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] On this appeal, a Michigan law firm and one of its members seek to set aside 
  the order of Madam Justice G. Speigel holding that the Ontario Superior Court 
  of Justice has jurisdiction over the claim against them in this action and, 
  further, that Ontario is the forum conveniens for the dispute.</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [2] M.J. Jones Inc. is an Ontario transportation company. It was sued in Michigan 
  for loss of value, consequential damages and punitive damages, after a piece 
  of equipment it was carrying from Quebec to a purchaser in Michigan was damaged 
  in transit. Melvin Jones, the president of the company, was sued as well. I 
  shall refer to Mr. Jones and M.J. Jones Inc., together, as "Jones" 
  in these reasons.</p>
<p>
  [3] The Michigan law firm, Garan, Lucow, Miller, P.C. was retained by Jones' 
  insurer, Kingsway General Insurance Company, to defend the Michigan action. 
  A member of that firm, Thomas Emery, was the attorney who handled the case. 
  He did not contest the Michigan court's jurisdiction over the Ontario defendants, 
  nor did he contest the Michigan plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. He 
  did contest the subsequent reference regarding damages. Ultimately, the Michigan 
  plaintiff was successful in obtaining judgment for $246,445(U.S.) to replace 
  the damaged equipment and for $247,319(U.S.) for loss of use of the equipment. 
  No punitive damages were awarded.</p>
<p>
  [4] Although it never supplied him with a copy of its insurance policy, Kingsway 
  informed Emery on several occasions that there could be an issue regarding coverage, 
  particularly, with respect to punitive and consequential damages. Emery claimed 
  that his duty was to defend the insureds, however, and that under Michigan law 
  he could not get involved in coverage issues. He never warned Jones in writing 
  to appoint a lawyer to represent their interests beyond the Kingsway coverage. 
  Nor did Kingsway ever contact Jones to inform them that there were coverage 
  issues and that they may have been uninsured for levels of exposure in excess 
  of their coverage.</p>
<p>
  [5] Donald Fish and D.E. Fish &amp; Associates Ltd. (together, "Fish") 
  were the brokers who placed the insurance with Kingsway, on behalf of Jones.</p>
<p>
  The Present Action</p>
<p>
  [6] Following the Michigan judgment, Jones commenced the present action in the 
  Superior Court of Justice in Ontario. It claims damages,</p>
<p>
  a) against Kingsway for breach of contract, negligence, breach of duty of good 
  faith, and breach of fiduciary duty;</p>
<p>
  b) against Emery and the Michigan law firm for negligence and breach of fiduciary 
  duty; and,</p>
<p>
  c) against Fish in negligence for not securing better insurance coverage from 
  Kingsway.</p>
<p>
  [7] Kingsway and Fish have cross-claimed against all of their co-defendants, 
  including the appellants, for contribution and indemnity. Central to each of 
  these cross-claims is the allegation that Emery and the Michigan law firm were 
  negligent in their representation of Jones in the Michigan action and, particularly, 
  that they were negligent in not advising Jones about the limitations in coverage.</p>
<p>
  [8] Emery and the Michigan law firm moved to dismiss or stay the claim and the 
  cross-claims against them on the grounds that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  a) there is no real and substantial connection between Ontario and the claim 
  and cross-claims against them and, therefore, that an Ontario court does not 
  have jurisdiction to deal with them; and,</p>
<p>
  b) even if an Ontario court has jurisdiction, it should decline to exercise 
  that jurisdiction because Ontario is not the forum conveniens for the resolution 
  of the issues involving the appellants.</p>
<p>
  [9] Justice Speigel dismissed the motion. For the reasons that follow I would 
  dismiss the appeal from that decision.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [10] Section 106 of the Courts of Justice Act R.S.O.1990, c.C.43 permits the 
  court to stay any proceeding on such terms as are considered just. Rule 17.02 
  of the Rules of Civil Procedure sets out the circumstances in which an originating 
  process may be served outside of Ontario without leave, and rule 17.06 empowers 
  a party who has been served with such a process to move to set aside the service 
  or to stay the proceeding. The Ontario jurisprudence regarding the court's powers 
  to impose a stay on jurisdictional and forum conveniens grounds has developed 
  under the rubric of this statutory and regulatory framework. Although the appellants 
  originally attacked the service of the statement of claim outside of Ontario 
  under rule 17.02, that argument was abandoned before the motions judge. The 
  motion proceeded on the basis of the court's powers under section 106.</p>
<p>
  Jurisdiction</p>
<p>
  [11] Building upon principles earlier enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077, and Hunt v. 
  T &amp; N plc., [1993] 4 S.C.R. 289, this court, in a series of decisions authored 
  by Sharpe J.A., has recently developed a number of criteria to be applied when 
  considering whether an Ontario court should assume jurisdiction over a foreign 
  defendant: see Muscutt v. Courcelles (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 20; Lemmex v Bernard 
  (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 54; Gajraj v. DeBernardo (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 68; Sinclair 
  v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (2002) 60 O.R. (3d) 76; and Leufkens 
  v. Alba Tours International Inc. (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 84. Muscutt is the leading 
  decision, and I shall refer to the jurisdictional principles expressed in those 
  cases as the Muscutt principles or criteria. </p>
<p>
  [12] Although the list is not intended to be exhaustive, the factors to be taken 
  into account by a court when deciding whether there is a sufficiently real and 
  substantial connection to Ontario to warrant the assumption of jurisdiction 
  over a foreign defendant are the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) the connection between the plaintiff's claim and Ontario;</p>
<p>
  (b) the connection between the forum and the defendant;</p>
<p>
  (c) unfairness to the defendant in the Ontario court assuming jurisdiction;</p>
<p>
  (d) unfairness to the plaintiff in the Ontario court assuming jurisdiction;</p>
<p>
  (e) the involvement of other parties to the suit;</p>
<p>
  (f) the Ontario court's willingness to recognize and enforce an extra-provincial 
  judgment rendered on the same jurisdictional basis;</p>
<p>
  (g) whether the case is inter-provincial or international in nature; and</p>
<p>
  (h) comity and the standards of jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement prevailing 
  elsewhere.</p>
<p>
  [13] As Sharpe J.A. noted in Muscutt, supra, at paragraphs 75 and 76, no single 
  factor is determinative and all relevant factors should be considered and weighed 
  together: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is apparent from Morguard, Hunt and subsequent case law that it is not possible 
  to reduce the real and substantial connection test to a fixed formula. A considerable 
  measure of judgment is required in assessing whether the real and substantial 
  connection test has been met on the facts of a given case. Flexibility is therefore 
  important.</p>
<p>
  [14] In very thorough and careful reasons, the motions judge canvassed each 
  of the foregoing factors in light of the evidence in the record before her. 
  Although recognizing that the matter was "admittedly not clear-cut" 
  and that some of the criteria worked in favour of the appellants, she concluded 
  that the majority of the factors favoured the Ontario court assuming jurisdiction 
  and, in particular, that "the multiplicity of parties in this case [tipped] 
  the scales in favour" of that result. Coupled with all of these considerations, 
  the motions judge was of the view that "the underlying principles of order 
  and fairness [were] best suited if the entire case is tried in Ontario, eliminating 
  the risk of inconsistent findings".</p>
<p>
  [15] With one minor caveat - which relates more to how she arrived at her conclusion 
  respecting one of the factors to be considered, rather than to the conclusion 
  itself - I agree with the analysis of the motions judge regarding the application 
  of the Muscutt principles in the circumstances of this case</p>
<p>
  [16] The caveat is the following. In considering the connection between the 
  plaintiffs and Ontario as the forum for the litigation, the motions judge expressed 
  the view that the plaintiffs had suffered damages in Ontario as a result of 
  the alleged negligence of Emery because the Michigan judgment would be enforced 
  in Ontario. She held that "while Emery's negligence might have injured 
  Jones in Michigan and outside of Ontario, that injury will result in damage 
  inside Ontario when the adverse judgment, the result of that negligence, is 
  enforced in Ontario". She relied upon Jaffe v. Dearing (1988), 65 O.R. 
  (2d) 113 (H.C.J.) for the proposition that "the damage was sustained - 
  in the sense that it was felt or it hit home and was endured - in Ontario".</p>
<p>
  [17] With respect, I have some doubt about the logic of this approach. It appears 
  to me to confuse damages with enforcement of the judgment. The plaintiffs' "damages" 
  were incurred in Michigan, where they failed to prevail in the lawsuit. In my 
  opinion, the mere fact the Michigan judgment may be enforced against Jones' 
  assets in Ontario - and thus be "felt or hit home and [be] endured" 
  in Ontario - does not constitute "damage sustained in Ontario" for 
  purposes of an action in Ontario against an ex juris defendant. </p>
<p>
  [18] Jaffe, supra, is distinguishable. There, the monies which had been posted 
  as an appearance bond in Florida proceedings, and which were forfeited to the 
  state when Mr. Jaffe failed to attend for his trial, had come from Ontario. 
  It made sense to conclude that the loss of those monies "hit home" 
  in Ontario. But such is not the case with the enforcement of a foreign judgment 
  in Ontario. Damages sustained and payment of those damages, are not the same 
  thing.</p>
<p>
  [19] It does not follow, however, that the potential enforcement of the Michigan 
  judgment in Ontario is an irrelevant consideration regarding the connection 
  between the plaintiffs and Ontario as the forum for determination of the plaintiffs' 
  claims. The judgment is at the heart of the claim against the appellants, who 
  assert that they would not be exposed to payment of it, were it not for the 
  negligence of the defendants, including the appellants. In the context of this 
  litigation, then, the potential enforcement of the judgment is a connecting 
  factor between the plaintiffs and the Ontario forum, and one properly taken 
  into account in assessing the assumption of jurisdiction issue.</p>
<p>
  [20] In any event, while an Ontario court is more likely to assert jurisdiction 
  over a claim where the plaintiff has suffered damages in Ontario, such damages 
  are only one of a myriad of factors that may signal a connection between the 
  forum and the plaintiffs' claims. Here, other factors tending to show such a 
  connection include the following: all parties except the appellants are resident 
  in Ontario; all relevant contracts between the parties, including the appellant's 
  retainer agreement, were concluded in Ontario; the appellants knew they were 
  representing clients whose business was carried on from Ontario; and Emery dealt 
  with Jones by telephone in Ontario and even met with Jones on one occasion to 
  obtain instructions in Welland.</p>
<p>
  [21] Moreover, the connection between the forum and the plaintiffs' claims is 
  only one of the several Muscutt criteria to be considered. The motions judge 
  balanced all of the relevant factors. In particular, she focused on the numerous 
  parties involved in the lawsuit - all of whom, save for the appellants, are 
  located in Ontario - and the need to avoid multiplicity of proceedings and the 
  potential for inconsistent decisions in the courts of two jurisdiction. In my 
  view, the motions judge was right to emphasize these factors, in the circumstances 
  of this case, and to conclude that they tipped the balance in favour of assuming 
  jurisdiction. The appellants' conduct in defending the Michigan action and the 
  scope of its retainer, including whether that retainer encompassed the obligation 
  to advise the plaintiffs of potential coverage problems, are central issues 
  in the lawsuit, and are inextricably linked to all of the claims and cross-claims. 
  </p>
<p>
  [22] In an action with multiple defendants and multiple claims, some of which 
  have an extra-territorial dimension, the claims must be assessed as a whole, 
  for purposes of the jurisdictional analysis, without treating the claim against 
  the foreign defendant as a separate action: McNichol Estate v. Woldnik (2001), 
  13 C.P.C. (5th) 61 (Ont. C.A.); Muscutt, supra, at paras. 67-68; Incorporated 
  Broadcasters Ltd. v. Canwest Global Communications Corp. (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 
  431 at para. 38 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [23] In McNichol Estate Goudge J.A. stated, at pp. 64-65: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Rather, I think that the approach prescribed by Morguard and Hunt requires the 
  court to evaluate the connection with Ontario of the subject matter of the litigation 
  framed as it is to include both the claim against the foreign defendant and 
  the claims against the domestic defendants. In doing so, the courts must be 
  guided by these requirements of order and fairness. If it serves these requirements 
  to try the foreign claim together with the claims that are clearly rooted in 
  Ontario, then the foreign claim meets the "real and substantial connection" 
  test. This is so even if that claim would fail the test if it were constituted 
  as a separate action. This approach goes beyond showing that the foreign defendant 
  is a proper party to the litigation. It rests on those values, namely order 
  and fairness, that properly inform the real and substantial connection test 
  and allows the court the flexibility to balance the globalization of litigation 
  against the problems for a defendant who is sued in a foreign jurisdiction.</p>
<p>[24] That is precisely the approach taken by the motions judge in this case. 
  There is ample support in the record for her conclusion that Ontario has jurisdiction 
  over the plaintiffs' claims against the appellants, and I would not interfere 
  with that decision.</p>
<p>
  Forum Non Conveniens</p>
<p>
  [25] Having concluded that the Ontario court has jurisdiction to hear the claim 
  against the appellants, the motions judge turned her mind to the question whether 
  the Ontario court should do so, i.e., to whether the court should decline to 
  exercise that jurisdiction on the basis of the principle of forum non conveniens. 
  She held that the court should exercise its jurisdiction over the dispute.</p>
<p>
  [26] The jurisprudence establishes, as Sharpe J.A. noted in Muscutt, supra, 
  at para. 40, that "[w]here more than one forum is capable of assuming jurisdiction, 
  the most appropriate forum is determined through the forum non conveniens doctrine, 
  which allows a court to decline to exercise its jurisdiction on the ground that 
  there is another forum more appropriate to entertain the action." In the 
  context of this case, it must be shown that Michigan is clearly the more appropriate 
  forum, in order to displace the forum selected by the plaintiffs: Amchem Products 
  Inc. v. British Columbia (Workers' Compensation Board), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897 
  at 923; Frymer v. Brettschneider (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 60 at 79 (C.A.). The order 
  is discretionary.</p>
<p>
  [27] The appellants argue that the motions judge erred in placing the onus on 
  them to establish that Michigan is clearly the more appropriate forum, rather 
  than Ontario, for the resolution of the dispute. With respect to the motions 
  judge, I agree that she erred in this regard. She proceeded on the basis that 
  it was the defendant appellants who had the onus of showing that Michigan was 
  the more appropriate forum and concluded that Emery had failed to do so. In 
  Ontario, however, the onus is on the plaintiff who has brought the foreigner 
  into the jurisdiction to establish that this province is the appropriate forum 
  when the choice of forum is challenged: Frymer, supra, at pp. 84-85.</p>
<p>
  [28] Nevertheless, as Arbour J.A. pointed out in Frymer, at p. 81: </p>
<p class="indent">
  . . . the question of burden of proof will rarely matter. The choice of the 
  appropriate forum will generally resolve itself on the basis of the relative 
  strength of the relevant factors, rather than on the determination of who is 
  to bear the burden of proof.</p>
<p> See also Amchem, supra, per Sopinka J. at p. 921.</p>
<p>
  [29] That is true in the present case, in my opinion.</p>
<p>
  [30] As she was obliged to do, the motions judge considered all of the relevant 
  factors in assessing the forum non conveniens argument, namely, (1) the location 
  of the majority of the parties, (2) the location of key witnesses and evidence, 
  (3) contractual provisions that specify applicable law or accord jurisdiction 
  (there are no such provisions here), (4) the avoidance of multiplicity of proceedings, 
  (5) the applicable law and its weight in comparison to the factual questions 
  to be decided, (6) geographical factors suggesting the natural forum, and (7) 
  whether declining jurisdiction would deprive the plaintiff of a legitimate juridical 
  advantage available in the domestic court: see Muscutt, supra, at para. 41. 
  </p>
<p>
  [31] The motions judge weighed and balanced all of these factors. At para. 55 
  of her decision she said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Factor 1 clearly favours Ontario since all parties except Emery are in this 
  province. Since most parties are in Ontario, most of the witnesses and evidence 
  are likely in Ontario as well. I appreciate that any experts on Michigan law 
  will likely come from Michigan. Factor 2 is thus either neutral or slightly 
  favours Ontario. Factor 3 is neutral since no such contractual provisions exist. 
  Factor 4 clearly favours Ontario for the reasons discussed above. Since the 
  case deals with both Ontario and Michigan law, factor 5 is neutral. While factor 
  6 may favour Michigan, the distance between the jurisdictions is small enough 
  to cause little concern about hearing the case in Ontario. Finally, as to the 
  final factor, Jones would not lose a juridical advantage if the case were heard 
  in Michigan, aside from the concerns surrounding the multiplicity of parties 
  discussed earlier.</p>
<p>[32] In the end, the motions judge concluded that only two of the factors favoured 
  Michigan, and then only slightly. I agree. In my view, this is not a case that 
  turns on who has the onus of establishing whether Michigan is clearly the more 
  appropriate forum.</p>
<p>
  [33] I would therefore not interfere with the exercise of the motion judge's 
  discretion on the forum non conveniens argument.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [34] I would accordingly dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [35] At the conclusion of argument counsel indicated that if the appellants 
  were unsuccessful costs should be awarded against them in the following amounts: 
  $4,500 in favour of the plaintiffs; $4,000 in favour of Kingsway; and $3,500 
  in favour of Fish, such amounts to be all inclusive. The court requested written 
  submissions respecting costs in the event that the appellants should be successful. 
  We have received such submissions, during the course of which some differences 
  emerged over whether counsel had agreed unconditionally to the foregoing amounts, 
  if the appellants failed, or whether the agreement was conditional upon agreement 
  being made concerning the appellant's costs if successful. It is not necessary 
  for us to resolve this dispute. We are satisfied that the foregoing amounts 
  are reasonable and the costs of the appeal are therefore fixed in those amounts.</p>
