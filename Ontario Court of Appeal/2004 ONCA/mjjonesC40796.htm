<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The insurer appeals from a Rule 20 summary judgment decision allowing the 
  insured's claim for the loss of a boat.</p>
<p>[2] While the insured had its boat stored at a marina, the marina sold the 
  boat without the insured's authority, knowledge, or consent. The purchaser was 
  an innocent third party. When the insured claimed on its "all risks" 
  insurance policy for the "direct physical loss" of the boat, the insurer 
  denied coverage. Instead, it advised the insured to sue the innocent purchaser. 
</p>
<p>[3] The insured sued, and lost, both at trial and on appeal. Under the Factors 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990 c. F.1., the court found that the marina held the boat as a 
  mercantile agent and, as such, had the power to pass valid title to an innocent 
  third party who had bought it in good faith. See M.J. Jones Inc. v. Henry (2002), 
  58 O.R. (3d ) 529 (C.A.).</p>
<p>[4] After losing its action against the innocent third party, the insured claimed 
  on its insurance policy and, when coverage was denied, successfully sued the 
  insurer to recover its loss. The insurer appeals that decision on the basis 
  that the trial judge erred in finding that an insured peril was the proximate 
  cause of the insured's loss. </p>
<p>[5] The insurer argues that the proximate cause of the loss was not the action 
  of the "rogue" marina, but the transfer of valid title to the third 
  party. To put it another way, the insured would not have suffered the loss "but 
  for" the acquisition of title by a third party; it was the change in title 
  that precluded the insured from recovering the boat. Further, the insurer argues, 
  the insured did not suffer a "direct physical loss" of the boat, but 
  only lost the proceeds for which it was sold.</p>
<p>[6] We disagree. The cause of the loss was the conversion of the boat by the 
  marina. It is irrelevant that, subsequent to that conversion, title to the boat 
  was acquired by an innocent purchaser. The taking of title by the innocent third 
  party was merely a by-product of the conversion and not the cause of the loss. 
  In other words, a finding that the boat was validly transferred to an innocent 
  purchaser is not incompatible with a finding that the marina unlawfully converted 
  the boat. </p>
<p>[7] The insured concedes that the policy would have covered theft of the boat 
  by a third party. We see no distinction between theft of the boat by a third 
  party and the unlawful conversion of the boat by the marina. Both events are 
  "accidental" in the sense that they were unexpected and unforeseen. 
  Both are equally fortuitous. See C.C.R. Fishing Ltd. v. British Reserve Insurance 
  Company, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 814 at 825. Both result in the insured incurring the 
  "direct physical loss" of the boat.</p>
<p>[8] This is not a case where the insured asks for compensation for the marina's 
  failure to account for the proceeds of the sale of the boat. If it was, there 
  would not be coverage. Under the policy, the insurer insured the boat, and not 
  the proceeds of its sale. It is not an accounting, however, that the insured 
  seeks. Rather, it requests coverage for the "direct physical loss" 
  of the boat, a loss we find was caused by the marina's conversion of the boat.</p>
<p>[9] In the result, we agree with the trial judge that the insured is entitled 
  to judgment against the insurer. The appeal is dismissed. The respondent is 
  entitled to its costs of the appeal fixed in the agreed-upon amount of $3,000, 
  inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
