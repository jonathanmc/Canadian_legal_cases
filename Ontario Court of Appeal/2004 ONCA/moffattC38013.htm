<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Although the appellant's submissions were framed in terms of errors of 
  law, fundamentally, the appellant argues that the trial judge misapprehended 
  the evidence. The alleged misapprehension of evidence relates, in particular, 
  to whether the appellant was told that the building was not to involve post 
  and beam construction and whether the draft plans produced by the appellant's 
  engineer were consistent with the understanding of the parties. In our view, 
  the trial judge did not misapprehend the evidence on these two issues or the 
  other matters argued by the appellant.</p>
<p>[2] There was evidence, especially from Mr. Bice, from which the trial judge 
  could find that the appellant knew that the building was not to include post 
  and beam construction and any structural steel. The appellant's own quote is 
  entirely inconsistent with the theory that a post and beam construction would 
  have been acceptable. We therefore cannot accept the appellant's principal submission 
  that the parties were never ad idem on the fundamental terms of the contract.</p>
<p>[3] We are also satisfied that it was open to the trial judge to find that 
  the appellant breached the contract. Mr. Maodus's evidence was that he felt 
  entitled to unilaterally change the design and he produced drawings accordingly. 
  The appellant's delivery of draft drawings employing post and beam construction 
  rather than using the construction technique contracted for was a breach of 
  contract. We agree with the trial judge that the &quot;subject to&quot; clause 
  was not a true condition precedent.</p>
<p>[4] Finally, we agree with the trial judge's determination of the measure of 
  damages. The damages were not limited to the difference between the fees charged 
  by Mr. Maodus and those charged by Mr. Lapin. The appellant was entitled to 
  be put in the position it would have been had the appellant not breached the 
  contract. There was no suggestion that the respondent did not properly mitigate 
  its damages.</p>
<p>[5] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $15,000 inclusive 
  of disbursements and G.S.T. </p>
