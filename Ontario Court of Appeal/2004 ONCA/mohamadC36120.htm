<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice Arthur C. Whealy of the Superior 
  Court of Justice on March 1, 2001 and the sentence imposed on March 30, 2001.</p>
<p>
  CRONK J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant was convicted of two counts of possession of property obtained 
  by crime in excess of $5,000 relating to a stolen GMC Yukon truck and a Plymouth 
  van. He was acquitted of a similar third count relating to a Dodge van. He was 
  sentenced to 90 days in jail to be served intermittently, followed by three 
  years probation. One of the terms of his probation required the appellant to 
  make restitution to two insurance companies in the total amount of $20,000 at 
  the rate of $1,000 per month. The appellant appeals his convictions and sentence.</p>
<p>
  I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [2] In early June 1999, a Canada Customs official, who was assigned to provincial 
  auto theft duties, became suspicious that a GMC Yukon truck that was scheduled 
  for exportation to Amsterdam may have been stolen. The customs exportation documents 
  identified Viamar Scilla Transport International Inc. ("VST Inc.") 
  as the shipping com-pany. The documents also listed 1307109 Ontario Ltd. as 
  the owner of the vehicle, with an address of 703 Fenmar Drive, North York. </p>
<p>
  [3] The customs official opened the shipping container and examined the Yukon 
  truck. He determined that it bore a legitimate vehicle identification number 
  ("VIN"). He also learned, however, that duplicate ownership documents 
  listing the 703 Fenmar Drive address had been issued for a Yukon truck with 
  the same VIN as the VIN on the truck scheduled for delivery to Amsterdam. The 
  customs official attended at the 703 Fenmar Drive premises, which consisted 
  of a commercial building containing several businesses, including a used car 
  business, large garages and an outdoor parking lot. Potros Jebo operated the 
  used car business at that location. </p>
<p>
  [4] The customs official observed a Yukon truck on the premises that had the 
  same VIN as the VIN declared in the exportation documents for the Yukon truck 
  scheduled to be shipped to Europe. He then contacted the police. </p>
<p>
  [5] On June 3, 1999, the customs official again attended at the Fenmar Drive 
  location, this time accompanied by Detective Dan Dyett, a member of the automobile 
  squad of the Toronto Police Services. After observing the premises and the parking 
  lot, Dyett noticed a Yukon truck being driven to the front of the building. 
  Dyett blocked the vehicle with his car and spoke to the driver who informed 
  him that the truck belonged to Jebo. Dyett observed that a VIN was glued to 
  the dashboard of the truck, instead of being affixed with steel rivets in accordance 
  with original manufacturer standards. He also noticed that the VIN of a Plymouth 
  van, which was parked next to the Yukon truck, was also glued to that vehicle's 
  dashboard. Dyett concluded that the original VINs had been removed and that 
  false VINs had been attached to the dashboards of both vehicles. He confronted 
  Jebo and told him that both vehicles were stolen. Jebo claimed ownership of 
  the two vehicles and said that he had purchased them at auction. He denied any 
  knowledge that they were stolen. Dyett arrested Jebo, charging him with two 
  counts of possession of stolen property. </p>
<p>
  [6] Dyett called for police assistance and ordered two tow trucks to attend 
  the scene to remove the Yukon truck and the Plymouth van for forensic examination. 
  He then turned his attention to the Plymouth van. </p>
<p>
  [7] The van was unlocked and the keys to the van were in the ignition. Dyett 
  entered the van and observed a briefcase in the back seat. He took a cursory 
  look inside the briefcase and saw identification documents in the name of the 
  appellant. Because he was the only police officer on the scene, Dyett then left 
  the van for a brief period to secure Jebo's business premises. He returned shortly 
  thereafter and began to again look through the contents of the briefcase. As 
  he started to do so, the first tow truck arrived. Almost at the same time, Dyett 
  was approached by the appellant, who apparently was known to Dyett. A conversation 
  ensued during which the appellant told Dyett that the briefcase belonged to 
  him. He claimed that he had forgotten the briefcase in the van after test-driving 
  the vehicle an hour or so earlier. Dyett asked him what he knew about the van 
  and the appellant told him that he was going to buy it. When asked from whom 
  he was going to purchase the van, the appellant gestured towards 703 Fenmar 
  Drive. Dyett continued to look through the contents of the briefcase and discovered 
  a dealer's licence plate, air tickets to Amsterdam in the name of the appellant 
  and others, and documents concerning the shipping of a Dodge van to Amsterdam. 
  The appellant acknowledged that the dealer's licence plate was his.</p>
<p>
  [8] Dyett then left to give instructions to the tow truck driver. After a few 
  seconds, he turned back to the van and the customs officer informed him that 
  the appellant had removed the briefcase from the van and was entering a neighbouring 
  building at 705 Fenmar Drive. Dyett immediately entered the building, located 
  the appellant, and told him that the briefcase had been in a stolen vehicle. 
  Dyett told the appellant to return the briefcase to the van to permit him to 
  review all of its contents and that after it had been searched the appellant 
  could leave with the briefcase. </p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant returned the briefcase to the van, and Dyett recommenced his 
  search of its contents. He found a large sealed envelope in the briefcase, which 
  contained two smaller sealed envelopes. The three envelopes contained counterfeit 
  VIN plates for five vehicles and counterfeit stickers and parts and certification 
  labels used to renumber and "legitimize" stolen vehicles. One of the 
  VIN plates matched the VIN plate affixed to the Yukon truck found in Jebo's 
  parking lot. It also duplicated the VIN plate on the Yukon truck scheduled for 
  exportation to Amsterdam. The appellant denied any knowledge of the plates, 
  stickers and labels and claimed that he did not know how they came to be in 
  his briefcase. </p>
<p>
  [10] Dyett found several other items in the appellant's briefcase including: 
  (i) the appellant's passport and driver's licence; (ii) a blank cheque for Four 
  M &amp; H Auto Ltd., a company operated by the appellant, listing an address 
  of 705 Fenmar Drive; (iii) a VST Inc. shipping bill for a 1998 Yukon vehicle 
  being shipped by Jebo's company to Dubai; (iv) a reference letter for one of 
  Jebo's employees on the letterhead of Jebo's used car business at the Fenmar 
  Drive premises; (v) a telephone bill for an account in Jebo's name; and (vi) 
  numerous additional shipping documents concerning other vehicles being shipped 
  by VST Inc. In at least two instances, the latter documents pertained to vehicles 
  bearing VINs identical to the VIN plates found in the envelopes inside the appellant's 
  briefcase. </p>
<p>
  [11] Dyett arrested the appellant and charged him with two counts of possession 
  of property obtained by crime in excess of $5,000 relating to the GMC Yukon 
  truck and the Plymouth van. He was subsequently charged, together with Jebo, 
  with one additional count of possession of stolen property in relation to a 
  Dodge van that was also discovered on Jebo's premises. </p>
<p>
  [12] Jebo pleaded guilty to the three counts against him and was sentenced on 
  June 8, 2001 to a conditional sentence of one year to be served in the community 
  followed by two years probation. He was also ordered to make restitution in 
  the total amount of $20,000 to the two insurance companies. </p>
<p>
  [13] At his trial, the appellant challenged the admissibility of the evidence 
  flowing from Dyett's search of his briefcase. That evidence was critical to 
  the Crown's circum-stantial case against the appellant. Without it, the Crown 
  had no way to link the appellant to the stolen vehicles. </p>
<p>
  [14] At a voir dire held to determine the admissibility of this evidence, the 
  appellant argued that Dyett had no authority to open or search the briefcase 
  after he learned that it was owned by the appellant because the appellant had 
  not been arrested, he was not a suspect in any crime and, until the briefcase 
  was opened, no basis existed for the issuance of a search warrant. The appellant 
  asserted that the warrantless search of the briefcase infringed his right under 
  s. 8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to be free from unreasonable search 
  or seizure and that the evidence flowing from the search should be excluded 
  from his trial.</p>
<p>
  [15] The Crown asserted that Dyett was authorized to search the van and its 
  contents as an incident to the arrest of Jebo, that Dyett had a duty to discover 
  and preserve evidence and that, having examined the contents of the briefcase, 
  Dyett had reasonable grounds to arrest the appellant as a party to the same 
  offences as Jebo. Accordingly, as the search of the briefcase was lawful, the 
  Crown maintained that the evidence concerning the contents of the briefcase 
  was admissible.</p>
<p>
  [16] The trial judge accepted the Crown's position. He found no violation of 
  s. 8 of the Charter. In his ruling on the voir dire dated February 26, 2001, 
  he stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am of the view&#133;that it is not clear there has even been a Charter breach 
  of the [appellant's] Section 8 rights. It is clear that Dyett had the authority, 
  as an incident of the arrest of Jebo, to discover and preserve any evidence. 
  He had seized the stolen van and had a duty to inspect it and its contents for 
  that purpose. Had the [appellant] not appeared on the scene when he did, the 
  contents of the briefcase would have been discovered in any event and inevitably 
  led to the investigation of him because his passport was in the middle of the 
  incriminating material. Did his appearance on the scene and claim of ownership 
  of the briefcase alter the scope of Dyett's authority? I think not. The [appellant] 
  was not a passenger in the van, in possession of the briefcase and asserting 
  control over it simultaneously. He was, by his own admission, in the act of 
  attempting to regain possession. I am of the opinion Dyett had authority, in 
  these circumstances, to deny the [appellant] possession, at the same time as 
  con-ceding ownership.</p>
<p>
  [17] The trial judge also held that if he was wrong to conclude that no breach 
  of s. 8 of the Charter had occurred, the evidence concerning the contents of 
  the briefcase should not be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  [18] The Crown called two witnesses at trial: the customs officer and Detective 
  Dyett. The defence also called only two witnesses: Jebo and the appellant. Jebo 
  testified that the appellant had purchased vehicles from him in the past. Jebo 
  also confirmed that the appellant had test-driven the Plymouth van earlier on 
  the day of his arrest, and that he had indicated a desire to purchase the van 
  when he returned it. Jebo claimed that, thereafter, he checked the van and found 
  the appellant's briefcase on the front seat and a sealed envelope on the floor 
  of the van. According to Jebo, he placed the envelope in the appellant's briefcase. 
  </p>
<p>
  [19] Jebo also testified at trial that he knew that the Yukon truck and the 
  Plymouth van were stolen. He said that he provided downpayments for both vehicles 
  to a third party vendor, about whom he knew little, who subsequently informed 
  him that the vehicles were stolen. When questioned on cross-examination regarding 
  what he did when he learned that the vehicles were stolen, Jebo claimed, for 
  the first time, that he considered contacting the police but did not do so because 
  the vendor had threatened to kill him or members of his family if he did. </p>
<p>
  [20] In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge rejected Jebo's evidence, 
  concluding that it was "quite unbelievable" and that Jebo "is 
  a thoroughly dishonest person". </p>
<p>
  II. CONVICTION APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant raises four grounds of appeal. He argues that the trial judge 
  erred: (i) in admitting the evidence obtained from the search of his briefcase; 
  (ii) in rejecting the evidence of Jebo, thereby resulting in unreasonable verdicts; 
  (iii) in concluding that the appellant had constructive possession of the stolen 
  motor vehicles; and (iv) in misapprehending the evidence. </p>
<p>
  (1) The Search of the Briefcase</p>
<p>
  [22] Section 8 of the Charter guarantees the right to be secure against unreasonable 
  search or seizure. It protects against unreasonable state interference with 
  reasonable expectations of privacy: Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 
  145. The challenge of the legality of a police search requires consideration 
  whether the accused had a reason-able expectation of privacy and, if he had 
  such an expectation, whether the search by the police was conducted reasonably: 
  R. v. Edwards, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128 and R. v. Belnavis, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 341.</p>
<p>
  (i) Reasonable Expectation of Privacy</p>
<p>
  [23] In his reasons on the voir dire, the trial judge did not expressly address 
  the issue whether the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the 
  contents of his briefcase. The existence of a reasonable expectation of privacy 
  depends on a contextual analysis of the totality of the circumstances: Edwards 
  at para. 31 and Belnavis at para. 20. The courts have recognized that there 
  is a lesser expectation of privacy in a car than there is in one's home or office, 
  or with respect to an individual's physical person: R. v. Caslake, [1998] 1 
  S.C.R. 51. In this case, the appellant does not assert a reasonable expectation 
  of privacy in the stolen Plymouth van but, rather, in the contents of the brief-case 
  contained within the van. </p>
<p>
  [24] During oral argument of this appeal, Crown counsel acknowledged that the 
  appellant had some reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his 
  briefcase. I agree. </p>
<p>
  [25] In the contemporary context, briefcases often house highly confidential 
  personal and business information. They can serve, in a practical sense, as 
  portable offices for their owners. In my view, owners of briefcases generally 
  have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of their briefcases.</p>
<p>
  [26] There may also be circumstances in which some reasonable expectation of 
  privacy in property exists even if the property has been reported stolen. In 
  R. v. Law, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 227, the accused restaurant owners reported the theft 
  of a safe from their business premises to the police. After the police recovered 
  the safe, a police officer, who had not been involved in the investigation of 
  its theft, inspected the contents of the safe on the suspicion that the accused 
  had not remitted owed taxes to Revenue Canada. He photocopied documents found 
  in the safe and forwarded the copied documents to Revenue Canada. The photocopied 
  evidence led to charges against the accused for alleged failure to remit goods 
  and services taxes when due. In considering whether the accused had a reasonable 
  expectation of privacy in the stolen safe, thereby triggering the protection 
  afforded by s. 8 of the Charter, Bastarache J. reasoned at para. 18: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In this case, the appellants did not voluntarily discard their private documents. 
  On the contrary, the documents were locked in a safe that was stolen out of 
  their place of business and left abandoned by the thieves in an open field. 
  Moreover, the theft of the safe was reported to the police the morning it occurred, 
  well before it was recovered. One can therefore infer the existence of a subjective 
  expectation of privacy: Edwards, supra. In this entire context, I cannot but 
  conclude that the appellants retained a residual, but limited, reasonable expectation 
  of privacy in the contents of their stolen safe. In short, one would have expected 
  the stolen property to remain private following its recovery, as it was before 
  its theft [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [27] There is no suggestion here that the appellant intended to voluntarily 
  relinquish, abandon or discard his briefcase. To the contrary, he claimed that 
  after he test-drove the vehicle with a view to purchasing it, he inadvertently 
  left the briefcase in the Plymouth van. In these circumstances, he asserted, 
  he preserved his expectation of privacy in the contents of the briefcase. The 
  Crown did not vigorously challenge this defence position. Rather, the Crown 
  maintained on the voir dire and before this court that the search of the contents 
  of the briefcase was lawful under the common law power of search incident to 
  arrest. The trial judge's ruling that no breach of s. 8 of the Charter had occurred 
  was based on his conclusion that Dyett had authority to search the briefcase 
  in the circumstances. I turn now to that issue.</p>
<p>
  (ii) Search Incident to Arrest</p>
<p>
  [28] Search incident to arrest does not require a warrant or independent reasonable 
  and probable grounds for the search. In those respects, it is an exception to 
  the ordinary requirements for a reasonable search. Rather, the right to search 
  derives from the fact of the arrest, which itself requires reasonable and probable 
  grounds or an arrest warrant. If the arrest is unlawful, the search is also 
  unlawful: Caslake, supra, at para. 13. </p>
<p>
  [29] In Cloutier v. Langlois, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 158 at paras. 60-62, the Supreme 
  Court of Canada identified important limits on the power to search incident 
  to arrest. They include the following: (i) because the police have some discretion 
  in conducting such a search, they must be in a position to assess the circumstances 
  of the case so as to determine whether a search meets the underlying objectives; 
  (ii) the purpose of the search must be related to the objectives of the proper 
  administration of justice; and (iii) the search must not be conducted in an 
  abusive manner. In discussing these limits, Lamer C.J.C. commented in Caslake 
  at para. 17: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In my view, all of the limits on search incident to arrest are derived from 
  the justification for the common law power itself: searches which derive their 
  legal authority from the fact of arrest must be truly incidental to the arrest 
  in question. The authority for the search does not arise as a result of a reduced 
  expectation of privacy of the arrested individual. Rather, it arises out of 
  a need for the law enforce-ment authorities to gain control of things or information 
  which outweighs the individual's interest in privacy&#133;This means, simply 
  put, that the search is only justifiable if the purpose of the search is related 
  to the purpose of the arrest [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [30] Thus, in order to lawfully undertake a search incident to arrest, the purpose 
  of the search must be connected to the arrest. Lamer C.J.C. elaborated in Caslake 
  at para. 19 on the meaning of this restriction: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Whether [some valid purpose connected to the arrest] exists will depend on what 
  the police were looking for and why. There are both subjective and objective 
  aspects to this issue. In my view, the police must have one of the purposes 
  for a valid search incident to arrest in mind when the search is conducted. 
  Further, the officer's belief that this purpose will be served by the search 
  must be a reasonable one.</p>
<p>
  [31] The appellant does not dispute that Jebo's arrest was lawful or that the 
  police had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the Plymouth van 
  had been stolen. Nor does the appellant contend that the search of the briefcase 
  was unreasonable in the sense that it was conducted in an abusive fashion or 
  that the three occasions on which Dyett inspected the contents of the briefcase 
  constitute three discrete warrantless searches of the briefcase. Rather, he 
  submits that from the time that the appellant claimed ownership of the briefcase, 
  the search of the contents of the briefcase was unreasonable and exceeded the 
  scope of the power to search as an incident to arrest because Dyett lacked subjective 
  and objective grounds to believe that the appellant, in contrast to Jebo, was 
  connected to the commission of a criminal offence or that the briefcase might 
  contain evidence of a theft. Accordingly, he maintains, it was incumbent on 
  Dyett to attempt to obtain a warrant before searching the briefcase. I would 
  not give effect to these submissions. </p>
<p>
  [32] The legitimate purposes of search incident to arrest extend to the protection 
  of evidence from destruction at the hands of the arrestee or others and to the 
  discovery of evidence that can be used at the arrestee's trial: Cloutier, supra, 
  at para. 61. In R. v. Spinelli (1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at para. 36 (B.C.C.A.), 
  Southin J.A. said in connection with the search of a vehicle that had been reported 
  to the police as stolen: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am not saying that the police, upon recovering a vehicle reported stolen, 
  have an unrestricted right to search the vehicle and its contents with a view 
  to ascertaining whether the owner possibly has committed some crime. But to 
  look in it for evidence which might lead to the apprehension of the thief is 
  not a breach of the owner's rights. As between the Crown and the thief, the 
  vehicle is real evidence [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [33] Dyett testified that he looked in the briefcase for the purpose of locating 
  evidence concerning the theft of the Plymouth van and the scheme employed to 
  carry out the "re-VINing" of the stolen vehicles. The following exchange 
  occurred during the voir dire between Dyett and trial counsel for the Crown: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And what officer was your purpose and objective in looking 
  through that briefcase, please?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Well, it was in the stolen white van, so I figured you know 
  for evidence relating to the theft of the vehicle and the way they - - Mr. Jebo 
  or whoever was renumbering the vehicles, VIN plates for any paperwork relating 
  to other vehicles.</p>
<p>
  [34] On cross-examination during the voir dire, Dyett was asked why he continued 
  to look through the briefcase after the appellant had claimed ownership of it. 
  He gave this evidence: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And if I understand you correctly, the reason why you continue 
  to look through the briefcase is that it was located in a stolen van?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. So you feel you had the right to look through the briefcase?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And the reason why you look through the briefcase is that 
  you have a suspicion that it might contain some evidence of a theft?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. All right. And again, he asserts ownership over it. He says 
  to you, it is mine and you told him, "Put it back. First I will look through 
  it and then you can go."</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And you then proceeded to look through it again?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes, sir.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And your reason is because you have a suspicion that there 
  might be some type of evidence of a theft?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Well, it was in the stolen van.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. All right.</p>
<p class="indent">A. And they had already arrested the - </p>
<p class="indent">Q. Mr. Jebo?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes, sir.</p>
<p>
  [35] In response to a question of him by the trial judge, Dyett also said that 
  by the time that he opened the briefcase for the second time, after securing 
  Jebo's premises, he had "seized" the van. He had arrested Jebo, secured 
  Jebo's premises, determined that the van was stolen and called for police assistance 
  and for tow trucks to remove the van and the Yukon truck. Dyett felt that the 
  van was stolen and was not going anywhere. </p>
<p>
  [36] The trial judge accepted Dyett's evidence and held, as I have said, that: 
  "It is clear that Dyett had the authority, as an incident of the arrest 
  of Jebo, to discover and preserve any evidence. He had seized the stolen van 
  and had a duty to inspect it and its contents for that purpose." I agree.</p>
<p>
  [37] Dyett had one of the purposes of a valid search incident to arrest in mind 
  when he conducted his search of the briefcase, that is, the discovery of evidence 
  concerning the charges against Jebo. It was open to the trial judge to accept 
  Dyett's assertion of a bona fide subjective belief that he was authorized to 
  search the briefcase for that law enforcement purpose. There is no suggestion 
  that Dyett's belief changed at any point throughout the occasions when he searched 
  the contents of the briefcase. </p>
<p>
  [38] In my view, Dyett's subjective belief that searching the contents of the 
  briefcase might lead to the discovery of evidence concerning the charges against 
  Jebo was a reasonable one in all of the circumstances. The Plymouth van, which 
  contained the briefcase, was directly implicated in the charges against Jebo. 
  The van and the briefcase were located on the premises where Jebo was arrested 
  and Dyett searched the contents of the briefcase a short time after Jebo's arrest. 
  The search of the briefcase, therefore, was closely connected to the arrest 
  of Jebo.</p>
<p>
  [39] Viewed in that context, I agree with the trial judge that the appellant's 
  attendance at the van and his claim to ownership of the briefcase did not "alter 
  the scope of Dyett's authority" to search the briefcase. Although Dyett 
  knew the appellant from "the past", the record before us does not 
  indicate how he came to know the appellant or how well he knew him. There is 
  no suggestion that his prior knowledge of the appellant was sufficient to persuade 
  him that the appellant's assertion of ownership of the briefcase was true or 
  that, in light of it, the appellant was an innocent and uninvolved third party.</p>
<p>
  [40] Dyett was not obliged to simply accept the appellant's assertions of ownership 
  of the briefcase and of an innocent explanation for its presence in the stolen 
  van, and to terminate the search of the briefcase on the basis of those assertions. 
  That proposition, urged by the appellant, defies common sense and, if accepted, 
  would render the search incident to arrest power meaningless in circumstances 
  where, but for the ownership claim, it is being lawfully exercised for the purpose 
  of discovering or preserving evidence relating to a crime.</p>
<p>
  [41] The appellant argues that the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in Law, supra, supports his contention that the power of search incident to 
  arrest did not extend to a briefcase which Dyett knew belonged to the appellant. 
  In that case, Bastarache J. stated at paras. 19 and 25: </p>
<p class="indent"> The existence of a residual privacy interest does not undermine 
  the police's obligation to investigate the theft of a stolen item, or to carry 
  out whatever law enforcement responsibility is reasonably associated with its 
  taking. Any expectation of privacy must be reasonable. Thus, an unat-tended 
  suitcase may have to be inspected for explosives, a stray wallet for identification, 
  or a deserted vehicle for evidence of theft. More extensive investigation may 
  be re-quired to determine the motive of the theft, or to identify the perpetrator. 
  However, where the police cannot reasonably conclude the property has been abandoned 
  by its owner, they are limited in their investigation by the privacy interest 
  of the owner as protected by s. 8 of the Charter.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">It is clear that the police are "lawfully positioned" in such 
  cases inasmuch as their common law and statutory duties include the protection 
  of property. However, the police's obligation to search a stolen car is not 
  without its limits. As the intervener acknowledges, "a police officer might 
  be justified in fully inspecting the driver and passenger compartment of a stolen 
  car during the course of an investigation of the theft, but might be precluded, 
  absent a warrant, from searching through computer files contained in a laptop 
  computer locked in the car's trunk"; see also, R. v. Spinelli (1995), 101 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 385 (B.C.C.A.), per Southin J.A., at para. 36.</p>
<p>
  [42] I conclude that Law does not assist the appellant in the manner asserted 
  by him, for several reasons. First, Law expressly confirms that the obligation 
  of the police to investigate the theft of stolen property, including a stolen 
  motor vehicle, is not displaced by the privacy interests which may attach to 
  the property. To the contrary, the search of unattended property was recognized 
  as potentially necessary to achieve legitimate law enforcement aims.</p>
<p>
  [43] Second, in my view, there is a significant distinction between the warrantless 
  search of a laptop computer locked in a stolen car's trunk, as referenced in 
  the quoted passage from Law, and the warrantless search of an unlocked briefcase 
  in an unlocked stolen vehicle. A computer can be a repository for an almost 
  unlimited universe of information. As Crown counsel points out, Parliament has 
  treated computers as stand-alone search locations warranting specific rules. 
  See Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, ss. 487(2.1) and (2.2). </p>
<p>
  [44] Third, even in the case of the search of a laptop computer, the need for 
  a warrant was described in Law as a possibility rather than as a pre-condition 
  to a lawful search.</p>
<p>
  [45] As well, in the quoted comments from Law, the Supreme Court expressly endorsed 
  the observations of Southin J.A. in Spinelli, supra, to which I have previously 
  referred. In Spinelli, Southin J.A. suggested that the search of the entire 
  contents of a stolen car may be permissible to search for evidence that might 
  lead to the apprehension of the perpetrator of the theft. </p>
<p>
  [46] Finally, Law is distinguishable from the case at bar in one additional, 
  and controlling, respect. In Law, the purpose of the challenged warrantless 
  search of the safe was not connected to the investigation of the theft of the 
  safe. It was undertaken for the unrelated purpose of searching for possible 
  evidence concerning tax evasion. In my view, the suggestion in Law that a warrant 
  may be required to search items of property found in a stolen motor vehicle 
  flows from the purpose for which the search is under-taken. Where that purpose 
  is unrelated to the investigation of the theft of the vehicle, a warrantless 
  search may not be justified.</p>
<p>
  [47] That is not this case. Here, on each occasion that Dyett opened the briefcase, 
  he undertook his search of its contents for the purpose of discovering evidence 
  relating to the crimes for which Jebo had been arrested. The searches were grounded 
  in Jebo's arrest and were carried out in a vehicle known to have been stolen.</p>
<p>
  [48] In these circumstances, I conclude that the requirements for a valid search 
  of the appellant's briefcase under the search incident to arrest power were 
  met. The search of the contents of the briefcase was not unlawful or unreasonable 
  and, hence, the evidence obtained from that search was admissible. Accordingly, 
  it is unnecessary to address the arguments of the parties regarding s. 24(2) 
  of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  (2) The Rejection of Jebo's Evidence and the </p>
<p>
  Reasonableness of the Verdicts</p>
<p>
  [49] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in rejecting Jebo's evidence 
  and that this error led to unreasonable verdicts. In my view, this ground of 
  appeal is unsustainable.</p>
<p>
  [50] The trial judge concluded that Jebo's testimony was "quite unbelievable" 
  and that Jebo is "a thoroughly dishonest person". He based those conclusions 
  on: (i) numerous internal inconsistencies and contradictions in Jebo's evidence, 
  some of which the trial judge detailed in his reasons; (ii) the fact that it 
  was not until almost fifteen months following the appellant's arrest and after 
  the preliminary inquiry in his own case, that Jebo alleged for the first time 
  that he found the large sealed envelope in the Plymouth van and placed it in 
  the appellant's briefcase; (iii) the fact that at the time of his testimony 
  at the appellant's trial, Jebo not only had been convicted of the charges against 
  him concerning possession of the stolen Yukon truck and the Plymouth van, but 
  had also been convicted of an unrelated fraud; and (iv) the fact that Jebo's 
  claim that he and members of his family were threatened with harm by the vendor 
  of the stolen motor vehicles was asserted, for the first time, only when Jebo 
  was pressed on cross-examination for an explanation as to what he did when he 
  learned that the vehicles were stolen.</p>
<p>
  [51] These factors all bore directly on Jebo's credibility and the reliability 
  of his testimony. Based on them, it was clearly open to the trial judge to reject 
  Jebo's evidence as not worthy of belief. Once his testimony concerning the large 
  sealed envelope, which contained significant incriminating evidence against 
  the appellant, was rejected, the issue was how the envelope had come to be in 
  the appellant's briefcase. This was important because the envelope contained 
  most, although not all, of the inculpatory documentary evidence against the 
  appellant. The trial judge concluded: "[I]t simply overwhelms the law of 
  probability, even the laws of coincidence, that someone unknown opened the vehicle 
  and deliberately placed [the envelope] inside the accused's briefcase. I do 
  not accept that that could have happened." Thus, as he was entitled to 
  do, the trial judge rejected the appellant's assertion that he knew nothing 
  about the envelope or its contents and how it came to be in his briefcase.</p>
<p>
  [52] Once the trial judge rejected the appellant's testimony regarding the envelope, 
  it remained for the trial judge to determine if he was left in reasonable doubt 
  by the appellant's evidence. If he was not, the trial judge was next required 
  to consider whether, on the basis of the evidence which he did accept, he was 
  convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence of the appellant's guilt: 
  R. v. W.(D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 at para. 27. In my view, the trial judge properly 
  discharged these requirements of W.(D.), for the following reasons.</p>
<p>
  [53] First, implicit in the trial judge's finding that the appellant's testimony 
  concerning the large sealed envelope could not be believed, is the conclusion 
  that he was not left in reasonable doubt by the appellant's evidence. This was 
  a straightforward trial. The defence called only two witnesses. Once Jebo's 
  evidence was rejected as unbelievable, the defence case consisted only of the 
  appellant's testimony and the evidence which emerged on cross-examination of 
  the Crown's two witnesses. The reasons of the trial judge make it abundantly 
  clear that the defence case did not leave him in a state of reasonable doubt 
  concerning the appellant's guilt.</p>
<p>
  [54] Second, the trial judge addressed the third and final branch of the W.(D.) 
  test in the following terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am forced once again to look at the obvious inference that [the large sealed 
  envelope] was in the briefcase because the accused put it there, together with 
  the other contents that he admits were also found in it. Linking the counterfeit 
  materials [in the large envelope] with the other contents leads irresistibly 
  to the inference that the accused knew the Plymouth and the GMC Yukon were stolen.</p>
<p>
  [55] Counsel for the appellant in this proceeding properly conceded during oral 
  argument that if the trial judge's conclusion that the appellant placed the 
  large sealed envelope in the briefcase is supportable, then the Crown's case 
  against the appellant was overwhelming. It was open to the trial judge to infer 
  from the whole of the circumstances that the appellant placed the large envelope 
  in the briefcase and that he knew that the Plymouth van was stolen. Based on 
  the evidence concerning the contents of that envelope and of the remainder of 
  the appellant's briefcase, there was ample evidence upon which a properly instructed 
  jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have convicted the appellant: R. v. 
  Yebes, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168 at para. 23 and R. v. Biniaris, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381 
  at para. 36. Accordingly, the verdicts are not unreasonable.</p>
<p>
  (3) Constructive Possession</p>
<p>
  [56] The trial judge concluded that the appellant had knowledge and sufficient 
  joint control to place him in constructive possession of the Yukon truck and 
  the Plymouth van. I do not believe that the trial judge erred in reaching that 
  conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [57] Jebo and the appellant were both charged with possession of the stolen 
  Yukon truck and the Plymouth van. The Crown's case against Jebo was based on 
  actual possession of the vehicles, while its case against the appellant depended 
  on proof of constructive possession. Jebo pleaded guilty to the charges against 
  him, thereby admitting his actual possession of the vehicles. Consequently, 
  in its case against the appellant, the Crown was obliged to demonstrate that 
  the appellant knew that the vehicles were stolen and that he had some element 
  of control over them.</p>
<p>
  [58] In connection with this ground of appeal, the appellant does not challenge 
  the trial judge's finding that the appellant knew that the Yukon truck and the 
  Plymouth van were stolen. Rather, he argues that control is a constituent and 
  essential element of constructive possession, that the Crown was obliged and 
  failed to prove that the appellant intended to exercise control over the two 
  vehicles, and that there was no evidence that the appellant had the requisite 
  intent and control in this case. I disagree.</p>
<p>
  [59] Section 4(3)(b) of the Criminal Code provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> 4(3) For the purposes of this Act</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) where one of two or more persons, with the knowledge and 
  consent of the rest, has anything in his custody or possession, it shall be 
  deemed to be in the custody and possession of each and all of them. </p>
<p>
  [60] The trial judge recognized that constructive possession was the gravamen 
  of the charges against the appellant. He also expressly referenced the applicable 
  legal principles governing proof by the Crown of possession and constructive 
  possession, stating: "[W]here two or more persons are charged with possession 
  of the same article&#133;at least one of the two or more persons must be in 
  actual possession&#133;and the others will be in joint possession if they know 
  what the object is and have some element of control over the disposition of 
  the object" [emphasis added]. As the Crown argues, this is an accurate 
  statement of the law concerning constructive possession: see R. v. Terrence, 
  [1983] 1 S.C.R. 357.</p>
<p>
  [61] As this court held in R. v. Savory (1996), 94 O.A.C. 318 at para. 7, control 
  does not require that an accused in fact exercise control over the object in 
  question. Rather, control in this context means power or authority over the 
  object in question. </p>
<p>
  [62] In connection with the Yukon truck, the evidence established that Jebo 
  sold a Yukon truck to the appellant who then arranged for the resale of the 
  vehicle to a purch-aser in Amsterdam. At the appellant's request, Jebo made 
  arrangements to ship that Yukon truck to Holland. The second Yukon vehicle, 
  discovered at the Fenmar Drive location, was stolen and was in Jebo's actual 
  possession. When he searched the appellant's briefcase, Dyett discovered counterfeit 
  VIN materials matching the VIN on the dashboard of the second Yukon truck at 
  the Fenmar Drive premises and the legitimate VIN on the Yukon truck scheduled 
  for exportation. The appellant's constructive possession of the stolen Yukon 
  truck was thus clearly established.</p>
<p>
  [63] In connection with the Plymouth van, the appellant admitted having test-driven 
  the van about one hour before his arrest. His briefcase was found in the van. 
  Dyett found the appellant's passport and driver's licence in the briefcase, 
  together with numerous documents that implicated the appellant in a joint enterprise 
  with Jebo. The latter documents, as I have earlier outlined, included: counterfeit 
  stickers and labels used to renumber stolen vehicles, a reference letter for 
  one of Jebo's employees, a telephone bill for an account in Jebo's name, shipping 
  documents and dock receipts concerning vehicles shipped to Europe by Jebo's 
  company, and a retail sales tax receipt for Jebo's used car business. Moreover, 
  the counterfeit VIN plate for the Yukon truck that was discovered in the large 
  envelope in the appellant's briefcase was registered in the name of Jebo's company. 
  This evidence clearly established a joint enterprise and common purpose between 
  the appellant and Jebo. By itself, this was sufficient to warrant a finding 
  of constructive possession. In addition, Crown counsel submits that the evidence 
  of an inter-relationship between Jebo and the appellant was sufficiently powerful 
  that the appellant's culpability might well have been based on party liability 
  under s. 21 of the Criminal Code. I agree.</p>
<p>
  (4) Alleged Misapprehension of Evidence</p>
<p>
  [64] Finally, the appellant asserts that the trial judge misapprehended aspects 
  of the evidence of Jebo and of Dyett and failed to consider other evidence. 
  This argument may be dealt with summarily, for three reasons. </p>
<p>
  [65] First, I am not persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence 
  of Jebo. He simply rejected it, as he was entitled to do.</p>
<p>
  [66] Second, although the Crown concedes that the trial judge misunderstood 
  one aspect of Dyett's evidence by indicating in his reasons that the contents 
  of the appellant's briefcase contained a counterfeit VIN plate for the Plymouth 
  van as well as for the Yukon truck, I conclude that this misstatement was inconsequential. 
  Once the evidence concerning the contents of the appellant's briefcase was properly 
  admitted, as in my view it was, the Crown's case against the appellant was formidable. 
  As I have mentioned, the appellant's counsel concedes as much.</p>
<p>
  [67] Third, the appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to consider 
  the significance of a bill of sale and other documents found in the appellant's 
  briefcase does not persuade me that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence 
  before him. The trial judge was not required to detail in his reasons all of 
  the evidence that he considered. His failure to expressly mention a particular 
  item of physical or other evidence does not mean that he failed to consider 
  it. In any event, in the context of all of the incriminating documents found 
  in the appellant's briefcase, the bill of sale and the other documents relied 
  upon by the appellant did not diminish the strength of the evidence of a joint 
  enter-prise between Jebo and the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [68] Accordingly, for the reasons given, I would dismiss the appellant's appeal 
  from his convictions.</p>
<p>
  III. SENTENCE APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [69] Two issues arise on the appellant's appeal against sentence, namely, whether 
  the trial judge erred: (i) in making a restitution order in the circumstances 
  of this case; and (ii) in failing to impose a conditional sentence.</p>
<p>
  (1) Restitution Order</p>
<p>
  [70] As relevant to this appeal, s. 738(1)(a) of the Criminal Code provides 
  that a court imposing sentence may order the offender to make restitution to 
  another person: "in the case of damage to, or the loss or destruction of, 
  the property of any person as a result of the commission of the offence&#133;by 
  paying to the person an amount not exceeding the replacement value of the property 
  as of the date the order is imposed, less the value of any part of the property 
  that is returned to that person as of the date it is returned, where the amount 
  is readily ascertainable".</p>
<p>
  [71] The appellant submits that the restitution order was improper for three 
  reasons. First, the actual loss allegedly suffered by the two insurance companies 
  was not easily determinable and, on the evidence adduced by the Crown, could 
  not be calculated as required. Second, the trial judge failed to consider, and 
  the Crown failed to establish, the appellant's ability to make restitution during 
  the period of his probation. Third, the loss of the two insurance companies 
  was not occasioned by reason of the appellant's possession of the stolen motor 
  vehicles but, rather, as a result of the theft of the motor vehicles, an offence 
  in respect of which the appellant was not charged or convicted.</p>
<p>
  [72] The factors and objectives relevant to the imposition of a restitution 
  order are well-established: R. v. Devgan (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.) and 
  R. v. Biegus (1999), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 245 (Ont. C.A.). A restitution order is 
  a discretionary order that must be made with restraint and caution. In addition, 
  as stated by the court in Devgan at p. 168: "A compensation order should 
  not be granted when it would require the criminal court to interpret written 
  documents to determine the amount of money sought through the order. The loss 
  should be capable of ready calculation." </p>
<p>
  [73] In this case, the appellant challenges the sufficiency of the proof adduced 
  by the Crown of the loss with respect to which restitution was sought. The evidence 
  of loss relied upon by the Crown consisted of: (i) a memorandum dated November 
  23, 2000 to Dyett from one insurance company indicating that it had paid out 
  a total of approximately $56,000 and recovered salvage in the sum of $23,931.25 
  in relation to the Yukon truck; and (ii) a letter to Dyett from the second insurance 
  company indicating that it had paid its insured the amount of $34,267.50 for 
  "damages" concerning the theft of the Plymouth van and had recovered 
  salvage in the sum of $13,555, resulting in a total amount "owed" 
  to the insurance company in the sum of $20,712.50.</p>
<p>
  [74] No evidence was led by the Crown providing a breakdown of the monies paid 
  out by the insurance companies or demonstrating that the payouts related only 
  to the loss of the stolen vehicles or their contents. In addition, the Crown 
  did not tender the applicable insurance policies as evidence at the sentencing 
  hearing or call any representative of the insurance companies to testify regarding 
  the claimed losses.</p>
<p>
  [75] As observed by this court in R. v. Hirnschall, [2003] O.J. No. 2296 at 
  para. 33, under s. 738(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, a restitution order is limited 
  to "an amount not exceeding the replacement value of the property". 
  On the evidence led by the Crown in the case at bar, the replacement value of 
  the two stolen motor vehicles and the amounts paid by the insurers solely with 
  respect to the loss of property were not established and were not capable of 
  ready calculation. Consequently, in my view, sufficient proof of loss was not 
  offered by the Crown to meet the requirements of s. 738(1)(a) of the Code. </p>
<p>
  [76] Accordingly, the restitution order cannot stand. As I would allow the sentence 
  appeal relating to the restitution order on this basis, it is unnecessary to 
  address the appellant's other grounds of attack on the restitution order.</p>
<p>
  (2) Conditional Sentence</p>
<p>
  [77] The appellant asserts that the trial judge's failure to impose a conditional 
  sentence offends the principle of parity in sentencing given that Jebo received 
  a conditional sentence of one year to be served in the community followed by 
  probation for the same offences. He also argues that the trial judge erred in 
  commenting in his reasons for sentence that a conditional sentence would deprive 
  the appellant of the ability to earn a living and in alluding to the fact that 
  the appellant did not inform his family of his convictions. </p>
<p>
  [78] The trial judge considered the appropriateness of a conditional sentence 
  and correctly concluded that the appellant fit within the category of persons 
  in respect of whom a conditional sentence might legally be imposed. He declined 
  to impose a conditional sentence, however, on the grounds that the offences 
  of which the appellant was convicted were serious and because, in the trial 
  judge's view, the service of a conditional sentence within the community in 
  this case would not carry the same stigma as it would in other cases as evidenced 
  by the fact that the appellant's convictions were unknown both to his community 
  and to his family. The trial judge further stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]here are two main objects that this court should seek to accomplish by the 
  sentence it imposes on you. The first is some recognition by you and by the 
  public that you know and [it] knows&#133;that you have been convicted of a serious 
  offence, and the second is to mitigate as much as possible the effect of your 
  crime on the community. &#133;</p>
<p>
  [79] Absent error in principle, appellate courts will not lightly interfere 
  with the exercise of discretion by a trial judge in imposing sentence. I am 
  not persuaded that the trial judge erred in this case in declining to impose 
  a conditional sentence. As he observed, the offences of which the appellant 
  was convicted are serious. The appellant was an active participant in a sophisticated 
  and organized joint enterprise designed to effect the theft, and the exportation 
  from Canada for profit, of valuable motor vehicles. The appellant was tried, 
  convicted and sentenced before Jebo was sentenced. Unlike Jebo, who pleaded 
  guilty to the charges against him, the appellant was not entitled to mitigation 
  of his sentence based on a guilty plea. In addition, the reasons for sentence 
  of the sentencing judge in Jebo's case indicate that but for the sentence imposed 
  on the appellant, which the sentencing judge in Jebo's case regarded as lenient, 
  and the principle of parity in sentencing, Jebo would have been sentenced to 
  a significant period of imprisonment. Accordingly, for these reasons, I would 
  not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  IV. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [80] For the reasons given, I would dismiss the appellant's conviction appeal. 
  I would allow his appeal against sentence, in part, by setting aside the restitution 
  order, and would dismiss the balance of his sentence appeal.</p>
