<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: April 5, 2004</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant appeals against his conviction on the basis that the trial 
  judge misapprehended the evidence at the trial in three domains - (1) the forensic 
  evidence relating to the complainant's injuries; (2) the evidence relating to 
  the appellant's after the fact conduct; and (3) the evidence with respect to 
  the appellant's alleged prior employment at the complainant's convenience store.</p>
<p>
  [2] In spite of Ms. Maunder's able submissions, we do not think that the trial 
  judge misapprehended the evidence in any of these domains. </p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge's analysis of the circumstances giving rise to, and the 
  nature of, the complainant's injuries was comprehensive and balanced. In particular, 
  he was entitled to rely on Dr. Walkovich's testimony about the nature and the 
  extent of the complainant's injuries.</p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge's interpretation of the evidence of Mr. Hartounian - namely, 
  that the appellant admitted to him his involvement in the events at the store 
  (although he tried to minimize it by saying that "a friend" actually 
  did it) - is a supportable interpretation, even though in cross?examination 
  Mr. Hartounian agreed with the suggestion that the appellant might have used 
  the wording "the other guy".</p>
<p>
  [5] There was a good deal of evidence supporting the Crown's position that the 
  appellant had never worked at the convenience store. The trial judge was entitled 
  to accept that evidence and reject the defence evidence on this issue. This 
  is what he did, with reasons.</p>
<p>
  [6] Both the appellant and the Crown challenge the sentence imposed by the trial 
  judge. We see no merit in their duelling submissions. The sentence imposed by 
  the trial judge was an appropriate one.</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant's appeal is dismissed. The Crown's cross?appeal is dismissed.</p>
