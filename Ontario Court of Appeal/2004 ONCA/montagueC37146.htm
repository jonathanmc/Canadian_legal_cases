<p>On appeal from the judgment and cost of Justice Sandra Chapnik of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated October 19, 2001.</p>
<p>
  GOUDGE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant Yvonne Montague was terminated from her employment with the 
  respondent, Bank of Nova Scotia, on July 24, 1991. She sued for wrongful dismissal. 
  Prior to trial, the Bank admitted that it did not have cause to terminate Mrs. 
  Montague's employment. On October 19, 2001, Chapnik J. awarded the appellant 
  damages equivalent to sixteen months' notice together with pre-judgment 
  interest and costs fixed at $5,000.</p>
<p>
  [2] Mrs. Montague appeals, arguing that the trial judge erred in awarding too 
  little notice and in dismissing her claim for aggravated and punitive damages.</p>
<p>
  [3] The Bank cross-appeals, arguing that the notice period is too long and that 
  the trial judge erred in increasing it after she had been advised of the Bank's 
  offer to settle pursuant to Rule 49.</p>
<p>
  [4] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [5] Mrs. Montague was employed by the Bank as a data entry operator for approximately 
  fifteen and one-half years, from January 26, 1976 to July 24, 1991. When she 
  was terminated, she was earning an annual salary of $24,750.00, plus a shift 
  bonus valued at $1,254.50 per year. Her employee benefits were valued at $2,600.45 
  per year.</p>
<p>
  [6] On August 13, 1990, Mrs. Montague slipped and fell at work, injuring her 
  right shoulder. As a result she was away from work until January 2, 1991, when 
  she returned to a modified work schedule, as recommended by her doctors.</p>
<p>
  [7] On February 18, 1991, Mrs. Montague again fell at work and injured her lower 
  back. Again she was off work, this time until April 15, 1991, again returning 
  to a modified work schedule. However, she was unable to sustain this schedule, 
  and on April 30, 1991 she stopped working altogether. </p>
<p>
  [8] Mrs. Montague's claim for long-term disability was denied by the administrator 
  of the Bank's long-term disability plan because it was inadequately supported 
  by the available medical information. On July 8, 1991, the Bank wrote to Mrs. 
  Montague to advise that because of this decision, she was expected to return 
  to her regular work duties on her usual shift no later than July 22, 1991, failing 
  which she would be treated as having abandoned her employment. The letter also 
  indicated that she could appeal the rejection of her long-term disability claim 
  if she provided further medical documentation. At that time, the Bank had a 
  number of medical reports about Mrs. Montague, both from her own doctors and 
  from doctors she had seen at the Bank's request. There was clearly some 
  medical controversy over whether she was able to do the keypunch work required 
  by her regular job.</p>
<p>
  [9] On the day she received the Bank's letter of July 8, 1991, Mrs. Montague 
  delivered a written reply advising that she had made appointments with two other 
  physicians to whom she had been referred by her family doctor. One appointment 
  was scheduled for July 12, 1991 and the other, with an internal medicine specialist, 
  for July 23, 1991. Mrs. Montague indicated that reports from these two doctors 
  would be submitted to the Bank.</p>
<p>
  [10] Despite this, on July 24 1991, the day after her appointment with the specialist, 
  the Bank wrote to Mrs. Montague terminating her employment. The letter did not 
  acknowledge the fact of the two recent medical consultations. Nor did the Bank 
  make any inquiries of Mrs. Montague about what she had learned or when the resulting 
  medical reports might be expected. It simply fired her.</p>
<p>
  [11] Mrs. Montague commenced an action against the Bank, seeking damages for 
  her injuries under the Occupiers' Liability Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.2 and 
  damages for wrongful dismissal. She succeeded in the former claim, but the latter 
  claim was dismissed as res judicata because of a complaint she had lodged with 
  the Canadian Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>
  [12] Mrs. Montague appealed, and this court set aside the dismissal of her wrongful 
  dismissal claim. It then proceeded to the trial from which the present appeal 
  is taken.</p>
<p>
  [13] At the conclusion of four days of evidence, the trial judge made the following 
  findings.</p>
<p>
  [14] First, she concluded that this case engaged the considerations set out 
  in Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd., [1997] 3 S.C.R. 701, thus increasing 
  the period of reasonable notice to which Mrs. Montague was entitled on termination. 
  The trial judge put it this way: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In all of the circumstances, I have no difficulty whatsoever in finding that 
  the bank acted precipitously and in bad faith; it did not treat the plaintiff 
  fairly in the manner of her dismissal. Ms. Montague at no time took any action 
  which suggested abandonment of her employment. On the contrary, she was in continuous 
  contact with both the nurse, Dorothy Harris, and Linda Jackson, Personnel Manager, 
  as confirmed by Rena Benson, about her disability, which she claimed needed 
  to be accommodated. Her summary dismissal by letter in view of the pending medical 
  visits to the knowledge of the defendant was unreasonable, and the position 
  taken that she had abandoned her job was, in the circumstances, quite preposterous.</p>
<p>
  [15] Second, the trial judge found that it would not be reasonable to place 
  a duty on the appellant to mitigate her damages during the notice period, given 
  her medical condition at that time. </p>
<p>
  [16] Third, the trial judge concluded that the respondent's conduct towards 
  the appellant did not constitute an independent actionable wrong and was not 
  so egregious as to offend the court's sense of decency. Hence she dismissed 
  the claims for both aggravated and punitive damages.</p>
<p>
  [17] Finally, the trial judge fixed the period of reasonable notice in these 
  words: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the circumstances, I award her damages at the high end of the scale, in effect 
  raising the notice period pursuant to the Wallace decision by finding the period 
  of reasonable notice to be 12 months.</p>
<p class="indent"> That's my decision.</p>
<p>
  [18] Immediately thereafter this exchange occurred between counsel for the respondent 
  and the trial judge: </p>
<p class="indent">
  MR. LEONARD: Perhaps I might go first, Your Honour. There was an offer to settle. 
  I have to bring it to your attention, and I apologize for this, Your Honour, 
  I only brought one set of that. I'm happy to hand it up. You'll 
  see that you've awarded twelve months. By my calculation that award would 
  be an award of $28,604.95, and you'll see that offer is for $30,500, which 
  is more than that, plus prejudgment interest, plus party and party costs to 
  the date of that offer. So, my submission to you simply is that we've 
  met the requirements of Rule 49. I'm completely in Your Honour's 
  hands, obviously, and your discretion not to apply Rule 49 in these circumstances 
  if you are so inclined.</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: Did I say twelve months including the increase because 
  of the Wallace decision?</p>
<p class="indent"> MR. LEONARD: You did. Is that not what you intended?</p>
<p class="indent"> THE COURT: No. I meant at least another month.</p>
<p>
  [19] Counsel then advised the trial judge that even with a thirteen month notice 
  period, his offer triggered the effect of Rule 49, and he asked for partial 
  indemnity costs from the date of the offer in the amount of $5,000.</p>
<p>
  [20] The trial judge concluded the day with this: </p>
<p class="indent">
  THE COURT: The law is the law; it's not always the fairest thing, but 
  in light of the offer, I don't think I really have a choice. I think I 
  must order the thirteen months reasonable notice and $5,000 costs to the defendant. 
  I would hope that in the long run they are not required.</p>
<p>
  [21] Four days later, the judgment not having been entered in the court records, 
  the trial judge summoned the parties back to court. She opened the court as 
  follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  THE COURT: You will recall, Mrs. Montague and Mr. Leonard, that at the end of 
  my judgment on Friday, I awarded damages to Mrs. Montague at the high end of 
  the notice scale which I deemed to be eight to twelve months and fixed the period 
  of reasonable notice, the appropriate period at twelve months. I said that would 
  in effect increase the notice period pursuant to the Wallace decision. Then 
  in the course of discussion, I increased the entire notice period to thirteen 
  months.</p>
<p class="indent"> On further reflection, I think that I should have dealt with 
  the period of reasonable notice separately from the Wallace factors. And, in 
  my view, the thirteen months is a bit low. To properly reflect my findings regarding 
  the Wallace factor, that is, the improper manner of dismissal, the knowledge 
  of its probable effect on the plaintiff, the withholding of the letters and 
  the whole picture from Mr. Seymour, and the actual effect of the dismissal on 
  the plaintiff, I should have added instead of one month four months to the period 
  of reasonable notice. The twelve month period of reasonable notice was decided 
  according to the factors listed in the Bardal vs. Global and Mail case, taking 
  into account the plaintiff's age at the time, her qualifications, her 
  disability, and so on. So that the appropriate notice period should be twelve 
  months plus four months or sixteen months in all.</p>
<p class="indent"> Now, I know this will change the cost factor,
  as well.</p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge then invited submissions on costs, given the change in 
  the period of reasonable notice. Counsel for the respondent conceded that he 
  was no longer entitled to the benefit of Rule 49 but urged that there should 
  be no costs against the Bank since Mrs. Montague had represented herself from 
  shortly before the trial. The appellant asked for costs in the amount of $5,000 
  because that was what counsel for the Bank had sought four days earlier, and 
  because she had in fact paid a lawyer that amount to do the work leading up 
  to the trial.</p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge concluded the proceedings by awarding the appellant costs 
  on a party and party basis throughout, fixed at $5,000.</p>
<p>
  THE APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant's primary submission is that the trial judge erred 
  in concluding that the period of reasonable notice required in this case was 
  limited to sixteen months. As Laskin J.A. said in Minott v. O'Shanter 
  Development Co. (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.), this submission must be judged 
  against the standard of appellate review of wrongful dismissal awards. He described 
  it this way at p. 343-344: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Determining the period of reasonable notice is an art not a science. In each 
  case trial judges must weigh and balance a catalogue of relevant factors. No 
  two cases are identical; and, ordinarily, there is no one "right" 
  figure for reasonable notice. Instead, most cases yield a range of reasonableness. 
  Therefore, a trial judge's determination of the period of reasonable notice 
  is entitled to deference from an appellate court. An appeal court is not justified 
  in interfering unless the figure arrived at by the trial judge is outside an 
  acceptable range or unless, in arriving at the figure, the trial judge erred 
  in principle or made an unreasonable finding of fact. &#8230; If the trial judge 
  erred in principle, an appellate court may substitute its own figure. But it 
  should do so sparingly if the trial judge's award is within an acceptable 
  range despite the error in principle.</p>
<p>
  [25] The trial judge here did not err in principle in fixing the period of reasonable 
  notice. She was alive to and considered the relevant factors as set out in cases 
  like Bardal v. The Globe and Mail Ltd. (1960), 24 D.L.R. (2d) 140 (Ont. H.C.). 
  She also discussed and applied the principle set out in Wallace. Nor can it 
  be said that the sixteen months is below an acceptable range of notice and must 
  therefore be increased. On the contrary, if anything, this would be on the generous 
  side in these circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [26] Thus the appellant's first argument must fail.</p>
<p>
  [27] Second, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in dismissing her 
  claim for aggravated and punitive damages. I do not agree. There was ample evidence 
  to support the conclusion of the trial judge that there was no malice or vindictiveness 
  by the Bank or its officials here. In addition, the evidence does not sustain 
  the conclusion that the Bank's conduct constitutes a separately actionable 
  wrong. Hence punitive damages were properly denied. Moreover, the absence of 
  any separately actionable wrong puts an end to any entitlement to aggravated 
  damages.</p>
<p>
  [28] In the result the appellant's second argument must also fail and 
  the appeal must therefore be dismissed.</p>
<p>THE CROSS-APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [29] The respondent's first submission is that the trial judge erred in 
  extending the period of reasonable notice using the considerations described 
  in Wallace. </p>
<p>
  [30] I disagree. The trial judge focused on the timing of the termination and 
  the characterization made by the respondent of the appellant's failure 
  to report to work on July 22, 2001. There was ample evidence for her to conclude 
  that the respondent fired the appellant precipitously, knowing of the pending 
  medical visits but making no effort to find out what information they had yielded 
  or when the resulting reports might be available. Moreover, the respondent treated 
  the appellant as having abandoned her position, knowing that she had done nothing 
  to suggest that. It was reasonable for the trial judge to assess this conduct 
  as being unreasonable and in bad faith. As a result, Wallace was properly applied.</p>
<p>
  [31] Where mitigation or deduction for other benefits is not appropriate, it 
  is no doubt preferable to take a holistic approach to fixing reasonable notice, 
  and to do so on the basis of all relevant factors, including those referred 
  to in Wallace, rather than to make a discrete addition to the notice period 
  to reflect the manner of dismissal. See Noseworthy v. Riverside Pontiac Buick 
  Ltd. (1998), 168 D.L.R. (4th 629 (Ont. C.A.). Nonetheless, the end result of 
  sixteen months does not constitute error in this case. It is within a range 
  of reasonableness given all the circumstances. The cross-appellant's first 
  argument must therefore fail.</p>
<p>
  [32] The Bank's second argument on its cross-appeal is that the trial 
  judge erred in changing her judgment (namely her determination of the reasonable 
  notice period) on two occasions after having reviewed the Bank's offer 
  to settle pursuant to Rule 49.</p>
<p>
  [33] The Bank argues that Rule 49.06(2) and (3) prohibits the trial judge from 
  doing this. Rule 49.06 reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  DISCLOSURE OF OFFER TO COURT</p>
<p class="indent"> (1) No statement of the fact that an offer to settle has been 
  made shall be contained in any pleading.</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) Where an offer to settle is not accepted, no communication 
  respecting the offer shall be made to the court at the hearing of the proceeding 
  until all questions of liability and the relief to be granted, other than costs, 
  have been determined.</p>
<p class="indent"> (3) An offer to settle shall not be filed until all questions 
  of liability and the relief to be granted in the proceeding, other than costs, 
  have been determined.</p>
<p>
  [34] I cannot agree that the rule prohibits the trial judge from changing her 
  order. There can be no doubt that until a judgment is formally entered in the 
  court record, the judge has a very broad discretion to change it. In Holmes 
  Foundry Ltd. v. Village of Point Edward; Caposite Insulations Ltd. v. Village 
  of Point Edward (1963), 2 O.R. 404 (C.A.), Laidlaw J.A. put it this way at 407: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is well settled in law that an order can always be withdrawn, altered or 
  modified by a Judge either on his own initiative or on the application of a 
  party until such time as the order has been drawn up, passed and entered. I 
  refer to Re Harrison's Share under a Settlement, Harrison v. Harrison, 
  [1955] 1 Ch. 260 at p. 275, [1955] 1 All E.R. 185.</p>
<p>
  [35] Rule 49.06 is not a prohibition directed at the court. Rather, the rule 
  targets those who might communicate information about an unaccepted offer to 
  the court before liability and consequential relief are determined. It prevents 
  communications to the judge designed to improperly affect the course of justice.</p>
<p>
  [36] The terms of the rule do not purport to limit the broad judicial power 
  to alter a judgment beforeit is entered. Very clear language would be required 
  to curtail a judicial discretion having such deep historical roots. Nor is there 
  any reason to stretch the rule to achieve this result, since this judicial discretion 
  allows a judge to change his or her judgment precisely to better serve the ends 
  of justice. Rule 49.06 does not prohibit what the trial judge did here.</p>
<p>
  [37] The Bank also argues that the changes made by the trial judge constitute 
  reversible error because the only reason she made the changes was to avoid the 
  cost consequences of Rule 49 for Mrs. Montague.</p>
<p>
  [38] In my view the record does not sustain the conclusion that the changes 
  were made to avoid the cost consequences of Rule 49. The trial judge candidly 
  acknowledged that her first decision (twelve months) was not what she intended 
  and that she had meant at least thirteen months. Then, when she made the second 
  change four days later (to sixteen months), she explained why in her view the 
  Wallace factors warranted an additional four months, not just an additional 
  one month. Had the trial judge simply wished to alleviate the consequences of 
  Rule 49 for Mrs. Montague, she could have done so by using the residual discretion 
  given to her by the rule itself. There was no need to change her judgment. The 
  timing of events in this case was clearly unfortunate, as the trial judge recognized. 
  However, this is no reason not to take the trial judge's conclusions at 
  face value. </p>
<p>
  [39] Even if I had come to the opposite conclusion, I would not have interfered 
  with the trial judge's final judgment. I say this because even if the 
  trial judge had erred in principle in the exercise of her discretion, her final 
  assessment that sixteen months constitutes reasonable notice in this case is, 
  in my view, a reasonable conclusion. Hence no appellate intervention is warranted. 
  See Minott, supra at 24. Given the factors relevant to the assessment of reasonable 
  notice, including the manner of the appellant's termination, sixteen months, 
  although perhaps generous, is within a range of reasonableness in the circumstances 
  and therefore it is a conclusion entitled to deference in this court.</p>
<p>
  [40] I conclude with this. While this is not such a case, I have no doubt that 
  in some cases the very wide discretion a judge has to change his or her judgment 
  before it is entered could be abused if it were exercised for an improper purpose. 
  Any change to a judgment once given, no matter how soundly based, runs the risk 
  of evoking suspicions of abuse on the part of those adversely affected. It is 
  at the least disquieting, and to that extent can put a cloud over the administration 
  of justice. A judge exercising this discretion bears a significant onus to explain 
  the change. Giving clear reasons for decision is always a profoundly important 
  part of judging. See R. v. Sheppard, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869. It is never more important 
  than in this circumstance.</p>
<p>
  [41] The appeal and cross-appeal must both be dismissed. In the circumstances 
  there should be no costs to either party.</p>
