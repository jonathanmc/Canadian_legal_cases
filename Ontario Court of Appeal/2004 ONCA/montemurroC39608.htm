<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The Crown appeals the ruling of the trial judge, which excluded the evidence 
  obtained from the initial wiretap authorization issued under s. 185 of the Criminal 
  Code. The Crown advances two submissions in support of its position: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The trial judge erred in failing to hold that there was 
  at least some evidence that supported the authorization; and</p>
<p class="indent">2. Alternatively, even if the search following the wiretap authorization 
  infringed the respondents' rights under s. 8 of the Charter, the trial judge 
  erred in failing to admit the evidence under s. 24(2).</p>
<p>
  We agree with both submissions.</p>
<p>
  [2] The affidavit evidence in support of the authorization was not challenged. 
  That evidence meets the requirements of both ss. 186(1)(a) and (b) of the Criminal 
  Code. Dealing first with s. 186(1)(a), the respondents do not contest that there 
  are reasonable and probable grounds to believe that an offence has been committed. 
  On this branch of the statutory prerequisites, the only question is whether 
  Corporal Barrington's affidavit provides some basis to say that the authorization 
  will afford evidence of the offence. We are satisfied that it does. Corporal 
  Barrington's unchallenged evidence at paras. 8-16 of his affidavit gives reasonable 
  grounds to believe that marijuana was being imported, and intercepting Mr. Richard 
  Lepp's communications will afford evidence of that offence. </p>
<p>
  [3] Dealing next with s. 186(1)(b) of the Code, the question of investigative 
  necessity, we are satisfied that the evidence of Corporal Barrington at paras. 
  80-85 of his affidavit shows that other investigative procedures are unlikely 
  to succeed. Corporal Barrington's statements could perhaps have been more fully 
  explained, but his evidence is not contested and does give some basis for meeting 
  the investigative necessity requirement. For these reasons we would give effect 
  to the Crown's first submission. </p>
<p>
  [4] However, even were we to accept the trial judge's ruling that the wiretap 
  was not authorized and therefore the subsequent search infringed the respondents' 
  s. 8 rights, we think that the seized evidence should have been admitted. The 
  respondents acknowledge that the evidence was not conscriptive and that its 
  admission would not affect the fairness of the trial. Although a breach of privacy 
  rights is always serious, in this case the seriousness of the breach is diminished 
  because of the following: the police reasonably relied on a judicial authorization 
  issued by the Superior Court; that authorization appeared valid on its face; 
  and the respondents have not alleged that Corporal Barrington's affidavit was 
  tainted by misrepresentation or non-disclosure. </p>
<p>
  [5] Finally, excluding the evidence would bring the administration of justice 
  into disrepute. In addition to what we have already said, we point out that 
  this was a large?scale drug smuggling operation involving serious offences.</p>
<p>
  [6] Accordingly, we allow the appeal, set aside the acquittals and order a new 
  trial. </p>
