<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants are a group of former senior executives at the respondent 
  Call-Net Enterprises Inc. ("Call-Net"). They appeal the judgment of 
  Justice Joan Lax in which she determined that in the autumn of 1999 there had 
  been no "change in control" at Call-Net. Accordingly, she held, various 
  compensation provisions in the employment contracts of senior executives were 
  not triggered.</p>
<p>
  [2] In 1999, Call-Net was experiencing serious financial difficulties. Shareholders 
  were upset and critical of the performance of senior management, especially 
  the president, Juri Koor, and the chief financial officer, the appellant Vincent 
  Salvati.</p>
<p>
  [3] In August 1999, Crescendo Partners L.P. ("Crescendo") informed 
  Call-Net that it had obtained sufficient share ownership (13.3 per cent) to 
  requisition a special meeting of Call-Net which it scheduled for October 14, 
  1999. The stated purpose of the meeting was a Crescendo resolution to remove 
  and replace six of the nine members of the Call-Net Board of Directors.</p>
<p>
  [4] In the face of Crescendo's challenge, Call-Net supplemented the existing 
  employment agreements with its senior executives with new Change of Control 
  Agreements. These new agreements provided generous employment benefits to senior 
  executives in a "change in control" scenario. The definition of "change 
  in control" in section 1.1(i) of the Agreements is a long one. The part 
  of the definition the appellants rely on in their case deems a change in control 
  to have occurred if any person acquired "the right to control or direct 
  &#133; 35 per cent or more of the combined voting power of the Corporation".</p>
<p>
  [5] In tandem with the new change of control agreements, Call-Net entered into 
  a trust agreement with Montreal Trust. Call-Net deposited $27,569,062 CDN and 
  $2,402,600 US to be used to pay out benefits to its executives if the company 
  experienced a "change in control" and the executives elected to invoke 
  the provisions in their new agreements.</p>
<p>
  [6] In the weeks leading up to the special meeting, Crescendo solicited the 
  proxies of shareholders. On the eve of the meeting, it appeared to Call-Net's 
  management that Crescendo had enough votes to carry its proposed resolution. 
  The risk for Call-Net was that it might be taken over by a corporate raider 
  whose goal would be to sell off its assets. However, there was also a risk for 
  Crescendo if it proceeded with the special meeting. The risk related to change 
  of control provisions in Call-Net's bond indenture agreements. Under those agreements, 
  the passing of the Crescendo resolution would have triggered a change in control 
  pursuant to which Call-Net would have been compelled to repurchase the bonds 
  for $2.2 billion. This, too, would have destroyed the existing company. Crescendo 
  needed the bond holders to waive these agreements; this had not happened before 
  October 14.</p>
<p>
  [7] October 14, 1999 dawned and, perhaps not surprisingly, negotiations took 
  place, a settlement was reached, and the special meeting never took place. One 
  of the terms of the agreement was that Crescendo was permitted to nominate three 
  directors on a slightly expanded ten member board.</p>
<p>
  [8] After the dust settled, ten senior managers invoked the Change of Control 
  Agreement. The five appellants sought payouts from the trust fund as follows: 
  Vincent Salvati - $1,366,328.76; Andrew Krupski - $1,275,366; Ken Wilson - $1,564,600; 
  Brock Robertson - $706,582; and Irene Panageas - $243,576. Call-Net refused 
  to pay these amounts because, in its view, there had been no "change in 
  control" at the company before or on October 14.</p>
<p>
  [9] A trial took place before Lax J. in December 2001. In a comprehensive judgment 
  released on January 28, 2002, she held that the former executives were not entitled 
  to receive payments from the trust fund. She concluded that Crescendo's accumulation 
  of proxies relating to more than 35 per cent of Call-Net's shares did not amount 
  to a "change in control" within the meaning of the Change of Control 
  Agreement and the trust agreement. Near the end of her reasons, the trial judge 
  concluded: </p>
<p class="indent"> I agree with Call-Net that the language of section 1.1(i) was 
  intended to deal with an actual take-over bid or other transaction, under which 
  control is actually assumed, and not the mere accumulation of proxies. This 
  is the only interpretation that gives effect to all of the provisions of the 
  agreement, is consistent with the meaning of control or direct in corporate 
  law, reflects accurately the nature of the power conferred by a proxy and addresses 
  the commercial purpose of the Change of Control Agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">I conclude that no change in control as defined in section 1.01 
  of the Trust Agreement and section 1.1(i) of the Change of Control Agreement 
  occurred. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellants (five of the ten original claimants) appeal the trial judge's 
  decision. They contend that the trial judge misconstrued the general purpose 
  of change of control agreements and misinterpreted the wording of the specific 
  Call-Net Change of Control Agreement. We disagree.</p>
<p>
  [11] The trial judge described the general purpose of change of control agreements 
  in this fashion: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A Change of Control Agreement is thus a protective mechanism for both the corporation 
  and the executive and has a legitimate business purpose. It is intended to retain 
  executives and ensure their loyalty to the corporation in a time of uncertainty. 
  It offers financial security to an executive who is either terminated or resigns 
  after a change in control. As it has the potential to cause substantial financial 
  exposure for a corporation, it must be entered into with the best interests 
  of the corporation in mind. Otherwise, it has no legitimate corporate or business 
  purpose. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [12] In our view, this is an accurate description. A change of control agreement 
  is not just for the benefit of the senior executives it covers. The benefit 
  to the executives is directly linked to the interests of the company. As the 
  appellant Salvati recognized in his factum: "The purpose is fulfilled if 
  the key executives remain at their posts, loyally serving the best interests 
  of the corporation, until the outcome of the siege is determined, one way or 
  the other."</p>
<p>
  [13] We agree with the respondent that the purpose of change of control agreements 
  is completely undercut if the appellants' interpretation of the Call-Net agreement 
  is adopted. The appellants' interpretation is that the mere acquisition of proxies 
  totalling 35 per cent of the voting shares of the company triggers a change 
  of control in the company within the meaning of the agreements. The result would 
  be that senior executives would have an incentive to leave the company at a 
  moment of turmoil and fragility in the company and reap huge financial rewards 
  for doing so. This is the opposite of the appellants' own stated purpose of 
  such agreements, namely retaining "key executives &#133; at their posts, 
  loyally serving the best interests of the corporation, until the outcome of 
  the siege is determined, one way or the other."</p>
<p>
  [14] In the end, we agree with Mr. Royce's somewhat vivid description of the 
  consequences of the appellants' interpretation of the Call-Net Change of Control 
  Agreement: "If the appellants' interpretation is correct, then at a moment 
  of conflict and uncertainty in the company, senior management would have the 
  right to open the till, take out the money and head for the hills. The company 
  would then be forced to tell its shareholders and the public, in mid-battle, 
  'our management is gone and we are $27 million poorer'". This can hardly 
  be seen as an interpretation that recognizes that the purpose of change of control 
  agreements is, as the trial judge stated and as the appellants recognized, the 
  protection of senior executives, but in the context of retaining their loyalty 
  at a time of turmoil for the company.</p>
<p>
  [15] In summary, we agree with the trial judge that the mere accumulation of 
  proxies is not a sufficient foundation to trigger a change in control within 
  the wording of s. 1.1(i) of the Change of Control Agreement. We are satisfied 
  that bearing in mind the entire definition of change in control, the evident 
  purpose of the agreements and the legal requirements imposed on a proxy holder, 
  Crescendo did not acquire the right to "control or direct" 35 per 
  cent or more of the combined voting power of the corporation.</p>
<p>
  [16] Finally, we note that the appellants submit that the trial judge erred 
  in failing to answer other questions submitted to her about the interpretation 
  of the agreement. We disagree. Those other questions flowed from a determination 
  that s. 1.1(i) of the agreement had been triggered. Since the trial judge made 
  the opposite determination, the other questions were moot and she was entitled 
  to decline to answer them.</p>
<p>
  [17] The trial judge's reasons are comprehensive, sound and, in a word, impeccable. 
  The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $34,000.</p>
