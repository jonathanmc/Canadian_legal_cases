<p>On appeal from judgment of Justice Denis J. Power of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated October 23, 2003.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal from the judgment of Justice Denis Power of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated October 23, 2003. In his judgment, the motion judge granted 
  the defendants' (respondents') motion under rule 21.01(3)(a) of the Rules of 
  Civil Procedure to strike out the plaintiff's (appellant's) cause of action.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant was an employee in the Public Service of Canada. From 1978 
  to 1998 she worked as a prison guard and supervisor in Kingston for the Correctional 
  Service of Canada ("CSC"). She resigned from the CSC on March 4, 1998.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant alleges that she suffered extensive discrimination and harassment 
  on the part of the personal defendants and the Government of Canada.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant commenced an action sounding in discrimination, harassment, 
  defamation and breach of fiduciary duty. The Respondents brought their motion 
  to strike the action on the basis that the appellant was precluded from resorting 
  to the courts; rather, her recourse was either invocation of the grievance procedure 
  under the Public Service Staff Relations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-35 ("the 
  PSSRA") or making a complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission pursuant 
  to the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6.</p>
<p>
  [5] The motion judge agreed with the respondents' position. In comprehensive 
  reasons, he held: (1) the respondents' alleged misconduct was specifically prohibited 
  by Articles M?16 and M?17 of the collective agreement; (2) disputes relating 
  to these areas of misconduct were capable of adjudication pursuant to the collective 
  agreement and the PSSRA; and (3) in addition, the appellant's claims of sex 
  and age discrimination were capable of adjudication under the CHRA. The motion 
  judge concluded that "the essential dispute between the parties is one 
  that arises from conduct prohibited by the collective agreement". Accordingly, 
  the appellant needed to pursue either the grievance procedure under the collective 
  agreement and the PSSRA and/or a complaint under the CHRA.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant challenges the motion judge's decision on four grounds.</p>
<p>
  [7] First, the appellant contends that the PSSRA does not limit the appellant 
  to only the grievance process for her complaints about misconduct in the workplace.</p>
<p>
  [8] We disagree. In Gaignard v. Canada (Attorney General), (2003), 67 O.R. (3d) 
  611 at 615?16 (C.A.), a recent case dealing with the interpretation of the grievance 
  provisions of the PSSRA, Goudge J.A. stated that it was essential to "focus 
  &#133; on the essential character of the dispute, to determine if it must be 
  resolved by arbitration and not by the courts." He then reviewed the considerations 
  for assessing the essential character of a particular dispute, including the 
  facts giving rise to the dispute, the ambit of the collective agreement, and 
  whether the arbitration process provided by the collective agreement can furnish 
  an effective remedy for the dispute. Goudge J.A. summarized his analysis at 
  pp. 617-78:</p>
<p class="indent"> These considerations can in effect be consolidated by asking 
  whether, considering the facts of the dispute, the language of the collective 
  agreement, and the effectiveness of the remedy provided by the arbitration mechanism, 
  this is the kind of dispute that the parties intended to be finally resolved 
  there. If so, the principle of exclusive jurisdiction applies to exclude court 
  action. Determining the essential character of the dispute in this way is consistent 
  with the reality that the terms of the collective agreement both as to substance 
  and as to dispute resolution reflect the shared intention of the parties. It 
  provides some assurance that the disputes to be exclusively resolved by arbitration 
  are ones that the process was designed to deal with.</p>
<p>
  [9] In the present case, the motion judge explicitly adopted and applied "the 
  essential character of the dispute" test for determining whether exclusive 
  jurisdiction with respect to the appellant's claims resided with the PSSRA regime. 
  He concluded that "the essential dispute between the parties is one that 
  arises from conduct prohibited by the collective agreement".</p>
<p>
  [10] We agree. Sexual harassment and discrimination on the basis of sex and 
  age are specifically prohibited by the collective agreement. Discrimination 
  is also conduct prohibited by the CHRA which, by virtue of the collective agreement 
  (Article M?38.02: "where there is another administrative procedure provided 
  by or under any Act of Parliament to deal with the employee's specific complaint, 
  such procedure must be followed"), is also a route available to the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [11] The appellant's second submission is that the motion judge erred by failing 
  to recognize that the grievance process under the collective agreement and the 
  PSSRA was insufficient in that it did not provide the appellant with an unfettered 
  right to independent third party adjudication of her claims: see Guenette v. 
  Canada (Attorney General), (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 601 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [12] We disagree. The motion judge held: "At all relevant times the [appellant] 
  was an employee of the Public Service of Canada and was subject to the terms 
  of the aforesaid collective agreement and the PSSRA." There is no appeal 
  of this finding. Accordingly, the grievance procedure under the collective agreement 
  and the PSSRA is available to the appellant. This includes independent third 
  party adjudication, unlike Guenette where the employer conceded that the employees 
  did not have access to such an adjudication. Moreover, there is nothing to prevent 
  the appellant from making a complaint under the CHRA to the Canadian Human Rights 
  Commission which could well lead to a hearing before the Canadian Human Rights 
  Tribunal, which is also an independent third party adjudicator.</p>
<p>
  [13] The appellant's third submission is that the motion judge's decision does 
  not take sufficient account of the fact that defamation in the workplace is 
  an independent tort and is actionable in the courts. This submission ignores 
  the core of the relevant test - it is the essential character of the dispute 
  that controls the jurisdictional analysis. In the present case, the essential 
  character of the dispute is workplace discrimination and harassment, not defamation. 
  It is noteworthy that in the seminal case of Weber v. Ontario Hydro, [1995] 
  2 S.C.R. 929 at 955, McLachlin J. cautioned that "one must look not to 
  the characterization of the wrong, but to the facts giving rise to the dispute" 
  because to do otherwise would "leave it open to innovative pleaders to 
  evade the legislative prohibition on parallel court actions by raising new and 
  imaginative causes of action."</p>
<p>
  [14] The appellant's fourth submission is that the motion judge erred by striking 
  out the appellant's defamation pleading because it lacked sufficient particulars, 
  without giving the appellant leave to amend the pleading. In light of our conclusion 
  on the third issue, this submission becomes irrelevant. Even a perfect defamation 
  pleading would not elevate the alleged defamation to "essential character 
  of the dispute" status.</p>
<p>
  [15] The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $3,000.00, inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
