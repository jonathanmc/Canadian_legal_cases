<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] All of the parties to this appeal, including the respondent Diane Marion 
  Pirner, seek their costs on the appeal. The appellant Gertrude Pirner-Moser 
  was successful on the appeal on the basis that the application judge had no 
  jurisdiction to make the order that the appellant convey the cottage property 
  to Diane Pirner. The fact remains, however, that the respondent Thomas Pirner 
  has been in arrears on his payments of child support for some considerable period 
  of time. This litigation was part of Diane Pirner's attempt to secure those 
  arrears for the benefit of the children. Be that as it may, we can see no basis 
  for an order that Thomas Pirner pay Diane Pirner's costs of this appeal. The 
  dispute was between Gertrude Pirner-Moser and Diane Moser. The involvement of 
  Thomas Pirner did not increase Diane Pirner's costs of responding to the appeal. 
  On the other hand, it would be wholly inequitable to require Diane Pirner to 
  pay Thomas Pirner's costs, given the history of this matter.</p>
<p>[2] Gertrude Pirner-Moser seeks costs on a substantial indemnity basis because 
  Diane Pirner undertook numerous ill-advised and unsuccessful interlocutory steps 
  in this court. We agree that those steps were ill advised and resulted in unnecessary 
  costs. We are not, however, prepared to make an order for costs on a substantial 
  indemnity basis. As we have noted, this litigation was a product of Thomas Pirner's 
  continuing attempts to evade payment of support, which have left Diane Pirner 
  and the children in reduced circumstances. This particular piece of litigation 
  originates in Thomas Pirner's conveyance of the cottage in breach of the Family 
  Law Act. Had Diane Pirner moved promptly in consequence of Jennings J.'s Order, 
  she could have set aside that conveyance. Thereafter, as a result of transactions 
  that seemed to have benefited Gertrude Pirner-Moser at the expense of the Pirner 
  Trust (in which the children were beneficiaries), the cottage property is now 
  out of the reach of Diane Pirner and the children to secure the arrears.</p>
<p>[3] Given this history, it would be unfair to award anything more than modest 
  costs to Gertrude Pirner-Moser. We make an order for costs in her favour only 
  because of the unnecessary expense engendered by the ill-conceived steps. This 
  case is not governed by the Family Law Rules and we think this order is required 
  having regard to the factors set out in Andrews v. Andrews (1980), 32 O.R. (2d) 
  29 (C.A.).</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, the respondent Diane Pirner will pay costs to the appellant 
  Gertrude Pirner-Moser in the amount of $3,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
