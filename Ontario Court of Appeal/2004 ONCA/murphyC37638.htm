<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John R. Belleghem of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated December 31, 2001.</p>
<p>
  CRONK J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] These proceedings arise from the wrongful dismissal and subsequent defamation 
  of a real estate agent by one of the principals of his former employer, a real 
  estate brokerage firm in Ontario. </p>
<p>
  [2] Three questions require determination by this court. First, where a plaintiff 
  is slandered by the same person on two separate occasions and an action concerning 
  the first slander is statute-barred due to the expiry of a limitation period, 
  is it permissible in assessing damages for the second slander to have regard 
  to the consequences of the first slander? Second, where a plaintiff prosecutes 
  separate causes of action against two defendants in a single action and is unsuccessful 
  against one defendant but is successful against the other defendant, is it a 
  wrongful exercise of a trial judge's discretion to deny costs to the successful 
  defendant and to require the unsuccessful defendant to pay the plaintiff's entire 
  costs of the litigation? Third, on the facts of this case, did the trial judge 
  err in declining to require reimbursement to the plaintiff of contributions 
  made by him under his employment contract to a group advertising fund? </p>
<p>
  I. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  (1) The Parties, the Ad Fund and the Events</p>
<p>
  (a) Parties</p>
<p>
  [3] In about 1980, Frank Polzler obtained the rights to operate "RE/MAX" 
  real estate brokerage firms in Ontario and Eastern Canada from RE/MAX of America, 
  Inc., sub-sequently known as RE/MAX International, Inc. ("RE/MAX International"). 
  Polzler's company, RE/MAX Ontario-Atlantic Canada Inc. ("RE/MAX Ontario") 
  granted a RE/MAX franchise to RE/MAX Professionals Inc. ("Professionals"). 
  Various other RE/MAX franchises were created over time, including RE/MAX Supreme 
  Realty Limited ("Supreme"), which was owned by Leo Latini. </p>
<p>
  [4] Initially, Professionals was owned by Polzler. By 1989, Pam Alexander, Polzler's 
  daughter, and Steven Morris, Professionals' office manager, had acquired ownership 
  of Professionals.</p>
<p>
  (b) Ad Fund</p>
<p>
  [5] Under RE/MAX International's business model, RE/MAX offices pooled marketing 
  and advertising costs, subscribed to a common business organization and practices, 
  and marketed their real estate agents to the public as "RE/MAX" agents. 
  Each agent contributed to a group advertising fund established by regional RE/MAX 
  brokerage firms to finance the collective business promotion efforts of participating 
  RE/MAX agents (the "Ad Fund"). In Ontario, the Ad Fund was initially 
  administered by RE/MAX Ontario. Subsequently, RE/MAX Promotions Inc. ("Promotions"), 
  was created to admin-ister the Ad Fund.</p>
<p>
  [6] In July 1982, RE/MAX International issued a directive ("Directive 801") 
  con-cerning institutional advertising fund administration. As relevant to these 
  proceedings, Directive 801 detailed those expenditures properly to be made from 
  regional institutional advertising funds and those expenditures which were unauthorized. 
  Such items as recruiting and awards banquet expenses fell within the latter 
  category.</p>
<p>
  [7] Directive 801 was revised in March 1988 by RE/MAX International. The revised 
  version also provided that expenditures from regional group advertising funds 
  should not be made on such items as recruiting and awards banquets. The revised 
  version also stipulated: "All monies paid into the Regional Group Advertising 
  Fund become the property of the Fund" and "Once paid, there will be 
  no refunds of Regional Group Advertising Fees." </p>
<p>
  (c) Events</p>
<p>
  [8] Edmond Murphy was employed by Professionals as a real estate agent from 
  August 1983 until September 1989. His written contract of employment with Professionals, 
  dated December 18, 1986, stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Employee shall pay such regional institutional advertising levy as is from 
  time to time set by [RE/MAX Ontario] to be payable by RE/MAX sales person[s] 
  generally. Such payments will be used only in respect of advertising costs incurred 
  by [RE/MAX Ontario].</p>
<p>
  During his employment with Professionals, Murphy contributed $4,875 to the Ad 
  Fund. </p>
<p>
  [9] Murphy and Morris had a troubled working relationship. At a meeting of Professionals' 
  agents in early September 1989, Murphy and Morris exchanged angry words concerning 
  Professionals' policy for the allocation among agents of "cold calls" 
  from prospective clients. The argument continued after the meeting, shifting 
  to complaints by Murphy regarding the administration of the Ad Fund. Later the 
  same day, Morris informed Murphy that he was to leave Professionals' employ 
  immediately. The next day, Morris met with Murphy and again indicated that Murphy 
  was to leave Professionals. Murphy refused to do so, insisting on the notice 
  period for termination of his employment that he felt was provided for under 
  his employment contract. Ultimately, Morris prevailed and Murphy left the employ 
  of Professionals on September 13, 1989. Murphy claimed that he was wrongfully 
  dismissed. Professionals maintained that he had voluntarily submitted his resignation. 
  Shortly after his departure from Professionals, Murphy began to work as a RE/MAX 
  agent with Supreme. </p>
<p>
  [10] About six months later, on Friday, March 23, 1990, Murphy went to Professionals' 
  office to speak with Morris because he believed that Professionals was not forwarding 
  his business calls to him at Supreme, resulting in a loss to Murphy of prospective 
  business. Murphy was told that Morris was not in the office. After visiting 
  with various of the agents and staff of Professionals, Murphy left without speaking 
  to Morris. </p>
<p>
  [11] On the following Monday, March 26, 1990, Morris telephoned Latini at Supreme. 
  According to Latini, Morris was irate. Morris told Latini that Murphy had gone 
  to Professionals' office with a gun and had threatened people, including Morris. 
  He said that the police had been called. Morris also told Latini that he should 
  get Murphy "out of the system", and that Murphy was "a dangerous 
  man" (collectively, the "March Statements"). Latini promised 
  to investigate the matter. </p>
<p>
  [12] Latini then arranged for one of Supreme's assistant managers to seek a 
  report from Murphy, with instructions that Murphy provide a copy of the report 
  to RE/MAX Ontario and to the police. Murphy provided the report in the form 
  of a letter to Latini dated March 27, 1990. In his letter, Murphy denied the 
  allegations made by Morris and stated, in part: "I can only infer that 
  the response made by Management at [Professionals] was a premeditated and deliberate 
  attempt to character assassination [sic] and to destroy my reputation." 
  Murphy also requested an explanation for Morris' allegations. </p>
<p>
  [13] Latini accepted Murphy's letter, but warned him that if any future difficulties 
  arose, he would be fired. Although Latini also forwarded a copy of Murphy's 
  letter, containing Murphy's request for an explanation, to Professionals and 
  to RE/MAX Ontario, no response was forthcoming from either company. Nonetheless, 
  Murphy's employment with Supreme continued. </p>
<p>
  [14] One of Murphy's former co-workers at Professionals later telephoned him 
  to warn him that Professionals had called the police and that he should stay 
  away from Professionals' office. According to Murphy, although he was never 
  contacted by the police, he was required frequently to respond to people in 
  the industry who asked him if he had really gone to Professionals' office with 
  a gun. According to Latini, Murphy became known in the real estate community 
  as "the madman". He was the target of numerous jokes concerning "guns" 
  and "bombs", and rumours flourished concerning his alleged conduct. 
  </p>
<p>
  [15] In late August 1990, Morris met Latini for lunch at a restaurant to discuss 
  various business matters. No one else was present at the lunch. When the subject 
  of Murphy came up, Morris again told Latini that Murphy "had a gun" 
  and reiterated that Murphy was "a dangerous man". Morris also inquired 
  if Murphy was still working with Latini and said: "We [need] to get him 
  out of the system" (collectively, the "August Statements"). </p>
<p>
  [16] Supreme's business failed in October 1990. Thereafter, Murphy worked for 
  sev-eral different RE/MAX brokerage firms in Ontario. </p>
<p>
  [17] Morris left Professionals in November 1990. Upon his departure, Alexander 
  ac-quired his interest in the company. Morris subsequently filed an assignment 
  in bank-ruptcy.</p>
<p>
  (2) The Litigation</p>
<p>
  (a) Proceedings Before the Trial Judge</p>
<p>
  [18] On August 20, 1992, Murphy sued Alexander, Morris, Professionals, RE/MAX 
  Ontario and Polzler, seeking damages as against all of the defendants, save 
  for RE/MAX Ontario, for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, wrongful 
  dismissal, unlawful interference in economic relations and injurious falsehoods, 
  together with pre- and post-judgment interest and costs. </p>
<p>
  [19] Murphy's claims as against RE/MAX Ontario concerned the administration 
  of the Ad Fund and the propriety of certain expenditures made from it. Murphy 
  asserted that his contributions and those of other RE/MAX agents to the Ad Fund 
  were used for unauthorized purposes. He sought a declaration that RE/MAX Ontario 
  owed him a fiduciary duty, an accounting of all contributions made to and all 
  disbursements made from the Ad Fund for the period January 1, 1983 to September 
  30, 1989, damages in an amount equivalent to the amount of his own contributions 
  to the Ad Fund that were not spent on advertising, damages for injurious falsehoods, 
  general and punitive damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, and costs. </p>
<p>
  [20] Murphy's action as against Alexander and Polzler was dismissed in November 
  1992. Morris did not defend Murphy's action and was noted in default. Murphy's 
  action against the remaining defendants was tried before Belleghem J. of the 
  Superior Court of Justice over 11 days in February and April 2001. Morris did 
  not testify at trial and, hence, did not deny the March and August Statements. 
  </p>
<p>
  [21] In his reasons for judgment dated December 31, 2001, the trial judge held 
  that: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) Murphy was wrongfully dismissed by Professionals, in breach 
  of his employment contract;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the March and August Statements by Morris were defamatory 
  and motivated by malice;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) Professionals was vicariously liable for Morris' de-famation 
  of Murphy;</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) Murphy's cause of action regarding the March State-ments 
  was statute-barred by virtue of the expiry of the two year limitation period 
  established under s. 45(1)(i) of the Limitations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L. 15 
  (the "Act");</p>
<p class="indent">(v) Murphy's action as against Morris should be stayed because 
  Murphy failed to obtain court authorization permitting him to continue the action 
  against Morris after Morris' bankruptcy; and</p>
<p class="indent">(vi) Murphy was not entitled to an accounting concerning the 
  Ad Fund or to the return of his own contributions to the Ad Fund.</p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge awarded Murphy the total amount of $90,000 as against Professionals 
  on account of damages for defamation, plus the amount of $15,000, also as against 
  Professionals, on account of damages for wrongful dismissal. Murphy's claims 
  against RE/MAX Ontario were dismissed. By supplementary reasons dated August 
  29, 2002, the trial judge awarded Murphy pre-judgment interest and his costs 
  of the litigation on a partial indemnity basis as against Professionals, including 
  his costs of prosecuting his unsuccessful claims against RE/MAX Ontario. He 
  declined to award costs in favour of RE/MAX Ontario.</p>
<p>
  (b) Appeal and Cross-appeal</p>
<p>
  [23] Professionals and RE/MAX Ontario do not challenge the trial judge's liability 
  findings. Rather, Professionals seeks to vary the trial judgment by restricting 
  the damages awarded for defamation to only those damages flowing solely from 
  the August Statements. As well, both companies seek leave to appeal the costs 
  disposition of the trial judge and, if leave be granted, appeal his costs award, 
  seeking to vary it: (i) by directing that Professionals is not liable to pay 
  any costs incurred by Murphy in advancing his unsuccessful claims against RE/MAX 
  Ontario; and (ii) by awarding RE/MAX Ontario its costs of the action on a partial 
  indemnity scale. </p>
<p>
  [24] Murphy, in turn, cross-appeals from the trial judge's finding that he is 
  not entitled to reimbursement of his own contributions to the Ad Fund. He does 
  not challenge the trial judge's holding that he is not entitled to a general 
  accounting of the contributions made to and the disbursements made from the 
  Ad Fund. </p>
<p>
  [25] For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, in part, by setting 
  aside the award of damages for defamation and the associated award of pre-judgment 
  interest, substituting in their stead orders requiring Professionals to pay 
  Murphy general damages for defamation in the sum of $10,000, together with pre-judgment 
  interest calculated in accordance with the trial judge's pre-judgment interest 
  ruling, varied as necessary to conform with these reasons. I would also grant 
  leave to appeal costs and dismiss the balance of the appeal and the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  II. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [26] Professionals and RE/MAX Ontario assert that the trial judge erred: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) in his assessment of damages for defamation, by confusing 
  the damages arising from the March State-ments with the damages flowing from 
  the August Statements, thereby awarding damages in respect of the cause of action 
  in defamation that was statute-barred; and</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) in his assessment of costs, by declining to award costs 
  to RE/MAX Ontario and by ordering Professionals to pay Murphy's entire costs 
  of the action. </p>
<p>
  As well, Murphy asserts in his cross-appeal that the trial judge erred in failing 
  to require reimbursement to him of his personal contributions to the Ad Fund. 
  As the Ad Fund claims are relevant to the trial judge's assessment of costs, 
  I will address the issues in these proceedings in the following order: (1) the 
  assessment of damages for defamation; (2) the Ad Fund claims; and (3) the assessment 
  of costs.</p>
<p>
  III. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) The Assessment of Damages for Defamation</p>
<p>
  [27] The trial judge's award of damages to Murphy for defamation consisted of: 
  (i) $45,000 for special damages concerning ongoing loss of income from 1990 
  to 1994; (ii) $30,000 for general damages; and (iii) $15,000 for aggravated 
  damages. The trial judge declined to award punitive damages.</p>
<p>
  [28] Professionals argues that in his assessment of these damages, the trial 
  judge confused the damages arising from the March Statements with the damages 
  flowing from the August Statements, thereby improperly awarding compensation 
  for injuries arising from the March Statements notwithstanding that Murphy's 
  claims concerning them were not actionable. I agree that in assessing damages 
  for defamation, the trial judge was obliged to distinguish the damages flowing 
  from the March Statements, in respect of which an action was barred due to the 
  expiry of a limitation period, from the damages flowing from the August Statements, 
  in respect of which the prescription period was not engaged. I also agree that 
  the trail judge failed to draw this distinction in this case and that this failure 
  constitutes reversible error.</p>
<p>
  [29] An award of general or aggravated damages for defamation is intended to 
  com-pensate the injured plaintiff for the harm occasioned by the defamatory 
  statement. General damages in defamation cases are presumed from the fact of 
  the slander or of the publication of the false statement. The law presumes that 
  some damage will flow in the ordinary course from the invasion of the plaintiff's 
  rights: see Ratcliffe v. Evans, [1892] 2 Q.B. 524 at 528 (C.A.) and Hill v. 
  Church of Scientology of Toronto (1995), 126 D.L.R. (4th) 129 at 176 (S.C.C.). 
  In such cases, general damages are said to be "at large", in the sense 
  that an award of damages may include elements for reputational loss, injured 
  feelings, bad or good conduct by either party, or punishment. In essence, such 
  an award is not limited to the pecuniary loss that has been specifically established: 
  see Cassell &amp; Co. v. Broome, [1972] A.C. 1027 at 1071 and 1073 (H.L.), per 
  Lord Hailsham. The presumption of damages, however, may be rebutted. </p>
<p>
  [30] In this case, Latini, Murphy's employer at the time of both the March and 
  the August Statements, testified that the March Statements made him "pretty 
  nervous" and "quite terrified" because he was uncertain of what 
  action Murphy might be capable in the circumstances. He also said that the rumours 
  concerning Murphy were rampant in the real estate community and that the circle 
  of realtors involved with Supreme all knew who the "madman" was after 
  the March 1990 incident.</p>
<p>
  [31] In connection with the August Statements, Latini testified that he did 
  not repeat the August Statements to anyone else and that they did not cause 
  him to further investigate Murphy's conduct. He also said, however, that to 
  the date of the trial, he was still being asked whether he had "talked 
  to the madman lately". </p>
<p>
  [32] Murphy testified at trial that he continued to be asked about the alleged 
  gun incident consistently, "even to the present day". However, he 
  made no mention in his testimony of the August Statements or of events flowing 
  therefrom. </p>
<p>
  [33] Thus, as asserted by Professionals, there was evidence before the trial 
  judge which, if accepted by him, would support the conclusion that most, and 
  arguably all, of the damages sustained by Murphy flowed from the March Statements. 
  </p>
<p>
  [34] Murphy does not cross-appeal from the trial judge's holding that his claims 
  concerning the March Statements were statute-barred. In addition, Murphy does 
  not dispute that each occasion of slander is a separate delict, giving rise 
  to a separate cause of action and a separate head of damages. Consequently, 
  Murphy is not entitled to recover damages for those injuries and losses arising 
  from the March Statements, although he is entitled to recover damages for defamation 
  in relation to the August Statements. </p>
<p>
  [35] Given these circumstances, it was incumbent on the trial judge to distinguish 
  between the damages flowing from the August Statements in comparison to the 
  damages flowing from the March Statements, to the extent that the evidence permitted 
  him to do so. Read as a whole, in my view, the trial judge's reasons for judgment 
  indicate that he failed to do so. I reach this conclusion for the following 
  reasons. </p>
<p>
  [36] The trial judge began his assessment of damages for defamation by stating: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Moving on to damages then, I am satisfied that Murphy's reputation in the real 
  estate community was damaged as a result of the defamation by Morris.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> I am satisfied it is more likely than not Murphy lost some 
  real estate deals because of his tarnished reputation.</p>
<p>
  In making those findings, the trial judge made no reference to the fact that 
  Murphy's action concerning the March Statements and, hence, his claim for relief 
  regarding the March 1990 slander, was statute-barred. </p>
<p>
  [37] The trial judge next considered Murphy's claim for special damages. He 
  observed that it was "difficult, if not impossible" to separate the 
  special damages sustained by Murphy in consequence of "Morris' defamation 
  of him" from the special damages occasioned by Morris' wrongful termination 
  of Murphy's employment. He made no mention, however, of the need to separate 
  the damages sustained by Murphy as a result of the March Statements from those 
  damages arising from the August Statements. As well, in quantifying the special 
  damages to be awarded to Murphy on account of lost income for the years 1990 
  to 1994, no differentiation was made by the trial judge between the damages 
  attributable to the March Statements and those flowing from the August Statements; 
  nor was an analysis undertaken as to whether, given Latini's evidence at trial 
  regarding the August Statements, the August Statements in fact caused Murphy 
  to lose income in those years. </p>
<p>
  [38] In addition, no such distinction was drawn by the trial judge in assessing 
  the general and aggravated damages to be awarded to Murphy. To the contrary, 
  the trial judge's reasons indicate that he focused on the August Statements 
  as aggravating the damages occasioned by the March Statements. The trial judge 
  wrote in that regard: </p>
<p class="indent"> Morris displayed actual malice. He knew the allegations were 
  false or was reckless as to their veracity.</p>
<p class="indent">The nature of the words used border on vicious&#133;The fact 
  that Murphy repeated those words demonstrates ongoing hostility and malice towards 
  Murphy.</p>
<p class="indent">The use of the words about getting Murphy "out of the system" 
  strikes at the heart of his vocation as a real estate agent. Murphy's reputation 
  in the real estate community as being "the mad man" testified to by witnesses 
  demonstrates that the story "caught on". It is impossible to determine how widespread 
  it became. There can be no doubt whatever that Mr. Murphy was personally wounded 
  by this vicious attack by his superior during the ongoing course of trying to 
  "remove him from the (Re/Max) system". His former boss continued to press these 
  allegations to those vocationally closest to Murphy, undoubtedly much to Murphy's 
  chagrin [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [39] As well, in commenting earlier in his reasons on the August Statements, 
  the trial judge indicated that they were "part and parcel of the ongoing 
  tarnishment of Murphy's reputation in the real estate community and, as a result, 
  contributed to the damages sustained by Murphy as a result of this particular 
  defamation [emphasis added]". This statement again indicates that the trial 
  judge regarded the August Statements as aggrav-ating the damages sustained by 
  Murphy in consequence of the earlier slander in March 1990. </p>
<p>
  [40] Murphy argues that in assessing damages for defamation, particularly where, 
  as here, malice is demonstrated, it is permissible to have regard to additional 
  defamatory remarks made by the defendant, both before and after the defamation 
  sued upon, to show surrounding circumstances and a history of animus between 
  the parties. It is true that in assessing damages for defamation, particularly 
  aggravated damages, the court is entitled to consider the entire conduct of 
  the defendant, both before and after an action is commenced, as well as in court 
  during the trial: see for example, Cassell &amp; Co., supra, at 1071-72 and 
  Hill v. Church of Scientology, supra, at paras. 182-83 and 189. Thus, R.E. Brown, 
  in The Law of Defamation in Canada, 2d ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1994) states 
  at 1500: "The reiteration of the defamatory charge at different times and 
  at different places by the defendant may be taken into consideration in fixing 
  the damages."</p>
<p>
  [41] In the same text, however, Brown also states at 1501: [W]hile the evidence 
  is admissible in aggravation of damages, no damages may be directly awarded 
  for any defamatory remarks that are not the subject-matter of the cause of action" 
  [emphasis added]. Similarly, in McElroy v. Cowper-Smith, [1967] S.C.R. 425 at 
  429, per Spence J. dissenting on other grounds, the following passage from Pearson 
  v. Lemaitre (1843), 5 Man. &amp; G. 700 at 719-20 is quoted with approval: </p>
<p class="indent">
  And this appears to us to be the correct rule, viz. that either party may, with 
  a view to the damages, give evidence to prove or disprove the existence of a 
  malicious motive in the mind of the publisher of defamatory matter; but that, 
  if the evidence given for the purpose, establishes another cause of action, 
  the jury should be cautioned against giving any damages in respect of it [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [42] In this case, no issue arises concerning the admissibility at trial of 
  evidence concerning the March and the August Statements. What is at issue is 
  whether the trial judge's assessment of damages properly ensured that no damages 
  were awarded for the March Statements and granted relief for only those damages 
  attributable to the August Statements. I am unable to conclude on the basis 
  of the trial judge's reasons that the damages assessment here satisfied those 
  requirements. </p>
<p>
  [43] In my view, read as a whole, the trial judge's reasons indicate that he 
  undertook a global assessment of damages for defamation concerning both the 
  March and the August Statements and that he did not determine the damages arising 
  solely from the August Statements. That approach to the assessment of damages 
  for defamation gave no meaningful effect to the expiry of the applicable limitation 
  period concerning the March Statements. </p>
<p>
  [44] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, in part, by setting aside the award 
  of damages for defamation. I agree with Professionals that it is appropriate 
  in this case for this court to fix the damages to which Murphy is entitled as 
  a result of the proven defamation occasioned by the August Statements. </p>
<p>
  [45] In that connection, Professionals submits that Murphy is entitled to nominal 
  damages only concerning the August Statements. Since Latini testified that he 
  did not repeat the August Statements and that he was alone with Morris when 
  they were made, and because there was no evidence that Murphy was aware of the 
  August Statements, Professionals contends that the presumption of damages arising 
  from the August Statements was rebutted. It argues that on this evidence, the 
  reputational damage that the trial judge found had been suffered by Murphy could 
  not have been caused by the August Statements. </p>
<p>
  [46] I agree that the evidence of damages arising from the August Statements 
  is weak. Nonetheless, several witnesses at trial indicated that the tarnishing 
  of Murphy's reputation continued to the date of the trial. As well, as I have 
  said, Murphy confirmed that he was still being questioned about the alleged 
  gun incident long after the utterance of the August Statements. Latini testified 
  that he was still being asked at the time of the trial whether he had "talked 
  to the madman lately". Although Latini also said that the August Statements 
  did not cause him to undertake further investigation of Murphy's alleged conduct, 
  he did not indicate that the August Statements had no effect on his view of 
  Murphy. </p>
<p>
  [47] I agree with Professionals that the evidence does not support an award 
  of special or aggravated damages with respect to the August Statements. However, 
  in my view, there is some evidence in this case to ground an award of general 
  damages. The August Statements were made to Murphy's employer. They cast serious 
  doubt upon Murphy's behaviour and integrity. The trial judge found that they 
  exacerbated the injuries previously caused to Murphy by the earlier, statute-barred 
  slander. Murphy's defamatory actions, for which Professionals is liable, were 
  motivated by malice. Proof of actual damage is not required. On the evidence, 
  the presumption of damages was not fully rebutted. Accordingly, Murphy is entitled 
  to be compensated for the wrong inflicted upon him by the August Statements. 
  In all of the circumstances, I conclude that an award of general damages in 
  the sum of $10,000 is appropriate in connection with the defamation occasioned 
  by the August Statements.</p>
<p>
  (2) The Ad Fund Claims</p>
<p>
  [48] At trial, Murphy argued that the terms of his employment contract with 
  Professionals required that his contributions to the Ad Fund be used only for 
  advertising, that RE/MAX Ontario owed him a fiduciary duty with respect to the 
  Ad Fund, and that his monthly contributions for advertising were held in trust 
  by RE/MAX Ontario. He further argued that the Ad Fund was mismanaged by the 
  expenditure of contributions on activities such as awards dinners and recruiting 
  in contravention of Directive 801. Murphy sought an accounting of all of the 
  contributions made to the Ad Fund by RE/MAX agents and the reimbursement of 
  his own contributions. </p>
<p>
  [49] In his reasons, the trial judge remarked that "RE/MAX", the organization, 
  kept relatively poor financial records as they related to RE/MAX agents. However, 
  in the end, he held that Murphy did not have status to claim an accounting of 
  all contributions to and expenditures from the Ad Fund. As I have said, Murphy 
  does not challenge that holding. </p>
<p>
  [50] The trial judge also rejected Murphy's claim for reimbursement of his own 
  contributions to the Ad Fund. In doing so, the trial judge concluded that, in 
  reality, this claim was de minimus, for two reasons. </p>
<p>
  [51] First, the trial judge held that any reimbursement claim concerning most 
  of Murphy's contributions to the Ad Fund was statute-barred. The reimbursement 
  claim was not advanced until August 1994. Accordingly, the claim for reimbursement 
  of contributions made prior to August 1988 was barred by virtue of the expiry 
  of a six year limitation period established under the Act. Murphy does not contest 
  that holding in these proceedings. In addition, as also held by the trial judge, 
  the value of the remainder of Murphy's contributions, that is, those contributions 
  made during the period August 1988 to September 1989, was minimal. The trial 
  judge commented: "[T]he only amount contributed which is not statute-barred 
  would be something less than $1,000." </p>
<p>
  [52] Second, Murphy's reimbursement claim concerned only those expenditures 
  from the Ad Fund that were alleged by him to be unrelated to advertising and 
  unauthorized by Directive 801. As the trial judge noted, when only these expenditures 
  were considered in the context of that part of Murphy's reimbursement claim 
  that was not statute-barred, something less than $1,000 was in issue. </p>
<p>
  [53] In view of these factors, the trial judge concluded that Murphy's reimbursement 
  claim was reduced from about $1,000 to a "relatively insignificant" 
  amount. He also concluded that Murphy had not demonstrated any improper use 
  of the monies in the Ad Fund. There was ample evidence before the trial judge 
  to support those conclusions. </p>
<p>
  [54] For these reasons, in my view, the trial judge's decision to dismiss Murphy's 
  claim for reimbursement of his contributions to the Ad Fund is unassailable. 
  </p>
<p>
  (3) The Assessment of Costs</p>
<p>
  [55] A trial judge has a broad discretion regarding the awarding of costs in 
  civil proceedings. Appellate courts are loathe to interfere with a trial judge's 
  exercise of discretion concerning costs save in very limited circumstances: 
  see Bell Canada v. Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 
  135 at 141-42 (C.A.); Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Matsqui Indian Band, [1995] 1 
  S.C.R. 3 at 32; and Mete v. Guardian Insurance Co. of Canada (1998), 165 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 457 at paras. 15-16 (Ont. C.A.). Accordingly, absent an error in principle, 
  an appellate court will not interfere with a trial judge's costs disposition 
  even if it concludes that it would have exercised discretion concerning costs 
  in a different way. </p>
<p>
  [56] In this case, it is useful to observe at the outset that the trial judge's 
  costs dispos-ition constituted neither a "Bullock" order, nor a "Sanderson" 
  order. These types of costs orders are described by M.M. Orkin in The Law of 
  Costs, 2d ed. (Aurora: Canada Law Book Inc., 2003) at 2-77 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where a plaintiff recovers judgment against one of several defendants and the 
  action is dismissed against the others, in the normal course the plaintiff will 
  be entitled to costs against the unsuccessful defendant, and the successful 
  defendant will be entitled to costs against the plaintiff. However, where the 
  allocation of responsibility between defendants is uncertain, usually because 
  of interwoven facts, it is often reasonable for a plaintiff to proceed through 
  trial in order to establish liability. In this situation the courts have devised 
  two alter-natives known respectively as a Bullock order and a Sander-son order. 
  Simply put, a Bullock order directs an unsuccess-ful defendant to reimburse 
  the plaintiff for the costs of the successful defendant; a Sanderson order directs 
  that the payment go directly to the successful defendant.</p>
<p>
  [57] Thus, under both a Bullock and a Sanderson order, a successful defendant 
  recovers its costs and the issue for determination by the court concerns which 
  party, as between the plaintiff and the unsuccessful defendant, should bear 
  responsibility for the payment of those costs. That is not this case. Here, 
  the successful defendant was denied its costs and the unsuccessful defendant 
  was obliged to pay the plaintiff's costs of proceeding both as against it and 
  as against the successful defendant. In my view, for the reasons that follow, 
  there is no basis upon which to interfere with this costs disposition.</p>
<p>
  (a) Denial of Costs to RE/MAX Ontario</p>
<p>
  [58] The trial judge rejected RE/MAX Ontario's claim for its costs of the action, 
  not-withstanding its success at trial, on three grounds. First, in his view, 
  both prior to and during the trial, RE/MAX Ontario and Professionals improperly 
  resisted their documentary production obligations relating to the Ad Fund. Second, 
  RE/MAX Ontario and Professionals were represented throughout the litigation 
  by the same legal counsel. Third, the interests of RE/MAX Ontario and Professionals 
  in the litigation were similar and interwoven such that they should not be entitled 
  to separate costs considerations. </p>
<p>
  [59] The general costs recovery rule, namely, that costs follow the event, supports 
  RE/MAX Ontario's claim for its costs of the action. However, this is not an 
  absolute rule; nor is success in an action the only relevant factor to be considered 
  in determining an appropriate and just costs disposition. </p>
<p>
  [60] The trial judge based his denial of costs to RE/MAX Ontario, in part, on 
  its conduct in the litigation. That is a relevant consideration in the decision 
  whether to award or deny costs and in deciding an appropriate quantum of costs 
  if they are to be awarded: see for example, rule 57.01(1)(e) of the Rules of 
  Civil Procedure. </p>
<p>
  [61] The trial judge concluded that RE/MAX Ontario and Professionals failed 
  to make timely disclosure of documents relevant to the determination of the 
  issues concerning the Ad Fund. In his ruling on costs, he said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  More importantly, however, is the fact that much of the pretrial proceedings 
  related to the "ad fund" issue. In fact, the efforts taken by the 
  defendants to resist producing docu-mentation relating to the use of the ad 
  fund continued even throughout the trial. It was not until late in the trial 
  that much of the evidence that could have been, and ought to have been produced 
  far earlier was eventually produced. The evi-dence in this regard was characterized 
  by plaintiff's counsel as an "ambush" by the defendant [RE/MAX] Ontario. 
  He points out that [RE/MAX] Ontario had steadfastly resisted making efforts 
  to obtain the material that the plaintiff was requesting in order to prosecute 
  his "ad fund" complaint [underlined emphasis in original; other emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [62] Although RE/MAX Ontario asserts that it was relieved from any obligation 
  to produce much of this documentation under various pre-trial court orders, 
  it does not dispute that a letter dated January 31, 2001 from RE/MAX International 
  to RE/MAX Ontario was not produced to Murphy or his counsel until six days before 
  trial. This letter dealt with the administration of the Ad Fund, the application 
  of Directive 801 to RE/MAX Ontario and the propriety of certain expenditures 
  from the Ad Fund, including expenditures to subsidize Ontario awards dinners 
  for agents. </p>
<p>
  [63] Thus, the January 31, 2001 letter was directly relevant to several of the 
  claims advanced by Murphy concerning the Ad Fund. Moreover, on its face, the 
  letter appeared to contradict a written statement made by RE/MAX International 
  in an earlier letter to Murphy dated November 23, 1994 in which the author of 
  the letter stated on behalf of RE/MAX International: "[W]e have no knowledge 
  or information regarding how RE/MAX Ontario expended its ad fund money." 
  For these reasons, the letter was poten-tially a key document at trial. </p>
<p>
  [64] The January 31, 2001 letter was tendered as an exhibit at trial by counsel 
  for RE/MAX Ontario and Professionals when he was cross-examining Murphy. Although 
  it was not tendered for the proof of the truth of its contents, it was relied 
  upon by RE/MAX Ontario and Professionals on the issue of Murphy's knowledge 
  of RE/MAX Interna-tional's position concerning expenditures from the Ad Fund. 
  The author of the letter was not called as a witness at trial. </p>
<p>
  [65] In his ruling on costs, the trial judge stated in connection with the January 
  31, 2001 letter: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is true that the "ad fund" issue turned out, in my judgment, to 
  be a "red herring". It is also true that as the plaintiff's counsel 
  argues in his factum: </p>
<p class="indent10">
  &#133;were it not for the defendants' campaign of attrition on the "ad 
  fund" issue, culminating in the ambush shortly before trial in the form 
  of the [January 31, 2001] letter, Mr. Murphy may have been able to reassess 
  his position many years ago.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">They both demonstrated resistance to producing material required 
  under the Rules of Practice.</p>
<p>
  [66] These comments weighed heavily in the trial judge's reasoning for his costs 
  disposition concerning both RE/MAX Ontario and Professionals.</p>
<p>
  [67] In connection with RE/MAX Ontario, it was clearly open to the trial judge 
  to conclude that the late disclosure of the information contained in the January 
  31, 2001 letter evidenced an unwillingness or failure by RE/MAX Ontario to disclose 
  information on a timely basis that may have clarified the issues in dispute 
  regarding the Ad Fund at an earlier stage of the litigation. </p>
<p>
  [68] In addition, the pre-trial history of this action is characterized by numerous 
  productions and refusals motions. The record indicates that Murphy repeatedly 
  attempted to obtain production of information and documents concerning the Ad 
  Fund issues from RE/MAX Ontario and, in some instances, from Professionals. 
  While I accept RE/MAX Ontario's assertion that it was relieved by some pre-trial 
  court orders from the obligation to produce many of the documents or information 
  sought by Murphy, several pre-trial orders required it to produce documents, 
  or to answer questions asked of it, concerning the Ad Fund. During the course 
  of the trial, RE/MAX Ontario and Professionals produced various working papers 
  of PriceWaterhouse through a witness from that firm. Murphy alleged, and in 
  my view the trial judge implicitly accepted, that these materials included at 
  least some documents concerning the Ad Fund that should have been produced prior 
  to trial. </p>
<p>
  [69] Thus, the facts found by the trial judge concerning RE/MAX Ontario's conduct 
  in the action support his decision to deny RE/MAX Ontario its costs of the litigation 
  notwithstanding its success at trial and the normal costs recovery rule. There 
  was evidence to support those factual findings. Consequently, I am not persuaded 
  that there is any basis for interfering with the trial judge's exercise of discretion 
  in denying costs to RE/MAX Ontario. As I will discuss next, I reach a similar 
  conclusion concerning the scope of the costs award made by the trial judge against 
  Professionals.</p>
<p>
  (b) Scope of the Costs Award Against Professionals</p>
<p>
  [70] Professionals argues that it is fundamentally unjust for it to be held 
  liable for Murphy's costs incurred in unsuccessfully suing RE/MAX Ontario. In 
  addition to his comments concerning Professionals' compliance with its documentary 
  production obli-gations, which I have earlier reproduced, in his costs ruling 
  the trial judge stated as follows regarding Professionals: </p>
<p class="indent"> The secondary issue, that is whether there should be a discount 
  in the plaintiff's costs against [Professionals], on the basis that the bulk 
  of the trial time (and for that matter a very large portion of the pre-trial 
  litigation [and] preparation), related to the "ad fund" issue, is more readily 
  disposed of. Even the defendants concede that a "distributive" approach to costs 
  is inappropriate and forms the basis of its claim of costs on behalf of RE/MAX 
  Ontario against the plaintiff.</p>
<p class="indent">Utilizing the same principle, I am satisfied that there was 
  sufficient overlapping of the interests and evidence of all of the defendants, 
  that not only should the plaintiff not be required to pay the costs of the "successful" 
  defendant RE/MAX Ontario, but he should not be deprived of his costs against 
  the unsuccessful defendants, [Professionals] and Morris. </p>
<p>
  [71] As well, earlier in his costs ruling, the trial judge observed: "[B]oth 
  companies were either owned or substantially controlled by the co-defendants 
  Alexander and Polzler. Mr. Polzler is Ms. Alexander's father. It was very much 
  in the interest of both corporate defendants to resist all aspects of the plaintiff's 
  claims. This could effectively be done through one solicitor. They should not 
  be entitled to two separate costs considerations." </p>
<p>
  [72] The trial judge appears to have regarded the proposition that Professionals 
  not be held liable for Murphy's costs of prosecuting his claims against RE/MAX 
  Ontario as an invitation to make a distributive costs order. Under that approach 
  to the allocation of costs, the major issues at trial are identified and the 
  party who is successful on each issue is awarded costs for the time and expense 
  attributable to that issue. In Armak Chemicals Ltd. v. Canadian National Railway 
  Co. (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused [1992] 1 
  S.C.R. vi, this court generally rejected the appropriateness of distributive 
  cost orders in litigation involving multiple issues where success is divided, 
  on the basis that such orders are inconsistent with the rules of procedure concerning 
  offers to settle. Although the possibility of a distributive costs order is 
  not completely foreclosed in a proper case, such an order will be appropriate 
  only in rare circumstances, if at all: Skye v. Matthews, [1996] O.J. No. 44 
  at paras. 15 and 19 (C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [73] In my view, the allocation of costs in this case is not controlled by the 
  principles applicable to distributive costs orders. The relevant costs issue 
  here does not concern multiple issues between the same parties, where success 
  is divided. Rather, it involves the costs associated with unsuccessfully prosecuting 
  a cause of action against one defendant in the same action in which separate 
  and distinct causes of action are successfully prosecuted against another defendant. 
  </p>
<p>
  [74] Nonetheless, on the facts here, I am not persuaded that the trial judge's 
  costs disposition against Professionals was a wrongful exercise of discretion.</p>
<p>
  [75] Murphy's claims concerning the Ad Fund, as framed by him in his amended, 
  amended statement of claim, implicated both RE/MAX Ontario and Professionals. 
  For example, he alleged that Professionals breached its written employment contract 
  with him in respect of the Ad Fund. Murphy's pleading, therefore, triggered 
  Professionals' production obligations under the Rules of Civil Procedure concerning 
  the Ad Fund. In addition, as I have previously indicated, several of the pre-trial 
  productions motions concerned Professionals' obligations in respect of both 
  the Ad Fund and other issues. The trial judge concluded on the evidence, as 
  he was entitled to do, that Professionals did not satisfy its production obligations 
  in a timely fashion. Accordingly, Professionals' own conduct in the litigation 
  grounded the costs award made against it.</p>
<p>
  [76] As well, I do not agree with Professionals' assertion that the trial judge 
  erred in taking into account the relationship between the principals of Professionals 
  and RE/MAX Ontario when arriving at his costs disposition. The interests of 
  both companies were similar in the litigation at least with respect to the Ad 
  Fund. They co-operated in their defences to Murphy's claims including, in particular, 
  in their response to the Ad Fund issues, and they were represented throughout 
  the litigation by the same counsel. These factors are legitimate considerations 
  in assessing the scope of the costs award to be made against Professionals.</p>
<p>
  [77] It is important to remember that this trial lasted 11 days and that in 
  his costs ruling, the trial judge expressly indicated that Murphy's claims concerning 
  the Ad Fund occupied more than 50% of the time expended at trial and "a 
  very large portion of the pre-trial litigation [and] preparation". Both 
  the length of the trial and the costs of the litigation, therefore, were driven 
  in significant measure by the Ad Fund issues - the very issues in respect of 
  which the trial judge held that both Professionals and RE/MAX Ontario had not 
  fully met their obligations under the Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>
  [78] I conclude, therefore, that there is no basis upon which to interfere with 
  the trial judge's discretionary decision to hold Professionals responsible for 
  Murphy's litigation costs incurred in prosecuting his claims against RE/MAX 
  Ontario. </p>
<p>
  IV. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [79] For the reasons given, I would allow the appeal, in part, by setting aside 
  paragraph one of the trial judgment and substituting in its stead an order requiring 
  Professionals to pay Murphy the total sum of $25,000 for damages, comprised 
  of $15,000 on account of the damages awarded by the trial judge for Murphy's 
  wrongful dismissal and the additional sum of $10,000 as damages for defamation 
  occasioned by the August State-ments. I would also set aside paragraph two of 
  the trial judgment, which concerns pre-judgment interest, and substitute in 
  its stead an order directing that Professionals pay Murphy pre-judgment interest 
  calculated in accordance with the trial judge's pre-judgment interest ruling, 
  varied as necessary to conform with these reasons. Finally, I would grant leave 
  to appeal costs and dismiss the balance of the appeal and the cross appeal.</p>
<p>
  [80] Professionals sought leave of this court to make further submissions on 
  other aspects of the costs of the trial if it was successful on its challenge 
  of the trial judge's assessment of damages for defamation. As I have concluded 
  that the appeal should be allowed on the issue of the damages assessment, Professionals, 
  if so advised, may deliver its additional written submissions concerning the 
  costs of the trial to the Registrar of this court within 10 days from the date 
  hereof. Murphy shall deliver his written responding submissions, if any, to 
  the Registrar within 10 days from the date of his receipt of Professionals' 
  submissions. </p>
<p>
  [81] Viewed as a whole, success in these proceedings has been divided. Accordingly, 
  this is not an appropriate case for an award of costs with respect to the appeal 
  or the cross-appeal. </p>
