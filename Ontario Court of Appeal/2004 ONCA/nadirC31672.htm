<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The applicant/appellant was convicted of making harassing telephone calls 
  contrary to s. 372(3) of the Criminal Code. His conviction appeal to the Superior 
  Court was dismissed. He now seeks leave to appeal to this court. This court 
  can consider only questions of law.</p>
<p>
  [2] There are four grounds of appeal.</p>
<p>The Limitation Period</p>
<p>
  [3] The offence of making harassing phone calls contrary to s. 372(3) is by 
  its very nature a continuing one that involves a course of conduct. On the trial 
  judge's finding of fact, the harassing course of conduct engaged in by the applicant/appellant 
  began more than six months prior to the laying of the information, but continued 
  through dates well within six months of the laying of the information. Section 
  786(2) does not bar a prosecution for a course of events which begins prior 
  to six months before the laying of the information, but is ongoing during the 
  six months prior to the laying of the information. As long as the Crown could 
  prove that the harassing course of conduct was ongoing in the six months prior 
  to the laying of the information, s. 686(2) did not require that the time frame 
  described in the information be limited to the six months prior to the charge 
  and there was no need to amend this information.</p>
<p>The Interpretation of Section 372(3)</p>
<p>
  [4] Counsel for the applicant/appellant next argued that the number of telephone 
  calls made by the applicant/appellant, particularly the limited number which 
  were found to be for the sole purpose of harassing the recipients, could not 
  constitute "repeated telephone calls" for the purposes of s. 372(3). 
  Counsel acknowledged that the determination of whether the conduct amounted 
  to "repeated telephone calls" was a factual one. As long as there 
  was some evidence from which the trial judge could conclude that the calls were 
  "repeated", his finding does not raise a question of law and cannot 
  be reviewed in this court. There was some evidence that the applicant/appellant 
  made several calls. </p>
<p>
  [5] The third ground of appeal rests on the contention that the harassing phone 
  calls had to be actually received by the persons whom the maker of the telephone 
  calls intended to harass. Assuming without deciding that this is a proper interpretation 
  of s. 372(3), the trial judge made the finding that some of the calls were directed 
  specifically at one or more of the individuals named in the information and 
  others were directed at the individuals collectively. There was ample evidence 
  to support this finding. Given the entirety of the circumstances, there was 
  also evidence to support his conclusion that the applicant/appellant must have 
  known that his harassing calls would come to the attention of the three individuals 
  described in the information. This finding of fact is not open to challenge 
  on this appeal.</p>
<p>The Lawful Excuse Defence</p>
<p>
  [6] The final ground of appeal, and apparently the only ground argued before 
  the Summary Conviction Appeal Court, arises out of the trial judge's finding 
  that the defence of lawful excuse referred to in s. 372(3) could not apply in 
  the circumstances of this case. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge concluded 
  that the trial judge was wrong in law in his analysis of the section, but went 
  on to hold that the error caused no substantial wrong as there was no evidence 
  of lawful excuse in respect of at least some of the harassing phone calls made 
  by the applicant/appellant. We see the difference between the trial judge and 
  Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge as essentially one of semantics. The trial 
  judge made an explicit finding of fact that several of the calls were made for 
  the sole purpose of harassing the recipients. He said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; A large number of calls and messages, which based upon their content, 
  the tone, the timing and history, could only be viewed by the court, or anyone, 
  as being for the sole purpose of harassing or indeed threatening the complainants.</p>
<p>
  [7] We were referred to no evidence which could provide any support for a lawful 
  excuse defence in respect of calls made exclusively for the purpose of harassing 
  the recipients. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a situation in which telephone 
  calls made exclusively for the purpose of harassment could be sheltered under 
  a lawful excuse defence. </p>
<p>
  [8] Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed.</p>
