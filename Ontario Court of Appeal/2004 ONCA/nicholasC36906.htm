<p>On appeal from acquittals entered by Justice Peter G. Jarvis of the Superior 
  Court of Justice on February 22, 2001, and March 23, 2001, and from the conviction 
  entered on March 23, 2001.</p>
<p>
  ABELLA J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] In the summer of 1999, the police set up a Task Force to investigate a series 
  of break and enters and sexual assaults believed to be committed by the "Scarborough 
  Bedroom Rapist". As a result of that investigation, Eli Stewart Nicholas 
  was arrested on September 25, 1999.</p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [2] The charges against Mr. Nicholas arose out of three incidents of an intruder 
  breaking into three different homes in Scarborough and physically assaulting, 
  and, in two of the cases, sexually assaulting the female occupants. The first 
  incident, involving A.U., occurred on June 2, 1999. The second incident, involving 
  G.W., occurred on August 21, 1999. The third incident, involving F.G., occurred 
  on September 13, 1999.</p>
<p>
  [3] Mr. Nicholas was convicted of sexual assault and break and enter in connection 
  with the events on September 13, 1999 relating to F.G. He appeals from these 
  convictions on the basis that the trial judge erred in admitting DNA evidence 
  taken while he was detained and in violation of his s. 10 (b) Charter rights. 
  The Crown concedes that if Mr. Nicholas was detained when he gave his DNA sample, 
  his rights were violated. </p>
<p>
  [4] Mr. Nicholas was acquitted of the charges relating to G.W. The Crown brought 
  an application to admit out-of-court statements made by G.W. This application 
  was dismissed. The Crown appeals from that acquittal on the basis that the trial 
  judge erred in refusing to admit the evidence as an exception to the hearsay 
  rule. </p>
<p>
  [5] Mr. Nicholas was also acquitted of the charges relating to A.U. During the 
  proceedings, the Crown brought an application to admit similar fact evidence 
  from the F.G. incident for the purpose of identifying the accused as the perpetrator 
  of the A.U. incident. The trial judge dismissed the application. The Crown appeals 
  from the acquittal on the basis that the trial judge erred in refusing to admit 
  the similar fact evidence.</p>
<p>
  Investigation</p>
<p>
  [6] The Task Force received hundreds of tips. Based on them, the police identified 
  between one and two hundred "persons of interest". At trial, the distinction 
  between a person of interest and a suspect was explained as being that a person 
  of interest has no incriminating evidence linking him or her to the offence, 
  whereas a suspect does. </p>
<p>
  [7] As part of the investigation, persons of interest were asked to provide 
  a buccal swab for a DNA analysis. If they agreed to do so, they were asked to 
  sign a consent form. At the time the consent DNA samples were obtained, the 
  police did not have any suspects.</p>
<p>
  [8] People who refused to consent were placed under surveillance for the purposes 
  of obtaining a discard sample. Two officers testified at trial that out of seven 
  individuals who refused, discard samples were subsequently obtained from four 
  of them. No follow-up was conducted on the other three individuals. </p>
<p>
  [9] Mr. Nicholas, who was nineteen years old, was first identified as a person 
  of interest on September 20, 1999 as a result of a Crime Stoppers tip. At 12:47 
  p.m. on September 21, 1999, Cst. Catalano went to Mr. Nicholas's home, where 
  his mother indicated that he was at the library but had a curfew. The officer 
  left his card and asked that Mr. Nicholas call him and that he would return 
  to see him. </p>
<p>
  [10] On September 22, Cst. Catalano confirmed that Mr. Nicholas was on a recognizance 
  with a curfew of 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Since Cst. Catalano's shift ended at 
  4:00 p.m., two other police officers, D/Cst. Tanel and D/Cst. Dyck, attended 
  at Mr. Nicholas's home at 10:10 p.m. A man named Peter Powell answered the door, 
  invited the officers in, and directed the officers upstairs to Mr. Nicholas' 
  room. Testimony given by the officers indicated that Mr. Powell, whose relationship 
  with Mr. Nicholas was unclear from the evidence, appeared very animated and 
  seemed to be angry with Mr. Nicholas.</p>
<p>
  [11] When the officers arrived upstairs, Mr. Nicholas was coming out of the 
  bathroom and was wearing a towel. After identifying themselves with their badges, 
  the officers informed him that they were investigating a series of sexual assaults 
  and break and enters in the Scarborough area. They told him his name had come 
  up as a person of interest and that they would like to speak to him. Mr. Nicholas 
  replied "sure, no problem" and asked if he could get dressed first. 
  When he went to get dressed, the officers waited outside on the landing. Since 
  the light in Mr. Nicholas' bedroom was not working, D/Cst. Dyck suggested that 
  they go to the kitchen to talk.</p>
<p>
  [12] When they arrived in the kitchen, Mr Powell could be heard talking to a 
  friend in the other room so the officers suggested he move to the basement. 
  D/Cst. Dyck again explained to Mr. Nicholas that they were investigating a series 
  of sexual assaults and that he was a person of interest they wanted to speak 
  to. D/Cst. Dyck read the consent form to him and Mr. Nicholas agreed to provide 
  a buccal swab. D/Cst. Dyck then turned the audiotape on, read the consent form 
  again, and asked Mr. Nicholas if he understood it. Mr. Nicholas answered "yes". 
  </p>
<p>
  [13] The key portion of the audiotape transcript reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Dyck: I'm just gonna read something to you here. It's a consent 
  form, and-ah I'm just gonna read this. Toronto Police Service is investigating 
  a series of break and enters which have occurred between the twenty-third of 
  June and twenty-first of August Nineteen-ninety-nine, inclusive. During the 
  course of these break and enters female persons have been subjected to either 
  physical or sexual assault. We are seeking permission from you to obtain bodily 
  samples including blood or saliva for scientific testing, including DNA analysis. 
  The samples obtained from you will be scienti-fically tested and analysed and 
  compared with evidence obtained from the other crime scenes. The purpose of 
  this analysis and comparison is to enable investigators to attempt to positively 
  identify the person responsible for the break and enters, sexual assaults and 
  to also enable the investigators to eliminate the persons as possible suspects. 
  You understand that so far Sir?</p>
<p class="indent">Background Noise: (Unintelligible)</p>
<p class="indent">Nicholas: Yes</p>
<p class="indent">Dyck: You are not required to give us these samples. You may 
  refuse to provide these samples. If you agree to provide samples for analysis, 
  the results of the analysis may be used against you in criminal proceedings. 
  You may wish to discuss this request with anybody including a lawyer and you 
  are free to do so now. Do you understand what I've just read to you sir?"</p>
<p class="indent">Nicholas: Yes Sir.</p>
<p class="indent">Dyck: Do you have any questions?</p>
<p class="indent">Nicholas: No.</p>
<p>
  [14] Mr. Nicholas's mother, who had come into the kitchen at some point during 
  the interview, then asked the police "[S]houldn't he have a lawyer?" 
  The officers replied that it was "up to him" and told her that Mr. 
  Nicholas had stated that he understood his opportunity to speak "to a lawyer 
  or anyone else for that matter". </p>
<p>
  [15] Mr. Nicholas then signed the form, swabbed the inside of his mouth, and 
  handed the swabs to the officers. The officers left his house at approximately 
  10:32 p.m. </p>
<p>
  [16] Mr. Nicholas's swabs were forwarded to the lab along with consent samples 
  from other persons of interest, and the Task Force continued its investigation. 
  </p>
<p>
  [17] On September 25, 1999, the police learned that the DNA samples they had 
  obtained from Mr. Nicholas matched DNA found at the crime scene involving G.W. 
  on August 21, and F.G. on September 13, 1999. </p>
<p>
  [18] That same day, a search warrant was executed at Mr. Nicholas's residence 
  and a loaded handgun was found in his bedroom closet. He was arrested and charged 
  with thirteen counts arising from the three incidents, including sexual assault, 
  break and enter and weapons related charges.</p>
<p>
  [19] Afterwards, the police realized that the consent form only referred to 
  incidents between June 23 and August 21. This excluded the September 13 incident 
  involving F.G. To rectify this omission, the police seized a blood sample from 
  Mr. Nicholas, pursuant to a warrant executed under s. 486.05 of the Criminal 
  Code. The DNA profile obtained from the blood sample was matched to the DNA 
  profile obtained from the G.W. and F. G. crime scenes. </p>
<p>
  THE CONVICTION APPEAL: The "F.G." Incident: September 13, 1999</p>
<p>
  [20] F.G. was seventy-five years old and lived with her physically disabled 
  husband. Her two-storey home was close to two parks. She awoke on September 
  13, 1999, to find a male lying on top of her. The male fled after she began 
  to yell and struggle. She discovered that twenty dollars was missing from her 
  wallet and that an orange juice carton had been removed from the refrigerator 
  and left in her bedroom. DNA was taken from the carton. It matched Mr. Nicholas's 
  DNA. </p>
<p>
  The DNA Sample</p>
<p>
  [21] At trial, counsel for Mr. Nicholas argued that Mr. Nicholas was detained 
  when the police came to his home. Consequently, since the Crown acknowledged 
  that Mr. Nicholas was not properly informed of his right to counsel as required 
  by s. 10(b) of the Charter, the DNA sample was improperly admitted. His alternative 
  argument was that Mr. Nicholas did not provide a voluntary and informed consent 
  to the taking of the sample, and in the absence of such consent, the seizure 
  was unreasonable and a violation of s. 8 of the Charter.</p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge held a voir dire to examine the circumstances surrounding 
  the taking of the sample. Mr. Nicholas did not testify at the voir dire. </p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge observed that Mr. Nicholas was allowed to enter his bedroom 
  without supervision or control and that the police never assumed any physical 
  control over his actions. He also found that the only police directions were 
  about where their conversation with Mr. Nicholas would take place since his 
  bedroom was unavailable. He concluded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In fact, the actions of the police indicate a sensitivity to Mr. Nicholas' privacy 
  interests, as did their efforts to clear the other occupants of the main floor 
  in advance of the interview. At some point Mr. Nicholas' mother appeared and 
  her presence was countenanced. All of this evidence satisfies me that there 
  was no demand or direction implicit or explicit in the actions of the police 
  which had any bearing on the signing of the consent by Mr. Nicholas [emphasis 
  added]</p>
<p>
  [24] The trial judge also examined whether the consent provided by the accused 
  was voluntary and informed.</p>
<p>
  [25] Dr. Nathan Pollock testified at the voir dire on behalf of the defence. 
  His opinion was that there was a possibility that Mr. Nicholas' personality 
  profile might have affected his ability to give an informed consent to the request 
  for the DNA. Dr. Pollock based his opinion that Mr. Nicholas did not understand 
  the consequences of giving a DNA sample on some rap lyrics written by Mr. Nicholas 
  which contained the words, "DNA, ain't gonna solve Ya Murda". The 
  trial judge rejected Dr. Pollock's suggestion. </p>
<p>
  [26] Applying the test in R. v. Borden (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 404 (S.C.C.), 
  and after considering the evidence of intelligence test results, the testimony 
  from Dr. Pollock, and audio and videotapes, the trial judge concluded that the 
  accused had sufficient understanding to give a voluntary and informed consent.</p>
<p>
  [27] Most significantly, he relied on the fact that Mr. Nicholas' failure to 
  testify at the voir dire, resulted in an absence of evidence of compulsion. 
  The trial judge noted that Mr. Nicholas: </p>
<p class="indent"> [d]id not testify in the voir dire and there is no direct evidence 
  of his subjective state of mind other than the external objective evidence which 
  shows that he knew and understood what he was doing and saying. There was evidence 
  from Dr. Pollock bearing on this, which I deal with below. The only indication 
  from Mr. Nicholas regarding his consent or otherwise, consist of his utterances 
  immediately after his arrest and his statements during his interview on September 
  27, 1999, in which he stated several times that he had voluntarily consented 
  to the sample.</p>
<p class="indent">It was argued with some force on Mr. Nicholas's behalf that 
  the very fact that he had consented made no sense and could only be evidence 
  of a complete failure to understand the consequences of what he was doing. With 
  the greatest respect, human actions are not always logical, nor are they always 
  consistent with self-interest. I am convinced on all the evidence that Mr. Nicholas 
  did not feel compelled to co-operate and acted voluntarily.</p>
<p>
  [28] However, he also concluded that since the dates on the written consent 
  form were limited to June 23 and August 21, 1999, Mr. Nicholas's s. 8 Charter 
  right was breached by the use of the DNA sample in connection with the offences 
  that took place on September 13, 1999.</p>
<p>
  [29] The trial judge accordingly engaged in a s. 24 (2) analysis, applying the 
  three-stage inquiry in R. v. Collins (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.): the 
  fairness of the trial; the seriousness of the violation; and the effect of the 
  exclusion on the administration of justice. </p>
<p>
  [30] Relying on Cory J.'s comments in R. v. Stillman (1996), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 
  321 (S.C.C.) at p. 360, the trial judge concluded that the Crown had established, 
  on a balance of probabilities, that alternative non-conscriptive means, like 
  discard samples, were available and that the police would have availed themselves 
  of them, as they had during the course of their investigation when other people 
  refused to consent to providing a buccal swab. </p>
<p>
  [31] The trial judge also considered the manner in which the search was conducted; 
  the bona fides of the investigators; the duration and intensity of the Charter 
  violation; and the regard for the suspect's rights demonstrated by the officers. 
  He observed that the written consent was detailed, informative, and, although 
  missing the September 13th date, the date was mentioned orally to the accused 
  during the meeting, albeit after he had signed the consent. He found that no 
  force was used and that there was no intention on the part of the police to 
  mislead. </p>
<p>
  [32] The breach, therefore, was not a serious one. </p>
<p>
  [33] Citing Cory J.'s conclusion in R. v. Belnavis (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 405 
  at 426 (S.C.C.), that evidence necessary to substantiate a serious charge should 
  not be excluded where the breach is trivial, inadvertent or technical, the trial 
  judge concluded that the exclusion of the evidence based on the missing date 
  in the consent form, would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
  </p>
<p>
  [34] The DNA evidence was therefore admitted in connection with the incidents 
  involving F.G. and G.W. DNA was not obtained from the A.U. crime scene. Mr. 
  Nicholas was convicted of break and enter and sexual assault in relation to 
  the F.G. counts, as well as possession of a loaded prohibited weapon. </p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [35] The primary issue is whether Mr. Nicholas, at the time he provided his 
  DNA sample, was detained. The Crown conceded that if Mr. Nicholas was detained, 
  his s. 10(b) Charter right to counsel was violated. The appellant acknowledges 
  that the only aspect of detention which arises on this conviction appeal is 
  whether Mr. Nicholas was "psychologically detained" and under a psychological 
  compulsion to comply with the police request. If he was not detained, the appellant 
  argues that he did not give a valid and informed consent to providing a sample 
  and therefore his s. 8 Charter right was violated.</p>
<p>
  [36] Le Dain J. observed in R. v. Therens (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) 
  at 505 that, </p>
<p class="indent"> [D]etention may be effected without the application or threat 
  of application of physical restraint if the person concerned submits or acquiesces 
  in the deprivation of liberty and reasonably believes that the choice to do 
  otherwise does not exist.</p>
<p>
  See also R. v. Thomsen (1988), 40 C.C.C. 3d 411 (S.C.C.) at p. 417.</p>
<p>
  [37] In R. v. Bazinet (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 273 (Ont. C.A.) Tarnopolsky J.A. 
  emphazised at p. 283 that Le Dain J.'s extension of detention to instances of 
  psychological detention is predicated upon "two requirements: (1) a 'demand 
  or direction', in response to which (2) 'the person concerned submits or acquiesces 
  in the deprivation of liberty and reasonably believes that the choice to do 
  otherwise does not exist'". </p>
<p>
  [38] In R. v. Moran, (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.) at pp. 258 - 259 
  Martin J.A. set out a non-exhaustive list of factors to be considered when determining 
  whether an accused has been psychologically detained: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. the precise language used by the police officer in requesting 
  the person who subsequently becomes an accused to come to the police station, 
  and whether the accused was given a choice or expressed a preference that the 
  interview be conducted at the police station, rather than at his or her home;</p>
<p class="indent">2. whether the accused was escorted to the police station or 
  came himself or herself in response to a police request;</p>
<p class="indent">3. whether the accused left at the conclusion of the interview 
  or whether he or she was arrested;</p>
<p class="indent">4. the stage of the investigation, that is, whether the questioning 
  was part of the general investigation of a crime or possible crime or whether 
  the police had already decided that a crime had been committed and that the 
  accused was the perpetrator or involved in its commission and the questioning 
  was conducted for the purpose of obtaining incriminating statements from the 
  accused;</p>
<p class="indent">5. whether the police had reasonable and probable grounds to 
  believe that the accused had committed the crime being investigated;</p>
<p class="indent">6. the nature of the questions: whether they were questions 
  of a general nature designed to obtain information or whether the accused was 
  confronted with evidence pointing to his or her guilt;</p>
<p class="indent">7. the subjective belief by an accused that he or she is detained, 
  although relevant, is not decisive, because the issue is whether he or she reasonably 
  believed that he or she was detained. Personal circumstances relating to the 
  accused, such as low intelligence, emotional disturbance, youth and lack of 
  sophistication are circumstances to be considered in determining whether he 
  had a subjective belief that he was detained [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [39] These factors were applied by the trial judge and he concluded, properly 
  in my view, that several facts indicate that Mr. Nicholas was not detained. 
  </p>
<p>
  [40] In these circumstances, where the trial judge made findings manifestly 
  endorsing the propriety of the police conduct in the circumstances, it was important 
  to have evidence from Mr. Nicholas as to his state of mind when he signed the 
  consent form (see R. v. Caputo (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.)). As has 
  been previously pointed out, Mr. Nicholas gave no evidence on the voir dire.</p>
<p>
  [41] Steel J.A. in R. v. H. (C.R.) (2003), 174 C.C.C. (3d) 67 (Man. C.A.) at 
  paras. 45-6, discussed the importance of evidence of compulsion from an accused 
  for purposes of determining whether he or she was detained as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In most of the cases where a detention has been found, evidence of compulsion 
  arises from the testimony of the accused on the voir dire. Although not conclusive, 
  the testimony of the accused is often crucial to the question of whether there 
  was a reasonable belief that a compulsion to reply was present&#133;I am not 
  suggesting that there can never be a finding of detention in the absence of 
  testimony from the accused, but such a determination would require stronger 
  facts than exist in this case. The court must still have evidence from which 
  it can infer that the circumstances were such that the accused could reasonably 
  have concluded that his freedom had been restrained. (See also R. v. Bazinet 
  (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 273 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Esposito (1985), 49 C.R. (3d) 
  193 (Ont. C.A.)). </p>
<p>
  [42] There is no evidence of any kind in this case indicating that Mr. Nicholas 
  felt psychologically compelled to speak to the police or to provide a sample. 
  D/Cst. Dyck testified that the police had not made any demand of Mr. Nicholas, 
  nor had they ordered him to do anything, and Mr. Nicholas did not express any 
  concern or confusion either before sitting down at the kitchen table or after 
  having the consent form read to him.</p>
<p>
  [43] While it was undoubtedly disconcerting to Mr. Nicholas, dressed in a towel, 
  to find the police waiting for him outside his bathroom door, this alone is 
  an insufficient fact to ground a finding of detention given what happened next. 
  He was permitted to change, and while it is true that the police waited for 
  him outside his bedroom while he got dressed, the only direction they gave him 
  was that they speak in the kitchen because the light in his bedroom was not 
  working. </p>
<p>
  [44] The trial judge found that the suggestion by the police that they move 
  to the kitchen was not a demand or direction, and that the police were polite 
  and non-threatening to Mr. Nicholas. The consent form, which was read twice 
  to Mr. Nicholas, clearly stated that he could refuse to provide the sample. 
  Mr. Nicholas was not arrested at the end of the interview and the police continued 
  their investigation. The police were conducting the consent DNA sampling procedure 
  with other residents and had over one hundred persons of interest.</p>
<p>
  [45] In view of the trial judge's findings and in view of the absence of any 
  evidence of psychological compulsion, I find no basis for disturbing the trial 
  judge's finding that Mr. Nicholas was not detained.</p>
<p>
  [46] The trial judge also found that Mr. Nicholas provided a voluntary and informed 
  consent to the DNA sample. I see no basis for disturbing this finding. </p>
<p>
  [47] This Court in R. v. Blackstock, [1997] O.J. No. 3597 (C.A.) at para. 5 
  held that the Crown "bears the burden of proving an effective consent to 
  the taking of such samples and in many cases, will fail to meet that burden 
  where the police have not expressly told a person that he or she has a right 
  to refuse". </p>
<p>
  [48] In R. v. Wills (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 529 (Ont. C.A.), Doherty J.A. listed 
  six factors at p. 546 which the Crown must establish on the balance of probabilities 
  for a finding that an individual waived his or her right to be secure against 
  an unreasonable seizure: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) there was a consent, express or implied;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the giver of the consent had the authority to give the 
  consent in question;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the consent was voluntary in the sense that that word 
  is used in Goldman, [1980 1 S.C.R. 976] supra, and was not the product of police 
  oppression, coercion or other external conduct which negated the freedom to 
  choose whether or not to allow the police to pursue the course of conduct requested;</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) the giver of the consent was aware of the nature of the 
  police conduct to which he or she was being asked to consent;</p>
<p class="indent">(v) the giver of the consent was aware of his or her right to 
  refuse to permit the police to engage in the conduct requested, and</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) the giver of the consent was aware of the potential consequences 
  of giving the consent.</p>
<p>
  [49] The arguments of defence counsel relate primarily to the last three factors. 
  </p>
<p>
  [50] The application of the factors in Wills to this case demonstrates that 
  the Crown has established that Mr. Nicholas consented to the seizure of his 
  DNA, at least in relation to the A.U. and G.W. incidents. The police informed 
  Mr. Nicholas twice that they wanted to speak to him about a series of break-ins 
  and sexual assaults. Nicholas was informed that the police were investigating 
  a series of assaults, that he was a person of interest, that the sample would 
  be scientifically analysed, and that it would be compared with evidence obtained 
  from the crime scenes. The police explicitly told Mr. Nicholas that this comparison 
  was to enable the police to identify the person responsible for the crimes and 
  that the DNA sample could be used in criminal proceedings against him. The consent 
  form stated that the police were seeking permission, and that Mr. Nicholas did 
  not have to provide the sample. </p>
<p>
  [51] The trial judge found, however, that the use of the sample in the investigation 
  of the September 13, 1999 assault against F.G. breached Mr. Nicholas's Charter 
  right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure because the consent 
  form did not refer specifically to that date. The appellant submits that he 
  erred in failing to exclude the evidence under s. 24(2). </p>
<p>
  [52] The trial judge found the police conduct to be, on the whole, beyond reproach. 
  He found the violation not to be a serious one. Moreover, the Crown's evidence 
  was that the police had already successfully obtained discard samples from other 
  individuals who had refused to provide a sample, and planned to obtain discard 
  samples had Mr. Nicholas refused. This formed the basis for the trial judge's 
  conclusion that the evidence was otherwise discoverable. </p>
<p>
  [53] The trial judge conducted a thorough and well-reasoned s. 24(2) analysis 
  and I see no basis for interfering with his conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [54] In conclusion, I would dismiss Mr. Nicholas's appeal from the convictions.</p>
<p>
  THE ACQUITTALS</p>
<p>
  (i) Similar Fact Evidence: The "A.U." Incident, June 2, 1999</p>
<p>
  [55] During the early morning hours of June 2, 1999, sixty-eight year old A.U. 
  awoke to find an intruder holding a pillow over her face. She began to struggle 
  and the intruder fled the residence. She discovered that twenty-five dollars 
  had been stolen and that an orange juice carton had been taken from the refrigerator, 
  partially consumed, and left in a spare bedroom. The container was not tested 
  for DNA. </p>
<p>
  [56] A.U. lived with her physically and mentally disabled husband. They both 
  slept in the upper level of their home, which bordered on a park. </p>
<p>
  [57] A.U. was unable to identify her attacker and there was no DNA evidence 
  obtained from her home. The Crown sought to adduce evidence of the offences 
  on September 13, 1999 involving F.G. as similar fact evidence relevant to the 
  identity of A.U.'s attacker. Mr. Nicholas's DNA had been found on the orange 
  juice container in F.G.'s home. </p>
<p>
  [58] The Crown argued that there were both unique trademarks and sufficient 
  similarities between the F.G. and A.U. incidents to render objectively improbable 
  the likelihood that two different perpetrators committed the offences. </p>
<p>
  [59] The trial judge excluded the similar fact evidence on the basis that none 
  of it was sufficiently unique to satisfy the requirements in R. v. Arp (1998), 
  129 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) and found that its probative value was insufficient 
  to outweigh its prejudicial effect. </p>
<p>
  [60] He first considered whether there was a unique signature or trade mark 
  and concluded that the: </p>
<p class="indent"> [o]nly 'unique' factor&#133;was that in each case the perpetrator 
  took a container of orange juice from each complainant's refrigerator and apparently 
  consumed part or all of which as he proceeded through each house. I take judicial 
  notice of the fact that orange juice is probably to be found in the vast majority 
  of kitchen refrigerators in Canada&#133;I do not consider the consumption of 
  a beverage from a victim's refrigerator by a perpetrator to be sufficiently 
  unique to satisfy the requirements in Arp.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Of more interest and difficulty is whether the other similarities 
  in these events are such that coincidence is an objective improbability.</p>
<p class="indent">Let me say at first that many of the details of the evidence 
  are similar and no doubt have some probative value. I am not, however, convinced 
  that their probative value comes close to outweighing their prejudicial effect. 
  The most obvious simi-larities are the following: </p>
<p class="indent">(a) the age of the each victim;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) each lived with a disabled husband;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) each offence occurred during the early hours of the morning;</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the perpetrator fled at the first sign of resistance;</p>
<p class="indent">(e) in each case the perpetrator was in the victim's bedroom 
  when discovered, in one case lying atop of the victim, and in the other standing 
  beside her bed. In both cases an attempt was made to cover the face of the victim.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">In my view, none of the above factors are sufficiently unique, 
  either alone or cumulatively to satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that 
  the same person necessarily committed these acts. In other words, I consider 
  the probative value of the proposed evidence to be slight and its prejudicial 
  effect likely to be correspondingly high. Assuming the [F.G.] DNA evidence were 
  admitted, the proposed evidence would make a conviction by the jury on the [A.U.] 
  counts overwhelmingly likely, even with the most careful instructions from me.</p>
<p>
  [61] The trial judge concluded that the evidence fell short of meeting that 
  threshold. Having excluded the similar fact evidence, Mr. Nicholas was acquitted 
  of the A.U. incident.</p>
<p>
  [62] The Crown argues that the trial judge erred in two ways. First, in concluding 
  that the consumption of orange juice was not a unique trademark, and by focusing 
  on the uniqueness of the similarities when assessing their probative value. 
  Second, by relying solely on the increased chance of conviction when determining 
  the prejudicial effect of admitting the evidence. </p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [63] I am mindful that a trial judge's exercise of discretion regarding the 
  admissibility of similar fact evidence is entitled to a high level of deference: 
  R. v. Arp, at para. 42; R. v. Harvey (2001), 57 O.R. (3d) 296 (C.A.), affd (2002), 
  169 C.C.C. (3d) 576 (S.C.C.) at para. 50. </p>
<p>
  [64] Applying Arp, the trial judge took a two-step approach and considered first 
  whether the orange juice was a unique trademark. He concluded it was not, but 
  then observed, as has been previously noted: "Of more interest and difficulty 
  is whether the other similarities in these events are such that coincidence 
  is an objective probability [emphasis added]." He listed five similarities, 
  but does not list the orange juice. He observed that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  none of the above factors are sufficiently unique, either alone or cumulatively 
  to satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that the same person necessarily 
  committed these acts.</p>
<p>
  [65] A higher degree of scrutiny of the similarities is required where identity 
  is the issue. This requirement is explained by Justice David Watt in Watt's 
  Manual of Criminal Evidence, (Toronto: Carswell, 2002) at p. 479 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Where similar act evidence is adduced to prove identity, a 
  high degree of similarity between the acts is required. The similarity may consist 
  of</p>
<p class="indent">i. a unique trademark or signature; or</p>
<p class="indent">ii. a series of significant similarities.</p>
<p class="indent">In assessing similarity, the trial judge should only consider 
  the manner in which the acts were committed, not the evidence of D's involvement 
  in each act. As a general rule, where the trial judge is satisfied that there 
  is a sufficient degree of similarity between the acts that they were likely 
  committed by the same person, similar fact evidence will usually have sufficient 
  probative value to outweigh its prejudicial effect and justify its admission 
  [emphasis in original]. </p>
<p>
  [66] The trial judge relied on the following passage from Arp at para. 45: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; a principled approach to the admission of similar fact evidence will 
  in all cases rest on the finding that the accused's involvement in the alleged 
  similar acts or counts is unlikely to be the product of coincidence. This conclusion 
  ensures that the evidence has sufficient probative force to be admitted, and 
  will involve different considerations in different contexts. Where, as here, 
  similar fact evidence is adduced on the issue of identity, there must be a high 
  degree of similarity between the acts for the evidence to be admitted. For example, 
  a unique trademark or signature will automatically render the alleged acts 'strikingly 
  similar' and therefore highly probative and admissible. In the same way, a number 
  of significant similarities taken together, may be such that by their cumulative 
  effect, they warrant admission of the evidence. Where identity is at issue ordinarily, 
  the trial judge should review the manner in which the similar acts were committed 
  - that is to say, whether the similar acts involve a unique trademark or reveal 
  a number of significant similarities.</p>
<p>
  It appears from the trial judge's reasons, with respect, that he interpreted 
  this passage to mean that in order to find significant similarities, there must 
  be a uniqueness to the factors, either individually or cumulatively. </p>
<p>
  [67] His error, in my view, was in his emphasis on uniqueness, rather than on 
  considering whether the cumulative evidence, including the close timing of the 
  offences, revealed a series of significant similarities sufficient to render 
  the objective possibility of coincidence improbable.</p>
<p>
  [68] I agree that in itself there is nothing unique about the consumption of 
  orange juice, but when taken together with the other similarities, it seems 
  to me to reduce substantially the likelihood of coincidence.</p>
<p>
  [69] The Crown also argued that the trial judge erred in finding that the increased 
  risk of conviction increased the prejudicial impact of the similar fact evidence. 
  As Binnie J. wrote in R. v. Handy (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 481(S.C.C.) at para. 
  139, a decision which, it is important to note, had not been released when the 
  trial judge made his ruling, "[i]t is frequently mentioned that 'prejudice' 
  in this context is not the risk of conviction. It is, more properly, the risk 
  of an unfocussed trial and a wrongful conviction." </p>
<p>
  [70] In balancing prejudice and probative value, the inquiry into probative 
  value necessarily involves assessing the strength of the similar fact evidence; 
  identifying the issue at trial to which the proposed similar facts are said 
  to be relevant; and identifying the factors that connect or distinguish the 
  similar fact evidence from the facts alleged in the charge (Handy at para. 99). 
  The relative importance of the issue in the particular trial is also influential 
  in the weighing exercise (Handy at para. 74).</p>
<p>
  [71] The dissimilarities between the incidents must be taken into account: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1) In one incident, the intruder did not say anything; in the 
  other, he said "Relax"</p>
<p class="indent">2) In one incident, there was more wandering by the intruder 
  through the house</p>
<p class="indent">3) In one incident, the orange juice was left in the bedroom 
  where the assault took place, in the other the orange juice was left in the 
  empty spare bedroom</p>
<p class="indent">4) In one case, the intruder lay on top of the victim; in the 
  case of the other, he was holding a pillow over her head</p>
<p class="indent">5) In one case, the victim's husband was sleeping in a separate 
  bedroom; in the other, the husband was sleeping next to the victim</p>
<p>
  [72] There are, however, a number of significant similarities between the subject 
  matter of the charge and the similar acts, as well as the circumstances surrounding 
  the acts: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1) The intruder in both cases took orange juice out of the 
  fridge, consumed some of it, and carried it upstairs</p>
<p class="indent">2) Both victims were female</p>
<p class="indent">3) The victims were sixty-eight and seventy-five years old</p>
<p class="indent">4) Both victims had disabled husbands who were sleeping upstairs 
  at the time of the attack</p>
<p class="indent">5) Both incidents took place in Scarborough within weeks of 
  each other</p>
<p class="indent">6) The homes of both victims were within walking distance of 
  the residence of Mr. Nicholas</p>
<p class="indent">7) Both victims lived in close proximity to a park</p>
<p class="indent">8) The victims lived within blocks of each other</p>
<p class="indent">9) Both acts occurred in the early a.m. hours</p>
<p class="indent">10) The intruder in both cases took a small amount of money 
  and did not take anything else of value </p>
<p class="indent">11) Both victims described their attacker in similar terms, 
  such as "not a very big person"</p>
<p>
  [73] There is no doubt that some of these similarities are more significant 
  than others. For example, the age of the victims, the disability of their husbands, 
  the location and timing of the offences, and, in particular, the drinking of 
  the orange juice.</p>
<p>
  [74] In my view, the evidence is so strikingly similar as to elevate the probative 
  value over the inevitable prejudice. The modus operandi of the intruder in assaulting 
  elderly female victims with disabled husbands, stealing only a small amount 
  of money, and wandering throughout the house drinking orange juice, as well 
  as the time, geographic location, and pattern of the acts, render it objectively 
  improbable that Mr. Nicholas's involvement is the product of coincidence (see 
  also R. v. Fisher, [2003] S.J. No. 597 (Sask. C.A.)).</p>
<p>
  [75] Accordingly, with respect, I think the trial judge erred in law by excluding 
  this evidence.</p>
<p>
  (ii) Hearsay: The "G.W." Incident, August 21, 1999</p>
<p>
  [76] G.W. was fifty-four years old. On August 21, 1999, she awoke to find someone 
  standing by her bed. The intruder repeatedly hit her on the head, covered her 
  face with a pillow and had intercourse with her. G.W. made an eleven minute 
  911 call approximately ten minutes after the intruder left. Later, G.W. discovered 
  that her wallet had been stolen. </p>
<p>
  [77] After attending at the hospital for a rape kit examination, G.W. gave an 
  unsworn videotaped statement to the police. This occurred approximately six 
  hours after the assault. </p>
<p>
  [78] Mr. Nicholas's semen was found in G.W.'s vagina.</p>
<p>
  [79] After the attack, G.W. suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. At 
  trial, G.W.'s physician gave evidence indicating that forcing G.W. to testify 
  could result in a complete inability to function and that the prospect of having 
  to testify caused "a total deterioration in [G.W.'s] psychological status". 
  </p>
<p>
  [80] At trial, the Crown sought to rely on the 911 call, and on the videotaped 
  statement she gave to the police. During the videotaped interview, injuries 
  on G.W.'s nose, inner thigh, wrist, and ear were noted. The purpose of the evidence 
  was to establish the time of the offence, that her home was broken into, that 
  she was sexually assaulted, and that her wallet was stolen. </p>
<p>
  [81] Since she did not see the assailant's face, her statements were not relevant 
  to identification. To establish identity, the Crown was relying on the match 
  between Mr. Nicholas's DNA and the DNA obtained from G.W.'s vaginal swab. </p>
<p>
  [82] At trial, the Crown argued that both the 911 call and the videotaped police 
  statement were admissible under the principled exception to the hearsay rule. 
  The Crown's alternative argument was that the 911 call was admissible under 
  the res gestae exception. </p>
<p>
  [83] In order to satisfy the necessity and reliability requirements, the Crown 
  called Dr. P. Voorneveld, G.W.'s psychologist, who was qualified as an expert 
  in post-traumatic stress disorder and who testified that it was "impossible" 
  for G.W. to testify due to her severe anxiety. To establish necessity, Dr. Voorneveld 
  testified that there was a risk that G.W. would commit suicide if forced to 
  testify and that aids such as a closed courtroom or screen would not help.</p>
<p>
  [84] As to reliability, Dr. Voorneveld testified that the fact G.W. was able 
  to describe the incident during the call and videotaped statement indicated 
  that although she was in shock, the shock did not have a negative impact on 
  the accuracy of her statements. </p>
<p>
  [85] Defence counsel at trial argued that the criteria of necessity and reliability 
  were not met. Moreover, he asserted that since consent and identification were 
  live issues, cross-examination was important.</p>
<p>
  [86] The trial judge concluded that the videotaped statements were both reliable 
  and necessary. Further, the 911 call could be categorized as res gestae. Ultimately, 
  however, the trial judge exercised his residual discretion and excluded both 
  statements on the basis that the accused's right to full answer and defence 
  would be violated if he were denied the opportunity of cross-examining G.W based 
  on the defence's submissions as to what the issues in the trial were: </p>
<p class="indent"> It is my finding that both tapes are reliable within the meaning 
  of the law. The videotape would be admissible under the rubric of the principled 
  approach to hearsay, and the audiotape constitutes res gestae and is admissible 
  for that reason.</p>
<p class="indent">These findings are not, however, the end of the inquiry. It 
  is my overarching responsibility to ensure the fairness of the trial process 
  for the accused. The right to full answer and defence, particularly the right 
  to face and cross-examine one's accuser, ought not to be lightly diminished. 
  It is quite difficult for me to imagine the utility of what cross-examination 
  may be undertaken given the facts of this. But this is entirely within the province 
  of defence counsel and is not for me to say. My sympathy for the victim can 
  be no justification for denying this accused due process [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="indent">For these considerations, I must find that these tapes may not 
  be admitted as a substitute for viva voce evidence from [G.W.]. While the tapes 
  may be necessary in the legal sense and may well be reliable, I find those factors 
  insufficient to override the rights of the accused to make full answer and defence. 
</p>
<p>
  [87] On appeal, the Crown argued that the trial judge erred in exercising his 
  residual discretion to exclude the statements. Defence counsel argued that the 
  trial judge was correct in excluding the statements, or, in the alternative, 
  that the trial judge erred in finding the statements to be necessary and reliable, 
  and in characterizing the 911 call as res gestae.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [88] In R. v. Dakin (1995), 80 O.A.C. 253 (Ont. C.A.) the accused was charged 
  with the murder of two women who died as a result of burns. The Crown sought 
  to introduce statements made by one of the women an hour after the fire. The 
  Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's decision to admit the statement under 
  the spontaneous statements exception referred to in R. v. Clark (1983), 7 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 46 (Ont. C.A.), citing R. v. Khan (1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 197 (Ont. C.A.) 
  at 207: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [A] spontaneous statement made under the stress or pressure of a dramatic or 
  startling act or event and relating to such an occasion may be admissible as 
  an exception to the hearsay rule. The stress or pressure of the act or event 
  must be such that the possibility of concoction or deception can be safely discounted. 
  The statement need not be made strictly contem-poraneous to the occurrence so 
  long as the stress or pressure created by it is ongoing and the statement is 
  made before there has been time to contrive or misrepresent. The admissibility 
  of such statements is dependent on the possibility of concoction or fabrication. 
  Where the spontaneity of the statement is clear and the danger of fabrication 
  is remote, the evidence should be received.</p>
<p>
  [89] In my view, the trial judge did not err in classifying the 911 call as 
  falling within the res gestae exception. The call was made within ten minutes 
  of the attack and there has been no suggestion that G.W. had any motive for 
  misrepresenting what happened that night.</p>
<p>
  [90] Nor do I see any error in the trial judge's finding that the statements 
  she made in the 911 call or in her videotaped statement were necessary and reliable. 
  </p>
<p>
  [91] With respect to reliability, the 911 call was made approximately ten minutes 
  after the attack, indicating that there was little time to fabricate. It was 
  audiotaped and the police statement was videotaped. The police statement, although 
  not under oath, was not elicited by leading questions. The location of the statement, 
  taken at the police station and made to a person in authority is also indicative 
  of reliability (see R. v. Fleet (2001), 48 C.R. (5th) 28 (N.S. C.A.)). The trial 
  judge found that G.W.'s demeanour was credible. Perhaps most significantly, 
  he found an absence of any motive to fabricate and that G.W.'s statement was 
  not consistent with other hypotheses. (See Justice David Watt, Watt's Manual 
  of Criminal Evidence, (Toronto: Carswell, 2002) at pp. 368-372)). </p>
<p>
  [92] The trial judge was satisfied, based on the evidence of Dr. Voorneveld, 
  that the complainant was unable to attend court. Her out of court statements 
  were necessary, not for identity, but to establish that there was a break in 
  by an unknown assailant, that there was an assault, and the time of the assault. 
  </p>
<p>
  [93] In R. v. Dubois (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 544 (Que. C.A.) a child's out of 
  court statements were found to be necessary when a psychologist testified that 
  the trauma of testifying would aggravate the boy's trauma and impede his development. 
  (See also R. v. R. (R.) (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 11 (Ont. C.A.) aff'd [2003] 
  S.C.J. No. 3 (S.C.C.)</p>
<p>
  [94] Although it is rare for a complainant to be found unable to testify, where 
  the hearsay statements were found to be reliable and where the evidence of the 
  psychologist that the complainant could not testify was uncontradicted, the 
  trial judge was entitled to conclude that the necessity and reliability tests 
  have been met.</p>
<p>
  [95] Notwithstanding his conclusion that the necessity and reliability requirements 
  were met, the trial judge decided to exclude the evidence nonetheless based 
  on its detrimental impact on the defence's ability to make full answer and defence. 
  This conclusion was, with respect, based on an erroneous principle, namely, 
  that he was obliged to defer to defence counsel assertions about the utility 
  of cross-examining G.W. in spite of his own serious misgivings about its value.</p>
<p>
  [96] In R. v. Smith, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915 at p. 934, the Supreme Court concluded 
  that "where criteria of necessity and reliability are satisfied, the lack 
  of testing by cross-examination goes to weight, not admissibility, and a properly 
  cautioned jury should be able to evaluate the evidence on that basis". 
  </p>
<p>
  [97] As the Crown indicated, the statements are relevant only to the following 
  issues: the fact that the assault occurred, that it occurred to G.W., and when 
  it occurred. Defence counsel, however, relied on the need to cross-examine G.W. 
  based on the issues of identification and consent. </p>
<p>
  [98] As previously noted, it is clear from both statements that G.W. was unable 
  to describe her attacker since he was holding a pillow over her face. Her statements, 
  therefore, were of no relevance to identity. What the Crown relied on exclusively 
  to establish identity was the match between Mr. Nicholas' DNA and the DNA from 
  G.W.'s vaginal swab. </p>
<p>
  [99] Moreover, the issue of consent, or honest but mistaken belief in consent, 
  cannot arise on these facts, where the victim had a pillow over her face during 
  the entire assault, facts which are clearly inconsistent with consent or mistaken 
  belief in consent, or with her ability to identify the accused. The inability 
  to cross-examine, therefore, had little prejudicial impact in these circumstances.</p>
<p>
  [100] The trial judge did not find any actual prejudice to the accused or to 
  the trial process. As the trial judge himself stated, "[I]t is quite difficult 
  for me to imagine the utility of what cross-examination may be undertaken given 
  the facts of this case." </p>
<p>
  [101] In the absence of any evidence indicating how the admission of the statements 
  would actually prejudice the accused and the trial process, having found them 
  to be necessary and reliable, there was no basis for excluding them. </p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [102] Accordingly, Mr. Nicholas's appeal from conviction is dismissed. I would 
  allow both Crown appeals, set aside the acquittals, and direct new trials. </p>
