<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The respondent Mercedes-Benz Credit of Canada (&quot;Mercedes&quot;) successfully 
  moved for a summary judgment dismissing the appellant's action against Mercedes. 
  The appellant now appeals that dismissal.</p>
<p>[2] Mercedes financed the purchase of a truck for the appellant. Under the 
  agreement between the appellant and Mercedes, title of the truck remained with 
  Mercedes. Under the agreement, any insurance proceeds payable as a result of 
  damage to the truck were payable to Mercedes.</p>
<p>[3] The truck was damaged by fire and a dispute arose between the appellant 
  and his insurer over the payment of certain proceeds from the sale of the damaged 
  truck. </p>
<p>[4] The appellant contends that Mercedes improperly interfered with his negotiations 
  with the insurer and that, consequently, those negotiations did not come to 
  fruition. The appellant contends that the value of the truck decreased substantially 
  after the negotiations failed. The appellant further contends that he is entitled 
  to set off the decrease in the value of the truck against any money owing under 
  the financing agreement to Mercedes.</p>
<p>[5] We cannot accept this submission. Assuming the claim as described by the 
  appellant is actually found in the pleadings, there was no evidence before the 
  motion judge to support that claim. The appellant relies on para. 12 of his 
  affidavit. It reads:</p>
<p class="indent">Markel Insurance then indicated to me that they could not cash 
  the cheque because they were being inhibited by the defendant, Mercedes-Benz 
  Credit, who were claiming an interest in the vehicle.</p>
<p>[6] The allegation in paragraph 12 offers no support for the appellant's contention. 
  It does no more than indicate that Mercedes was claiming an interest in the 
  vehicle in its discussions with the insurer. Mercedes had an interest in the 
  vehicle and an interest in the insurance proceeds. </p>
<p>[7] As there was no evidence to support the only claim advanced by the appellant 
  against Mercedes, this was a proper case for summary judgment. </p>
<p>[8] The appeal is dismissed with costs all to the respondent in the amount 
  of $3,800.00.</p>
