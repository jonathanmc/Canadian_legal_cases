<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice John G. J. O'Driscoll of the 
  Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated October 18, 2001, and 
  the sentence imposed by Justice O'Driscoll dated October 19, 2001. </p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. Introduction</p>
<p>
  [1] In early 1997 Cindy Greaves, then seventeen years old, left the Children's 
  Aid Society residence where she had been staying and went to live in a home 
  occupied by her friend Lanelle Chiasson, Lanelle's three siblings and mother, 
  Elizabeth Chiasson, and Elizabeth Chiasson's boyfriend, the appellant, Robert 
  Noftall. Ms. Greaves alleged that over the course of three months the appellant 
  sexually assaulted her numerous times. These assaults included two incidents 
  of forced sexual intercourse. After the second incident Ms. Greaves left the 
  Chiasson home. Soon afterwards she recounted what had occurred in a videotaped 
  statement to the police. </p>
<p>
  [2] At the appellant's trial before O'Driscoll J. and a jury in the fall of 
  2001, Ms. Greaves' testimony in chief consisted almost entirely of her videotaped 
  statement, which she adopted and was admitted in evidence under s. 715.1 of 
  the Criminal Code. The trial judge then gave the jury a copy of the videotape 
  for its use during its deliberations. </p>
<p>
  [3] The jury convicted the appellant of sexual assault. The trial judge sentenced 
  him to eight years in a penitentiary. The appellant appeals both his conviction 
  and his sentence. The main issue on the conviction appeal is whether giving 
  the jury Ms. Greaves' videotaped statement deprived the appellant of a fair 
  trial.</p>
<p>
  B. Background</p>
<p>
  (a) Factual overview</p>
<p>
  [4] The complainant, Cindy Greaves, had been a depressed, vulnerable and needy 
  teenager. Her relationships with her own family had been fraught with difficulty. 
  At fifteen she became a ward of the Children's Aid Society, living in one of 
  its homes. But she was unhappy there. She wanted to move in with a member of 
  her family. Unfortunately, no one in her family wanted her.</p>
<p>
  [5] The complainant met Lanelle Chiasson at school and they became friends. 
  At the end of January 1997, without the permission of the Children's Aid Society, 
  Ms. Greaves accepted an invitation to live in the Chiasson home. She was looking 
  for the comfort and security of a happy family environment. The Chiasson home, 
  however, was anything but happy. </p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant had recently moved in. Although thirty-four years old, he 
  had very little parenting experience. He had last seen his own three children 
  in 1984 when he separated from his wife. He had spent half his adult life in 
  jail. </p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant tried to be a father figure in the Chiasson household by being 
  a strict disciplinarian. This created tension. His more lenient treatment of 
  the complainant, whom he perceived to be his "little girl", only added 
  to the tension. So too did the appellant's frequent use of drugs, his admitted 
  violent temper, and his controlling manner in the home. The complainant, too, 
  was unstable, prone to sudden fits of anger and to bouts of depression. </p>
<p>
  [8] In the midst of this unhappy home life, the complainant alleged that the 
  appellant engaged in an escalating course of sexual abuse, culminating in the 
  two incidents of sexual intercourse, which took place in the van the appellant 
  used for his moving business and which prompted the complainant to leave the 
  Chiasson home at the beginning of May 1997. </p>
<p>
  (b) Positions at trial</p>
<p>
  [9] At trial, the Crown's case rested primarily on two planks: Ms. Greaves' 
  videotaped statement to the police given on June 19, 1997, and admitted under 
  s. 715.1 of the Code; and Elizabeth Chiasson's testimony that, while having 
  sex with her shortly after Ms. Greaves had left the household, the appellant 
  cried out the name "Cindy". </p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant testified and denied that he had sexually assaulted the complainant. 
  He acknowledged his lengthy criminal record but pointed out that he had never 
  been convicted of a sexual offence and claimed that sex offenders disgusted 
  him.</p>
<p>
  [11] The appellant admitted that he had paid special attention to Ms. Greaves, 
  but he said that he had done so because she was needier than the other children 
  in the home. He had tried to console her when she became upset, and had gone 
  to her room at night when she cried. The defence's theory was that the complainant 
  had fabricated her allegations to regain benefits from the Children's Aid Society 
  that she might otherwise have lost because she had left the Society's care without 
  permission. She was approaching her eighteenth birthday and unless she returned 
  to the Society before she turned eighteen it would not take her back. </p>
<p>
  (c) The appellant's submissions on appeal</p>
<p>
  [12] The appellant advances three submissions on his appeal against conviction: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) The trial judge erred in giving Ms. Greaves' videotaped 
  statement to the jury for its use during its deliberations; alternatively, he 
  erred in not also giving the jury the transcript of the cross-examination of 
  Ms. Greaves on her statement. </p>
<p class="indent">(2) The trial judge erred in permitting Elizabeth Chiasson to 
  testify about the appellant's inculpatory utterances while they had sex; alternatively, 
  he failed to properly instruct the jury on its use of these utterances.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) The trial judge erred in his instruction to the jury on 
  reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>
  We called on the Crown to respond only to the first submission. </p>
<p>
  [13] On his sentence appeal the appellant submits that eight years is outside 
  the recognized range for his offence and is therefore unfit. </p>
<p>
  C. The conviction appeal</p>
<p>
  Appellant's first submission: The trial judge erred in giving Ms. Greaves' videotaped 
  statement to the jury for its use during its deliberations.</p>
<p>
  (a) Introduction</p>
<p>
  [14] This submission has three branches. First, the appellant argues that the 
  trial judge had no discretion to let the videotape go to the jury room. Second, 
  he argues that if the trial judge had a discretion, he exercised it improperly 
  by giving the jury the videotape. Third, he argues in the alternative that the 
  trial judge erred by not also giving the jury the transcript of Ms. Greaves' 
  cross-examination. </p>
<p>
  [15] As the appellant acknowledges, his first argument is foreclosed by the 
  decision of this court in R. v. Toten (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 225 at 268. There, 
  Doherty J.A. writing for a five member panel held that a trial judge had a discretion 
  to permit the jury during its deliberations to view a videotaped statement taken 
  under s. 715.1 of the Code. He justified this discretion by observing that a 
  videotape is not "so different from other forms of testimonial evidence 
  which routinely go into the jury room as exhibits". In exercising this 
  discretion, in Doherty J.A.'s words "the trial judge must decide how to 
  best facilitate the jury's deliberations while maintaining the fairness of the 
  process." I know of no case law or other developments since Toten that 
  either casts doubt on its authority or suggests its reconsideration. </p>
<p>
  [16] Thus, the gravamen of the appellant's submission on the videotaped statement 
  centres on his contention that the trial judge exercised his discretion improperly 
  either by giving the jury the videotape at all, or by giving the jury the videotape 
  but not the cross-examination on it. </p>
<p>
  [17] The potential unfairness of giving the jury only the videotape - especially 
  in a case where it comprised virtually all of the complainant's evidence in 
  chief - arises from the possibility that a jury would give it far more emphasis 
  than other equally relevant evidence. Morden J.A. discussed this risk in R. 
  v. Pleich (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 13 (Ont. C.A.). In that case the trial judge 
  had permitted tapes of intercepted telephone conversations to go to the jury 
  room. Although Morden J.A. concluded that the trial judge did not err in doing 
  so, he pointed out at 32 that the practice of permitting the jury to use a tape 
  carried "the risk that such evidence will thereby receive such an undue 
  emphasis compared to the oral evidence which the jury has heard."</p>
<p>
  [18] Applied to this case, Pleich and Toten stand for the proposition that the 
  trial judge's exercise of discretion is reviewable if there is a reasonable 
  likelihood the jury gave undue emphasis to Ms. Greaves' videotaped statement 
  and in doing so deprived the appellant of a fair trial. </p>
<p>
  [19] To test this proposition in this case I will discuss the contents of the 
  statement, the trial judge's ruling and whether that ruling amounted to a reversible 
  error. </p>
<p>
  (b) Ms. Greaves' statement</p>
<p>
  [20] Section 715.1 of the Criminal Code sets out the conditions for admissibility 
  of Ms. Greaves' videotaped statement: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In any proceeding relating to an offence under section 151, 152, 153, 155 or 
  159, subsection 160(2) or (3), or section 163.1, 170, 171, 172, 173, 210, 211, 
  212, 213, 266, 267, 268, 271, 272, or 273, in which the complainant or other 
  witness was under the age of eighteen years at the time the offence is alleged 
  to have been committed, a videotape made within a reasonable time after the 
  alleged offence, in which the complainant or witness describes the acts complained 
  of, is admissible in evidence if the complainant or witness, while testifying, 
  adopts the contents of the videotape. </p>
<p>
  These conditions were met. Sexual assault is a listed offence (under s. 271 
  of the Code). Ms. Greaves was seventeen at the time of the alleged offence. 
  She gave the statement on June 19, 1997, about a month and a half after she 
  had left the Chiasson household. And she adopted the statement at trial. Indeed, 
  save for one additional allegation, which I will refer to, her statement amounted 
  to her entire evidence in chief. Once admitted under s. 715.1 her statement 
  became testimonial evidence as if she had testified in open court.</p>
<p>
  [21] In her statement, Ms. Greaves described in great detail the appellant's 
  sexually abusive conduct. It began with rude and inappropriate comments. The 
  appellant told Ms. Greaves she had "a cute little sweet butt" and 
  "sexy legs". He spoke vulgarly to her about his sexual proclivities 
  with remarks such as "If I can't eat it I won't fuck it." When they 
  hugged he caressed her back "like you would hug your lover". When 
  they parted his penis was erect. </p>
<p>
  [22] Once the family moved, Ms. Greaves had her own bedroom and the appellant's 
  sexual abuse became more serious. The appellant began coming to her room at 
  different times during the night to "cuddle" with her. He got under 
  the covers wearing just his underwear and sometimes his shirt. Ms. Greaves complained 
  that she did not like some of the ways he touched her. He replied that he was 
  just showing how much he cared and that there was "no difference between 
  your arm, your hand, your breast and your behind".</p>
<p>
  [23] Later, while in the complainant's bed, the appellant started "pumping" 
  against her, "pressing himself in and out towards [her]". He also 
  "went down" on her at least twice, fingered her, digitally penetrated 
  her, touched her breast, lay on top of her, rubbed her vaginal area and performed 
  oral sex on her. </p>
<p>
  [24] The complainant said that the appellant had enlisted her help in his moving 
  business. She accompanied him in his van to various moving jobs. At first she 
  enjoyed the work. But that changed. </p>
<p>
  [25] Often other workers were in the front seat and for lack of room she was 
  obliged to sit on the appellant's lap. While there, "he'd get his crotch 
  right up against my butt". She described the appellant digitally penetrating 
  her under a coat while two workers were seated beside her in the van. She claimed 
  that the appellant said, "Oh God you made me lube. I had lube coming out 
  of me like anything." He exposed his erection telling her, "You know, 
  you give me an instant hard on." </p>
<p>
  [26] When just the complainant was in the van the appellant would park and ask 
  her questions such as, "Can I come inside you?&#133;[O]h please, just for 
  a minute and I'll take it back out." </p>
<p>
  [27] The two most serious sexual assaults - forced intercourse - took place 
  in the van after the appellant had dropped off his co-workers and was alone 
  with the complainant. The first occurred at the end of April 1997. While they 
  were in the back of the van the appellant had sexual intercourse with Ms. Greaves. 
  She protested, telling him "no, no, no" throughout. </p>
<p>
  [28] The second incident occurred a few days later. The appellant twice had 
  vaginal intercourse with Ms. Greaves without her consent. During her evidence 
  in chief at trial the complainant added the allegation that during one of the 
  incidents of sexual intercourse the appellant had also performed oral sex on 
  her. </p>
<p>
  [29] Ms. Greaves said that the morning after the second incident of intercourse 
  the appellant came into her bedroom and asked her whether having made love meant 
  anything to her. He wanted to touch her and wanted her to roll on top of him. 
  By then she had had enough. She decided to leave the household and to try to 
  get her life back on track.</p>
<p>
  (c) Did the trial judge's ruling amount to a reversible error in the exercise 
  of his discretion?</p>
<p>
  [30] After the complainant's videotaped statement was admitted the trial judge 
  told the jury that it would be given a copy during its deliberations. The defence 
  immediately objected on two bases: the jury would have the complainant's evidence 
  in chief but not the cross-examination; and the jury would have that evidence 
  in a most compelling form. The trial judge declined to rule at that time. </p>
<p>
  [31] After all the trial evidence was in, the defence renewed its objection, 
  adding the submission that because the trial had been short, the jury did not 
  need the videotape to remember the complainant's evidence. Again, the trial 
  judge did not rule on the objection. </p>
<p>
  [32] The following day, for the first time, the Crown joined defence counsel 
  in submitting that neither the videotaped statement nor a transcript of it should 
  go to the jury room "primarily because the videotape makes up the entire 
  examination in chief".</p>
<p>
  [33] Despite the Crown's concession, the trial judge exercised his discretion 
  by giving the jury the videotaped statement for its use during its deliberations. 
  In his view the rationale underlying s. 715.1 of the Code would be undermined 
  if the jury did not have the videotape. He held: </p>
<p class="indent"> When one considers the reasons for and the purposes of s. 715.1 
  of the Criminal Code, the videotaped interviews of complainants, I would think 
  that Parliament anticipated that, in most cases, the evidence of a person under 
  eighteen years of age, the complainant, would go before the trier of fact as 
  "the evidence" in chief of the complainant, because the purpose of this is to 
  capture the best recollections of the complainant at the time closest to the 
  alleged offence. That purpose would be negated if the trier of fact is allowed 
  only a one-time viewing in court and later viewing only by request in returning 
  to the courtroom; see R. v. F. (C.C.) (1997), 220 N.R. 362 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, the trial is four years and five months after 
  the date of the alleged offence. It seems to me that the time factor alone is 
  good reason why the jury should be entitled to what Parliament feels are the 
  best recollections of the complainant at the time of the alleged offences. Moreover, 
  in this case I am influenced by the fact of the nature of the defence, that 
  is that the matters alleged never happened, it is all made up of whole cloth. 
  In my view, the jury's task will be made easier if they are allowed to take 
  Exhibit A to the jury room for private hearing and viewing. In my view, any 
  prejudice to the accused is negligible. </p>
<p>
  [34] The trial judge's ruling raises two concerns. The first concern is that 
  he overrode the joint position of Crown and defence - and a position taken by 
  the Crown after careful consideration. The trial judge of course was not bound 
  by counsels' position, but it seems to me that he lacked a compelling reason 
  for departing from it. </p>
<p>
  [35] The second concern is that his reasoning for giving the jury the videotape 
  was erroneous. His reasoning explains why the court had discretion to admit 
  the videotaped statement, not why it should go to the jury room. Worse, his 
  reasoning indicates that during their deliberations the jurors needed more access 
  to the videotape than to other pieces of evidence, thus suggesting that the 
  videotape had special status. In his words, the purpose of the videotaped statement 
  "would be negated if the trier of fact is allowed only a one-time viewing 
  in court and later viewing only by request". Yet the risk the jury would 
  give the videotape special status - "undue emphasis" - is precisely 
  the risk Pleich cautions against. </p>
<p>
  [36] Despite these concerns about the trial judge's reasoning, the issue remains 
  whether giving the jury the videotape deprived the appellant of a fair trial. 
  The appellant says that it did. He asserts that the jury likely gave the videotape 
  undue emphasis, and that it either should not have been given the tape or it 
  should have been given both the tape and the transcript of Ms. Greaves' cross-examination. 
  The appellant contends that the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in R. v. 
  Olbey, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1008 requires that if the jury is given one it has to 
  be given the other. </p>
<p>
  [37] I do not accept the appellant's position. I do not consider it reasonably 
  likely the jury gave the videotape undue emphasis. And because I do not think 
  that the complainant's cross-examination undermines her evidence on the videotape, 
  it was not necessary to give the jury the transcript of the cross-examination 
  along with the videotape. </p>
<p>
  [38] I agree with Ms. Klukach for the Crown that there would be a risk the jury 
  gave the videotape undue emphasis if cogent evidence had been pitted against 
  the videotaped statement, and the jury did not have equal access to this evidence. 
  However, there was no such evidence here. The cross-examination of the complainant 
  did not weaken or qualify the substance of Ms. Greaves' detailed allegations. 
  Her account of the sexual assaults was virtually unchallenged. Also, the appellant 
  did not offer a contradictory version of the incidents in question. Instead, 
  his defence was an outright denial of any sexual contact with the complainant. 
  </p>
<p>
  [39] Moreover, in his charge, the trial judge cautioned the jurors that the 
  videotaped statement was not special and that it ought not to unduly influence 
  their deliberations. He told the jury that it was not required to view the videotape 
  unless it wanted to. He also highlighted the parts of the complainant's cross-examination 
  that were helpful to the defence: her evidence that she lied continuously to 
  the Children's Aid Society and that she had threatened to falsely accuse a group 
  home worker. </p>
<p>
  [40] Finally, the principle in Olbey does not assist the appellant. In Olbey, 
  an Ontario case, McIntyre J. accepted that when a jury asks to re-hear part 
  of the evidence of a witness it must also be given any qualifying evidence. 
  McIntyre J. expressly agreed with the following passage from the reasons of 
  Martin J.A. at 1027-1028: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I accept, of course, the proposition that where the jury requests that the evidence 
  of a witness be read back, it is incumbent on the trial Judge not to allow the 
  jury to hear a part only of the evidence of the witness without also hearing 
  those portions of the evidence of the witness, whether given in-chief or in 
  cross-examination, which weaken or qualify the part read, even though the jury 
  indicates that it does not wish to hear any more of the witness's evidence. 
  Otherwise, the jury is not hearing the evidence of the witness, but only an 
  incomplete, or even an inaccurate account of his or her testimony. </p>
<p>
  [41] Olbey deals with the situation where the jury asks to have some of the 
  witness's evidence read back. The very request suggests the jury might give 
  the evidence undue emphasis and ignore or give less weight to other contrary 
  or qualifying evidence. To guard against that risk Olbey requires that the jury 
  be given the witness's complete account.</p>
<p>
  [42] Olbey does not directly apply here because the jury did not request a copy 
  of the videotaped statement for its deliberations. Nonetheless, had I concluded 
  that there was a reasonable likelihood the jury would have given the statement 
  undue emphasis or that the complainant's cross-examination qualified her evidence 
  in chief, then I would have held, consistent with Olbey, that the transcript 
  of her cross-examination should also have gone to the jury room. But because 
  the risks that concerned the court in Olbey, Pleich and Toten are not significant 
  here, the trial judge's ruling did not deprive the appellant of a fair trial. 
  I would therefore not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [43] I will now deal briefly with the appellant's other two submissions on his 
  conviction appeal. </p>
<p>
  Appellant's second submission: the trial judge erred in permitting Elizabeth 
  Chiasson to testify about the appellant's inculpatory utterances.</p>
<p>
  [44] The background of this submission is as follows. Over the defence's objection 
  the trial judge allowed Elizabeth Chiasson to testify about an incident that 
  allegedly occurred about three weeks after Ms. Greaves left the household. The 
  appellant and Ms. Chiasson were in bed. He was high on crack cocaine; she was 
  asleep face down. He began having anal sex with her and wouldn't stop though 
  she protested that it was painful. Then, as if "in a daze", he said 
  things like, "Oh Cindy, you're so sweet", "Cindy, my girl", 
  "Cindy I love you". Ms. Chiasson testified that the same thing happened 
  a few more times and each time the appellant's words were "exactly the 
  same". </p>
<p>
  [45] The appellant's position at trial, repeated on appeal, was that this evidence 
  was highly prejudicial and should not have been admitted. The trial judge held 
  that the probative value of Ms. Chiasson's evidence exceeded its potential prejudicial 
  effect. We agree. </p>
<p>
  [46] The context in which the Crown sought to elicit the evidence was important. 
  As the trial judge recognized, the evidence would have had much less probative 
  value if the issue in this case was consent. But the issue was not whether Ms. 
  Greaves consented to sexual activity with the appellant, but whether sexual 
  activity occurred at all. In this context, the jury could conclude that the 
  appellant's utterances were tantamount to an admission of guilt. At a minimum, 
  the jury could infer from this evidence that the appellant's claim that he had 
  only a paternal interest in the complainant was false. </p>
<p>
  [47] Balanced against its probative value, the risk that the jury would misuse 
  the evidence by engaging in prohibited propensity reasoning was small. In his 
  recharge - just before the jury began its deliberations - the trial judge forcefully 
  instructed the jury not to use Ms. Chiasson's evidence to infer that the appellant 
  was "the type" of person to commit the offence charged. The defence 
  did not object to this recharge. Moreover, the appellant had already acknowledged 
  that a good deal of his conduct - drug use, a criminal lifestyle, failings as 
  a parent - had been discreditable. </p>
<p>
  [48] We therefore find no reviewable error in the trial judge's decision to 
  admit the evidence or in his instruction to the jury on its use. </p>
<p>
  Appellant's third submission: the trial judge erred in his instruction to the 
  jury on reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [49] This submission springs from the appellant's contention that in his discussion 
  of circumstantial evidence the trial judge impermissibly lowered the burden 
  of proof by telling the jury: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The law does not demand that you act upon certainties alone. In our daily activities 
  we act upon reasonable grounds. So too, in court, a fact may be proved by circumstantial 
  evidence. </p>
<p>
  [50] There are two answers to the appellant's contention. First, the passage 
  the appellant complains of is a small part of a much longer instruction in which 
  the trial judge was trying to explain to the jury that circumstantial evidence 
  could be as cogent as direct evidence and that the jury was entitled to establish 
  facts based on reasonable inferences from the evidence. The trial judge's discussion 
  of circumstantial evidence, therefore, did not undermine or even qualify his 
  separate instruction on the meaning of reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>
  [51] The second answer to the appellant's submission is that the trial judge 
  gave a reasonable doubt instruction almost identical to the instruction approved 
  of by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lifchus, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320. The 
  hurdle for appellate intervention on a reasonable doubt instruction is whether 
  there is any reasonable likelihood the jury misapprehended or misapplied the 
  burden or standard of proof. The appellant did not meet this hurdle. His submission 
  on this point therefore fails. </p>
<p>
  [52] I would dismiss the conviction appeal.</p>
<p>
  D. The sentence appeal</p>
<p>
  [53] The appellant submits that his eight-year sentence is outside the range 
  recognized by this court. As no facts take it outside this range, his sentence 
  is unfit. I agree with this submission. </p>
<p>
  [54] The appellant undoubtedly committed a serious offence. He occupied a position 
  of trust towards a vulnerable victim. His sexual abuse amounted to a breach 
  of that trust. His sexual assaults included two incidents of sexual intercourse. 
  A significant penitentiary sentence was warranted. </p>
<p>
  [55] In R. v. B.(J.) (1990), 36 O.A.C. 307 this court confirmed that in cases 
  of sexual abuse of a young person, where the abuse includes sexual intercourse 
  and a convicted person occupies a position of trust toward the victim, the usual 
  range of sentence is three to five years. Aggravating or mitigating factors 
  may put the sentence at the higher or lower end of that range. Thus, Blair J.A. 
  wrote at para. 5: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The decisions of provincial appellate courts establish that, except in unusual 
  circumstances, a penitentiary sentence is called for in all cases of sexual 
  abuse of children to whom the convicted person stands in loco parentis if the 
  abuse involves sexual intercourse. Such sentences reflect society's denunciation 
  of this abhorrent conduct and the breach of trust reposed on parents or guardians 
  of children. Both counsel agreed that the usual range of sentences for this 
  type of offence is from three to five years. The length of sentence within the 
  range of three to five years depends on a number of factors. These include the 
  age of the victim, the duration and frequency of the sexual assaults, the criminal 
  record of the offender, the effects on the victim and the presence or absence 
  of collateral violence or remorse. </p>
<p>
  [56] Subsequent decisions of this court have affirmed this range. See R. v. 
  M.(D.) (1999), 136 C.C.C. (3d) 412, R. v. D.A.H. (2003), 171 C.C.C. (3d) 309 
  and R. v. B.L. (2000), 138 O.A.C. 383.</p>
<p>
  [57] Here, two aggravating factors put the sentence at the high end of the range: 
  the appellant had a lengthy criminal record; and the complainant suffered traumatic 
  psychological scars, in part because of the sexual assaults and in part because 
  the appellant terrorized the Chiasson household. </p>
<p>
  [58] Additional aggravating factors may entitle a court to impose a sentence 
  exceeding the usual range. In R. v. B.(J.) itself this court upheld a sentence 
  of eight years where the accused had sexually abused his stepdaughter for eight 
  years, despite an intervening conviction for attempted rape, and where the acts 
  of intercourse were accompanied by threats of punishment if the victim did not 
  comply. In R. v. B.L. this court upheld a sentence of six and a half years where 
  the incest lasted seven years and twice resulted in the victim becoming pregnant. 
  </p>
<p>
  [59] Here, no such additional aggravating factors were present. The assaults 
  lasted for three months; they were not accompanied by violence or threats of 
  violence beyond the offence itself; the complainant did not suffer any physical 
  injury; and the appellant's long criminal record contained no previous conviction 
  for sexual offences. </p>
<p>
  [60] In my view, the trial judge erred in imposing a sentence beyond the usual 
  range accepted by this court. I would grant leave to appeal sentence, allow 
  the sentence appeal, and reduce the appellant's sentence to five years. </p>
<p>
  E. Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [61] I would dismiss the conviction appeal. I would allow the sentence appeal 
  by reducing the appellant's sentence to five years in the penitentiary.</p>
