<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Rose Boyko of the Superior Court of Justice 
  dated May 20, 2003.</p>
<p>
  ABELLA J.A.:</p>
<p>
  [1] In his will, Gordon Noik bequeathed his seven rental properties to his adult 
  daughter "provided that" she pay part of the monthly rent she collected 
  to his widow, her stepmother. The issue in this case is the validity of this 
  limitation on his gift to his daughter.</p>
<p>
  Background </p>
<p>
  [2] Gordon Noik died in 2002. He had been married to Klara Noik, his second 
  wife, for twenty-four years. She was not the mother of his children. His will 
  transferred all of his property to his two adult children, Gad Noik and Miriam 
  Rosen, and to their stepmother, Klara Noik. Gad Noik was the estate trustee. 
  A copy of the will is attached to these reasons as a Schedule. </p>
<p>
  [3] Mr. Noik left his wife the matrimonial home, "all articles of personal, 
  domestic and household use or ornament", and the residue of his estate. 
  </p>
<p>
  [4] In para. 3(e) of his will, Mr. Noik transferred his interest in seven listed 
  properties in North Bay to his daughter, in the following language:</p>
<p class="indent"> I GIVE all my property wheresoever situate, including any property 
  over which I may have a general power of appointment, to my Trustee upon the 
  following trusts, namely:</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> to pay or transfer to my daughter MIRIAM ROSEN, of the City 
  of Herzlia, in the State of Israel, my interest in the following properties 
  which are all situated in the City of North Bay, in the Province of Ontario:</p>
<p class="indent"> 470 Chippewa Street West</p>
<p class="indent"> 187 Princess Street West</p>
<p class="indent"> 389 Kingsway Street</p>
<p class="indent"> 899 O'Brien Street</p>
<p class="indent"> 363 Lansdown Avenue</p>
<p class="indent"> 229 Victoria Street West</p>
<p class="indent"> 233 Victoria Street West</p>
<p class="indent"> PROVIDED that my said daughter pay to my wife, KLARA NOIK, 
  $1,300.00 monthly from the rent derived from said properties.</p>
<p>
  [5] The requirement that $1,300 be paid monthly from the rent to Mr. Noik's 
  widow is the source of the dispute between the parties. The properties have 
  by now all been sold.</p>
<p>
  [6] When the trustee informed Mr. Noik's widow that, in his view, she was not 
  entitled to the monthly payments, she sought directions from the Superior Court. 
  The motions judge held that "the title must go to the daughter absolutely 
  without condition." </p>
<p>
  [7] The motions judge's conclusion about the testator's intention was: "On 
  its face, the testator intended to benefit both his daughter and his wife, by 
  giving his property to his daughter on the condition that she pay a portion 
  of the rent to her stepmother." However, she found the provision that Mr. 
  Noik's daughter pay rent to the appellant to be a "condition subsequent" 
  which was "highly uncertain". </p>
<p>
  [8] As a result, she found this provision to be void, finding that while its 
  purpose was clear, its terms were uncertain. The motions judge based her analysis 
  on the conventional rule against uncertain conditions in Re Sifton, [1938] O.R. 
  529 (P.C.). Specifically, she found the uncertainty revolved around the fact 
  that the will did not stipulate for how long the daughter was required to pay 
  the monthly amount, nor did it state whether she could dispose of her property. 
  </p>
<p>
  [9] The motions judge also found that the direction to pay rent unlawfully restrained 
  the daughter's "intended use of the property".</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [10] In interpreting wills, the objective is to determine the testator's intention. 
  In this case, Mr. Noik's intent could hardly be clearer. The motions judge found, 
  and both parties acknowledge, that Mr. Noik intended this provision to benefit 
  both his daughter and his wife. I see no legal impediment to interpreting the 
  will in a way which implements this intention. </p>
<p>
  [11] It seems to me that before a provision can be found to be sufficiently 
  uncertain to defeat the intention of the testator, the threshold should be a 
  high one. This provision falls well below that invalidating height.</p>
<p>
  [12] In Re Sifton, the uncertain clause was struck because the testator's intent 
  could not be discerned. The contrary is true in this case. Reading the will 
  as a whole and this provision in particular, it is clear that the testator intended 
  not only that his daughter get the benefit of owning the rental properties, 
  but also that the gift carried with it a duty to pay $1,300 monthly to his widow 
  during her lifetime. Striking the provision requiring the monthly payments would 
  defeat Mr. Noik's intention that both his daughter and his widow benefit from 
  the rental properties, an intention clearly reflected in the bequest.</p>
<p>
  [13] I also disagree with the motions judge's finding that the requirement to 
  make monthly payments improperly restrained the daughter's ability to use and 
  enjoy her property absolutely. Restraints on use, enjoyment and alienation are 
  generally prohibited on the principle that gifts of property should be given 
  absolutely. </p>
<p>
  [14] In my view, Mr. Noik did not grant his daughter an absolute interest in 
  the rental properties. Rather, the interest he granted her was limited by the 
  requirement to make monthly payments to her stepmother. This internal limit 
  is an integral part of the definition of the gift. See Re Robinson (1976), 15 
  O.R. (2d) 286 (Ont. H.C.). </p>
<p>
  [15] Even if the requirement to make payments to Mr. Noik's widow is a condition 
  subsequent, and not an internal limit on the definition of the gift, I still 
  would not find that it restrains his daughter's right to use and enjoy the property. 
  In Angus v. Angus Estate, [1989] 35 E.T.R. 170 (Ont. H.C.), the testator left 
  his residence to his second wife "absolutely" but stated that if she 
  sold the residence, she had to pay half the proceeds to their young son. Chadwick 
  J. held that the requirement to pay half the proceeds was not a restraint on 
  alienation, as the gift was intended to benefit both the wife and son. He observed 
  that the testator had made his concern for his son clear in other parts of the 
  will. See also Allen v. Allen, (1994) 2 E.T.R. (2d) 276 (Sask. Q.B.). </p>
<p> [16] Similarly, in this case there are other provisions in Mr. Noik's will 
  demonstrating his intention to care for the financial needs of his widow, including 
  her right to the matrimonial home.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> </p>
<p>
  [17] The daughter's duty to make payments to her stepmother does not unlawfully 
  restrain her right to use and enjoy the property. She is entitled to do as she 
  wishes with the properties, provided that in exchange for receiving them, she 
  pay $1,300 monthly to her stepmother during her lifetime. Read this way, the 
  testator's clear intention to benefit his daughter and his widow can be respected 
  and realized.</p>
<p>
  [18] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the motions judge, and 
  order that Klara Noik is entitled to $1,300 a month during her lifetime from 
  Mr. Noik's daughter. I would not order costs. </p>

<p><a name="a"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> In an earlier appeal about a different 
  provision of this same will, this court found that Mr. Noik bequeathed his entire 
  interest in the matrimonial home to his widow, not just a life interest. See 
  Noik v. Noik Estate, [2004] O.J. No. 1993 (C.A.). </p>
