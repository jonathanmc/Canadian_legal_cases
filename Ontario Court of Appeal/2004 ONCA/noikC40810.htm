<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Harry LaForme of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated September 24, 2003.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  GOUDGE J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] When Gordon Noik died on April 19, 2002, he resided with his wife, the 
  appellant, at 7 Townsgate Drive, Unit #303 in the City of Vaughan. He and the 
  appellant purchased that property as tenants in common in April 1992 and lived 
  there together until his death.</p>
<p>
  [2] Mr. Noik named his son, the respondent, as the executor of his Last Will 
  and Testament which he signed on July 19, 1994. The will contained this instruction 
  to his executor: </p>
<p class="indent">
  to pay or transfer to my wife, KLARA NOIK, during her lifetime, in the property 
  municipally known as 7 Townsgate Drive, Unit #303, City of Vaughan, Province 
  of Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant applied to the Superior Court for an interpretation of this 
  provision. The motions judge decided that it conveyed only a life interest in 
  the nature of a right of occupation to the appellant and that since the deceased 
  intended to give all of his real property interests to his two children, and 
  not to his wife, the deceased must have intended that his interest in the matrimonial 
  home be divided equally between his two children, subject only to the appellant's 
  life interest in the property.</p>
<p>
  [4] With respect, for the reasons that follow, I disagree with that conclusion. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] I begin with several points of agreement between the parties. First they 
  both say that the proper standard of review in this court is that of correctness. 
  I agree since the central issue is the interpretation of the wording of the 
  contested provision in the will. They also agree, as did the application judge, 
  that the deceased intended to dispose of all of his property and possessions 
  through his will, and did not intend that any of it be the subject of intestacy. 
  Again I concur. Finally the parties agree, correctly, that the words "my 
  interest" must be inserted in the disputed paragraph before the words "in 
  the property".</p>
<p>
  [6] However, in my view the will cannot be read to yield the interpretation 
  that the deceased intended to give all of his real property interests to his 
  two children and that they should therefore receive his residual interest in 
  the matrimonial home. While the will contains specific bequests of named properties 
  to each of the deceased's two children it also contains the disputed paragraph 
  that reflects an intention to convey some real property interest in the matrimonial 
  home to his wife, either a life interest as contended for by the respondent 
  or an absolute interest as contended for by the appellant. </p>
<p>
  [7] Apart from the disputed paragraph, the will does not specifically address 
  the deceased's interest in the matrimonial home at all, let alone divide it 
  between his two children. The latter result could be achieved only by reading 
  that concept into the will, not by interpreting its language.</p>
<p>
  [8] The question is not whether the deceased intended, through the disputed 
  paragraph, to give a life interest in the matrimonial home to his wife and, 
  if so, he must be taken to have disposed of his residual interest in that property 
  to his two children. The language of the will simply does not permit the latter 
  conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [9] Rather the question is to whom the deceased intended to bequeath his interest 
  in the matrimonial home. All agree, as do I, that the deceased intended to dispose 
  of his full interest in that property in his will.</p>
<p>
  [10] In my view he did so in the disputed paragraph, the only one which references 
  that interest. The phrase "during her lifetime" was used not to limit 
  his wife's interest to a life interest, but as one of the ways used by the deceased 
  in his will to indicate that his wife was to receive the interest in he conveyed 
  to her only if she survived him. For example, the deceased conveyed his personal 
  property to his wife, "if she survives me". And the residue of his 
  estate to her unless "his wife should predecease me."</p>
<p>
  [11] I conclude that the disputed provision conveys the full interest of the 
  deceased in the matrimonial home to the appellant because she survived him. 
  As contended for by the appellant, the words of this provision in the context 
  of the will as a whole yield this interpretation. </p>
<p>
  [12] On the other hand, the interpretation contended for by the respondent requires 
  the use of speculation rather than the words of the will to conclude that the 
  deceased intended his interest in the matrimonial home to go to his two children, 
  albeit subject to the appellant's life interest. </p>
<p>
  [13] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order below and order that the 
  appellant is entitled to the deceased's full interest in the matrimonial home.</p>
<p>
  [14] I would vary the costs order below to allow the appellant $3,000 payable 
  out of the estate.</p>
<p>
  [15] I would award costs of the appeal to the appellant in the same amount, 
  also payable out of the estate.</p>
