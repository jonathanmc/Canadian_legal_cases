<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>The Appeals and Cross-Appeal</p>
<p>
  [1] The Crown appeals against Old Colony on the issue of liability. Old Colony 
  appeals against Power Vac on the issue of liability. Power Vac cross-appeals 
  against Old Colony on the issue of damages.</p>
<p>
  [2] In our view, the appeals and cross-appeal are fact driven. The trial judge 
  gave thorough and comprehensive reasons for judgment. His findings of fact are 
  supported by the evidence and we see no basis for interfering with them or the 
  resulting legal conclusions.</p>
<p>
  Crown Appeal against Old Colony</p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge found as a fact that on July 16, 1997, Old Colony and the 
  Crown entered into an agreement whereby Old Colony "would pay for the asbestos 
  cleaning on condition that the [Crown] continued to pay rent" and its own 
  re-location expenses. The trial judge further found that Old Colony lived up 
  to its end of the bargain but that the Crown did not. Specifically, he determined 
  that the Crown's decision to stop paying rent to Old Colony on October 1, 1997 
  amounted to a unilateral and unjustifiable breach of the agreement. In that 
  regard, he effectively rejected the Crown's argument that the clean-up operation 
  performed by Power Vac on behalf of Old Colony was not carried out in a competent 
  or timely fashion. On the contrary, he was satisfied that in all of the circumstances, 
  Power Vac had performed its task with reasonable skill and diligence and that 
  Old Colony had accordingly lived up to its end of the bargain. As will be seen, 
  in the opinion of the trial judge, any further delays from October onward were 
  due to matters beyond Old Colony's control and for which the Crown bore responsibility.</p>
<p>
  [4] In our view, the findings of the trial judge are supported by the evidence 
  and they justify his conclusion that the Crown is liable to Old Colony for the 
  rent ($273,053.15) it unjustifiably withheld. </p>
<p>
  [5] We are also of the view that the trial judge was justified in finding the 
  Crown liable for the $131,000 spent by Old Colony in the final clean-up of the 
  building. Under the terms of the July 16, 1997 Agreement, Old Colony's commitment 
  to clean the building at its own expense must be interpreted in a commercially 
  reasonable fashion. In our view, such an interpretation excludes, as unrealistic, 
  the notion that Old Colony would bring the building into the "pristine/hospital-like" 
  condition demanded by the Union. Rather, it suggests a cleaning sufficient to 
  bring the building within the lesser standards required by the Ministry of Labour. 
  </p>
<p>
  [6] That standard was met on September 4, 1997 when Power Vac completed its 
  work. In the opinion of the trial judge, it was the intransigence of the Union 
  that necessitated the extensive re-cleaning that followed. That intransigence, 
  he found, was directly attributable to the Crown because of the Crown's failure 
  to comply with the regulations in the Occupational Health and Safety Act, as 
  required under the lease, and its failure to educate and train its employees 
  and contractors in accordance with the policy guidelines contained in its 'Asbestos 
  Manual'. </p>
<p>
  [7] According to the trial judge, had the Crown complied with its obligations, 
  "the contamination and the crises that followed would have been averted". 
  Instead, as he observed: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; the total removal costs were exacerbated considerably by the labour dispute 
  between the Tenant [the Crown] and its employees. The labour dispute was caused 
  by the Tenant's failure to properly educate its employees and contractors. Because 
  the employees and contractors were uneducated with respect to asbestos, they 
  caused the contamination by not following proper containment procedures, and 
  by taking inappropriate actions such as removing ceiling tiles. As such, the 
  Tenant breached the lease. Had the labour disruption not occurred, I have no 
  doubt that the asbestos cleanings/removals would not have been necessary. At 
  most, only one removal would have been necessary.</p>
<p>
  [8] Having found that the extensive re-cleaning needed to bring the building 
  into pristine condition was attributable to the Crown by virtue of its failure 
  to comply with the terms of the lease, as well as its own policy guidelines, 
  the trial judge concluded that the Crown should bear the cost of the re-cleaning. 
  In our view, he was entitled to come to that conclusion and we see no basis 
  for interfering with it.</p>
<p>
  [9] Accordingly, the Crown's appeal against Old Colony is dismissed with costs 
  fixed on a partial indemnity basis at $15,000 inclusive of disbursements and 
  GST.</p>
<p>
  The Appeal and Cross-Appeal between Old Colony and Power Vac</p>
<p>
  [10] The trial judge ordered Old Colony to pay the bulk of Power Vac's invoices 
  for the work Power Vac performed in removing the asbestos and cleaning the building. 
  The full amount claimed was reduced to reflect some expenses paid by Old Colony 
  to a third party for remedial work and certain extra expenses submitted by Power 
  Vac that the trial judge rejected as unauthorized. </p>
<p>
  [11] Old Colony appeals from that order on the basis that the trial judge ignored 
  and misapprehended evidence that showed that Power Vac was incompetent and that 
  it failed to adequately perform the cleaning contract for which it was hired. 
  </p>
<p>
  [12] We would not give effect to that submission. In our view, it was open to 
  the trial judge to find that Power Vac "substantially delivered what they 
  had promised" and that the "work done was reasonably within the 'scope 
  of work' contracted for". In support of those findings, the trial judge 
  quite properly took account of the fact that "the Power Vac work was tested 
  and passed by the MOL [Ministry of Labour] for re-entry on the 4th of September 
  1997". In addition, we note that after the Union engaged in its further 
  testing on September 9th, Power Vac was dismissed by Old Colony and not given 
  an opportunity to rectify the situation.</p>
<p>
  [13] As for Power Vac's cross-appeal, we have not been persuaded that the trial 
  judge failed to credit Power Vac for authorized work, nor did he deduct amounts 
  in respect of remedial work for which Power Vac was not responsible.</p>
<p>
  [14] In the result, Old Colony's appeal against Power Vac is dismissed with 
  costs fixed on a partial indemnity basis at $7,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements. 
  Power Vac's cross-appeal against Old Colony is dismissed with costs fixed on 
  a partial indemnity basis at $3,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
<p>
  Motion by Crown for Leave to Appeal Costs awarded against it in Power Vac v. 
  Old Colony Action</p>
<p>
  [15] The trial judge ordered the Crown "to pay the costs awarded on the 
  Power Vac v. Old Colony claim on a partial indemnity basis" [emphasis in 
  original]. He did so despite the fact that Power Vac's action for damages was 
  directed solely at Old Colony and did not include the Crown. </p>
<p>
  [16] Over the Crown's objections, the trial judge found that he had authority 
  to make the order under s. 131 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, C. 
  c. 43. He reasoned as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> In the present case, ORC [the Crown] was no stranger to the 
  action and had an interest in its outcome. It further involved itself when it 
  alleged, in its pleadings, that Power Vac was incompetent. ORC was not only 
  connected to the quarrel between Old Colony and Power Vac through Old Colony 
  but, was effectively the causa sine qua non of the litigation.</p>
<p class="indent">Both actions were, on consent, ordered to be tried together 
  and proceeded under a consolidated title of proceedings. </p>
<p class="indent">During the trial, all counsel were present and involved. The 
  trial of both actions was one proceeding before me with the evidence of any 
  one party binding on the others.</p>
<p>
  [17] Having concluded that he had the necessary authority, the trial judge made 
  the order for two reasons. First, he was of the view that "but for" 
  the conduct of the Crown, the litigation between Power Vac and Old Colony would 
  have been unnecessary. Second, he found that the Crown's failure to disclose 
  its "Asbestos Manual" in a timely fashion in its action with Old Colony 
  "impaired the litigation process" and amounted to "an abuse of 
  the disclosure process and the trial process in general".</p>
<p>
  [18] For reasons that follow, we need not finally resolve the jurisdiction issue. 
  Assuming that the trial judge had the authority to make the impugned order, 
  we are respectfully of the view that he erred in doing so.</p>
<p>
  [19] Old Colony chose to withhold payment from Power Vac and it forced Power 
  Vac to commence an action and prove its case. At the same time, in its action 
  against the Crown, Old Colony sought full indemnification for all of the costs 
  it incurred, including those to Power Vac, in removing the asbestos and cleaning 
  the building. </p>
<p>
  [20] Under the circumstances, it seems to us that the "but for" rationale 
  loses its force. The Crown had nothing to do with Old Colony's decision to withhold 
  payment from Power Vac and to defend Power Vac's action against it. That was 
  Old Colony's decision and in the end, Old Colony was proved wrong. In the circumstances, 
  it stands to reason that Old Colony should bear the costs of its own decision 
  to withhold funds and litigate.</p>
<p>
  [21] Likewise, we fail to see the link between Old Colony's decision to defend 
  Power Vac's action and the Crown's failure to disclose its 'Asbestos Manual'. 
  In our view, the two are unrelated.</p>
<p>
  [22] In the end, we believe that the impugned order constitutes an impermissible 
  attempt to punish the Crown and it cannot stand.</p>
<p>
  [23] Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and the 
  order requiring the Crown to pay Power Vac's costs is set aside. In its place, 
  an order will go requiring Old Colony to pay the costs in the same amount as 
  those awarded against the Crown. </p>
<p>
  [24] The Crown is entitled to its costs of the motion and the appeal against 
  Old Colony and Power Vac. Those costs, in total, are fixed on a partial indemnity 
  basis at $5,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
