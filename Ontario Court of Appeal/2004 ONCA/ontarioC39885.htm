<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellants, the Ontario Human Rights Commission and Ray Brillinger, 
  appeal the costs order of the Divisional Court dated December 11, 2002. Although 
  the court dismissed most of the appeal brought by the respondents, it awarded 
  costs of $25,000 in favour of the respondents against the OHRC, Brillinger and 
  Archives.</p>
<p>
  [2] Although costs orders are entitled to substantial deference, this particular 
  cost order simply cannot stand. We say this for several reasons.</p>
<p>
  [3] First, the respondent did not seek costs against Brillinger. In addition, 
  Brillinger was entirely successful on the appeal. Accordingly, there is no basis 
  for awarding costs against him.</p>
<p>
  [4] Second, the respondent's "material success" was on a single, minor 
  issue. Indeed, it is likely that the slight change in the tribunal's order by 
  the Divisional Court had no impact on the respondents' legal rights. At most, 
  the respondents' success was minuscule compared to the appellants' success on 
  all the other issues in the appeal. The Divisional Court erred in principle 
  in finding that the respondents achieved substantial success and founding its 
  cost order on that basis.</p>
<p>
  [5] As the successful parties, the OHRC and Brillinger are presumptively entitled 
  to their costs in the Divisional Court. We see no basis to award otherwise in 
  this case.</p>
<p>
  [6] Although Brillinger was represented by pro bono counsel, that should not 
  disentitle him to costs. The Divisional Court's reasons for denying costs ("the 
  funding for the pro bono work must come from somewhere, possibly from charity") 
  is not only pure speculation; it is also wrong - Brillinger's counsel informed 
  the court that he had taken the appeal on a pro bono basis, and without any 
  outside funding. The Divisional Court's concern about an uneven playing field 
  overlooks the problems created by refusing pro bono counsel the opportunity 
  of recovering some of their outlay. Such a policy would act as a severe penalty 
  to lawyers acting in the public interest by making it possible for litigants 
  of modest means to access the courts.</p>
<p>
  [7] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the Divisional Court 
  is varied to provide for costs to the OHRC on a partial indemnity basis fixed 
  at $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant Brillinger is also entitled to some costs, also on a partial 
  indemnity basis. However, those costs should be very modest indeed. The OHRC, 
  by statute, has carriage of a human rights complaint. A complainant is entitled 
  to appear as a party and be represented separately. However, this is more a 
  choice than a necessity. In this case, there is no suggestion that there was 
  a divergence of interest between the OHRC and Brillinger. Nor is there a suggestion 
  that the OHRC provided anything other than thoroughly competent presentation 
  of the appeal. Moreover, the respondents did not seek costs from Brillinger 
  in the Divisional Court and it would be unfair now to require them to pay costs 
  to Brillinger on an unreduced partial indemnity basis. In these circumstances, 
  the respondents should not have to pay two significant amounts of costs. We 
  fix Brillinger's costs before the Divisional Court at $5,000, inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
<p>
  [9] The OHRC and Brillinger are entitled to their costs of the appeal. In this 
  court, Brillinger and the Archives have an interest separate from the OHRC; 
  they are here challenging costs orders against them. Accordingly, both appellants 
  are entitled to their costs of the appeal fixed at $5,000, inclusive of disbursements 
  and GST.</p>
