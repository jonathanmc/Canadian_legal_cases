<p>On appeal from the judgments of Justice Lee K. Ferrier of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 4, 2003.</p>
<p>
  LANG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  Overview </p>
<p>
  [1] Orlando Corporation ("Orlando") appeals the trial judge's disposition 
  of costs in two proceedings that were heard together. The underlying litigation, 
  which involved liability for construction negligence on the Coast Paper Building 
  ("Coast") and the Cooper Lighting Building ("Cooper"), resulted 
  in a finding of negligence against Domtar Inc. ("Domtar"). However, 
  damages were reduced by ninety per cent as a result of the trial judge's finding 
  on Orlando's contributory negligence.</p>
<p>
  [2] Domtar served Offers to Settle in each of the two proceedings. The trial 
  judge, after considering those offers, granted Orlando partial indemnity costs 
  for both proceedings until September 2000 - the date of Domtar's Offers - and 
  granted Domtar partial indemnity costs thereafter. </p>
<p>
  Issues</p>
<p> [3] Orlando argues that the trial judge erred in law because: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the two offers should have been treated as separate offers, with the result 
    that Orlando would have obtained partial indemnity costs for both proceedings 
    to September 2000 and partial indemnity costs in the Cooper proceeding thereafter; 
    and</li>
  <li>Domtar's costs should have been reduced because its witness misled the court 
    on material matters.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Rules</p>
<p>
  [4] A trial judge's discretion with respect to costs is found in the Courts 
  of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43: </p>
<p class="indent">
  131.-(1) Subject to the provisions of an Act or rules of court, the costs of 
  and incidental to a proceeding or a step in a proceeding are in the discretion 
  of the court, and the court may determine by whom and to what extent the costs 
  shall be paid. </p>
<p>
  Generally, and absent offers to settle, a trial judge is guided by the principles 
  set out in rule 57.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194: </p>
<p class="indent">
  57.01 (1) In exercising its discretion under section 131 of the Courts of Justice 
  Act to award costs, the court may consider, in addition to the result in the 
  proceeding and any offer to settle or to contribute made in writing, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) the amount claimed and the amount recovered in the proceeding; 
</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) the apportionment of liability; </p>
<p class="indent"> (c) the complexity of the proceeding; </p>
<p class="indent"> (d) the importance of the issues; </p>
<p class="indent"> (e) the conduct of any party that tended to shorten or to lengthen 
  unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding; </p>
<p class="indent"> (f) whether any step in the proceeding was, </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) improper, vexatious or unnecessary, or </p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) taken through negligence, mistake or excessive caution; 
</p>
<p class="indent"> (g) a party's denial of or refusal to admit anything that should 
  have been admitted; </p>
<p class="indent"> (h) whether it is appropriate to award any costs or more than 
  one set of costs where a party, </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) commenced separate proceedings for claims that</p>
<p class="indent"> should have been made in one proceeding, or </p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) in defending a proceeding separated unnecessarily from 
  another party in the same interest or defended by a different solicitor; and 
</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) any other matter relevant to the question of costs. </p>
<p>
  [5] Where the defendant files an Offer to Settle, the following specific rule 
  encourages acceptance of reasonable settlements: </p>
<p class="indent"> 49.10 (2) Where an offer to settle [made by a defendant is 
  not accepted by the plaintiff]</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">and the plaintiff obtains a judgment as favourable as or less 
  favourable than the terms of the offer to settle, the plaintiff is entitled 
  to partial indemnity costs to the date the offer was served and the defendant 
  is entitled to partial indemnity costs from that date, unless the court orders 
  otherwise. </p>
<p>
  [6] In other words, unless the court orders otherwise, where the plaintiff subsequently 
  obtains a judgment that is less than or equal to the amount of the defendant's 
  offer, the plaintiff is only entitled to partial indemnity costs to the date 
  of the defendant's offer and the defendant is entitled to partial indemnity 
  costs thereafter.</p>
<p>
  Standard of Review</p>
<p>
  [7] As is evident from the above provisions, a trial judge has a broad discretion 
  in awarding costs. Unless that discretion was not exercised judicially, the 
  decision was based on an erroneous principle of law, or the costs award was 
  plainly wrong, an appeal court will not interfere. Appellate courts will be 
  more reluctant to reverse a trial judge on the question of costs where the analysis 
  is highly fact-driven: Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd., [2003] S.C.J. No. 
  72 at para. 27.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  1. Should the trial judge have treated the two offers separately?</p>
<p> [8] Domtar's September 2000 settlement offers and the trial judge's 2001 damages 
  awards were in the following amounts: </p>

<p>
  [9] Globally, Orlando obtained a judgment of a lesser amount than offered by 
  Domtar. Viewed separately, however, Orlando obtained a higher judgment than 
  Domtar's offer in the Cooper proceeding and a lower judgment than Domtar's offer 
  in the Coast proceeding. </p>
<p>
  [10] Accordingly, had the trial judge applied rule 49.10 separately to each 
  offer, Orlando would have been entitled to partial indemnity costs in both proceedings 
  to the date of Domtar's offers. Costs after the date of the offers would have 
  been divided: Orlando would have been entitled to partial indemnity costs in 
  the Cooper proceeding, and Domtar would have been entitled to post-offer costs 
  in the Coast proceeding. In the result, the post-offer costs would have cancelled 
  each other out, and Orlando would have received the only costs award. </p>
<p>
  [11] Instead, because the trial judge treated the two offers as a combined offer, 
  he awarded Orlando partial indemnity costs of both proceedings to the date of 
  the offers and Domtar partial indemnity costs of both proceedings thereafter. 
  In effect, the trial judge refused to give Orlando its post-offer costs of the 
  Cooper proceeding to which Orlando would have been entitled on a strict reading 
  of rule 49.10, and which would likely have relieved Orlando from the obligation 
  to pay any of Domtar's costs.</p>
<p>
  [12] The question is whether the trial judge exercised his discretion judicially 
  in deciding that this was a case to depart from the strict application of rule 
  49.10. Courts may only depart from a strict application of the Rules in exceptional 
  circumstances. As this court said in Niagara Structural Steel (St. Catherine's) 
  Ltd. v. W. D. Laflamme Ltd. (1987), 58 O.R. (2d) 773 (C.A.), at p. 777: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [R]esort should only be had to the exception where, after giving proper weight 
  to the policy of the general rule, and the importance of reasonable predictability 
  and the even application of the rule, the interests of justice require a departure.</p>
<p>
  [13] The trial judge considered the strict application of rule 49.10 and said 
  at paras. 16-18 of his reasons on costs: </p>
<p class="indent"> As has often been said, one of the underlying purposes of the 
  costs provisions in the rules is to encourage settlement thereby avoiding unnecessary 
  proceedings. As noted above, the result of the application of rule 49.10 to 
  each of the offers in this case would be to award Domtar its cost from September 
  15, 2000 forward, and award Orlando its costs from September 15, 2000 forward, 
  likely producing a wash. This in turn would leave Orlando with its costs up 
  to September 15, 2000. Without more in my judgment, this would be an unfair 
  result in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="indent">Although the strict application of rule 49.10 would produce 
  the result above noted, in my view the spirit of rule 49.10 ought to be applied 
  in the circumstances and Domtar should have the advantage of having made two 
  offers which, if both had been accepted, would have ended the matter. I note 
  that nowhere in its submissions does Orlando give any reason why it could not 
  have accepted both offers.</p>
<p class="indent">Accordingly, exercising the discretionary power of this court, 
  it would be my view that Orlando should have its costs of both proceedings to 
  September 15, 2000, on a partial indemnity scale, and thereafter, Domtar should 
  have its costs of both actions on the same scale.</p>
<p>
  [14] In my view, this was a proper exercise of the trial judge's discretion. 
  He was entitled, under rule 49.10, to decide that this was an appropriate circumstance 
  "to order otherwise". He was in the best position to weigh the offers 
  and the circumstances surrounding the offers, to determine whether this was 
  the exceptional case where the court should depart from a strict application 
  of rule 49.10. Indeed, the trial judge's reasons demonstrate his appreciation 
  for the objectives of rule 49.10 to "encourage settlement thereby avoiding 
  unnecessary proceedings."</p>
<p>
  [15] There is no error in the trial judge's reasoning on this issue.</p>
<p>
  [16] Having decided not to apply rule 49.10 strictly, the trial judge was entitled 
  to turn to the general principles set out in rule 57.01 which, as he noted in 
  para. 14 of his reasons on costs, specifically allowed him to consider "the 
  result in the proceeding and any offer to settle ... made in writing&#133;". 
  The trial judge decided, in all the circumstances of this lengthy and costly 
  trial, that it would be in error to award all costs to Orlando.</p>
<p> 2. Should Domtar's Costs Have Been Reduced Because its Witness Misled the 
  Court? </p>
<p>
  [17] Costs may be reduced or disallowed for misconduct of the parties either 
  before or during litigation: rule 57.01(1)(e).</p>
<p>
  [18] Dr. Booth, a scientist with Domtar and one of its chief witnesses, conducted 
  testing in his in?house capacity and, as an "expert", gave evidence 
  of those earlier tests at trial. Dr. Booth was not an expert witness in the 
  traditional sense of being an outside consultant retained after the events to 
  provide an opinion as to their cause. Orlando submits that Domtar should be 
  entirely deprived of costs because Dr. Booth "allegedly attempt[ed] to 
  mislead the court on material matters and [failed] to disclose relevant evidence" 
  (para. 19, reasons on costs). </p>
<p>
  [19] The trial judge considered Dr. Booth's conduct in his reasons for judgment. 
  To say the least, the trial judge was unimpressed with Dr. Booth's evidence. 
  He referred to it as "most unsatisfactory" and found that Dr. Booth 
  failed to disclose certain information, even withholding important information 
  from Domtar's lawyers. The trial judge found him to be a partisan witness, one 
  who "was on the scene in a major way as a Domtar employee" (para. 
  297, trial reasons). While the trial judge found that "for the most part, 
  Dr. Booth put aside his partisanship when giving his evidence", he also 
  found that he did "make serious mistakes &#133; in not being forthright" 
  (para. 298, trial reasons). Further, at paras. 299-301 and 309, the trial judge 
  found,</p>
<p class="indent"> I note that much of Dr. Booth's evidence is corroborated by 
  physical evidence including photographs and documents. Further, the critical 
  aspect of the chemistry of corrosion was soundly addressed by Dr. Rudin. The 
  expert opinion of David Scott concerning air leakage, which I have accepted, 
  is based in part on Dr. Booth's evidence as to his observations - but they, 
  in turn, are supported by photographs - and Mr. Scott made his own inspections. 
</p>
<p class="indent">In short, I do not accede to the plaintiff's submission that 
  I should reject Dr. Booth's evidence in its entirety to the extent that it supports 
  the defendant's position. </p>
<p class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> I am satisfied that all the &#133; experts with whom Dr. Booth 
  communicated were completely independent and the findings in their report were 
  not, taking into account all the evidence, falsified or inappropriately altered.</p>
<p class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> Much of Dr. Booth's evidence is corroborated by documents, 
  physical evidence and other witnesses. I am therefore unable to accede to the 
  plaintiff's submissions that I should reject any part of his evidence which 
  tends to assist Domtar.</p>
<p>
  [20] In those circumstances, the trial judge did not see Dr. Booth's conduct 
  as the type of partisanship on the part of an expert which, in another case, 
  might require the court's sanction exercised by depriving the relevant party 
  of their costs. Instead, while noting he had made negative findings concerning 
  Dr. Booth's credibility, the trial judge preferred to characterize the conduct 
  not as misconduct per se, but as conduct that "lengthened somewhat the 
  duration of the trial" (para. 24, reasons on costs). Again, this finding 
  regarding the effect of Dr. Booth's conduct on the trial is entitled to deference 
  by this court.</p>
<p>
  [21] The trial judge considered whether to reduce Domtar's costs in light of 
  Dr. Booth's prolongation of the trial. In doing so, he looked at other factors 
  at paras. 25-26: </p>
<p class="indent"> A further consideration must be taken into account. It is the 
  fact that in pursuing its claims at trial, Orlando sought approximately $1,850,000 
  in damages. It was awarded approximately $160,000. This is a factor that may 
  be taken into account under rule 57.01 (1)(a).</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, the apportionment of liability is relevant under 
  sub-para. (b) of rule 57.01 (1). In my view, both these considerations would 
  result in a substantial reduction in the costs awarded to Orlando.</p>
<p>After considering all these factors, he found at para. 27: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [I]t is my view that the fairest and most appropriate result is to not reduce 
  Orlando's recovery and not reduce Domtar's recovery.</p>
<p>
  [22] In deciding this question, the trial judge was entitled to balance Domtar's 
  conduct under rule 57.01 (1)(e) against Orlando's conduct under 57.01 (1)(a) 
  and (b) and come to his conclusion with respect to the allocation of costs. 
  In doing so, the trial judge did not, as argued by Orlando, improperly "double 
  count" for Orlando's obvious lack of success having regard to the finding 
  that it was ninety per cent responsible for the resulting damages. First, the 
  trial judge did not, as in the cases referenced by Orlando, make the error of 
  reducing Orlando's costs by ninety per cent because it was ninety per cent contributorily 
  negligent. See Hogan v. Italian Mosaic and Tile Co., [1927] O.J. No. 5 (S.C. 
  (H.C.Div.)); J.W. Faux Ltd. v. Ontario Hydro, [1996] O.J. No. 2816 (Ct.J. (Gen.Div.)); 
  Capital Community Credit Union Ltd. v. BDO Dunwoody, [2001] O.J. No. 61 (S.C.J.). 
  Second, the trial judge was entitled to take into account Orlando's minimal 
  success both in his determination of the disposition of costs and in his determination 
  of the quantum of those costs.</p>
<p>
  [23] The trial judge was in the best position to assess the effect of Dr. Booth's 
  conduct and whether it warranted a response by the court. He was entitled to 
  consider Dr. Booth and Domtar's conduct in light of all the other circumstances 
  and to decide that the most equitable solution would be not to reduce costs 
  for either party. </p>
<p>
  Result</p>
<p>
  [24] The trial judge judicially exercised his discretion to award costs and 
  made no error in principle. The appeals are dismissed.</p>
<p>
  Costs</p>
<p>
  [25] With respect to the costs of this appeal, brief written submissions may 
  be made in that regard within thirty days of the release of this decision.</p>
