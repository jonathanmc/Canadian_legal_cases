<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Clair Marchand of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated March 11, 2003.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>[1] This an appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Marchand dated March 18, 
  2002, dismissing the plaintiffs&#146; action on the basis of a finding of no 
  liability against the defendants. The action arose as a result of an incident 
  in which two persons were shot and killed and another injured by an unknown 
  assailant as they were coming out of the front door of a nightclub in a strip 
  mall in the early morning hours of July 27, 1997. </p>
<p>[2] The action was framed in tort and was brought on behalf of the family members 
  of one of the murdered victims alleging a breach of the Occupier&#146;s Liability 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.2, by the owners of the strip mall and of the nightclub. 
  The action raised the issue of responsibility for security at nightclubs including 
  the absence of an organized security system or policy which, the appellants 
  argue, would have alerted the respondent to times of increased danger and which 
  would have acted as an overall deterrent to criminal acts. The action also raised 
  the issue of whether the obligation of the respondent nightclub as an occupier 
  of property to take reasonable care to see that persons on the property are 
  reasonably safe extends to and includes the parking lot.</p>
<p>[3] The trial judge&#146;s reasons must be read as finding no duty on the respondents 
  to take reasonable care for the safety of patrons in the parking lot. On this 
  issue the trial judge is in error and the respondent concedes that the obligation 
  to take reasonable care to see that persons on its property are reasonably safe 
  extends to their use of the parking lot when leaving.</p>
<p>[4] The standard of care required of the respondent depends on the harm that 
  is reasonably foreseeable for patrons in the parking lot. In his reasons, at 
  para. 18, the trial judge finds that even if the respondent nightclub is subject 
  to a duty of care, the standard of care does not extend to hiring security guards 
  or off duty police officers to patrol outside the club at closing time. Absent 
  an error in principle, that finding is entitled to deference in this court. 
  In Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at para. 37, the Supreme Court 
  stated:</p>
<p class="indent">In our view&#133;the determination of whether or not the standard 
  of care was met by the defendant involves the application of a legal standard 
  to a set of facts, a question of mixed fact and law. This question is subject 
  to a standard of palpable and overriding error unless it is clear that the trial 
  judge made some extricable error in principle with respect to the characterization 
  of the standard or its application, in which case the error may amount to an 
  error of law.</p>
<p>[5] The appellants submit that the trial judge did err in principle because 
  he failed to assess the reasonable foreseeability of harm at closing time. The 
  appellants argue that the respondent nightclub acted unreasonably by bringing 
  its security guards inside the club at closing, and that, had the trial judge 
  properly characterized the standard of care, he would have concluded that the 
  respondent had breached its duty of care. </p>
<p>[6] On a fair reading of para. 18 of the trial judge&#146;s reasons, we incline 
  to the view that he did not err in principle in either his characterization 
  or application of the standard of care. However, even if we accept the appellants&#146; 
  submission that he did so, their appeal must fail on the question of causation.</p>
<p>[7] Causation is established where a plaintiff proves on a balance of probabilities 
  that the defendant caused or contributed to the injury: Snell v. Farrell, [1990] 
  2 S.C.R. 311 and Cottrelle v. Gerrard, [2003] O.J. No. 4194 (C.A.).</p>
<p>[8] The trial judge found that this shooting was unprovoked and indiscriminate, 
  in other words, that it was a random shooting and that nothing the nightclub 
  might reasonably have done would have prevented it. This finding is amply supported 
  by the evidence. For example, the record discloses that the identity of the 
  shooter was unknown, that no one knew whether the shooter had had any connection 
  to the mall or the nightclub and that no one knew whether the shooter had any 
  connection to the victim. Further, Detective Mendelson, a senior and experienced 
  officer with the Toronto police force, testified that investigations of homicides 
  at similar clubs showed that the presence of uniformed officers did not prevent 
  murders from occurring. </p>
<p>[9] Nonetheless, the appellants argue that the presence of uniformed guards 
  outside of the front door creates an atmosphere that diminishes the risk of 
  violence. Although there is no evidence specifically addressing this, it may 
  be that the deterrent effect of a uniform can be taken as a given. Nonetheless, 
  to demonstrate causation the plaintiffs have to go beyond a diminished risk 
  and demonstrate that in this case the failure to provide uniformed guards outside 
  the front door of the club (assuming that to be the standard of care) caused 
  the killing.</p>
<p>[10] In other words, to find causation established, the evidence of reduced 
  risk created by the presence of a uniform would have to be coupled with a factual 
  inference drawn by the trial judge, namely, that the failure to provide uniforms 
  in this case caused or contributed to the killing. That is, this failure made 
  the killing more likely that not.</p>
<p>[11] That finding was not made in this case. While it can be said that the 
  trial judge did not approach it quite this way, his reasons leave no doubt of 
  his conclusion: that nothing the respondent could have done would have either 
  prevented or made less likely the killing. This finding (which requires deference) 
  is insuperable if the appellants are to demonstrate the necessary causation.</p>
<p>[12] For these reasons, despite Ms. Tough&#146;s able argument, we would dismiss 
  the appeal, with costs if demanded, fixed at $10,000.00. </p>
