<p>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Justice Edward F. Then, Justice

  at 62 O.R. (3d) 709. </p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] This is an important appeal for government taxing authorities and non-profit 
  charitable organizations in Ontario. The appeal relates to a statutory exemption 
  from property tax for charitable institutions. The exemption, in paragraph 12 
  of s. 3(1) of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. A.31, is for: </p>
<p class="indent">
  12. Land owned, used and occupied by,</p>
<p class="center"> . . . </p>
<p class="indent"> iii. any charitable, non-profit philanthropic corporation organized 
  for the relief of the poor if the corporation is supported in part by public 
  funds.</p>
<p>
  The appeal concerns the interpretation of the word "occupied" in this 
  provision.</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  (1) The parties and events</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent Ottawa Salus Corporation ("Salus") is a charitable 
  corporation which provides housing and support services for people in Ottawa 
  who are mentally ill and unemployed. Salus owns eight buildings in Ottawa which 
  it uses to house such people. Some of the buildings function as group homes, 
  others as apartment buildings.</p>
<p>
  [3] This appeal relates to two of Salus' properties - the apartment building 
  at 214 Flora Street and the apartment building at 225 Lebreton Street. The Flora 
  Street property has six living units; the Lebreton Street property has fourteen. 
  The residents of these buildings do not share bedrooms. The Lebreton Street 
  property has a staff office, a common room and a common kitchen. The smaller 
  Flora Street property has only a staff office, but since it is in close proximity 
  to the Lebreton Street property, its residents share the common room and common 
  kitchen located there.</p>
<p>
  [4] In 1995, the Ontario Ministry of Health issued a directive that required 
  Salus and other organizations which provide special needs housing to deliver 
  the housing under the provisions of the Tenant Protection Act, S.O. 1997, c. 
  24, in order to provide security of tenure to the disabled. As a result of this 
  requirement, every resident of the Flora Street and Lebreton Street buildings 
  signs a lease with Salus for his or her unit.</p>
<p>
  [5] For many years, all of the buildings that Salus used for housing were exempt 
  from property tax. The relevant provision in those years was the former paragraph 
  12 of s. 3 of the Assessment Act (now paragraph 12 of s. 3(1) of that Act) which 
  framed an exemption for charitable organizations in terms of "when the 
  land is owned by the institution and occupied and used for the purposes of the 
  institution." In 1998, this provision was amended to "land owned, 
  used and occupied by" the charitable organization.</p>
<p>
  [6] In 2001, the appellant Municipal Property Assessment Corporation ("MPAC") 
  assessed many of Salus' properties as taxable. The basis for the assessment 
  was MPAC's view that the 1998 amendment had narrowed the exemption in paragraph 
  12 by requiring that the charitable institution must itself occupy the subject 
  premises; occupation by others, albeit for the purposes of the charitable institution, 
  was no longer sufficient to trigger the exemption.</p>
<p>
  (2) The litigation</p>
<p>
  [7] Pursuant to s. 46 of the Assessment Act, Salus brought an application seeking 
  exemptions for three of its Ottawa properties, including the Flora Street and 
  Lebreton Street properties. On June 25, 2002, Polowin J. rendered her judgment: 
  reported at 61 O.R. (3d) 597. She held that one of the properties was exempt 
  due to a 'grandfathered' exemption. With respect to the Flora Street and Lebreton 
  Street properties, the application judge held that the parts of the buildings 
  used by Salus - the office in the Flora Street property and the office, common 
  room and common kitchen in the Lebreton Street property - were exempt. However, 
  the residential units used by the disabled and unemployed persons were not exempt.</p>
<p>
  [8] Under paragraph 12 of s. 3 of the previous version of the Assessment Act, 
  the residential units in the two buildings had been exempt because, while they 
  were not occupied by Salus, they were occupied "for the purposes" 
  of Salus in that Salus' very purpose was to provide housing for the types of 
  residents who lived in its buildings.</p>
<p>
  [9] The application judge held that the 1998 amendment to the exemption changed 
  this picture. The amendment required Salus itself to occupy the buildings in 
  order to benefit from the exemption: this Salus did not do. Indeed, pursuant 
  to the terms of Salus' leases with the residents of the buildings, it was the 
  residents who had exclusive occupation rights to their units. Accordingly, the 
  application judge concluded that Salus did not occupy the buildings and that 
  as a result they were not exempt from property taxation.</p>
<p>
  [10] Salus appealed. On December 23, 2002, the Divisional Court (Then, Cusinato 
  and Cumming JJ.) allowed the appeal: reported at 62 O.R. (3d) 709. The court 
  stated that the word "occupy" is not limited in its ordinary meaning 
  to physical occupation, and concluded that there was a sufficient link between 
  the residents of the properties (disabled and unemployed homeless people) and 
  Salus' charitable objectives to permit Salus to receive the exemption.</p>
<p>
  [11] MPAC appeals the Divisional Court's decision.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUE</p>
<p>
  [12] The sole issue on appeal is: did the Divisional Court err in its interpretation 
  of the word "occupied" in paragraph 12 of s. 3(1) of the Assessment 
  Act?</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [13] The appellant advances three main arguments in support of its position 
  that the Divisional Court erred in its interpretation of the word "occupied" 
  in paragraph 12 of s. 3(1) of the Assessment Act: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (1) at a general level, the Divisional Court erred by not recognizing that exemptions 
  in taxation statutes must be strictly interpreted so as not to undercut the 
  central purpose of revenue laws, the obtaining of revenue for use by governments 
  for public purposes; </p>
<p class="indent"> (2) more specifically, the Divisional Court erred by concluding 
  that the 1998 amendment to the provision did not narrow the scope of the exemption; 
  and </p>
<p class="indent"> (3) the Divisional Court erred by not following decisions of 
  this court. </p>
<p>
  I will deal with these submissions in turn.</p>
<p>
  (1) The interpretation of taxation statutes</p>
<p>
  [14] MPAC contends that exemptions in taxation statutes must be strictly interpreted 
  and that the Divisional Court "misinterpret[ed] the legislation by stating 
  that exemption, rather than assessment and taxation, was the overall intent 
  and purpose of the Assessment Act" (factum, paragraph 21).</p>
<p>
  [15] I disagree. The leading case dealing with the interpretation of taxation 
  laws in the context of exemptions from property tax for charitable organizations 
  is Queb&eacute;c (Communaut&eacute; Urbaine) v. Corp. Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours, 
  [1994] 3 S.C.R. 3 ("Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours"). In that case, Gonthier 
  J., speaking for a unanimous court, and relying on earlier decisions of the 
  court in Stubart Investments Ltd. v. The Queen, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 536, and The 
  Queen v. Golden, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 209, specifically rejected the proposition 
  that taxation laws, including provisions creating exemptions, should be strictly 
  construed. He observed, at p. 18: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; I should like to stress that it is no longer possible to apply automatically 
  the rule that any tax exemption should be strictly construed. It is not incorrect 
  to say that when the legislature makes a general rule and lists certain exceptions, 
  the latter must be regarded as exhaustive and so strictly construed. That does 
  not mean, however, that this rule should be transposed to tax matters so as 
  to make an absolute parallel between the concepts of exemption and exception. 
  With respect, adhering to the principle that taxation is clearly the rule and 
  exemption the exception no longer corresponds to the reality of present-day 
  tax law. Such a way of looking at things was undoubtedly tenable at a time when 
  the purpose of tax legislation was limited to raising funds to cover government 
  expenses. In our time it has been recognized that such legislation serves other 
  purposes and functions as a tool of economic and social policy. By submitting 
  tax legislation to a teleological interpretation it can be seen that there is 
  nothing to prevent a general policy of raising funds from being subject to a 
  secondary policy of exempting social works. Both are legitimate purposes which 
  equally embody the legislative intent and it is thus hard to see why one should 
  take precedence over the other.</p>
<p>
  [16] In my view, the reasons of the Divisional Court are consistent with this 
  approach. The court acknowledged that "Salus must affirmatively establish 
  that its property falls within the four corners of the exempting provision", 
  but noted as well that "the legislative intent and purpose of the exemption 
  must also be kept in mind."</p>
<p>
  (2) The 1998 amendment - did it narrow the exemption?</p>
<p>
  [17] MPAC's principal submission is that the 1998 amendment significantly narrowed 
  the exemption from taxation for charitable institutions. It contends that the 
  application judge correctly interpreted the new exemption provision when she 
  said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The amendments made to section 3, paragraph 12 were significant and made the 
  test for the exemption more restrictive.&#133;[T]he applicant must own, use 
  and occupy the premises. It is no longer sufficient for an applicant to simply 
  own the land and ensure that the property is occupied and used according to 
  its stated purposes [emphasis in original]. </p>
<p>
  [18] In contrast, the appellant submits, the Divisional Court erred when it 
  concluded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The real property of Salus that is the subject of the assessment is "occupied" 
  by Salus in the sense that it is controlled, held and employed by Salus as the 
  necessary prerequisite and means to fulfil its charitable mandate. The land 
  is used solely for the charitable purposes of Salus; without the land, it would 
  be impossible for Salus to fulfil its charitable purposes. The fact of physical 
  occupation by each tenant of a given rental unit does not detract from the fact 
  that the land as an entirety is "occupied by" Salus in the carrying 
  on of its charitable business or activity. Indeed, the only way that Salus can 
  carry out the very core purpose of its charitable mandate is to have the rental 
  units in its building [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [19] I think it useful to set out the full language of the former paragraph 
  12 of s. 3 and the current paragraph 12 of s. 3(1) of the Assessment Act. </p>
<p>
  [20] The pre-1998 version of the exemption read: </p>
<p class="indent">
  12. Land of an incorporated charitable institution organized for the relief 
  of the poor, The Canadian Red Cross Society, St. John Ambulance Association, 
  or any similar incorporated institution conducted on philanthropic principles 
  and not for the purpose of profit or gain, that is supported, in part at least, 
  by public funds, but only when the land is owned by the institution and occupied 
  and used for the purposes of the institution [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [21] The current version of the exemption reads: </p>
<p class="indent">
  12. Land owned, used and occupied by,</p>
<p class="indent"> i. The Canadian Red Cross Society,</p>
<p class="indent"> ii. The St. John Ambulance Association, or</p>
<p class="indent"> iii. any charitable, non-profit philanthropic corporation organized 
  for the relief of the poor if the corporation is supported in part by public 
  funds [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [22] Although the structure and wording of the two provisions are quite different, 
  it would appear that the 1998 amendment changed the substance of the paragraph 
  in two respects: (1) it removed the exemption for institutions that are "similar" 
  to charitable institutions organized for the relief of the poor; and (2) it 
  replaced the wording "land&#133;owned by the institution and occupied and 
  used for the purposes of the institution" with "land owned, used and 
  occupied". The parties agree that there is nothing in the legislative record, 
  including the debates in the Legislature or proceedings in committees, nor in 
  any other source, such as an external report or study, to indicate why the provision 
  was amended in 1998. </p>
<p> [23] The general principles regarding the interpretation of tax legislation 
  were summarized by Gonthier J. in Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours, supra, at p. 20: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li> The interpretation of tax legislation should follow the ordinary rules 
    of interpretation;</li>
  <li> A legislative provision should be given a strict or liberal interpretation 
    depending on the purpose underlying it, and that purpose must be identified 
    in light of the context of the statute, its objective and the legislative 
    intent: this is the teleological approach;</li>
  <li> The teleological approach will favour the taxpayer or the tax department 
    depending solely on the legislative provision in question, and not on the 
    existence of predetermined presumptions;</li>
  <li> Substance should be given precedence over form to the extent that this 
    is consistent with the wording and objective of the statute;</li>
  <li> Only a reasonable doubt, not resolved by the ordinary rules of interpretation, 
    will be settled by recourse to the residual presumption in favour of the taxpayer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [24] Applying these principles, the starting point is an examination of (1) 
  the general purpose of the Assessment Act and (2) the purpose of the the specific 
  exemption claimed by the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [25] The general purpose of the Assessment Act is obvious. It is expressed in 
  s. 3(1) of the Act: "All real property in Ontario is liable to assessment 
  and taxation". In Canadian Mental Health Association v. Ontario Property 
  Assessment Corporation, [2002] O.J. No. 2199 at para. 42 (S.C.), Kozak J. described 
  the purpose of s. 3(1) as follows: "to impose upon all real property in 
  Ontario a general obligation to pay a property tax so that the government can 
  meet its expenditures."</p>
<p>
  [26] However, this purpose is not an absolute one. Section 3(1) expressly provides 
  that the general purpose is "subject to the following exemptions from taxation". 
  Twenty-nine exemptions follow, including exemptions for churches, public education 
  institutions, public hospitals, houses of refuge, charitable institutions, small 
  theatres and large non-profit theatres. Many of the organizations listed in 
  the exemption paragraphs perform activities which are of great benefit to either 
  discrete groups of disadvantaged persons or to society as a whole. Exemption 
  from property tax allows these organizations to spend more of their limited 
  resources on those activities. The clear implication of these exemptions is 
  that while there is a substantial public interest in the generation of revenue 
  through the taxation of real property, in the context of the real property covered 
  by these exemptions, that public interest is outweighed by the public interest 
  in giving relief from property taxation to certain organizations.</p>
<p>
  [27] The specific purpose of sub-paragraph 12(iii) of s. 3(1) of the Act is 
  to grant relief from property taxation to non-profit corporations "organized 
  for the relief of the poor" because the public interest in granting these 
  organizations additional resources to relieve poverty outweighs the public interest 
  in generating revenue through the taxation of property.</p>
<p>
  [28] Against the backdrop of this purpose, I am of the view that the Divisional 
  Court's interpretation of the word "occupied" in paragraph 12 is correct, 
  and is to be preferred over the application judge's narrower interpretation. 
  There are two features of the Divisional Court's interpretation which, taken 
  together, create a balanced and just interpretation of the exemption. The expansive 
  feature of the interpretation is the court's rejection of a definition that 
  would require Salus itself to occupy the residential units in order to receive 
  an exemption. However, that feature is linked to an important limiting feature. 
  The exemption applies only to land that is used directly by a charity in carrying 
  out its charitable work. As explained by the court: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The statutory pre-conditions of the land having to be "owned, used and 
  occupied" by the charity serve the purpose of ensuring that the exemption 
  is limited to land being used directly by the charity in carrying out its charitable 
  activity. The tax expenditure subsidy, extended in the public interest, must 
  be circumscribed such as to be directed only at the charitable activity recognized 
  and approved by the Legislature.</p>
<p>
  See also: Vancouver (City) v. Coast Foundation (1974) (1990), 2 M.P.L.R. (2d) 
  148 at 154 (B.C.S.C., per Callaghan J. defining occupation in terms of "providing 
  services to that site within the purposes and mandate of the organizational 
  structure") aff'd (1991) 6 M.P.L.R. (2d) 311 (B.C.C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [29] Finally, I note that two exemptions in s. 3(1) of the Assessment Act are 
  framed in terms of land "occupied solely by" (paragraph 4 - public 
  educational institutions, and paragraph 5 - philanthropic organizations). If 
  the Legislature had intended to limit the exemption for a charitable institution 
  (paragraph 12) to land occupied exclusively by the charity itself, the language 
  of "occupied solely by" could have been employed.</p>
<p>
  (3) Case authorities</p>
<p>
  [30] MPAC contends that the Divisional Court's decision is inconsistent with 
  a line of decisions which enunciates the proposition that the establishment 
  by a charity of a tenancy relationship ousts the charity as an "occupant" 
  of the land being used by the tenant: see Maple Leaf Services v. Townships of 
  Essa and Petawawa, [1963] 1 O.R. 475 (C.A.) ("Maple Leaf Services"); 
  First Place, Hamilton v. City of Hamilton (1979), 9 M.P.L.R. 119 (Ont. H.C.J.) 
  ("First Place, Hamilton"); and Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph 
  of Cornwall, Ontario v. Regional Assessment Commissioner, Region 1(1998), 42 
  O.R. (3d) 539 (C.A.) ("Religious Hospitallers").</p>
<p>
  [31] I do not agree with MPAC's submission. In Maple Leaf Services, the relevant 
  relationship was licensor and licensee, not landlord and tenant. In First Place, 
  Hamilton, Goodman J. held that the exemption in the former paragraph 12 of s. 
  3 of the Assessment Act did not apply to a church which leased land to tenants 
  for office and retail commercial uses. Similarly, in Religious Hospitallers, 
  this court held that land leased by a charitable institution to other charitable 
  institutions was not eligible for an exemption. McKinlay J.A. said, at p. 543: 
  "To qualify for an exemption, it would be necessary for Cornwall to show 
  that the rented premises were used for its charitable purposes, not the charitable 
  purposes of some other institution" [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [32] The Divisional Court distinguished these cases in this fashion: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [I]n each case the tenants were third parties who had no connection with the 
  charity. In contrast, in the instant case the "tenants" are the very 
  persons for which the charity exists. The residents in the units, owned and 
  used by the appellants, are at the very core of the charitable purposes of the 
  appellants which is the provision of low cost housing for the poor and the mentally 
  ill.</p>
<p>
  I agree with this reasoning, although with the caveat that its application to 
  Maple Leaf Services is somewhat tangential.</p>
<p>
  (4) Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [33] Section 3(1) of the Assessment Act grants an exemption from property tax 
  to: </p>
<p class="indent">
  12. Land owned, used and occupied by: </p>
<p class="center"> . . . </p>
<p class="indent"> iii. any charitable, non-profit philanthropic corporation organized 
  for the relief of the poor if the corporation is supported in part by public 
  funds.</p>
<p>
  [34] MPAC properly acknowledges that Salus owns the subject properties, is a 
  charitable non-profit philanthropic corporation, and is supported in part by 
  public funds. The Divisional Court found that the two properties are "used 
  solely for the charitable purposes of Salus." The appellant does not contest 
  this finding.</p>
<p>
  [35] Salus properly acknowledges that its tenants "occupy" their residential 
  units at the two properties pursuant to their leases and the Tenant Protection 
  Act. </p>
<p>
  [36] The remaining question is whether, for the purposes of the exemption, Salus 
  also occupies the residential units in its buildings. For the reasons set out 
  in the previous section, I would answer this question in the affirmative. Occupation 
  for purposes of the exemption does not require actual or exclusive occupation 
  by the charitable institution. If the subject property is being used directly 
  by the charity in furtherance of its objective of relieving the poor, that constitutes 
  occupation within the meaning of paragraph 12 of s. 3(1) of the Assessment Act. 
  In my view, this interpretation is consistent with the principles of interpretation 
  for taxation statutes enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Notre-Dame 
  de Bon-Secours.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [37] I would dismiss the appeal. The respondent is entitled to its costs of 
  the appeal, on a partial indemnity basis, which I would fix at $5000 inclusive 
  of disbursements and GST.</p>
