<p>On appeal from the summary conviction appeal judgment of Justice James A. Fontana 
  dated January 29, 2003, setting aside the conviction entered by Justice of the 
  Peace Veronica M. Carmichael on July 2, 2002.</p>
<p> GILLESE J.A.: </p>
<p> [1] Chandrago Paul Seenanan earns his living as a taxi driver. After picking 
  up a fare one evening, he was charged with the offence of "licensed taxicab 
  driver operate[s] unlicensed taxicab". He pleaded guilty with an explanation 
  and was fined. After hearing about a case similar to his own, that had been 
  dismissed, he launched an appeal. On hearing Mr. Seenanan's appeal, Justice 
  Fontana set aside the conviction and entered a verdict of not guilty. The City 
  of Ottawa appeals from that judgment.</p>
<p> [2] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p> BACKGROUND</p>
<p> [3] Mr. Seenanan is a taxi driver. Before January 1, 2001, he was licensed 
  by the former City of Gloucester. As such, he was entitled to pick up fares 
  in Gloucester and drop them off within the former City of Ottawa but he was 
  not entitled to pick up fares within the former City of Ottawa. </p>
<p> [4] Effective January 1, 2001, the City of Ottawa Act, 1999, S.O. 1999, c.14 
  ("the Act"), created a new City of Ottawa ("the new City") through the amalgamation 
  of 12 former municipalities, including Gloucester and the former City of Ottawa. 
  The former municipalities were dissolved pursuant to s. 5(1) of the Act. </p>
<p> [5] As a result of By-law 2001-516, passed by the new City, Mr. Seenanan was 
  obliged to comply with new licensing requirements. He satisfied all of the new 
  requirements, at considerable personal expense, including payment of substantially 
  higher licensing fees and upgrading his taxicab to a more recent model. </p>
<p> [6] He obtained a license from the new City. His licensing fees are paid to 
  the new City and inspections of his vehicle are carried out by the new City.</p>
<p> [7] Thereafter, on June 30, 2002, in an area that is acknowledged to be within 
  the old City of Ottawa boundaries, he stopped and picked up a fare. According 
  to submissions that Mr. Seenanan made to Justice of the Peace Carmichael, after 
  dropping off a fare at about one o'clock in the morning, he saw two women standing 
  at the side of the road trying to flag down a cab. One of the women appeared 
  to be very drunk and was being sick on the road. He said that he saw cabs pass 
  by the women without stopping and that he picked them up because he felt sorry 
  for them.</p>
<p> [8] Shortly after Mr. Seenanan picked up the fare, a by-law enforcement officer 
  stopped him and issued a Certificate of Offence. The Certificate of Offence 
  states that he is charged with the offence of: "Licensed taxicab driver operate[s] 
  unlicensed taxicab" contrary to "City of Ottawa By-Law 2001-515, s. 42(2)".</p>
<p> [9] Mr. Seenanan, acting on his own behalf, entered a guilty plea with an 
  explanation at Provincial Offences Court. Justice of the Peace Carmichael reduced 
  the set fine of $455 to $150.00 plus the victim surcharge after Mr. Seenanan 
  explained the circumstances. No prosecutor was present for the City during Mr. 
  Seenanan's appearance before the Justice of the Peace. </p>
<p> [10] Approximately three months later, Mr. Seenanan learned that a similar 
  case had gone to trial and been dismissed for reasons upon which he felt he 
  was entitled to rely. He obtained an order extending the time to file an appeal.</p>
<p> [11] On appeal, Justice Fontana found in favour of Mr. Seenanan. He set aside 
  the conviction and entered a verdict of not guilty.</p>
<p> [12] Justice Fontana reasoned as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> &#133; the respondent city's position gives rise to the effect 
  that even though taxi operators have an obligation to comply and conform with 
  the new requirements imposed by amalgamation, they are not, as yet, entitled 
  to the benefit of such compliance - that is to say, accepting "pick-up" fares 
  within that area which was the "old" City of Ottawa.</p>
<p class="indent">It cannot have been contemplated that applying s. 5(6) of the 
  Act in this manner would bring about a result that is fundamentally inequitable 
  and unfair.</p>
<p class="indent">Nor can the section be taken to shield the "new" City of Ottawa 
  from its obligation to update the taxi licencing by-law to conform to the realities 
  of amalgamation.</p>
<p class="indent">Section 5(2) of the Act is clear when its says: "The City stands 
  in the place of the old municipalities for all purposes" &#133; [emphasis in 
  the original]</p>
<p class="indent">The old pre-amalgamation taxi zones have been dissolved and 
  are no longer in existence. The charge, therefore, cannot stand.</p>
<p> [13] The new City obtained leave to appeal. It argues that, as a result of 
  s. 5(6) of the Act, the licensing by-laws of the former cities of Gloucester 
  and Ottawa continue in force. Consequently, the new City argues, the geographical 
  limitations contained in the licensing by-laws apply to prevent Mr. Seenanan 
  from lawfully picking up fares in the old City of Ottawa. </p>
<p> [14] Section 5(6) reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Every by-law or resolution of an old municipality that is in 
  force on December 31, 2000 shall be deemed to be a by-law or resolution of the 
  city council on January 1, 2001 and remains in force, in respect of the part 
  of the municipal area to which it applied on December 31, 2000, until it expires 
  or is repealed or amended to provide otherwise. 1999, c. 14, Sched. E, s. 5(6).</p>
<p> Amendment Of The Certificate Of Offence</p>
<p> [15] The City seeks, for the first time, to have the Certificate of Offence 
  amended to "reflect the proper nomenclature of the Licensing By-law L6-2000".<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  It says that a "more appropriate wording" on the Certificate of Offence would 
  show that Mr. Seenanan was charged under licensing By-law L6-2000, Schedule 
  19, s. 42(2). It notes that the wording of the offence, as set out on the Certificate 
  of Offence, is consistent with s. 42(2) and argues that in light of the broad 
  and curative amendment provisions contained in the Provincial Offences Act, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33, the Certificate of Offence ought to be amended on appeal. 
</p>
<p> [16] It will be recalled that the Certificate of Offence states that Mr. Seenanan 
  is charged with the offence of "Licensed taxicab driver operate[s] unlicensed 
  taxicab" contrary to "City of Ottawa By-Law 2001-515, s. 42(2)".</p>
<p> [17] By-law 2001-515 amends By-law L6-2000 of the old City of Ottawa. It was 
  enacted and passed, by the new City, on December 12, 2001. By-law 2001-515 does 
  not contain a s. 42(2) nor does it contain offence provisions. </p>
<p> [18] Section 6(1) of By-law L6-2000 provides that: </p>
<p class="indent"> No person shall, within the limits of the City, carry on or 
  engage in any of the trades, callings, businesses or occupations described in 
  Section 2 hereof until he or she has procured a license so to do.</p>
<p> [19] Taxicab drivers are listed as one of the groups in s. 2 that requires 
  a license. "City" is defined as the "City of Ottawa".</p>
<p> [20] Section 42(2), in Schedule 19 to By-law L6-2000, stipulates that: "No 
  licensed taxicab driver shall operate a taxicab which is not licensed pursuant 
  to this by-law."</p>
<p> [21] The City argued that this court has jurisdiction to grant the requested 
  amendment pursuant to s. 34 of the Provincial Offences Act. The respondent took 
  no issue with this submission. Sections 34(1) and (4), set out below, provide 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 34.(1) The court may, at any stage of the proceeding, amend 
  the information as may be necessary if it appears that the information or certificate,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) fails to state or states defectively anything that is requisite 
  to charge the offence;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) does not negative an exception that should be negatived; 
  or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) is in any way defective in substance or in form.</p>
<p class="center"> . . . . .</p>
<p class="indent"> (4) The court shall, in considering whether or not an amendment 
  should be made, consider,</p>
<p class="indent"> (a) the evidence taken on the trial, if any;</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) the circumstances of the case;</p>
<p class="indent"> (c) whether the defendant has been misled or prejudiced in 
  the defendant's defence by a variance, error or omission; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (d) whether, having regard to the merits of the case, the proposed 
  amendment can be made without injustice being done.</p>
<p> [22] In my view, despite able arguments from counsel for the City, a consideration 
  of the factors set out in s. 34(4) militates against making the amendment. </p>
<p> Section 34(4)(a) - The Evidence Taken on Trial</p>
<p> [23] Section 34(4)(a) requires the court to consider the evidence taken on 
  trial. There is no such evidence because there was no trial. The record before 
  this court consists of Mr. Seenanan's submissions to the Justice of the Peace, 
  the submissions of both parties to the summary conviction appeal justice and 
  those legislative provisions upon which the City wishes to rely. There is no 
  evidence relating to either Mr. Seenanan's license or the licensing status of 
  his taxicab. The face of Mr. Seenanan's actual license, which was handed to 
  the court at the hearing of this appeal, shows that he possesses a license from 
  "the City of Ottawa". There is nothing on it to suggest that he is limited to 
  driving in a particular geographical zone. There is no evidence relating to 
  the process by which Mr. Seenanan applied for and obtained a license from the 
  City of Ottawa. The City maintains that Mr. Seenanan is licensed by the former 
  municipality of Gloucester while Mr. Seenanan says he is licensed by the new 
  City. Similarly, there is no evidence about the taxicab that Mr. Seenanan was 
  driving on the night in question. Was it licensed or not? If it was licensed, 
  by whom, to whom and under what by-law or by-laws? This absence of evidence 
  weighs heavily in an assessment of the other considerations, as will be seen. 
  Its significance is magnified when considered in context - Mr. Seenanan is charged 
  with a quasi-criminal offence and it is the City that bears the burden of proof. 
</p>
<p> Section 34(4)(b) - The Circumstances of the Case </p>
<p> [24] Section 34(4)(b) requires a consideration of "the circumstances of the 
  case". In my view, three aspects of the circumstances of this case are significant. 
  The first relates to the record, which is far from complete. As already noted, 
  there is virtually no evidence. Moreover, as discussed below, the record does 
  not appear to contain all relevant legislative provisions. In the face of a 
  seriously incomplete record, this court is asked to determine the validity of 
  s. 5(6) of the Act. It is tantamount to being asked to rule on a hypothetical 
  case, something this court has repeatedly declined to do and for good reason. 
  See, for example, Gonyou v. Nova Chemicals [2001] O.J. No. 2093 (C.A.). </p>
<p> [25] The second aspect relates to the proposed amendment itself. At its core, 
  the proposed amendment is flawed because it does not make clear the provisions 
  that Mr. Seenanan is said to be breaching. Based on both the wording of the 
  offence on the Certificate of Offence and the City's factum, the City appears 
  to accept that Mr. Seenanan is a licensed taxicab driver. The offence must, 
  therefore, relate to the taxicab that Mr. Seenanan was driving on the night 
  in question. The existing Certificate of Offence does not set out the provisions 
  that relate to the licensing of a taxicab. We were referred to s. 6(1) of By-law 
  L6-2000 but that section stipulates that a person requires a license to carry 
  on certain trades in Ottawa; no issue is taken with the fact that Mr. Seenanan 
  is a licensed taxicab driver. Other provisions must be relied upon to create 
  the offence of driving an unlicensed cab. We have not been advised as to what 
  those provisions are and they do not form part of the motion for amendment. 
  I must confess that I cannot see why this court would permit an amendment, at 
  this late stage in the proceedings, for the stated purpose of bringing it into 
  conformity with the nomenclature on the Certificate of Offence. If an amendment 
  is to be granted at this stage of the proceeding, subject to considerations 
  of prejudice, surely it would be to make the charge conform to the evidence 
  or to clarify the precise provisions that the respondent is said to be contravening. 
</p>
<p> [26] For example, in R. v. Lorenzo, [2002] O.J. No. 4850 (Ont. C. J.), the 
  prosecution successfully sought an amendment at the close of its case in order 
  to bring the offence as charged into conformity with the evidence. The amendment 
  changed the offence provision from s. 140(1)(a) of the Highway Traffic Act, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 to s. 144(7) of that Act. Several factors led to the conclusion 
  that an amendment was warranted: the defence still had the opportunity to respond 
  to the charge, as amended; there was a finding that the defendant had not been 
  misled; and, any prejudice suffered could be easily remedied by an adjournment. 
  In the case before this court, as discussed below, the respondent would be denied 
  a meaningful opportunity to respond and the prejudice that would be occasioned 
  cannot be remedied. </p>
<p> [27] The third aspect relates to the state of the City's licensing by-laws. 
  The City has chosen to enact a series of by-laws in the name of the dissolved 
  municipalities rather than to enact city-wide requirements. This sort of patchwork 
  approach leads to confusion that is not clarified by the record. No explanation 
  of the licensing regime and how it has been changed appears on the record. It 
  was not before the summary conviction appeal justice. In fact, the City representative 
  advised Justice Fontana that the City licensing by-laws had not been amended. 
  At page 8 of the transcript, the City representative said this: </p>
<p class="indent"> Which to date, none of the taxi by-laws have been amended or 
  appealed since amalgamation. </p>
<p> [28] However, at the time that Mr. Seenanan was charged, the City had made 
  significant amendments to both the former City of Ottawa's By-law L6-2000 and 
  the former City of Gloucester's By-law No. 41 of 1998 by means of by-laws 2001-515 
  and 516. </p>
<p> [29] The legislative provisions before the court raise numerous questions 
  for which the record offers no answers or even suggested solutions. These include: 
</p>
<p class="indent"> a) What by-law or by-laws govern the licensing of Mr. Seenanan 
  as a driver and his taxicab? Did the new City amend them? </p>
<p class="indent">b) The Act dissolved the former municipalities but the new City 
  passed by-laws 2001 - 515 and 516 as if the former municipalities of Gloucester 
  and Ottawa had not been dissolved. What effect does such action by the new City 
  have on the pre-existing licensing by-laws, if any? Does it matter that such 
  activity appears inconsistent with the purpose of the Act, which was to create 
  a single municipality? </p>
<p> Section 34(4)(c)-Misled or Prejudiced</p>
<p> [30] Section 34(4)(c) directs the court to consider whether Mr. Seenanan was 
  misled or prejudiced in his defence by the errors or omissions. In my view, 
  he was both misled and prejudiced. The respondent was misled because his defence 
  in the court below was conducted on the basis that he was accused of having 
  violated s. 42(2) of By-law 2001-515. In the face of a conflict between the 
  wording of the offence on the Certificate of Offence and the legislative provisions 
  referred to, Mr. Seenanan based his arguments before Justice Fontana on the 
  inequity that arose from requiring him to comply with the licensing regime imposed 
  by the new City while preventing him from taking the benefit of such compliance. 
  Justice Fontana disposed of the matter on that basis.</p>
<p> [31] In addition, counsel for Mr. Seenanan raised a new issue before this 
  court that calls into question the validity of the City's licensing regime. 
  He notes that By-law 2001-515 exempts licensed taxicab drivers from the former 
  municipality of Vanier from the application of the former City of Ottawa's licensing 
  by-laws with the result that former Vanier drivers are free to pick up fares 
  in the former City of Ottawa while former Gloucester drivers are not. Relying 
  on the cases of R. v. Sharma, [1993] S.C.J. No. 18 and Montreal (City of) v. 
  Arcade Amusements Inc., [1985] S.C.J. No. 16, he argues that the effect of the 
  City's new licensing regime is discriminatory and that the by-law is, therefore, 
  invalid. The discrimination, he says, arises either from 1) the unequal treatment 
  of the two groups of taxicab drivers, or 2) the fact that all Ottawa taxicab 
  drivers are required to conform to standardized requirements but separate classes 
  of work opportunities are maintained with reference to boundaries of now dissolved 
  municipalities. As the Certificate of Offence did not make clear the legislative 
  provisions upon which the City intended to rely, Mr. Seenanan was prejudiced 
  in being unable to advance such an argument in the earlier stages of this proceeding. 
</p>
<p> Section 34(4)(d) -- Injustice </p>
<p> [32] Section 34(4)(d) directs the court to consider any injustice that would 
  be done by the making of the amendment. In the circumstances of this case, to 
  permit the amendment at this time would be to expose Mr. Seenanan to a different 
  charge than that which he faced in the courts below, a clear injustice. In addition, 
  the City submits that specific procedures and limitations apply when municipal 
  by-laws are challenged. It follows that this court might be precluded from entertaining 
  Mr. Seenanan's challenge to the validity of the City's licensing regime in the 
  context of this appeal. To permit the City to amend so that it could rely on 
  different legislative provisions in the face of the clear possibility that the 
  respondent would be unable to challenge the validity of such legislation would 
  also be an injustice. </p>
<p> [33] Accordingly, I would dismiss the motion to amend the Certificate of Offence.</p>
<p> CONCLUSION</p>
<p> [34] There is no s. 42(2) in By-law 2001-515 nor does By-law 2001-515 contain 
  any offence provisions. Moreover, while there is evidence before this court 
  that Mr. Seenanan is a licensed taxicab driver, there is no evidence before 
  this court that he drove an "unlicensed" taxicab. On the record before us, I 
  see no error in the result below and I would dismiss the appeal. </p>
<p> [35] In light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider the validity 
  of s. 5(6) of the Act. Moreover, in my view, there is an insufficient record 
  before the court to make such a determination. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>[36] If the parties are unable to agree on the matter of costs, they may make 
  brief written submissions on the same within 15 days of the release of these 
  reasons.</p>

  "I agree R. S. Abella J.A."</p>
<p> </p>
<p> GOUDGE J.A.: (Dissenting)</p>
<p> [37] I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of my colleague 
  Gillese J.A., which ably outline the background and circumstances relevant to 
  this appeal. However, with great respect, I would reach a different conclusion. 
  For the reasons that follow, I would allow both the amendment to the Certificate 
  of Offence and the appeal and would restore the conviction.</p>
<p> THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT</p>
<p> [38] The Certificate of Offence given to the respondent on the night of the 
  alleged offence charged him with "Licensed Taxicab Driver Operate Unlicensed 
  Taxicab contrary to City of Ottawa By-law 2001-515 s. 42(2)." The Certificate 
  alleges that the offence took place at 400 Dalhousie Street in Ottawa on June 
  30, 2002. The essence of the offence charged is that at the time and place specified, 
  the respondent, a licensed taxicab driver, operated a taxicab that was not properly 
  licensed.</p>
<p> [39] The amendment sought by the appellant would change the Certificate of 
  Offence to provide that this conduct was contrary to By-law L6-2000 Schedule 
  19, s. 42(2) rather than By-law 2001-515 s. 42(2). The respondent takes no issue 
  with the appellant's assertion that the former is an offence provision, and 
  I am prepared to proceed on that basis. It reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 42.(2) No licensed taxicab driver shall operate a taxicab which 
  is not licensed pursuant to this by-law.</p>
<p> [40] The by-law referred to in the Certificate of Offence, By-law 2001-515, 
  was passed by the new City of Ottawa after amalgamation. It amends By-law L6-2000 
  in various respects concerning the regulation of the taxicab industry. It does 
  not however, contain either a s. 42(2) or a section describing the offence with 
  which the respondent was charged.</p>
<p> [41] By-law L6-2000, which it amends, was passed originally by the old City 
  of Ottawa. It regulated a wide variety of businesses in the old City, including 
  the taxicab industry. Schedule 19 to that By-law dealt specifically with the 
  licensing of taxicab drivers and taxicabs in the old City. At amalgamation, 
  that By-law became a by-law of the new City by reason of s. 5(6) of the City 
  of Ottawa Act, 1999, S.O. 1999, c.14 (the Act).</p>
<p> [42] In my view a number of considerations favour allowing the amendment. 
  First, with the proposed amendment, the Certificate of Offence more accurately 
  describes the offence charged, namely that on June 30, 2002 at 400 Dalhousie 
  Street, the respondent, being a licensed taxi driver, operated a taxicab which 
  is not licensed pursuant to L6-2000, the By-law under which taxicabs are licensed 
  for operation in the area that was the old City. </p>
<p> [43] Second, this description conforms to the respondent's understanding of 
  the charge against him when he appeared before the Justice of the Peace. He 
  made clear then that his taxicab was issued with blue plates which allowed him 
  to pick up in what was the old City of Gloucester but not at 400 Dalhousie Street 
  in what was the old City of Ottawa, and that he would need a red plate for his 
  taxicab to pick up in that area. The respondent clearly understood the charge, 
  namely that his taxicab was not licensed to pick up at 400 Dalhousie Street 
  in what was the old City of Ottawa. </p>
<p> [44] Third, the respondent pleaded guilty at first instance. He did not challenge 
  the allegation in the Certificate of Offence that he operated a taxicab which 
  was not licensed to operate on June 30, 2002 at 400 Dalhousie Street in the 
  old City of Ottawa. Hence there was no need for evidence. This explains the 
  absence of evidence about, for example, who licensed the respondent's taxicab 
  or under what bylaw. </p>
<p> [45] Fourth, the respondent does not suggest that there is any evidence that 
  he would have called if he had been facing the amended Certificate at first 
  instance. Nor does his factum suggest that his plea would have been different. 
  Nor does he argue that if the amendment is not allowed, the appeal should be 
  dismissed because the Certificate of Offence is defective. Indeed, the amendment 
  is sought by the appellant not in response to any challenge to the Certificate 
  of Offence by the respondent, but merely "to provide for the appropriate nomenclature 
  of licensing By-law L6-2000". In argument, the only prejudice pointed to by 
  the respondent was the cost of counsel to respond to the appeal. Our jurisdiction 
  to award costs pursuant to s. 139(3) of the Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c.P.33 would seem to be the complete answer to this concern. In short, 
  the proposed amendment would cause no prejudice that cannot be remedied.</p>
<p> [46] Finally, the proposed amendment does not adversely affect this Court's 
  ability to address the merits of this appeal. As Carthy J.A. said in granting 
  leave, the proper meaning to be given to s. 5(6) of the Act is a question of 
  broad importance. In my view, we should answer it if we can.</p>
<p> [47] In summary, I do not think that the respondent has been misled or prejudiced 
  by the proposed amendment. The change can be made without injustice and in the 
  circumstances of this case it should, in my view, be allowed.</p>
<p> THE MERITS OF THE APPEAL</p>
<p> [48] The merits of this appeal turn on the proper interpretation of s. 5(6) 
  of the Act. It reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 5.(6) Every by-law or resolution of an old municipality that 
  is in force on December 31, 2000 shall be deemed to be a by-law or resolution 
  of the city council on January 1, 2001 and remains in force, in respect of the 
  part of the municipal area to which it applied on December 31, 2000, until it 
  expires or is repealed or amended to provide otherwise.</p>
<p> [49] In the judgment appealed from, Fontana J. appears to have concluded that, 
  despite s. 5(6), amalgamation dissolved the old pre-amalgamation taxi zones 
  such as the old City of Gloucester and the old City of Ottawa. As a result, 
  he allowed the appeal because in his view, the respondent could no longer be 
  barred from operating in the old City of Ottawa. </p>
<p> [50] In my view Fontana J. erred in doing so. The effect of s. 5(6) is to 
  deem By-law L6-2000 (passed by the old City of Ottawa) to be a by-law of the 
  new City of Ottawa and to remain in force in respect of the part of the municipal 
  area to which it applied before amalgamation. That area, namely what was the 
  old City of Ottawa, includes 400 Dalhousie Street. The respondent was therefore 
  was prohibited by s. 42(2) of Schedule 19 of that By-law from picking up a passenger 
  in the area of the old City of Ottawa unless his taxicab was licensed pursuant 
  to By-law L6-2000. By his guilty plea the respondent acknowledged that his taxicab 
  was not licensed under this By-law. Nor has he suggested either before Fontana 
  J. or in this court that his taxicab was or is licensed under By-law L6-2000.</p>
<p> [51] While it is unnecessary to determine for this appeal, it appears that 
  his taxicab is licensed under By-law 41 of 1998 of the old City of Gloucester 
  which is also now a by-law of the new City of Ottawa because of s. 5(6) of the 
  Act. It regulates the taxicab industry in the area of the new City that was 
  the old City of Gloucester. This By-law has been amended by the new City of 
  Ottawa by By-law 2000-516 which inter alia sets age standards for taxicabs. 
  It appears that the new City has applied these standards throughout the new 
  City by amending in like manner the taxicab by-law of each old municipality 
  which amalgamated into the new City. All of these taxi by-laws also became by-laws 
  of the new City pursuant to s. 5(6) of the Act. </p>
<p> [52] As a result, it appears that the respondent's taxicab is now licensed 
  by the new City of Ottawa pursuant to By-law 41 of 1998 of the old City of Gloucester 
  to operate within the area of the new City of Ottawa that was formerly Gloucester. 
  As well, the respondent has been forced by By-law 2001-516 to comply with the 
  age of vehicle standards set by the new City of Ottawa. </p>
<p> [53] While this appears to explain the by-law under which the respondent's 
  taxicab is licensed, what matters for this case is that the respondent's taxicab 
  was not licensed under By-law L6-2000. It could therefore not be operated on 
  June 30, 2002 at 400 Dalhousie Street in what was the old City of Ottawa because 
  s. 5(6) of the Act makes s. 42(2) of Schedule 19 of that By-law applicable to 
  that area of the new City of Ottawa. </p>
<p> [54] The respondent raises three arguments to the contrary. First he says 
  that the appellant has imposed a series of city-wide requirements (for example 
  on vehicle age) by amending the old taxi by-laws of the municipalities that 
  were amalgamated by the Act. He argues on the one hand that by legislating in 
  this way rather than enacting one city wide by-law the appellant has ignored 
  one of the central purposes of amalgamation namely the creation of one big city. 
  He argues on the other hand that by imposing city wide standards the appellant 
  has in effect created one big city wide taxi zone and cannot rely on the old 
  bylaws to "punish" the respondent.</p>
<p> [55] I disagree. This argument ignores the fact that s. 5(6) of the Act deems 
  those old by-laws to be by-laws of the new City of Ottawa so that the appellant 
  has created city-wide safety standards simply by amending its own by-laws. It 
  also ignores the fact that s. 5(6) deems those by-laws in force in respect of 
  the areas to which they applied before amalgamation, in each case the area of 
  the former municipality. The new City was entitled to act as it did in creating 
  city-wide standards, former municipality by former municipality. However, by 
  doing so the new City did not remove the requirement that to operate in the 
  area of the old City a taxicab must be licensed pursuant to By-law L6-2000.</p>
<p> [56] In passing, it can be noted that s. 5(6) of the Act provides that each 
  old by-law remains in effect in respect of its part of the new City until it 
  expires, is repealed or is amended to provide otherwise. There is no suggestion 
  in this case that By-law L6-2000 has expired or been repealed or been amended 
  to provide that it does not apply to its particular part of the new City. </p>
<p> [57] Second, the respondent argues that s. 5(2) of the Act which provides 
  that "the city stands in the place of the old municipalities for all purposes" 
  provides him with a defence. He says that since his taxicab is licensed by the 
  new City of Ottawa he is entitled to operate as if he were licensed by the old 
  City of Ottawa. </p>
<p> [58] Again, I disagree. Section 5(2) does not mean that whenever the new City 
  of Ottawa issues a taxicab license that license must allow operations throughout 
  the new City. This would negate s. 5(6) which continues the old by-laws for 
  those areas of the new City to which they each applied before amalgamation, 
  not to the whole of the new City. Only if the new City issues a taxicab license 
  under by-law L6-2000 can it be operated lawfully within that area of the new 
  City that was the old City. A taxicab license issued by the new City pursuant 
  for the taxicab by-law of the old Gloucester (which is now a by-law of the new 
  City) does not give the holder any such right. </p>
<p> [59] Finally, the respondent argues that the new City's licensing structure 
  is discriminatory because it now permits taxicabs licensed to operate in the 
  area of the old municipality of Vanier to pick up in the area of the old City 
  unlike those licensed to operate in the area of the old Gloucester.</p>
<p> [60] The simple answer to this is found in R. v. Sharma, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 650 
  (S.C.C.) where on behalf of the court Iacobucci J. said this at p. 667: </p>
<p class="indent"> I agree with Arbour J.A. that this case is governed by the 
  decision of this Court in Montr&eacute;al (City of) v. Arcade Amusements Inc., 
  supra with respect to the discrimination in the by-law scheme. In that case, 
  the Court held that the power to pass municipal by-laws does not entail that 
  of enacting discriminatory provisions (i.e., of drawing a distinction) unless 
  in effect the enabling legislation authorizes such discriminatory treatment. 
  See also Rogers, The Law of Canadian Municipal Corporations (2nd ed. 1971), 
  at pp. 406.3-406.4: </p>
<p class="indent10"> It is a fundamental principle of municipal law that by-laws 
  must affect equally all those who come within the ambit of the enabling enactment. 
  Municipal legislation [page 668] must be impartial in its operation and must 
  not discriminate so as to show favouritism to one or more classes of citizens. 
  Any by-law violating this principle so that all the inhabitants are not placed 
  in the same position regarding matters affected by it is illegal.</p>
<p class="indent10">The general principle does not apply where the enabling statute 
  clearly specifies that certain persons or things may be excepted from its operation 
  or expressly authorizes some form of discrimination.</p>
<p> [61] Here any distinction between taxicabs licensed pursuant to the taxi by-law 
  of the former Gloucester and those licensed pursuant to the taxicab by-law of 
  the former Vanier is expressly authorized by s. 5(6) of the Act which makes 
  them applicable to that part of the new City to which they applied before amalgamation 
  and authorizes the new City to amend any one of them to provide otherwise. The 
  new City has done so with respect to the latter.</p>
<p> [62] I therefore conclude that s. 5(6) of the Act makes By-law L6-2000 applicable 
  to the area that was the old City of Ottawa, and since the respondent's taxicab 
  was not licenced to operate under that By-law he was properly convicted.</p>
<p> [63] In summary, therefore, for these reasons, I would allow the amendment 
  and the appeal and restore the conviction.</p>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> I will assume for the purpose of this
