<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Robert A. Riopelle of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated February 14, 2003.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] Part of a utility pole erected by the appellant, the Corporation of the 
  Town of Hearst ("Hearst"), fell off during a windstorm. It struck 
  a van being driven by the respondent, Fabien Ouellette. Ouellette was injured. 
  Following an eleven day trial, Justice Robert A. Riopelle found Hearst liable 
  in negligence and fixed damages of $562,800.</p>
<p>
  [2] Hearst appeals on a number of grounds, including the trial judge's ruling 
  permitting two doctors to give opinion evidence, his assessment of Ouellette's 
  credibility in relation to his injuries, and the correctness of his analysis 
  on the issue of negligence. However, the two principal issues on appeal relate 
  to the trial judge's conclusion that the limitations in ss. 284(2) and (3) of 
  the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, did not bar Ouellette's action against 
  the town.</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  (1) The parties and the events</p>
<p>
  [3] In November 1996, Hearst suspended a small banner across Highway 11 (its 
  main street) as part of its 75th anniversary celebration. This banner was taken 
  down in 1997. In early 1998, a promotional banner for a 'Challenge Canada' skidoo 
  race was installed. The banner was suspended across the highway from two utility 
  poles which Hearst had erected in the road allowance, one on each side of Highway 
  11. The poles were secured by steel wires known as 'guy wires'. A steel cable 
  ran from the top of one pole to the top of the other. The top edges of the banner 
  were tied to the cable; the bottom edges were tied to the poles with nylon rope.</p>
<p>
  [4] February 17, 1998 was a very windy day in Hearst. The nylon rope tying the 
  banner to the south utility pole detached from the pole and dangled near the 
  centre of Highway 11.</p>
<p>
  [5] At approximately 1:00 p.m., Fabien Ouellette was travelling in the eastbound 
  lane and Richard Bergeron was driving westbound in a vehicle owned by his employer, 
  Villeneuve Construction Company Limited ("Villeneuve Construction"). 
  Both drivers noticed the nylon rope dangling a few feet from the ground. Bergeron 
  moved to the right to avoid the rope. The rope struck the driver's side mirror, 
  which turned in and struck the door of his vehicle. Bergeron immediately pulled 
  over to adjust the mirror.</p>
<p>
  [6] The top of the utility pole on the south side of the highway snapped off. 
  It was approximately 28 feet in length. It fell toward the highway and struck 
  the roof of Ouellette's van. Ouellette's left side hit the van door and his 
  left knee struck the steering column or wheel. Ouellette drove away from the 
  accident. He finished his shift at the town's lumber mill, where he worked as 
  a stack operator.</p>
<p>
  (2) The litigation</p>
<p>
  [7] On June 17, 1998, Ouellette delivered written notices to Hearst, Bergeron 
  and Villeneuve Construction advising that he intended to sue for damages for 
  personal injuries as a result of the accident. Ouellette issued a Statement 
  of Claim on October 25, 1999, approximately twenty months after the accident. 
  The action against all three defendants was framed in negligence.</p>
<p>
  [8] The trial judge found that Bergeron reacted as a reasonable prudent driver 
  would in the circumstances of the accident. As a consequence, he held that Bergeron 
  and his employer, Villeneuve Construction, were not negligent.</p>
<p>
  [9] With respect to Hearst, the trial judge rejected its contention that Ouellette's 
  action against the town was barred by the limitations set out in ss. 284(2) 
  and (3) of the Municipal Act.</p>
<p>
  [10] On the merits, the trial judge concluded that "Ouellette has not succeeded 
  in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the dangling rope had anything 
  to do with or was a proximate cause of the accident."</p>
<p>
  [11] The trial judge then turned to a consideration of whether Hearst was negligent 
  in the erection and use of the utility pole that had snapped and fallen onto 
  Ouellette's van. He reasoned: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Cyprien Lachance had passed by on his grader an hour before the accident. He 
  noticed that the pole on the South side of the highway was swaying in the wind. 
  He was concerned that it might fall and so he asked his dispatcher to alert 
  Hearst before an accident occurred. He felt that, even though it was windy that 
  day, the pole was moving more than one would expect if the guy wire were still 
  attached. He did not see a rope dangling from the banner at that time.</p>
<p>
  Bergeron testified that an hour later it was still very windy and the post was 
  still shaking in the wind. Other evidence also indicates that this was an [un]usually 
  windy day. Wind alone, however, does not break off the top of utility poles. 
  Maybe: </p>
<p class="indent">
  a) this banner was too heavy;</p>
<p>
  b) it caught too much wind;</p>
<p>
  c) the pole was deficient; or</p>
<p>
  d) the guy wire, like the rope at the bottom of the banner, had detached</p>
<p>
  or several of these items acting concurrently were the proximate causes of this 
  accident.</p>
<p>
  Ouellette does not have to show why the pole broke but only that it could not 
  have done so without negligence on Hearst's part. Hearst has not met the evidentiary 
  burden of rebutting that presumption. The evidence satisfies Ouellette's legal 
  burden of establishing negligence on a balance of probabilities: this installation 
  was insecure and so Hearst was negligent.</p>
<p>
  [12] The trial judge then reviewed the evidence and concluded that the accident 
  had caused injuries to Ouellette's back and left knee. He assessed damages at 
  $562,800 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  a) general damages $ 110,000</p>
<p>
  b) past loss of income $ 78,800</p>
<p>
  c) future loss of income $ 320,000</p>
<p>
  d) past loss of household services $ 9,000</p>
<p>
  e) future loss of household services to2015 $ 20,000</p>
<p>
  f) future loss of household services from2016 onwards $ 25,000</p>
<p>[13] Hearst appeals the trial judge's decision.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [14] The issues on appeal are: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (1) Did the trial judge err by failing to conclude that the respondent's action 
  was precluded by s. 284(3) of the Municipal Act?</p>
<p>
  (2) Did the trial judge err by failing to conclude that the respondent's action 
  was barred by the three month limitation period in s. 284(2) of the Municipal 
  Act?</p>
<p>
  (3) Did the trial judge err by reversing the onus and imposing a burden on the 
  appellant to disprove negligence?</p>
<p>
  (4) Did the trial judge commit palpable and overriding errors in his assessment 
  of the evidence, especially in relation to the respondent's credibility?</p>
<p>
  (5) Did the trial judge err in permitting two doctors to give opinion evidence 
  about one aspect of the respondent's injuries?</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) Section 284(3) of the Municipal Act</p>
<p>
  [15] Hearst contends that Ouellette's action is precluded by s. 284(3) of the 
  Municipal Act: </p>
<p class="indent">
  s. 284(3) No action shall be brought against a corporation for the recovery 
  of damages caused by the presence or absence or insufficiency of any wall, fence, 
  guard rail, railing or barrier, or caused by or on account of any construction, 
  obstruction or erection or any situation, arrangement, or disposition of any 
  earth, rock, tree or other material or object adjacent to or in, along or upon 
  any highway or any part thereof not within the travelled portion of such highway.	
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [16] Hearst submits that the utility pole that it placed on the south side of 
  Highway 11 was an erection or object not within the travelled portion of such 
  highway. Accordingly, s. 284(3) applies and precluded Ouellette's action against 
  Hearst.</p>
<p>
  [17] I disagree. In my view, the plain meaning of s. 284(3) makes it clear that 
  it is inapplicable to this case. Ouellette's injuries were not caused by the 
  erection of an object not within the travelled portion of the highway. Rather, 
  they were caused by Hearst's alleged failure to properly secure and maintain 
  the pole, which broke, fell, and struck a van travelling on the highway.</p>
<p>
  [18] In Wahl v. Listowell (Town) (1988), 40 M.P.L.R. 276 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), the 
  plaintiff sued the Town of Listowell for damage to her house and porch caused 
  by a falling tree. The plaintiff alleged that the damage was sustained because 
  of the town's negligence when it uprooted a tree located immediately adjacent 
  to the travelled portion of the highway on a road allowance next to the plaintiff's 
  property.</p>
<p>
  [19] The town invoked s. 284(3) of the Municipal Act. Mullen D.C.J. rejected 
  the town's submission. He said, at p. 279: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In this case, in my opinion, the disposition of the tree is irrelevant, it is 
  the falling of the tree on the plaintiff's land that is complained of. I therefore 
  find that s. 284(3) of the Municipal Act is not a bar to the claim of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>
  [20] I agree with this analysis. The purpose and language of s. 284(3) is to 
  protect municipalities from actions where drivers leave the highway and strike 
  an object erected or constructed by the municipality adjacent to the highway. 
  In the present case, s. 284(3) would have precluded Ouellette's action if he 
  had driven off the highway and struck the utility pole where it had been placed. 
  That is not what happened; Ouellette was injured when the pole struck his van 
  while he was driving it on the highway. In short, s. 284(3) seeks to protect 
  municipalities from actions brought by drivers who go where they are not expected 
  to go (off the highway); it does not protect them from injuries to persons in 
  vehicles on the highway.</p>
<p>
  (2) Section 284(2) of the Municipal Act</p>
<p>
  [21] Ouellette's action against Hearst was framed in negligence. The limitation 
  period for a negligence action at the time of the accident was six years: see 
  s. 45(1) of the Limitations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15.</p>
<p>
  [22] Hearst contends that the label Ouellette attaches to its action is not 
  determinative of the limitation period issue. I agree. Although a plaintiff 
  may assert a common law action against a municipality, if the factual underpinning 
  of the claim amounts to an allegation of breach of any duty imposed on the municipality 
  by the Municipal Act, the action will be subject to any limitation period that 
  corresponds to the statutory duty: see Mero v.Waterloo (Regional Municipality) 
  (1992), 7 O.R. (3d) 102 at 110-11 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [23] Hearst then contends that its conduct potentially comes within its duty, 
  pursuant to s. 284(1) of the Municipal Act, to keep the highway in a reasonable 
  state of repair. If this assertion is accepted, it would necessarily follow 
  that the corresponding limitation period in s. 284(2) - three months - would 
  apply because, as Carthy J.A. stated in Mero at p. 106, ss. 284(1) and (2) "necessarily 
  move together." Accordingly, Hearst submits, Ouellette's action against 
  Hearst should have been dismissed because it was brought twenty months after 
  the cause of action arose.</p>
<p>
  [24] The relevant provisions of the Municipal Act are: </p>
<p class="indent"> s. 284 (1) The council of the corporation that has jurisdiction 
  over a highway or bridge shall keep it in a state of repair that is reasonable 
  in light of all the circumstances, including the character and location of the 
  highway or bridge.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) No action shall be brought against a corporation for the 
  recovery of damages occasioned by such default, whether the want of a reasonable 
  state of repair was the result of nonfeasance or misfeasance, after the expiration 
  of three months from the time when the damages were sustained.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [25] The jurisprudence on the scope of the duty of a municipal corporation to 
  keep its highways in repair is extensive. Hearst cites a number of cases in 
  support of its claim that Ouellette's action falls within the scope of an action 
  for non-repair: Mero, supra; Ferguson v. Southwold (Township) (1895), 27 O.R. 
  66 (C.A.); Marchand v. Duff, [1942] 1 D.L.R. 520 (Ont. H.C.J.), aff'd [1942] 
  O.W.N. 123 (C.A.); Couch v. Louise (Municipality) (1907), 16 Man. R. 656 (C.A.); 
  Gougeon v. Foley (Township) (1977), 16 O.R. (2d) 625 (H.C.J.); Van Nice v. Calgary 
  (City) (1979), 24 A.R. 385 (S.C.(T.D.)); and Hartley v. Ottawa (City) (1932), 
  41 O.W.N. 301 (H.C.J.).</p>
<p>
  [26] The scope of the duty to repair has been defined in broad terms. In Mero, 
  Carthy J.A. explained at p. 110 that "[i]t has been said to be so broad 
  as to encompass 'something wrong &#133; in [the municipal corporation's] highway' 
  (Brown v. Toronto (City) (1910), 21 O.L.R. 230 at 233 (Div. Ct), at p. 234)." 
  In the cases cited by Hearst, a wide array of circumstances was held to constitute 
  "something wrong in the highway." The circumstances include a rail 
  projecting above the pavement (Hartley), a rod projecting into a lane of traffic 
  (Van Nice), chains and barbed wire stretched out over the surface of a highway 
  (Couch, Gougeon), and trees extending into the travelled portion of a highway 
  (Ferguson, Marchand). The principle that emerges from these cases is that the 
  duty of a municipality to keep its highways in repair includes an obligation 
  to regularly inspect those highways for obstacles. If there is an obstacle on 
  or extending over the travelled portion of a highway, the municipal corporation 
  responsible for that highway has a duty to remove the obstacle. If the municipality 
  breaches that duty, an individual injured by the obstacle may bring an action 
  for non-repair against the municipality.</p>
<p>
  [27] The specific factual circumstances of this case do not fit within the ambit 
  of non-repair of a highway. In every case cited by Hearst on this issue, the 
  municipality's breach of its duty to keep one of its highways in repair stemmed 
  from its failure to properly inspect the travelled portion of that highway. 
  In this case, Hearst had no opportunity to inspect the highway and remove the 
  snapped-off portion of the pole: Ouellette was injured at the very moment the 
  pole snapped apart. Up until the moment the pole snapped, it did not constitute 
  "something wrong in the highway." Even if Hearst performed daily inspections 
  of the travelled portion of the highway, it could not have prevented the accident 
  which occurred in this case. I conclude, therefore, that the accident did not 
  occur as a result of any failure on the part of Hearst to properly inspect the 
  travelled portion of its highway for obstacles. </p>
<p>
  [28] Hearst's failure to prevent Ouellette's accident could only qualify as 
  a breach of its duty to keep its highways in repair if that duty included an 
  obligation to inspect and maintain objects outside the travelled portion of 
  the highway that could potentially fall onto the travelled portion of a highway. 
  None of the cases cited by Hearst stands for the proposition that a municipality's 
  duty to keep its highways in a reasonable state of repair extends quite that 
  far. </p>
<p>
  [29] There is a second, and different, observation about the case law cited 
  by Hearst that should be made. Most of the cited cases are fairly old. They 
  were decided at a time when there was little scope in the common law for actions 
  against municipalities for keeping their highways in a reasonable state of repair. 
  Accordingly, courts tended to interpret the duty in s. 284(1) in a broad fashion. 
  As explained by Carthy J.A. in Mero at p. 106: </p>
<p class="indent">
  What we see historically is that the law in Ontario has developed on the assumption 
  that there is no common law liability upon a municipality respecting maintenance 
  of highways except for nuisance and, as the natural evolution of what might 
  have been termed a very restrictive statutory cause of action in s. 284(1) has 
  progressed, the courts have been increasingly liberal in the interpretation 
  of what constitutes non-repair of a highway.</p>
<p>
  [30] There is no longer a need to stretch the wording of s. 284(1) to ground 
  what are, in reality, proposed negligence actions against municipalities. That 
  is because in Just v. British Columbia, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1228, the Supreme Court 
  of Canada held that the traditional tort law duty of care could apply to a government 
  agency respecting the maintenance of highways where there was no express statutory 
  duty imposed. In the wake of Just, s. 284(1) need not be interpreted to cover 
  a situation that amounts to an extension of the statutory duty to repair; rather, 
  an action against a municipality in this context can proceed as a negligence 
  action, as pleaded in this case. It follows that the limitation period for negligence 
  actions - six years at the time of the accident (now two years) - is also applicable.</p>
<p>
  [31] For these reasons, I conclude that the trial judge did not err by holding 
  that the limitation period in s. 284(2) of the Municipal Act was inapplicable 
  in this case.</p>
<p> (3) Negligence<a href="#1">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> </p>
<p>
  [32] Hearst contends that the trial judge reversed the onus of proof on the 
  negligence issue. It cites this passage in the trial judge's reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Ouellette does not have to show why the pole broke but only that it could not 
  have done so without negligence on Hearst's part. Hearst has not met the evidentiary 
  burden of rebutting that presumption. The evidence satisfies Ouellette's legal 
  burden of establishing negligence on a balance of probabilities: this installation 
  was insecure and so Hearst was negligent.</p>
<p>
  [33] I disagree. Negligence can be inferred in appropriate cases. In his leading 
  text, Canadian Tort Law, 7th ed. (Butterworths: Markham, 2001), Justice Allen 
  Linden, the dean of Canadian tort law scholars, states at p. 236: "If, 
  in the ordinary course of events, an accident would not occur in the absence 
  of negligence, a court might infer negligence." Linden then proceeds to 
  a discussion of seventeen cases under the heading "Falling Objects" 
  in which courts have inferred negligence.</p>
<p>
  [34] In the present case, the trial judge carefully reviewed a number of factors 
  surrounding the erection and maintenance of the utility pole and the decision 
  to hang a banner across the highway from the two poles. He concluded that any 
  of these factors, either alone or concurrently, rendered the pole insecure and 
  caused the accident. In my view, this reasoning amounted to proper inference 
  drawing; it was not reversing the onus of proof.</p>
<p>
  [35] I observe, parenthetically, that the trial judge did not mention or follow 
  the analysis in Just. However, implicit in his conclusion that "this installation 
  was insecure" is a municipality's duty to secure and/or maintain a utility 
  pole that it erected in close proximity to a major highway running through the 
  municipality. Moreover, although the trial judge did not mention the policy 
  decision/operational decision dichotomy set out in Just, it is clear in this 
  case that Hearst's decision to erect the utility pole was an operational decision 
  which could ground an action in negligence.</p>
<p>
  (4) The respondent's credibility</p>
<p>
  [36] Hearst contends that the trial judge ignored or misapprehended Ouellette's 
  evidence on three issues: (1) his position on whether he intended to return 
  to work; (2) the cause and seriousness of the injury to his left knee; and (3) 
  the reason he quit work in March 2001.</p>
<p>
  [37] I disagree. The trial judge's review of Ouellette's evidence about his 
  physical injuries and employment situation was careful and relatively comprehensive. 
  Indeed, in important respects the trial judge assessed damages on a basis quite 
  favourable to Hearst. For example, on the employment issue, he said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is likely that he will attempt a return to work. None of the medical experts 
  has said that he is incapable of working at present. Ouellette himself wants 
  to return to work; he indicated to his doctor that he would be returning to 
  work in January, 2002, which, coincidentally, is immediately at the conclusion 
  of this trial.</p>
<p>
  [38] In Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at 255, a case involving, 
  incidentally, a claim of negligence against a municipality, Iacobucci and Major 
  JJ. observed that "although the same high standard of deference applies 
  to the entire range of factual determinations made by the trial judge, where 
  a factual finding is grounded in an assessment of credibility of a witness, 
  the overwhelming advantage of the trial judge in this area must be acknowledged." 
  I can see nothing in the trial judge's assessment of the evidence, including 
  Ouellette's testimony, that comes even close to being a palpable and overriding 
  error, which is the hurdle Hearst must clear.</p>
<p>
  (5) Medical opinion evidence</p>
<p>
  [39] Rule 53.03 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, requires 
  that a party intending to call an expert must serve on every other party a report 
  setting out his or her qualifications and testimony. Dr. Bertrand Proulx, Ouellette's 
  treating physician, and Dr. D.J. Ogilvie-Harris testified for Ouellette. Dr. 
  Ogilvie-Harris delivered an expert report; Dr. Proulx did not. Hearst contends 
  that the trial judge erred by permitting Ouellette's counsel to solicit expert 
  evidence from the two doctors on the issue of whether there was a causal nexus 
  between the injury to Ouellette's left knee and the subsequent injury to his 
  right knee.</p>
<p>
  [40] I disagree. The trial judge did not permit Dr. Proulx to testify as an 
  expert and give opinion evidence. The trial judge ruled that Dr. Ogilvie-Harris' 
  opinion about the causal link between the injuries to both knees came within 
  the four corners of his report which had been served pursuant to rule 53.03. 
  Finally, and importantly, the trial judge did not mention an injury to the right 
  knee in either his causation analysis or his assessment of damages. In short, 
  this issue is a red herring.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [41] I would dismiss the appeal. The respondent is entitled to his costs of 
  the appeal on the partial indemnity scale, which I would fix at $30,000, inclusive 
  of disbursements and GST.</p>
