<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The motions judge did not err in granting summary judgment. OW submits 
  that a lease between Target and Ex-L was assigned to it. EX-L, as landlord, 
  had to agree to any assignment in writing for it to be valid. No assignment 
  in writing was ever executed and there was no valid assignment. </p>
<p>[2] The appellant asserts that an oral agreement for a five year lease was 
  reached and that all essential terms were agreed upon. In support of this submission 
  he relies on the affidavit of his client which states that he made suggested 
  changes to a draft lease and that, "Michael informed me they would edit 
  my changes and get a revised copy back to me." In the circumstances this 
  statement cannot be elevated to an agreement to lease for five years. More importantly, 
  the claim alleges that the respondent deceived the appellant and had no intention 
  of entering into an agreement. As noted by the motions judge OW does not plead 
  that EX-L agreed to any other 5-year lease. </p>
<p>[3] Finally we see no error in the motion judge's conclusion that the order 
  of Sachs J. effectively disposed of the issue of whether the tenancy was terminated 
  and indeed abandoned. </p>
<p>[4] The appeal is therefore dismissed. Costs of the appeal to the respondent 
  fixed at $5000 all-inclusive.</p>
