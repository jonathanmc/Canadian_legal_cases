<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: June 15, 2004</p>
<p>[1] The appellants seek to set aside the summary judgment granted by Dunn J. 
  on September 3, 2003, dismissing their action as statute barred by operation 
  of the one-year limitation period in s. 89(1) of the Regulated Health Professions 
  Act, 1991, S.O., c. 18. The action is based on the admitted negligence of Ms. 
  Mary Worry, a pharmacist employed by the corporate defendant.</p>
<p>[2] The respondents failed to plead the material facts necessary to support 
  the contention that the individual defendant was a member of the Ontario College 
  of Pharmacists and therefore entitled to the protection of the limitation period 
  in s. 89 of the Regulated Health Protection Act. This defect was not remedied 
  by the affidavit filed in support of the summary judgment motion. There being 
  no evidence before the motions judge that the individual defendant was a member 
  of the College, there was no basis upon which the motions judge could conclude 
  that the limitation period applied to the individual defendant.</p>
<p>[3] The motions judge gave no reasons for concluding that the corporate defendant 
  was entitled to the protection of the limitation period in s. 89. It is clear 
  that there is a live issue as to what limitation period applies to the corporate 
  defendant and whether it can claim the protection of s. 89. As a consequence, 
  the motions judge could not have properly concluded that there was no genuine 
  issue for trial in respect of the corporate defendant.</p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the judgment below is set aside 
  with costs to the appellant fixed in the sum of $350.00 inclusive.</p>
