<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Thomas R. Lofchik of the Superior Court 
  of Justice, dated March 6, 2003.</p>
<p>SHARPE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This appeal involves the procedural rights that arise under the Planning 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990 c. P-13 (the "Act") when a party applies for an 
  official plan amendment, zoning change, or approval of a draft plan of subdivision 
  but refuses to provide information required by the municipal council to consider 
  the application. The appellant municipality takes the position that it is entitled 
  to refuse to deal with the application until the required information is supplied. 
  In contrast, the respondent says that the council's only remedy is to 
  refuse the application, and that if the council fails to deal with the application 
  within the period prescribed by the Act, the applicant has an immediate right 
  of appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board (the "O.M.B."). </p>
<p>
  [2] The Act contains detailed provisions setting out the procedure to be followed 
  for applications for official plan amendments (s. 22), for changes to zoning 
  by-laws (s. 34), and for approval of plans of subdivision (s. 51). As the case 
  at bar was considered by the application judge and argued before us essentially 
  on the basis of s. 22, I will focus on that section in these reasons. My reasons, 
  however, are equally applicable to s.34 and s.51 since all three sections are 
  quite similar in wording and contain parallel provisions. </p>
<p>
  [3] The relevant part of s. 22 provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> 22. (1) Request to council. - If a person or public body requests 
  a council to amend its official plan, the council shall, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) forward a copy of the request and the information and material 
  required under subsection (4) to the appropriate approval authority, whether 
  or not the requested amendment is exempt from approval; and </p>
<p class="indent">(b) within 65 days after the request is received, hold a public 
  meeting under subsection 17(15) or comply with the alternative measures set 
  out in the official plan. </p>
<p class="indent">&#8230;</p>
<p class="indent">(3) No public meeting. - Despite subsections (1) and (2), the 
  requirement to hold a public meeting under subsection 17(15) is waived if the 
  council or the planning board refuses to adopt an amendment to its official 
  plan requested by a person or public body. </p>
<p class="indent">(4) Prescribed information. - A person or public body that requests 
  an amendment to the official plan of a municipality or planning board shall 
  provide the prescribed information and material to the council or planning board. 
</p>
<p class="indent">(5) Other information. - A council or a planning board may require 
  that a person or public body that requests an amendment to its official plan 
  provide such other information or material that the council or planning board 
  considers it may need. </p>
<p class="indent">(6) Refusal and timing. - Until a council or planning board 
  has received the prescribed information and material required under subsection 
  (4) and any fee under section 69, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) the council or planning board may refuse to accept or further 
  consider the request for an amendment to its official plan; and </p>
<p class="indent">(b) the time periods referred to in clauses (7) (a) to (d) do 
  not begin. </p>
<p class="indent">(7) Appeal to the Municipal Board. - A person or public body 
  that requests an amendment to the official plan of a municipality or planning 
  board may appeal to the Municipal Board in respect of all or any part of the 
  requested amendment by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the municipality 
  or the secretary-treasurer of the planning board if, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) the council or the planning board fails to give notice of 
  a public meeting under subsection 17(15), if required, within 45 days after 
  the request is received; </p>
<p> (b) a<span class="indent"> planning board recommends a requested amendment 
  for adoption to a council or two or more councils and the council or the majority 
  of the councils that are within the planning area of a planning board fails 
  to give notice of a public meeting under subsection 17(15), if required, within 
  45 days after the request is received; </span></p>
<p class="indent"> (c) the council or the planning board fails to adopt the requested 
  amendment within 90 days after the day the request is received; </p>
<p class="indent"> (d) a planning board recommends a requested amendment for adoption 
  and the council or the majority of the councils fails to adopt the requested 
  amendment within 90 days after the day the request is received; </p>
<p class="indent"> (e) a council, a majority of the councils or a planning board 
  refuses to adopt the requested amendment; or </p>
<p class="indent"> (f) a planning board refuses to approve a requested amendment 
  under subsection 18(1). </p>
<p class="indent">&#8230;</p>
<p class="indent">(9) Record and forwarding material. - The clerk of a municipality 
  or the secretary-treasurer of a planning board who receives a notice of appeal 
  under subsection (7) shall ensure that, </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) a record is compiled which includes the prescribed information 
  and material; </p>
<p class="indent"> (b) the notice of appeal, the record and the fee are forwarded 
  to the Municipal Board within 15 days after the notice is received; </p>
<p class="indent"> (c) the notice of appeal and the record are forwarded to the 
  appropriate approval authority within 15 days after the notice is received, 
  whether or not the plan is exempt from approval, unless the approval authority 
  has notified the municipality or the planning board that it does not wish to 
  receive copies of the notices of appeal and the records; and </p>
<p class="indent"> (d) such other information or material as the Municipal 
  Board may require in respect of the appeal is forwarded to the Board. 
</p>
<p>
  [4] It is common ground that the respondents provided the appellant with all 
  the prescribed information and material in compliance with s. 22(4), and that 
  the appellant required further information pursuant to s. 22(5). It is also 
  common ground that the appellant's demand for further information was 
  reasonable and that the information required was relevant to the planning decision 
  the council was being asked to make. The respondents refused to provide the 
  required information. They took the position that they were entitled to proceed 
  directly before the O.M.B. by way of appeal as, under s. 22(6), the 90 day period 
  for decision by the council (as prescribed by s. 22(7)) started to run from 
  the date the council had received the application fee and the information prescribed 
  by s. 22(4). </p>
<p>
  [5] The respondents filed a notice of appeal with the clerk of the municipality 
  pursuant to s. 22(7), but the clerk refused to forward a record to the O.M.B., 
  on the ground that the respondents had not provided the council with the information 
  required under s. 22(5) and, until such information was provided, the 90-day 
  period for a decision by the council did not start to run. </p>
<p>
  [6] The respondents then commenced this application to compel the clerk to forward 
  the record to the O.M.B. so that they could proceed with their appeal. The application 
  judge ruled that s. 22 draws a clear distinction between prescribed information 
  under s. 22(4) and required information under s. 22(5). As s. 22(6) made no 
  reference to s. 22(5) in relation to the commencement of the 90-day period for 
  a decision by council, he held at para. 13 that the respondents were entitled 
  to appeal to the O.M.B. despite their failure to provide the information required 
  under s. 22(5): </p>
<p class="indent">
  By limiting the refusal of the municipality to deal with the application to 
  failure to comply with subsection (4) and making no mention of subsection (5), 
  the Legislature has specifically denied the municipality the right to refuse 
  to deal with the application if the material requested pursuant to subsection 
  (5) is not provided (expressio unius est exlcusio alterius). If the Legislature 
  had intended that a council may refuse to deal with an application if the information 
  under subsection (5) is not provided by an applicant, it could have very easily 
  added after the words "and any fee under s. 69", the words, "and 
  the information and material required under subsection (5)". </p>
<p>[7] The appellant submits that the application judge erred in his interpretation 
  of the Act, and that if the respondents are allowed to proceed by way of appeal 
  to the O.M.B. without providing the required information, important purposes 
  of the Act will be frustrated. In particular, the appellant argues that the 
  interpretation is inconsistent with the purposes enunciated in s. 1(d), "to 
  provide for planning processes that are fair by making them open, accessible, 
  timely and efficient" and s. 1(f),"to recognize the decision-making 
  authority and accountability of Municipal Councils in planning". The appellant 
  contends that the application judge erred in affording s. 22 an unduly literal 
  interpretation that allows applicants to by-pass municipal councils and evade 
  the open, accessible and fully informed decision-making process at the local 
  level contemplated by the Act. The appellant places particular emphasis upon 
  the provision requiring a public meeting (s. 22(1)), and on the importance of 
  affording interested citizens an opportunity to participate in important community 
  decisions. The appellant submits that this court should give the Act an interpretation 
  that will respect and reinforce these important statutory purposes, and asks 
  us to read s. 22(6) as if it referred not only to the information prescribed 
  by s. 22(4), but also to the information required under s. 22(5), thereby preserving 
  the important role of municipal councils in the planning process. Reliance is 
  placed upon Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 at para. 27, 
  where Iacobucci J. stated, </p>
<p class="indent"> It is a well established principle of statutory interpretation 
  that the legislature does not intend to produce absurd consequences.&#8230;An 
  interpretation can be considered absurd if it leads to ridiculous or frivolous 
  consequences, if it is extremely unreasonable or inequitable, if it is illogical 
  or incoherent, or if it is incompatible with other provisions or with the object 
  of the legislative enactment.</p>
<p>[8] While I agree that the application judge's interpretation significantly 
  diminishes the role of the council in local planning decisions, I cannot agree 
  that the application judge erred in his interpretation of the Act. In my view, 
  the Act plainly draws a clear and sharp distinction between prescribed information 
  under s. 22(4) and required information under s. 22(5) and lays down, in specific 
  terms, the remedies available in the event of non-compliance. An applicant must 
  provide the information prescribed under s. 22(4), and if the applicant fails 
  to comply, the council can refuse to deal with the application. Once the applicant 
  has provided the prescribed information, the council can require further information 
  under s. 22(5). Should the applicant fail to comply with that demand, the council 
  is entitled to refuse the application but, since ss. 22(6) and (7) establish 
  a 90-day period for decision from the date the fee is paid and the prescribed 
  information is provided, the council is not entitled to refuse to deal with 
  the application until it receives the required information. </p>
<p>
  [9] I am aware that this interpretation effectively short-circuits the process 
  of public meetings at the local level by permitting applicants to appeal directly 
  to the O.M.B. without first providing the council with required information. 
  However, I cannot accept that we should regard the omission of any reference 
  in s. 22(6) to the information required under s. 22(5) as a slip of the legislative 
  pen, capable of leading to an absurd result that can or should be judicially 
  repaired. The fact that the same pattern is followed in the parallel provisions 
  in s. 34 in relation to zoning changes and in s. 51 with respect to approval 
  of plans of subdivisions indicates that the legislature was cognizant of the 
  consequences of adopting such wording at the time of enactment. While the result 
  may be regrettable from the perspective of a municipal council eager to ensure 
  full public participation in planning decisions at the local level, I agree 
  with the application judge that that appears to be what the legislature intended. 
  Simply put, the legislature has adopted a balance of rights that curtails the 
  role of municipal councils to some extent, and allows applicants to proceed 
  more expeditiously by way of appeal to the O.M.B. In the end, this seems to 
  me to be a legislative choice that falls well short of the kind of absurd, illogical 
  or incoherent result that is to be avoided through interpretation, as stipulated 
  in Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd., supra. </p>
<p>
  [10] I would add, however, that an applicant's refusal to comply with 
  a council's demand for the information required to make a proper planning 
  decision need not go unnoticed before the O.M.B. The legislature clearly intended 
  that the council could request information in addition to the prescribed information 
  and the respondents have refused to provide the additional information requested 
  by the council. The respondents are entitled to appeal to the O.M.B. but it 
  will be for the O.M.B. to decide what effect, if any, it ought to give to the 
  respondents' refusal to comply with the council's request. In view 
  of the broad statutory powers conferred upon the O.M.B., it would certainly 
  be within the O.M.B.'s discretion to return the application to the council 
  with its direction. </p>
<p>
  [11] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondents 
  fixed at $10,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
