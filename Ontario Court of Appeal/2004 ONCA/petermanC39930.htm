<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Helen K. MacLeod of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 3, 2003.</p>
<p>
  ROSENBERG J.A.: </p>
<p> [1] This is an appeal by Legal Aid Ontario and the Crown pursuant to s. 676.1 
  of the Criminal Code<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> from an order made 
  by MacLeod J. that Legal Aid or the Crown pay to the respondent's counsel certain 
  costs associated with the respondent's defence to charges of arson. At the conclusion 
  of the hearing of the appeal, the court allowed the appeal, quashed the order 
  and indicated that additional reasons would be provided. As we said at the time, 
  the type of order made by the application judge in this case, a so-called Fisher 
  order (R. v. Fisher, [1997] S.J. No. 530 (Q.B.)), is justified only in unusual 
  circumstances, and there was no evidence to support the making of the order 
  in this case.</p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  The chronology</p>
<p>
  [2] While a detailed review of the facts is not necessary, it is important to 
  set out certain benchmarks in the proceedings. On April 30, 2001, the respondent 
  Bryan Peterman was charged with two counts of arson for a fraudulent purpose 
  contrary to s. 435(1) of the Criminal Code, one count of arson contrary to s. 
  434 of the Criminal Code, and one count of arson contrary to s. 434.1 of the 
  Criminal Code. The charges relate to a fire that had occurred about one month 
  earlier in the Town of Smiths Falls. The trial is to take place in the nearby 
  Town of Perth. The respondent was financially eligible for legal aid and the 
  appellant Legal Aid Ontario issued him a legal aid certificate. The certificate 
  allowed the respondent to select a lawyer of his choice to represent him, provided 
  the lawyer would accept the certificate. The certificate carries with it certain 
  conditions. The lawyer must bill Legal Aid at the legal aid tariff and accept 
  certain limitations. </p>
<p>
  [3] The most important limitations involved in this case concern payment of 
  fees and expenses of out-of-town counsel, preparation time and retention of 
  junior counsel. With respect to the former, Legal Aid has certain policies concerning 
  the use of out-of-town counsel. If there is competent counsel available in the 
  jurisdiction where the offence took place, Legal Aid will not ordinarily pay 
  an out-of-town lawyer for travel time and disbursements such as mileage, meals 
  and accommodation. In any event, counsel requires prior authorization from the 
  Legal Aid director for the area where the trial is to take place to be paid 
  for travel time and such expenses. Similarly, counsel requires prior authorization 
  from the area director to retain junior counsel to assist in the defence.</p>
<p>
  [4] In May 2001, the respondent approached Charles Wrock to represent him on 
  the arson charges. The respondent had confidence in Mr. Wrock who had acted 
  for him on several civil and criminal matters, including criminal matters in 
  1996 and 1997. On May 22, 2001, the respondent received his legal aid certificate 
  and Mr. Wrock agreed to act for him on the certificate. Mr. Wrock's office is 
  not in the Perth area. He works in Newmarket, a minimum four-hour drive from 
  Perth. </p>
<p>
  [5] Soon after he accepted the legal aid certificate, Mr. Wrock sought authorization 
  from Michael Cliffen, the Legal Aid area director for Lanark County, for "travel 
  authorization". In June 2001, Mr. Cliffen turned down the request. Counsel 
  pursued the request throughout 2001, but without success. In November 2001, 
  the final internal appeal from Mr. Cliffen's decision was dismissed. The following 
  is an excerpt from the reasons of the appeals officer: </p>
<p class="indent"> Counsel points out that he has a continuing solicitor and client 
  relationship with this legal aid applicant and he has knowledge of the background 
  of the offence as it relates to the purchase of property and insurance. The 
  applicant is on a contributory certificate. These factors weigh in favour of 
  granting travel authorization. However, Legal Aid Policy's primary focus respecting 
  this issue is whether there is available counsel in the area where the trial 
  is taking place who are competent and available to conduct the proceedings. 
  I have concluded that the Area Committee correctly determined that the authorization 
  for travel should be denied in this case.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no indication that local counsel is unavailable or 
  unable to conduct these proceedings. The fact that counsel from Newmarket has 
  conducted part of the Judicial Pre-trial and has familiarity with the case does 
  not, in my view, weigh heavily in favour of authorizing travel as counsel was 
  advised prior to his attendance at the pre-trial that travel authorization was 
  not granted. It does not seem to me that a fee-paying client of modest means 
  would choose counsel from outside the jurisdiction in these circumstances to 
  conduct a trial with a pre-trial, preliminary and trial which are likely to 
  last at least several days and accommodation, in addition to travel, would be 
  necessary. Nor does it appear to me that authorization for travel in this case 
  would be in accordance with the policies of Legal Aid. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [6] On December 17, 2001, counsel wrote to Mr. Cliffen one more time asking 
  for a further reconsideration of the decision in light of the fact that the 
  respondent had moved back to the Newmarket area. The following day, Mr. Cliffen 
  again refused the request. That was the last contact with Legal Aid. At no time, 
  did Mr. Wrock seek authorization for junior counsel.</p>
<p>
  [7] On June 4, 2002, the respondent and Mr. Wrock attended for the preliminary 
  inquiry in Perth. The preliminary inquiry was scheduled for seven days but concluded 
  after only one day, apparently because an alleged accomplice agreed to testify 
  as a Crown witness. At the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry, the respondent 
  was ordered to stand trial. On September 5, 2002, he was charged in an indictment 
  that included the original two charges and two further charges of arson under 
  ss. 434 and 434.1 of the Criminal Code. A pre-trial was conducted on October 
  11, 2002. It was estimated that the jury trial would last seven days. On November 
  15, 2002, a trial date was set in the Superior Court of Justice for May 5, 2003. 
  Approximately one year had now elapsed since counsel last had contact with Legal 
  Aid and neither he nor the respondent had taken steps to retain local counsel 
  to take over the defence of the charges.</p>
<p>
  [8] In February 2003, the respondent brought a "Fisher" application. 
  The application, which included a challenge to the constitutionality of the 
  Legal Aid Services Act, 1998, S.O. 1998, c. 26 and Regulations, was served on 
  the local Crown Attorney and the Attorneys General of Ontario and Canada. By 
  inadvertence it was not served on Legal Aid Ontario. The application was returnable 
  March 14, 2003. Legal Aid found out about the application from the Crown and 
  requested an adjournment to give it an opportunity to provide submissions and 
  evidence. The application was adjourned to April 3, 2003.</p>
<p>
  The nature of the application</p>
<p> [9] In his application, the respondent sought an order for payment at rates 
  in excess of the normal legal aid tariff for Mr. Wrock and junior counsel retroactive 
  to April 30, 2001. He also sought payment of counsel's reasonable disbursements, 
  payment of counsel for the full amount of preparation time with no maximum limit 
  on the number of hours of preparation,<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> and 
  payment for counsel's meals and accommodation.</p>
<p>
  The factual basis for the application</p>
<p>
  [10] The application was supported by two affidavits, one sworn by the respondent 
  and the other sworn by Mr. Wrock's associate. In his affidavit, the respondent 
  set out the history of his relationship with Mr. Wrock and stated that he had 
  confidence in him because of that history. He further stated that unless the 
  government were to pay reasonable remuneration, he would not be able to afford 
  to pay Mr. Wrock for representing him in this case.</p>
<p>
  [11] In the second affidavit, which was provided by junior counsel, the application 
  of the legal aid scheme to the respondent's case and the history of contacts 
  with Legal Aid were summarized. The affidavit concluded with this statement: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Having reviewed the disclosure and discussed the case with Charles Wrock, I 
  am satisfied that no competent lawyer could effectively represent Mr. Peterman 
  in this case based upon the fees allotted by the Legal Aid Ontario system. I 
  agree with Charles Wrock that the preparation of this case will exceed the allowable 
  time under the criminal tariff. The only way that a lawyer would be able to 
  spend less time preparing this case would be to forego some of the Motions and 
  Pre-trials, which would arguably advance the Applicant's defence or to forego 
  the careful preparation which would be required to effectively examine and cross-examine 
  the witnesses in this case. I further verily believe that as a result of the 
  complexity of this case, Mr. Wrock requires my assistance with respect to preparation 
  of Examinations and Cross-examinations and technical legal research.</p>
<p>
  [12] There was no evidence that there was no competent lawyer in the Perth area 
  able to take the respondent's case. In the course of oral submissions before 
  the application judge, Mr. Wrock stated the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Our investigations indicate that there are only seven lawyers in Lanark County 
  who practice criminal law, one in Perth, one in Carleton Place and five in Smiths 
  Falls. Only one practices criminal law exclusively.</p>
<p>
  [13] Counsel did not suggest that he or the respondent had approached any of 
  these lawyers or that they were not competent to defend the respondent. </p>
<p> [14] Although the application had originally been adjourned at Legal Aid's 
  request, counsel for Legal Aid did not attend the hearing. Counsel for Legal 
  Aid did, however, file written argument and Mr. Cliffen was available in the 
  courtroom to testify. Crown counsel sought leave of the trial judge to call 
  Mr. Cliffen to testify about the availability of local counsel to represent 
  the respondent. The trial judge refused because the Crown and Legal Aid had 
  not complied with Rule 27.05(3) of the Criminal Proceedings Rules<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a>, 
  which requires the respondent to a Charter application to file affidavit evidence 
  where it seeks to rely on material not filed by the applicant. On this appeal, 
  the Crown and Legal Aid Ontario seek to admit as fresh evidence an affidavit 
  setting out the evidence Mr. Cliffen would have given. </p>
<p>
  [15] In his submissions before the application judge, Mr. Wrock stated that 
  for the trial the Crown had thirty witnesses and that there would be four defence 
  witnesses.</p>
<p>
  The Reasons of the Application Judge</p>
<p>
  [16] The application judge found that the case against the respondent was "by 
  its very nature, a complex case and not one that is of average sort of complexity". 
  She appeared to base this finding on the nature of the arson case and that a 
  former accomplice had agreed to be a Crown witness. She decided that "[a]ll 
  of these things are exceedingly complicating in a case where Mr. Peterman's 
  liberty is significantly at stake." She then framed the issue in these 
  terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The issue and the real concern that I have at this point, being April the 3rd, 
  looking at a now fixed trial date of May the 5th, is about the fairness of the 
  trial should these matters not be resolved and should the accused be forced 
  to have to defend himself.</p>
<p>
  [17] The application judge refused to grant most of the relief sought by the 
  respondent. She dismissed the challenge to the constitutionality of the Legal 
  Aid Services Act, 1998 and refused to make any order for an increase in the 
  hourly rate above the legal aid rates. She also stated that there should not 
  be a stay of proceedings. </p>
<p>
  [18] The application judge nevertheless went on to find that, "This is 
  a complicated case, the trial being May the 5th, I'm satisfied that no other 
  person other than Mr. Wrock could do a fair representation of the accused at 
  this stage." She decided that the denial of travel time, reasonable preparation 
  time and travel expenses was unreasonable and that the request for junior counsel 
  was reasonable. She stated that she had "some serious concerns" that 
  if counsel's travel expenses and reasonable accommodation and meal expenses 
  were not paid "the accused [would] not receive a fair trial".</p>
<p>
  [19] Accordingly, the application judge ordered that Legal Aid Ontario pay for 
  the junior counsel and for his and Mr. Wrock's travel time, travel and meal 
  expenses and all of their preparation time, "with the only limitation being 
  the reasonableness of the time expended". Failing payment by Legal Aid 
  Ontario, these expenses were to be paid by the Ministry of the Attorney General.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p> [20] Defence counsel who undertake to defend indigent accused through the 
  legal aid system perform an invaluable service to the community and to the administration 
  of justice in this province. The state has a constitutional obligation to ensure 
  that indigent accused receive a fair trial, and in many cases that means ensuring 
  that the accused is represented by counsel. Under the Ontario legal aid certificate 
  system, it is because defence lawyers are willing to accept legal aid certificates 
  and provide competent and effective counsel to accused facing criminal charges 
  that the state is able to fulfill its constitutional obligation. The importance 
  of the work that defence counsel perform for legal aid clients cannot be underestimated. 
  Moreover, defence counsel agree to perform these services at rates, and in accordance 
  with conditions, that mean they will not always be fully reimbursed for all 
  the work they do to ensure that clients caught up in the criminal justice system 
  receive fair treatment and an effective defence. See the comments of Nicholas 
  J. in R. v. G.L., [2002] O.J. No. 3898 (C.J.).</p>
<p>
  [21] However, under our system the obligation for setting legal aid rates and 
  policies relating to retention of out-of-town counsel and of junior or co-counsel 
  lies with Legal Aid Ontario, not the court. See New Brunswick (Minister of Health 
  and Community Services v. G. (J.), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 46 at paras. 102 - 8 and 
  R. v. Cai (2002), 170 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Alta. C.A.), application for leave to appeal 
  to the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed [2003] S.C.C.A. No. 253, at paras. 
  8 - 18. A criminal trial court has no jurisdiction to review those policies 
  and, having determined that they are unreasonable, impose other arrangements 
  on Legal Aid Ontario. A criminal trial court's jurisdiction rests solely on 
  the obligation to ensure that an accused person receives a fair trial. In some 
  cases, the court will be satisfied that if an accused is not represented by 
  counsel, his or her right to a fair trial as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11(d) of 
  the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms will be infringed. If such an accused 
  lacks the means to employ counsel privately, but has nevertheless been refused 
  legal aid, the court can make an order staying the proceedings until the necessary 
  funding for counsel is provided by the state. The trial will then not proceed 
  until either the government or Legal Aid Ontario provides funding for counsel. 
  This is a so-called Rowbotham order based on this court's decision in R. v. 
  Rowbotham (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1. The court explained the legal basis for 
  this order at p. 66: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In our opinion, those who framed the Charter did not expressly constitutionalize 
  the right of an indigent accused to be provided with counsel, because they considered 
  that, generally speaking, the provincial legal aid systems were adequate to 
  provide counsel for persons charged with serious crimes who lacked the means 
  to employ counsel. However, in cases not falling within provincial legal aid 
  plans, ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter, which guarantee an accused a fair trial 
  in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, require funded counsel 
  to be provided if the accused wishes counsel, but cannot pay a lawyer, and representation 
  of the accused by counsel is essential to a fair trial.</p>
<p>
  [22] In some cases, legal aid has been refused because in accordance with legal 
  aid guidelines, the person does not qualify financially for legal aid. Where 
  the accused seeks a Rowbotham order, the court, while giving appropriate deference 
  to the decision of Legal Aid, must reach its own decision about whether the 
  accused can afford counsel. As was said in Rowbotham at p. 69, "there may 
  be rare circumstances in which legal aid is denied but the trial judge, after 
  an examination of the means of the accused, is satisfied that the accused, because 
  of the length and complexity of the proceedings or for other reasons, cannot 
  afford to retain counsel to the extent necessary to ensure a fair trial". 
  However, when a court makes a Rowbotham order, it is not conducting some kind 
  of judicial review of decisions made by legal aid authorities. Rather, it is 
  fulfilling its independent obligation to ensure that the accused receives a 
  fair trial.</p>
<p> [23] In this case, there was never any dispute that the respondent required 
  counsel to ensure that he had a fair trial and that he could not fully fund 
  counsel from his own resources. He was therefore granted a contributory<a href="#a">[4]</a><a name="4"></a> 
  legal aid certificate. </p>
<p>
  [24] On the application, the respondent raised two sets of issues. First, he 
  submitted that the legal aid rates were so low that he was denied adequate representation 
  and therefore a fair trial. The application judge found against the respondent 
  and it is no longer an issue in this appeal. The second set of issues concerned 
  the reasonableness of the conditions attached to the legal aid certificate, 
  namely the denial of compensation for travel time and disbursements, the limit 
  on preparation time and the requirement of prior approval for junior counsel. 
  This appeal concerns that second set of issues.</p>
<p>
  [25] In considering these issues, the application judge was, again, not entitled 
  to review the reasonableness of the decisions made by Legal Aid. Her focus had 
  to be on whether the respondent's right to a fair trial was imperilled because 
  of the conditions under which he was being defended. In my view, there was no 
  evidence to support a finding that the respondent's right to a fair trial was 
  at risk.</p>
<p>
  [26] The Charter guarantees to a fair trial and fundamental justice mean that 
  the state must provide funds so that an indigent accused can be represented 
  by counsel where counsel is required to ensure that the accused person has a 
  fair trial. Further, within reason, the court will protect an accused's right 
  to choose his or her counsel. As this court said in R. v. Speid (1984), 43 O.R. 
  (2d) 596 at 598: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The right of an accused to retain counsel of his choice has long been recognized 
  at common law as a fundamental right. It has been carried forth as a singular 
  feature of the Legal Aid Plan in this province and has been inferentially entrenched 
  in the Charter of Rights which guarantees everyone upon arrest or detention 
  the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. However, although it 
  is a fundamental right and one to be zealously protected by the Court, it is 
  not an absolute right and is subject to reasonable limitations.</p>
<p>
  [27] Absent compelling reasons, such as a disqualifying conflict of interest 
  or incompetence, the courts will not interfere with an accused's choice of counsel. 
  Further, the courts will avoid actions that result in accused persons being 
  improperly or unfairly denied the opportunity to be represented by their counsel 
  of choice. See R. v. McCallen (1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 518 (Ont. C.A.) at 531-32.</p>
<p>
  [28] However, the right of an accused person to be free of unreasonable state 
  or judicial interference in his or her choice of counsel does not impose a positive 
  obligation on the state to provide funds for counsel of choice. See R. v. Prosper 
  (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.) at p. 374, R. v. Rockwood (1989), 49 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 129 (N.S.C.A.), R. v. Ho, [2004] 2 W.W.R. 590 (B.C.C.A.), and Attorney 
  General of Quebec v. R.C. (2003), 13 C.R. (6th) 1 (Que. C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [29] There would appear to be two exceptions to this general proposition. First, 
  in some unique situations it may be that an accused can establish that he or 
  she can only obtain a fair trial if represented by a particular counsel. In 
  those unusual circumstances, the court may be entitled to make an order to ensure 
  that the accused is represented by that counsel. This was the case in R. v. 
  Fisher and the genesis of the so-called Fisher order. But in making the order, 
  Milliken J. recognized that he was faced with a unique case, and he suggested 
  at para. 20 that the circumstances that led him to make the order might not 
  occur in Saskatchewan "in another thirty years". </p>
<p>
  [30] Second, in unusual circumstances, the court may find that the accused simply 
  cannot find competent counsel to represent him or her on conditions imposed 
  by Legal Aid. One would expect those cases to be exceedingly rare. For example, 
  if the accused was unable to retain local counsel, Legal Aid would inevitably 
  grant authorization to retain out-of-town counsel. See R. v. Swearengen (December 
  5, 2002, unreported Ont. S.C.J.). Courts in Ontario have, with few exceptions, 
  rejected the proposition that enhanced rates above those authorized by Legal 
  Aid are necessary to ensure that accused receive competent counsel. See R. v. 
  Abu-Taha, [2001] O.J. No. 4278 (S.C.J.), R. v. Montpellier, [2002] O.J. No. 
  4279 (S.C.J.), R. v. Swearengen, and R. v. Magda, [2001] O.J. No. 1861 (S.C.J.).</p>
<p>
  [31] The respondent's case is not unique and it is not of the same order of 
  complexity as the Fisher case. It is an arson case expected to last seven days 
  in which there may be up to thirty Crown witnesses, one of whom was a former 
  accomplice. If this is the level of complexity that would justify a Fisher order, 
  virtually every accused facing a jury trial could claim an entitlement to state-funded 
  counsel of choice. That is simply not the law. As to the respondent's relationship 
  with his counsel, it is not unusual for accused to have prior professional relationships 
  with a lawyer. The fact that counsel had a prior relationship with the respondent 
  and that the respondent had confidence in him similarly did not demonstrate 
  an entitlement to state-funded counsel of choice. See R. v. Bruha, [2003] 1 
  W.W.R. 339 (N.W.T.S.C.). I have set out earlier a paragraph from the affidavit 
  of junior counsel where he attempts to explain the basis for the application. 
  There is nothing in that paragraph that could justify a conclusion that this 
  case was so difficult, and that counsel's relationship with the respondent was 
  so special, that only Mr. Wrock could handle it. </p>
<p>
  [32] This was also not a case where a Fisher-type order was required because 
  the respondent could not otherwise obtain competent counsel. There was no evidence 
  before the application judge that other competent counsel were not available 
  to take the case and to do so on the conditions imposed by Legal Aid. Oral submissions 
  from counsel at the hearing about the number of lawyers in the county was no 
  basis for finding that there were no other competent lawyers available to take 
  the case.</p>
<p>
  [33] Since there was nothing unique about this case and the respondent failed 
  to show that local counsel were not available, the basis for the order would 
  seem to turn on the timing of the application. As I have said, the application 
  judge framed the issue in these terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The issue and the real concern that I have at this point, being April the 3rd, 
  looking at a now fixed trial date of May the 5th, is about the fairness of the 
  trial should these matters not be resolved and should the accused be forced 
  to have to defend himself.</p>
<p>
  [34] She then held that given the trial was to begin in one month, "no 
  other person other than Mr. Wrock could do a fair representation of the accused 
  at [that] stage". In my view, the imminent approach of a trial date could 
  not justify the order made by the application judge. </p>
<p>
  [35] Under the Ontario system, the respondent was entitled to seek out a lawyer 
  willing to accept his legal aid certificate. He sought out Mr. Wrock and Mr. 
  Wrock accepted the certificate. However, Mr. Wrock would require authorization 
  in advance from the area director for travel time, travel expenses and junior 
  counsel. In the circumstances, counsel's professional obligation in December 
  2001 was either to proceed on Legal Aid's terms, or assist his client in finding 
  other competent counsel who was prepared to defend his client.</p>
<p>
  [36] The preliminary inquiry was held in June 2002. It was expected to last 
  seven days. In fact, it lasted only one day because a former accomplice pleaded 
  guilty and then testified for the Crown. The respondent says that it was at 
  that point that the case took on added complexity. Assuming that to be the case, 
  the trial was still some time off. As it turned out, the trial date was almost 
  one year later. At that point, Mr. Wrock and the respondent knew that Mr. Wrock 
  was not going to be paid by Legal Aid for his travel time and expenses. They 
  certainly had no reason to believe at that point that Legal Aid would pay for 
  junior counsel, since Mr. Wrock had not sought prior authorization. The respondent, 
  however, did not seek out other counsel and in the result this application came 
  on for hearing only one month before trial. </p>
<p>
  [37] There was, in any event, no evidence that no other lawyer was available 
  to proceed with the trial on the scheduled trial date. Even if there had been 
  such evidence, it would not follow that the respondent was entitled to the order 
  made by the application judge. The application judge could have adjourned the 
  case to permit the respondent time to retain local counsel. Subsequent events 
  have demonstrated that the respondent is not concerned with or prejudiced by 
  delay of his trial. At his request the trial has in fact now been adjourned 
  for over a year pending the outcome of this appeal. </p>
<p>
  [38] Alternatively, having regard to the circumstances, the application judge 
  could have required Mr. Wrock to proceed with the case since he was on the record 
  and had undertaken to defend the respondent. Rule 2.09(5) of the Rules of Professional 
  Conduct of the Law Society of Upper Canada is clear on this issue: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where a lawyer has agreed to act in a criminal case and where the date set for 
  trial is not far enough removed to enable the client to obtain another lawyer 
  or to enable another lawyer to prepare adequately for trial and an adjournment 
  of the trial date cannot be obtained without adversely affecting the client's 
  interests, the lawyer who agreed to act may not withdraw because of non-payment 
  of fees. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [39] The order made by the application judge was not necessary to ensure that 
  the respondent was properly represented and received a fair trial. There was 
  therefore no basis for making that order and it must be set aside.</p>
<p>
  [40] In light of this conclusion, which is based on the record before the application 
  judge, I need not consider the other grounds of appeal concerning the application 
  judge's refusal to receive the evidence of Mr. Cliffen and the application to 
  receive fresh evidence.</p>
<p>
  [41] I do, however, wish to deal with two further matters. The first issue is 
  the propriety of making an order against Legal Aid Ontario. Even if a case had 
  been made out for a Fisher-type order, the order should have been made against 
  the Crown, not Legal Aid Ontario. It would then be for the Attorney General 
  of Ontario to determine how to respond to the order. He may have been able to 
  make some arrangement with Legal Aid Ontario. But that was a matter for the 
  Attorney General and the Legal Aid authorities. It was not an issue for the 
  criminal court. See Attorney General of Quebec v. R.C. at para. 177.</p>
<p>
  [42] Finally, the application judge made an order that the Crown pay the respondent 
  $500 as costs of the application. The order seems to have been made solely on 
  the basis that costs should follow the event as in civil cases. That is not 
  the rule in indictable matters. See R. v. Leduc (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 321 
  (Ont. C.A.). The trial judge erred in ordering costs against the Crown in this 
  case. There was nothing in the conduct of the case by the Crown that would warrant 
  a costs order.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [43] Accordingly, as was indicated at the conclusion of oral argument, leave 
  to appeal is granted, the appeals by the Crown and Legal Aid Ontario are allowed 
  and the order of the application judge, including the costs order, is quashed.</p>
