<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Joseph B. Wilson of the Ontario Court 
  of Justice dated April 23, 2003.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] The respondent, Darcy Pickles, constructed a dock for the Ravalli family 
  in the township of Seguin. He did not obtain a building permit from the township 
  and was charged with the offence of building without a permit contrary to s. 
  8(1) of the Building Code Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 23 ("the BCA"). 
  Section 36(8) of the BCA establishes a one year limitation period for certain 
  offences, including violations of s. 8(1). The information charging Pickles 
  was sworn thirteen months after the completion of the dock.</p>
<p>
  [2] His Worship Justice of the Peace Michael G. Kitlar dismissed the charge 
  on the basis of the limitation period. His decision was upheld on appeal by 
  Justice Joseph B. Wilson of the Ontario Court of Justice. Morden J.A. of this 
  court granted the Crown leave to appeal Wilson J.'s decision and framed the 
  legal questions as follows: "Does the doctrine of discoverability apply 
  to the offence of constructing without a permit and is this offence a continuing 
  offence?"</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  (1) The parties and the events</p>
<p>
  [3] Darcy Pickles was a building contractor. Sab Ravalli owned a cottage in 
  the township of Seguin. He retained Pickles to build a boathouse. Pickles went 
  to the township's building department and was told that he would need to obtain 
  approval from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans ("DFO") in order 
  to build a boathouse on the Ravalli property.</p>
<p>
  [4] Pickles and Ravalli met Andrea Doherty, a DFO representative, at the cottage. 
  She told them that it would be difficult to obtain approval for a boathouse. 
  However, Doherty told them that they could build a floating dock instead and 
  advised them where they could build it. Ravalli testified that Doherty told 
  them that she would send them a confirming letter within a week. She did not 
  send such a letter. Pickles and Ravalli constructed the dock in July 2000. Pickles 
  did not return to the township's building department to seek a building permit 
  because he thought that DFO's verbal approval through Doherty was sufficient.</p>
<p>
  [5] In August 2001, the municipal authorities became aware of the Ravallis' 
  floating dock. Pickles was charged with building without a permit contrary to 
  s. 8(1) of the BCA: </p>
<p class="indent">
  8(1) No person shall construct&#133;a building&#133;unless a permit has been 
  issued therefor by a building official.</p>
<p>
  (2) The court proceedings</p>
<p>
  [6] The trial took place before His Worship Justice of the Peace Kitlar.</p>
<p>
  [7] The BCA creates three types of offences: </p>
<p class="indent"> 36(1) A person is guilty of an offence if the person,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) knowingly furnishes false information in any application 
  under this Act or in any statement or return required to be furnished under 
  this Act or the regulations;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) fails to comply with an order, direction or other requirement 
  made under this Act; or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) contravenes this Act, the regulations, a by?law passed under 
  section 7 or a condition imposed under section 9.</p>
<p>
  The offence of building without a permit contrary to s. 8(1) comes within s. 
  36(1)(c) of the BCA.</p>
<p>
  [8] The BCA also contains a limitation period for s. 36 offences: </p>
<p class="indent">
  36(8) No proceeding under this section shall be commenced more than one year 
  after the time when the subject?matter of the proceeding arose.</p>
<p>
  [9] The trial judge held that this limitation period compelled the acquittal 
  of Pickles since the Crown had laid the charge against him thirteen months after 
  the dock had been constructed. The appeal to Justice Wilson was dismissed. The 
  Crown sought and obtained leave to appeal to this court.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [10] The issues on appeal are the two set out in Justice Morden's order granting 
  leave to appeal: Does the doctrine of discoverability apply to the offence of 
  constructing without a permit and is this offence a continuing offence?</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [11] The Crown contends that the courts below made two errors: (1) they did 
  not apply the discoverability principle to the limitation period set out in 
  s. 36(8) of the BCA and (2) they did not hold that the offence of building without 
  a permit contrary to s. 8(1) of the BCA is a continuing offence which becomes 
  complete only when a permit is obtained. I will deal with these two submissions 
  in turn.</p>
<p>
  (1) Discoverability</p>
<p>
  [12] Pickles completed construction of the dock in July 2000. The township first 
  became aware of the dock in August 2001. Pickles was charged with building without 
  a permit the same month. The Crown contends that it was the township's 'discovery' 
  that Pickles had built a dock without a permit that triggered the commencement 
  of the s. 36(8) limitation clock. Accordingly, the charge was laid mere days 
  - not thirteen months - after the clock started to run.</p>
<p>
  [13] The discoverability rule is merely a rule of construction. It will apply 
  to some limitation periods, but not to all. This fundamental point, as well 
  as the test for distinguishing between application and non?application scenarios, 
  were explained by Major J. in the leading case Peixeiro v. Haberman, [1997] 
  3 S.C.R. 549 at 564: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In this regard, I adopt Twaddle J.A.'s statement in Fehr v. Jacob (1993), 14 
  C.C.L.T. (2d) 200 (Man. C.A.), at p. 206, that the discoverability rule is an 
  interpretive tool for the construing of limitation statutes which ought to be 
  considered each time a limitations provision is in issue: </p>
<p class="indent10">
  In my opinion, the judge?made discoverability rule is nothing more than a rule 
  of construction. Whenever a statute requires an action to be commenced within 
  a specified time from the happening of a specific event, the statutory language 
  must be construed. When time runs from "the accrual of the cause of action" 
  or from some other event which can be construed as occurring only when the injured 
  party has knowledge of the injury sustained, the judge?made discoverability 
  rule applies. But, when time runs from an event which clearly occurs without 
  regard to the injured party's knowledge, the judge?made discoverability rule 
  may not extend the period the legislature has prescribed.</p>
<p>
  See also: Waschkowski v. Hopkinson Estate (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 370 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [14] In his text Guide to Ontario Building Legislation (Carswell: Scarborough, 
  1996), Richard Arblaster discusses the limitation period set out in s. 36(8) 
  of the BCA. He said, at p. 1?56: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The offence of breaching the Building Code Act or its regulations or by?laws 
  occurs when the offence is committed, as opposed to when discovered, and is 
  also concluded on the day that the activity is question is completed. For example, 
  the offence of building without a permit would be concluded on the last day 
  that work without a permit occurred; building not in conformance with the Building 
  Code would be concluded on the day that the building or construction in question 
  was completed or work ceased. The one?year limitation period would begin to 
  run from that day.</p>
<p>
  [15] I agree with this analysis and conclusion. The event which led to the charge 
  against Pickles (or, in the language of s. 36(8) of the BCA, "the subject 
  matter of the proceeding") was building the dock without a permit. This 
  specific act was completed in July 2000. It was, therefore, the completion of 
  this act that triggered the commencement of the limitation period. There is 
  nothing in the nature of this specific act or in the wording of s. 36(8) of 
  the BCA to suggest that the limitation period commenced at the moment the township 
  'discovered' Pickles' act. Accordingly, the laying of the charge against him 
  thirteen months after he had completed construction of the dock was outside 
  the one year period set out in s. 36(8).</p>
<p>
  [16] Moreover, I note that, in the context of regulatory statutes like the BCA, 
  it is open to the legislature to specifically build the discoverability principle 
  into the wording of a limitation period. An example is s. 129(1) of the Securities 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5: </p>
<p class="indent">
  129(1) No proceeding under this Part shall be commenced in a court more than 
  one year after the facts upon which the proceeding is based first came to the 
  knowledge of the Commission.</p>
<p>
  In the absence of clear legislative language importing the discoverability principle 
  into a statute, I see no reason why the court should expand the reach of the 
  regulatory prohibition by resort to the discoverability principle.</p>
<p>
  (2) Continuing offence</p>
<p>
  [17] The Crown's second submission is that the offence of building without a 
  permit is a continuing offence until a permit is obtained. Since Pickles never 
  obtained a permit, the limitation period did not begin to run before he was 
  charged. In support of this submission, the appellant relies on the decision 
  of Justice Hawke in R. v. Aregers (1997), 38 C.L.R. (2d) 95 (O.C.J.) ("Aregers"), 
  wherein she held that the offence of building without a permit in s. 8(1) of 
  the BCA was not complete until a permit had been issued.</p>
<p>
  [18] I do not agree with the decision in Aregers. I note that leave was sought 
  to appeal it to this court: Shanks v. Aregers (1997), 38 C.L.R. (2d) 101. Charron 
  J.A. refused to grant leave because it was not essential in the public interest 
  or for the due administration of justice that leave be granted: see Provincial 
  Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33, s. 131(2). However, Charron J.A. observed, 
  at para. 7, that she found "much merit in the position advanced by the 
  applicant, particularly with respect to the interpretation given by the appeal 
  court judge [Justice Hawke] to s. 8(1)."</p>
<p>
  [19] In the present case, Wilson J. also declined to follow Aregers. He said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  With respect, I am not of the same view as Justice Hawke in the Aregers case 
  where she stated that the subject matter "is the presence of construction 
  and the issuance of a permit.".&#133;In my opinion, the illegality of Mr. 
  Pickles' actions ended when he finished the project before the end of July 2000 
  and did not continue thereafter. There was nothing further for him to do [emphasis 
  in original].</p>
<p>
  [20] In reaching this conclusion, Wilson J. relied on the decision of this court 
  in R. v. Rutherford (1990), 38 O.A.C. 41 ("Rutherford"). In that case, 
  an electrical contractor was charged with faulty installation of electrical 
  equipment contrary to s. 93(11)(b) of the Power Corporation Act, R.S.O. 1980, 
  c. 384. The charge was laid more than six months after the installation work 
  had been completed. By virtue of s. 76(1) of the Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. 
  1980, c. 400, a six month limitation period applied to the offence.</p>
<p>
  [21] The Crown took the position that because the faulty installation had never 
  been repaired, the offence was a continuing one and the limitation period did 
  not apply. A majority of the court (Morden and Grange JJ.A.) rejected this submission. 
  Grange J.A. stated, at pp. 43 and 44: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is important that we appreciate just exactly what it was that the appellant 
  did that brought about the charges. He installed an improper panelboard and 
  provided improper grounding on the service switch at premises located at Lot 
  35, Concession 5, Darlington Township. All of the work was performed and completed 
  by August 23, 1985.</p>
<p class="center"> . . . . . </p>
<p class="indent"> It is contended by the prosecution that so long as the defect 
  continues, these offences continue and time does not therefore run.</p>
<p class="indent">I cannot accept that contention. The act complained of, in my 
  view, was faulty installation under s. 93(11)(b) of the Power Corporation Act 
  and all of that work was completed on August 23, 1985. The appellant's neglect 
  to comply with the regulation was complete on that date and time under the limitation 
  section of the Provincial Offences Act then started to run.</p>
<p>
  [22] In my view, Wilson J. was correct to rely on Rutherford in the present 
  case. The nature of the offences in the two cases is similar. In both cases, 
  there was a specific act - faulty installation of electrical equipment and construction 
  of a dock without a building permit. In both cases, the consequences of the 
  specific act 'continued' in a sense - the electrical equipment was not repaired 
  and a building permit was never obtained. However, in Rutherford this court 
  held that the completion of the specific act triggered the commencement of the 
  limitation period. As Wilson J. correctly recognized, the same interpretation, 
  and result, should follow in the present case.</p>
<p>
  [23] There is a second feature of Rutherford that, in my view, is telling in 
  this appeal. In his discussion about so?called 'continuing offences', Grange 
  J.A. observed, at p. 45: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is considerably easier to find a continuing offence where the statute provides 
  for a penalty for every day that the corrective work is not done or the offending 
  activity continues to be done. Such a provision is found in s. 93(11)(c) of 
  the Act, which relates to continued disobedience of an order made under s. 93(5). 
  The juxtaposition of this provision in s. 93(11)(c) to the absence of such a 
  provision in s. 93(11)(b) is significant.</p>
<p>
  [24] There is a similar juxtaposition of provisions in the BCA. Indeed, under 
  the specific heading Continuing offence, s. 36(6) of the BCA provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  36(6) Every person who fails to comply with an order made by a chief building 
  official under subsection 14(1) or clause 15(5)(a) is guilty of an offence and 
  on conviction, in addition to the penalties mentioned in subsections (3) and 
  (4), is liable to a fine of not more than $10,000 per day for every day the 
  offence continues after the time given for complying with the order has expired.</p>
<p>
  [25] In my view, it is clear and noteworthy that the legislature specifically 
  addressed the subject of continuing offences in the BCA, and did not include 
  violations of s. 8(1) in its list of such offences.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [26] I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
