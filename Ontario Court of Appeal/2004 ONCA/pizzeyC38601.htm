<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Ronald C. Sills of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 28, 2002.</p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. Introduction</p>
<p>
  [1] A promissory note bears interest at the rate of 10 percent annually up to 
  the date the note matures, but specifies no interest rate after maturity. The 
  principal question on this appeal is what interest rate applies to money still 
  owing after the maturity date. The trial judge held that the applicable rate 
  was 5 percent. He relied on s. 133(b) of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1985, 
  c. B-4, which provides for interest after maturity but does not specify a rate; 
  and on s. 3 of the federal Interest Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-15, which provides 
  that "[w]henever any interest is payable by the agreement of the parties 
  or by law, and no rate is fixed by the agreement or by law, the rate of interest 
  shall be five percent per annum." </p>
<p>
  [2] I take a different view. In my opinion, the applicable annual rate is 10 
  percent because s. 3 of the Interest Act is ousted by the prejudgment interest 
  provisions of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43.</p>
<p>
  B. Background Facts</p>
<p>
  a) The Pizzey family sells its trailer park to the St. Pierre family</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellants, the Pizzey family, held the shares of the respondent Crestwood 
  Lake Limited. Crestwood owns about forty?seven acres of land in Brant County, 
  on which it manages over two hundred trailer park lots.</p>
<p>
  [4] In October 1989 the Pizzey family entered into a written agreement to sell 
  its shares in Crestwood to the respondent members of the St. Pierre family for 
  a purchase price of $1,250,000. The sale closed in March 1990.</p>
<p>
  b) The terms of payment</p>
<p>
  [5] The St. Pierres paid $500,000 of the $1,250,000 purchase price on closing. 
  For the balance of the purchase price the St. Pierres gave the Pizzeys the promissory 
  note in question: a note for $750,000 bearing interest "at the rate of 
  10 percent per annum calculated semiannually not in advance." The note 
  provided that interest would be calculated from March 8, 1990 to the date of 
  maturity, March 8, 1995, "when the total amount of principal and interest 
  shall be fully due and payable." The note made no mention of interest after 
  maturity. </p>
<p>
  [6] As security for the balance of the purchase price, Crestwood guaranteed 
  payments of the promissory note. And Crestwood secured its own guarantee obligation 
  by giving the Pizzeys a $750,000 collateral mortgage on the land. In substance, 
  the terms of the mortgage and the terms of the note were identical with one 
  exception on which the Pizzeys rely: the standard charge terms incorporated 
  into the mortgage provided for interest at 10 percent annually "as well 
  after as before maturity".</p>
<p>
  c) The litigation between the parties</p>
<p>
  [7] In 1993 the St. Pierres sued the Pizzeys for fraud, negligent misrepresentation 
  and breach of contract in connection with the sale. They asked to set aside 
  both the promissory note and the mortgage. They also stopped paying under the 
  note. The Pizzeys then brought an action for $37,500, representing a single 
  interest payment owing under the note and the mortgage. The Pizzeys' action 
  was stayed pending the determination of the St. Pierres' fraud action. That 
  action was tried for nine days before Kent J. </p>
<p>
  [8] In reasons delivered in March 1998, Kent J. dismissed the St. Pierres' claim 
  in fraud and negligent misrepresentation, and he refused to set aside either 
  the note or the mortgage. But he found the Pizzeys liable for breach of contract 
  and assessed damages at $180,000, which included an $80,000 reduction in the 
  purchase price. He also held that "[t]he damages to which St. Pierre is 
  entitled may be set off against the balance overdue under the mortgage back 
  to which Pizzey is entitled."</p>
<p>
  [9] The St. Pierres' appeal to this court was dismissed. Their application for 
  leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was also dismissed. However, 
  their default on the note and the mortgage continued. </p>
<p>
  [10] In September 1999, the Pizzeys brought a mortgage action against the St. 
  Pierres and Crestwood claiming principal and interest owing of over $1.4 million. 
  In their defence, the St. Pierres for the first time took the position that 
  after the maturity date of the note in March 1995, interest accrued on the outstanding 
  balance at only 5 percent annually. The Pizzeys then sought leave to discontinue 
  their action, and instead to appoint a receiver and manager over the trailer 
  park land. The St. Pierres, in turn, brought a motion to determine whether the 
  post?maturity rate of interest on the balance owing under the promissory note 
  was 5 percent or 10 percent. These two proceedings were heard by Sills J. and 
  resulted in the order now under appeal. </p>
<p>
  d) The reasons of the trial judge</p>
<p>
  [11] The trial judge appropriately considered that the main issue before him 
  was the applicable post?maturity interest rate. The Pizzeys put forward two 
  arguments in support of their submission that the rate was 10 percent. First, 
  they argued that the terms of the mortgage gave them the right to interest at 
  10 percent after maturity. Second, they argued that s. 3 of the Interest Act, 
  which sets a 5 percent interest rate where no rate is fixed by the parties or 
  by law, did not apply because of the interest provisions in either the mortgage 
  or the Courts of Justice Act. </p>
<p>
  [12] The trial judge rejected both of the Pizzeys' arguments. He found that 
  the "sole debt instrument" was the promissory note and that, therefore, 
  the terms of the note dictated the rate of interest after maturity. He also 
  found that interest on the note after maturity was payable by law under s. 133(b) 
  of the Bills of Exchange Act. Because that section did not specify a rate of 
  interest, s. 3 of the Interest Act filled the gap by specifying a rate of 5 
  percent. The Pizzeys have appealed both these findings to this court. </p>
<p>
  [13] The trial judge also held that he had good grounds to appoint a receiver 
  over the trailer park property unless the St. Pierres paid the undisputed amount 
  owing under the note. They did pay. Thus, the dispute in this court is over 
  the applicable post?maturity interest rate. The amount at stake is approximately 
  $580,000. </p>
<p>
  C. Analysis</p>
<p>
  a) Did the trial judge err in the way he characterized the nature of the transaction?</p>
<p>[14] The Pizzeys submit that the trial judge erred in characterizing the promissory 
  note as the "sole debt instrument". They contend that the mortgage 
  creates a separate debt obligation that is complementary rather than subordinate 
  to the note. In support of their contention they point to the ninth standard 
  charge term, which provides that no "other dealing by the Chargee with 
  the owner or owners of the said lands...shall in any way affect or prejudice 
  the rights of the Chargee against the Chargor". I do not accept the Pizzeys' 
  submission.</p>
<p>
  [15] Faced with the two inconsistent interest obligations in the note and the 
  mortgage, the trial judge had to determine which obligation the St. Pierres 
  were required to meet. That determination turned on how he characterized the 
  nature of the transaction. He characterized the transaction as a share purchase, 
  paid for by cash and a promissory note, with the note guaranteed by Crestwood 
  and Crestwood's guarantee secured by a collateral mortgage on the property. 
  Thus, the trial judge found that the St. Pierres' debt obligation was found 
  in the note, not the mortgage. </p>
<p>
  [16] The trial judge's characterization of the transaction is a finding of mixed 
  fact and law. It is therefore entitled to some deference on appeal. I see no 
  basis to reverse that finding. Indeed, it is supported by the documentation. 
  </p>
<p>
  [17] First, the agreement of purchase and sale stipulates that the purchase 
  price consists of the down payment and "take back financing" in the 
  form of the promissory note secured by Crestwood's mortgage. The St. Pierres 
  are not parties to the mortgage and, thus, the Pizzeys have no claim against 
  them under the mortgage. Second, the mortgage provides that "[p]ayment 
  of the note is payment of the mortgage and payment of the mortgage is payment 
  of the note". Therefore, once the St. Pierres (or Crestwood) have paid 
  off the promissory note, Crestwood is entitled to a discharge of the mortgage. 
  For these reasons I would not interfere with the trial judge's finding that 
  the promissory note alone governs the St. Pierres' debt obligation. That leaves 
  the central question on this appeal, the application of s. 3 of the Interest 
  Act. </p>
<p>
  b) Does s. 3 of the Interest Act supply the rate of interest after maturity?</p>
<p>
  [18] In my view, whether s. 3 of the Interest Act supplies the post?maturity 
  rate turns on the effect of s. 133(b) of the Bills of Exchange Act, ss. 128(1) 
  and 130 of the Courts of Justice Act, which are laws for the payment of interest, 
  and s. 128(4)(g) of the Courts of Justice Act, which prescribes when s. 128(1) 
  does not apply. </p>
<p>
  i) The traditional approach</p>
<p>
  [19] As I have said, the promissory note does not specify a post?maturity rate 
  of interest. Accordingly, the trial judge turned to ss. 186(1) and 133(b) of 
  the Bills of Exchange Act. Section 186(1) states that the provisions of the 
  Act relating to bills apply to promissory notes. Section 133(b) provides that 
  when a bill is dishonoured - and thus when a note is dishonoured - the measure 
  of damages includes interest after maturity. But s. 133(b) does not specify 
  a rate of interest: </p>
<p class="indent"> Where a bill is dishonoured, the measure of damages, which 
  shall be deemed to be liquidated damages, are...</p>
<p class="indent">(b) interest thereon from the time of presentment for payment, 
  if the bill is payable on demand, and from the maturity of the bill in any other 
  case...</p>
<p>
  [20] Because s. 133(b) of the Bills of Exchange Act is a law for the payment 
  of interest but does not specify the rate of interest, the trial judge held 
  that s. 3 of the Interest Act applied and fixed the rate at 5 percent: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Whenever any interest is payable by the agreement of parties or by law, and 
  no rate is fixed by the agreement or by law, the rate of interest shall be five 
  percent per annum. </p>
<p>
  [21] The trial judge's holding finds support in nineteenth and early twentieth 
  century Supreme Court of Canada case law and in the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal's 
  decision in Toronto?Dominion Bank v. Mr. Klean Enterprises Ltd. (1987), 37 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 717. In Hossack v. Shaw (1918), 56 S.C.R. 581 at 585 Anglin J. summarized 
  the early Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A stipulation for interest at a certain rate on a loan "until paid" 
  is established by a long series of cases, of which it is needful to refer only 
  to St. John v. Rykert (1884), 10 S.C.R. 278 and People's Loan and Deposit Co. 
  v. Grant (1890), 18 S.C.R. 262, in this court, to import a contract to pay interest 
  at the specified rate only until the maturity of the loan. To carry the contract 
  for the stipulated rate beyond the maturity of the loan explicit provision to 
  that effect must be made. It follows that after the maturity of the several 
  obligations taken by the plaintiffs (including any renewals which specified 
  the rate of interest) the defendants were under no contractual liability to 
  pay interest at the high rate agreed upon. They were liable only for the statutory 
  rate of 5%. </p>
<p>
  [22] In Mr. Klean Enterprises, Bayda C.J.S. relied on this jurisprudence in 
  holding that the rate of interest on a dishonoured promissory note that does 
  not specify a rate is the statutory rate under the Interest Act. Although he 
  recognized a competing line of authority in which the Supreme Court (and the 
  Privy Council) in breach of contract cases had exercised discretion to grant 
  a fair prejudgment interest rate, he held that this line of authority did not 
  apply to dishonoured notes. See Toronto R. Co. v. City of Toronto, [1906] A.C. 
  117 and Prince Albert Pulp Co. Ltd. v. Foundation Co. of Canada Ltd., [1977] 
  1 S.C.R. 200. Bayda C.J.S. discussed the two lines of authority at pages 723-724 
  of Mr. Klean Enterprises: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The attentive reader might wonder what underlays the distinction we have seen 
  emerge between the two lines of cases: that is, if a debt arises from a breach 
  of contract or other similar obligation, the courts have exercised a discretion 
  in the granting of prejudgment interest; if, however, a debt arises from a promissory 
  note, the courts have awarded nothing more than the statutory rate from the 
  date of the maturity of the note or the date of the demand.</p>
<p class="center"> ...</p>
<p class="indent"> The common law of prejudgment interest is found in the cases 
  that follow from Toronto Railway: the rate and duration of such interest as 
  damages is determined on the basis of what the court thinks is fair and equitable. 
  With respect to bills of exchange (which include, by virtue of s. 186(1) of 
  the Bills of Exchange Act, promissory notes), however, the Legislature has determined 
  that the rate of prejudgment interest ought to be the statutory rate, i.e., 
  5% per annum. Section 134 [now s. 133] is a law that provides for interest, 
  without providing a rate of such interest, within the meaning of the Interest 
  Act. The effect of the combined operation of s. 134 of the Bills of Exchange 
  Act and s. 3 of the Interest Act is that the measure of interest as damages 
  in a case of a dishonoured promissory note must be the statutory rate. This 
  conclusion is consistent with cases from the Supreme Court of Canada and this 
  court spanning over 100 years [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  ii) Is the traditional approach correct?</p>
<p>
  [23] The question whether the 5 percent rate in the Interest Act applies is 
  a question of law. The applicable standard of review, therefore, is correctness. 
  I consider the holding of the trial judge - and by extension, that of the Saskatchewan 
  Court of Appeal - to be incorrect for two reasons.</p>
<p>
  The impact of modern provincial interest legislation</p>
<p> [24] The main reason is that it does not take account of modern provincial 
  prejudgment interest legislation, in Ontario's case ss. 128 to 130 of the Courts 
  of Justice Act. Section 128(1) provides that a person entitled to an order for 
  the payment of money is entitled to an award of interest at the prejudgment 
  interest rate (as defined in the statute)<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  : </p>
<p class="indent">
  A person who is entitled to an order for the payment of money is entitled to 
  claim and have included in the order an award of interest thereon at the prejudgment 
  interest rate, calculated from the date the cause of action arose to the date 
  of the order. </p>
<p>
  Section 130 gives the court discretion to vary the prejudgment interest rate 
  where the "circumstances of the case" so require.</p>
<p>
  [25] Because ss. 128(1) and 130 are laws for the payment of interest, looked 
  at alone, they oust the application of the default rate in s. 3 of the Interest 
  Act. However, the St. Pierres submit that the Courts of Justice Act cannot be 
  used to fix the post?maturity rate on the note because of s. 128(4)(g) of the 
  Courts of Justice Act. Section 128(4) lists a series of exceptions where prejudgment 
  interest under s. 128(1) shall not be awarded. Here, the relevant exception 
  is s. 128(4)(g): </p>
<p class="indent">
  Interest shall not be awarded under subsection (1)</p>
<p class="center">
  ...</p>
<p class="indent"> (g) where interest is payable by a right other than under this 
  section.</p>
<p>
  Section 129(5) provides a similar exception for post judgment interest. The 
  St. Pierres say that interest on the note is payable by s. 133(b) of the Bills 
  of Exchange Act, which is "a right other than under this section." 
  Therefore s. 3 of the Interest Act, not s. 128(1) to s. 130 of the Courts of 
  Justice Act, supplies the post?maturity rate on the note. I do not agree with 
  this submission. </p>
<p>
  [26] At bottom, this is a question of legislative intent: what kinds of interest 
  provisions did the legislature intend should oust the application of the interest 
  provisions of the Courts of Justice Act? As I view it, an interest provision 
  that prescribes a rate or method of calculating interest inconsistent with or 
  more appropriate than s. 128(1) would be an "other right" triggering 
  s. 128(4)(g). But an interest provision, such as s. 133(b) or the Bills of Exchange 
  Act, that does not provide either a rate or a method of calculation and that, 
  therefore, can coexist with s. 128(1) is not a "right other than under" 
  s. 128(1). In other words, s. 133(b) is not a code for the payment of interest. 
  Recent case law in the Supreme Court of Canada and in this court supports my 
  view. </p>
<p>
  [27] The main case is the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Bank of America 
  Canada v. Mutual Trust Co., [2002] 2 S.C.R. 601. That case is the reverse of 
  the present case, because there the Supreme Court relied on the exceptions in 
  s. 128(4)(g) and s. 129(5) to award interest that fairly compensated the lender. 
  </p>
<p>
  [28] In the Bank of America Canada case Mutual Trust breached its agreement 
  to advance long?term mortgage financing and was found liable for damages for 
  breach of contract. The question the Supreme Court of Canada had to resolve 
  was whether the plaintiff bank was entitled to compound interest on its damages 
  award. The Courts of Justice Act did not assist the plaintiff because s. 128(4)(b) 
  prohibits an award of compound interest. The court, therefore, turned to the 
  common law. </p>
<p>
  [29] Under the line of authority referred to by Bayda C.J.S. in Mr. Klean the 
  court unquestionably had the right at common law to award simple interest, because 
  interest was included in an award of expectation damages for breach of contract. 
  Major J. went further, however, and held that the common law right to expectation 
  damages included the right to receive compound interest. Moreover, he held that 
  this right to receive compound interest at common law was an "other right" 
  under ss. 128(4)(g) and 129(5) of the Courts of Justice Act. </p>
<p>
  [30] Major J. emphasized the commercial unfairness of concluding otherwise. 
  He wrote at paras. 45-46: </p>
<p class="indent"> If the court was unable to award compound interest on the breach 
  of a loan which itself bore compound interest, it would be unable to adequately 
  award the plaintiff the value he or she would have received had the contract 
  been performed. To keep the common law current with the evolution of society 
  and to resolve the inconsistency between awarding expectation damages and the 
  courts' past unwillingness to award compound interest, that unwillingness should 
  be discarded in cases requiring that remedy for the plaintiff to realize the 
  benefit of his or her contract. </p>
<p class="indent">A contrary rule would lead to inequity and provide incentives 
  to breach contracts.</p>
<p>
  [31] The principle governing when a court should award interest under the Courts 
  of Justice Act and when it should invoke the exception in s. 128(4)(g) and s. 
  129(5) is found in para. 40 of Major J.'s reasons: </p>
<p class="indent"> Sections 128(4)(g), 129(5) and 130 CJA, each of which allows 
  the judge to award interest other than as specifically set out in ss. 128 and 
  129, clearly indicate that the rates and calculation methods of interest provided 
  in ss. 128 and 129 are applicable in the absence of more appropriate rates and 
  methods of calculation. Section 130 allows a court, where it considers it just, 
  to vary the interest rate or the time for which interest may be awarded. Sections 
  128(4)(g) and 129(5) allow a court to award pre?judgment and post?judgment interest, 
  respectively, where interest is payable by another right [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="indent">I read this passage to mean that the exception in s. 128(4)(g) 
  applies only when the "other right" contains a rate of interest or method of 
  calculation more appropriate than or inconsistent with s. 128(1) of the Courts 
  of Justice Act. Compound interest was a more appropriate rate and the common 
  law right to award it ousted the interest provisions of the Courts of Justice 
  Act. </p>
<p>
  [32] This court implicitly applied this principle in Diefenbacher v. Young (1995), 
  22 O.R. 3d 641 where it considered the relationship between s. 128(4)(g) of 
  the Courts of Justice Act and s. 42 of the Partnerships Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  P.5. Section 42 stipulates that where a person ceases to be a partner of a firm 
  and the partnership carries on, the outgoing partner may elect either a share 
  of the profits or interest at 5 percent on his or her share of the partnership 
  assets. In Diefenbacher, the plaintiff, the outgoing partner, successfully claimed 
  a share of the firm's goodwill. One of the issues before this court was the 
  appropriate prejudgment interest rate on the plaintiff's award. </p>
<p>
  [33] Carthy J.A. found that the trial judge had decided that the outgoing partner 
  was not entitled to his share of the partnership profits. He therefore had to 
  accept the "anachronistic" 5 percent interest rate in the statute. 
  Section 42 constituted an "other right" under s. 128(4)(g) of the 
  Courts of Justice Act. Carthy J.A. inferred that the legislature did not intend 
  s. 128(1) of the Courts of Justice Act to oust s. 42 of the Partnerships Act, 
  because s. 42 not only provided for interest, but also specified a rate. The 
  two provisions were inconsistent and could not coexist. </p>
<p>
  [34] Here, in contrast to Diefenbacher, s. 133(b) of the Bills of Exchange Act 
  and s. 128(1) are not inconsistent. Because s. 133(b) does not specify a rate 
  or method of calculating a rate, the two provisions can live together. Each 
  provision entitles the Pizzeys to post?maturity interest, but only the Courts 
  of Justice Act supplies the rate.</p>
<p>
  [35] To repeat what Major J. said in Bank of America Canada, the rates in the 
  Courts of Justice Act apply in the absence of more appropriate rates and methods 
  of calculation. Therefore, consistent with the reasoning in the Bank of America 
  Canada and Diefenbacher cases, s. 133(b) does not trigger the exception in s. 
  128(4)(g). Section 133(b) is not a "right other than under this section". 
  Accordingly, the prejudgment interest provisions of the Courts of Justice Act 
  oust the application of s. 3 of the Interest Act.</p>
<p>
  [36] Also, awarding interest under the Courts of Justice Act in this case gives 
  effect to the same considerations that underlie the Bank of America Canada decision: 
  assuring a rate of interest that accords with commercial realty and preventing 
  the St. Pierres from relying on their own default to obtain a lower rate. </p>
<p>
  Modern Supreme Court interpretations of the Interest Act</p>
<p>
  [37] The second reason why I disagree with the trial judge's holding is that 
  it fails to give effect to the rationale underlying the more modern Supreme 
  Court of Canada case law on s. 3 of the Interest Act, first discussed in the 
  Prince Albert Pulp Co. case, supra, and later affirmed in British Pacific Properties 
  Ltd. v. British Columbia (Minister of Highways and Public Works), [1980] 2 S.C.R. 
  283 at 289-90. That rationale is to narrow the scope of s. 3 to the rare case, 
  if any, where a court or statutory body cannot legitimately award interest. 
  In the British Pacific Properties case the court put it this way: </p>
<p class="indent"> The fact that there may be a discretion to award or not to 
  award interest does not alter my view that, where the discretion is exercised 
  affirmatively by a judge under statutory authority, and a rate is fixed by him, 
  the result is to exclude s. 3 of the Interest Act, if otherwise applicable....</p>
<p class="indent">I would apply a liberal construction to the words "fixed by 
  law" so as to embrace the establishment of a rate of interest by virtue of a 
  statute or under its provisions when the resulting rate is a binding one upon 
  those affected by it. I would regard s. 3 of the Interest Act as applicable 
  only when there is no provision made in an applicable statute or in an agreement 
  and no mechanism is provided by which a rate can be fixed [emphasis added]. 
</p>
<p>
  The last sentence of this passage, which I have underlined, also confirms that 
  s. 3 of the Interest Act cannot apply in the face of provisions such as ss. 
  128(1) to 130 of the Courts of Justice Act, which provide for interest and a 
  mechanism to fix a rate. See also the discussion in M.A. Waldron, The Law of 
  Interest in Canada (Scarborough: Carswell, 1992) at 82-84. </p>
<p>
  c) The Appropriate Rate</p>
<p>
  [38] The last question that needs to be determined is what prejudgment interest 
  rate should be awarded after maturity of the note. The statutory prejudgment 
  interest rate under s. 128(1) of the Courts of Justice Act is 4.8 percent. </p>
<p>
  [39] However, s. 130 gives the court discretion to vary the prejudgment interest 
  rate where the "circumstances of the case" so require. Here, the appropriate 
  post?maturity rate is the same as the pre?maturity rate on the note, 10 percent. 
  This is consistent with the reasoning of Major J. in the Bank of America Canada 
  case at paras. 49-50: </p>
<p class="indent"> Absent exceptional circumstances, the interest rate which had 
  governed the loan prior to breach would be the appropriate rate to govern the 
  post?breach loan. The application of a lower interest rate would be unjust to 
  the lender.</p>
<p class="indent">This analysis applies equally to pre-judgment interest and post-judgment 
  interest.</p>
<p>
  I would therefore award prejudgment interest on the note at 10 percent per annum. 
  </p>
<p>
  [40] Finally, on the view I take of this appeal, it is unnecessary to address 
  the Pizzeys' submission on res judicata arising from the judgment of Kent J. 
  Res judicata was not raised before the trial judge and therefore I decline to 
  consider it on appeal. </p>
<p>
  D. Conclusion</p>
<p>
  [41] In my opinion, the trial judge erred in awarding interest on the note after 
  maturity at the 5 percent rate provided for in the Interest Act. The appropriate 
  rate after maturity is the rate before maturity stipulated in the note, 10 percent. 
  Sections 128(1) and 130(1) of the Courts of Justice Act authorize this post?maturity 
  rate. Therefore, the 5 percent rate in s. 3 of the Interest Act does not apply.</p>
<p>
  [42] I would allow the appeal and vary the judgment of Sills J. by deleting 
  the words "the statutory rate of 5 percent per annum" in paragraph 
  1, and in their place inserting the words "10 percent per annum". 
  </p>
<p>
  [43] Lastly, I deal with costs. The trial judge awarded costs to the St. Pierres 
  on a partial indemnity basis in paragraph 5 of his judgment. I would reverse 
  that order and award the Pizzeys their costs of the proceedings before Sills 
  J. on a partial indemnity basis. In light of the hours spent, I would fix those 
  costs at $20,000 plus disbursements and G.S.T. The Pizzeys are also entitled 
  to their costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity basis. I would fix those 
  costs at $15,000 plus disbursements and G.S.T. </p>

<p>
  WEILER J.A. (concurring): </p>
<p>
  [44] I have had the benefit of reading the draft reasons of Laskin J.A. and 
  I agree with him that the trial judge erred in awarding interest at the rate 
  of five per cent on the promissory note in question after the note matured. 
  I agree, too, that the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 can be used 
  to fix the post-maturity rate on the note at ten percent because it does not 
  conflict with the combined effect of s. 133(b) of the Bills of Exchange Act, 
  R.S.C. 1985, c. B-4 and s. 3 of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-15. </p>
<p>
  [45] I would also hold that there is an alternative route to arriving at the 
  conclusion that the post-maturity rate of interest on the promissory note is 
  10%. This alternative method assumes that section 128(1) of the Courts of Justice 
  Act, which gives a person entitled to the payment of money the right to prejudgment 
  interest, does not apply because interest is payable pursuant to section 133(b) 
  of the Bills of Exchange Act. The question is, therefore, what the rate of interest 
  should be. </p>
<p>
  [46] Section 3 of the Interest Act fixing interest at five percent only applies 
  when there is no agreement, statute, or mechanism provided to fix the rate: 
  British Pacific Properties Ltd. v. British Columbia (Minister of Highways and 
  Public Works), [1980] 2 S.C.R. 283 at 289-90. In my opinion, however, the common 
  law provides the mechanism to fix the rate. In Bank of America Canada v. Mutual 
  Trust Co., [2002] 2 S.C.R. 601, the court was dealing with a loan that provided 
  for compound interest prior to maturity and the issue was whether compound interest 
  should apply after maturity. The Court held at para. 49: </p>
<p class="indent">
  With respect to the failure to repay the loan in this appeal when due, it cannot 
  be said that the cost of such delay was not in the contemplation of both parties 
  at the time they made the contract&#133;. A loan agreement with a specified 
  interest rate is an agreement between parties on the cost of borrowing money 
  over a period of time. Absent exceptional circumstances, the interest rate which 
  had governed the loan prior to breach would be the appropriate rate to govern 
  the post-breach loan. The application of a lower interest rate would be unjust 
  to the lender [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [47] In holding as it did, the Supreme Court rejected the traditional approach 
  that the rate of interest on a loan after maturity had to be stipulated. Further, 
  absent exceptional circumstances, the rate of interest that was fair and equitable 
  was the rate that governed the loan beforehand and should govern the loan after 
  default. </p>
<p>
  [48] In Toronto Dominion Bank v. Mr. Klean Enterprises Ltd. et al. (1987), 37 
  D.L.R. 717 (Sask. C.A.), Bayda C.J.S., drew a distinction between interest payable 
  when there had been default on a loan and when there had been default in payment 
  of a promissory note. In the former, he acknowledged that the court fixes a 
  rate that it thinks is fair and equitable. In the latter, he held the combined 
  operation of s. 134 of the Bills of Exchange Act and s. 3 of the Interest Act 
  prevent anything other than the statutory rate of five percent being imposed. 
  </p>
<p>
  [49] We respectfully disagree with Mr. Klean Enterprises. In his reasons, Laskin 
  J.A. gives two reasons why there should be no distinction in principle with 
  respect to post default interest payable on a loan and post-maturity interest 
  on a promissory note. The first is that such a distinction ignores modern provincial 
  prejudgment interest legislation such as the Courts of Justice Act. The Courts 
  of Justice Act then becomes the focus of his judgment. </p>
<p>
  [50] The second reason derives from the same considerations that underlie the 
  Bank of America Canada decision. Simply, if a lesser rate of interest is imposed 
  after maturity than before maturity this does not accord with commercial reality 
  and a defaulting party would gain an advantage as a result of his or her default. 
  That is unfair and does not provide a principled basis for distinguishing default 
  on a loan from a promissory note that has matured and remains unpaid. </p>
<p>
  [51] Adopting this second reason as the basis for my alternative conclusion, 
  I would apply Bank of America Canada to the promissory note in question and 
  hold that, based on the evolution of the common law, the rate of interest after 
  maturity is the same as that before maturity, namely, ten percent, as no exceptional 
  circumstances have been shown. Accordingly s. 3 of the Interest Act would not 
  apply.</p>
<p>
  [52] For these reasons I would also dispose of the appeal as Laskin J.A. has.</p>
