<p>On appeal from the related orders of Justice James M. Farley of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated July 2, 2001, November 28, 2001 and December 27, 2001 
  in Toronto. </p>
<p>ABELLA J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal from a series of orders, including a receiving order, 
  made in bankruptcy proceedings against Robert Platt. The basis for the appeal 
  is that there is fresh evidence to support the theory, propounded by Mr. Platt 
  throughout, that the proceedings were initiated to extinguish his contested 
  interest in a valuable mining claim. </p>
<p>
  [2] This appeal was heard together with the appeal in Boudreau v. Marler. Both 
  decisions are being released concurrently.</p>
<p>
  BACKGROUND </p>
<p>
  [3] The background of this litigation is inordinately complex but indispensable 
  to an understanding of the issues in the appeal.</p>
<p>
  The China Wars Litigation</p>
<p>
  [4] In the late 1980s, Mr. Platt owned mining claims for kaolin, an industrial 
  mineral (the Kaolin Claims). He and Jacobus Hanemaayer were partners in a controlling 
  interest in Great Lakes Nickel Ltd., a public company incorporated to own and 
  develop the Kaolin Claims.</p>
<p>
  [5] Mr. Hanemaayer and his lawyer, Eric Kraushaar, incorporated 798839 Ontario 
  Ltd. (39 Ltd.), which obtained an option from Mr. Platt to purchase the Kaolin 
  Claims subject to a right of reversion. </p>
<p>
  [6] In the spring of 1989, a kaolin deposit was confirmed. However, on December 
  8, 1989, 39 Ltd. informed Mr. Platt that it was terminating work on the Kaolin 
  Claims. This event, according to Mr. Platt, triggered his reversionary right. 
  </p>
<p>
  [7] In March 1990, Mr. Hanemaayer and 39 Ltd. sued Mr. Platt, his business partner, 
  Andre Boudreau, James Bay Kaolin Corp. (JBK), and others for $14 million on 
  the basis that funds advanced to Mr. Platt and JBK had not been spent on exploration 
  and development of the Kaolin Claims as they should have been (the 1990 Hanemaayer 
  Action). </p>
<p>
  [8] In June 1993, Mr. Platt and others sued Mr. Hanemaayer, Mr. Kraushaar, 39 
  Ltd., Great Lakes Nickel Ltd., and others to obtain the return of the Kaolin 
  Claims (the 1993 Platt Action). </p>
<p>
  [9] Since 1994, Farley J. has case managed both the 1990 Hanemaayer Action and 
  the 1993 Platt Action, litigation he refers to as the "China Wars". 
  This litigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>
  The Platt Mortgage Proceedings</p>
<p>
  [10] Mr. Platt also had an interest in Gregor Goldfields Corp. (Gregor), a public 
  mining corporation. In 1992, Mr. Boudreau and John Wiebe became involved in 
  Gregor. In anticipation of an advance of funds from them, Mr. Platt gave Murrayfield 
  Corp. (Murrayfield), the company controlled by Mr. Wiebe, a collateral mortgage 
  on his Cochrane, Ontario home for $80,000. In January 1993, Mr. Platt transferred, 
  in trust, his share position in Gregor to Murrayfield for "pooling purposes". 
  In 1996 and 1997, Mr. Wiebe sold Mr. Platt's shares in Gregor for cash proceeds 
  of at least $91,895. </p>
<p>
  [11] In 1993, Murrayfield assigned the mortgage on Mr. Platt's home to Betty 
  Jane Wheeler as security for a personal loan that she advanced to Mr. Wiebe 
  in the amount of $45,000. Mr. Wiebe did not inform Mr. Platt of the assignment. 
  </p>
<p>
  [12] In October 1998, Murrayfield's then solicitor, Wayne Gray, issued power 
  of sale proceedings with respect to Mr. Platt's home, alleging default under 
  the mortgage. On December 15, 1998, Ms. Wheeler transferred the mortgage back 
  to Murrayfield. </p>
<p>
  [13] In separate proceedings commenced by him against Murrayfield and Ms. Wheeler, 
  Mr. Platt successfully moved before Boissonneault J. in Cochrane on March 10, 
  1999 to have the mortgage discharged from title on the basis that no funds were 
  owing under it. No one appeared for Murrayfield on the motion.</p>
<p>
  [14] Mr. Wiebe then commenced foreclosure proceedings in Toronto, retaining 
  Jonathan Marler as counsel for Murrayfield. Mr. Wiebe assigned the mortgage 
  to Mr. Marler on March 26, 1999, again without informing Mr. Platt. Mr. Marler 
  registered the assignment of the mortgage on title almost one and a half years 
  later, on November 6, 2000. </p>
<p>
  [15] On April 1, 1999, one week after Murrayfield had assigned the mortgage 
  to him, Mr. Marler moved before Boissonneault J. on behalf of both Murrayfield's 
  predecessor company and Ms. Wheeler to have the mortgage reinstated on title. 
  Boissonneault J. set aside his previous order and directed that a trial take 
  place in the proceedings commenced by Mr. Platt, once cross-examinations on 
  the parties' affidavits had been completed.</p>
<p>
  The Boudreau Mortgage Action</p>
<p>
  [16] In November 2000, in an attempt to collect on 1996 and 1997 judgments against 
  Murrayfield, Mr. Boudreau instructed the sheriff to seize Murrayfield's interest 
  in the mortgaged property and have it sold under writ of seizure and sale. Mr. 
  Boudreau learned that the assignment of the mortgage to Mr. Marler had been 
  registered on title the day before the attempted seizure.</p>
<p>
  [17] Mr. Boudreau then commenced an action on March 5, 2001 against Mr. Wiebe, 
  Murrayfield, and Mr. Marler, alleging that the assignment of the Cochrane mortgage 
  from Murrayfield to Mr. Marler was made "with the intent to defeat, hinder, 
  delay, or defraud the plaintiff from collecting the funds owing to him under 
  the [judgments] previously obtained by him." </p>
<p>
  [18] On March 18, 2002, Mr. Boudreau was successful in his mortgage action before 
  Nadeau J., who found that the assignment of the mortgage from Murrayfield to 
  Mr. Marler was a fraudulent conveyance under the Fraudulent Conveyances Act, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. F.29 and an unlawful preference under the Assignments and Preferences 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. A.33. The assignment was therefore declared void and set 
  aside. An appeal by Mr. Marler from that judgment was heard by this court at 
  the same time as this appeal. In a separate decision released together with 
  these reasons, that appeal was dismissed.</p>
<p>
  The Platt Bankruptcy Litigation</p>
<p>
  [19] On June 9, 1999, Murrayfield, 39 Ltd. (for an unpaid costs award), and 
  Ersen Cogulu issued a petition in bankruptcy against Mr. Platt, which put on 
  hold the trial ordered by Boissonneault J. in the Platt mortgage proceedings. 
  </p>
<p>
  [20] When Mr. Platt sought security for costs against Mr. Cogulu, Mr. Cogulu 
  withdrew from the bankruptcy litigation. He was replaced as a petitioning creditor 
  by Kaarina Malmstrom, a former employee of 39 Ltd. </p>
<p>
  [21] By letter to Mr. Platt dated June 18, 1999, Mr. Marler offered to settle 
  the Platt mortgage proceedings for $8,000. Mr. Marler wrote that other creditors 
  were filing in the bankruptcy litigation and that "[i]f Mr. Platt wishes 
  to get out of the boondogle he has created by the filing of this application, 
  I suggest that he settles his differences with Mr. Wiebe immediately." 
  Mr. Platt argued that this letter represented a threat to put him in bankruptcy 
  unless he settled the Platt mortgage proceedings on Mr. Marler's terms. </p>
<p>
  [22] On June 21, 1999, Mr. Platt delivered a notice disputing the bankruptcy 
  petition. He claimed that the petition had been brought by 39 Ltd. and its principals 
  for a collateral purpose, namely, to eliminate him as a litigant in the China 
  Wars litigation over the Kaolin Claims. </p>
<p>
  [23] On December 17, 1999, Mr. Platt's counsel informed the bankruptcy court 
  that Murrayfield's claim regarding the mortgage was disputed and would require 
  several days of hearing. As a result, Murrayfield withdrew as a petitioning 
  creditor and the bankruptcy proceedings were adjourned. This left 39 Ltd. and 
  Ms. Malmstrom as petitioning creditors.</p>
<p>
  [24] Prior to the Platt bankruptcy litigation, Mr. Platt, JBK, and others were 
  ordered to pay legal costs of $9,895.44 to 39 Ltd. and Mr. Hanemaayer, and $2,196.56 
  to Mr. Kraushaar in connection with the China Wars litigation. On February 4, 
  2000, immediately before the bankruptcy hearing, JBK's solicitor paid these 
  costs by certified cheque. As well, a cheque for $1,525.88 was delivered to 
  Ms. Malmstrom, representing an amount owed under an outstanding judgment against 
  Mr. Platt, with a letter explaining that Mr. Platt did not accept personal responsibility 
  for the debt but wished to have the judgment satisfied. About one month earlier, 
  Mr. Platt had informed the court through his counsel that he wished to pay Ms. 
  Malmstron's debt. Mr. Marler had advised the court that Ms. Malmstrom would 
  not accept payment from Mr. Platt.</p>
<p>
  [25] Ms. Malmstrom, 39 Ltd., Mr. Hanemaayer, and Mr. Kraushaar refused to accept 
  the payments. Instead, the cheques were turned over to a trustee nominated by 
  Mr. Marler. Mr. Platt argued that the decision to turn over the cheques to a 
  trustee was a deliberate - and successful - attempt to have Mr. Kraushaar and 
  Mr. Hanemaayer (through 39 Ltd.) participate in the Platt bankruptcy litigation, 
  thereby allowing them to control the resolution of the China Wars litigation.</p>
<p>
  [26] Farley J., the bankruptcy judge, ruled that it was not material that the 
  costs were paid, since the debts were owed as of the date of the petition. He 
  granted a receiving order against Mr. Platt on February 7, 2000 on the basis 
  that the petitioning creditors were owed in excess of $1,000. He found that 
  the judgments and orders entered against Mr. Platt more than six months before 
  the issuance of the petition were sufficient evidence of an act of bankruptcy 
  within six months of the filing date of the petition, without a formal demand. 
  </p>
<p>
  [27] The bankruptcy judge also found that Mr. Platt generally had failed to 
  meet his obligations as they fell due: </p>
<p class="indent"> Quite clearly, there is evidence of multiple debts owing by 
  Mr. Platt which he has not paid over extensive periods of time. Firstly there 
  is the numbered company debt. As discussed, that should have been paid at the 
  latest by October 15, 1998, some sixteen months ago. Then there is Ms. Malmstrom's 
  judgment which should have been paid ten years ago&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">Then there is the debt owing to Eric Kraushaar of $2,196.56, 
  which falls in the same category as the numbered company debt with respect to 
  the cost orders&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Platt has also acknowledged owing the Municipality of Timmins 
  some $7,000 of tax arrears on the residence and that debt extends back for several 
  years.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> Then there is the debt that he owed Dr. Ersen Cogulu&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">Then we have the acknowledgment by Mr. Platt that he ignored 
  a 1979 judgment which Barbara Hughes had obtained.</p>
<p>
  [28] The bankruptcy judge was not told about the assignment of the Cochrane 
  mortgage on Mr. Platt's home from Murrayfield to Mr. Marler. </p>
<p>
  [29] Mr. Platt's appeal of the receiving order was heard by the Court of Appeal 
  on March 12, 2001. Although one of the grounds of appeal was that the petition 
  was filed for an improper purpose, this ground was not pursued at the hearing 
  of the appeal. On March 23, 2001, the court dismissed Mr. Platt's appeal.</p>
<p>
  [30] On April 30, 2001, Mr. Platt brought a motion seeking an order annulling 
  the receiving order pursuant to s. 187(9) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, 
  R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the BIA), on the grounds that Mr. Marler had acted improperly. 
  On July 2, 2001, the motion was adjourned and the bankruptcy judge ordered a 
  viva voce hearing limited to two issues: meetings between Mr. Hanemaayer and 
  Mr. Boudreau concerning the alleged involvement of Mr. Hanemaayer in the Platt 
  bankruptcy litigation; and the legal accounts rendered by Mr. Marler to Murrayfield 
  and Ms. Malmstrom, as well as the payment of and responsibility for those accounts.</p>
<p>
  [31] The bankruptcy judge, after hearing evidence from Mr. Hanemaayer, Mr. Boudreau, 
  Mr. Marler, Mr. Wiebe, and Ms. Malmstrom, dismissed the annulment motion on 
  November 28, 2001. In his endorsement, he stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Hanemaayer interests were separately represented at the petition. Hanemaayer 
  was wary of everybody; he wanted his lawyer (Duncan) involved. Marler appears 
  to have stumbled across 839 [39 Ltd.] indirectly through his property searches. 
  That, once the petitioners joined forces, it is not surprising that they would 
  co-operate with each other - including advising as to other creditors - e.g. 
  Malmstrom. Joining forces is not the same thing as acting jointly and it certainly 
  does not mean that motives are the same or that there is a conspiracy (to bankrupt 
  Platt so as to eliminate a litigation adversary). Even if it were shown that 
  839 had an improper motive, there is still the petition of Malmstrom which would 
  not be affected.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> Improper purpose was raised as a suspicion before me - that 
  Hanemaayer was orchestrating the petition to eliminate Platt as a litigant adversary 
  in the China Wars. No evidence relevant to that was adduced. Improper purpose 
  was raised in the Notice of Appeal and in the factum for the Court of Appeal 
  according to counsel before me. I was however advised that the issue was not 
  raised at the Court of Appeal. Counsel for Platt in the annulment hearing (Mr. 
  Rollo) confirmed that he could not point out any new evidence which had been 
  "discovered" in between the hearing of the appeal on March 12, 2001 and the 
  notice of motion for annulment [on] April 30, 2001.</p>
<p class="indent">In the end result I do not find that Platt has met the onus 
  involved in introducing fresh evidence. Indeed the material which he has adduced 
  even now is not material or persuasive on the issue of Platt being declared 
  bankrupt.</p>
<p>
  [32] On December 27, 2001, the bankruptcy judge awarded costs on a substantial 
  indemnity basis to Mr. Marler against Mr. Platt, to survive the bankruptcy, 
  and concluded that Mr. Boudreau, as a non-party, should not be liable for costs. 
  </p>
<p>
  [33] Mr. Platt again appealed the bankruptcy judge's order. This is that appeal. 
  Mr. Platt is appealing from the related orders of the bankruptcy judge, dated 
  July 2, 2001, November 28, 2001, and December 27, 2001. He also seeks to set 
  aside the receiving order made by Farley J. on February 7, 2000 pursuant to 
  s. 181(1) of the BIA.</p>
<p>
  [34] At the date originally scheduled for the hearing of this appeal, Mr. Platt 
  brought a motion before this panel to adduce fresh evidence. The motion was 
  successful, and the hearing was adjourned to provide the respondents with an 
  opportunity to prepare responding material for a new hearing before the same 
  panel. </p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [35] Mr. Platt argued that there is now sufficient evidence, adduced by way 
  of fresh evidence, to justify either setting aside the receiving order or ordering 
  a new hearing. The fresh evidence, he submits, supports his argument that the 
  Platt bankruptcy litigation was initiated by Mr. Hanemaayer, 39 Ltd., and Mr. 
  Kraushaar for an improper purpose: to obtain the Kaolin Claims by eliminating 
  Mr. Platt as an adversary in the China Wars litigation; to shield them from 
  a tax reassessment of their claim for $18 million in flow-through tax benefits; 
  and to obtain a grant of more than $3 million from Natural Resources Canada. 
  </p>
<p>
  [36] Mr. Platt relies on a reporting letter, dated February 9, 2000, from Irwin 
  Duncan, former counsel for 39 Ltd., to Earl Orth, a management consultant to 
  39 Ltd. who swore the bankruptcy petition for 39 Ltd. The letter was written 
  two days after the receiving order was made. In it, Mr. Duncan confirmed that 
  the bankruptcy could be used to resolve the outstanding litigation: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the final result Platt was adjudged bankrupt and the firm of Scott, Pichelli 
  &amp; Graci Limited was appointed as trustee in Bankruptcy. You should receive 
  Notice of the First Meeting of Creditors and a Statement of Affairs shortly. 
  As we discussed with you we recommend that you involve yourself directly in 
  the bankruptcy proceedings to ensure that Platt complies with the requirements 
  of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. Mr. Platt's bankruptcy will also give 
  you an opportunity to hopefully finally deal with the outstanding litigation 
  that has been going on for many years. This matter will have to be carefully 
  managed to ensure that Platt's counterclaim is dismissed and that the relief 
  sought by 798839 Ontario Limited and Jacobus Hanemaayer in the Statement of 
  Claim is realized [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [37] Mr. Platt also relies on fresh evidence to support his argument that Murrayfield 
  initiated the bankruptcy proceedings for an improper purpose. Mr. Platt relies 
  on an affidavit of verification sworn by Mr. Wiebe on behalf of Murrayfield 
  in which it is claimed, incorrectly, that Mr. Platt owed Murrayfield a debt 
  on the mortgage. Mr. Platt's assertion that this claim was false is confirmed 
  by the minutes of a meeting of the inspectors, dated July 4, 2002, a document 
  that was not before the bankruptcy judge. In the minutes, the trustee states 
  that the Cochrane mortgage was "duly paid off by Mr. Platt" and that, 
  accordingly, the inspector authorized the trustee to proceed to set aside the 
  mortgage to Murrayfield. </p>
<p>
  [38] The fresh evidence also clearly implicates Mr. Marler. </p>
<p>
  [39] Mr. Wiebe swore Murrayfield's false affidavit at Mr. Marler's law office. 
  Neither Murrayfield nor Mr. Wiebe responded to the 1999 motion before Boissoneault 
  J. to discharge the mortgage and, thereby, admitted that there was no amount 
  due under the mortgage. Nor did Mr. Marler reveal to the bankruptcy judge that 
  the mortgage on Mr. Platt's home had been assigned to him.</p>
<p>
  [40] Moreover, there are significant discrepancies between Mr. Marler's testimony 
  and the fresh documentary evidence. Nadeau J.'s reasons in the Boudreau mortgage 
  action against Mr. Marler, Mr. Wiebe, and Murrayfield, released on March 18, 
  2002, indicate that the assignment of the mortgage from Murrayfield to Mr. Marler 
  was a fraudulent conveyance and an unlawful preference. Nadeau J. also held 
  that Mr. Marler wilfully misled the court and lacked credibility. Moreover, 
  he held that Mr. Marler double and triple billed his clients Murrayfield and 
  Ms. Malmstrom. </p>
<p>
  [41] In addition, Mr. Marler testified that he had never met or spoken with 
  Mr. Hanemaayer until the summer of 2001, and that Mr. Hanemaayer's company, 
  39 Ltd., had been separately represented throughout the Platt bankruptcy proceedings 
  by its own counsel. To confirm this testimony, at the bankruptcy hearing on 
  November 26, 2001, Mr. Marler filed a fax that he had sent to Ms. Malmstrom 
  on January 27, 2001, nearly a year after the receiving order was issued, in 
  which he stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I sincerely hope that Mr. Hanemaayer does not make a deal with either Mr. Platt 
  or Mr. Boudreau. However, I have no control over Mr. Hanemaayer. Indeed, I have 
  never met or even spoken to him. I have not acted for 798839 Ontario Ltd. in 
  this or any matter. However, I am doing work for Great Lakes Nickel Ltd., which 
  is indirectly controlled by Mr. Hanemaayer [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [42] Mr. Marler's assertion that he had no relationship with Mr. Hanemaayer 
  or 39 Ltd. is contradicted by two letters and an affidavit in the fresh evidence. 
  The first letter is from Mr. Marler to Mr. Duncan, former counsel to 39 Ltd., 
  dated October 31, 2000, about one year before Mr. Marler's 2001 testimony and 
  three months before his fax to Ms. Malmstrom, and not previously available. 
  This letter states in part: "I am somewhat embarrassed by my appointment 
  to represent the interests of 798839 Ontario Ltd. in the Platt bankruptcy." 
  There is also a responding letter from Mr. Duncan to Mr. Marler, dated November 
  1, 2000, acknowledging Mr. Marler's appointment and asking for the delivery 
  of a notice of change of solicitors. </p>
<p>
  [43] The fresh evidence also includes confirmation of Mr. Marler's relationship 
  with Mr. Hanemaayer's company, in the form of an affidavit from Mr. Orth sworn 
  August 3, 2002, in which Mr. Orth states: "[I]n the meantime, Platt appealed 
  the issuance of the receiving order and 39 Limited retained Jonathan Marler&#133;for 
  the purpose of orchestrating a unified response to Platt's appeal." </p>
<p>
  [44] The fresh evidence also demonstrates that Mr. Marler represented Mr. Cogulu, 
  one of the original petitioning creditors. Mr. Marler had denied this before 
  the bankruptcy judge, yet in his January 21, 2002 testimony before Nadeau J. 
  in the Boudreau mortgage action, Mr. Marler said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Initially there were three petitioning creditors, Mr. Wiebe, excuse me, Murrayfield 
  Corp. claiming the money due under its mortgage, a Doctor Ersen Cogulu who was 
  one of the judgment creditors to whom I referred earlier in my evidence who 
  had registered a judgment against Mr. Platt and a third petitioning creditor 
  who I did not represent, 798839 Ontario Ltd. So at the outset of the bankruptcy 
  proceeding, I represented Murrayfield Corp. and Doctor Ersen Cogulu [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [45] Also relevant is the matter of the costs that were paid by certified cheque 
  by JBK's solicitor on February 4, 2000, prior to the bankruptcy hearing. In 
  combination with the other fresh evidence, the refusal to accept payment at 
  Mr. Marler's direction is suspect. The refusal allowed Mr. Hanemaayer and Mr. 
  Kraushaar to participate actively in Mr. Platt's bankruptcy. </p>
<p>
  [46] The bankruptcy judge concluded that the costs payment by JBK's lawyer did 
  not disqualify the respondents as creditors because these costs were debts owed 
  as of the date of the petition. The bankruptcy judge, however, did not have 
  the benefit of several relevant letters not previously available. The first 
  letter is dated February 29, 2000, three weeks after the receiving order was 
  made. It is from another of 39 Ltd.'s lawyers, Burton Tait, to Mr. Duncan, to 
  which was attached a certified cheque for $9,895.44 payable to 39 Ltd. and Mr. 
  Hanemaayer. In this letter, Mr. Tait wrote that it had not yet been demonstrated 
  that the money had originated with Mr. Platt. </p>
<p>
  [47] The second letter, dated November 1, 2000, is from Mr. Duncan to Mr. Marler. 
  In it, Mr. Duncan expressed his concern that the funds did not belong to Mr. 
  Platt and should not, therefore, be forwarded to the trustee to form part of 
  Mr. Platt's bankrupt estate. </p>
<p>
  [48] On April 11, 2001, Mr. Marler wrote to Mr. Tait requesting that he send 
  a letter to Mr. Duncan giving him authority to release the cheques to 39 Ltd. 
  and Mr. Hanemaayer, since Mr. Duncan was still refusing to do so. On April 17, 
  2001, Mr. Duncan's firm sent the cheque to Mr. Hanemaayer on his own behalf 
  and on behalf of 39 Ltd. On Mr. Marler's advice, the cheque was endorsed in 
  favour of the trustee on April 19, 2001 by Mr. Orth on behalf of 39 Ltd. and 
  Mr. Hanemaayer.</p>
<p>
  [49] Thereafter, in a letter dated May 1, 2001, Mr. Kraushaar's counsel, Nancy 
  Spies, told Mr. Marler that pursuant to his earlier request, she was enclosing 
  a cheque for $2,196.56 for him to give to the trustee.</p>
<p>
  [50] The trustee, who, as previously indicated, had been nominated by Mr. Marler, 
  was informed by Mr. Platt that the costs awards had been paid by a third party. 
  Had payment of these costs been accepted, 39 Ltd., Mr. Hanemaayer, and Mr. Kraushaar 
  would not have been able to participate in the administration of Mr. Platt's 
  estate. </p>
<p>
  [51] The July 4, 2002 minutes of the inspectors' meeting show that the trustee 
  attempted to enlist free legal services from counsel to 39 Ltd., Mr. Hanemaayer, 
  and Mr. Kraushaar in order to conclude the sale of Mr. Platt's interests in 
  the China Wars litigation. The minutes indicate that counsel for Mr. Kraushaar 
  and Mr. Hanemaayer agreed to cross-examine Mr. Platt and Mr. Boudreau in the 
  bankruptcy proceedings, at no cost, on the issue of the ownership of the shares 
  of JBK. </p>
<p>
  [52] The impropriety of Mr. Marler's role in orchestrating the bankruptcy proceedings 
  is reinforced by his astonishing conduct in relation to his cost assessments, 
  as mentioned earlier. Nadeau J. stated in his reasons in Mr. Boudreau's action 
  that "the evidence of double and triple billing by Mr. Marler and his obtaining 
  the Consent of Wiebe and Murrayfield to the Assessment of Bills of Costs demonstrate 
  his complicity." </p>
<p>
  [53] On the consent of Mr. Wiebe and Murrayfield, Mr. Marler had Murrayfield's 
  costs in the bankruptcy proceedings assessed and allowed in the amount of $70,270 
  by an assessment officer of the Superior Court of Justice in Milton on January 
  23, 2001. Ms. Malmstrom's accounts were assessed and allowed by the Registrar 
  in Bankruptcy on July 12, 2000 in the amount of $51,700. The total of both sets 
  of costs was $121,970. At the time, Mr. Platt owed Ms. Malmstrom $1,500. Murrayfield 
  was owed nothing and was $500,000 in debt.</p>
<p>
  [54] There is also Ms. Malmstrom's bill of costs for the appeal of the receiving 
  order, approved by the Registrar in Bankruptcy in the total amount of $31,027. 
  </p>
<p>
  [55] The bankruptcy proceedings were brought by petitioning creditors who had 
  a total claim of only $11,500 and who, by the time the hearing started, had 
  been offered certified cheques to cover their claims. Instead of accepting payment, 
  aided by Mr. Marler, they engineered their participation in Mr. Platt's bankruptcy. 
  The fresh evidence clearly discloses that the bankruptcy proceedings were in 
  fact used as a tactic by 39 Ltd. and its owners to eliminate an adversary from 
  the China Wars litigation. Moreover, the fresh evidence supports Mr. Platt's 
  claim that there was no money owing on the Cochrane mortgage, which meant that 
  Mr. Platt's home was mortgage free and worth more than $100,000. This amount 
  was more than sufficient to discharge his debts.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [56] The fresh evidence indicates that Mr. Platt was solvent at the time that 
  the bankruptcy proceedings were initiated, that there were no amounts owing 
  on the Cochrane mortgage on his home, and that the bankruptcy was initiated 
  for an improper purpose by 39 Ltd., Mr. Kraushaar, and Mr. Hanemaayer and orchestrated 
  by Mr. Marler.</p>
<p>
  [57] Given the compelling evidence of impropriety and improper purpose revealed 
  by the fresh evidence, I would set aside all the bankruptcy orders as requested, 
  including the receiving order. Mr. Platt is entitled to his costs on a partial 
  indemnity basis, fixed in the total amount of $40,000.</p>
