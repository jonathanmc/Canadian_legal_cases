<p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice Robert E. Zelinski of the 
  Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on June 27, 1998, and from the 
  sentences imposed by Justice Zelinski on June 27, 1998.</p>
<p>
  ROSENBERG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellants Robert Pollock and David Morrisson appeal from their convictions 
  and sentences for first-degree murder and attempted murder following a trial 
  before Zelinski J. and a jury. The following are my reasons for allowing Pollock's 
  appeal from conviction and ordering a new trial, and for dismissing Morrisson's 
  appeal. A portion of the sentence imposed on Morrisson was illegal, and I would 
  allow his appeal from sentence and correct that error.</p>
<p>
  [2] Pollock and Morrisson were tried jointly. The Crown's case against both 
  of them was formidable. What leads to the different results in the two appeals 
  is that, in my view, Pollock was deprived of a fair trial because of the conduct 
  of Morrisson's defence. That defence involved an unrelenting attack on Pollock's 
  character. Further, Morrisson's counsel, Mr. Cornale, frequently ignored the 
  trial judge's rulings: he introduced or attempted to introduce inadmissible 
  and highly prejudicial evidence despite the many timely objections by counsel 
  for Pollock, Mr. Kerbel. </p>
<p>
  [3] The evidence was introduced by Morrisson's counsel on the theory that it 
  was necessary to ensure that Morrisson received a fair trial. Morrisson had 
  given a false statement to the police the day after the offences. The trial 
  judge permitted defence counsel for Morrisson to question Crown witnesses about 
  Pollock's disposition for violence to support the Morrisson defence theory that 
  Morrisson lied to the police because of his fear of Pollock. At the time this 
  evidence was introduced, Morrisson's fear of Pollock was not a live issue in 
  the case. There was no evidence that Morrisson was afraid of Pollock or that 
  he lied to the police because of any fear of Pollock. In addition to the evidence 
  that was permitted by the trial judge's rulings, Morrisson's counsel constantly 
  asked questions that called for inadmissible hearsay or opinion answers, or 
  answers that went beyond the trial judge's rulings. In my view, the trial was 
  so distorted by this evidence and this conduct that Pollock did not receive 
  a fair trial.</p>
<p>
  [4] Morrisson appeals his conviction, principally on the basis of some of the 
  cross-examination conducted by Pollock's counsel. In my view, the cross-examination 
  was proper and the evidence elicited was admissible. </p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [5] In view of the grounds of appeal raised by both appellants, I find it necessary 
  to provide a relatively lengthy recitation of the facts. I will also include 
  in this summary a review of the trial chronology, which is important in order 
  to understand how the inadmissible and prejudicial evidence came before the 
  jury.</p>
<p>
  1. The shootings</p>
<p>
  [6] The deceased Stewart Weston was a dealer in drugs. Blair Smith, the victim 
  of the attempted murder, was a friend of Weston's. The two of them would often 
  go for walks together. On November 25, 1993, Weston came over to Smith's house 
  and the two left for their walk a little after 9:00 p.m. Before leaving from 
  Smith's house, Weston told one of Smith's roommates that if "Dave" 
  came, he should wait for him at the house or meet him during the walk. Smith 
  had met the appellant Morrisson on several occasions and knew him as "Dave". 
  Weston and Smith had a regular route that they followed.</p>
<p>
  [7] About halfway through the walk, Smith and Weston came upon a truck parked 
  at the side of the road. As they came within fifteen yards of the truck, the 
  driver's door opened and someone left the vehicle. Then, another person jumped 
  out from behind a tree and fired two shots. These first shots hit Weston. The 
  shooter then shot Smith at almost point blank range, hitting him in the area 
  of his left shoulder blade. Smith fell down. The shot had paralysed Smith from 
  the armpits down. Smith was unable to identify either the shooter or the driver.</p>
<p>
  [8] While he was lying on the ground, Smith heard the footsteps of the shooter 
  and the driver walking towards the area where he thought Weston to be. Smith 
  heard two more gunshots and then kicking sounds that lasted for about 30 seconds. 
  The two persons returned to the truck and drove off.</p>
<p>
  [9] People in the area heard the gunshots, and shortly after 10:00 p.m. the 
  police were in attendance. A number of people had also earlier seen the truck 
  used by the perpetrators parked in the area of the shootings. A description 
  of the truck was broadcast shortly after the killings. One witness testified 
  that the truck did not have licence plates. </p>
<p>
  [10] According to the pathologist, Weston had died from a combination of gunshots 
  and blunt force injuries to the head. The blunt force injuries were likely caused 
  by a combination of "pistol whipping" and kicks. The pathologist suggested 
  that two different types of footwear, one a hard shoe and the other a soft shoe, 
  could have caused the injuries. A bullet recovered from Smith's clothing appeared 
  to have been fired from a .38 or .357 calibre handgun, with Smith and Wesson 
  specifications.</p>
<p>
  2. Morrisson's original statement to the police</p>
<p>
  [11] At about 5:00 p.m. on the day following the shootings, the police received 
  a call from a lawyer, Allan Mintz, who stated that his client had witnessed 
  a shooting and wanted to speak to the police. The police arranged to meet with 
  the lawyer and his client at a doughnut shop. The police arrived at the doughnut 
  shop at about 6:30 p.m., and Morrisson arrived at the shop about 6:50 p.m. He 
  was driving his white Bronco truck. He said that he was scared and wanted to 
  tell the whole story. Mr. Mintz did not arrive. After waiting for some time, 
  Morrisson agreed to accompany the officers to the police station. At about 9:55 
  p.m. Mr. Mintz called the station and briefly spoke to Morrisson. Morrisson 
  then spoke to the police.</p>
<p>
  [12] Morrisson described Weston and Smith as his friends. He said that Weston 
  was a major drug dealer and that he, Morrisson, also sometimes sold drugs to 
  finance his own habit. He said that Weston had called Morrisson and asked to 
  meet Morrisson during his, Weston's, walk, as they had done many times before. 
  This meeting was so that Morrisson could repay a debt to Weston. He was to bring 
  $410. Morrisson drove to Smith's house, but by that time Weston and Smith had 
  left on the walk, so Morrisson drove to a spot on the route. As Weston and Smith 
  approached, Morrisson saw a large man step out of the bush and fire five or 
  six shots. He could not identify the shooter. Smith fell down and the man chased 
  Weston. Morrisson said that he only heard shots and no beating or kicking noises. 
  Morrisson said he had never been so scared. Morrisson offered the opinion that 
  there were many people who would have wanted to kill Weston because of his cocaine 
  trafficking. Morrisson expressed no fear of Pollock.</p>
<p>
  3. Terry McLean</p>
<p>
  [13] Terry McLean was a person whose name surfaced in the course of the investigation. 
  The police believed that he was a drug dealer, and had been involved in several 
  assaults and shootings in the Hamilton area. The police interviewed McLean about 
  the shootings and he was unable to account for his whereabouts on November 24 
  and 25. By the time of the trial, McLean had disappeared.</p>
<p>
  4. Surveillance of Morrisson and Pollock</p>
<p>
  [14] The police seized the Bronco and the clothing Morrisson said he had been 
  wearing the night before. Morrisson was not arrested but the police kept him 
  under surveillance over the following days. On November 27th, after taking a 
  circuitous route, Morrisson drove to Pollock's residence. About two hours later, 
  Morrisson went to a mall and parked next to a car normally driven by Pollock 
  or his girlfriend. Morrisson spoke to the male driver of the vehicle for about 
  eight minutes. The following day, Morrisson met Pollock at another plaza. The 
  two spoke for a few minutes. On November 29th, Morrisson drove to Pollock's 
  home and remained there for about seven minutes.</p>
<p>
  [15] Morrisson's Bronco was examined by experts from the Centre for Forensic 
  Sciences. They found a small bloodstain on the passenger side of the vehicle 
  that was matched to Weston's blood through DNA analysis.</p>
<p>
  [16] Over the next few months, the police maintained intermittent surveillance 
  of Pollock and Morrisson. On several occasions, Pollock was seen to meet with 
  a friend, B, who eventually became a witness at the trial. The trial judge made 
  an order that the identities of B and another witness, A, not be published. 
  The police also observed some further contact between Pollock and Morrisson. 
  </p>
<p>
  [17] Police surveillance also showed that in late January 1994, A, Pollock and 
  others were involved in a conspiracy to rob a jewellery store. Evidence concerning 
  this conspiracy forms part of Pollock's principal ground of appeal and I will 
  discuss it in further detail below.</p>
<p>
  5. Teresa Jones's initial statements</p>
<p>
  [18] Teresa Jones was Pollock's girlfriend, and was living with him at the time 
  of the killing. In January 1994, the police began applying pressure to Jones 
  to tell the police about Pollock's involvement in the killing. Initially, Jones 
  refused to provide much information other than to say that she thought she may 
  have been at home with Pollock watching movies on the night of the killing. 
  She also said that she did not know Morrisson, Weston or Smith. In one meeting, 
  an officer asked Jones if she had ever had sex with Weston. She denied it.</p>
<p>
  6. The "Arizona ploy"</p>
<p>
  [19] On March 3, 1994, the police executed a plan that became known as the "Arizona 
  ploy". The idea was for undercover police officers to pose as drug dealers 
  from Arizona. Morrisson panicked when he heard that these men had come to his 
  residence, and he went to the police station. He told the police that he was 
  concerned that these men thought he was involved in Weston's death. He also 
  mentioned that he had been discussing some aspects of the murder case with his 
  "buddy", Pollock. While Morrisson expressed fear for himself and his 
  family arising out of the appearance of the people from Arizona, he did not 
  express any fear of Pollock. The officer asked Morrisson directly if Pollock 
  had been at the scene of the killing and Morrisson said that he did not see 
  him. The officer suggested that Pollock was the shooter, but Morrisson said 
  that it was not Pollock, that the shooter was taller than Pollock.</p>
<p>
  7. The impugned evidence</p>
<p>(a) Weston's ring, the robbery conspiracy and the threat</p>
<p>
  [20] In February 1994, Weston's daughter began inquiring about the return of 
  Weston's property. In particular, she asked about a ring her father usually 
  wore, which had not been returned to her after his death. The issue was not 
  followed up until August 1994 when Ms. Weston drew a picture of the ring for 
  one of the police officers. Eventually, the police learned of the involvement 
  of A and other persons in disposing of a ring.</p>
<p>
  [21] A testified at trial that shortly before Christmas 1993, he had received 
  a call from Craig Foster, a friend of A's brother. Foster asked A to contact 
  a jeweller, Hans Rapedius, whom he knew handled stolen jewellery. A and Foster 
  then met up with Pollock. Pollock handed over a plastic bag that contained a 
  man's gold ring with a big single solitaire diamond and rows of about six small 
  diamonds along each side. According to A, Pollock explained that "the body 
  this ring came off is no longer breathing". A and Foster then drove to 
  Rapedius's home, where Rapedius gave them $2,500 in cash in exchange for the 
  ring. They returned to Foster's house and Foster called Pollock. Later, Foster 
  provided the money to Pollock less $100 that Foster gave to A. The theory of 
  the Crown was that this was Weston's ring and that Pollock acquired it after 
  killing Weston. A's description of the ring differed somewhat from the description 
  Ms. Weston gave of the ring she had seen her father wear. </p>
<p>
  [22] In April 1994, A was charged with conspiracy to rob a jewellery store. 
  He was eventually released on very strict bail conditions. In December 1995, 
  A was charged with breach of recognizance and he then asked the local police 
  to contact the Halton police regarding Weston's murder. A gave statements to 
  the police about the ring and entered the witness-protection programme. A's 
  conspiracy charge was eventually withdrawn. A had a lengthy criminal record 
  and was still carrying on with illegal activities while negotiating with the 
  police.</p>
<p>
  [23] In addition to his testimony at trial regarding the sale of the ring, the 
  Crown sought to introduce evidence from A concerning a threat that Pollock made 
  to A in the course of the robbery conspiracy. The Crown anticipated that A would 
  testify to the effect that Pollock said "I'll kill you too" to A, 
  if A or other conspirators were to tell anyone about the robbery conspiracy.</p>
<p>
  [24] The Crown alleged that these words contained an admission to the earlier 
  Weston killing, and sought to introduce this evidence. The Crown recognized 
  that evidence of the robbery conspiracy was prejudicial and therefore only sought 
  to lead the statement. Counsel for Pollock opposed admission. Morrisson's counsel 
  took no part in the argument. When asked if he had any submissions, he said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  No, as you say, not at this point in time, thank you. It's my friends taking 
  issue as you are aware at this time. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [25] The trial judge ruled on the Crown's application. He held that the evidence 
  was inadmissible. He viewed the so-called admission as being of "marginal 
  probative value" and as being extremely prejudicial. He said this: </p>
<p class="indent"> [The evidence of the statement] invites inferences of the propensity 
  of Mr. Pollock to murder and / or violence. Hearing it may also mislead or confuse 
  the jury. It will undoubtedly necessitate very lengthy cross-examination which 
  will likely refer to the participation of [A] and Mr. Pollock in an intended 
  robbery which is itself, unrelated to the murder.</p>
<p class="indent">Instructions that I give to the jury referable to such evidence 
  might, in my view, also confuse the jury. [Emphasis added.] </p>
<p>I agree with the trial judge's ruling and the reasons he gave. The evidence 
  was of marginal probative value. It would be nothing more than speculation to 
  connect the alleged threat to the killing and the evidence was highly prejudicial. 
  </p>
<p>
  [26] The trial proceeded accordingly. The trial judge made one further ruling 
  in the course of A's evidence-in-chief. He permitted Crown counsel to lead evidence 
  from A as to what led him to connect the ring to the murder, namely a newspaper 
  story. Counsel for Pollock objected because he feared this might lead to discussion 
  of Pollock's involvement in the robbery conspiracy. There was some further evidence-in-chief 
  from A about subsequent charges, including conspiracy to commit robbery (there 
  was no mention of Pollock), his deal with the police and Crown, and his entry 
  into the witness-relocation programme. This evidence was relevant to A's credibility, 
  it being the theory of the defence, in part, that A, who had a lengthy criminal 
  record, was lying in exchange for favours from the authorities. </p>
<p>
  [27] Counsel for Morrisson then cross-examined A. He established that A had 
  no dealings with Morrisson and did not even know him. He asked some questions 
  about the ring transaction and whether A had some subsequent dealings with Pollock 
  and Foster. Then, without obtaining a ruling from the trial judge, he asked 
  A the following question: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. And when you had these further dealings and further meetings 
  both with Mr. Foster and Mr. Pollock, you had met with Mr. Pollock and at one 
  stage he said "And I'll kill you too"?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Correct?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes, he did.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. What did he say to you then?</p>
<p>
  [28] Counsel for Pollock then objected and the jury was excused. The trial judge 
  rightly asked Morrisson's counsel why he did not clear the issue with the Court 
  before asking the question. In hindsight, perhaps the fact that Morrisson's 
  counsel had said he had no submissions "at this time" during the discussion 
  of the Crown's possible examination of A on the same issue should have alerted 
  the trial judge and other counsel to what was going to happen. Be that as it 
  may, counsel for Morrisson gave no real indication that he intended to lead 
  this same evidence from A. He should have given such an indication. It was unfair 
  to the trial judge, Crown counsel and counsel for Pollock. Had counsel and the 
  trial judge known that Morrisson's counsel intended to lead this evidence, they 
  could have addressed the whole issue at that time. In light of what occurred, 
  it is apparent that Morrisson's counsel decided on a tactic of surprising the 
  trial participants by leading evidence that he knew was presumptively inadmissible.</p>
<p>
  [29] When asked why he did not clear the issue with the trial judge before asking 
  the question, counsel for Morrisson replied that this was a "crucial and 
  relevant area" for the defence and the earlier ruling only applied to the 
  Crown. He argued that the evidence was admissible to show Pollock's propensity 
  for violence and would therefore support Morrisson's position that he too was 
  afraid of Pollock and that is why he did not tell the police the whole "truth" 
  in his earlier statement. Morrisson's counsel summarized the theory for admitting 
  the evidence as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Mr. Morrisson like this witness, like the other witness in the witness protection 
  program, was extremely fearful and under the threat and fear of his life as 
  well. And had grave concerns in giving the statement in the way and nature that 
  he gave it. And it's extremely relevant, crucial and critical that this evidence, 
  which is fundamental, critical to the defence in this case, be illustrated through 
  this witness.</p>
<p>[30] Pollock's counsel submitted that the evidence was not probative. He also 
  made the point that at this stage there was no evidence from Morrisson that 
  he was afraid of Pollock. Further, this threat was made after the fact to other 
  people and therefore could not have influenced Morrisson in any way.</p>
<p>
  [31] In the course of his submissions, counsel for Pollock referred to Morrisson's 
  counsel's tactic as a "sneak attack" and an "ambush". The 
  trial judge admonished counsel for those comments, stating his belief that Mr. 
  Cornale had been "a very responsible counsel who has addressed issues head 
  on". In hindsight, this comment may have been misinterpreted by Mr. Cornale 
  as a green light for the continuing use of the same kind of tactics that he 
  employed on this occasion, as I will describe below.</p>
<p>
  [32] Following extensive argument, the trial judge ruled that the question was 
  proper. He did so on the basis that the evidence was necessary for Morrisson 
  to make full answer and defence. This became a crucial ruling and I therefore 
  reproduce most of it below. </p>
<p class="indent"> The theory of the defence is that those statements were made 
  out of fear of Mr. Morrisson in relation to his co-accused, Mr. Pollock, all 
  of which can be developed as being plausible, having regard to the disposition 
  issues referred to that are presently being developed, if permitted, through 
  [A]. </p>
<p class="indent">Succinctly, Mr. Cornale indicates that the question must necessarily 
  be answered in response to full answer and defence entitlements of his client. 
  That, in my view, is a significantly different issue than the one that I addressed 
  in my earlier ruling when I did not permit the Crown to develop that line of 
  questioning.</p>
<p class="indent">Counsel have referred a number of cases to me including Regina 
  v. Kendall and McKay, 35 C.C.C. (3d) at 105; Regina v. Tom 1997 O.J. Number 
  2807 and those other cases which Ms. Jago [Crown counsel] indicated she had 
  passed on to counsel, and of which I take note at this time.</p>
<p class="indent">As stated in Regina v. Arcangioli, one of those cases, at page 
  297: </p>
<p class="indent">"The courts are reluctant to exclude evidence offered by an 
  accused in his defence."</p>
<p class="indent">This is prefaced by the statement: </p>
<p class="indent"> "The proposition is unquestioned that evidence which is logically 
  probative may be excluded where its probative value is slight but its prejudicial 
  effect upon the fair trial of the accused is great."</p>
<p class="indent">That, in essence, is the position presented on behalf of Mr. 
  Pollock against which I must weigh, using some test of proportionality, the 
  full answer and defence rights of Mr. Morrisson. I take it as a given, that 
  the co-accused, unlike the Crown whose hands are tied in the area of the issues 
  of character, do not have their hands similarly tied.</p>
<p class="indent">The question and the answer that were given will not be struck 
  on the grounds that the question asked was admissible. It is derived in matters 
  relevant to full answer and defence issues. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [33] After ruling that evidence of the threat was admissible, the trial judge 
  considered whether evidence of the robbery conspiracy itself was admissible. 
  In the course of submissions opposing admission of this evidence, counsel for 
  Pollock pointed out that at this stage there was no evidence that Morrisson 
  made his statement to the police out of fear of Pollock. The trial judge ruled 
  that the evidence of the robbery conspiracy was not admissible, holding in part 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am of the view that there is little, if any, relevance to the circumstances 
  of Mr. Morrisson's complete defence that a robbery was being planned by Mr. 
  Pollock and others weeks after the murder, and that the admission of his alleged 
  threat on that day necessitates all of the evidence of disposition which surrounds 
  that alleged threat. This is despite Mr. Cornale's suggestion that there is 
  a similarity in Mr. Pollock's treatment of, and disposition, towards his joint 
  ventures in crime.</p>
<p>
  [34] As a result of the trial judge's ruling concerning the threat, Pollock 
  applied for severance. The application was dismissed.</p>
<p>
  (b) Evidence of Pollock's drug dealing</p>
<p>
  [35] In continuing to cross-examine A, counsel for Morrisson asked A to confirm 
  that A had learned that Pollock owed money to Foster. Counsel for Pollock objected. 
  After the jury was excused, he pointed out that this debt arose out of a drug 
  transaction, a topic upon which he could not cross-examine without making the 
  situation for his client "worse". The trial judge ruled that this 
  evidence was admissible as it was relevant to "issues of full answer and 
  defence". Before the cross-examination continued, the trial judge gave 
  the jury an instruction as to the use of this evidence: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Members of the jury, again when [A] comes back it's proposed by Mr. Cornale 
  that he is going to engage in some questions which clearly identify themselves 
  with the issues of the disposition of Mr. Pollock. As I explained to you previously, 
  such questions are not evidence Mr. Pollock committed the crimes set out in 
  the indictment. Simply on the basis that he is a type of person who would commit 
  crimes, such evidence is evidence which cannot be used to infer from the fact 
  of that evidence that it is positive evidence of the evidence of the guilt of 
  Mr. Pollock in relation to these crimes. You cannot conclude that something 
  by virtue of the evidence you hear that he is a bad person who from that evidence, 
  has a propensity, and for that reason must be the person who has committed the 
  crime set out in the indictment or either of them.</p>
<p>
  (c) A and the witness-protection programme</p>
<p>
  [36] Over objection from counsel for Pollock, the trial judge ruled that counsel 
  for Morrisson could lead evidence that A entered the witness-protection programme 
  because of his fear of Pollock. Counsel for Morrisson led evidence from A that 
  the threat from Pollock, the comment during the ring sale, and the newspaper 
  articles about the offences, all prompted A's fear of Pollock and desire to 
  enter the witness-protection programme. I point out that at this time Pollock's 
  counsel had not cross-examined A, and there was therefore no suggestion that 
  A's motives for entering the witness-protection programme were a live issue 
  in the case.</p>
<p>
  (d) Pollock's involvement in the robbery conspiracy</p>
<p>
  [37] In the course of cross-examination by counsel for Pollock, A admitted to 
  having committed a large number of offences, only some of which had resulted 
  in convictions. He also admitted to having lied to the police, when giving sworn 
  statements as well as at the preliminary inquiry. Following cross-examination, 
  the trial judge permitted counsel for Morrisson to cross-examine A further and 
  adduce evidence that Pollock was a member of the robbery conspiracy. The basis 
  for the ruling was that in cross-examining A on the conspiracy, counsel had 
  adduced the names of the other conspirators, which would leave a misleading 
  impression that Pollock was not a member of the conspiracy. </p>
<p>
  (e) The "triggerman" comment</p>
<p>
  [38] Another matter arose at this time. The Crown had disclosed to the defence 
  a statement from a police officer, Albano, who had the initial dealings with 
  A. According, to Albano, A had said Pollock was the "triggerman". 
  This remark was not contained in any of the various sworn statements A had given 
  the police and had not been mentioned by A during his testimony at the preliminary 
  inquiry. The trial judge told A that it had been indicated that A might have 
  said something about Pollock being the triggerman but that he was not to mention 
  this remark during his further testimony.</p>
<p>
  [39] During cross-examination by counsel for Morrisson, A testified that he 
  had approached the police with information about the ring because of his fear 
  of Pollock who was a member of the robbery conspiracy. Then, in the course of 
  the cross-examination of A by Pollock's counsel, counsel asked A if he had told 
  officer Albano anything else about the homicide. At that point, A said that 
  he had but could not disclose it. Crown counsel then intervened and informed 
  the jury that A had been told by the trial judge not to mention the evidence. 
  Over objection by counsel for Pollock, the trial judge ruled that A would be 
  allowed to answer the question on the basis that if the trial judge were to 
  prevent him from answering the question, it would "[look] like the defence 
  of Mr. Pollock [was] being restricted in some way, shape or form". A then 
  testified that at one of his later meetings with Albano, he told Albano that 
  his "understanding" was that Pollock had "fired the shots". 
  It is apparent that this was hearsay, and the trial judge instructed the jury 
  that the statement was not admissible for its truth.</p>
<p>
  [40] In re-examination, Crown counsel was permitted to adduce further evidence 
  of Pollock's involvement in the robbery conspiracy and to ask further questions 
  about A's statement that Pollock was the triggerman.</p>
<p>
  (f) Constable Albano and Pollock's criminal record</p>
<p>
  [41] The Crown later called officer Albano. He gave brief evidence about his 
  dealings with A. However, in cross-examination by counsel for Morrisson, Albano 
  testified that he had been requested by officers investigating the murder to 
  pull Pollock over in his car. Without first obtaining a ruling from the trial 
  judge, Morrisson's counsel asked the officer if he had checked Pollock's criminal 
  record before stopping him. The trial judge interrupted this line of questioning, 
  and the matter was not further pursued. Counsel for Morrisson also had Albano 
  confirm that A had told him that Pollock had "fired the shots".</p>
<p>
  (g) Further evidence of the robbery conspiracy</p>
<p>
  [42] Evidence about the appellant's involvement in the robbery conspiracy continued 
  to crop up during the trial. Counsel for Morrisson adduced it when cross-examining 
  one of the officers engaged in surveillance of Pollock. When counsel for Pollock 
  objected to this cross-examination, the trial judge required counsel for Morrisson 
  to leave that area since the evidence was very remote to the guilt or innocence 
  of Morrisson and could unduly prejudice, mislead or confuse the jury. Despite 
  this ruling, Morrisson's counsel returned to this area when cross-examining 
  a second surveillance officer. When counsel for Pollock objected, the trial 
  judge told counsel to move on to another area.</p>
<p>
  (h) Foster, the robbery conspiracy and Pollock's criminal record</p>
<p>
  [43] Craig Foster also testified about the ring transaction. There were some 
  discrepancies between Foster and A about the transaction, but Foster confirmed 
  Pollock's comment that it came from the "finger of a guy that was no longer 
  breathing". In cross-examination, Morrisson's counsel, again without obtaining 
  a ruling from the trial judge, adduced evidence that Foster was also involved 
  in the robbery conspiracy with Pollock. He also asked Foster if he was aware 
  of Pollock's "lengthy" criminal record, which included a conviction 
  for robbery. Counsel for Pollock objected and the trial judge directed counsel 
  to move on to another area. Morrisson's counsel nevertheless briefly returned 
  to the issue. He also adduced evidence from Foster that Foster knew B and suggested 
  that B was supplying Foster and Pollock with drugs. </p>
<p>
  [44] In cross-examination by counsel for Pollock, Foster admitted to having 
  committed hundreds or thousands of crimes. He also testified that he had not 
  actually seen the ring produced by Pollock. </p>
<p>
  (i) Morrisson's drug dealing</p>
<p>
  [45] The Crown led evidence about Morrisson's involvement in drug dealing. This 
  evidence came from Morrisson's initial statements to the police, as well as 
  from a search of Morrisson's home. Counsel for Pollock cross-examined on this 
  evidence.</p>
<p>
  (j) Teresa Jones</p>
<p>
  [46] Before Teresa Jones testified, the trial judge ruled on the admissibility 
  of some of her evidence that related to Pollock's character. The trial judge 
  held that the Crown could adduce evidence of Pollock's acts of violence toward 
  Jones to explain her some three-and-one-half-year delay in coming forward to 
  the police. The trial judge also ruled that the Crown could lead evidence of 
  Pollock's drug dealing to avoid presenting a distorted picture to the jury that 
  only Morrisson was involved in drug dealing, and as part of the narrative. </p>
<p>
  [47] The trial judge also held that since Morrisson's counsel would inevitably 
  lead this evidence from Jones in support of his defence, the Crown could lead 
  the evidence of Pollock's bad character in examination in chief. The trial judge 
  also permitted the Crown to question Jones about a photograph that Jones took 
  that showed B holding a gun, which, according to Jones, belonged to Pollock. 
  This gun was not the murder weapon but the trial judge ruled that Pollock's 
  possession of guns was relevant, in view of the expected attack on her credibility 
  by counsel for Pollock. The trial judge's ruling respecting evidence from Jones 
  and B is, in part, as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> I adopt [Crown counsel's] perception that the evidence, principally 
  elicited in the cross-examination of Crown witnesses, has made the association 
  of narcotics and violence with the death of Mr. Weston a significant, if not 
  inescapable, issue. </p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Morrisson, [and] important non-professional, non-police 
  witnesses, including Mr. Foster, have all been identified as being associated 
  with the drug sub-culture as will Ms. Jones be if permitted to present her evidence 
  in the disputed areas.</p>
<p class="indent">If permitted, they can identify Mr. Pollock's similar involvements.</p>
<p class="indent">I am persuaded at this stage that the proposed evidence of both 
  witnesses is not being offered to show "only" that the accused is the type of 
  person likely to have committed the offence in question.</p>
<p class="indent">The disputed evidence of both is relevant to the credibility 
  of each of Ms. Jones and [B]. That credibility may be both demonstrated and 
  tested by their explanations of their relationships with Mr. Pollock including 
  those matters which are in dispute as being issues of Mr. Pollock's bad character.</p>
<p class="indent">As noted, Mr. Pollock will also on the evidence sought to be 
  introduced, be identified as having had involvement in the drug sub-culture. 
  The violence associated with that sub-culture has been relevant and material 
  in this trial. The admission of the disputed evidence will rectify the prospect 
  of a picture being in the minds of the jury which is distorted. Relevance then 
  is not in issue.</p>
<p class="indent">Policy reasons to exclude that evidence in-chief ceased to apply. 
  While such evidence is, of course, prejudicial to Mr. Pollock, that prejudice 
  is diminished, in my view, by the expectation that if not the Crown, Mr. Cornale 
  will adduce the same evidence in his cross-examination.</p>
<p class="indent">The prejudice to Mr. Pollock is, as has already been stated, 
  that the evidence in question will be misused by the jury. That concern can 
  and will be addressed by a limiting statement at the appropriate stage of the 
  introduction of the evidence and in my charge.</p>
<p class="indent">In the result, it is my view that the probative value of the 
  evidence of both Ms. Jones and [B] demonstrably exceeds its prejudicial effect 
  and will be permitted. It must also be limited. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [48] Before Teresa Jones testified, the trial judge reminded the jury of his 
  previous ruling that for policy reasons the Crown could not elicit evidence 
  of Pollock's bad character but that counsel for Morrisson could do so. However, 
  there was now an exception to that rule in the case of Jones and B. The trial 
  judge then instructed the jury as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> I have, as stated, ruled that those policy reasons which would 
  otherwise prevent the Crown from asking Mrs. Jones and [B] questions about their 
  knowledge of matters which relate to the disposition and character of Mr. Pollock, 
  are not applicable to their anticipated evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">In the result, and within limits that counsel are aware of, 
  those witnesses may be asked questions by the Crown which relate to issues of 
  character, disposition, propensity and similar of Mr. Pollock that would otherwise 
  be excluded for the policy reasons I have previously referred to. </p>
<p class="indent">This ruling makes it very important that you understand that 
  I am referring to the evidence of the character/disposition of Mr. Pollock and 
  the use that you can put to that evidence. You must not use evidence of Mr. 
  Pollock's character and/or disposition improperly. You cannot use such evidence 
  in a way that might prejudice your ability to fairly and impartially determine 
  the guilt or innocence of Mr. Pollock of the charges in this trial, those being 
  first degree murder and attempted murder, on evidence which is properly applicable 
  to those charges rather than upon the type of person that he is.</p>
<p class="indent">The evidence that you will hear which relates to Mr. Pollock's 
  character/disposition cannot be used by you to convict Mr. Pollock simply because 
  that evidence tends to show that he is by virtue of character issues, likely 
  to have committed the crimes in question. </p>
<p class="indent">You cannot use such evidence to convict him of these offences 
  in order to punish him for past acts. You cannot be confused about the use you 
  can put to the character evidence which you will hear by substituting a verdict 
  for the past acts of Mr. Pollock in place of a proper verdict on the charges 
  he now faces.</p>
<p class="indent">You cannot, in other words, rely upon evidence that may tend 
  to show that Mr. Pollock is a bad person in order that Mr. Pollock, by virtue 
  of that, is determined by you to be the type of person who would commit the 
  murder and attempted murder, and to conclude, thereby, that he is, in fact, 
  guilty of one or both of the offences charged.</p>
<p class="indent">Evidence of Mr. Pollock's character and/or disposition is not 
  positive evidence of his guilt in relation to these crimes.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, I am in this limiting instruction only referring 
  to evidence of character and disposition that you may hear. Evidence, whether 
  direct evidence or circumstantial evidence which directly bears upon, or is 
  probative of the guilt or innocence of Mr. Pollock of these crimes, is not limited 
  by this warning and can be used and must be tested in the same manner as the 
  evidence of every other witness. Thus, the difference between evidence of the 
  crime which is relevant to the crimes, and evidence which is evidence of character 
  must be understood by you.</p>
<p class="indent">Positive evidence relevant to the crimes that you hear from 
  Miss Jones and [B] is not governed by this instruction and will properly form 
  part of the entire body of evidence that you must consider when determining 
  Mr. Pollock's guilt or innocence of these offences.</p>
<p class="indent">However, evidence relevant to Mr. Pollock's character has been 
  permitted only to assist you more fully and better to assess the validity and 
  credibility of the positive evidence of Teresa Jones and [B] which will be given 
  in this trial.</p>
<p>
  [49] Teresa Jones first met Pollock when he was still married to another woman. 
  The relationship between Jones and Pollock was marked by violence from Pollock. 
  In August 1993, Pollock had left his wife and Jones moved in with him. Jones 
  testified to a number of assaults on her by Pollock. She also testified that 
  in the house there were always drugs such as cocaine, marijuana and hashish, 
  which they both used.</p>
<p>
  [50] Jones also testified about Pollock's relationship with Morrisson. She explained 
  that Morrisson would visit approximately once or twice a week and would often 
  bring drugs with him. The frequency of the visits increased in the two weeks 
  before November 25th, and Jones overheard them planning a meeting at which Pollock 
  would meet someone whom Morrisson knew. Prior to the meeting, she and Pollock 
  drove around looking for an isolated location for the meeting. She recalled 
  going to an isolated area that seems to match the location of the killing.</p>
<p>
  [51] On the evening of November 25, 1993, Pollock dressed differently than he 
  usually did, and asked Jones for a pair of gloves. Pollock then left in Morrisson's 
  Bronco. The Bronco returned about an hour later and dropped Pollock off. Pollock 
  was in a rage; his face, neck and clothing were covered with blood and white 
  pieces of cartilage, as was his gun, which he was waving around. He was concerned 
  about cleaning his gun and talked about burying the gun. He asked Jones to wash 
  his clothing. She asked him if someone had died and he said that it was "really 
  fucking bad". Pollock also produced $1,000 in $100 bills, some hashish 
  and a big, bulky, gold man's ring. Pollock said that the ring had come from 
  the body or its finger. Pollock no longer had the gloves that Jones had given 
  him. He was also concerned that prints from his boots were left at the scene. 
  Those boots had disappeared. Pollock told Jones that if anyone asked, she was 
  to say that she had been at home with him that evening, watching a movie. At 
  Pollock's direction, Jones had rented a movie earlier that day. She was also 
  to say that she had never met Morrisson. Pollock also had said that he had expected 
  to have a large sum of money that evening since the person whom he would meet 
  was "such a dealer".</p>
<p>
  [52] Over objection by counsel for Morrisson, the Crown was permitted to lead 
  evidence from Jones that Pollock said, "Dave wimped out. He didn't do what 
  he was supposed to do". Counsel for Pollock supported admission of the 
  evidence. In light of the ruling allowing the evidence, Morrisson sought severance. 
  The application was dismissed. The trial judge cautioned the jury that this 
  statement was only evidence against Pollock.</p>
<p>
  [53] Jones also testified about her relationship with B. She and the appellant 
  usually saw B on a daily basis, generally for the purpose of obtaining cocaine 
  from him. She identified a photograph of B with a handgun similar to a gun that 
  Pollock owned. The gun with which Pollock had come home on the night of November 
  25th was not the gun in the photograph. A couple of days after November 25th, 
  she, B and Pollock went to Toronto. Pollock had a bag with him that she suspected 
  contained the gun with which Pollock had come home on November 25th. B went 
  into an apartment building with the bag and returned with some crack cocaine 
  but without the bag.</p>
<p>
  [54] In April 1994, Jones and Pollock moved to Vancouver. In early June 1994, 
  Pollock was arrested for conspiracy to commit robbery and brought back to Ontario. 
  Jones eventually returned to Ontario in order to assist Pollock in getting bail 
  on that charge. In her testimony at the bail hearing, she said that Pollock 
  never assaulted her and did not use drugs or sell drugs, all of which was untrue. 
  By September 1994, the relationship between Jones and Pollock had ended. Pollock, 
  however, was stalking her and occasionally assaulting her. Her last encounter 
  with Pollock was in October 1994 when she was out walking. Pollock confronted 
  her and then beat her very badly. She refused to lay charges against Pollock 
  because she was afraid of him.</p>
<p>
  [55] In January 1996, a police officer showed Jones a picture of a ring. The 
  ring resembled the one Pollock had with him on November 25th, but Jones told 
  the officer she had never seen it. Around the same time, Jones was charged with 
  trafficking in cocaine. She pleaded guilty in February 1997 and received four 
  months imprisonment. </p>
<p>
  [56] A few days before her parole hearing, Jones asked to speak to one of the 
  officers involved in the murder investigation. She told the officer that she 
  knew things about the murder and would provide information in exchange for help 
  on her parole application. The officer agreed to try to help, and Jones gave 
  a video statement to the police in March 1997. She testified that she had not 
  come forward earlier because she was afraid of Pollock. He was now in custody, 
  as of February 1996. She testified that Pollock had threatened her and threatened 
  to hurt her family. She was also afraid of people with whom Pollock associated, 
  especially one Fred Cartier who was a member of the Satan's Choice motorcycle 
  gang. She estimated that Pollock had assaulted her about thirty times. Counsel 
  for Pollock objected when Crown counsel led evidence of some of the specific 
  incidents. The trial judge curtailed further examination on the incidents except 
  to permit Jones to testify about two incidents when Pollock held a gun to her 
  head.</p>
<p>
  [57] In cross-examination, counsel for Morrisson adduced further evidence of 
  the assaults by Pollock and his use of cocaine. Counsel for Pollock objected 
  when Morrisson's counsel began to cross-examine Jones on individual incidents. 
  Morrisson's counsel argued that this evidence was necessary to explain why Morrisson 
  lied to the police. There was no evidence that Morrisson was aware of any of 
  the assaults by Pollock on Jones. Morrisson's counsel also now sought to use 
  this evidence to bolster A's evidence as to why he entered the witness protection 
  programme. </p>
<p>
  [58] The trial judge ruled that Morrisson's counsel could cross-examine Jones 
  on the various incidents. He ruled in part as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Mr. Kerbel objects to the line of questioning taken in the 
  cross-examination of Ms. Jones by counsel for Mr. Morrisson. The grounds of 
  the objection are four-fold.</p>
<p class="indent">Firstly, Mr. Cornale seeks to elicit from Ms. Jones evidence 
  of Mr. Pollock's relationship with her which were unknown to Mr. Morrisson or 
  said to be unknown to Mr. Morrisson. Occurrences which were unknown by this 
  argument cannot be appropriately used to address Mr. Morrisson's own relationship 
  with Mr. Pollock and his alleged parallel experiences. I reject this. To the 
  extent that persons involved in relationships with Mr. Pollock in which fear 
  is allegedly a predominant factor, based on awareness of the potential of Mr. 
  Pollock to act out is relevant to what we are told is the heart of the theory 
  of the defence of Mr. Morrisson.</p>
<p class="indent">While it is clear that this theory may change, the evidence 
  is admissible on this basis at this stage of the proceedings and cross-examinations 
  will not be curtailed on this ground.</p>
<p class="indent">Secondly, at the end of the day it would be impossible for the 
  jury not to misuse the evidence, whatever limiting instructions that I give 
  to it. This is essentially the same argument as was previously rejected by me 
  when the rights of Mr. Morrisson to explore and issues related to Mr. Pollock's 
  character were first raised during the cross-examination of [A]. I rejected 
  this argument at that time. I take the same position now.</p>
<p class="indent">Thirdly, the line of questioning will engage us in this trial 
  in time-consuming investigation of a series of incidents in which for that very 
  reason, the Crown was restricted by me. Mr. Morrisson should be similarly restricted 
  by this argument.</p>
<p class="indent">In my earlier ruling today, I indicated that the Crown could 
  "paint the issues with broad brush strokes."</p>
<p class="indent">I continued that I did not intend to engage in a series of mini-trials 
  before the jury. I reserve the right to revisit the Crown's rights in re-examination 
  after seeing how the cross-examination unfolds. I do not see that the questions 
  asked of this witness in cross-examination by Mr. Cornale thus far have been 
  at all time consuming or excessive. Mr. Cornale has addressed many events, but 
  he has not done so in a manner which has thus far engaged in time-consuming 
  detail which serves no purpose.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, Mr. Kerbel makes the point that the jury has the point. 
  In my view, counsel must determine how to best serve the interests of their 
  clients within the rules which address criminal trials.</p>
<p class="indent">Without being critical because counsel are engaged in full answer 
  and defence issues, I am certain that some issues have been repeatedly addressed 
  in cross-examination on behalf of Mr. Pollock. No one thus far has indicated 
  that some of those "points" have already been made and that, therefore, further 
  cross-examination on those points must end. I do not intend to limit Mr. Cornale's 
  right to fully address the interests of his client based upon this final ground. 
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [59] Counsel for Morrisson then asked Jones questions about several of the most 
  violent incidents. These incidents resulted in various injuries to Jones, including 
  broken bones. Jones also described incidents in which Pollock damaged property.</p>
<p>
  [60] Counsel for Morrisson also asked Jones whether Pollock would have reacted 
  violently if he had heard rumours on the street that Jones had been sleeping 
  with Weston. Counsel for Pollock objected and the objection was upheld.</p>
<p>
  [61] In cross-examination by counsel for Pollock, Jones confirmed that when 
  Morrisson visited their house the atmosphere was casual and relaxed, and there 
  was no indication that Morrisson feared Pollock. Counsel for Pollock also extensively 
  cross-examined Jones on various letters she had written to Pollock during his 
  incarceration, which suggested her continued love for him. </p>
<p>
  (k) B and disposal of the handgun</p>
<p>
  [62] B was 32 years of age at the time of trial. Like A, publication of his 
  identity was prohibited. He testified that in the fall of 1993, Pollock and 
  Jones came to his apartment. Pollock said he had something to show B in private. 
  The two of them went into another room where Pollock unwrapped a towel to reveal 
  a black 357 handgun with a wooden handle. There were marks all over the gun, 
  as if it had been dropped in gravel, and the marks, as well as the grooves in 
  the handle, were filled with brown and red stains that B assumed to be blood. 
  Pollock asked B if he could get rid of the gun and said it had been "used". 
  B agreed to do so, and they returned to Jones's car and drove to Toronto. They 
  drove to the Jane-and-Black-Creek area of Toronto where B went to an apartment 
  and met with someone named "Jackie" who lived with "O.J.". 
  Jackie gave B $100 for the gun, which B kept because Pollock owed B money from 
  a previous drug transaction.</p>
<p>
  [63] B was arrested in March 1994 for drug offences. The officers used the arrest 
  as an opportunity to question B about the Weston murder, and told B that Pollock 
  was under investigation for the murder. B said that he knew Pollock but knew 
  nothing about his connection to the murder. After he was released from the police 
  station, B returned to his apartment. He then decided to call the police and 
  tell them about the transaction with Pollock and the gun. B made a statement 
  to the police after telling the police that he would need protection. B then 
  agreed to talk to Pollock. B had several conversations with Pollock but did 
  not obtain any inculpatory statement from him except an inquiry from Pollock 
  about what he had told the police. B also made attempts to obtain the gun from 
  O.J., but without success. B had a criminal record for, among other things, 
  various drug and theft charges. He testified that he entered the witness protection 
  programme in 1994.</p>
<p>
  (l) Questioning B about Pollock's "lengthy" criminal record and criminal 
  associations</p>
<p>
  [64] As mentioned above, counsel for Morrisson asked B whether he was aware 
  of Pollock's lengthy criminal record, as well as Pollock's criminal involvement 
  and associates. Counsel for Morrisson also led evidence from B that B believed 
  that by providing information to the police his life would change, and that 
  he had a grave fear of retribution from Pollock and other persons, including 
  bikers. Over objection from counsel for Pollock, counsel led evidence that B 
  had received a call from one Silvain who had told him not to give evidence against 
  Pollock and that the word on the street was that B was "the rat on the 
  murder". The trial judge eventually intervened and upheld the objection 
  as there was no evidence of any connection between Silvain and Pollock. The 
  trial judge instructed the jury to disregard this evidence.</p>
<p>
  (m) Other evidence of Pollock's criminal record</p>
<p>
  [65] Morrisson's counsel also asked Perrin, one of the lead investigating officers, 
  whether he was aware that Pollock had a lengthy criminal record. Counsel for 
  Pollock objected and counsel agreed to move on to another topic. He then cross-examined 
  Perrin on whether he was aware of Pollock's "background with guns and for 
  violence". To mitigate the prejudice caused by this cross-examination, 
  counsel for Pollock adduced some of the details of Pollock's actual criminal 
  record, namely that he had four convictions including only one custodial disposition, 
  the last of which was in 1983. Perrin added, however, that there were "other 
  entries" in the record. In the presence of the jury, Crown counsel then 
  argued that Pollock's counsel should be required to go through "each and 
  every entry". The jury was excused and in the end the trial judge refused 
  to make such an order. It appears that Crown counsel wanted to force counsel 
  for Pollock to set out the details of the record such as each actual offence 
  and the sentence imposed. </p>
<p>
  (n) Police officers' opinions of Pollock's character</p>
<p>
  [66] Counsel for Morrisson asked a number of police officers their opinion of 
  Pollock. He asked Detective McMillan whether it became very clear during the 
  investigation that numerous witnesses expressed "great fear and concern" 
  about Pollock. He also asked McMillan if A's main reason for entering the witness-protection 
  programme was his fear of Pollock. Counsel for Pollock objected to both questions 
  and the trial judge ruled that the questions invited hearsay answers. Counsel 
  for Morrisson also established that McMillan did not carry his service revolver 
  when off duty except when Pollock was out of custody. Counsel for Morrisson 
  also asked McMillan and Detective Perrin whether they took their guns with them 
  when they went to Vancouver to bring Pollock back to Ontario. He asked Detective 
  Waller if he was aware of B's "ongoing fear" of Pollock. Again counsel's 
  objection was upheld. Counsel also attempted to have Waller testify about Morrisson's 
  fear. Waller testified that the only fear of which he was aware related to the 
  Arizona ploy.</p>
<p>
  [67] Counsel for Morrisson asked Waller whether, around the time of the arrest 
  of B, B was aware that Pollock was making inquiries about the homicide. The 
  trial judge warned counsel not to ask questions calling for inadmissible evidence. 
  Counsel then asked questions about the robbery conspiracy and the police surveillance 
  of Pollock. He asked similar questions of Detective Perrin and also suggested 
  that when Pollock was arrested in Vancouver, he was running from the police. 
  The trial judge upheld Pollock's counsel's objections to these various questions. 
  </p>
<p>
  [68] Morrisson's counsel also asked questions of Perrin about Pollock's character, 
  such as whether he was a self-destructive person. He also asked whether Jones, 
  A, B and Foster were in grave fear for their life in giving evidence. Counsel 
  for Pollock objected and the trial judge upheld the objection.</p>
<p>
  [69] Before Jones testified, counsel for Morrisson asked McMillan whether he 
  was aware from a family member of Jones that Jones was in hospital after having 
  been badly beaten by Pollock. Counsel for Pollock objected and the trial judge 
  ruled that the question called for a hearsay answer and was highly prejudicial.</p>
<p>
  (o) Morrisson's arrest</p>
<p>
  [70] Morrisson was arrested in February 1995. His counsel attempted to lead 
  evidence from one of the arresting officers of statements Morrisson made at 
  the time. The Crown objected and the trial judge ruled that Morrisson's counsel 
  could not lead this evidence. The officer did agree that Morrisson was very 
  cooperative. As a result of this evidence, counsel for Pollock attempted to 
  lead evidence from the officer that Morrisson had refused to take a polygraph 
  test on two occasions. The trial judge refused to admit this evidence.</p>
<p>
  [71] Morrisson was released on bail and over the next two years had short but 
  frequent conversations with one of the investigating officers who suggested 
  to Morrisson that Morrisson knew more about the killing than he had said in 
  his first statement on November 26, 1993. Counsel for Morrisson attempted to 
  lead evidence about a videotaped statement that Morrisson gave to the police 
  on July 15, 1997. Crown counsel objected and the trial judge ruled that counsel 
  could not ask about the statement.</p>
<p>
  8. Morrisson's evidence</p>
<p>
  [72] Morrisson was 34 years of age at the time of the trial. Sometime around 
  1992, he began to work for Terry McLean. He first met McLean in 1990, who offered 
  to sell hashish to him. At some point, McLean asked Morrisson to drive back 
  and forth to Montreal for him to pick up multi-kilo loads of hashish. Morrisson 
  did this once a month, or more frequently, for about one-and-one-half years. 
  Morrisson described himself as McLean's right-hand man during this period. According 
  to Morrisson, a man named Eddie Wilkinson was a major drug importer and was 
  higher on the drug scale than was McLean. Morrisson obtained hashish from Wilkinson 
  for McLean and delivered money to Wilkinson from McLean.</p>
<p>
  [73] Through a friend, Morrisson learned that Weston, who was also selling hashish, 
  no longer had a supplier for drugs. Morrisson therefore arranged for McLean 
  to supply hashish to Weston. As a result, Weston and Morrisson became friends. 
  Weston ordered increasingly large amounts of hashish from McLean through Morrisson. 
  Weston would pay Morrisson for the hashish. At some point, Weston asked to meet 
  McLean so that he could negotiate a better price for the hashish he was buying. 
  McLean agreed and Morrisson arranged the meeting. Thereafter, while Morrisson 
  was still the go-between for delivery of drugs and money, Weston negotiated 
  his own price.</p>
<p>
  [74] Morrisson first met Pollock some time after he met McLean. Despite objection 
  from counsel for Pollock on the basis that it was hearsay, Morrisson described 
  Pollock as McLean's bodyguard or chief of security, who was always with McLean. 
  According to Morrisson, McLean often travelled with large sums of money and 
  therefore needed someone who was armed to be with him. Pollock also occasionally 
  went to Montreal to pick up drugs. </p>
<p>
  [75] Morrisson testified that McLean had told him that Pollock had a 357-magnum 
  handgun. Morrisson also believed that Pollock owned a .22 revolver and a shotgun. 
  This evidence was adduced by Crown counsel. Pollock's counsel objected to the 
  Crown's questions about whether Pollock carried a gun, on the basis that this 
  evidence was hearsay.</p>
<p>
  [76] About one month after the meeting between Weston and McLean, a problem 
  developed. According to Morrisson, McLean was not supplying pure hashish and 
  Weston's customers rejected it. McLean replaced the hashish, but Weston believed 
  it was no better and demanded his money back in the amount of $24,000. McLean 
  refused. This was early 1992. </p>
<p>
  [77] In 1992, McLean's supply of hashish dried up and Morrisson stopped working 
  for him. He began to acquire drugs from other suppliers, including Weston, who 
  had access to good-quality marijuana from Arizona. As well, Pollock stopped 
  acting as McLean's bodyguard.</p>
<p>
  [78] Nevertheless, over the ensuing year, Morrisson arranged several meetings 
  between McLean and Weston to try and resolve the $24,000 debt. McLean claimed 
  to have no money. Ultimately, McLean told Weston that he had invested in a large 
  shipment of hashish that was to arrive by ship in the summer of 1993. After 
  that, McLean would repay Weston. However, McLean later told Morrisson that the 
  shipment had been detected and the authorities seized 18,000 kilograms of hashish.</p>
<p>
  [79] After this seizure, about a week before the shootings, Morrisson arranged 
  a meeting at Weston's insistence. At the meeting, McLean said that he would 
  not have the money to pay Weston. Weston was irate and the two men almost came 
  to blows. Weston then proposed a solution. Weston would "front" a 
  kilogram of cocaine to McLean who could sell it, thereby quickly generating 
  some cash. Morrisson testified that he was aware that Pollock would sell cocaine, 
  and that Pollock could sell the cocaine for McLean. McLean and Morrisson then 
  went to see Pollock and Pollock agreed to sell the cocaine. It was agreed that 
  as soon as Weston called Morrisson and advised him that the cocaine was available, 
  Morrisson would take Pollock to meet Weston and complete the deal.</p>
<p>
  [80] On the evening of November 25, 1993, Weston called Morrisson and asked 
  him to meet him at Smith's house before 9:00 p.m., or thereafter on their walking 
  route, with which Morrisson was familiar. Morrisson was unsure of whether the 
  purpose of the meeting was just for Pollock to meet Weston, or for Weston actually 
  to bring the cocaine. Morrisson also intended to take the opportunity to pay 
  Weston back some money he owed him. Weston fell asleep and only awoke around 
  9:00 p.m. He then drove to Pollock's house and picked him up around 9:30 p.m. 
  Curiously, Morrisson testified that he did not know whether Pollock was aware 
  of the meeting and did not even know if Pollock would be home when he went to 
  his house. Morrisson drove to Smith's house after picking up Pollock but as 
  the house was dark he drove Weston's walking route but did not find him. He 
  then drove to a spot on the route and waited in the truck for Weston. Pollock 
  left the vehicle, supposedly to urinate. </p>
<p>
  [81] A short time later, Morrisson heard a noise from behind the truck and assumed 
  Weston and Smith were approaching. Morrisson left the vehicle and walked around 
  to the rear of the truck. At that point, Pollock came out from behind a tree 
  and fired two shots, one of which hit Smith, who fell to the ground. Weston 
  turned and ran. Pollock fired two more shots and chased Weston, continuing to 
  shoot at him. Weston and Morrisson were yelling. Morrisson then heard a series 
  of blows and thuds. Morrisson initially froze and then returned to the truck. 
  At first he had trouble finding his keys. By then Pollock had re-entered the 
  truck. He had a gun in his right hand and was extremely agitated. Pollock told 
  Morrisson to drive. Morrisson asked Pollock, "what the fuck is your problem? 
  What did you do?" Pollock just told Morrisson to drive and held the gun 
  to Morrisson's side. Morrisson said he was in shock and afraid, and drove off. 
  He asked Pollock why he had done it and Pollock told him to check with McLean 
  and that Morrisson was supposed to know. Pollock told Morrisson to take him 
  home. Morrisson claimed that he was unaware that Pollock had been armed. Morrisson 
  dropped Pollock off at his home. Pollock told Morrisson to keep his mouth shut. 
  </p>
<p>
  [82] According to Morrisson, while he and Pollock were driving to Pollock's 
  house after the shooting, Pollock dropped Weston's ring on the floor of the 
  truck. Pollock picked it up and said it was some kind of "proof".</p>
<p>
  [83] Later that night Morrisson tried to reach McLean but was unsuccessful. 
  The next day he reached McLean who agreed to meet him. At the meeting, Morrisson 
  complained that McLean had again put him in the middle of a situation. McLean 
  told Morrisson to shut up, and that Pollock had done what he was paid to do. 
  Morrisson was concerned because the news reports of the killing indicated that 
  the police had a description of his truck. He said that he wanted to speak to 
  a lawyer. McLean suggested that he speak to Allan Mintz, a lawyer McLean claimed 
  to have on retainer. McLean told Morrisson to keep his mouth shut and said that 
  he could make it look very bad for Morrisson and that he knew where Morrisson 
  lived. Morrisson was very concerned about this comment because of what he had 
  just witnessed.</p>
<p>
  [84] Also on the morning of November 26th, Morrisson noticed and removed blood 
  from the passenger side of the truck. Morrisson denied that he had removed the 
  licence plates from the truck prior to driving to the meeting with Weston.</p>
<p>
  [85] After the meeting with McLean, Morrisson drove to Mr. Mintz's office and 
  waited for approximately five hours, until Mintz arrived. He then told Mintz 
  everything that had happened. Mintz said that he had already spoken to McLean. 
  Mintz told Morrisson that he, Morrisson, was just a witness and that he should 
  speak to the police but should not mention any names and should not allow himself 
  to be pinned down. Morrisson asked how he could tell the police what had happened 
  without mentioning names. Mintz told him he was a smart guy and would figure 
  it out and reminded him that it was very dark on the road where the shooting 
  took place. Mintz called the Halton police and told an officer that his client 
  was the driver of the Bronco. He set up a meeting at a doughnut shop at 6:30 
  p.m.</p>
<p>
  [86] Morrisson drove to the doughnut shop but Mintz was not there. While he 
  waited, he was approached by two police officers. They waited for about two 
  hours for Mintz. While they waited, Morrisson said that he had witnessed the 
  events of the previous evening. Finally, the police said they would interview 
  Morrisson the following day, but asked him to bring his truck to the police 
  station that evening. He did so and while there, Mintz called and spoke to one 
  of the officers and then to Morrisson. Mintz told Morrisson he had been held 
  up, and that he was just to tell the police what they had discussed earlier 
  and everything would be fine. Morrisson then gave a version of events which, 
  as he conceded at trial, was not complete. Morrisson left the truck and his 
  clothing with the police. He also offered to provide any further information 
  they might need about the drug sub-culture. Morrisson testified that his only 
  choices at that time were to lie to the police and walk away from the problem, 
  or to tell the truth and be killed by McLean or Pollock. However, he also testified 
  that the reason he did not give the names to the police was because of the advice 
  from Mr. Mintz. </p>
<p>
  [87] The following day, McLean asked to meet Morrisson. At Morrisson's insistence 
  they met in a public place. McLean wanted to know what Morrisson had told Mintz 
  and the police. Morrisson assured McLean that he had not mentioned McLean's 
  nor Pollock's name.</p>
<p>
  [88] A few days later, Pollock also asked to meet with Morrisson. Again Morrisson 
  agreed to meet him in a public place. During the brief meeting, Pollock asked 
  many of the same questions and Morrisson assured him that he did not 'rat him 
  out'. Pollock told Morrisson that if he kept his mouth shut everything would 
  be fine. Morrisson met with Pollock again in January 1994 after Pollock called 
  him and said that the police had been asking questions about him, Pollock. Morrisson 
  again assured Pollock that he had not mentioned Pollock's nor McLean's name. 
  Pollock told Morrisson he would remain alive as long as he kept his mouth shut. 
  </p>
<p>
  [89] Morrisson testified that during the trial he overheard Pollock threatening 
  him; specifically, Morrisson testified that Pollock called Morrison a "weasel" 
  and said he would choke Morrisson if he had the chance.</p>
<p>
  [90] Morrisson testified that he did not know where McLean was, but he continued 
  to fear him. He believed that McLean had killed another drug dealer who owed 
  McLean a large amount of money. Morrisson denied that it was McLean, not Pollock, 
  who was with him at the time of the shooting of Weston and Smith.</p>
<p>
  (9) Cross-examination of Morrisson on the "letters" to Pollock</p>
<p>
  [91] Counsel for Pollock vigorously cross-examined Morrisson. That cross-examination 
  included questions designed to show that Morrisson had lied about his background 
  during his examination-in-chief. Counsel for Pollock showed Morrisson a document 
  (later to become Exhibit 91). At first, Morrisson testified that he did not 
  recognize it and denied writing it. After Crown counsel had cross-examined Morrisson, 
  counsel for Pollock was permitted to cross-examine Morrisson on Exhibit 91 further. 
  By this time, a handwriting analysis had established that Morrisson had written 
  the document, a letter to Pollock. Morrisson maintained the position that he 
  did not remember writing the letter but accepted that he must have done so. 
  The document was obviously written after the pre-trial motions. In it, Morrisson 
  suggests that Pollock should take the position that he was on drugs and only 
  intended to rough up Weston on McLean's orders and therefore is guilty of manslaughter. 
  Otherwise, according to Morrisson, both of them would be convicted of first-degree 
  murder. Morrisson promises to take care of Pollock with money and a job waiting 
  for him when he gets out of jail. He also instructs Pollock to give the notes 
  back to him since "I won't feel safe until I have destroyed them personally." 
  The letter concludes with the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  So we have come full circle my friend. We used to trust each other more than 
  we trusted our own wives. I have no ill-will towards you. I know I ratted you 
  out. Where did it get me? The cops, the Crown, my lawyer, my family, everybody 
  wanted me to, I just wish I had just listened to my heart and shut up. Too late 
  for that now. What's done is done. I do not want to take the stand and neither 
  should you. We have to take this out of the hands of the jury or we'll be crucified. 
  If you wait till its your turn to testify it will be too late. You must come 
  forward now while it is still salvageable. Take it easy, man. I know you have 
  heavy things to think about. I'll get you some herb a.s.a.p. to make the thinking 
  easier!! Please know that I think about you all the time, and I always have 
  a good thought for you.</p>
<p>
  [92] Morrisson testified that the document was nothing more than notes to himself 
  but he could not say why he wrote it. Morrisson was then shown a second document 
  (Exhibit 92). Once again he did not recall writing it. Like the first document, 
  it is also addressed to "Rob". In the document, Morrisson explains 
  that they have two choices. Choice number one is that they both go their own 
  way and rely on their lawyers. The second choice is that Pollock alone takes 
  responsibility for the crime, claims he was on cocaine and alcohol, did not 
  mean to kill anyone and only wanted to rough him up a bit, and that Morrisson 
  did not know anything about it and only tried to cover up afterwards. The letter 
  includes the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There are huge things shaping up if this ends sometime soon. I know it sucks 
  being in there but a little more time is better than a lot more time Rob. All 
  I can do is give you my word that I will make things right between us out here. 
  Don't gamble with the next 25 yrs. of both our lives with an all or nothing 
  attitude. &#133; Please return this to me on Tues. Jan 27/98. It will be the 
  only present I want for my birthday.</p>
<p>
  [93] Morrisson denied giving the documents to Pollock but could not explain 
  how they came into Pollock's counsel's possession.</p>
<p>
  10. Evidence of Allan Mintz</p>
<p>
  [94] Pollock did not testify. He did, however, call Mr. Mintz as a defence witness. 
  He testified that when Morrisson came to his office on November 26, 1993, Morrisson 
  was visibly upset, distraught and panicked. He said that his life and family 
  were ruined. He said he had witnessed a shooting. He had gone to a remote area 
  of Burlington to meet his drug supplier and when he left his truck the shooting 
  occurred. Mr. Mintz told him he was just a witness and had nothing to worry 
  about. Morrisson explained that the media had broadcast a description of his 
  vehicle and that the police would find him. He also explained that he was concerned 
  that his involvement in drug trafficking would become known. Morrisson did not 
  mention either Pollock or McLean, nor did he say that they had threatened him. 
  Mintz denied advising Morrisson to lie to the police. </p>
<p>
  [95] Mintz arranged for Morrisson to meet with the police. He explained that 
  he did not make the meeting at the doughnut shop because he apparently went 
  to the wrong one. Mintz met with Morrisson several times after this first meeting. 
  Morrisson never said that he had lied to the police.</p>
<p>
  THE POLLOCK APPEAL</p>
<p>
  1. Unfair trial</p>
<p>
  Positions of the parties</p>
<p>
  [96] Pollock's principal ground of appeal is that the trial was manifestly unfair 
  to him. He submits that this unfairness stems from the trial judge's rulings 
  that permitted Morrisson to introduce highly prejudicial evidence. He argues 
  that much of the evidence that entered the trial on the theory that it was necessary 
  for Morrisson to make full answer and defence was not admissible for that purpose. 
  Pollock also argues that the trial was unfair because of the conduct of counsel 
  for Morrisson who repeatedly introduced inadmissible and highly prejudicial 
  evidence. </p>
<p>
  [97] The Crown provides three arguments in response to Pollock's submission 
  that the trial judge erred in permitting Morrisson to introduce the allegedly 
  prejudicial evidence. First, the Crown says that at the joint trial Morrisson 
  had the right to make full answer and defence, including adducing evidence of 
  Pollock's violent disposition to support the theory that Morrisson lied to the 
  police out of fear of Pollock. Second, the Crown submits that the nature of 
  Pollock's defence made this evidence admissible. Third, the Crown says that 
  the trial judge properly balanced Morrisson's right to make full answer and 
  defence with Pollock's right to a fair trial by giving complete and correct 
  instructions about the limited use to be made of the propensity evidence. As 
  to the alleged improper cross-examination by Morrisson's counsel, the Crown 
  concedes that some of counsel's comments and questioning were inappropriate. 
  However, much of the questioning was disallowed and ruled inadmissible, and 
  the jury was told to ignore the questions or comments. Thus, any inappropriate 
  questioning by Morrisson's counsel did not render the trial unfair.</p>
<p>
  2. Analysis</p>
<p>
  (a) Introduction</p>
<p>
  [98] At the root of Pollock's ground of appeal and the Crown's response is the 
  question of the right of one accused to attack the character of a co-accused. 
  Morrisson's counsel justified the introduction of evidence highly prejudicial 
  to Pollock on the theory that the evidence was necessary to ensure that Morrisson 
  received a fair trial and was able to make full answer and defence. To deal 
  with this issue I intend to review the rules respecting the admissibility of 
  character evidence briefly. I will then consider the application of those rules 
  to a joint trial. Finally, I will apply the law to the facts of this case.</p>
<p>
  (b) The admissibility of character evidence</p>
<p>
  [99] A succinct statement of the relevancy of character evidence may be found 
  in R. v. McMillan (1976), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 160 (Ont. C.A.), affirmed (1977), 33 
  C.C.C. (2d) 360 (S.C.C.), at 167, where Martin J.A. wrote: "The tendency 
  or disposition of a person to do a certain act is relevant to indicate the probability 
  of his doing or not doing the act." </p>
<p>
  [100] The law has, however, for a long time recognized the dangers of a trier 
  of fact, especially the lay triers in a jury, relying upon this evidence. In 
  R. v. Handy (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at paragraphs 37, 39 and 40, 
  Binnie J. summarized some of the dangers of relying upon evidence of the bad 
  character, propensity or disposition of an accused in relation to the similar 
  fact rule, a form of character evidence: </p>
<p class="indent"> The policy basis for the exclusion is that while in some cases 
  propensity inferred from similar facts may be relevant, it may also capture 
  the attention of the trier of fact to an unwarranted degree. Its potential for 
  prejudice, distraction and time consumption is very great and these disadvantages 
  will almost always outweigh its probative value. It ought, in general, to form 
  no part of the case which the accused is called on to answer. It is excluded 
  notwithstanding the general rule that all relevant evidence is admissible &#133; 
  .</p>
<p class="indent">It is, of course, common human experience that people generally 
  act consistently with their known character. We make everyday judgments about 
  the reliability or honesty of particular individuals based on what we know of 
  their track record. If the jurors in this case had been the respondent's inquisitive 
  neighbours, instead of sitting in judgment in a court of law, they would undoubtedly 
  have wanted to know everything about his character and related activities. His 
  ex-wife's anecdotal evidence would have been of great interest. Perhaps too 
  great, as pointed out by Sopinka J. in B. (C.R.), supra, at p. 744: </p>
<p class="indent"> The principal reason for the exclusionary rule relating to 
  propensity is that there is a natural human tendency to judge a person's action 
  on the basis of character. Particularly with juries there would be a strong 
  inclination to conclude that a thief has stolen, a violent man has assaulted 
  and a pedophile has engaged in pedophilic acts. Yet the policy of the law is 
  wholly against this process of reasoning.</p>
<p class="indent">The policy of the law recognizes the difficulty of containing 
  the effects of such information which, once dropped like poison in the juror's 
  ear, "swift as quicksilver it courses through the natural gates and alleys of 
  the body": Hamlet, Act I, Scene v, ll. 66-67. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [101] For these reasons, evidence of the accused's disposition is presumptively 
  inadmissible. As Binnie J. said in Handy at para. 64, "disposition evidence 
  could unusually and exceptionally be admitted if it survives the rigours of 
  balancing probative value against prejudice". Binnie J. returned to the 
  question of prejudice later in the Handy case and summarized the two types of 
  prejudice: moral prejudice and reasoning prejudice. He explained moral prejudice 
  in this way at para. 139: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is frequently mentioned that "prejudice" in this context is not 
  the risk of conviction. It is, more properly, the risk of an unfocussed trial 
  and a wrongful conviction. The forbidden chain of reasoning is to infer guilt 
  from general disposition or propensity. The evidence, if believed, shows that 
  an accused has discreditable tendencies. In the end, the verdict may be based 
  on prejudice rather than proof, thereby undermining the presumption of innocence 
  enshrined in ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
<p>
  [102] He explained the reasoning prejudice in this way at paras. 144-46: </p>
<p class="indent"> The major issue here is the distraction of members of the jury 
  from their proper focus on the charge itself aggravated by the consumption of 
  time in dealing with allegations of multiple incidents involving two victims 
  in divergent circumstances rather than the single offence charged.</p>
<p class="indent">Distraction can take different forms. In R. v. D. (L.E.) (1987), 
  20 B.C.L.R. (2d) 384, McLachlin J.A. (as she then was) observed at p. 399 that 
  the similar facts may induce</p>
<p class="indent">in the minds of the jury sentiments of revulsion and condemnation 
  which might well deflect them from the rational, dispassionate analysis upon 
  which the criminal process should rest.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, there is a risk, evident in this case, that where the 
  "similar facts" are denied by the accused, the court will be caught in a conflict 
  between seeking to admit what appears to be cogent evidence bearing on a material 
  issue and the need to avoid unfairness to the right of the accused to respond. 
  The accused has a limited opportunity to respond. Logistical problems may be 
  compounded by the lapse of time, surprise, and the collateral issue rule, which 
  will prevent (in the interest of effective use of court resources) trials within 
  trials on the similar facts. Nor is the accused allowed to counter evidence 
  of discreditable conduct with similar fact evidence in support of his or her 
  credibility (as discussed in Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, supra, at &sect;11.74). 
  Thus the practical realities of the trial process reinforce the prejudice inherent 
  in the poisonous nature of the propensity evidence itself.</p>
<p>
  [103] Even where one accused has been properly permitted to lead evidence of 
  a co-accused's character, the Crown is not entitled to rely upon that evidence 
  as proof of guilt. Doherty J.A. expressed the policy reasons for this rule in 
  R. v. Suzack (2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to the 
  Supreme Court of Canada dismissed [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 583, at para. 116: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is a fundamental tenet of our criminal justice system that criminal culpability 
  depends on the Crown's ability to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused 
  committed the specific act alleged in the indictment. It has been established 
  for over 100 years that the Crown cannot make its case by showing that the accused 
  engaged in misconduct other than that alleged against him for the purpose of 
  showing that the accused was the type of person who would commit the crime alleged. 
  Makin v. The Attorney General for New South Wales, [1894] A.C. 57 (P.C.) at 
  65. Propensity evidence and the reasoning that it invites imperil this fundamental 
  tenet by inviting conviction based on the kind of person the accused is shown 
  to be or based on acts other than those alleged against the accused: R. v. D. 
  (L.E.) (1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 142 (S.C.C.) at 161-162. I would not discard a 
  rule that is so central to an accused's right to a fair trial to further a co-accused's 
  right to make full answer and defence. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [104] Where the accused seeks to admit evidence of the violent disposition of 
  a third party, other than a co-accused, some of the policy reasons for excluding 
  the evidence at the instance of the Crown are attenuated. Martin J.A. dealt 
  with this issue in R. v. Scopelliti (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 481 (Ont. C.A.) at 
  493, a case involving the right of an accused who relied on self-defence to 
  adduce evidence of other acts of violence by the deceased, even acts that were 
  unknown to the accused: </p>
<p class="indent">
  We were not referred by counsel to any Canadian or Commonwealth decision on 
  the question of the admissibility of evidence of the deceased's character (disposition) 
  for violence, not known to the accused, as evidence of the probability of the 
  deceased's aggression where self-defence is raised as an issue. However the 
  admission of such evidence accords in principle with the view expressed by this 
  Court that the disposition of a person to do a certain act is relevant to indicate 
  the probability of his having done or not having done the act. The law prohibits 
  the prosecution from introducing evidence for the purpose of showing that the 
  accused is a person who by reason of his criminal character (disposition) is 
  likely to have committed the crime charged, on policy grounds, not because of 
  lack of relevance. There is, however, no rule of policy which excludes evidence 
  of the disposition of a third person for violence where that disposition has 
  probative value on some issue before the jury: see R. v. McMillan (1975), 23 
  C.C.C. (2d) 160 at p. 167, 7 O.R. (2d) 750, 29 C.R.N.S. 191; affirmed, 33 C.C.C. 
  (2d) 360, 73 D.L.R. (3d) 759, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824; R. v. Schell and Paquette 
  (1977), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 422 at p. 426. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [105] However, the policy rules that generally preclude admission of evidence 
  of the accused's bad character at the instance of the Crown re-emerge where 
  one accused seeks to lead the evidence against a co-accused. As where the Crown 
  seeks to lead the evidence, there is a risk that the evidence will be unduly 
  prejudicial because the jury will attach too much weight, in relation to its 
  probative value, to the evidence led by one accused against a co-accused. There 
  are also the concerns that the evidence may unduly distract from the issues, 
  be too time-consuming in relation to its probative value, or unfairly surprise 
  the accused against whom the evidence is led.</p>
<p>
  [106] Accordingly, since evidence of propensity or bad character can carry a 
  very grave risk of prejudice to the fair trial of the accused against whom the 
  evidence is led, it is incumbent on the trial judge to examine closely the probative 
  value of the evidence and the purposes for which the evidence is tendered. In 
  my view, in a joint trial, counsel's mere assertion that the evidence is necessary 
  for the accused to make full answer and defence is not sufficient given the 
  grave potential for prejudice to the fair trial of a co-accused. There must 
  be some evidentiary foundation to support this assertion. That foundation may 
  come during the Crown's case through evidence of Crown witnesses in chief or 
  through cross-examination. In some cases, the evidentiary foundation may not 
  be laid until the defence case. If so, the prejudicial character evidence would 
  only be admissible, if at all, at that time. The need for this evidentiary foundation 
  is not simply to avoid irrelevant evidence entering the record. An evidentiary 
  foundation is essential to ensure fair management of the trial. The need for 
  the highly prejudicial evidence can be properly assessed only when the accused 
  demonstrates through evidence the contours of the defence. Until then, the trial 
  judge is left to speculate on the importance and necessity of this evidence.</p>
<p>
  [107] In deciding whether to admit evidence on behalf of one accused of the 
  co-accused's disposition, the trial judge is required to balance the fair trial-rights 
  of the two accused. In some cases, the trial judge will conclude that a fair 
  balance cannot be struck within the confines of a single trial and the judge 
  will grant severance. In most cases, however, it should be possible to balance 
  the fair trial rights of both accused. </p>
<p>
  [108] In Suzack at para. 111, Doherty J.A. explained the trial judge's duty 
  to balance the rights of co-accused in a joint trial: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where accused are tried jointly, each is entitled to the constitutional protections 
  inherent in the right to a fair trial. Those protections include the right to 
  make full answer and defence and the right to be shielded from evidence which 
  unfairly prejudices an accused. An accused's right to a fair trial does not, 
  however, entitle that accused to exactly the same trial when tried jointly as 
  the accused would have had had he been tried alone: R. v. Crawford, supra, at 
  pp. 497-98; R. v. Pelletier (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 533 (B.C.C.A.). In joint 
  trials, one accused may elicit evidence or make submissions in support of his 
  defence that are prejudicial to the other accused and could not have been elicited 
  or made by the Crown. In those cases, the respective rights of each accused 
  must be balanced by the trial judge so as to preserve the overall fairness of 
  the trial. In Crawford, supra, Sopinka J. said, at p. 498: </p>
<p class="indent"> I have gone to some length to stress that Charter rights are 
  not absolute in the sense that they cannot be applied to their full extent regardless 
  of the context. Application of Charter values must take into account other interests 
  and, in particular, other Charter values which may conflict with their unrestricted 
  and literal enforcement. This approach to Charter values is especially apt in 
  this case, in that the conflicting rights are protected under the same section 
  of the Charter.</p>
<p class="indent">[Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [109] One way in which the trial judge will balance the rights of co-accused 
  is by instructing the jury as to limitations on the use of evidence. In Suzack, 
  Doherty J.A. explained how the trial judge was required to instruct the jury 
  that evidence of the propensity of the accused adduced by the co-accused was 
  admissible to raise a reasonable doubt on behalf of that co-accused but could 
  not be used by the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused. A similar solution 
  was adopted in R. v. Crawford (1995), 96 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.), referred 
  to in the above quotation, where the Supreme Court held that while an accused 
  could lead evidence of the co-accused's silence upon arrest, the trial judge 
  was required to instruct the jury that the evidence was relevant only to the 
  accused's credibility (the co-accused's testimony implicated the accused) and 
  was not evidence of the co-accused's guilt.</p>
<p>
  [110] Where the Crown seeks to adduce character evidence of an accused, as with 
  similar fact evidence, the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its 
  prejudicial effect. The balancing is different where one accused seeks to introduce 
  character evidence of a co-accused. The power to exclude relevant evidence adduced 
  by an accused is narrower: R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577. It would seem 
  that the evidence is admissible unless its prejudicial effect substantially 
  outweighs its probative value.</p>
<p>
  [111] In this case, the trial judge did place limits on the use the jury could 
  make of the propensity evidence adduced by Morrisson. However, in my view, in 
  balancing the interests of Morrisson and Pollock the trial judge also had a 
  duty to ensure that Pollock's right to a fair trial was not overwhelmed by the 
  admission of propensity evidence that Morrisson asserted was necessary for him 
  to make full answer and defence. The trial judge could only have protected Pollock's 
  right to a fair trial by ensuring that the evidence Morrisson sought to introduce 
  was probative of a live issue in the case, and by ensuring that the prejudicial 
  effect of that evidence did not substantially outweigh its probative value. 
  I will now turn to that issue.</p>
<p>
  (c) Application of the rules to this case</p>
<p>
  [112] The policy reasons for excluding evidence of the disposition of an accused 
  applied in this case. The evidence of bad character that Morrisson sought to 
  introduce showed Pollock as violent, unstable and abusive. A wide range of actors 
  in the case including criminals, Pollock's spouse and police officers expressed 
  a fear of Pollock or offered an opinion about his dangerousness. It would be 
  very easy for the jury to reason from this general evidence of propensity that 
  Pollock was the very type of person likely to have committed these heinous crimes 
  and therefore to reason to guilt, irrespective of any weaknesses in the prosecution's 
  case. In other words, there was a real danger that the jury would give this 
  evidence weight out of all proportion to its legitimate probative value.</p>
<p>
  [113] That was not the only prejudice from this evidence. The prejudice to a 
  fair trial from unfair surprise loomed large in this case. From the moment that 
  Morrisson's counsel surprised Pollock with the question to A about the threat, 
  Pollock was continually at a disadvantage. His counsel was constantly required 
  to object in the presence of the jury to lines of questioning from Morrisson's 
  counsel that Pollock's counsel feared would lead to more and more prejudicial 
  and inadmissible evidence. In the following passage, Pollock's counsel expressed 
  his frustration and concern about the manner in which the trial was progressing 
  in the course of Teresa Jones's evidence: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I wanted to make a brief statement. The last event that occurred before the 
  jury was my objection to one of Mr. Cornale's questions and Your Honour's ruling 
  and specifically it was on a question that the Crown had been disallowed so 
  I am going to take the opportunity of refraining from any further objections 
  because it's not appreciated I'm sure by the jury, and I really frankly can't 
  be sure when an objection would or wouldn't be appropriate, particularly since 
  the boundaries are clearly different in the case of Mr. Cornale as compared 
  to the Crown. All I can say to the court is that I'm trusting that the court 
  will recognize and deal with any violations of your ruling. I feel that it's 
  prejudicial to my client that I'm put in a position where I have to constantly 
  object especially when I cannot be sure what the parameters are given that this 
  is a co-accused questioning so I'm going to refrain from objecting, Your Honour. 
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [114] I should point out that notwithstanding this comment, counsel for Pollock 
  did continue to raise objections to some of the most egregious questions from 
  Morrisson's counsel, such as when Morrisson's counsel asked Jones whether Pollock 
  would have reacted violently if he heard that she had been sleeping with Weston.</p>
<p>
  [115] The disposition evidence also caused the problems of undue distraction 
  from the issues and undue consumption of time. As a result of Morrisson's counsel's 
  questions, large amounts of time were spent exploring the robbery conspiracy, 
  the fears of various witnesses, the many assaults by Pollock on Jones, the views 
  of police officers of Pollock's character and various hearsay utterances. Further, 
  while most of the prejudicial evidence entered the case through questions from 
  Morrisson's counsel, on a few occasions, counsel for the Crown was permitted 
  to lead evidence on the theory that Morrisson's counsel would inevitably do 
  so. This was not a major part of the problem in the case, but it did serve to 
  confuse the issues further as to whether the evidence was led to bolster Morrisson's 
  defence or as positive evidence of Pollock's guilt.</p>
<p>
  [116] In fairness to the trial judge, he could not predict all that would flow 
  from his initial ruling during A's testimony that Morrisson could adduce evidence 
  of Pollock's threat. As well, the trial judge frequently cautioned the jury 
  about the use to be made of the bad character evidence. In my view, however, 
  the trial judge erred in admitting much of the evidence of Pollock's disposition, 
  and this led to a trial that was unfair to Pollock. Questions, asked by Morrisson's 
  counsel, that were outside the scope of any ruling or that called for hearsay 
  and prejudicial answers further aggravated the situation. Surprisingly, even 
  when the trial judge instructed counsel to move off an area in response to an 
  objection, Morrisson's counsel would return to the same area with another witness.</p>
<p>
  [117] As I have said above, Morrisson claimed to be entitled to lead evidence 
  of Pollock's violent disposition principally on the theory that it supported 
  Morrisson's defence that he gave his first untruthful statement to the police 
  out of fear of Pollock. That submission could rest on two propositions, the 
  first one being that Morrisson knew of Pollock's violent disposition and for 
  that reason was afraid of him. Only acts of violence of which Morrisson was 
  aware would logically support this proposition. None of the evidence of Pollock's 
  violent disposition adduced by Morrisson fell into that category.</p>
<p>
  [118] The alternative proposition was that Morrisson's fear of Pollock was objectively 
  reasonable because of threats and acts of violence by Pollock towards others, 
  even though Morrisson was unaware of those acts. It is the evidence adduced 
  in support of this proposition that is at the heart of this appeal. The probative 
  value of this evidence depended on two findings of fact: first, that Morrisson 
  was afraid of Pollock, and second, that it was this fear, rather than another 
  motivation such as Morrisson's own apparent involvement in the transaction, 
  for example, that led him to lie to the police. In my view, at the stage that 
  Morrisson's counsel sought to introduce evidence of Pollock's disposition, there 
  was no evidence to support either proposition. While there was some evidence 
  from Morrisson's demeanour when dealing with the police that he was in fear, 
  there was no evidence during the Crown's case that this fear was the result 
  of anything done by Pollock or that Morrisson feared Pollock. One of the few 
  people who knew Pollock and Morrisson, Teresa Jones, testified that she saw 
  no evidence that Morrisson was afraid of Pollock. Further, the police surveillance 
  evidence showed meetings between Morrisson and Pollock after the shootings. 
  Finally, in my view, the fact that unknown to Morrisson, Pollock engaged in 
  violent acts or threats of violence to others was not sufficient on its own 
  to support the twin inferences that Morrisson feared Pollock and provided the 
  false statement out of fear.</p>
<p>
  [119] Before a trial judge is entitled to permit one accused to adduce evidence 
  of the bad character of a co-accused, the judge must be satisfied that the evidence 
  is necessary for the accused to make full answer and defence. In my view, in 
  a joint trial where the evidence was so potentially prejudicial to his co-accused, 
  Morrisson's counsel's bare assertion that the evidence was necessary for Morrisson 
  to make full answer and defence was not a sufficient basis for making a finding 
  that the evidence met that test. The principal problem in this case was that 
  the trial judge admitted evidence where there was nothing to suggest that the 
  evidence was relevant to a live issue in the case. </p>
<p>
  [120] In Scopelliti, the court had to consider the admissibility of evidence 
  of prior acts of violence unknown to the accused, tendered to support a defence 
  of self-defence. Martin J.A. held at p. 493 that in that context, a threshold 
  condition had to be met: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Dean Wigmore would require as a condition of the admissibility of evidence with 
  respect to the uncommunicated character of the deceased for violence, where 
  self-defence is an issue, the existence of some other appreciable evidence of 
  the deceased's aggression on the occasion in question; otherwise, the deceased's 
  bad character may be put forward improperly as a mere excuse for the killing 
  under the pretext of evidencing his aggression (ibid., pp. 469-0). I would agree 
  with this limitation. The additional evidence of the deceased's aggression may, 
  in my view, however, emanate from the accused. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [121] The trial judge was required to apply an analogous condition in this case. 
  Before the bad character evidence was admissible, there had to be some appreciable 
  evidence of Morrisson's fear of Pollock because of his violent disposition, 
  as well as some appreciable evidence that this fear motivated the false statement. 
  Otherwise, the evidence of bad character was nothing more than character assassination. 
  As I have said, that evidence could come from cross-examination of Crown witnesses 
  or some other evidence in the Crown's case. But that foundation had to be laid 
  before such prejudicial evidence was potentially admissible. If Morrisson could 
  not lay that foundation in the Crown's case, admission of the character evidence 
  would have to await a ruling during the defence case.</p>
<p>
  [122] Even if there was some basis for finding that Morrisson's fear of Pollock 
  was a live issue in the case, the trial judge still had to consider not only 
  whether the proposed evidence was probative but whether the probative value 
  was sufficient to warrant its admissibility. Martin J.A. also addressed this 
  issue in Scopelliti at p. 496: </p>
<p class="indent"> I agree, of course, that evidence of previous acts of violence 
  by the deceased, not known to the accused, must be confined to evidence of previous 
  acts of violence which may legitimately and reasonably assist the jury in arriving 
  at a just verdict with respect to the accused's claim of self-defence. To exclude, 
  however, evidence offered by the accused which is relevant to prove his innocence 
  would not, in my view, be in the interests of justice.</p>
<p class="indent">Since evidence of prior acts of violence by the deceased is 
  likely to arouse feelings of hostility against the deceased, there must inevitably 
  be some element of discretion in the determination whether the proffered evidence 
  has sufficient probative value for the purpose for which it is tendered to justify 
  its admission. Moreover, great care must be taken to ensure that such evidence, 
  if admitted, is not misused. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [123] Thus, the evidence must be legitimately and reasonably capable of assisting 
  the jury in arriving at a just verdict. Not all evidence of a violent disposition 
  can necessarily meet that test. There must be some legitimate and reasonable 
  nexus between the proffered evidence and the inference sought to be drawn by 
  the accused. Further, the evidence must have "sufficient probative value" 
  for the purpose for which it is tendered. As this court explained in the subsequent 
  decision in R. v. Yaeck (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 545, leave to appeal to the Supreme 
  Court of Canada refused (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) vii, at 567, referring to R. 
  v. Seaboyer at p. 406, the value of the evidence must outweigh its potential 
  prejudice to the conduct of a fair trial. Sufficiency implies more than simple 
  bare probative value. As I indicated above, since this is defence evidence, 
  exclusion of relevant evidence is justified only if "the potential prejudice 
  to the trial process of admitting the evidence clearly outweighs its value" 
  [Yaeck at p. 566, referring to Seaboyer at pp. 391-92].</p>
<p>
  [124] In considering the admissibility of the evidence of Pollock's disposition, 
  the trial judge had to find that the evidence had sufficient probative value 
  to warrant its reception. He needed to consider whether the evidence would mislead 
  the jury, would involve an inordinate amount of time, would unduly distract 
  the jury from the real issues in the case or would cause unfair surprise to 
  Pollock's defence. The trial judge did not take these other issues into consideration. 
  He focused solely on the assertion from counsel that the evidence was necessary 
  for Morrisson's defence.</p>
<p>
  [125] The most important factor in considering the value of the evidence of 
  Pollock's disposition was that the evidence was being tendered to support Morrisson's 
  state of mind and yet the incidents were unknown to Morrisson. This factor alone 
  suggested that the trial judge had to be very cautious about admitting this 
  evidence. The cases to which the trial judge was referred at trial such as R. 
  v. Suzack, R. v. Crawford and R. v. Kendall and McKay, (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 
  105 (Ont. C.A.) were very different from this case. In those cases, one accused 
  sought to lead evidence of the violent propensity of the co-accused to show 
  that of the two, it was more likely that it was the co-accused who killed the 
  victim. However, it was never Pollock's defence that it was Morrisson and not 
  he who had committed the murder and shot Smith. There was simply no question 
  that the gunman, i.e. the person other than Morrisson, had shot Smith and Weston. 
  Pollock's position was that the Crown had not proved he was the perpetrator 
  and that it was open to the jury to find that the real perpetrator was McLean. 
  </p>
<p>
  [126] While at one point Morrisson's counsel asserted that the propensity evidence 
  was relevant for the jury to determine whether it was Morrisson or Pollock who 
  committed the murder and attempted murder, that choice was never a realistic 
  or live issue. On the evidence, the gunman was the principal offender. No one 
  suggested that this was Morrison. Thus, the application of the principles in 
  the Suzack line of cases had to be approached with caution. The propensity evidence 
  in this case was relevant, if at all, for a much more limited purpose, as circumstantial 
  evidence of Morrisson's state of mind.</p>
<p>
  [127] If Morrisson's fear of Pollock had been a live issue at the time it was 
  admitted, evidence of the threat by Pollock to A might have been probative. 
  It would have made Morrisson's assertion that he was threatened by Pollock more 
  probable. The other evidence of Pollock's disposition was more problematic. 
  It had tenuous value in showing that Morrisson had been threatened by Pollock 
  or in supporting Morrisson's fear of Pollock.</p>
<p>
  [128] Thus, even if some of the evidence might be admissible to support the 
  desired inferences, not all of the disposition evidence was admissible. For 
  example, in Scopelliti, the court held that evidence of specific acts of violence 
  would be admissible to prove the deceased's propensity for violence in order 
  to support the self-defence-position of the accused. In this case, however, 
  the evidence went far beyond that limit and, for example, included expressions 
  of opinion by police officers and witnesses of their fear of Pollock. In balancing 
  the interests of Pollock and Morrisson, the trial judge should have excluded 
  this evidence because it was of trivial probative value in showing that Morrisson 
  made his statement to the police out of fear of Pollock.</p>
<p>
  [129] There is one last issue to be addressed on this aspect of the ground of 
  appeal. In the end, Morrisson did testify and did assert that he had been threatened 
  by Pollock and was afraid of Pollock. Thus, it could be argued that no prejudice 
  was occasioned because the evidence of Pollock's violent disposition would inevitably 
  have been admissible during Morrisson's defence. The difficulty with this reasoning 
  is that it is not at all clear that the trial judge would have admitted any 
  or all of the disposition evidence after Morrisson had testified. The theory 
  that Morrisson lied to the police because of fear of Pollock was somewhat uncertain 
  in view of Morrisson's own evidence that he lied on instructions from his then 
  lawyer (admittedly denied by the lawyer when he was called by Pollock). In any 
  event, the trial judge would, by then, have had a much clearer picture of what 
  was really in issue in the case and what evidence was actually necessary to 
  support the defence theory. More importantly, had the trial judge, early on, 
  ruled against Morrisson on this issue, that is until Morrisson's fear of Pollock 
  was a live issue, it is unlikely that all of the evidence which was clearly 
  inadmissible would have been adduced, such as the opinions of police officers 
  and others of Pollock's character, the references to Pollock's criminal record 
  and his criminal associations.</p>
<p>
  [130] Thus, I do not agree with the Crown's principal submission on this aspect 
  of the appeal, that the evidence of Pollock's violent disposition was properly 
  admitted so that Morrisson could make full answer and defence.</p>
<p>
  [131] I now wish to turn to the Crown's other submissions in support of the 
  trial judge's rulings and the admissibility of the evidence of Pollock's disposition.</p>
<p>
  (d) The nature of Pollock's defence</p>
<p>
  [132] Pollock forcefully attacked the prosecution's case. He claimed that the 
  investigation was flawed. He also claimed that the police were guilty of "tunnel 
  vision" in that they focussed on Pollock to the exclusion of other suspects. 
  He also attacked the motives of the various witnesses for testifying, including 
  those who had entered the witness-protection programme. The Crown submits, for 
  example, that since Pollock challenged A's motives for becoming a Crown witness 
  and entering the witness-protection programme, evidence that A's real motive 
  was fear of Pollock was admissible to prevent the jury from getting an unfair 
  and distorted picture. There would be much to say in favour of this kind of 
  argument but for the fact that the cross-examination of A by Pollock's counsel 
  came after the ruling permitting Morrisson to lead the evidence of the threat 
  to kill. In other words, the manner in which Pollock's defence was conducted 
  must be put in context. Finally, evidence that witnesses have been placed in 
  a witness-protection programme can be highly prejudicial. Such evidence can 
  have the tendency to undermine the presumption of innocence. The jury will naturally 
  assume that persons in authority have determined that the accused are guilty 
  and that witnesses need to be protected from them. The trial judge will ordinarily 
  take steps to minimize the prejudice to the defence when such evidence comes 
  out during a trial. Something of the reverse happened here. Morrisson was permitted 
  to explore the witnesses' reasons for entering the programme and place the blame 
  for their need to do so at Pollock's feet.</p>
<p>
  [133] The Crown also supports the trial judge's rulings that the nature of the 
  cross-examination of A made relevant Pollock's membership in the conspiracy 
  and the "triggerman" comment. As indicated, after counsel for Morrisson 
  and Pollock had both cross-examined A, the trial judge permitted counsel for 
  Morrisson to cross-examine A further and to adduce evidence that Pollock was 
  a member of the robbery conspiracy. The basis for the ruling was that in cross-examining 
  A on the conspiracy, counsel had adduced the names of the other conspirators, 
  which would leave a misleading impression that Pollock was not a member of the 
  conspiracy. This was an error. Pollock was not on trial for conspiracy to commit 
  robbery. The fact that the jury might erroneously conclude that Pollock was 
  not a member of the conspiracy was irrelevant.</p>
<p>
  [134] As to the "triggerman" comment in paragraph 38, I have set out 
  the chronology that led to this evidence. In short, the trial judge ruled that 
  A would be allowed to answer the question on the basis that for the trial judge 
  to prevent him from answering the question would "[look] like the defence 
  of Mr. Pollock is being restricted in some way, shape or form", despite 
  the fact that Pollock was objecting to the witness answering the question. There 
  was no basis for admitting this evidence or permitting the further evidence 
  from Officer Albano. As it turned out, most of this evidence was nothing more 
  than hearsay and inadmissible on that ground.</p>
<p>
  [135] Crown counsel submits that Pollock's own counsel adduced evidence of his 
  criminal record, which minimized the prejudicial effect of cross-examination 
  by Morrisson's counsel about Pollock's lengthy criminal record and his background 
  with guns and for violence. However, the point is that these questions should 
  not have been permitted in the first place, and it was unfair to place Pollock 
  in the position of having to adduce his own criminal record. I am also concerned 
  about Crown counsel's comments about "other entries", which may have 
  left the jury with the impression that parts of the record that would support 
  Morrisson's counsel's questions had been kept from them.</p>
<p>
  [136] The Crown's strongest argument on this aspect of the case relates to the 
  evidence of Teresa Jones. It was clear that counsel for Pollock would attack 
  Jones's credibility, in part, on the basis that she had told the police over 
  several years that Pollock had nothing to do with the killing. It was also part 
  of the defence theory that she only came forward when she was seeking parole. 
  Accordingly, it was open to Crown counsel to anticipate that line of attack 
  by adducing evidence from Jones that she made the prior inconsistent statements 
  out of fear of Pollock. See R. v. Speid (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 534 (Ont. C.A.) 
  at 546-54. It was also open to Crown counsel to lead evidence as to the basis 
  for this fear. Thus, some of the evidence that Crown counsel and counsel for 
  Morrisson led from Jones of Pollock's violent disposition was properly admissible.</p>
<p>
  [137] However, as recognized by the trial judge, that evidence had to be kept 
  within reasonable bounds to prevent the trial from being diverted from a murder 
  trial to a trial of abuse by Pollock on Jones. Thus, in his initial ruling, 
  the trial judge made it clear to Crown counsel that he did not want to become 
  entangled in forty "mini-trials" and that Crown counsel was to ask 
  questions that "paint[ed] the issues with broad brush strokes". That 
  ruling changed, however, when counsel for Morrisson engaged in cross-examination 
  of Jones. As the ruling reproduced at para. 58 shows, the trial judge placed 
  no such limits on Morrisson's counsel, and Morrisson's counsel therefore took 
  the opportunity to go into considerable detail over some of the incidents. Those 
  details included the various injuries, hospital admissions and threats by Pollock 
  to rape Jones's mother and hurt her father. Counsel's final question was whether 
  Pollock would react violently if he had heard that she had been sleeping with 
  Weston. There was no evidence to support this suggestion. Counsel for Morrisson 
  did not suggest that he had instructions that any such statement had been made. 
  He relied instead on the fact that Detective McMillan had heard this rumour 
  from an unreliable informant. The trial judge rightly ruled that the question 
  was improper. Compare R. v. Lyttle (2004), 180 C.C.C. (3d) 476 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  (e) The jury instructions</p>
<p> [138] The Crown submits that the trial judge properly balanced Morrisson's 
  right to make full answer and defence with Pollock's right to a fair trial by 
  giving the jury complete and correct jury instructions as to the limited use 
  to be made of the propensity evidence adduced by Morrisson. There is much to 
  be said for this submission. The trial judge gave frequent directions to the 
  jury as the bad-character evidence was led. I have set out some of those directions 
  above. In addition, in the charge to the jury, the trial judge gave directions 
  to which no objection was taken at trial. Thus, the trial judge told the jury 
  the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>They must not conclude that either Morrisson or Pollock is a person of bad 
    character and therefore more likely to have committed the offences;</li>
  <li>Evidence of Pollock's propensity and disposition for violence was necessary 
    because of Morrisson's defence that he was afraid of Pollock; this evidence 
    supported the reasonableness of Morrisson's fears and explained his delay 
    in coming forward and identifying Pollock as the shooter;</li>
  <li>The jury must not misuse such evidence; each accused must be tried not for 
    the type of person that he is or is alleged to be, but whether the offences 
    that he has been charged with were committed;</li>
  <li>Evidence of disposition cannot be used as evidence that either of them is 
    a bad person with a disposition or propensity for crime and/or for violence, 
    and therefore committed or is more likely to have committed the crimes charged;</li>
  <li>The jury cannot use evidence of disposition, propensity, or bad character 
    to convict either accused to punish them for past acts; such evidence is not 
    positive evidence of guilt;</li>
  <li>The jury must not infer from the evidence relating to the disposition or 
    character of either Morrisson or Pollock that simply because of his disposition 
    or character, he is a person who must have committed the crimes or is more 
    likely to have committed them.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [139] The trial judge also went out of his way to deal with particular pieces 
  of evidence. For example, he instructed the jury that A's "triggerman" 
  comment to Officer Albano could not be used for any purpose except to determine 
  A's credibility. He told the jury that Pollock was not on trial for having abused 
  Ms. Jones and this could not be used as evidence that he committed the offences 
  charged.</p>
<p>
  [140] While these instructions and others given during the trial are important 
  considerations, in my view, they cannot overcome the prejudicial effect of the 
  evidence of Pollock's character. Counsel for Morrisson seemed never to miss 
  an opportunity to ask questions calling for prejudicial and inadmissible evidence. 
  I am also concerned that some of the proceedings were particularly unfair to 
  Pollock, such as the attempt to adduce from an experienced police officer evidence 
  of his own fear of Pollock. This bad character evidence pervaded the trial and 
  rendered the trial unfair to Pollock: See R. v. Dhillon (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 
  262 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 48.</p>
<p>
  [141] Finally, while the trial judge gave many instructions to the jury as to 
  the limited use of much of the bad character evidence, a key instruction on 
  this issue is somewhat problematic. The trial judge directed the jury as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Thus, evidence of the disposition of Mr. Pollock and/or of 
  the disposition of Mr. Morrisson, cannot be used by you as evidence that either 
  of them, considered separately and independently on the evidence which relates 
  only to them, is a bad person with a disposition or propensity for crime and/or 
  for violence, and therefore, one or the other or both of these accused committed 
  or is more likely to have committed the crimes set out in the indictment.</p>
<p class="indent">No accused person should ever be convicted of an offence where 
  he is innocent. While this is important whenever a crime is alleged, and in 
  serious crimes this is especially important, you cannot use evidence of disposition, 
  propensity, bad character or similar, to convict either accused of these offenses 
  in order either to punish him for past acts. Such evidence is not positive of 
  evidence of the guilt of either Mr. Morrisson or Mr. Pollock in relation to 
  these crimes. If you were to find that either Mr. Pollock or Mr. Morrisson guilty 
  of either charge, in order to punish him for misconduct which is not the subject 
  matter of either charge in the indictment, you would be in grievous error. This 
  would result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p class="indent">You must not infer from evidence which relates to the kind of 
  person that either Mr. Morrisson or Mr. Pollock is, simply because of his disposition, 
  or propensity, or character, or other similar reason, that he is a person who 
  must have committed one or both of the crimes set out in the indictment, or 
  is more likely to have committed one or both of the crimes, and, therefore, 
  convict on that basis.</p>
<p class="indent">However, you can take such evidence into consideration when 
  considering the whole of the evidence which relates to each accused, considered 
  separately and independently to determine whether on the whole of the proper 
  evidence, the Crown has proved the guilt of that accused beyond a reasonable 
  doubt of either or both the charges set out in the indictment. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [142] The trial judge then went on to deal specifically with the evidence of 
  the use of drugs relating to both appellants and with the evidence of gun ownership 
  by Pollock. With respect to the evidence of drugs, the trial judge directed 
  the jury that this evidence was admitted because it formed part of the background 
  against which the crimes were said to have occurred. It would have been preferable 
  if the trial judge at this stage had similarly explicitly identified for the 
  jury what he considered to be the permitted use of the evidence of Pollock's 
  violent disposition and use of violence. That said, the trial judge had earlier 
  identified for the jury the proper use of the testimony concerning the assaults 
  by Pollock, such as when he dealt with the evidence of Teresa Jones, for example.</p>
<p>
  3. Pollock's other grounds of appeal</p>
<p>
  [143] In light of my conclusion concerning the fairness of the trial, I intend 
  to deal with Pollock's other grounds of appeal somewhat briefly.</p>
<p>
  (a) Severance</p>
<p>
  [144] Pollock submits that the trial judge erred in failing to sever his trial 
  from Morrisson's. At trial, counsel for Pollock made several applications for 
  severance at various stages of the proceedings, usually in response to cross-examination 
  by Morrisson's counsel that adduced propensity evidence or inadmissible evidence. 
  I would not interfere with the trial judge's discretion in refusing to grant 
  severance. The allegation in this case was that Pollock and Morrisson were engaged 
  in a joint venture. This was presumptively a case for a joint trial. The Supreme 
  Court of Canada has held that there should be a joint trial even where the defence 
  of one accused includes an attack on the character of a co-accused. See R. v. 
  Crawford at paras. 30-32. Also see R. v. Suzack at paras. 87-108.</p>
<p>
  [145] The problem in this case was not the trial judge's decision refusing severance 
  but the introduction of inadmissible evidence and improper cross-examination 
  by Morrisson's counsel. The remedy for the problem was not severance but an 
  order excluding the evidence and requiring counsel to comply with the rules 
  of evidence.</p>
<p>
  [146] Pollock submits that the rule that denies full appellate review of a trial 
  judge's decision refusing severance violates ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter 
  of Rights and Freedoms. This submission is based on the well-established principle 
  that an appellate court will not interfere with a discretionary decision unless 
  the trial judge "acted unjudicially or &#133; the ruling resulted in an 
  injustice". See R. v. Litchfield (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at 
  p. 114. Pollock's submission is that, as a matter of fundamental justice, an 
  accused is entitled to full appellate review of any trial decision affecting 
  his or her liberty. </p>
<p>
  [147] As Doherty J.A. said in R. v. Suzack at para. 40, "legislation conferring 
  a discretion may not be interpreted so as to permit the exercise of that discretion 
  in a manner which infringes Charter rights". In exercising his discretion 
  whether or not to grant severance in this case, the trial judge was required 
  to consider whether the ends of justice required severance. That required the 
  balancing of a number of competing interests as explained in cases such as Crawford 
  and Suzack, including the importance of avoiding an injustice to the accused, 
  as explained in R. v. Crawford at para. 32: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The general rule, therefore, is that the respective rights of the co-accused 
  must be resolved on the basis that the trial will be a joint trial. This does 
  not mean, however, that the trial judge has been stripped of his discretion 
  to sever. That discretion remains, and can be exercised if it appears that the 
  attempt to reconcile the respective rights of the co-accused results in an injustice 
  to one of the accused.</p>
<p>
  [148] The limitation on the scope of appellate review of this decision recognizes 
  that the trial judge is in a preferred position in balancing the many, and often 
  competing, interests. The principle of deference to discretionary decisions 
  is also inherent in the hierarchical nature of our justice system. This principle 
  has been recognized time and again by the Supreme Court of Canada in a myriad 
  of different contexts. Appellate courts retain adequate powers to intervene 
  not only if the trial judge has erred in law or in principle but also if the 
  refusal to grant severance has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Pollock 
  has not identified any constitutional principle that casts doubt on the validity 
  of the standard of appellate review. I would not give effect to this ground 
  of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (b) Comment on failure of Pollock to testify</p>
<p>
  [149] In his closing submissions, counsel for Morrisson commented on several 
  occasions that Morrisson, unlike Pollock, had testified notwithstanding the 
  substantial body of evidence against him. Morrisson's counsel was entitled to 
  make this comment. See R. v. Naglick (1991), 65 C.C.C. (3d) 272 (Ont. C.A.) 
  reversed on other grounds (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 526 (S.C.C.). Pollock submits, 
  however, that the trial judge should have directed the jury that Pollock's failure 
  to testify could not be considered as evidence of guilt. The trial judge did 
  instruct the jury that, "[t]he law gives all accused persons the right 
  to remain silent at all times, even when confronted with allegations of wrongdoing." 
  In context, the jury would probably take this instruction as a comment on pre-trial 
  silence. The trial judge did not instruct the jury that it could not use Pollock's 
  failure to testify as evidence of guilt.</p>
<p>
  [150] Pollock submits that failure to give the instruction violates the right 
  against self-incrimination as a principle of fundamental justice in s. 7 of 
  the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and also has the effect of shifting the burden 
  of proof contrary to the presumption of innocence as guaranteed by s. 11(d) 
  of the Charter. Pollock concedes that the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in R. v. Noble (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 385 is against this submission. In that 
  case, Sopinka J. speaking for a majority of the court at paragraphs 95 and 96 
  held that s. 4(6) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5, prohibits 
  a trial judge from commenting on the silence of the accused and, in particular, 
  "from instructing the jury on the impermissibility of using silence to 
  take the case against the accused to one that proves guilt beyond a reasonable 
  doubt". Section 4(6) provides as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The failure of the person charged, or of the wife or husband of that person, 
  to testify shall not be made the subject of comment by the judge or by counsel 
  for the prosecution.</p>
<p>
  [151] Pollock attempts to avoid the impact of the decision in Noble by pointing 
  out that the constitutionality of s. 4(6) was not challenged in that case. He 
  submits that s. 4(6) should either be interpreted in a manner consistent with 
  the Charter or it should be held to be of no force and effect. This issue was 
  not raised at trial and no objection was taken to the charge to the jury on 
  this basis. This is not a proper case to permit a Charter issue to be raised 
  for the first time on appeal. Had the issue been raised at trial, the Crown 
  would have had the opportunity to make submissions and the trial judge could 
  have considered whether to grant Pollock some remedy.</p>
<p>
  (c) Alibi</p>
<p>
  [152] Pollock submits that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury adequately 
  as to the use to be made of Ms. Jones's evidence concerning his alibi. He submits 
  that there was no basis for a false alibi instruction and that in any event 
  the trial judge failed to direct the jury as to the distinction between a disbelieved 
  alibi and a fabricated alibi. Pollock's position respecting Ms. Jones's evidence 
  and alibi was somewhat complex. The defence position was that he was with her 
  on November 25th although he did not "raise the defence of alibi per se" 
  as the trial judge put it. The trial judge explained this position to the jury 
  and told the jury that if they believed or had a reasonable doubt that Ms. Jones's 
  evidence supported the conclusion that Pollock was elsewhere with Ms. Jones 
  at the time of the offences, then the Crown had not proven its case beyond a 
  reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [153] The trial judge also instructed the jury that Ms. Jones's testimony was 
  that while she did rent a movie as earlier instructed by Pollock, and later 
  did go to her mother's home and then to a bar, the visits to her mother's home 
  and to the bar occurred after Pollock returned home after having been out with 
  Morrisson. The trial judge also referred to the evidence that Pollock instructed 
  Jones to provide a false alibi to the police. The trial judge instructed the 
  jury that they could infer that this type of conduct was inconsistent with innocence 
  but they would have to consider whether there was an innocent explanation for 
  this after-the-fact conduct.</p>
<p>
  [154] In my view, the trial judge's directions concerning the false alibi were 
  proper. Pollock submits that there must be independent evidence of fabrication 
  before the Crown may lead evidence of a false alibi and before a false-alibi 
  instruction can be given. He relies on this court's decision in R. v. O'Connor 
  (2002), 170 C.C.C. (3d) 365. In that case at para. 30, the court held as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  When the Crown seeks to introduce evidence to show that an accused has fabricated 
  out-of-court statement, the judge should determine at that stage whether there 
  is sufficient evidence of fabrication, independent of the evidence tending to 
  show the falsity of the statements, which if accepted could reasonably support 
  a finding of fabrication. If there is not sufficient evidence to support a finding 
  of fabrication, then the Crown should not be permitted to call the evidence 
  showing the accused's statements were false. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [155] In my view, Pollock's submissions on this point misapprehend the holding 
  in O'Connor. The foundation for the discussion of false alibi in O'Connor is 
  the concern that the jury will find that an alibi has been fabricated simply 
  because the alibi is disbelieved. Therefore, the courts have "attached 
  the requirement that a finding of fabrication must be founded on evidence that 
  is independent from the evidence which contradicts or discredits the accused's 
  version of events" (para. 21). There is no requirement, however, that the 
  evidence of fabrication must itself be confirmed or independently proved. In 
  this case, there was direct evidence from Ms. Jones that Pollock attempted to 
  fabricate an alibi. He told her that if anyone asked, she was to say that she 
  had been at home and watching a movie with him that evening, and that she had 
  never met Morrisson. That evidence did not require independent confirmation 
  to constitute evidence of an attempt to fabricate an alibi and thus consciousness 
  of guilt.</p>
<p>
  [156] Further, this was not a case where the trial judge was required to instruct 
  the jury that mere disbelief of an alibi is not proof of a fabricated alibi. 
  The issue for the jury was straightforward. If they believed Ms. Jones, Pollock 
  instructed her to provide him with a false alibi. If they did not accept her 
  evidence, that was the end of it. There was no risk that the jury would somehow 
  turn disbelief of Ms. Jones's evidence into positive evidence of guilt.</p>
<p>
  (d) The Vetrovec warning</p>
<p>
  [157] The appellant submits that the trial judge did not adequately direct the 
  jury as to the danger of relying upon the evidence of Jones, Foster, A and B. 
  In my view, the direction given was adequate. A proper warning in accordance 
  with R. v. Vetrovec (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (S.C.C.) has the following four 
  elements: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) the evidence of certain witnesses is identified as requiring 
  special scrutiny;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) the characteristics of the witness that bring his or her 
  evidence into serious question are identified;</p>
<p class="indent">(3) the jury is cautioned that although it is entitled to act 
  on the unconfirmed evidence of such a witness, it is dangerous to do so; and</p>
<p class="indent">(4) the jury is cautioned to look for other independent evidence 
  which tends to confirm material parts of the evidence of the witness with respect 
  to whom the warning has been given.</p>
<p>
  [158] In this case, the trial judge gave the jury a lengthy and careful instruction 
  that, in my view, captured all of these elements. He particularly emphasized 
  "it is dangerous to rely on important testimony unless you find support 
  for it in the case of persons of unsavoury reputation". He also stated 
  that absent confirmation the jury "may well consider that little or no 
  weight should be given to such evidence". He pointed out for example that 
  several of the witnesses had perjured themselves, had significant drug problems, 
  that one of them was seeking assistance in achieving parole when she agreed 
  to testify, and that these types of witnesses will offer stories to the authorities 
  that they think the authorities want to hear to acquire benefits for themselves. 
  The warning was adequate even though the trial judge did not point to all of 
  the reasons for finding the evidence of these witnesses suspect. </p>
<p>
  [159] The trial judge identified some parts of the evidence that the jury could 
  use to confirm the testimony of the suspect witnesses. He did not exhaustively 
  review all the evidence capable of amounting to confirmation, but this was at 
  the request of Pollock's counsel. This approach is consistent with the decision 
  in R. v. Bevan (1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 310 (S.C.C.) at 326: </p>
<p class="indent"> While it is usually a corollary of the Vetrovec warning that 
  the trial judge make some reference to evidence that the jury may consider supportive 
  of the impugned evidence, in some cases part or all of the supporting evidence 
  may be extremely prejudicial to the accused, such that to draw the jury's attention 
  to that evidence in tandem with a Vetrovec warning could in some circumstances 
  be unfair to the accused.</p>
<p class="indent">I do not agree that the only remedy for this problem lies in 
  not giving a Vetrovec warning. Instead, the appropriate remedy in those circumstances 
  lies with the discretion of the trial judge to decide in the particular case 
  (perhaps following argument) if a Vetrovec warning is to be given, and, if so, 
  whether it should or should not be accompanied by a direction as to what other 
  specific evidence the jury might conclude is supportive of the impugned evidence. 
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [160] On appeal, Pollock contends that the trial judge should have exhaustively 
  defined all of the evidence capable of confirming the evidence of the suspect 
  witnesses. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. The position taken 
  by counsel for Pollock at trial was a tactical one. He obviously wished to avoid 
  the spectacle of all the confirmatory evidence being paraded before the jury. 
  This was a reasonable position to take and it was not contended that trial counsel 
  was incompetent. </p>
<p>
  [161] Pollock also submits that the trial judge erred in failing to caution 
  the jury that the evidence of one suspect witness could not confirm the evidence 
  of another suspect witness. He correctly recognizes that this court has held 
  to the contrary in R. v. Winmill (1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 380. I can see no reason 
  for reconsidering that decision. Alternatively, Pollock submits that there must 
  be an exception to the rule that one unsavoury witness can confirm another where 
  there is a danger of collusion. I am prepared to assume that where there is 
  evidence of collusion, unsavoury witnesses cannot confirm each other. In this 
  case, the trial judge, having provided the jury with examples of confirmatory 
  evidence, said this: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Confirmatory evidence does not have to be evidence which directly implicates 
  the accused. Nor does confirmatory evidence necessarily have to confirm all 
  of the evidence of a witness. Testimony which you believe in whole or in part 
  to be credible, which significantly supports the position that the inculpatory 
  aspects of the evidence of an unsavoury witness was not fabricated and which 
  is independent of the unsavoury witness, or even of other unsavoury witnesses 
  should, you may believe, have more weight in terms of your assessment of that 
  evidence. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [162] It would have been preferable for the trial judge to have gone on and 
  expressly pointed to some of the evidence from which the jury could find collusion 
  amongst the suspect witnesses, especially Foster and A. These two witnesses 
  had shared a jail cell at one time, were members of the robbery conspiracy and 
  Foster had access to A's statements concerning the ring. However, this non-direction 
  did not, in my view, occasion any prejudice to Pollock in view of the independent 
  evidence from Jones about Pollock's possession of the ring on November 25th 
  after he returned with Morrisson. Pollock also submits that there was evidence 
  of collusion between B and Jones. Jones did regularly visit B to obtain drugs 
  from him but there was little evidence of any collusion or motive for collusion 
  between the two. While the trial judge might have pointed to the evidence of 
  this relationship, in fairness he would also have had to point out that there 
  was no evidence of collusion beyond a bare possibility of opportunity. This 
  non-direction did not prejudice Pollock. I would not give effect to these grounds 
  of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (e) Warning respecting Morrisson's evidence</p>
<p>
  [163] In a somewhat related submission, Pollock submits that the trial judge 
  erred in refusing to give a Vetrovec warning in relation to Morrisson's evidence 
  insofar as it implicated Pollock in the offences. In the pre-charge conference, 
  counsel for Pollock asked for such a warning.</p>
<p>
  [164] The law is well established that a trial judge must not give a Vetrovec 
  warning in relation to defence witnesses giving evidence favourable to the defence. 
  In R. v. Tzimopoulos (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 304 (Ont. C.A.) (motion for leave 
  to appeal to Supreme Court of Canada dismissed (1987), 21 O.A.C. 319n) at 340, 
  this court held that, "[t]he Vetrovec warning should only be given where 
  a witness is giving evidence that assists in the demonstration of guilt." 
  Pollock submits that he was therefore entitled to a Vetrovec warning at least 
  in respect of that part of Morrisson's evidence implicating him in the crimes.</p>
<p>
  [165] As with so many other issues in this trial, the trial judge had to balance 
  the fair trial interests of both Morrisson and Pollock in deciding how to treat 
  Morrisson's evidence. In my view, in the circumstances of this case, to give 
  the jury a full Vetrovec warning, including a warning that it was dangerous 
  to act on Morrisson's evidence insofar as it implicated Pollock, would tip the 
  balance too far against Morrisson. The whole tenor of Morrisson's defence was 
  that Pollock, apparently acting on instructions from McLean but unbeknownst 
  to Morrisson, had executed Weston. </p>
<p>
  [166] On the other hand, Pollock was entitled to have his position fairly put 
  to the jury that Morrisson was a thoroughly unreliable witness whose evidence 
  should therefore not be relied upon. This court dealt with a similar problem 
  in R. v. Suzack. In that case, the co-accused Pennett called two witnesses whose 
  evidence supported his position that Suzack fired the shots that killed the 
  victim, a police officer. These witnesses were friends of Pennett with extensive 
  criminal records, and one had lied in court on a previous occasion. In his review 
  of the evidence of these witnesses, the trial judge told the jury to scrutinize 
  the evidence "with care before you accept it". On appeal, Pennett 
  complained that the trial judge had, in effect, given a Vetrovec warning in 
  relation to these witnesses. Doherty J.A. dealt with this ground of appeal at 
  para. 189 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I would not characterize the impugned instruction as a "Vetrovec" 
  warning but rather a caution that the credibility of these two witnesses had 
  to be carefully measured given their long history of dishonesty. A trial judge 
  is entitled to alert the jury to the factors which the trial judge thinks are 
  important in assessing the credibility of various witnesses. There was ample 
  reason to be concerned about the honesty of these two witnesses. I am sure the 
  jury would have proceeded cautiously when considering the evidence of these 
  two witnesses without any instruction from Trainor J. No doubt he felt compelled 
  to give the instruction because of Suzack's position in the trial. The evidence 
  of Gibbs and Sweeney was potentially very harmful to Suzack and it was his position 
  that they were thoroughly unworthy of belief. Trainor J. had to put Suzack's 
  position to the jury just as he had to be sure that the jury understood the 
  thrust of the evidence and its significance to Pennett's position. As at other 
  points in the charge, Trainor J. had to balance two conflicting interests. I 
  see nothing wrong with the balance he struck. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [167] The trial judge took a similar approach in this case. While not giving 
  a Vetrovec warning to the jury, he alerted the jury in clear terms to Pollock's 
  position that Morrisson's evidence should not be relied upon to support the 
  Crown's case. Thus the trial judge instructed the jury in part as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Similarly, it is part of the defence position of Mr. Pollock 
  that Mr. Morrisson has no credibility. He is a consummate liar. His involvement 
  in drugs and his association with Mr. Terry McLean, acting as Mr. McLean's right-hand 
  man, must be understood by you in Mr. Pollock's defence to assist you to appreciate 
  that it was Mr. McLean, not Mr. Pollock, who was the shooter or, at least, who 
  was present at the shooting and the events of November 25th 1993. Mr. Pollock 
  was not there, Mr. McLean was, and Mr. Morrisson was involved with Mr. McLean 
  and in drugs so deep that he has lied.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">The Crown also relies on the evidence of David Morrisson, insofar 
  as he incriminated Robert Pollock. The evidence of David Morrisson is highly 
  suspect, and also provides no meaningful confirmation of the Crown's case. The 
  Crown has not adduced credible or reliable evidence of Robert Pollock's guilt, 
  and a reasonable doubt remains.</p>
<p>
  [168] The trial judge could have gone further and instructed the jury to view 
  Morrisson's evidence with care so far as it implicated Pollock or supported 
  the Crown's case. However, I am satisfied that the jury clearly understood Pollock's 
  position. Certainly by the time Pollock's counsel had finished cross-examining 
  Morrisson on the two letters the jury could not have been in any doubt that 
  they needed to approach Morrisson's evidence with great care to the extent that 
  he tried to implicate Pollock. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (f) Cross-examination of Morrisson on failure to take a polygraph</p>
<p>
  [169] Pollock also submits that the trial judge erred in failing to permit cross-examination 
  of Morrisson on his refusal to take a polygraph. Pollock rightly points out 
  that Morrisson made his cooperation with the police a central theme of his defence. 
  Thus, Pollock submits that to provide a more accurate picture, he should have 
  been able to cross-examine Morrisson on the fact that on two occasions Morrisson 
  refused to take a polygraph test. In my view, the trial judge was right in refusing 
  to allow this cross-examination. It had minimal probative value to any issue 
  in the case and would have been extremely prejudicial to Morrisson. To explore 
  that issue fully would have involved the court in a lengthy side issue about 
  Morrisson's belief about the value of the polygraph, and might involve evidence 
  of advice Morrisson received from his counsel. There was abundant other evidence 
  to test Morrisson's assertion of his cooperation with the police, such as the 
  letters and the initial false statement, that did not carry the same prejudice.</p>
<p>
  (g) Crown counsel's jury address</p>
<p>
  [170] Pollock submits that the address of Crown counsel (not Ms. Cecchetto) 
  was improper in several respects and that this contributed to the overall unfairness 
  of the trial. Of the several complaints levelled at Crown counsel, in my view, 
  only one category merits discussion. On several occasions, Crown counsel referred 
  to the role of Crown counsel and compared his role and that of his colleague 
  to the prosecutors in a popular American television programme. I would not encourage 
  that type of comment. As this court said in R. v. Levert (2001), 159 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 71 at paras. 31 and 32: </p>
<p class="indent"> There is a danger that it invites an invidious comparison with 
  defence counsel's role. In other words, the jury may give more weight to the 
  submissions of Crown counsel because of the impression that they are objective 
  whereas the submissions of defence counsel should be discounted because they 
  are biased and driven by loyalty to the client.</p>
<p class="indent">As well, such comments come perilously close to the conduct 
  criticized by the court in Boucher v. The King (1954), 110 C.C.C. 263 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [171] That said, the trial judge instructed the jury in very clear terms to 
  ignore those comments. He also gave appropriate instructions with respect to 
  many of the complaints taken in this court about Crown counsel's closing address. 
  The nature of Crown counsel's comments were not such as to affect the overall 
  fairness of the trial and I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  (h) Approach to the evidence </p>
<p>
  [172] Pollock's final ground of appeal from conviction concerns the manner in 
  which the trial judge directed the jury with respect to their fact finding. 
  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in the following passages from 
  the charge to the jury: </p>
<p class="indent"> Go through all of the evidence in relation to each accused 
  considered separately and independently. Look at it, decide what you accept, 
  what you believe, and what you do not accept. Then take the law as I will explain 
  it to you, and decide whether or not the evidence which you accept proves the 
  vital essential elements of the offence, or a lesser included offence, and whether 
  that evidence proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="indent">If on looking at all of the evidence whether favourable to the 
  prosecution or defence, you are left with a reasonable doubt on any vital or 
  essential element of an offence, then the Crown has not proved that that offence 
  has been committed.</p>
<p class="indent">Do not, however, go through the evidence by way of a series 
  of separate and exclusive judgments on separate items of evidence or groups 
  of evidence. Do not take a piece of evidence and ask what this proves in and 
  of itself. As stated so many times, look at the whole of the evidence in relation 
  to each accused. If you believe some one or more aspects of the evidence beyond 
  a reasonable doubt, but have such a doubt when assessing all of the evidence, 
  you must acquit the accused in respect of whom you have such a doubt on that 
  offence. You must assess each accused and each offence in this way.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">You must determine the guilt or innocence of Mr. Morrisson and 
  Mr. Pollock on the evidence that you do, in fact, believe referable to that 
  particular accused. In short, you should be scrupulous about weighing the evidence 
  of Miss Jones and Messrs. [A], Foster and [B]; however, having done so and considered 
  the dangers of convicting on the strength of such evidence, especially if it 
  is unconfirmed, I tell you again that you may accept some, none or all of that 
  evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">The evidence that you do accept can then serve as a basis of 
  proof of other evidence and thus in the context of your considerations of the 
  whole of the evidence. Such evidence can be a basis for your verdict in relation 
  to each of Mr. Morrisson and Mr. Pollock, each considered separately and independently. 
</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Members of the jury, you are not only entitled to but you are 
  obliged to consider all of the evidence to determine whether the focus of the 
  police investigation was properly conducted in order to fairly evaluate the 
  information which the police had.</p>
<p class="indent">Indeed, you must do so. Do not permit yourself to be unduly 
  influenced by words such as "conspiracy" or "frame". Your job is to weigh the 
  evidence you have heard or seen in this trial. All of it. Your obligation is 
  to search to determine the facts as you believe them to be, based upon the evidence 
  called in this trial, and then to apply those facts to the law as I have explained 
  it to you. This is the only basis upon which you can reach a fair and just verdict 
  in a fair trial. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [173] The appellant submits that these directions are inconsistent with this 
  court's decision in R. v. Miller (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 517 at 543: </p>
<p class="indent"> [I]t was a misdirection to instruct the jury to examine the 
  evidence in a first stage, to eliminate all evidence except that which the jurors 
  accepted as true and reliable (a lower standard than proof beyond a reasonable 
  doubt), and then to consider only the residual in arriving at their verdict. 
  This involved the injection of artificial rules for the jury and constituted 
  "an intrusion into the province of the jury". We believe it is wrong and prejudicial 
  to confine the jury, in their initial findings of fact, to evidence accepted 
  as true and reliable; evidence which is neither rejected nor accepted should 
  survive to the final stage of the jury's determination on the crucial application 
  of reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="indent">In a case where credibility is vital, the jury should be told 
  clearly what to do in the event of a reasonable doubt about credibility. Here, 
  the jury was invited to proceed to their findings of fact on the basis of evidence 
  accepted as true and reliable, and to exclude from their consideration evidence 
  which they rejected. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p> [174] I agree with Pollock that these directions read in isolation are problematic, 
  particularly the direction that the jury should determine the guilt "or innocence" 
  of both appellants "on the evidence that you do, in fact, believe referable 
  to that particular accused". In my view, however, these directions were not 
  fatal when the other directions to the jury are taken into account, especially 
  the trial judge's references to the need for the jury to consider all of the 
  evidence relating to a particular accused. In Miller at p. 544, the court found 
  that the proper instructions on reasonable doubt and the presumption of innocence 
  "cannot correct or neutralize a colourful but erroneous specific direction on 
  the two-stage process which would strike the imagination of the jury".<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
  The trial judge in this case did not accompany the impugned directions with 
  a similar metaphor.</p>
<p>
  (i) The role of counsel</p>
<p>
  [175] I wish to conclude my discussion of Pollock's appeal with a comment about 
  the role of defence counsel in a joint trial. Of course, counsel have an obligation 
  to advance the cause of their client fearlessly by all lawful means. That obligation 
  does not change because counsel is required to adduce evidence in a joint trial 
  that will prejudice or undermine the defence of a co-accused. Accused do not 
  choose to be tried together. That is a matter first for the Crown, and then 
  for the trial judge when considering any severance application. Counsel do, 
  however, have an obligation to respect the rules of evidence, to act fairly 
  in representing their client, and to respect the rulings of the trial judge. 
  Regrettably, in this case counsel for Morrisson in his defence of his client 
  frequently crossed the line between legitimate defence and improper tactics. 
  It began when he cross-examined A on the threat. Even if this evidence was admissible, 
  he had to know that its admissibility would be contested. After all, he had 
  sat through a lengthy voir dire where the Crown had attempted, unsuccessfully, 
  to lead the very same evidence. In fairness to everyone, he should have raised 
  the issue with the judge before attempting to lead the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [176] After that incident, the trial judge warned counsel to vet such controversial 
  matters with the court first. Despite that warning, counsel for Morrisson continued 
  to ask questions calling for prejudicial evidence without advising the trial 
  judge. He also asked questions calling for inadmissible hearsay evidence. Often, 
  the damage was done by the question. The fact that the trial judge later ruled 
  that the question should not be answered could not, in the circumstances of 
  this case, repair the damage. </p>
<p>
  [177] In R. v. Giesecke (1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 331 (Ont. C.A.), application 
  for leave to appeal to Supreme Court of Canada dismissed (1994), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 
  vii, at 334 this court encountered a similar problem, in that case because of 
  the jury address of counsel for the co-accused. In that context the court noted 
  that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [w]hile counsel is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her address 
  to the jury, there is a significant difference between remarks or observations 
  one can characterize as inappropriate but contextually acceptable, and those 
  made by counsel for the co-accused in this case which, by their hyperbole, mischaracterization 
  or insinuation, impair the possibility of a fair trial. </p>
<p>
  [178] The same must be said here. While counsel is not held to a standard of 
  perfection in their defence of the case and allowances must be made for the 
  stress of defending a client on a charge of first degree murder, counsel must 
  not resort to improper tactics that impair the possibility of a fair trial.</p>
<p>
  THE MORRISSON APPEAL</p>
<p>
  1. The "letters" to Pollock</p>
<p>
  [179] The appellant Morrisson's principal ground of appeal concerns the admissibility 
  and use of Exhibits 91 and 92, the letters that Morrisson apparently wrote to 
  Pollock. With respect to admissibility, Morrisson submits that the trial judge 
  failed to consider whether the probative value of the letters outweighed their 
  prejudicial effect. He submits that the letters were of virtually no benefit 
  to Pollock. On the other hand, the letters were extremely prejudicial to Morrisson. 
  They tended to undermine his claim that he was afraid of Pollock, and could 
  be read as an admission and as consciousness of guilt. </p>
<p>
  [180] In my view, the letters were properly admitted. They were statements by 
  Morrisson concerning the crimes. I do not accept that they were of no benefit 
  to Pollock. Morrisson directly implicated Pollock in the murder and attempted 
  murder. It was Pollock's position that Morrisson was not telling the truth and 
  was covering up for McLean. It was his position that it was not out of fear 
  Morrisson did not identify Pollock in his initial statement to the police, but 
  rather because Pollock had not been there. The letters seriously undermined 
  Morrisson's credibility, especially his claim that he lied to the police out 
  of fear of Pollock.</p>
<p>
  [181] Morrisson also submits that the trial judge should have determined whether 
  or not these were letters sent to Pollock or merely notes Morrisson kept for 
  himself. In my view, it was not necessary for the trial judge to make any such 
  determination. Once it was shown that the documents were written by Morrisson, 
  and he accepted that they were, they were admissions by Morrisson and available 
  for use by the jury as such. Morrisson's purpose in creating the documents was 
  a matter for the jury to consider.</p>
<p>
  [182] I am also satisfied that the trial judge adequately directed the jury 
  as to the use to be made of the letters. The trial judge directed the jury that 
  they could use the letters in assessing Morrisson's credibility and "whether 
  or not they [the letters] are consistent with the conduct of an innocent person". 
  The trial judge then went on to give a complete instruction to the jury about 
  the use of after-the-fact conduct evidence.</p>
<p>
  2. Severance</p>
<p>
  [183] Morrisson also submits that the trial judge erred in refusing his application 
  for severance. Morrisson applied for severance when the trial judge permitted 
  Ms. Jones to testify about Pollock's comment that "Dave didn't do what 
  he was supposed to do. Dave fucked up." As I have said above, the decision 
  whether to order severance is discretionary. I am not persuaded that the trial 
  judge erred in refusing the severance application. This was a proper case for 
  a joint trial and the trial judge gave the jury clear instructions at the time 
  the evidence was introduced that this evidence was not admissible against Morrisson. 
  As well, in the charge to the jury, the trial judge instructed the jury that 
  the statements were only evidence against Pollock and "cannot be used by 
  you in deciding the guilt or innocence of Mr. Morrisson. They are not evidence 
  insofar as Mr. Morrisson is concerned." Finally, the statements were not 
  so gravely prejudicial to Morrisson's defence that no instruction could minimize 
  the risk that the jury would misuse the evidence. While somewhat incriminating, 
  the statements also were consistent with Morrisson's position that he did nothing 
  to assist in the killings.</p>
<p>
  3. Use of the evidence of Pollock's disposition for violence</p>
<p>
  [184] Morrisson also submits that the trial judge did not adequately direct 
  the jury as to the use to be made of the evidence concerning Pollock's disposition 
  for violence. The trial judge directed the jury that this evidence was relevant 
  to Morrisson's position that he gave the false statement to the police out of 
  fear of Pollock. On appeal, Morrisson submits that the evidence was also relevant 
  to show that Pollock was more likely than Morrisson to have administered the 
  beating to Weston and to have acted alone, and the jury should have been so 
  instructed. No objection was taken at trial to this aspect of the charge to 
  the jury. </p>
<p>
  [185] In any event, in my view, Morrisson was not prejudiced by the absence 
  of the proposed direction. As I have said earlier, this is not a case where 
  there was some doubt about the role played by the gunman. If Pollock was at 
  the scene of the crime, there was no doubt that he shot Smith and Weston and 
  beat Weston, probably with the gun. Evidence of Pollock's propensity for violence 
  was not admissible in favour of the Crown to place Pollock at the scene. The 
  propensity evidence could only be used to support Morrisson's theory if the 
  jury could infer that Pollock's propensity for violence made it unlikely that 
  Morrisson joined in the beating. I fail to see how this evidence would have 
  materially assisted the jury in drawing the desired inference. I would not give 
  effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  4. The effect of allowing Pollock's appeal</p>
<p>
  [186] Although not raised by Morrisson, I have considered the effect of what 
  appears to be the possibly anomalous result that on one theory of the case the 
  person alleged to be the principal offender is entitled to a new trial while 
  the co-accused is not so entitled. However, I am satisfied that dismissing Morrisson's 
  appeal is the correct result. This is not a case such as R. v. Nygaard (1989), 
  51 C.C.C. (3d) 417 (S.C.C.) where, while the inadmissible evidence affected 
  only the principal offender, the court ordered a new trial for both because 
  it was possible that on a new trial the principal offender would be convicted 
  only of second degree murder. That would have led to "the incongruous and 
  unacceptable result" (p. 440) that the prime mover in the case was guilty 
  of only second degree murder while the other party was guilty of first degree 
  murder. </p>
<p>
  [187] In this case, the trial judge did leave second degree murder as a possible 
  verdict, although realistically Pollock was guilty of first degree murder or 
  nothing at all. This was nothing less than an execution. Without warning and 
  after lying in wait, the gunman shot Smith and Weston. Further, this is not 
  a case where the "prime mover" could end up convicted of a lesser 
  offence. The most likely theory was that Morrisson and the gunman were co-perpetrators, 
  not that Morrisson was merely a party to a killing by the gunman. </p>
<p>
  [188] Accordingly, I would dismiss Morrisson's appeal from conviction.</p>
<p>
  THE SENTENCE APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [189] The trial judge sentenced both Morrisson and Pollock to life imprisonment 
  with "no parole eligibility" on the charge of first-degree murder. 
  He sentenced them for the attempted murder charge to life imprisonment and "no 
  parole eligibility for 15 years". The mandatory minimum sentence for first 
  degree murder is life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 25 years. 
  See Criminal Code, s. 745(a). I expect that this is what the trial judge intended. 
  However, for the sake of clarity I would adjust the sentence to conform with 
  the wording of s. 745(a). </p>
<p>
  [190] The maximum sentence for attempted murder is life imprisonment. The trial 
  judge also has the discretion to impose a period of parole ineligibility. The 
  maximum period, however, is ten years. See Criminal Code s. 743.6(1). The sentence 
  must be adjusted accordingly. It was not suggested that the sentence of life 
  imprisonment was unfit.</p>

<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [191] Accordingly, I would allow Pollock's appeal from conviction, set aside 
  the convictions and order a new trial. I would dismiss Morrisson's appeal from 
  conviction. I would grant leave to Morrisson to appeal the sentence for attempted 
  murder, allow the appeal and reduce the period of parole eligibility to ten 
  years. The sentence of life imprisonment will stand. The sentence for first-degree 
  murder is life imprisonment without eligibility for parole until Morrisson has 
  served twenty-five years of the sentence.</p>
