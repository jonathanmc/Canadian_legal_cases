<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant raises three grounds of appeal against conviction. </p>
<p>The Bell Telephone Records</p>
<p>[2] The trial judge refused to allow the appellant to adduce the telephone 
  records on the basis of the timing of the application and the appellant's failure 
  to give proper notice. In our view, given the limited probative value of the 
  records, it was open to the trial judge to exercise his discretion in the manner 
  he did. The records would not have been available until the Crown had completed 
  its examination of the complainant. In any event, the complainant admitted in 
  cross-examination that she had accepted many more calls from the appellant than 
  what she had told the police or testified to in-chief. Accordingly, the defence 
  succeeded in establishing what the records would have shown had they been admitted. 
  It follows that the appellant suffered no prejudice.</p>
<p>The s. 276 Issue</p>
<p>[3] The appellant applied to cross-examine the complainant with a view to establishing 
  that he and the complainant had slept together in the same bed on the night 
  of June 3rd and that they had kissed the next morning when he left her premises. 
  The trial judge held that the proposed questioning raised an inference of sexual 
  activity and thus required an application under s. 276 of the Criminal Code. 
  We agree. </p>
<p>[4] The trial judge refused to permit the proposed questioning. In so concluding, 
  he considered the timing of the request, the appellant's failure to comply with 
  the notice requirements of s. 276 and his further failure to provide detailed 
  particulars of the evidence he was seeking to adduce. He also took into account 
  the limited probative value of the impugned evidence, bearing in mind the appellant's 
  contention that it was solely designed to show that he and the complainant had 
  slept together in the same bed without engaging in any sexual activity. In that 
  regard, as the trial judge noted, the jury was already aware from the complainant's 
  evidence that although she had broken off her relationship with the appellant 
  two weeks prior to June 5th, she was nonetheless allowing him to stay at her 
  residence until he got back on his feet. The jury also knew that the appellant 
  had slept over at the complainant's residence on the night of June 3rd and that 
  he and the complainant had parted on friendly terms the next morning. Accordingly, 
  the trial judge was on solid ground in holding that the evidence had little 
  probative value.</p>
<p>[5] As for the prejudicial effect of the proposed evidence, there was a real 
  concern that it would leave the jury, by design or implication, with the erroneous 
  impression that the appellant and the complainant had engaged in sexual activity 
  on the night of June 3rd. In that sense, its prejudicial effect clearly outweighed 
  its probative value.</p>
<p>[6] In the circumstances, we are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in 
  refusing to permit the proposed questions.</p>
<p>The Failure to Provide a Vetrovec Warning with Respect to the Complainant and 
  Failure to Review the Frailties in the Complainant's Evidence.</p>
<p>[7] We are not persuaded that a Vetrovec warning was required in this case. 
  Apart from a number of inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence, which 
  the trial judge reviewed with the jury, there is no reason for doubting her 
  integrity or the trustworthiness of her evidence. In these circumstances, while 
  it would have been open to the trial judge to provide the jury with a cautionary 
  instruction, such an instruction was not mandatory.</p>
<p>[8] In any event, the appellant did not seek a Vetrovec warning, probably for 
  tactical reasons. Had the trial judge warned the jury as the appellant now suggests 
  he should have, he would also have had to alert the jury to the large body of 
  evidence capable of confirming the complainant's testimony. Such an instruction 
  would not have enured to the appellant's benefit.</p>
<p>[9] Additionally, the jury was very discerning in its verdicts. The appellant 
  was acquitted on most of the counts that depended on the unconfirmed evidence 
  of the complainant. The convictions related largely to those counts upon which 
  the complainant's evidence was confirmed. In these circumstances, had a Vetrovec 
  warning been given, the outcome, in our view, would have been the same. </p>
<p>[10] As for the concern that the trial judge did not sufficiently alert the 
  jury to the frailties in the appellant's evidence, we are satisfied that the 
  charge adequately conveyed the relevant features of the complainant's evidence, 
  including the appellant's position regarding its frailties.</p>
<p>[11] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
