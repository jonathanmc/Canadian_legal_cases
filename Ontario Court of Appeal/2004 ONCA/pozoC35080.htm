<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We need to address only one of the grounds of appeal raised by the appellant.
  That is the ground relating to the interventions made by the trial judge during
  the course of the trial. Crown counsel acknowledges, and we entirely agree,
  that the interventions by the trial judge were numerous and on many occasions,
  discourteous. We are satisfied that they go further than that and are such
  that a reasonably minded person who was present throughout the the trial could
  conclude that the appellant did not receive a fair trial: R. v. Valley (1986),
  26 C.C.C. (3d) 297 (Ont. C.A.). 
<p>[2] The interventions by the trial judge during
  cross-examination of the police officers by counsel for the appellant considered
  in their entirety undermined the integrity of counsel and suggested that he
  was less than competent. The interventions also interfered with counsel&rsquo;s
  ability to fully and effectively pursue legitimate lines of cross-examination.
  The effect of these interventions on the appearance of the fairness of the
  trial was particularly significant given the nature of the defence advanced
  and the nature  of the cross-examination necessitated by that defence.
  Counsel conceded before the jury that his client was involved in criminal activity,
  but not the criminal activity charged in the indictment, and at the same time
  directly challenged the honesty of the police officers. This was a difficult,
  but proper position to advance before the jury. In these circumstances, it
  was particularly important that the trial judge not denigrate the integrity
  of counsel or the good faith with which the defence was being advanced by counsel.
  <p>[3] The appeal is allowed, the verdict is set aside and a new trial is ordered.
