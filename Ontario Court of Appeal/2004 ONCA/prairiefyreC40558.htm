<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Paul F. Lalonde of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated July 31, 2003.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  SIMMONS J.A.: </p>
<p> [1] The issues on this appeal[<a href="#a">1]</a><a name="1"></a> concern 
  an insurer's duty to defend an action commenced against its insured. The application 
  judge dismissed the insured's application for a declaration that its insurer 
  has a duty to defend under an advertising injury coverage clause contained in 
  an insurance policy. For somewhat different reasons than those given by the 
  application judge, I agree that, in the circumstances of this case, the insurer 
  does not have a duty to defend. I would therefore dismiss the insured's appeal.</p>
<p>
  I. Background </p>
<p>
  a) the insured and the insurance policy</p>
<p>
  [2] PrairieFyre Software Inc. ("prairieFyre") carries on business 
  as a developer and vendor of call centre management software products. Clarke 
  LaPrairie is the Chief Executive Officer of prairieFyre. In November 1998, St. 
  Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. ("St. Paul") issued a commercial 
  general liability insurance policy to prairieFyre (the "1998 policy"). 
  Subsequently, St. Paul issued renewal policies to prairieFyre in November 1999 
  (the "1999 policy") and November 2000 (the "2000 policy").</p>
<p> [3] The 1998 policy[<a href="#a">2]</a><a name="2"></a> includes coverage 
  for advertising injury and extends to the officers and directors of the insured 
  corporation. The insuring agreement in this policy provides that the insurance 
  applies to advertising injury "only if caused by an offence during the 'policy 
  period'" [emphasis added]. Moreover, the coverage clause restricts coverage 
  for advertising injury to "injury ... caused by an offence ... committed in 
  the course of advertising the Insured's goods, products or services" [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [4] Four provisions of the 1998 policy are important for the purpose of this 
  appeal. Paragraph 1 of the policy is the insuring agreement, which sets out 
  the advertising injury coverage: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1. INSURING AGREEMENTS</p>
<p>
  Coverage B - Personal Injury and Advertising Injury Liability</p>
<p>
  To pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally 
  obligated to pay as damages because of ... "advertising injury" to 
  which this insurance applies. This insurance applies to ... "advertising 
  injury" only if caused by an offence during the "policy period" 
  committed in the course of advertising the Insurer's goods, products or services 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [5] Paragraph 2 of the policy defines the scope of the duty to defend: </p>
<p class="indent"> 2. DEFENCE - SETTLEMENT - SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS</p>
<p class="indent">As respects insurance afforded by this Part, the Insurer shall: 
</p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) defend in the name and on behalf of the Insured and at the costs of the 
  Insurer any civil action which may at any time be brought against the Insured 
  on account of such ... "advertising injury"... but the Insurer shall 
  have the right to make such investigation, negotiation and settlement of any 
  claim as may be deemed expedient by the Insurer;</p>
<p>
  [6] Paragraph 5 of the policy sets out the policy exclusions: </p>
<p class="indent"> 5. EXCLUSIONS</p>
<p class="indent">This insurance does not apply to: </p>
<p class="indent">
  P. "advertising injury" arising out of: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) breach of contract, other than misrepresentation of advertising ideas under 
  an implied contract, &#133; [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [7] Paragraph 7 of the policy sets out the definition of advertising injury: </p>
<p class="indent"> 7. DEFINITIONS</p>
<p class="indent">A. "Advertising injury" means injury arising out of one or more 
  of the following offences: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) oral or written publication of material that slanders or 
  libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization's goods, 
  products or services,</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) oral or written publication of material that violates a 
  person's right of privacy,</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing 
  business, or</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) infringement of copyright, title or slogan. </p>
<p>
  b) Taske Technology Inc.'s actions against prairieFyre</p>
<p>
  [8] This appeal relates to an action commenced against prairieFyre and Mr. LaPrairie 
  by Taske Technology Inc. ("Taske") on June 29, 2001 (the "June 
  29, 2001 action"). On July 21, 2000, prior to commencing the June 29, 2001 
  action, Taske issued a statement of claim against prairieFyre and Mr. LaPrairie, 
  claiming damages for libel, breach of trademark and breach of copyright (the 
  "July 21, 2000 action"). The July 21, 2000 action focused on the contents 
  of a sales brochure that Taske alleged was prepared and disseminated by prairieFyre 
  and Mr. LaPrairie in June 2000. On being notified of the July 21, 2000 action, 
  St. Paul undertook the defence. After the June 29, 2001 action was commenced, 
  St. Paul settled the July 21, 2000 action.</p>
<p>
  [9] In the action forming the subject matter of this appeal (the June 29, 2001 
  action), Taske claims compensatory damages against prairieFyre and Mr. LaPrairie 
  for infringement of copyright, breach of contract, breach of confidence, breach 
  of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and misappropriation of business opportunities. 
  In particular, Taske alleges that Mr. LaPrairie was formerly associated with 
  Taske, and that he worked with Dennis Johns, the founder of Taske, to develop 
  a distinctive call centre management software product known as Taske ACD Toolbox. 
  </p>
<p>
  [10] In August 1998, Mr. LaPrairie triggered the shotgun clause in a shareholder 
  agreement and named a price for the purchase of Mr. Johns' interest in Taske. 
  Mr. Johns reversed the shotgun and purchased Mr. LaPrairie's interest. As part 
  of completing the sale, Mr. LaPrairie signed a Release Agreement dated October 
  5, 1998, in which he acknowledged that Taske was the owner of all proprietary 
  rights developed by Mr. LaPrairie or his holding company in relation to Taske. 
  </p>
<p>
  [11] Taske claims that, following the sale of his interest, Mr. LaPrairie and 
  prairieFyre began developing, and eventually selling, a competing call centre 
  management software product incorporating Taske's proprietary technology, thereby 
  infringing Taske's copyright, breaching various duties owed to Taske, and breaching 
  the Release Agreement. </p>
<p>
  [12] PrairieFyre and Mr. LaPrairie rely on several specific paragraphs in Taske's 
  statement of claim as alleging advertising injury and as triggering their claim 
  for advertising injury coverage. Paragraph 48 of Taske's statement of claim 
  illustrates the basis of their position: </p>
<p class="indent">
  48. The Defendants, with full knowledge of the exclusive copyrights of the Plaintiffs 
  in the Taske ACD Toolbox software, and without consent of the Plaintiffs, have 
  distributed, exposed, offered for sale, and exhibited in public by way of trade, 
  unauthorized copies of the Taske ACD Toolbox software, or substantial parts 
  thereof, within the prairieFyre software product.</p>
<p>
  c) the application judge's reasons</p>
<p>
  [13] By letter dated July 17, 2001, St. Paul denied coverage for claims made 
  in the June 29, 2001 action. PrairieFyre and Mr. LaPrairie then applied for 
  a declaration that the advertising injury coverage applies and that St. Paul 
  has a duty to defend. The application judge dismissed their application. In 
  doing so, he noted that, at this stage, the sole issue for determination was 
  whether St. Paul had a duty under the policy to defend the claim initiated against 
  its insured by Taske. He focused on determining whether Taske's allegations 
  of copyright infringement fall within the wording of the advertising injury 
  coverage as set out in the November 1998 policy and cautioned himself not to 
  go behind the pleadings to determine the authenticity of Taske's claims. </p>
<p>
  [14] The application judge noted that "advertising" is not a defined 
  term in the policy. He found that Taske's allegations amount to a claim that 
  the appellants had "targeted their new software towards a sophisticated 
  audience for the purpose of bringing their product out into the open" and 
  therefore fall within the rubric of "advertising activity". Further, 
  he found that there was a sufficient connection between the allegations of copyright 
  infringement and the allegations of advertising activity to trigger St. Paul's 
  duty to defend. He said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  As long as there is some connection or requisite nexus between the injury and 
  the infringement, this is sufficient -Amos v. Insurance [1995], 3 S.C.R. 405 
  at 417. Otherwise, if no connection needs to be established then just about 
  everything would be covered under a policy. A direct nexus need not be established 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [15] Despite these findings, the application judge held that St. Paul did not 
  have a duty to defend because the exclusion clause in paragraph 5(P)(i) applied. 
  He concluded that the advertising injury arose from a breach of the Release 
  Agreement and therefore fell within the breach of contract exclusion contained 
  in the 1998 policy.</p>
<p>
  d) the positions of the parties</p>
<p> [16] The parties raised several issues on appeal. The appellants' main submission 
  was that the application judge erred in holding that the exclusion clause relating 
  to breach of contract applied to Taske's claims. They also asserted that the 
  defined offence of "misappropriation of style of doing business", defined under 
  the 1998 policy as "advertising injury", should be considered in assessing Taske's 
  claims and the duty to defend[<a href="#a">3]</a><a name="3"></a>; that the 
  statement of claim issued in the July 21, 2000 action should inform the interpretation 
  of the statement of claim issued in the June 29, 2001 action; and that the application 
  judge should have decided the coverage issue based on the language of the 2000 
  policy. Finally, the appellants sought to introduce a fresh as amended statement 
  of claim delivered after the application judge's decision as fresh evidence 
  on the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [17] By way of cross-appeal, the respondent submitted that the application judge 
  erred in two respects: first, in concluding that Taske's statement of claim 
  alleged advertising activity by the appellants; and second, in holding that 
  Taske alleged a causal link between the appellants' advertising activity and 
  its injuries sufficient to trigger a potential claim for advertising injury 
  coverage and a duty to defend.</p>
<p>
  II. Analysis</p>
<p>
  [18] In my view, the respondent's second submission is dispositive of this appeal. 
  </p>
<p>
  [19] Assuming, without deciding, that the allegations made by Taske in the June 
  29, 2001 action fall within the ambit of "advertising activity", I 
  conclude that the application judge erred in holding that there was a sufficient 
  connection between Taske's allegations of advertising activity and copyright 
  infringement (and, on appeal, misappropriation of style of doing business) to 
  trigger St. Paul's duty to defend. </p>
<p>
  [20] Contrary to the application judge's finding that it is unnecessary to find 
  a " direct nexus" between Taske's allegations of advertising activity 
  and its alleged injuries in order to trigger a duty to defend, the coverage 
  clause in the 1998 policy stipulates that advertising injury coverage applies 
  only to "injury &#133; caused by an offence &#133; committed in the course 
  of advertising." Accordingly, the policy specifically requires a direct 
  causal link between advertising activity and "an offence" as a condition 
  of coverage. The "offences" for which advertising injury coverage 
  is available are set out in the definitions section of the 1998 policy. For 
  ease of reference, parts of the coverage clause and the definitions section 
  are repeated below: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. INSURING AGREEMENTS</p>
<p class="indent">This insurance applies to &#133; "advertising injury" only if 
  caused by an offence during the "policy period" committed in the course of advertising 
  the Insured's goods, products or services [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">7. Definitions</p>
<p class="indent">A. "Advertising injury" means injury arising out of one or more 
  of the following offences: </p>
<p class="indent"> &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) misappropriation of advertising ideas or style of doing 
  business, or</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) infringement of copyright, title or slogan.</p>
<p>[21] Unlike the July 21, 2000 action, which dealt with the contents of alleged 
  defamatory statements in a sales brochure and therefore related directly to 
  advertising, the June 29, 2001 action focuses on prairieFyre's alleged misuse 
  of confidential and proprietary information in the development and sale of its 
  software. Taske's allegation that praireFyre and Mr. LaPrairie "exhibited 
  in public by way of trade, unauthorized copies of the Taske ACD Toolbox software, 
  or substantial parts thereof, within the praireFyre software product" falls 
  short of asserting that the appellants actually displayed any portion of Taske's 
  product as a form of advertising. On a generous reading, Taske's statement of 
  claim fails to make any allegation of copyright infringement or misappropriation 
  of style of doing business committed in the course of advertising.</p>
<p>
  [22] I reject the appellants' submission that Taske's July 21, 2000 statement 
  of claim should somehow inform the interpretation of Taske's June 29, 2001 statement 
  of claim. Taske discontinued the action commenced by its July 21, 2000 statement 
  of claim after issuing its June 29, 2001 statement of claim, and it has not 
  amended the latter pleading to include the allegations contained in its July 
  21, 2000 statement of claim. However, even if I accepted the appellants' submission, 
  it remains my view that the June 29, 2001 statement of claim fails to make any 
  allegation of copyright infringement or misappropriation of style of doing business 
  committed in the course of advertising. </p>
<p>
  [23] As for the question of which policy applies, I agree with St. Paul's submission 
  that Taske's allegations appear to relate to a timeframe soon after October 
  1998. Accordingly, the 1998 policy is clearly applicable. However, even if Taske's 
  allegations relate to continuing conduct, in my view, the language of the 2000 
  policy does not assist the appellants on the issue of causation. The 2000 policy 
  provides as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> What This Agreement Covers </p>
<p class="indent">We'll pay amounts any protected person is legally required to 
  pay as compensatory damages for &#133; advertising injury that's caused by an 
  offence committed while this agreement is in effect.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Advertising injury means injury caused by any of the following 
  offences that result from the advertising of your products or work&#133; [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [24] Although the language of the 2000 policy differs somewhat from the language 
  contained in the 1998 and 1999 policies, nothing turns on that difference. The 
  2000 policy still requires a direct causal link between advertising and the 
  offence alleged. Once again, I note that the June 29, 2001 statement of claim 
  contains no such allegation.</p>
<p>
  [25] Finally, I observe that the fresh as amended statement of claim that the 
  appellant sought to tender as fresh evidence adds nothing new to the issue of 
  causation.</p>
<p>
  III. Disposition</p>
<p> [26] I conclude that the application judge erred in finding that Taske's June 
  29, 2001 statement of claim includes allegations that are capable of triggering 
  the appellants' advertising injury coverage. However, in the result, I agree 
  with his disposition of the application. In light of my conclusion on the causation 
  issue, it is unnecessary that I finally determine the issues concerning the 
  meaning of advertising and the scope of the exclusion clause.[<a href="#a">4]</a><a name="4"></a></p>
<p>
  [27] For the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondents 
  on a partial indemnity basis fixed at $25,000 inclusive of disbursements and 
  applicable G.S.T.</p>
