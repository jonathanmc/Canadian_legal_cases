<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In an order dated December 22, 2003, Pepall J. granted the respondent summary 
  judgment. The effect of her order is to make a consent decree and part of a 
  contempt order issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District 
  of Ohio, Eastern Division ("the U.S. District Court") valid and enforceable 
  in Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant asks this court to set aside the order and dismiss the motion 
  for summary judgment. The respondent cross-appeals asking that additional parts 
  of the contempt order be recognized and enforced.</p>
<p>
  [3] The respondent, an Ohio corporation based in Wadsworth, Ohio, is a manufacturer 
  and retailer of customized golf clubs and golf club heads. It sells a line of 
  golf clubs and golf club heads under the trademark "Trident". </p>
<p>
  [4] On April 27, 1998, the respondent filed a complaint in the U.S. District 
  Court. The complaint was filed against eight named defendants for "trademark 
  infringement, trademark dilution, use of a counterfeit mark, unfair competition 
  and deceptive practices under the Lanham Act, the Ohio Deceptive Trade Practices 
  Act, and the common law". The appellant, an Ontario corporation based in 
  Don Mills, Ontario, was one of the defendants listed in the complaint. In the 
  complaint, the respondent alleged that the appellant was selling and offering 
  for sale golf clubs and/or golf club heads under the infringing trademark "Rident" 
  on its Internet web site. </p>
<p> [5] In July 1998, the appellant and the respondent executed a settlement agreement. 
  On July 28, 1998, Judge Paul R. Matia of the U.S. District Court, endorsed a 
  consent decree that was also signed by the parties. In this consent decree, 
  the appellant agreed that:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the appellant was enjoined from purchasing, marketing, selling or using 
    golf clubs or golf club components bearing the trademark "Trident" or other 
    confusingly similar versions of that mark, other than golf clubs or golf club 
    components purchased by the appellant from the respondent or its authorized 
    distributors;</li>
  <li> within ten days of the execution of the consent decree, the appellant would 
    surrender and deliver to the respondent's counsel all infringing golf clubs, 
    golf club components and promotional material in its possession; and</li>
  <li> the U.S. District Court would retain jurisdiction over the parties for 
    the purpose of enforcing the consent decree and the parties would not contest 
    jurisdiction in any action in the U.S. District Court to enforce the settlement.</li>
</ul>
<p> [6] On December 20, 2002, the respondent filed a Memorandum of Law in Support 
  of Plaintiff's Motion for Order to Show Cause in the U.S. District Court. In 
  this document, the respondent claimed that the appellant should be held in contempt 
  for its violation of the consent decree. The respondent alleged that the appellant 
  had violated the consent decree "by marketing, offering for sale, and selling 
  golf heads which bear the RIDENT and TRIDENT trademarks." The appellant was 
  given notice of the respondent's motion but did not respond. On February 25, 
  2003, Judge Matia released a decision entitled "Findings of Fact, Conclusions 
  of Law, and Order", which we shall call "the contempt order". In the contempt 
  order, Judge Matia found the appellant in contempt of the consent decree. On 
  the basis of this finding, Judge Matia ordered that:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the appellant was again enjoined from purchasing, marketing, selling or 
    using golf clubs or golf club components which bore the "Trident" mark or 
    any confusingly similar designations;</li>
  <li> the appellant was to make an accounting to the respondent of all golf clubs 
    and/or golf club components it had sold which bore such marks;</li>
  <li> the respondent was awarded compensatory damages based on the profits derived 
    by the appellant from its sales of infringing golf clubs and/or golf club 
    components with the specific amount of these damages to be determined on the 
    basis of the appellant's accounting of its sales of infringing golf clubs 
    and/or golf club components;</li>
  <li> the appellant was to surrender all infringing golf clubs and/or golf club 
    components to the respondent's counsel;</li>
  <li> the appellant was to provide the respondent with the names and contact 
    information of the appellant's suppliers of the infringing golf clubs and/or 
    golf club components;</li>
  <li> the appellant was to provide the respondent with the name and address of 
    each purchaser of the infringing golf clubs and/or golf club components; and 
  </li>
  <li>the appellant was to recall all counterfeit and infringing golf clubs and/or 
    golf club components, which it would then forward to the respondent's counsel.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The appellant did not comply with the contempt order. As a result of the appellant's 
  non-compliance with the order to make an accounting, the respondent has not 
  been able to provide the U.S. District Court with a proposed compensatory damages 
  award.</p>
<p>
  [7] On June 18, 2003, the respondent filed a Statement of Claim against the 
  appellant in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. In the Statement of Claim, 
  the respondent claimed that the Ontario courts should recognize and enforce 
  the consent decree and the contempt order. In response, the appellant filed 
  a Statement of Defence claiming that the two U.S. District Court orders were 
  not capable of recognition and enforcement in Ontario because they were not 
  judgments for fixed sums of money. The respondent moved for summary judgment.</p>
<p>
  [8] The motions judge noted, at para. 7 of her reasons that "[t]raditionally, 
  it has been held that a foreign judgment must be for a fixed sum of money or 
  put differently, for a 'definite sum certain'". She gave a thoughtful analysis 
  of the jurisprudence relating to the recognition of foreign judgments and concluded 
  that the issue of the law, as it relates to the requirement that a foreign judgment 
  be for a fixed sum, has not been decided. Nonetheless, based on the principles 
  espoused in Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1077, Hunt 
  v. T&amp;N plc, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 289, United States of America v. Ivey (1995), 
  26 O.R. (3d) 533 (Gen. Div.), aff'd (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 370 (C.A.) and Beals 
  v. Saldanha, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416, she was persuaded that the requirement for 
  a fixed sum might be relaxed depending upon the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>
  [9] We are inclined to agree that the time is ripe for a re-examination of the 
  rules governing the recognition and enforcement of foreign non-monetary judgments. 
  Indeed, such re-examination would accord with the principles expressed by the 
  Supreme Court of Canada in Morguard at p. 1098:</p>
<p class="indent"> The world has changed since the above rules [concerning the 
  recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments] were developed in 19th century 
  England. Modern means of travel and communications have made many of these 19th 
  century concerns appear parochial. The business community operates in a world 
  economy, and we correctly speak of a "world community" even in the face of decentralized 
  political and legal power. Accommodating the flow of wealth, skills and people 
  across state lines has now become imperative. Under these circumstances, our 
  approach to the recognition and enforcement of judgments would appear ripe for 
  reappraisal.</p>
<p>
  [10] That said, in the circumstances of this case, we are of the view that the 
  motions judge erred in declaring the U.S. District Court orders to be enforceable. 
  However the rule is relaxed, it seems clear that a foreign judgment would have 
  to be sufficiently certain in its terms that the Ontario courts could enforce 
  the judgment without having to interpret its terms or vary it: see Unifor&ecirc;t 
  P&acirc;t&eacute; Port-Cartier Inc. v. Zerotech Technologies Inc. (1997), 50 
  B.C.L.R. (3d) 359 (S.C.). </p>
<p>
  [11] In our view, the foreign orders in question are ambiguous in respect of 
  material matters. For example, the critical issue of the scope of the extra-territorial 
  application of the foreign orders is unclear. Do the foreign orders mean that 
  the appellant is enjoined from purchasing, marketing, selling or using infringing 
  golf clubs within the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court, or do they mean 
  that the appellant is enjoined from doing those things anywhere in the world?</p>
<p>
  [12] While we have concluded that the foreign orders in their present form are 
  not enforceable, we note that the respondent is not left without a remedy in 
  Ontario. It may choose to take action based on the settlement agreement entered 
  into by the parties or, possibly, for infringement of its trademark rights if 
  such rights extend to Canada. As well, there are procedures for obtaining the 
  information it requires from the appellant in order to return to the Ohio court 
  and obtain the compensatory damages contemplated by the contempt order. </p>
<p>
  [13] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed the order of the motions judge is set 
  aside and the motion is dismissed. In light of our conclusion that neither order 
  is enforceable in Ontario, the cross-appeal is dismissed without costs. The 
  appellant shall have its costs of the motion below as fixed by the motions judge 
  or as agreed to by the parties. Costs of the appeal to the appellant fixed in 
  the amount of $5,000, inclusive of GST and disbursements. </p>
