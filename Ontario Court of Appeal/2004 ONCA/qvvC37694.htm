<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The reasons of the trial judge in this case are most unsatisfactory. The 
  trial judge made several errors with respect to self-defence. For example, he 
  reversed the burden of proof and made statements suggesting that use of this 
  weapon (a machete) could not be justified under any circumstances.</p>
<p>[2] That said, self-defence depended upon the simple factual issue of whether 
  the appellant was the aggressor as testified to by the Crown witnesses, or whether 
  the appellant was on the ground being attacked by the security guards before 
  wielding the machete. The latter proposition depended on the possibility that 
  despite being set upon by a number of large security guards, the appellant was 
  able to grab the machete, stand up and confront the guards. The trial judge 
  accepted the Crown version of the events and found the defence version did not 
  make any sense. That finding was open to the trial judge and we see no basis 
  for interfering with it. Accordingly, self-defence did not arise, and the errors 
  by the trial judge did not affect the verdict. It follows that this is a proper 
  case to apply the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. </p>
<p>[3] As to disposition, we are not satisfied that the trial judge made any errors 
  in principle. The disposition was appropriate given the seriousness of the offence 
  and the appellant's background and his serious youth record. Accordingly, the 
  appeal from conviction and disposition is dismissed.</p>
