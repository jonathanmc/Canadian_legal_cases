<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Recent decisions of this court and the Supreme Court of Canada recognize 
  that the judicial interpretation of contracts between employers and employees 
  must be informed by the power imbalance between the two and the importance of 
  employment to an individual's dignity and sense of self-worth. The appellant 
  relies on those principles to drive his argument that the court should reconsider 
  its decision in Wallace v. T.D. Bank (1983), 41 O.R. (2nd) 161 (C.A.), and in 
  particular the majority's suggestion that the disappearance of the substratum 
  of an employment contract is limited to the situation where an employee's level 
  of responsibility and status has escalated significantly. Put simply the appellant 
  argues that if an employer unilaterally alters in a fundamental way an essential 
  term in a written contract of employment, the employer cannot subsequently rely 
  on the termination clause in the contract.</p>
<p>
  [2] We need not address the merits of this argument on this appeal. Without 
  commenting on its potential force, the findings of fact made at trial foreclose 
  its success. Even if the court were to accept the legal argument advanced by 
  the appellant, his claim would fail on the facts as found by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant argued that the termination provision in the 1985 written 
  employment contract that he entered in 1985 no longer applied when the respondent 
  terminated his employment in 1994 because the respondent had changed fundamental 
  aspects of his employment during his almost nine years of employment. </p>
<p>
  [4] The trial judge found as a fact that the appellant's employment had not 
  changed in any fundamental way. He held that all of the changes to the appellant's 
  employment contract were small and inconsequential, except for the change in 
  the bonus structure. With respect to the bonus structure, he held that the change, 
  which occurred in the first year of the appellant's employment, was not "so 
  substantial or serious" as to constitute a fundamental breach of the agreement. 
  Furthermore, the trial judge found that even if the change to the appellant's 
  bonus were fundamental to his employment contract, the appellant went beyond 
  condoning it and agreed to it.</p>
<p>
  [5] We think these findings were open to the trial judge on this evidence and 
  reflect no misapprehension of the evidence. They are entitled to deference. 
  Based on those findings of fact, this appeal must fail.</p>
<p>
  [6] Alternatively, the trial judge found that when the president of the respondent 
  terminated the plaintiff in 1994, he offered him six months pay in accordance 
  with the terms of the 1985 agreement. At the appellant's request, the appellant 
  was allowed to continue his employment with the respondent for those six months. 
  During the negotiations concerning the appellant's termination, he never suggested 
  that he was entitled to more than six months notice. He did not give the respondent 
  company any reason to believe that a claim for more than six months would ever 
  be made against the respondent company. Indeed, the appellant made no reference 
  to the notice period in a list of outstanding entitlements he identified as 
  he prepared to leave the respondent company.</p>
<p>
  [7] In these circumstances, we agree with the respondent's submission that the 
  appellant is estopped by his conduct from asserting an entitlement to notice 
  beyond the six months offered by the respondent company and accepted by the 
  appellant.</p>
<p>
  [8] Viewing the same circumstances somewhat differently, and assuming the written 
  agreement was not in force at the time of the termination, the parties by their 
  conduct evinced an agreement whereby the appellant would receive six months 
  notice upon termination.</p>
<p>
  [9] Viewed in either way described immediately above, the appellant's conduct 
  at the time of termination provides an alternative basis upon which his claim 
  should be dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [10] The appeal is dismissed. The respondent is awarded its costs of the appeal 
  fixed at $11,000.00 inclusive of disbursements and GST. </p>
