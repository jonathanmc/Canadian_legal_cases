<p>On appeal from conviction by Justice David J. Nadeau of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated March 28, 2003. The Crown appeals from sentence imposed by 
  Justice David J. Nadeau on May 27, 2003.</p>
<p>
  ROSENBERG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] On March 28, 2003 the appellant was convicted of sexual assault and sexual 
  exploitation. On May 27, 2003, he was sentenced to ninety days imprisonment 
  concurrent on each count, the sentences to be served intermittently, to be followed 
  by twenty-four months probation. The appellant appeals against the conviction. 
  The Crown applies for leave to appeal against the sentence and also seeks to 
  have fresh evidence admitted. At the conclusion of the argument, we informed 
  the parties that the appeal from conviction was dismissed and that we would 
  provide reasons at a later date. We reserved our decision on the Crown sentence 
  appeal. These are our reasons for dismissing the conviction appeal and for allowing 
  the sentence appeal and increasing the sentence to twelve months imprisonment.</p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [2] Although there is an appeal by both R.D. and the Crown, for convenience 
  I will refer to R.D. as the appellant throughout these reasons. The complainant 
  is the appellant's daughter. The allegations of sexual assault and sexual exploitation 
  arise primarily out of massages that the appellant began to give his daughter 
  when she was twelve or thirteen. The massages initially included her legs and 
  buttocks. Eventually, during the massages, the appellant began to put his fingers 
  beneath the complainant's underwear and touch her vagina. During one particular 
  massage he touched her breasts.</p>
<p>
  [3] At some point, according to the complainant, the appellant began to massage 
  the complainant while viewing a video showing "sensual" massages in 
  which the participants were naked. The appellant began to massage the complainant 
  when she was only wearing underwear and later when she wore only a towel placed 
  over her buttocks. On some occasions, even the towel was removed. One time, 
  the appellant attempted to massage her naked breasts but the complainant resisted 
  and started to cry. The complainant's mother, who had been out, came into the 
  bedroom and saw that her daughter was unclothed. By this time the complainant 
  was seventeen years of age. </p>
<p>
  [4] According to the complainant, during the same period that the massages were 
  taking place, the appellant was taking showers with her. The appellant was a 
  custodian at the local public school and also taught karate after hours. When 
  the karate sessions ended, the appellant would take a shower in the girls' shower 
  room. The complainant was often at the school during these times because there 
  she could access the Internet. On perhaps twenty occasions, the appellant persuaded 
  the complainant to have showers with him. There were curtains separating the 
  appellant from the complainant but he would come over to her side and wash her 
  back and buttocks. On one occasion, the complainant had a vaginal infection 
  and the appellant insisted on the complainant letting him examine her vaginal 
  area. The appellant told the complainant not to tell her mother about the showers 
  as she was closed minded and would not understand.</p>
<p>
  [5] There were two other incidents. When the complainant was seventeen years 
  of age, the appellant took the complainant to a local hotel. They sat in the 
  hotel whirlpool and the appellant gave the complainant five or six drinks of 
  hard liquor. The appellant massaged different parts of her body and then put 
  his hands underneath her bathing suit and inserted his thumbs in her vagina.</p>
<p>
  [6] On another occasion the appellant and the complainant went to Belleville 
  to see the complainant's brother, who was attending a special school. The complainant 
  and the appellant stayed in the same hotel room. The appellant again gave the 
  complainant alcohol and she fell asleep. At some point, the complainant woke 
  up and found the appellant rubbing her belly with his hands underneath her nightgown 
  and caressing her breasts. He also put his hand beneath her underwear and touched 
  her clitoris. She tried to pull away but could not. The appellant said there 
  was nothing wrong with what he was doing. She fell asleep again but when she 
  awoke, the appellant was in bed with the complainant with his arm on her belly, 
  and her nightgown was hiked up to her armpits.</p>
<p>
  [7] The last incident was another shower when the complainant was eighteen years 
  of age. After that, the complainant left for college. In 2002, the appellant 
  and his wife separated. Some months later, the complainant went to the police.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant testified and confirmed much of the complainant's evidence. 
  He admitted to performing massages on the complainant when she wore only a towel, 
  but he claimed they were proper massages and not performed for a sexual purpose. 
  He denied massaging the complainant while viewing the sensual massage video. 
  He admitted taking at least one shower at the school at the same time as the 
  complainant but he claimed that they were in separate stalls. He denied the 
  sexual touching at the hotels.</p>
<p>
  THE CONVICTION APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant raises a number of grounds of appeal relating to the trial 
  judge's reasons. In general, the appellant submits that the trial judge did 
  not properly apply the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the questions 
  of credibility, held the appellant's evidence to a much higher standard than 
  that of the Crown witnesses and failed to come to grips fairly with the issues 
  of credibility. I do not agree with these submissions. The trial judge gave 
  lengthy and clear reasons and his approach to assessing the evidence was correct.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant's principal submission relates to the following passages 
  of the reasons for judgment: </p>
<p class="indent"> In many cases involving sexual offences there will be no physical 
  evidence of the alleged offence. As mentioned, what is sought is supporting 
  evidence or independent evidence making it more probable that the complainant's 
  testimony is true.</p>
<p class="indent">Furthermore, in a case such as here, where the accused has chosen 
  to testify, the evidence is to be properly assessed in light of the other evidence 
  as supporting one version of the events over the other.</p>
<p>
  [11] The appellant submits that in these passages the trial judge has applied 
  the civil standard of proof. The appellant misconstrues what the trial judge 
  is doing in this part of his reasons. Both prior to and after the trial judge's 
  comments, above, he referred to the criminal standard of proof and applied the 
  principles in R. v. W. (D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.). In the first 
  paragraph of his reasons set out above, the trial judge addressed the question 
  of confirmatory evidence. For evidence to be confirmatory, it need not be capable 
  on its own of proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt but should be capable 
  of "restoring the trier's faith in the witness' account". See R. v. 
  Kehler, [2004] S.C.J. No. 1 at para. 12.</p>
<p>
  [12] The expression used by the trial judge in the passage quoted above is entirely 
  consistent with this approach to confirmation. I would point out that this is 
  not a case where corroboration or confirmation was required to restore faith 
  in the complainant's testimony. All the trial judge was doing was looking for 
  some independent evidence that would assist him in determining whether the complainant 
  was telling the truth.</p>
<p>
  [13] In the second paragraph, the trial judge was doing nothing more than making 
  the important point that the appellant's evidence had to be assessed having 
  regard to all of the evidence, and not just in isolation. Again, this was the 
  correct approach to determining the issues of credibility. The formula in W. 
  (D.) does not mandate that the accused's evidence is to be viewed in isolation, 
  divorced from the context or other evidence in the case.</p>
<p>
  [14] The appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in finding confirmation 
  from evidence such as the appellant's wife's observation of the complainant 
  when the appellant was giving his daughter a massage, the appellant's admission 
  to giving the massages when his daughter was wearing only a towel and his admissions 
  concerning the shower. The appellant submits that this evidence is neutral at 
  best and shows no more than opportunity. I do not agree. This was highly unusual 
  conduct by a parent. The evidence went far beyond mere opportunity. It confirmed 
  important parts of the complainant's story as to the nature of the massages 
  and other conduct. The evidence did not have to implicate the appellant on matters 
  in dispute to be capable of confirming the complainant's version of events. 
  See R. v. Kehler at para. 15.</p>
<p>
  [15] The appellant also submits that the trial judge focused solely on the reliability 
  of the complainant's evidence when the real issue was her credibility in the 
  sense of sincerity. However, the trial judge made it clear that he was concerned 
  about both reliability and sincerity. Both aspects of credibility were in issue. 
  While parts of the complainant's and appellant's stories were diametrically 
  opposed, it was also part of the appellant's defence that this was simply innocent 
  conduct on his part. The trial judge had to be sure that the complainant, when 
  relating events that occurred several years before, had accurately recounted 
  the incidents.</p>
<p>
  [16] Finally, the appellant submits that the trial judge applied a stricter 
  test in analysing the evidence of the appellant as opposed to that of the complainant. 
  However, Mr. Xynnis fairly concedes that there were no major inconsistencies 
  in the evidence of the complainant. By contrast, the appellant's story of innocent 
  touching was inherently improbable. I see nothing in the trial judge's reasons 
  to support this submission.</p>
<p>
  [17] Finally, the appellant submits that the trial judge improperly relied on 
  the appellant's demeanour when he referred to having observed the appellant's 
  "lecherous nature". The trial judge had earlier cautioned against 
  relying on demeanour to make credibility assessments. It is apparent that the 
  reference to the appellant's lecherous nature related to the conduct as described 
  by the complainant and even by the appellant. The impugned expression was no 
  more than a somewhat inelegant way of finding that the Crown had proved that 
  the touchings were for a sexual purpose.</p>
<p>
  [18] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction.</p>
<p>
  THE SENTENCE APPEAL</p>
<p>
  [19] Crown counsel makes two submissions with respect to sentence. First, Ms. 
  Wassenaar submits that a sentence of ninety days intermittent is manifestly 
  inadequate given the serious nature of the conduct and the gross breach of trust. 
  Second, relying on the fresh evidence, she submits that the trial judge was 
  misled as to the true state of the appellant's employment. </p>
<p>
  [20] I will deal first with the adequacy of the sentence. I agree with the Crown 
  that this sentence is manifestly inadequate. I have described the conduct above. 
  This was a prolonged course of conduct involving the appellant's own daughter. 
  It represented a serious breach of trust. In addition, the appellant used alcohol 
  on two occasions to put the complainant in an even more vulnerable position. 
  The offences have had a serious impact on the complainant. The range of sentence 
  suggested by Crown counsel at trial of fifteen months to two years less one 
  day was the appropriate range given the seriousness of the conduct, even taking 
  into account the appellant's lack of criminal record and good work record.</p>
<p>
  [21] The issue to which the fresh evidence is directed is as follows. The appellant 
  was the head custodian at the local public school. After the appellant was convicted 
  on March 28, 2003, the school board met and decided to terminate his employment. 
  The appellant was notified of this decision by a letter dated May 1, 2003 and 
  sent by registered mail. The appellant admits receiving this letter before the 
  sentencing hearing on May 27, 2003. Nevertheless, the appellant permitted his 
  counsel to make submissions to the court to the effect that he was merely suspended 
  without pay and that a final decision had not yet been made. There is no suggestion 
  that the appellant's trial counsel (not Mr. Xynnis) was aware of the May 1st 
  letter or the true state of affairs.</p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge held that this was not a proper case for a conditional 
  sentence. He was, however, very concerned about the impact of a jail sentence 
  on the appellant's employment. In his reasons, the trial judge placed great 
  emphasis on the fact that the appellant would lose his job if given a period 
  of imprisonment. The only reasonable inference to draw from the proceedings 
  is that the trial judge settled on the maximum intermittent sentence because 
  this was the only way that the appellant could keep his employment.</p>
<p>
  [23] As I have said, the fresh evidence shows that the appellant no longer had 
  employment with the school board when he appeared before the trial judge for 
  sentencing. In an affidavit filed in response to the Crown's fresh evidence 
  application, the appellant explains that he did not consider that the Board's 
  decision was final because he had asked the union to file a grievance on his 
  behalf. His view was that until the grievance was dealt with it was still possible 
  he could maintain his employment. He also says that even after the charge was 
  laid he was permitted to work, albeit at a time that would not bring him in 
  contact with students. </p>
<p>
  [24] I have some doubt about the truth of the appellant's explanation but I 
  am prepared to proceed on the basis that the appellant did not deliberately 
  set out to mislead the trial judge. The fact remains that the trial judge was 
  misled and that this misinformation contributed to the imposition of a wholly 
  inadequate sentence.</p>
<p>
  [25] The Crown has met the test for admission of fresh evidence on a sentence 
  appeal. See R. v. Levesque, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 487. The appellant concedes that 
  the Crown's fresh evidence should be admitted and likewise the Crown agrees 
  to the admission of the appellant's responding affidavit.</p>
<p>
  [26] The question of an appropriate sentence is a difficult one. The appellant 
  completed serving his intermittent sentence in December of last year. While 
  the court is always very concerned about returning an offender to prison in 
  such circumstances, that factor takes on less importance where, as here, the 
  appellant has contributed to the situation that led to the improper sentence. 
  However, the additional hardship of returning the appellant to custody must 
  be given some consideration and warrants imposition of a lesser sentence than 
  might otherwise be imposed.</p>
<p>
  [27] Mr. Xynnis forcefully argued on behalf of the appellant that if this court 
  was of the view that the 90-day sentence was inadequate, the court should impose 
  a conditional sentence. In my view, this is not a case for a conditional sentence. 
  No one factor is dispositive of this issue. It is the combination of factors 
  that, in my view, make a conditional sentence inappropriate, including the serious 
  breach of trust, the length of time over which the offences occurred, the number 
  of incidents, the seriousness of the conduct and the use of alcohol to increase 
  the vulnerability of the complainant. I am not satisfied that a conditional 
  sentence would meet the objectives of denunciation and deterrence. I agree with 
  the trial judge that this was also a case where specific deterrence was an important 
  factor. The fact that the appellant did not seem to recognize the inappropriateness 
  of his conduct, even on his own version of events, is of real concern and indicates 
  that specific deterrence was an appropriate objective. </p>
<p>
  [28] Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal the sentence, allow the appeal 
  and increase the sentence to twelve months imprisonment. Having regard to the 
  fact that the appellant was on probation during the time when he was serving 
  the intermittent sentence I would reduce the term of probation to twelve months 
  on the same terms as imposed by the trial judge.</p>
