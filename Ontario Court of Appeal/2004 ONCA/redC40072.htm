<p>On appeal from the judgment granted by the Justice John C. Kennedy of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated April 30, 2003.</p>
<p>
  R.A. BLAIR J.A.: </p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>
  [1] Red Carpet Inns Limited is the owner of a motel property on Lakeshore Blvd. 
  W. in Etobicoke. The lands, now vacant, are situated along what was at one time 
  known as "the Motel Strip". They abut the shores of Lake Ontario.</p>
<p>
  [2] This appeal arises out of a proposed land exchange between Red Carpet and 
  the Crown, designed to facilitate the creation of a linear lakefront park by 
  the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and to enable Red 
  Carpet to acquire title to certain lands it had been using but that were in 
  fact unpatented Crown lands. The exchange was never effected. As a result, Red 
  Carpet sued the Crown and the Conservation Authority for damages for breach 
  of contract and negligent misrepresentation (amongst other relief claimed). 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] Kennedy J. dismissed the claim for breach of contract, but found the Conservation 
  Authority liable for negligent misrepresentation. He dismissed the claims against 
  the Crown. Although he assessed the plaintiff's damages at $30,159,744, the 
  trial judge only awarded the plaintiff $971,111.90, representing interest lost 
  on a related but aborted transaction (the Chertsey transaction) together with 
  certain other out-of-pocket expenses up to October, 1989. This decision was 
  based on the finding that Red Carpet had independently chosen not to accept 
  a profitable $10 million settlement for the sale of the lands to Chertsey at 
  that time, and therefore that no "further losses were foreseeable after 
  the plaintiff had the opportunity to dispose of its entire interest in the property".</p>
<p>
  [4] Red Carpet appeals from the trial judge's decision that it was not entitled 
  to its full damage claim because it purportedly breached a duty to mitigate 
  its losses, and also from the trial judge's failure to hold the Crown liable 
  as principal for the Conservation Authority in respect of communicating the 
  negligent misrepresentation. The Conservation Authority cross-appeals against 
  the finding of negligent misrepresentation. Red Carpet and the Crown both seek 
  to attack the trial judge's award as to costs, Red Carpet alleging that he erred 
  in reducing its costs to 50% of the fixed amount and the Crown asserting that 
  he erred in failing to award it any costs at all.</p>
<p>
  [5] For the brief reasons that follow we would dismiss the appeal and allow 
  the cross-appeal. The issue of whether the Crown acted as agent for, or is vicariously 
  liable for, the acts of the Conservation Authority is therefore academic and 
  need not be determined. The costs should follow the event.</p>
<p>
  Summary of Facts</p>
<p>
  [6] In the late 1960's the Province of Ontario developed a plan to create a 
  park system along the shores of Lake Ontario from Scarborough to Hamilton. The 
  Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority was designated as the 
  implementing agency for that purpose. To meet its objectives it needed to acquire 
  lands at various places along the shoreline to enable it to fill in the shoreline 
  in order to create the linear parkland desired. Red Carpet's lands were suitable 
  for these purposes, as they projected beyond the waterline into the lake. </p>
<p>
  [7] Red Carpet, on the other hand, had its own needs. The lands had significant 
  potential commercially. However, part of a "sliver" of land, which 
  it occupied and used, to the immediate west of its own lots, belonged to the 
  Crown as unpatented Crown lands. So, too, did a small parcel of land immediately 
  to the south of the sliver and to the west of the Red Carpet lots (Part 3). 
  Red Carpet needed clear title to these Crown lands in order to maximize their 
  potential for sale or development.</p>
<p>
  [8] In the early 1980's, therefore, the interests of Red Carpet and the Conservation 
  Authority converged. The makings of an arrangement for an exchange of lands 
  evolved. Red Carpet would give up some waterfront property plus the riparian 
  rights thereto; the Crown would grant Red Carpet a patent to the Crown lands 
  Red Carpet needed. This arrangement was set out in a letter from the Ministry 
  of Natural Resources to the Conservation Authority, dated March 23, 1984. The 
  parties refer to this letter as "the roadmap" for the exchange. The 
  lawsuit arises because they never made it to their destination along this map.</p>
<p>
  [9] In the mid to late 1980's the politics changed regarding plans for the Motel 
  Strip. The City of Etobicoke began to consider a number of scenarios for the 
  redevelopment of the lands between the Humber River and Mimico Creek. One potential 
  plan included a road across the Crown lands which formed part of the exchange. 
  The Ministry advised the Conservation Authority in a letter dated May 23, 1987 
  that the exchange proposal was postponed indefinitely and would have to be "held 
  in abeyance" until Etobicoke had finalized its rezoning "or definitively 
  approved the redevelopment/parkland/road configuration". Notwithstanding 
  this, the Conservation Authority continued its discussions with the appellant. 
  In January 1989, the Conservation Authority was told by a special advisor to 
  the Premier of Ontario on waterfront issues that the arrangements with Red Carpet 
  would not be completed. The trial judge found that the Ministry's decision not 
  to proceed with the land exchange was not communicated to Red Carpet. Instead, 
  the Conservation Authority held out that the project was still alive, subject 
  to the making of certain minor modifications.</p>
<p>
  [10] In the meantime, Red Carpet entered into an agreement with Chertsey Development 
  Inc. to sell the property, including whatever rights it had in the land exchange 
  agreement, for $10 million. This transaction did not close because Chertsey 
  requisitioned a deed to the unpatented Crown lands that were the subject of 
  the proposed exchange. Chertsey knew that Red Carpet could not provide such 
  a deed at that point and, indeed, it would appear that Chertsey was not entitled 
  to requisition the deed, given the terms of its agreement. Nonetheless, litigation 
  ensued. The litigation was ultimately settled on a "walk away" basis, 
  but - significantly for these proceedings - Chertsey offered to settle in October 
  1989 on the basis that it would pay Red Carpet the $10 million purchase price 
  and take its chances on completing the land exchange. Red Carpet refused this 
  offer because it was not prepared to forego $871,000 in interest that it said 
  it was entitled to as a result of the delay in closing. </p>
<p>
  [11] The trial judge found that there was never a binding agreement between 
  Red Carpet and the Crown with respect to the land exchange because the parties 
  were never ad idem on the essential terms of the transaction, particularly with 
  respect to the issue of riparian rights. There is no appeal from this finding. 
  He also found, however, that the failure of the Conservation Authority to advise 
  Red Carpet of the Ministry's decision not to complete the arrangement constituted 
  an actionable negligent misrepresentation. That finding is the subject of the 
  cross-appeal. Lastly, the trial judge found that, although the plaintiff's damages 
  should be assessed at approximately $30 million, it was only entitled to recover 
  its lost interest and certain out-of-pocket expenses in relation to the Chertsey 
  transaction for a total of $971,111.90. This latter finding is the subject of 
  the appeal.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [12] Because of the view we take of this case it is appropriate to deal with 
  the cross-appeal first.</p>
<p>
  The Cross-Appeal</p>
<p>
  [13] The Conservation Authority raised two grounds in its cross-appeal. </p>
<p>
  [14] First, it argued that the trial judge erred in finding that it had misrepresented 
  the status of the land exchange arrangement. There was ample evidence to support 
  the trial judge's finding in this regard, however, and we see no basis for interfering 
  with it.</p>
<p> [15] Secondly, the Conservation Authority submitted that the trial judge erred 
  in finding that all the constituent elements of the tort of negligent misrepresentation 
  had been met.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> In particular it was argued 
  that the elements of (a) reliance, (b) reasonable reliance, and (c) detrimental 
  reliance, were missing on the facts.</p>
<p>
  [16] We can find no palpable or overriding error in the trial judge's finding 
  that Red Carpet relied on the misrepresentation of the Conservation Authority 
  or that it was reasonable for it to continue to operate on the premise that 
  the land exchange would be completed. There was evidence that might lead to 
  a different conclusion on reasonableness. For example, Mr. Vona admitted he 
  knew the deal "was stuck" in the Ministry - the difference between 
  being "stuck" and held "in abeyance" may be a subtle one 
  - and there is evidence he knew the planning considerations of Etobicoke were 
  still outstanding. The trial judge's findings on these questions are entitled 
  to deference, however, and we can find no palpable and overriding error in his 
  findings in this regard.</p>
<p>
  [17] Nonetheless, we agree with the cross-appellant that the trial judge's finding 
  of detrimental reliance in the circumstances of this case constituted a palpable 
  and overriding error. It was based upon misapprehension of the evidence, which 
  does not support a finding that if Red Carpet had known of the Ministry's decision 
  not to proceed with the land exchange it would have acted in a way that would 
  have protected it from the detriment it allegedly suffered.</p>
<p>
  [18] The trial judge found Mr. Vona to be an "astute and sophisticated 
  businessman with a special interest and high degree of expertise in the area 
  of land development". As noted, he was aware that the deal was stuck in 
  the Ministry, that the Etobicoke planning issues affecting the exchange lands 
  had not been resolved, and that Red Carpet had title defect problems. Red Carpet 
  conducted itself accordingly. It knew that it could not enter into agreements 
  for the property that called for the delivery of clear title, and Mr. Vona acknowledged 
  that he did not entertain offers containing such a requirement. With respect 
  to the Chertsey transaction, and an earlier offer from another prospective purchaser, 
  Red Carpet's solicitor protected its interests by only agreeing to convey that 
  to which Red Carpet had clear title together with its interest in the land exchange, 
  whatever those interests may be.</p>
<p>
  [19] More significantly, it was not open to the trial judge to find that Red 
  Carpet had relied to its detriment on the Conservation Authority's misrepresentation 
  because in reality it benefited from not being aware of the Ministry's decision. 
  Had it known, Mr. Hoffer argued, Red Carpet would have attempted to sell only 
  that which it was entitled to sell without adding whatever rights it may have 
  had arising from the land exchange arrangement. The evidence is that it would 
  have recovered less for the land than the $10 million available to it from the 
  Chertsey transaction. Consequently, Red Carpet's lack of knowledge of the true 
  state of affairs and its continued reliance on the premise that the land exchange 
  would come to fruition, worked to its advantage rather than to its detriment. 
  </p>
<p>
  [20] In the absence of detrimental reliance the tort of negligent misrepresentation 
  is not made out. There is no liability on the part of the Conservation Authority. 
  The cross-appeal must be allowed.</p>
<p>
  The Main Appeal</p>
<p>
  [21] In view of the foregoing, the appeal must fail as well.</p>
<p>
  [22] The losses sustained by Red Carpet flowed not from any detrimental reliance 
  upon the Conservation Authority's misrepresentation but rather from the failure 
  of the Chertsey transaction to close. Chertsey was prepared to accept the lands 
  and take its chances on negotiating a more favourable exchange with the Crown. 
  Its dispute with Red Carpet was founded upon its apparently dubious requisition 
  respecting the defect in title. Although completion of the land exchange would 
  have resolved the title defect, the misrepresentation concerning the termination 
  of that arrangement was not the cause of the failure to close. The evidence 
  is clear that this failure had nothing to do with the termination of the land 
  exchange arrangement. </p>
<p>
  [23] It follows, therefore that no damages flowed from the misrepresentation.</p>
<p>
  [24] The foregoing analysis aside, there is another reason why the appeal must 
  be dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [25] Red Carpet did not find out about the Ministry's decision not to proceed 
  with the land exchange until the proceedings leading up to the trial of this 
  action. The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in failing to award 
  it full damages on the basis that Red Carpet had a duty to mitigate its losses 
  when, at the relevant time, Red Carpet was unaware of any wrongdoing on the 
  part of the Conservation Authority.</p>
<p>
  [26] While the trial judge did refer to the failure of the appellant to mitigate 
  its damages by rejecting the Chertsey settlement offer, in paragraph 168 of 
  his reasons (as a prelude to his consideration of the damage calculations), 
  we think in substance his decision not to award the appellant its full damages 
  is based on a lack of causation. This is apparent from the following passage 
  at paragraph 164: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Red Carpet determined its own independent course of action in declining the 
  Chertsey proposal. It continued to rely upon the defendants to bargain in good 
  faith and to negotiate [a] successful land exchange transaction. I query whether 
  or not any further losses were foreseeable after the plaintiff had the opportunity 
  to dispose of its entire interest in the property [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [27] We agree. The appeal must be dismissed.</p>
<p>
  Costs</p>
<p>
  [28] Given our disposition of the appeal and the cross-appeal, the arguments 
  of Red Carpet and the Crown respecting the costs below need not be addressed. 
  The defendants have been wholly successful. Costs should follow the event.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [29] The appeal is dismissed and the cross-appeal allowed.</p>
<p>
  [30] The respondents are entitled to their costs of the appeal on a partial 
  indemnity basis, fixed for each in the amount of $15,000, inclusive of fees, 
  disbursements and GST.</p>
<p>
  [31] The respondents are also entitled to their costs of the trial on a partial 
  indemnity basis. In view of the complexity of the issues, the length of the 
  trial, the amounts claimed, and the unfamiliarity of this court with the trial 
  dynamics, we do not think we should fix the costs. The costs of the respondents 
  at trial are therefore to be assessed rather than fixed by this court.</p>
