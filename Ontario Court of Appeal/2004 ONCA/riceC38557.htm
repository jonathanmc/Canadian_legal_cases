<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: June 4, 2004</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant appeals his conviction for robbery and his sentence of two 
  years in the penitentiary. On his conviction appeal the appellant makes five 
  submissions: </p>
<p>
  (1) the verdict was unreasonable; </p>
<p>
  (2) the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury on the eyewitness identification 
  evidence; </p>
<p>
  (3) the trial judge failed to give an adequate instruction on circumstantial 
  evidence; </p>
<p>
  (4) the trial judge failed to adequately explain the theory of the defence; 
  and </p>
<p>
  (5) the trial judge erred in instructing the jury on motive.</p>
<p>
  [2] Before dealing with each submission we make two general observations. First, 
  defence counsel at trial (not Ms. Kranjc) approved the trial judge's charge 
  before it was given and made no objection to it afterwards. Second, this was 
  a relatively short and simple case, in which the defence led no evidence. We 
  now turn to the specific grounds of appeal.</p>
<p>
  1. Unreasonable verdict</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant argues that neither the circumstantial evidence about the 
  car nor the eyewitness identification evidence reasonably supported the verdict. 
  We do not agree. The evidence must be considered as a whole. In our view, on 
  the whole of the evidence, the verdict is one a properly instructed jury could 
  render.</p>
<p>
  2. The eyewitness identification evidence</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant contends that the trial judge should have instructed the jury 
  that the eyewitness identification evidence had no probative value. We do not 
  accept this contention. Although not strong standing alone, the eyewitness identification 
  evidence was probative. Its reliability and its weight were for the jury to 
  determine. The trial judge drew to the jury's attention, adequately in our view, 
  the weaknesses and discrepancies in the evidence, and as we have said, defence 
  counsel approved the charge and made no objection to the way the trial judge 
  dealt with this evidence.</p>
<p>
  3. Circumstantial evidence</p>
<p>
  [5] As this court has said several times a charge on circumstantial evidence 
  need not follow a fixed formula. What is central is that a trial judge convey 
  the requirement that for the jury to convict on circumstantial evidence it must 
  be satisfied that the Crown has proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt. The 
  trial judge adequately conveyed this requirement.</p>
<p>
  4. Defence theory</p>
<p>
  [6] The trial judge gave the jury the theory of the defence requested by defence 
  counsel. On appeal the appellant now argues that the trial judge should have 
  highlighted the discrepancies and the problems in the eyewitness identification 
  evidence. Ideally the trial judge might have done so, but especially in the 
  light of the defence position at trial, we see no error in her not having done 
  so.</p>
<p>
  5. Motive</p>
<p>
  [7] The Crown elicited some evidence of motive during Ms. Morrow's testimony. 
  Therefore, we cannot accept the appellant's submission that either the trial 
  judge should not have charged the jury on motive or should have given a proved 
  absence of motive instruction. Moreover, in our view the trial judge's charge 
  on motive was fair and balanced.</p>
<p>
  [8] Accordingly, the appellant's appeal against conviction is dismissed. </p>
<p>
  Sentence</p>
<p>
  [9] The trial judge's sentence discloses no error in principle and is not demonstrably 
  unfit. Despite the appellant's commendable efforts to rehabilitate himself, 
  a two year sentence for a robbery with a weapon on a vulnerable victim was entirely 
  appropriate.</p>
<p>
  [10] Accordingly, although leave to appeal sentence is granted, the sentence 
  appeal is dismissed.</p>
