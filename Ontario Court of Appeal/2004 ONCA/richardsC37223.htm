<p>On appeal from the convictions before Justice David Samuel Crane of the Superior 
  Court of Justice and a jury on October 24, 2001.</p>

<p>
  McCOMBS J. (ad hoc): </p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals his convictions for forcible entry, unlawful confinement, 
  robbery, and use of an imitation firearm, arising out of a home invasion in 
  Hamilton on March 29, 1999. This was the second trial for the appellant following 
  a re-trial ordered by this court on December 8, 2000. The central issue at both 
  trials was the appellant's identity as one of the two robbers. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant raises four grounds of appeal, alleging that the trial judge, 
  Crane J.: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) failed to adequately caution the jury regarding the evidence 
  of identification;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) failed to review the defence evidence;</p>
<p class="indent">(c) erred by rejecting the defence motion to exclude the evidence 
  regarding the appellant's purported use of the aliases, "Steve" and "Romy"; 
</p>
<p class="indent">(d) erred by permitting the Crown to introduce as an exhibit, 
  the notes of a police officer, Constable Mbakulo, after the conclusion of his 
  evidence.</p>
<p>[3] I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.</p>
<p>
  FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>
<p>
  [4] Three witnesses, present in the home when the invasion occurred, gave evidence 
  at trial. They were Gerald Stanton, Jessica Garnett, and her mother, Laurie 
  Pacsai. Each identified the appellant as one of the two robbers. Garnett also 
  testified that she believed that he was the same man whom she and Stanton had 
  met briefly in Roxie's, a local tavern, the previous night, and who had identified 
  himself with two names, "Steve" and "Romy". Stanton substantially 
  confirmed Garnett's evidence on this point, but said that the appellant had 
  used only the name "Steve" at Roxie's the night before the robbery. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] After a voir dire, the trial judge permitted the Crown to call the evidence 
  of two police officers that the appellant had previously used the names "Steve" 
  and "Romy" as aliases. This evidence was important to the Crown's 
  case. Indeed, in his address to the jury, Crown counsel relied heavily on the 
  confirmatory value of the evidence of the aliases, which he called "unique 
  identifiers" that, in his submission, confirmed the reliability of the 
  identification evidence. </p>
<p>
  [6] The trial focussed on the credibility and reliability of the witnesses, 
  both as to their purported eyewitness identification, and also as to their evidence 
  about the appellant's alleged use of the aliases. In my view, there were sufficient 
  problems with the evidence on both these issues that it was incumbent upon the 
  trial judge to provide clear and specific instructions as to how to approach 
  this evidence. Unfortunately, the trial judge's instructions on these issues 
  fell short of what was required in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p>
  THE EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE</p>
<p>(a) The motion to exclude the identification evidence</p>
<p>[7] Defence counsel at trial (not Mr. Lockyer) applied unsuccessfully to exclude 
  the identification evidence of the three eyewitnesses on the basis that it was 
  so demonstrably unreliable that its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative 
  value. There were serious problems with this evidence. Indeed, in dismissing 
  the applications, the trial judge acknowledged those problems, and indicated 
  that he would provide a "detailed and pointed charge on the frailties of 
  identification evidence and the evidence of the witnesses being tainted". 
  </p>
<p>
  [8] It is necessary to outline some of the problematic features of the identification 
  evidence in order to provide an understanding of the issues raised on appeal. 
  </p>
<p>
  (b) The identification evidence of Jessica Garnett</p>
<p>[9] Jessica Garnett identified the appellant as the intruder who forced Gerald 
  Stanton into the basement. Her initial description, given shortly after the 
  robbery, was very general. She described the person she later identified as 
  the appellant as a clean-shaven black male about 23 years old, with short hair, 
  around 5'6" to 5'8" tall, weighing approximately 160 pounds, who spoke 
  with a Jamaican accent. She provided no description of facial features or any 
  other distinguishing features. When shown a photo line-up about six weeks later, 
  she "stared" at the line-up for 10 to 15 minutes before Detective 
  Rees, the officer in charge, stated "you appear to be staring at a picture; 
  which picture are you looking at?" Ms. Garnett then picked the photograph 
  of the appellant, and said, "it's his face". The defence position 
  was that the action of Detective Rees had tainted the identification process 
  and undermined the reliability of Ms. Garnett's identification. </p>
<p>
  [10] There was other evidence capable of supporting the defence claim of tainting. 
  Ms. Garnett testified that about a week after the photo line-up, Detective Rees 
  showed her a blown-up colour photograph of the appellant, told her they had 
  caught the man she identified, and said that she had picked out the "right" 
  picture. Detective Rees denied deliberately showing Ms. Garnett the blown-up 
  colour photo of the appellant, but acknowledged that she may have "glimpsed" 
  it in his file.</p>
<p>
  (c) The identification evidence of Ms. Pacsai</p>
<p>[11] Ms. Pacsai, like her daughter Ms. Garnett, also gave a very general initial 
  description of the robbers. She described both intruders as black, 5'6" 
  to 5'7" and approximately 160 pounds. Six weeks later, she failed to pick 
  anyone from the photo-line-up, and commented that "they all look the same 
  to me." She identified the appellant for the first time at the courthouse 
  nine months later when she came to testify at the preliminary inquiry. Although 
  Ms. Pacsai denied it, there was evidence capable of supporting the conclusion 
  that her courthouse identification was further tainted by the fact that it came 
  after she saw her daughter's emotional reaction upon seeing the appellant.</p>
<p>
  (d) The identification by Gerald Stanton</p>
<p>[12] When interviewed after the home invasion, Mr. Stanton denied that he had 
  been robbed. After his refusal to cooperate, he was arrested on an immigration 
  warrant, and shortly thereafter he changed his story and acknowledged that he 
  had indeed been robbed. He gave no description of the intruders except to say 
  that one of them was wearing a light khaki-coloured hat. Six weeks later, he 
  failed to pick the appellant out of a photo line-up and was described as "un-cooperative" 
  by Detective Rees. Mr. Stanton's first identification of the appellant came 
  at the first trial, more than a year after the robbery. At that trial, Mr. Stanton 
  testified that he first saw the appellant on the seventh floor of the courthouse 
  at the courtroom door. At the second trial, Mr. Stanton said that he first saw 
  the appellant at the entrance to the courthouse; he also acknowledged in cross-examination 
  that Detective Rees had told him that he had spoken to immigration authorities 
  on his behalf and had advised them that he was cooperating as a witness in this 
  case. </p>
<p>
  THE "ALIASES EVIDENCE"</p>
<p>
  [13] Jessica Garnett and Gerald Stanton both testified that they had briefly 
  met the appellant the night before the robbery at Roxie's, a local tavern. Garnett 
  said that the appellant used two names, "Steve" and "Romy", 
  while Stanton said he used only the name "Steve". </p>
<p>
  [14] The aliases evidence had been the basis for the retrial ordered by this 
  court on December 8, 2000. At the first trial, the Crown sought to prove by 
  means of a CPIC record that the appellant had previously used the aliases "Steve" 
  and "Romy". This court quashed the conviction and ordered a retrial 
  on the basis that, in the circumstances, the CPIC record was inadmissible: R. 
  v. Richards, (unreported) (case file #C34156), Endorsement, released December 
  8, 2000. </p>
<p>
  [15] At the second trial, Crown counsel called two police officers to demonstrate 
  that the appellant used these aliases on other occasions, and relied heavily 
  upon the evidence as "unique identifiers" that confirmed the reliability 
  of the eyewitness identification evidence. </p>
<p>
  [16] The value of the aliases evidence as confirmation of the identity of the 
  appellant as one of the robbers was hotly contested at trial on two bases. The 
  defence claimed, firstly, that the police officers' evidence as to the appellant's 
  use of the aliases was unreliable, and secondly, that Ms. Garnett's recollection 
  of the appellant using the name Romy was a result of Detective Rees telling 
  her that the appellant was known to use that alias. </p>
<p>
  (a) Jessica Garnett's evidence about the intruder's use of the names "Steve" 
  and "Romy" </p>
<p>
  [17] In a videotaped statement to police given a few hours after the robbery, 
  Ms. Garnett referred to the person she met at Roxie's the night before the robbery 
  as "Steve" throughout her statement. She never referred to him as 
  Romy, nor did she claim in that statement that he had ever identified himself 
  as Romy.</p>
<p>
  [18] By the time of the preliminary inquiry, however, Ms. Garnett had abandoned 
  the name Steve and referred to the intruder as Romy throughout her evidence. 
  She said that Romy was the only name she knew for the intruder and that he never 
  used any other name.</p>
<p>
  [19] When confronted at the preliminary inquiry with the transcript of her video 
  statement in which she had used the name Steve twenty-nine times, Ms. Garnett 
  insisted that the transcript was incorrect, and that she had used the name Romy, 
  not Steve, in her original videotaped interview.</p>
<p>
  [20] By the time of the second trial, Ms. Garnett claimed that she had been 
  confused, and that the appellant had used both Steve and Romy. She also claimed 
  that she could not remember whether she had said "Steve" or "Romy" 
  in her original videotaped statement. She nevertheless denied that Detective 
  Rees or anyone else had suggested the name Romy to her. </p>
<p>
  [21] Detective Rees denied telling Ms. Garnett that Romy was a name used by 
  the robber, or ever talking to her about her evidence on this point. When confronted 
  with his testimony at the first trial wherein he acknowledged that he probably 
  did speak to Ms. Garnett about this issue, he said that counsel had confused 
  him at the first trial. </p>
<p>
  (b) the evidence of Gerald Stanton regarding the robber's use of the names Steve 
  and Romy</p>
<p>
  [22] Mr. Stanton testified that he was introduced to the man at Roxie's as Steve, 
  not Romy, and that Ms. Garnett referred to him exclusively as Steve before and 
  after the robbery. Mr. Stanton testified that the first time he heard the name 
  Romy was from Detective Rees at the photo line-up six weeks after the robbery. 
  Stanton testified that when he called the robber Steve, Detective Rees corrected 
  him, telling him that the robber used the name Romy. Detective Rees testified 
  that he could not recall the conversation. Detective Rees acknowledged that 
  by the time of the photo line-ups, he did have information from the CPIC printout, 
  associating the name Romy with the appellant. </p>
<p>
  (c) the evidence of the police officers concerning the appellant's purported 
  use of the names "Steve" and "Romy" </p>
<p>
  [23] A police officer testified that the appellant had identified himself using 
  the name "Steve" on another occasion four months prior to the robbery. 
  A second police officer testified that he investigated the appellant on May 
  30, 1994, more than seven years earlier, and that through reference to his notes, 
  he recalled the appellant identifying himself as "Romy". </p>
<p>
  THE DEFENCE EVIDENCE </p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant testified. He acknowledged four prior criminal convictions, 
  the most serious being a drug conviction for which he was sentenced to eight 
  months imprisonment. He denied involvement in the home invasion and testified 
  that he did not know where he was that night because he did not learn he was 
  a suspect until two and one half months later, and because nothing exceptional 
  had occurred that night. He swore that at the time of the robbery, he had not 
  been clean-shaven with short hair, as Jessica Garnett had claimed, but instead 
  had a beard, a moustache, and long hair. He also swore that he had never used 
  the aliases Romy or Steve. </p>
<p>
  [25] The appellant's mother and his former wife both testified and confirmed 
  his evidence. </p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [26] I will deal with each ground of appeal in turn. </p>
<p>
  (a) The adequacy of the charge to the jury regarding the evidence of identification 
  </p>
<p>
  [27] In his initial charge, the trial judge instructed the jury concerning the 
  general frailties of eyewitness identification evidence as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  You must be very cautious about relying on eyewitness testimony to find anyone 
  guilty of a criminal offence. In the past there have been miscarriages of justice. 
  Persons have been wrongly convicted because eyewitnesses have made mistakes 
  identifying the person whom they saw committing a crime. Eyewitness testimony 
  is an expression by a witness of his or her belief or impression. It is quite 
  possible for an honest witness to make a mistake in identification. Honest people 
  do make mistakes and apparently convincing witnesses can be mistaken. </p>
<p>[28] The trial judge also addressed some of the specific frailties of the eyewitness 
  evidence, and referred to others in his recharge. However, in my opinion, the 
  charge as a whole did not adequately address the particular frailties of the 
  identification evidence in this case. It is incumbent upon a trial judge to 
  not only instruct the jury as to the general frailties of identification evidence, 
  but also as to the specific problems presented by the case before the court: 
  See for example, R. v. Hibbert, (2002) 163 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.), per Arbour 
  J. at para. 50, R. v. Tebo, (2003) 175 C.C.C. (3d) 116 (Ont. C.A.), per Feldman 
  J.A. at paras. 18,19. </p>
<p>
  [29] Although there were multiple errors in the charge on identification, I 
  will discuss only the four that I regard as most serious: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (i) Jessica Garnett's initial description of the robber as clean-shaven </p>
<p>
  [30] Jessica Garnett initially described the robber who forced Gerald Stanton 
  into the basement (allegedly the appellant) as a clean-shaven man with short 
  hair. When the appellant was arrested, he had facial hair. The appellant, his 
  mother, and his former wife all testified that at the time of the offence, the 
  appellant had a moustache, a beard, and long hair. Obviously, if the robber 
  was clean-shaven with short hair, and the appellant at that time had a beard, 
  a moustache and long hair, then he could not have been the robber. An eyewitness 
  description that contains dissimilarities to the accused is either valueless 
  or exculpatory: Chartier v. A.G. Que. (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 34 at pp. 51-2. 
  (S.C.C.), R. v. Quercia, (1990) 60 C.C.C. (3d) 380 at 386-7 (Ont. C. A.), R. 
  v. Boucher, (2000) 146 C.C.C. (3d) 52 at 58 (Ont. C.A.). Although the trial 
  judge dealt with this issue, he did so in a cursory way, and failed, in my view, 
  to adequately convey its significance to the jury. Moreover, he did not review 
  the defence evidence and remind the jury that the appellant, his mother and 
  his sister, all testified that the appellant had long hair, a moustache and 
  a beard at the time of the robbery. </p>
<p>
  (ii) the circumstances surrounding the identification of the appellant by Ms. 
  Pacsai and Mr. Stanton: their failure to identify the appellant in a photo line-up, 
  and their identification of the appellant at the courthouse many months after 
  the robbery </p>
<p>
  [31] The trial judge reminded the jury that Ms. Pacsai and Mr. Stanton identified 
  the appellant for the first time at the courthouse. In the case of Ms. Pacsai, 
  the identification came at the preliminary hearing, and in the case of Mr. Stanton, 
  at the trial. Although he offered a mild caution to the jury about the danger 
  of relying on their identification in those circumstances, the trial judge made 
  no mention of the fact that both witnesses had failed to identify the appellant 
  when they were shown photo line-ups six weeks after the robbery. In my opinion, 
  in the circumstances of this case, the trial judge was obliged to draw the jury's 
  attention to this failure, and to emphasize that it seriously undermined the 
  already tenuous identification evidence of these two witnesses. </p>
<p>
  (iii) the problem of cross-racial identification-Ms. Pacsai's statement when 
  viewing the photo line-up that "they all look the same to me" </p>
<p>
  [32] Where cross-racial identification is an issue, it may be appropriate to 
  caution the jury about the difficulties that can present for a particular witness: 
  R. v. McIntosh, (1995) 117 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 395 (Ont. C.A.). The comment of 
  Ms. Pacsai when she was viewing the photo line-up that "they all look the 
  same to me" raises a concern that she was experiencing difficulty with 
  cross-racial identification. Given the other frailties in her identification 
  evidence, it was important to caution the jury that her difficulties with cross-racial 
  identification may have further eroded the reliability of her evidence. </p>
<p>
  (iv) the confidence of the identification witnesses is not an indication of 
  the accuracy of their evidence</p>
<p>
  [33] In his charge concerning the general frailties of eyewitness identification 
  evidence, the trial judge told the jury that witnesses can be honest and convincing 
  and yet be mistaken. Later, however, when discussing specific identification 
  witnesses, the trial judge invited the jury to consider how sure they were of 
  their identification. In reality, there is "a very weak link between the 
  confidence level of a witness and the accuracy of that witness": R. v. 
  Hibbert, supra, per Arbour J. at pp. 147-8. Indeed, certainty on the part of 
  an honest identification witness is part of the reason that eyewitness identification 
  evidence is dangerous. In my opinion, in the circumstances of this case, instead 
  of mentioning certainty as a measure of reliability, it was incumbent upon the 
  trial judge to explain the tenuous relationship between the confidence level 
  of the identification witnesses and the accuracy of their evidence. Unfortunately, 
  he did not do so. </p>
<p>
  (b) The failure to adequately review the defence evidence and to relate the 
  issues to the theory of the defence. </p>
<p>
  [34] There was considerable emphasis during the trial upon the appellant's alleged 
  use of the aliases, "Steve" and "Romy". The issue of the 
  reliability of the police evidence that he used these aliases was squarely raised 
  at trial, and in my view, there was an air of reality to the defence assertion 
  that the alias evidence was unreliable. Furthermore, Jessica Garnett (the only 
  witness who picked the appellant out of a photo line-up) referred to the robber 
  as Steve twenty-nine times in her interview with police, and never mentioned 
  the name Romy. There was a real question, founded in the evidence, as to whether 
  Ms. Garnett's recollection had been tainted by Detective Rees. The reliability 
  of the alias evidence was an important issue in the trial. Indeed, in his address 
  to the jury, Crown counsel relied heavily on the alleged aliases as "unique 
  identifiers" that bolstered the otherwise weak identification evidence. 
  The trial judge, early in his charge, said this: </p>
<p class="indent">
  the case against Lenford Richards depends to a large extent on eyewitness testimony. 
  The other factor is the use of the names and I will discuss that part separately. 
  </p>
<p>
  [35] Unfortunately, however, the trial judge did not review the evidence of 
  the use of names by the appellant, except briefly when discussing the positions 
  of the Crown and the defence.</p>
<p>
  [36] Following objection by defence counsel, the trial judge made brief reference 
  in his re-charge to the conflict between Mr. Stanton's evidence and that of 
  Detective Rees as to where Stanton heard the name Romy. The trial judge did 
  not refer at all to the evidence of the appellant, his mother and his girlfriend, 
  each of whom swore that the appellant never used the names Steve or Romy.</p>
<p>
  [37] With respect, given the importance of this issue, it was incumbent upon 
  the trial judge to review the conflicting alias evidence and to relate it to 
  the issues from the perspective of the Crown and the defence. </p>
<p>
  [38] Unfortunately, the trial judge's review of the evidence was unhelpful and 
  unbalanced. The trial judge reviewed the evidence of the Crown witnesses in 
  detail over approximately twenty pages of transcript. For the most part, the 
  trial judge read from his notes, which were in point form and at times confusing. 
  He made only passing reference to the evidence of the appellant, and did not 
  discuss the evidence of the other two defence witnesses at all. He did not review 
  the evidence in a manner that related it to the issues in the case. </p>
<p>
  [39] There is no formula concerning the extent to which a trial judge is obligated 
  to review the evidence and relate it to the issues at trial, but the charge 
  must, at a minimum, ensure that the jury understands the factual issues, the 
  relevant law applicable to those issues, the positions of the parties, and the 
  evidence relevant to those positions. See: R. v. Mackinnon (1999), 132 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 545 at 555, R. v. Jacquard (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at 11, and 
  R. v. Maugey (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 99 at pp. 108-111 (Ont. C.A.). Unfortunately, 
  the charge to the jury in this case fell short of what was minimally required.</p>
<p>
  [40] The conclusions that I have reached concerning the adequacy of the charge 
  to the jury are sufficient to require a new trial. However, since the remaining 
  two issues would affect a third trial, it is appropriate to comment on them. 
  </p>
<p>
  (c) did the trial judge err by rejecting the defence motion to exclude the evidence 
  regarding the appellant's purported use of the aliases, "Steve" and 
  "Romy"?</p>
<p>
  [41] In pre-trial motions, the appellant sought to exclude the alias evidence, 
  alleging that in each case, it was obtained in breach of his right to counsel 
  under s. 10(b) of the Charter. The appellant argued that in both cases, his 
  alleged use of the aliases came after he was detained and before he was informed 
  of his right to counsel. The appellant argued that accordingly, the evidence 
  was "conscripted" and should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter 
  because its introduction would compromise trial fairness and thus bring the 
  administration of justice into disrepute. </p>
<p>
  (i) The "Steve" voir dire.</p>
<p>
  [42] The trial judge initially ruled that he was "prepared to assume" 
  that the appellant was detained when he told the police his name was Steve. 
  A week later, in what he called an "addendum" to his ruling, he held 
  that the appellant was not detained when he used the name "Steve". 
  He concluded that in any event, the introduction of the evidence would not bring 
  the administration of justice into disrepute, and it was therefore admissible. 
  </p>
<p>
  [43] The trial judge also concluded, "in the alternative" that: </p>
<p class="indent">It is my view that the decision in R. v. Hanneson, 49 C.C.C. (3d) 467, at page 
  472, is applicable to this case in that s. 10(b) is a protection against self-incrimination 
  as to an offence committed and that there is no protection against future criminal 
  acts. (emphasis added) </p>
<p>
  [44] The trial judge was in error in holding that the protection against self-incrimination 
  does not extend to future criminal acts. It is well-established that the protection 
  against self-incrimination can extend to protect an accused from the use in 
  a subsequent proceeding of material previously obtained from an accused by state 
  compulsion: See R. v. S. (R.J.) 1995, 96 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [45] In my opinion, the evidence clearly supports the conclusion that the appellant 
  was under detention and had not been informed of his right to counsel when he 
  allegedly gave the name "Steve". The evidence is therefore properly 
  viewed as conscriptive evidence obtained following a Charter breach: See R. 
  v. Cook (1998) 128 C.C.C. (3d) (S.C.C.) 1, per Cory J. at pp. 31-2. Such evidence 
  is presumptively inadmissible as compromising trial fairness, unless it is shown 
  that the evidence would probably have been obtained in any event, without the 
  unlawful conscription: See R. v. Bartle (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 320 (S.C.C.), 
  R. v. Harper (1994) 92 C.C.C. (3d) 423 at 430 (S.C.C.), R. v. Hachez (1995) 
  101 C.C.C. (3d) 31 at pp. 44-46 (Ont. C.A.). Unfortunately, the trial judge 
  did not address this latter issue, having held that the appellant was not detained 
  when he allegedly gave the police the name "Steve". </p>

<p>
  (ii) The "Romy" voir dire</p>
<p>
  [46] In ruling the "Romy" evidence admissible, the trial judge assumed 
  a violation of the appellant's 10(b) rights and relied on s. 24(2) for his conclusion 
  that the evidence was admissible. He ruled: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I find the breach, if one, not to be serious. I find the societal interest in 
  a trial to be high. I find the individual interest of the accused to fail in 
  the balance&#133;I find that at the time and in the circumstances, the 10(b) 
  breach, on the basis that it occurred for this analysis, is not one that requires 
  the evidence to be excluded, as it has not been established that the admission 
  of it in these proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
  </p>
<p>
  [47] With respect, the trial judge erred in the manner in which he applied s. 
  24(2) to the evidence. As I noted above, if the evidence was obtained in violation 
  of the appellant's s. 10 (b) rights, it was conscriptive evidence, and it is 
  therefore presumptively inadmissible unless the Crown can show on a balance 
  of probabilities that the evidence would have been obtained in any event, without 
  the Charter breach. The trial judge did not address this issue in accordance 
  with established legal principles. </p>
<p> (d) did the trial judge err by permitting the Crown to introduce as an exhibit, 
  the notes of a police officer, Constable Mbakulo, after the conclusion of his 
  evidence.</p>
<p> [48] Ms. Klukach conceded in oral argument that the trial judge erred in permitting 
  the officer's notes to be adduced in evidence but submitted that their admission 
  occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. In light of my conclusion 
  that a new trial must be ordered, it is not necessary to consider the significance 
  of this error. </p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [49] I would allow the appeal and order a new trial. It will be for the Crown 
  to determine whether it is in the interests of justice to proceed with a third 
  trial. </p>
