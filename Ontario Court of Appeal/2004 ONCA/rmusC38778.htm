<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: June 15, 2004</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant advanced a number of grounds of appeal but at the hearing 
  pressed only three. </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The appellant contends that once the trial judge found there 
  was no concluded consulting agreement, she could not have found an exclusive 
  supply agreement. We disagree. On the facts, the two arrangements between the 
  parties were not so interrelated that a finding that there was no concluded 
  consulting agreement was fatal to a finding of an exclusive supply agreement.</p>
<p class="indent"> 2. The appellant argues that the Statement of Claim was so 
  "grossly deficient" that the trial judge was without jurisdiction to make the 
  finding that an exclusive supply agreement had been concluded. In our view, 
  this argument must fail for two reasons. First, the amended Statement of Claim 
  pleads both a consulting services agreement and an exclusive supply arrangement. 
  Second, it is apparent from a reading of the transcript -- see for example p. 
  103 of the Respondent's Compendium -- that counsel were aware that the existence 
  of an exclusive supplier agreement was a central issue. </p>
<p class="indent"> 3. The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in finding 
  an exclusive supply agreement. Specifically, he says that the absence of agreed 
  upon terms such as pricing, delivery, quantity and quality rendered the arrangement 
  an "agreement to agree" rather than a concluded agreement.</p>
<p class="indent"> A contract can be found to exist even if not all of its terms 
  have been expressly agreed upon. Normally, to find an enforceable contract for 
  the supply of goods, one would expect to find either agreement as to price or 
  agreement as to the mechanism for determining price. However, while it would 
  have been preferable for the trial judge to make clear her findings as to the 
  agreed upon terms of the exclusive supplier agreement, in the circumstances 
  of this case, we are satisfied that there was an implied term that raw materials 
  would be provided at a reasonable price. We are of this view because of the 
  following findings of the trial judge, which findings are entitled to deference:</p>
<p class="indent"> (i) the plaintiff was given the right to be the exclusive supplier 
  of all raw materials;</p>
<p class="indent"> (ii) the agreement was concluded at an early stage in the development 
  of the appellant's business when the precise materials needs would not have 
  been known; and</p>
<p class="indent"> (iii) the plaintiff had provided consideration for the contract, 
  at the outset, in the form of the business proposal, the know-how and the introduction 
  of Peter Ashton.</p>
<p>
  [2] In respect of the quantification of damages, again we note that it would 
  have been preferable had the trial judge given more fulsome reasons including 
  how she determined that twelve months was the appropriate period and 15 per 
  cent the appropriate profit margin, but we are not persuaded that she was in 
  error in so concluding. There was evidence to support the rate that she applied 
  (i.e. 15 %) and, taking into account a combination of the consideration that 
  the respondent gave, the fact that it was supplied at the outset of the development 
  of the appellants' business, and the duration of the relationship between the 
  parties, we cannot say that the twelve month period was in error.</p>
<p>
  [3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent fixed 
  in the amount of $7,500.00, inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
