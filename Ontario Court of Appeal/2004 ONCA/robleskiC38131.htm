<p>On appeal from the surrender order of the Honourable Martin Cauchon, Minister 
  of Justice for Canada, dated April 12, 2002 and on application for judicial 
  review of the committal order for extradition of Justice Arthur C. Whealy of 
  the Superior Court of Justice dated November 14, 2001. </p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  A. Introduction</p>
<p>
  [1] The United States of America seeks to extradite Daniel Robleski for six 
  counts of incest alleged to have been committed on his daughter in the State 
  of Missouri between April 1, 1998 and May 29, 1998. After a hearing, Whealy 
  J. committed Mr. Robleski for extradition on six counts of the Canadian offence 
  of sexual assault. The Minister of Justice then ordered his surrender on the 
  six incest counts. Mr. Robleski appealed the committal order and sought judicial 
  review of the surrender order. After hearing from his counsel we dismissed both 
  his appeal and his application for judicial review, with reasons to follow. 
  These are our reasons. </p>
<p>
  B. Background Facts</p>
<p>
  [2] The record before the extradition judge disclosed the following salient 
  facts.</p>
<p>
  [3] The complainant had lived away from her father from the age of three. However, 
  in early 1998 she moved into his home, an apartment in St. Charles, Missouri. 
  She was eighteen years old at the time, but went to a learning disabled school 
  and had a maturity level much lower than eighteen years. </p>
<p>
  [4] Soon after she moved in, the appellant began to sleep in her bed. About 
  a month later he began licking her vagina and buttocks, inserting his finger 
  into them and touching her breasts. He also had her stroke his penis, until 
  he would "cum". The appellant continued this inappropriate sexual 
  touching almost nightly for about a month and a half ending on May 29, 1998. 
  Two days later the complainant got in touch with the police. </p>
<p>
  [5] She explained that the appellant would get "pissed off" and yell 
  at her if she did not do what he wanted her to do. She complied with his requests 
  because she did not want her father to be angry with her. She and her brothers 
  had just gotten back together and she was afraid of losing this family bond. 
  Several times she faked being asleep to avoid having anything to do with the 
  appellant. At times the appellant asked her to tell him "I love it when 
  you lick my pussy daddy" and she did so because "he scared me". 
  </p>
<p>
  [6] After the appellant was arrested he admitted that he and his daughter slept 
  together, that he had licked her vagina five or six times and that he had touched 
  her vagina or her anus many times. He also acknowledged that his daughter had 
  stroked his penis at least three times and he confirmed her evidence that the 
  sexual touching had taken place for about a month and a half. </p>
<p>
  C. The Appeal Against the Committal Order </p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant raised two grounds of appeal against the committal order.</p>
<p>
  1.) The respondent failed to establish a prima facie case of lack of consent; 
  and</p>
<p>
  2.) The respondent failed to establish a prima facie case of six counts of sexual 
  assault. </p>
<p>
  1. Consent </p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant contended that there was no direct evidence of a lack of consent 
  because in her interview with the police the complainant was not asked whether 
  she consented to the appellant's sexual touching. </p>
<p> [9] In our view, the evidence in the record amply demonstrated that the complainant 
  did not consent to the appellant's sexual activity. This evidence included the 
  following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The appellant initiated sexual activity with his dependent, vulnerable and 
    immature eighteen year old daughter. Such conduct is inconsistent with consensual 
    sex. See R. v. M.(M.L.) (1992), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 318 (N.S.C.A.).</li>
  <li>The complainant did not resist the appellant's sexual advances because if 
    she did not comply with his demands he would get "pissed off" and yell at 
    her. As the extradition judge aptly observed: <br>
    <br>
    think there is some evidence that she did not consent in the sense that we 
    use the word, she was not a willing participant, and if she submitted out 
    of fear that is not consent according to our law.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  2. Prima Facie Case on Six Counts versus One Count</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant submitted that he ought to have been committed on one count 
  of sexual assault, not six. He argued that, even assuming the respondent made 
  out a prima facie case of lack of consent within the specified time period, 
  it proved only one "global count" of sexual assault.</p>
<p>
  [11] We take a different view. The extradition judge fulfilled his statutory 
  jurisdiction under s. 29 of the Extradition Act by holding a hearing to determine 
  whether the evidence supported a committal on the Canadian offence described 
  in the authority to proceed. He properly amended the authority to proceed under 
  s. 23 of the Act and committed the appellant for his conduct during the agreed 
  upon period. In so doing he was entitled to take into account that the State 
  of Missouri sought the appellant's extradition on six counts, and correspondingly, 
  to treat the relevant "conduct" as amounting to six counts of sexual 
  assault. </p>
<p>
  [12] For these brief reasons the appeal is dismissed. </p>
<p>
  D. The Application for Judicial Review of the Surrender Order</p>
<p>
  [13] The applicant applied for judicial review of the Minister's surrender order 
  on three grounds: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1.) Surrendering him would be unfair and contrary to s. 7 of 
  the Charter;</p>
<p class="indent">2.) Alternatively, if he is surrendered on six counts of incest, 
  the Minister should require as a condition of surrender that the applicant face 
  concurrent, not consecutive, sentences; and</p>
<p class="indent">3.) The Minister should require as a condition of surrender 
  that the applicant be given credit for his pre-trial custody in Canada.</p>
<p>
  1.) Fairness</p>
<p>
  [14] The appellant submitted that the Minister ought not to have ordered his 
  surrender because of the combination of two considerations: the case against 
  him on the issue of consent was weak; and under Missouri law the offence of 
  incest, even without intercourse, does not require proof of lack of consent. 
  Accordingly, a weak case on the issue of consent in Canada will never be assessed 
  in the United States. Therefore, the applicant submitted that surrendering him 
  undermines the principle of reciprocity. We saw no merit in this submission. 
  </p>
<p>
  [15] First, for the reasons we have already outlined we do not view the case 
  against the appellant as weak, even under Canadian law. The extradition judge 
  found that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case, and as we have already 
  said, the record amply supports that finding. </p>
<p>
  [16] Second, and more important, once a prima facie case has been established, 
  unless surrendering the applicant would be "simply unacceptable" or 
  "shock the conscience of our society" the Minister may not refuse 
  to do so. The applicant could not meet this stringent threshold. </p>
<p>
  2.) Consecutive versus Concurrent Sentences</p>
<p>
  [17] The applicant argued that because he ought only to have been committed 
  on one global count of sexual assault the Minister should not have surrendered 
  him to face six separate counts of incest and the possibility of six consecutive 
  sentences. We do not agree with this argument. </p>
<p>
  [18] The Minister surrendered the applicant on the conduct underlying the foreign 
  offence, consistent with s. 58(b) of the Extradition Act. Moreover, the Minister 
  held that he could find no compelling grounds under the Act, the Treaty or the 
  Charter justifying making the applicant's surrender conditional on his receiving 
  concurrent time if convicted. We are not persuaded that in so holding the Minister 
  erred. </p>
<p>
  3.) Pre-trial Custody</p>
<p>
  [19] The applicant spent about two and a half months in a Canadian jail. He 
  submitted that Missouri will not give him credit for pre-trial custody unless 
  he waived his extradition. The applicant contended that this amounted to an 
  abuse of process. The Minister rejected this argument. We see no reviewable 
  error in his decision.</p>
<p>
  [20] In Missouri the State Department of Corrections determines credit for time 
  spent in pre-trial custody. Although the department's policy is to deny credit 
  for time served in another jurisdiction while contesting an extradition, this 
  policy does not amount to an abuse of process. Even in Canada credit for pre-trial 
  custody is discretionary. To turn a discretionary principle under Canadian law 
  into a mandatory condition of surrender to a foreign jurisdiction would run 
  counter to the proposition articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. 
  v. Burns (2001), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 97 "that individuals who chose to leave 
  Canada must generally accept the local law, procedure and punishments which 
  the foreign state applies". As the Minister observed: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If convicted, Mr. Stassi will be sentenced by the court in the United States 
  of America, which will determine a fit and appropriate sentence for the offences 
  under American law. Furthermore, the administration of the sentence is for American 
  authorities who are entitled to consider all the facts and circumstances relating 
  to Mr. Stassi in making decisions regarding the administration of his sentence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [21] Accordingly, the application for judicial review is dismissed. </p>
