<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: January 30, 2004</p>
<p>
  [1] We agree with the appellant's submission that this is a straightforward 
  "over 80" case in which the trial judge was entitled to reject the 
  evidence to the contrary. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court justice erred 
  in law by improperly characterizing the trial judge's factual finding respecting 
  the reliability of the respondent's evidence and in holding that the trial judge 
  failed to apply the appropriate test in assessing the respondent's evidence 
  to the contrary.</p>
<p>
  [2] In respect to the first error, in our view the Summary Conviction Appeal 
  judge misstated the trial judge's finding concerning the reliability of the 
  respondent's evidence and then improperly substituted his opinion for that of 
  the trial judge. At p. 7 of his reasons for judgment, the Summary Conviction 
  Appeal judge stated that the trial judge "found no fault as to the evidence 
  of the appellant, except to say that he was not necessarily "historian"."</p>
<p>
  [3] The reasons for judgment of the trial judge, however, clearly state that, 
  having regard to the totality of the evidence, the respondent's testimony was 
  not believable or reliable and did not raise a reasonable doubt. He stated that 
  the respondent's evidence did "not have the degree of precision necessary 
  to safely constitute a foundation for the expert's opinion". The trial 
  judge's finding as to the unreliability of the respondent's evidence was solidly 
  grounded in the evidence. As such, the trial judge was entitled to reject the 
  respondent's evidence and there was no basis for interference with his findings 
  of fact in that regard.</p>
<p>
  [4] In respect to the second error, we are of the view that the Summary Conviction 
  Appeal judge erred in finding that the trial judge applied an incorrect burden 
  of proof when assessing the evidence to the contrary. The trial judge began 
  by instructing himself as to the proper test to be applied. While the trial 
  judge refers to cases that are not obviously relevant, that discussion relates 
  to the trial judge's attempt to deal with speculation. The trial judge did not 
  place the onus on the respondent to conduct his own scientific experiments on 
  the breathalyzer instrument or his own body as a pre-requisite to a Carter defence.</p>
<p>
  [5] Leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed. The acquittal by the 
  Summary Conviction Appeal court is set aside and the conviction is restored.</p>
