<p>On appeal from the order of Justice W. J. Lloyd Brennan of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated June 12, 2002.</p>
<p class="boldcenter"> ADDENDUM ON COSTS</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant, while not found to be guilty of contempt, deliberately violated 
  the Confidentiality Agreement he signed at the mediation. This conduct is relevant 
  to whether he is entitled to his costs.</p>
<p>
  [2] Moreover, this appeal raises legal issues affecting mediation which have 
  not previously been considered. Given their significance and novelty, we are 
  of the view that there should be no costs awarded in this appeal.</p>

  "RSA" "Robert P. Armstrong J.A."</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  BORINS J.A. (Dissenting): </p>
<p>
  [3] In my view, the successful appellant is entitled to his costs of the motion 
  and the appeal. As this is not the occasion for a discursive review of circumstances 
  which may result in the court exercising its discretion to deprive a successful 
  litigant of costs, I will be brief in discussing the two reasons why I believe 
  the appellant should have his costs.</p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [4] The starting point is the principle of long standing that a successful party 
  is entitled to his or her costs. This is a principle from which the court should 
  not depart except for very good reasons. As this court stated in Bell Canada 
  v. Olympia &amp; York Development Ltd. (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 135 at 142: "While 
  it is well-established that a successful party has no entitlement to costs, 
  that party is entitled to a reasonable expectation [of costs] in the absence 
  of special circumstances". In my view, there is neither a good reason nor 
  any special circumstance that would justify depriving the appellant of his costs.</p>
<p>
  [5] It is suggested that this case is an exception because the issue was novel. 
  In M. M. Orkin, The Law of Costs, 2nd ed (Aurora, Ontario: Canada Law Book, 
  looseleaf) at pp. 2-38 to 2-58, the author summarizes numerous decisions disposing 
  of appeals without costs where, inter alia, the question involved was new or 
  not previously decided by the courts, or the court determined an uncertain or 
  unsettled point of practice or law. In my view, the issue on this appeal was 
  not of sufficient novelty to constitute an exception to the general principle 
  on costs. As stated in our reasons for allowing the appeal, (now reported: (2003), 
  232 D.L.R. (4th) 523) Rule 24.1 does not support a finding that the appellant 
  was in contempt of court as nothing in the rule precluded the appellant from 
  publishing the first article, and rule 24.14 does not address confidentiality 
  of the mediation process. As this conclusion followed a plain reading of Rule 
  24.1, I have difficulty in appreciating that the issue raised in the appeal 
  was in any way novel. Nor was there any novelty in our further holdings that 
  the confidentially agreement was not capable of enforcement under Rule 60 and 
  that nothing in the article published in purported breach of the confidentiality 
  agreement was capable of compromising a fair trial.</p>
<p>
  [6] I would add that an appellate judgment that considers an issue or question 
  for the first time, or determines an uncertain point of practice or law, is 
  not uncommon. From the perspective of the range of appeals considered by this 
  court, this common situation does not constitute "special circumstances" 
  or an exceptional case. It is expected that an appellate court will clarify 
  the law when it is unclear. Something more is required to justify departing 
  from the long-standing general rule on costs, otherwise successful litigants 
  will be penalized by the court's refusal to award costs in their favour. See 
  Blue Range Resource Corp. (Re) (2001), 202 D.L.R. (4th) 523 (Alta. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  [7] The other reason why the appellant should not be deprived of his costs is 
  based on the remedy sought by the respondent. As pointed out in our reasons 
  for judgment at p. 537, it is a serious matter for a person to be found in contempt 
  of court. A contempt proceeding is punitive in nature with broad powers given 
  to the court, including the power to order imprisonment. A person found in contempt 
  of court is entitled to bring proceedings before this court to clear his or 
  her name. When successful, a party should not have to bear the costs of defending 
  against the serious allegation that he or she had acted in a way that exhibited 
  contempt for the court. In my view, together with the judgment of this court, 
  an appropriate award of costs constitutes public rehabilitation of the appellant's 
  reputation.</p>
<p>
  [8] In Canada Metal Co. Ltd. v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (No. 2) (1975), 
  8 O.R. (2d) 375, this court was asked to determine whether the trial judge had 
  exercised his discretion judicially in depriving the appellant of the costs 
  of his successful defence of a motion to commit him to jail for contempt of 
  court by violating an injunction in the alleged production by him of a news 
  bulletin. Although the trial judge found that there was insufficient evidence 
  to prove this allegation, he had a strong suspicion that the appellant was involved 
  in some way in the bulletin's production. When the appellant declined the trial 
  judge's invitation to remove his suspicion by filing an affidavit stating that 
  he had nothing to do with the production of the news bulletin, the trial judge 
  deprived him of his costs of the motion.</p>
<p>
  [9] In allowing the appellant's appeal and awarding him costs of the motion, 
  at p. 376 Jessup J.A. held: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The proceeding before the learned trial Judge was a quasi-criminal proceeding, 
  and the learned trial Judge found a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the 
  appellant. Having so found, in my opinion, he proceeded in error of principle 
  in denying the appellant his costs, simply because of a suspicion which existed 
  in the learned trial Judge's mind. Different considerations might apply if this 
  were not a quasi-criminal proceeding.</p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  [10] I would note that in response to our reasons for judgment, the Civil Rules 
  Committee is to consider an amendment to rule 24.1.14 that will add to the existing 
  rule a provision that all communications at a mediation session and the mediator's 
  notes and records shall "be subject to the deemed undertaking as provided 
  in rule 30.1.01". If the amendment is passed, it seems that its effect 
  will be to preclude one party to a mediation session from using information 
  provided by the other party for purposes other than those of the proceeding 
  in which the information was provided.</p>
<p>
  IV</p>
<p>
  [11] For the foregoing reasons, I would award the appellant his costs of the 
  motion and the appeal on a partial indemnity basis. The costs of the motion 
  and the appeal are fixed at $6,350 and $10,600, respectively, each inclusive 
  of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
