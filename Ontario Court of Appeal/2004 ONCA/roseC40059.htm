<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal from the order of Madam Justice Benotto dated April 29, 
  2003 in which Justice Benotto declared that "at the time of the loss, the 
  Plaintiffs owned, leased, operated or otherwise controlled 633 Eastern Avenue, 
  Toronto, Ontario within the meaning of clause 3 of the declarations page of 
  Policy Number 4508496, and was covered up to a limit of $20,075,000.00."</p>
<p>[2] Taking into account the nature of the policy (a substantial commercial 
  policy involving a client known to carry on business in investment and real 
  estate development), the broad wording used to describe the location and description 
  of premises insured (all premises owned, leased, operated or otherwise controlled 
  by the insured), the limited duration of the policy (one year from January 9, 
  2001 to January 9, 2002) and the failure to identify with precision those properties 
  for which full coverage of over $20 million was intended during the policy period, 
  we are inclined to think that it was open to the applications judge to conclude 
  that the policy in question was effectively an "open" policy, such 
  that the insured was entitled to full coverage not only on those premises which 
  it owned, leased, operated or otherwise controlled at the inception of the policy, 
  but those premises which it came to own, lease, operate or control during the 
  policy period. However, for reasons that follow, we need not finally decide 
  that issue. </p>
<p>[3] The question that remains is whether at the time of the loss, the insured 
  "owned, leased, operated or otherwise controlled" the premises at 
  633 Eastern Avenue, Toronto. In that regard, we note that at the time of the 
  loss, the insured had entered into an Agreement of Purchase and Sale to buy 
  the subject property. The sale was conditional upon "court approval" 
  and approval had not been obtained as of the date of the loss. </p>
<p>[4] Under clause 39 of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale, the insured acknowledged 
  that the agreement was "personal to the purchaser" and that neither 
  it, nor any monies paid under it created "an interest in the property". 
  Under the same clause, the insured agreed that it would not register the agreement 
  or cause or permit it to be registered and that no reference to or notice of 
  it or any caution, certificate of pending litigation or other similar court 
  process in respect of it was to be registered on title.</p>
<p>[5] In short, at the time of the loss, it would appear that the insured had 
  bargained away any beneficial or equitable ownership interest it might otherwise 
  have had at common law flowing from a binding Agreement of Purchase and Sale.</p>
<p>[6] That said, we do not read the terms of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale 
  as meaning that the insured did not have an insurable interest in the subject 
  property at the time of loss. We do however see it as a basis for rejecting 
  the insured's submission that at the time of the loss, it had a beneficial or 
  equitable ownership interest in the property, such that it was entitled to full 
  coverage. Accordingly, we respectfully disagree with the finding of the applications 
  judge to the contrary.</p>
<p>[7] Despite our view that the insured was not entitled to full coverage, we 
  are nonetheless satisfied that it was entitled to the limited coverage (up to 
  $2.5 million) provided for under the "Acquired Locations" clause of 
  the policy. The wording of that clause is very different from the wording of 
  the clause or clauses giving rise to full coverage. The "Acquired Locations" 
  clause speaks of coverage from the date of acquisition, after the inception 
  date of the policy, of premises purchased, occupied or for which the insured 
  may become responsible. </p>
<p>[8] In our view, the word "purchased" in that clause is wide enough 
  to cover the situation that existed at the time of the loss. In short, we think 
  it can be said that the insured had "purchased" the subject property 
  under the Agreement of Purchase and Sale. At very least, the language used in 
  the "Acquired Locations" clause is sufficiently ambiguous to trigger 
  the contra proferentem doctrine in favour of the insured. Accordingly, we think 
  the insured was entitled to claim up to $2.5 million for the loss in question.</p>
<p>[9] These reasons address and are meant to address the particular, if not unique 
  circumstances of this case. They should not be taken as an indication that we 
  would necessarily have arrived at the same conclusion as the applications judge 
  had the Agreement of Purchase and Sale been unconditional and had the insured 
  not bargained away its common law beneficial ownership interest. Under those 
  circumstances, we do not foreclose the possibility that the "Acquired Locations" 
  clause would still govern. That however, is a matter for another day.</p>
<p>[10] For these reasons, the order of the applications judge cannot stand. In 
  the result, the appeal is allowed, the order under appeal is set aside and in 
  its place, an order will go declaring that at the time of loss, 633 Eastern 
  Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, was an acquired location within the meaning of the 
  "Acquired Location" extension in clause 4(a) of the Property Section 
  of Policy Number 4508496 and was covered up to a limit of $2,500,000.</p>
<p>[11] With respect to costs, in the circumstances, the parties shall bear their 
  own costs of the application and the appeal.</p>
