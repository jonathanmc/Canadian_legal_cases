<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Chester C. Misener of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated April 11, 2003.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] The plaintiff (respondent) Clarence John Ross sued the defendants (appellants) 
  Brian and Diane Hern for one-third of the proceeds of a winning Lotto 6/49 ticket 
  in the amount of $500,000.00. The issue at trial was whether Brian Hern had 
  purchased the winning ticket for himself or in partnership with the defendants. 
  The trial judge found that it was bought in partnership and ordered that the 
  plaintiff was entitled to one-third of the proceeds. The defendants appeal the 
  decision.</p>
<p>
  [2] The issue on this appeal deals with the interventions of the trial judge 
  during the evidence of the parties.</p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge was very involved in the examination-in-chief and cross-examination 
  of the plaintiff. He had lengthy discussions with the plaintiff in an attempt 
  to understand the intricacies involved in buying lottery tickets. Many questions 
  were of doubtful relevance and other questions had no relevance to the issue 
  to be determined. </p>
<p>
  [4] In 98 pages of transcript, there were a total of 238 questions or interruptions 
  by the trial judge during the evidence of Mr. Ross.</p>
<p>
  [5] The witness, Diane Hern, is the wife of the defendant Brian Hern. The trial 
  judge again asked many questions. Certain questions were confrontational and 
  others of doubtful relevance. He also made gratuitous comments and conducted 
  eight pages of pure cross-examination. At the end of her evidence, the trial 
  judge commented: "Amazing, just amazing." There was nothing amazing 
  about her evidence. Indeed, the trial judge says nothing to suggest otherwise 
  in his reasons for judgment.</p>
<p>
  [6] In 69 pages of transcript, there were 235 questions or interruptions by 
  the trial judge during the evidence of Diane Hern.</p>
<p>
  [7] With respect to the defendant Brian Hern, the trial judge jumped into the 
  arena before counsel had a chance to develop his examination. He interfered 
  with counsel's questioning and cross-examined the defendant over some ten pages. 
  The trial judge at one point told the witness: "Well I want you to listen 
  to the question because I'm interfering too much in Mr. Reid's cross-examination." 
  This was not an overstatement. The witness was not refusing to answer questions 
  and was not being evasive.</p>
<p>
  [8] In 125 pages of transcript, there were a total of 295 questions or interruptions 
  by the trial judge during the evidence of Mr. Hern. </p>
<p>
  [9] Although the trial judge interrupted the testimony of each party a significant 
  number of times, the interruptions of the plaintiff were different from those 
  of the defendants. When he was interrupting Ross, it was generally to clarify 
  testimony or seek further information. The interruptions of the defendants, 
  however, were of a different tone. The trial judge tended to be sarcastic and 
  condescending toward the defendants, and numerous times he appeared to badger 
  them into giving the answer for which he was looking.</p>
<p>
  [10] Even if one only considers the sheer number of questions and interruptions 
  that went on during the giving of the evidence in this trial, the trial judge 
  acted inappropriately. The trial judge interrupted so much that the parties 
  were not able to present the case as they saw fit. The trial judge was an active 
  participant in the case. He was not an impartial arbiter.</p>
<p>
  [11] It has always been accepted that on occasion it is not only desirable but 
  necessary that the trial judge question a witness for the purpose of clarification 
  of the evidence. However, it is appropriate to recall the words of this court 
  in Majcenic v. Natale, [1968] 1 O.R. 189 (C.A.), where the court addressed the 
  issue of interventions by a trial judge. At p. 205, the court stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  When a judge intervenes in the examination or cross-examination of witnesses, 
  to such an extent that he projects himself into the arena, he of necessity, 
  adopts a position which is inimical to the interests of one or other of the 
  litigants. His action, whether conscious or unconscious, no matter how well 
  intentioned or motivated, creates an atmosphere which violates the principle 
  that "justice not only be done, but appear to be done". Intervention 
  amounting to interference in the conduct of a trial destroys the image of judicial 
  impartiality and deprives the Court of jurisdiction. The right to intervene 
  is one of degree and there cannot be a precise line of demarcation but if it 
  can be fairly said that it amounted to the usurpation of the function of counsel 
  it is not permissible.</p>
<p>
  [12] In the present case, the trial judge crossed the line set out in Majcenic. 
  The questions were not only numerous but were of such a character as to amount 
  to an unwarranted interference with counsel's conduct of the trial. The trial 
  judge effectively took the case into his own hands and out of the hands of counsel: 
  see J.M.W. Recycling Inc. v. Attorney-General of Canada (1982), 35 O.R. (2d) 
  355 at p. 362 and Farrar v. Farrar (2003), 63 O.R. 141 (C.A.) at paragraph [25].</p>
<p>
  [13] This court has stated on numerous occasions that in appeals based on undue 
  interventions in the examinations of witnesses, the test is not so much prejudice 
  but whether the image of impartiality was destroyed: see for example Shoppers 
  Mortgage &amp; Loan Corp. v. Health First Wellington Square Ltd. (1995), 23 
  O.R. (3d) 362 (C.A.). This is such a case.</p>
<p>
  [14] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below 
  and direct a new trial. The costs of the first trial are to be in the discretion 
  of the judge presiding at the new trial. The defendants are entitled to their 
  costs of this appeal, fixed at $10,000.00, all inclusive.</p>
