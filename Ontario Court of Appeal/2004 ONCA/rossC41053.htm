<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Mr. Ross pleaded guilty to two counts of impersonation, one count of fraud 
  over $5,000, and one count of failure to comply with a recognizance. Mr. Ross 
  admitted he proffered false identification to banks on two separate occasions 
  within a two-week period in an attempt to acquire funds. In addition to six 
  months credit for three months of pre-trial custody, the trial judge sentenced 
  Mr. Ross to a fourteen-month jail term and eighteen months probation. Mr. Ross 
  appeals his sentence, having abandoned his conviction appeal.</p>
<p>
  [2] In the first offence, Mr. Ross presented false identification to a bank 
  in an attempt to obtain $9,700 (Canadian) and $3,000 (American). Two weeks later, 
  when on bail for the first offence, Mr. Ross attempted to obtain a $50,000 personal 
  line of credit from another bank, again using false identification.</p>
<p>
  [3] Before this court, Mr. Ross provided fresh evidence, which was admitted 
  on consent, indicating that he was under treatment for a serious infectious 
  disease.</p>
<p>
  [4] Two issues arise on appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Is the sentence demonstrably unfit?</p>
<p class="indent">2. Does the fresh evidence provide grounds to vary the sentence?</p>
<p>1. The fitness of the sentence </p>
<p>
  [5] In fixing a fourteen-month jail term, the sentencing judge considered the 
  Crown submission for a two-year sentence and the defence submission for a six-month 
  sentence, both in addition to time served.</p>
<p>
  [6] The sentencing judge considered Mr. Ross' criminal record. His last conviction, 
  in 1999, was for a drinking and driving offence. In addition to a 1998 twelve-month 
  conditional sentence for his conviction on charges of false pretences, theft, 
  and possession of stolen property, Mr. Ross had a 1997 eighteen-month sentence 
  for break and enter. He had also received probation and a fine for a 1994 fraud 
  conviction.</p>
<p>
  [7] The Crown took the position at trial that, given the prior sentence of eighteen 
  months, Mr. Ross should receive a somewhat longer sentence for these offences. 
  It proposed that a sentence of two years imprisonment should be imposed, after 
  credit on a two-for-one basis for Mr. Ross' three months pre-trial custody.</p>
<p>
  [8] When his counsel was making submissions on the appropriate length of his 
  jail term, Mr. Ross intervened. He pointed out to the judge that he had not 
  actually obtained any money from either bank, and that other people who committed 
  similar offences received lighter sentences. He also pointed out that it had 
  been four years since his last criminal conviction, and that he had shown remorse 
  by pleading guilty. Finally, Mr. Ross told the judge that "the Crown&#133;told 
  me that [after] three months [of pre-trial custody] I could get time served."</p>
<p>
  [9] After taking into consideration the gap in Mr. Ross' criminal record from 
  1999 to 2003, and the fact that Mr. Ross had spent much of his three-month pre-trial 
  custody in lockdown, the sentencing judge determined that his sentence should 
  be less then a maximum reformatory term. However, he considered the "aggravating 
  circumstances here that he committed the second offence, the $50,000 attempt 
  fraud, directly in the face of the bail release order that prohibited him from 
  having these phony identification documents in his possession". The trial 
  judge concluded: "So I'm going to sentence him to fourteen months then 
  in the reformatory. Having given him credit for three months he's already spent 
  on a two-for-one basis, to reduce it from a maximum reformatory sentence to 
  fourteen months." In imposing this sentence, the judge appears to have 
  made an arithmetical error in Mr. Ross' favour by deducting six months from 
  twenty months, rather than from twenty-four months, with the result that fourteen 
  months imprisonment was imposed although the trial judge apparently intended 
  to impose eighteen months imprisonment.</p>
<p>
  [10] In the circumstances of Mr. Ross' record, and the aggravating factor of 
  committing the second offence while on bail for the first, there is no basis 
  for the assertion that this sentence is demonstrably unfit. </p>
<p>
  2. The fresh evidence</p>
<p>
  [11] Mr. Ross asked to have his sentence reduced to time served on the basis 
  of the fresh evidence, admitted on consent, that he is now under medical treatment 
  for a serious infectious disease. The fresh evidence consists of letters written 
  on Mr. Ross' behalf to the Ontario Parole and Earned Release Board, including 
  a letter from a doctor at the institution where he is incarcerated. At their 
  highest, those letters recommend that Mr. Ross be granted parole "so that 
  the continuity of his treatment with&#133;[his doctor] may be kept." </p>
<p>
  [12] There is no evidence, however, that Mr. Ross is not now receiving adequate 
  medical treatment. Indeed, there is an obligation on the institution to provide 
  such treatment, an obligation it must meet. </p>
<p>
  [13] On the evidence before us, we are not prepared to reduce Mr. Ross' sentence. 
  His parole application will come before the Parole Board next month. Given the 
  support for that application by the institution where he is incarcerated, Mr. 
  Ross may well be granted parole. We proceed on the assumption that the Parole 
  Board would exercise compassion, if appropriate.</p>
<p>
  [14] Accordingly, leave to appeal the sentence is granted, but the appeal is 
  dismissed.</p>
