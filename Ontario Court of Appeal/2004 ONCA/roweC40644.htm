<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The issue in this appeal is whether Ontario has jurisdiction to hear a 
  wrongful dismissal action brought by a federal employee.</p>
<p>
  [2] Kenneth Rowe was employed by the Department of National Defence as a facilities 
  manager for the Canadian Forces Personnel Support Agency in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. 
  He complained of harassment by his supervisor. Despite an investigation in Saskatchewan 
  confirming the harassment, Mr. Rowe's employer decided not to terminate the 
  supervisor. Mr. Rowe grieved this decision and requested a transfer. When the 
  response to his grievance from the labour relations manager in Ottawa appeared 
  to be delayed, he resigned and moved back to Ontario, where he brought this 
  action against the Crown alleging that he had been constructively dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [3] The Crown brought a motion objecting to the jurisdiction of the Ontario 
  Superior Court. The motions judge concluded that Ontario had jurisdiction.</p>
<p>
  [4] Jurisdiction for claims against the Crown derives from the Crown Liability 
  and Proceedings Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50. Section 21(1) of this Act states: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In all cases where claim is made against the Crown, except where the Federal 
  Court has exclusive jurisdiction with respect to it, the superior court of the 
  province in which the claim arises has concurrent jurisdiction with respect 
  to the subject-matter of the claim [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[5] Both parties agree that the facts of this case are sufficient to grant 
  Saskatchewan jurisdiction. Mr. Rowe performed all his employment duties in Saskatchewan. 
  He experienced harassment at his workplace in Saskatchewan. The harassment investigation 
  and discipline proceedings took place in Saskatchewan. Saskatchewan is, therefore, 
  a "province in which the claim arises" in accordance with s. 21(1) 
  of the Act.</p>
<p>
  [6] The motions judge held that Ontario too has jurisdiction, since the claim 
  also arose out of events in Ontario. The basis for this jurisdiction was his 
  finding that the Ottawa labour relations manager's failure to respond to Mr. 
  Rowe's grievance "may be alleged to be one of the facts that give rise 
  to his claim."</p>
<p>
  [7] With great respect, we disagree. It cannot be said that this claim arose 
  in Ontario simply because one of its underlying facts took place here, although 
  the delay in getting a response from Ottawa may have been a factor that prompted 
  Mr. Rowe's resignation. The delay followed the events at Mr. Rowe's Saskatchewan 
  workplace that constitute the substance of his claim, which was related to his 
  harassment in Saskatchewan by his supervisor and the manner in which it was 
  handled there.</p>
<p>
  [8] Since Mr. Rowe's claim did not arise in Ontario, the Ontario Superior Court 
  of Justice has no jurisdiction to hear it.</p>
<p>
  [9] Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, set aside the motions judge's order 
  and dismiss the action, with costs fixed in the total amount of $2,000.</p>
