<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: April 8, 2004</p>
<p> [1] On March 10, 1998, the appellant was convicted of attempting to obstruct 
  justice following a trial before Forestell J. The trial judge found that in 
  the spring of 1996 the appellant, who was an inmate at the Niagara Detention 
  Centre, asked a fellow prisoner to intimidate Julie Diehle. Ms. Diehle had testified 
  at a hearing in 1994 at which the appellant had been declared a dangerous offender. 
  In the trial before Forestell J., the Crown alleged that the appellant had requested 
  that his fellow inmate, who was due to be released soon, deliver a message and 
  an object (the ace of spades, a "death card") to Ms. Diehle with a 
  view to discouraging her from testifying at the upcoming appeal relating to 
  the appellant's status as a dangerous offender. It was common ground at the 
  trial - indeed the Crown stipulated in particulars - that there would be no 
  witnesses, including Ms. Diehle, at the appeal hearing.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant appeals his conviction on two grounds: (1) the trial judge 
  erred in ruling that the offence of attempting to obstruct justice by intimidating 
  a witness from testifying in a proceeding could be made out where no witnesses 
  would be called; and (2) the trial judge misapprehended the evidence on crucial 
  points.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant was charged under s. 139(3)(a) of the Criminal Code:</p>
<p class="indent"> 139(3) &#133; every one shall be deemed wilfully to attempt 
  to obstruct &#133; the course of justice who in a judicial proceeding &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(a) &#133; attempts to dissuade a person by threats &#133; from 
  giving evidence;The appellant contends that since Ms. Diehle could not give 
  evidence at the dangerous offender appeal hearing, he could not be convicted 
  of attempting to obstruct justice. His conduct was an "imaginary crime": see 
  United States of America v. Dynar (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [4] We do not agree with this submission. The interpretation of s. 127 (now 
  s. 139) of the Code was considered by Goodridge C.J.N. in R. v. Hearn (1989), 
  48 C.C.C. (3d) 377 at 381 (Nfld. C.A.):</p>
<p class="indent"> The gravaman of the offence under s. 127 is the wilful attempt 
  to obstruct justice. It does not matter that the attempt is unsuccessful or, 
  even, that it does not have the potential for success. When there is a wilful 
  attempt, however misguided, to influence the outcome of a trial improperly the 
  offence is complete.</p>
<p>
  [5] Hearn was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada: (1990), 53 C.C.C. (3d) 
  352. The unanimous judgment of the court was delivered orally by Wilson J.:</p>
<p class="indent"> We are all of the view that this appeal which comes to us of 
  right must be dismissed for the reasons given by the Chief Justice of Newfoundland.</p>
<p>
  [6] There is nothing in Dynar that is inconsistent with Hearn. Indeed, although 
  the court in Dynar considered and cited about 50 cases, Hearn was not one of 
  them. Dynar is a case dealing with the mens rea for attempt offences, which 
  is not in issue in this appeal, whereas Hearn deals with the actus reus for 
  the specific offence of attempt to obstruct justice. Hearn governs this appeal. 
  It was, therefore, open to the trial judge to convict the appellant for this 
  offence even though the subject of his attempt, Ms. Diehle, could not testify 
  at an appeal hearing.</p>
<p>
  [7] Finally, on this issue, we observe that we see no conflict between Hearn 
  and R. v. Graham (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 210 (Ont. C.A.), aff'd [1988] 1 S.C.R. 
  214.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant's second ground of appeal is that the trial judge misapprehended 
  crucial aspects of the evidence, in particular (1) he erroneously stated that 
  the appellant denied writing personal information about Ms. Diehle on a piece 
  of paper; and (2) he failed to give proper effect to the implausibility of the 
  appellant asking his fellow inmate to assist him in threatening Ms. Diehle.</p>
<p>
  [9] We disagree. The trial judge's conclusion about the appellant's denial of 
  authorship of the information on the paper is supportable on the record. Moreover, 
  the trial judge carefully assessed the credibility of the fellow inmate's testimony 
  against the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
