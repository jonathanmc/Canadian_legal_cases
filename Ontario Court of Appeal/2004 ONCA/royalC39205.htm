<p>On appeal from the judgment of Herman J. Wilton-Siegel of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated November 1, 2002, reported at (2002) 43 C.C.L.I. 274.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J. A.: </p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [1] A fire of undetermined origin destroyed a home near London, Ontario in April 
  2000. The respondents, Royal Bank of Canada ("Royal Bank") and Michael 
  Alexander ("Alexander") held mortgages on the property and claimed 
  under the provisions of a fire insurance policy issued by the appellant, State 
  Farm Fire and Casualty Company ("State Farm").</p>
<p>
  [2] State Farm acknowledged that the Royal Bank and Alexander were insured under 
  the policy but took the position that coverage was voided as of January 2000. 
  State Farm contended that the house had been vacated in November 1999 and remained 
  vacant, to the knowledge of the mortgagees, when the fire occurred. State Farm 
  further took the position that the vacancy constituted a material change in 
  risk which was not disclosed to State Farm and entitled State Farm to void the 
  policy. The Royal Bank and Alexander sued State Farm in separate actions.</p>
<p> [3] All parties moved for summary judgment. The outcome of the motions turned 
  on the proper interpretation of three provisions in the policy: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the mortgage clause which applies to mortgagees who are insured under the 
    policy;</li>
  <li>the vacancy exclusion which excludes liability for damage caused after the 
    property has been vacated for more than thirty days; and</li>
  <li>Statutory Condition Number 4 ("Statutory Condition"), which refers 
    to material changes to the insured risk and entitles the insurer to void or 
    cancel the policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [4] Wilton-Siegel J. held that the mortgage clause and the Statutory Condition 
  were part of the contract between State Farm and the mortgagees. He held, however, 
  that in the circumstances the insurer could not rely on the Statutory Condition 
  to void coverage under the policy. Wilton-Siegel J. further held that the vacancy 
  exclusion in the policy was inconsistent with the terms of the mortgage clause 
  and could not be applied against the mortgagee. He gave judgment for the respondents. 
  State Farm appealed.</p>
<p>
  [5] I would allow the appeal and dismiss both actions. I agree with the motion 
  judge that State Farm could not rely on the vacancy exclusion to refuse payment 
  on the policy. I would, however, hold that the Statutory Condition did apply 
  and in the circumstances, entitled State Farm to void the contract. </p>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  [6] A brief summary of the agreed statement of facts relied on at the motion 
  will suffice for the purposes of appeal. The house, which burned down in April 
  2000, was purchased by the Deeks in March 1997 and placed in the name of Julaine 
  Deeks. She and her husband lived in the house. In December 1997, the Royal Bank 
  registered a first mortgage against the property. In March 1998, Alexander registered 
  a second mortgage against the property.</p>
<p>
  [7] The home was insured against fire by the Deeks under a policy issued by 
  State Farm. Royal Bank and Alexander, as mortgagees were named insured under 
  that policy.</p>
<p>
  [8] The Deeks defaulted on both mortgages in June 1999. Alexander commenced 
  power of sale proceedings in August 1999. In September 1999, both mortgages 
  remained in default and Julaine Deeks moved out of the house. Todd Deeks continued 
  to live in the house. The Royal Bank commenced foreclosure proceedings on October 
  14, 1999. It retained a company to inspect the property on a weekly basis. Mr. 
  Deeks was living in the house as of November 12, 1999, but had vacated the property 
  permanently by November 19, 1999.</p>
<p>
  [9] On about November 20, 1999, the Royal Bank gave instructions to change the 
  locks on all the doors and directed that steps be taken to preserve the property 
  while it was vacant. The plumbing was drained, utilities were rerouted, and 
  the hot water tank was emptied and turned off. </p>
<p>
  [10] On November 26, 1999, Alexander brought the Royal Bank's first mortgage 
  into good standing thereby taking control of the power of sale proceedings. 
  He continued to make payments on the first mortgage until the fire. From November 
  26th until the date of the fire Alexander was in control of the property and 
  the Royal Bank had no involvement with it. Alexander retained real estate agents 
  to list and sell the property. The property remained vacant.</p>
<p>
  [11] At no time after November 20, 1999 and before the fire on April 16, 2000 
  did the Royal Bank, Alexander or anyone else tell State Farm that the Deeks 
  had moved out of the property. State Farm was not told that the house was vacant, 
  that the mortgagees had taken control of the property by retaining the only 
  set of keys to the property or that power of sale proceedings had been commenced.</p>
<p>
  [12] Alexander's lawyer advised State Farm of the fire on April 18, 2000. In 
  the summer of 2000 Royal Bank and Alexander made claims under the policy. In 
  March 2001 State Farm advised the Royal Bank and Alexander that no payment would 
  be made as in State Farm's view the policy had been voided effective January 
  7, 2000. State Farm took the position that material changes in the insured risk 
  had occurred and that it had not received notice of those changes. State Farm's 
  letter said in part: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The insured risk became vacant on or about November 20, 1999. The Royal Bank 
  assumed control of the property. Neither of these facts, nor the subsequent 
  change of interest to Michael Alexander, were made known to State Farm.&#133;</p>
<p>
  [13] It was agreed by the parties that "this factual situation would have 
  caused any other similar insurer to either cancel its policy or increase the 
  premium charged".</p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  [14] The relevant parts of the policy are set out below: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Vacancy Exclusion</p>
<p class="indent"> We do not insure: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1. Loss or damage occurring after your dwelling has been vacated for more than 
  thirty consecutive days&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent"> Statutory Condition Number 4</p>
<p class="indent"> Any change material to the risk and within the control and 
  knowledge of the insured voids the contract as to the part affected thereby, 
  unless the change is properly notified in writing to the insurer or its local 
  agent, and the insurer when so notified may return the unearned portion, if 
  any, of the premium paid and cancel the contract, or may notify the insured 
  in writing that, if he desires the contract to continue in force, he must, within 
  15 days of the receipt of notice, pay to the insurer an additional premium and 
  in default of such premium, the contract is no longer in force.</p>
<p class="indent"> Mortgage Clause</p>
<p class="indent"> This insurance and every documented renewal thereof - AS TO 
  THE INTEREST OF THE MORTGAGEE ONLY THEREIN - is and shall be in force notwithstanding 
  any act, neglect, omission or misrepresentation attributable to the mortgagor, 
  owner or occupant of the property insured, including transfer of interest, any 
  vacancy or non-occupancy, or the occupation of the property for purposes more 
  hazardous than specified in the description of the risk; PROVIDED ALWAYS that 
  the Mortgagee shall notify forthwith the Insurer (if known) of any vacancy or 
  non-occupancy extending beyond thirty (30) consecutive days, or of any transfer 
  of interest or increased hazard THAT SHALL COME TO HIS KNOWLEDGE; and that every 
  increase of hazard (not permitted by the Policy) shall be paid for by the Mortgagee 
  - on reasonable demand - from the date such hazard existed, according to the 
  established scale of rates for the acceptance of such increased hazard, during 
  the continuance of this insurance. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> &#133; The term of this mortgage clause coincides with the 
  term of the Policy, PROVIDED ALWAYS that the Insurer reserves the right to cancel 
  the Policy as provided by Statutory provision but agrees that the Insurer will 
  neither terminate nor alter the Policy to the prejudice of the Mortgagee without 
  the notice stipulated in such Statutory provision.</p>
<p class="indent"> Should title or ownership to said property become vested in 
  the Mortgagee and/or assigns as owner or purchaser under foreclosure or otherwise, 
  this insurance shall continue until expiry or cancellation for the benefit of 
  the said Mortgagee and/or assigns.</p>
<p class="indent"> SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS MORTGAGE CLAUSE (and these shall 
  supersede any policy provisions in conflict therewith BUT ONLY TO THE INTEREST 
  OF THE MORTGAGEE), loss under this Policy is made payable to the Mortgagee [emphasis 
  added].</p>
<p>
  [15] The Statutory Condition is part of every fire insurance policy by virtue 
  of s. 148(1) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8. The vacancy exclusion 
  and the mortgage clause are written into the policy by the insurer. They are 
  standard provisions that have been in residential fire insurance polices for 
  many years.</p>
<p>
  [16] The mortgage clause creates a contract between the mortgagee and the insurer. 
  That contract is said to be "engrafted" on to the contract between 
  the mortgagor and the insurer, but is distinct from that contract: National 
  Bank of Greece (Canada) v. Katsikonouris, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1029 at 1036-1037; 
  London Loan and Savings Co. of Canada v. Union Insurance Co. of Canton Ltd. 
  (1925), 4 D.L.R. 676 at 679 (Ont. H.C.) aff'd [1925] 4 D.L.R. 680 (Ont. C.A.). 
  By its terms the mortgage clause insulates the mortgagee from conduct of the 
  mortgagor which would vitiate coverage under the policy: National Bank of Greece 
  (Canada), supra, at p. 1047. The mortgage clause does not however constitute 
  the entire contract between the mortgagees and the insurer. The terms and conditions 
  of the rest of the policy apply for or against the mortgagee except to the extent 
  that those provisions are not inconsistent with the terms of the mortgage clause: 
  Royal Bank of Canada v. Red River Valley Mutual Insurance Co. (1986), 42 Man. 
  R. (2d) 124 at 130-31 (C.A.). The primacy of the terms of the mortgage clause 
  over the other terms and conditions of the policy is made explicit by the closing 
  words of the mortgage clause which provide that its terms "supersede any 
  policy provisions in conflict": See Economical Mutual Insurance Co. v. 
  State Farm Insurance Co., [1999] O.J. No. 3885 at para. 8, 9 (Gen. Div.).</p>
<p>
  [17] In fleshing out the terms of the contract between the mortgagees and the 
  insurer I begin with the language of the mortgage clause. As Laforest J. observed 
  in National Bank of Greece (Canada), supra, at p. 1043, the clause should be 
  read as it would be "understood by an average person applying for insurance". 
  To assist in interpreting the relevant part of the mortgage clause I break it 
  into three parts. The first part reads: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This insurance and every documented renewal thereof - as to the interest of 
  the mortgagee only therein - is and shall be enforced notwithstanding any act, 
  neglect, omission or misrepresentation attributable to the Mortgagor, owner 
  or occupant of the property insured, including transfer of interest, any vacancy 
  or non-occupancy, or the occupation of the property for purposes more hazardous 
  than specified in the description of the risk. [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [18] The opening part of the mortgage clause declares that the contract between 
  the mortgagee and the insurer remains in effect regardless of conduct by the 
  mortgagor which would entitle the insurer to void the contract as between the 
  mortgagor and the insurer. In short, the insurer cannot rely on the conduct 
  of the mortgagor to void the policy against the mortgagee.</p>
<p>
  [19] The second part of the mortgage clause reads: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Provided always that the mortgagee shall notify forthwith the insurer (if known) 
  of any vacancy or non-occupancy extending beyond thirty (30) consecutive days, 
  or of any transfer of interest or increased hazard that shall come to his knowledge; 
  &#133; [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [20] This part of the mortgage clause places an obligation on the mortgagee 
  to notify the insurer forthwith of the facts specified in the clause if they 
  come to the knowledge of the mortgagee.</p>
<p>
  [21] The third part of the mortgage clause provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; every increase of hazard (not permitted by the Policy) shall be paid 
  for by the Mortgagee - on reasonable demand - from the date such hazard existed, 
  according to the established scale of rates for the acceptance of such increased 
  hazard, during the continuance of this insurance. [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  This provision requires the mortgagee to pay, on reasonable demand, increases 
  in the premiums resulting from increases in the hazard.</p>
<p>
  [22] As I read the mortgage clause, it does not void coverage against the mortgagee 
  where the mortgagor has vacated the property and the mortgagee has become aware 
  that the property is vacant. Instead, the mortgage clause places an obligation 
  on the mortgagee to notify the insurer of the vacancy and pay any increased 
  premiums that flow as a result of the vacancy.</p>
<p> [23] My analysis of the interaction between the vacancy exclusion and the 
  mortgage clause tracks that of the motion judge. He held (at p. 290) that the 
  automatic exclusion from coverage provided in the vacancy exclusion term in 
  the policy was inconsistent with the terms of the mortgage clause and therefore, 
  could not be applied against the mortgagee. Mr. Zarek, in his well-crafted submissions 
  for State Farm, placed heavy reliance on the contrary decision of the Quebec 
  Court of Appeal in American Home Assurance Co. v. Axa Assurances Inc., [2002] 
  J.Q. No. 343 (C.A.)<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>. American Home Assurance 
  Co. was released a few months before this motion was heard and was not brought 
  to the attention of the motion judge.</p>
<p>
  [24] In American Home Assurance Co. the court held on facts which are similar 
  to the facts of this case that the exclusion clause could be enforced against 
  a mortgagee when the mortgagee had taken possession of the insured property, 
  knew that the mortgagor had vacated the property, and did not notify the insurer. 
  The essence of the court's reasoning is set out below: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [20] From the time that the mortgagee took possession of the building to manage 
  it and was informed that it was vacant, it was the mortgagee, and no longer 
  the mortgagor that bore the risk for it. In other words, it was the mortgagee 
  that was responsible for it or had control of whether the building was vacant. 
  If the vacancy continues for more than 30 days, the exclusionary clause in the 
  contract takes effect.</p>
<p>
  [21] The first sentence of the mortgage clause provides that the insurance contract 
  continues in force even if the insured contributes to an increase in the risk. 
  The second sentence adds a qualifier by requiring that the mortgagee inform 
  the insurer of the situation upon becoming aware of it.</p>
<p>
  [22] It follow that, if the mortgagee does not inform the insurer of the increase 
  in risk that it bears, the protection of the mortgage clause is no longer in 
  force.</p>
<p>
  [23] This appears to me to be the only interpretation that allows us to reconcile 
  the terms of the insurance contract, which excludes the risk related to the 
  vacancy of the building, with the mortgage clause, which preserves the insurance 
  if the insured contributes to an increase in the risk.</p>
<p>
  [24] The second part of the mortgage clause is really an obligation for the 
  insurer to refrain from using actions attributable to the insured against the 
  mortgagee if the mortgagee does not know of them. In this case, the insurer 
  is required to indemnify the risk that it excluded or that could result in the 
  cancellation of the contract, but the insurer can obtain an increase in the 
  premiums. (article 2488 C.c.B.C.)</p>
<p>
  [25] I do not agree with the reasoning in American Home Assurance Co. The assertion 
  in para. 20 of American Home Assurance Co. that the mortgagee assumed the risk 
  is a conclusary statement that must be tested against the terms of the mortgage 
  clause. I also cannot agree, as set out in para. 22 of the judgment, that it 
  flows from the mortgagee's failure to notify the insurer as required, that the 
  insurer must loose the protection of the mortgage clause. The effect of failing 
  to give the required notice must depend on the language of the mortgage clause. 
  Nothing in the mortgage clause suggests that the failure to give the required 
  notice triggers the exclusionary clauses against the mortgagee. The mortgage 
  clause speaks only of an entitlement to increased premiums. The court, in American 
  Home Assurance Co. at para. 23 also speaks of "reconciling" the insurance 
  contract and the mortgage clause. This approach suggests that the two must be 
  read together and harmonized. As I read the mortgage clause it is trump where 
  there is an inconsistency between its terms and the rest of the policy.</p>
<p>
  [26] The court, in American Home Assurance Co., supra, at para. 25 also relied 
  on the judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Royal Bank of Canada v. Red 
  River Valley Mutual Insurance Co., supra. That case, however, did not hold that 
  the vacancy exclusion in the policy applied against the mortgagee. Rather, the 
  court held that the mortgagee was subject to the terms of Statutory Condition 
  Number 4 if there was a material change in the insured risk that was within 
  the control and knowledge of the mortgagee.</p>
<p>
  [27] In summary, I prefer the motion judge's analysis of the mortgage clause 
  and the vacancy exclusion to that of the court in American Home Assurance Co. 
  His reasoning is consistent with a formidable line of authority: London Loan 
  and Saving Co. of Canada v. Union Insurance Co. of Canton Ltd., supra; Royal 
  Insurance Co. of Canada v. Gordon (1981), 125 D.L.R. (3d) 372 (N. S. C.A.) affg 
  (1980) 40 N.S.R. (2d) 259 (N.S.S.C.); Citicorp Realty Ltd. v. Zurich Insurance 
  Co. (1983), 1 C.C.L.I. 222 (Ont. Cty. Ct.); Montreal Trust Co. v. Dominion of 
  Canada General Insurance Co. (1987), 46 R.P.R. 102 (Ont. H.C.).</p>
<p>
  [28] Having concluded that the motion judge correctly held that the vacancy 
  exclusion did not apply to the mortgagee I turn to Statutory Condition Number 
  4. That Condition requires an insured, which includes a mortgagee, to notify 
  the insurer of any change "within the control and knowledge of the insured" 
  that is material to the risk. A change is material if it increases the risk 
  insured. Failure to give the required notice voids the contract. If notice is 
  given, the insurer has an option as to whether to continue coverage: Yorkshire 
  Trust Co. v. Laurentian Pacific Insurance Co. (1987), 28 C.C.L.I. 368 at 374-76 
  (B.C. S.C.); Royal Bank of Canada v. Red River Valley Mutual Insurance Co., 
  supra, at 307. It is important to appreciate that while the mortgage clause 
  protects the mortgagee against the misdeeds of the mortgagor, Statutory Condition 
  Number 4 makes the mortgagee, as an insured, responsible for increases in the 
  risk flowing from the mortgagee's own conduct. If the material change in the 
  risk is "within the control and knowledge" of the mortgagee, Statutory 
  Condition Number 4 makes the mortgagee responsible to notify the insurer of 
  that change failing which, the contract between the mortgagee and the insurer 
  is void.</p>
<p>
  [29] The motion judge concluded that there was no inconsistency between the 
  terms of the mortgage clause and Statutory Condition Number 4. Both were properly 
  considered part of the contract between the insurer and the mortgagees: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; [T]he mortgage clause and the statutory condition coexist, with the mortgage 
  clause setting out the general remedy of available to the insurer in the event 
  the mortgagee receives knowledge of, and fails to give notice of, any of the 
  enumerated changes to the risk and the statutory condition provided an additional 
  remedy of a right to void the policy where the particular change to the risk 
  was within the control as well as the knowledge of the mortgagee. [p. 289]</p>
<p>
  [30] The motion judge's conclusion is consistent with Royal Bank of Canada v. 
  Red River Valley Mutual Insurance Co., supra, and Royal Bank of Canada v. Safeco 
  Insurance Co. (1988), 85 A.R. 357 at 362-63 (Alta. Q.B.). Counsel for the respondent, 
  Alexander also conceded that there was no inherent inconsistency between the 
  mortgage clause and Statutory Condition Number 4. Counsel for Royal Bank argued 
  that there was an inconsistency between the two.</p>
<p>
  [31] I think the motion judge is correct. The mortgage clause is concerned with 
  conduct of the mortgagor and the mortgagee's obligations if and when that conduct 
  comes to the attention of the mortgagee. Statutory Condition Number 4 is concerned 
  with the conduct of insured, including insured who are mortgagees. It addresses 
  the consequences of the mortgagee's actions which materially increase the insured 
  risk. </p>
<p>
  [32] The motion judge's determination that Statutory Condition Number 4 was 
  part of the contract between the mortgagee and the insurer led to the final 
  question - did it apply in these circumstances to void the policy? To answer 
  that question, the motion judge had to identify the material change in risk, 
  and decide whether that change was "within the control and knowledge" 
  of the mortgagees. The motion judge found that the material change in risk occurred 
  when Mr. Deeks vacated the residence on or about November 20. He further held, 
  at p. 288, that this change could be said to be within the "control" 
  of the mortgagee only if "the mortgagee is in a position to reverse the 
  change in the risk which occurred on the vacancy of the property". He concluded 
  that the mortgagees did not have the requisite control: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; It cannot be said that the mortgagees caused the vacancy, much less could 
  restore the property to the original level of risk, as only occupation by a 
  mortgagor having an interest in the property would satisfy this test and the 
  default of the mortgagees under the mortgage made this unattainable. On this 
  view, it is only after completion of foreclosure proceedings, when title is 
  acquired by the mortgagee, that notice must be given to avoid the risk of avoidance 
  of the policy. [p. 288] [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [33] When the owners vacated the property, the insured risk increased. I agree 
  that the mortgagees cannot be said to have had any control over the mortgagor's 
  vacating of the property. I cannot agree however, that the concept of "control" 
  in Statutory Condition Number 4 as applied to mortgagees is limited to situations 
  in which the mortgagee is able to "restore the property to the original 
  level of risk".</p>
<p>
  [34] Statutory Condition Number 4 is directed at any material increase in the 
  risk. I take risk to mean the risk which the insured agreed to insure when it 
  entered into the contract. The Statutory Condition makes any insured responsible 
  for any material increase in the risk that is "within the control and knowledge" 
  of that insured. If the conduct of the mortgagee materially increases the risk 
  from that which the insurer agreed to insure, I think the Statutory Condition 
  applies to void the policy unless notice is given to the insurer. The operation 
  of Statutory Condition Number 4 against the mortgagee does not depend either 
  on the conduct of the mortgagor, or the mortgagee's ability to undo a risk created 
  by the conduct of the mortgagor. The motion judge misdirected the inquiry when 
  he looked to whether the mortgagees could "restore the property to the 
  original level of risk". He should have asked himself whether the actions 
  of the mortgagees materially increased the risk from that which State Farm had 
  agreed to insure when it entered into the policy.</p>
<p>
  [35] The Royal Bank on November 20, and Alexander after he brought the second 
  mortgage into good standing, effectively took possession and control of the 
  property. They controlled the property and took steps to keep it vacant and 
  preserve the property until it could be sold. In doing so they acted as prudent 
  mortgagees and no doubt reduced the risk that existed when the property was 
  left vacant and unattended by the owners. For the purposes of Statutory Condition 
  Number 4 however, the correct comparison is not between the level of risk after 
  the mortgagor left the property, but rather must be with the level of risk State 
  Farm agreed to insure. State Farm insured a residence occupied by its owner. 
  As of November 20, 1999, the house was vacant and in the exclusive possession 
  and control of the mortgagees. Both the continued vacancy after November 20 
  and the effective possession and control of the property by the mortgagees after 
  that date were "within the control and knowledge" of the mortgagees 
  and materially increased the risk when compared to the risk State Farm had agreed 
  to insure. Statutory Condition Number 4 required that the mortgagees give notice

  [36] I would allow the appeal, set aside the orders below and in their place 
  grant judgment to State Farm dismissing both actions. The appellant is entitled 
  to its costs of the motion below on a partial indemnity basis to be assessed 
  if they cannot be agreed upon. The appellant should have costs against the Royal 
  Bank in the amount of $3500 in this court and costs against Alexander in the 
  same amount.</p>
