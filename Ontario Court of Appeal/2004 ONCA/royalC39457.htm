<p>On appeal from the order of Justice James M. Farley of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated January 16, 2003, reported at (2003) 40 C.B.R. (4th) 146.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] On January 10, 2003, a large group of related companies collectively known 
  as The Royal Crest Lifecare Group Inc. ("Royal Crest"), which operated 
  five nursing homes, six retirement homes and six mixed care (nursing and retirement) 
  homes in southern Ontario, was petitioned into bankruptcy by several banks after 
  it defaulted under its loan agreements with the banks. Ernst &amp; Young Inc. 
  ("Ernst &amp; Young") was appointed as trustee of the estate of the 
  bankrupt.</p>
<p>
  [2] On the same day, and before the same judge, Farley J., who made the bankruptcy 
  order, the trustee and the unions representing many of the employees of the 
  bankrupt company brought duelling motions.</p>
<p>
  [3] The trustee sought an order that it not be bound by the collective agreements 
  between Royal Crest and the unions and that it not be deemed to be a successor 
  employer under the Labour Relations Act, 1995, S.O. 1995, c. 1, Sch. A. (the 
  "LRA"), and other labour and employment laws.</p>
<p>
  [4] The unions resisted the trustee's motion. In addition, based on their view 
  that the question of 'successor employer' came within the exclusive jurisdiction 
  of the Ontario Labour Relations Board (the "OLRB"), the unions made 
  a cross-motion before the bankruptcy judge. In their cross-motion, the unions 
  sought leave, pursuant to s. 215 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 
  1985, c. B-3 (the "BIA"), to pursue an application before the OLRB 
  seeking the designation of the trustee as a successor employer.</p>
<p>
  [5] The bankruptcy judge dismissed the trustee's motion. The trustee does not 
  appeal.</p>
<p>
  [6] The bankruptcy judge also dismissed the unions' cross-motion, but "without 
  prejudice to such a motion being brought back on again with appropriate factual 
  underpinning". The unions appeal.</p>
<p>
  B. THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  (1) The parties and the events</p>
<p>
  [7] Royal Crest operated 17 long-term care facilities in Southern Ontario. These 
  homes provided approximately 2300 beds for patients and residents. Royal Crest 
  employed about 2200 full-time and part-time employees. Canadian Union of Public 
  Employees Locals 1712, 3009, 2225-05, 2225-06 and 2225-12 and Service Employees 
  International Union Locals 204 and 532 (the "unions") represent approximately 
  1400 of these employees.</p>
<p>
  [8] Unfortunately, by late 2002 Royal Crest was in serious financial difficulty. 
  It owed its creditors, mostly banks, in excess of $128 million and was in default 
  under its loan agreements.</p>
<p>
  [9] On October 21, 2002, Royal Crest was granted protection under the Companies 
  Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 (the "CCAA") by order 
  of Crane J. On November 13, 2002, the proceedings under the CCAA were terminated 
  and Ernst &amp; Young was appointed as interim receiver pursuant to s. 46 of 
  the BIA. The interim receiver immediately engaged the former employees under 
  terms and conditions of employment similar, but not identical, to those provided 
  in the various collective agreements. One of the terms of employment to which 
  the employees had to agree was that they accepted that Ernst &amp; Young was 
  not a successor employer.</p>
<p>
  [10] On January 10, 2003, Royal Crest was petitioned into bankruptcy. Ernst 
  &amp; Young was appointed as trustee. </p>
<p>
  (2) The litigation</p>
<p>
  (a) Before the bankruptcy judge</p>
<p>
  [11] On January 10, 2003, the trustee and the unions brought their duelling 
  or mirror motions on the question of whether the trustee should be deemed to 
  be a successor employer within the meaning of s. 69 of the LRA.</p>
<p>
  [12] The bankruptcy judge dismissed the trustee's motion. He reviewed considerable 
  case law, much of it conflicting. It seems clear from his reasons that he doubted 
  two of the propositions advanced by the trustee: (1) a trustee in bankruptcy 
  cannot be a successor employer; and (2) collective agreements terminate with 
  bankruptcy. All that the bankruptcy judge was prepared to order, consistent 
  with Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd., [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, was: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This Court orders that the employment of all employees engaged by the Interim 
  Receiver is terminated by virtue of the bankruptcy. The Trustee is hereby authorized 
  to engage any or all of such former employees of the Bankrupt or any other persons.</p>
<p>
  The trustee does not appeal this component of the bankruptcy judge's order.</p>
<p>
  [13] The bankruptcy judge also dismissed the unions' cross-motion. Again, the 
  bankruptcy judge conducted a full review of the relevant legislation and case 
  law. He concluded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There has been no allegation, let alone evidence, that the Trustee here (even 
  if one were to consider E &amp; Y Inc. in its capacity as IR) has been dragging 
  its feet or will do so. The CUPE cross-motion for leave is dismissed without 
  prejudice to such a motion being brought back on again with appropriate factual 
  underpinning which I would be of the view ought to demonstrate that the Trustee 
  has slipped over from functioning qua realizor of assets in a diligent fashion 
  to the role of being predominantly an employer in its activities.</p>
<p>
  The unions appeal the bankruptcy judge's decision relating to their cross-motion.</p>
<p>
  (b) The appeal</p>
<p>
  [14] The appeal is unusual in an important respect. Most appeals involve the 
  same parties, issues and arguments that were before the trial, application or 
  motion judge. To some extent, that is true of this appeal. Some of the matters 
  that were before the bankruptcy judge, and which he resolved, are raised again 
  on appeal.</p>
<p>
  [15] However, significant attention was devoted on the appeal (in facta and 
  in oral argument) to an issue that was invisible, or almost invisible, in the 
  hearing before the bankruptcy judge. The issue is the relationship, in constitutional 
  law terms, between the federal BIA and the Ontario LRA.</p>
<p>
  [16] The appellants raised the purported constitutional issue in their factum 
  by framing the first issue of the appeal as: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (a) Did the learned bankruptcy judge err in effectively finding a conflict between 
  the provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and the Labour Relations 
  Act, 1995, where none in fact exists?</p>
<p>
  [17] Rather than ignore the fact that the appellants' argument appeared to be 
  put no higher than the assertion that the bankruptcy judge had made an implicit 
  determination of a constitutional issue raised by no one, the respondent trustee 
  decided to mount a full-scale attack on the applicability of the successor employer 
  provisions of the LRA in a bankruptcy context. The trustee served a Notice of 
  Constitutional Question upon the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney 
  General of Ontario, pursuant to s. 109 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. C.43.</p>
<p>
  [18] The Attorney General of Ontario intervened in the appeal. He noted that 
  no Notice of Constitutional Question was served in the proceedings before the 
  bankruptcy judge and, consequently, he had no opportunity to participate in 
  those proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [19] During the appeal hearing, the panel permitted the appellants and the trustee 
  to make their constitutional arguments. However, at the conclusion of these 
  submissions, the panel indicated that it did not need to hear further submissions 
  on this issue, including submissions from the Attorney General who had filed 
  an extensive factum on the purported constitutional issue. The panel essentially 
  agreed with the Attorney General's submissions that: (1) the constitutional 
  issue was not raised before, or addressed or determined by, the bankruptcy judge; 
  and (2) the appeal could, and should, be determined without the necessity of 
  dealing with the constitutional issue.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUE</p>
<p>
  [20] The sole issue on the appeal is whether the bankruptcy judge erred in the 
  exercise of his discretion by refusing to permit the unions to proceed, on January 
  10, 2003, to the OLRB to have the question of the status of the trustee as successor 
  employer resolved.</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) The standard of review</p>
<p>
  [21] A bankruptcy is a disaster. A company has failed; in many cases it will 
  not survive. Creditors, who provided goods and services in good faith, may lose 
  substantial sums of money. Employees of the bankrupt company instantly lose 
  their jobs.</p>
<p>
  [22] The bankruptcy judge is thrown into the middle of the disaster. The judge 
  will need to make important decisions that will affect the future of the company, 
  creditors and employees. The qualities of a good bankruptcy judge are therefore 
  expertise, sensitivity and speed.</p>
<p>
  [23] Appellate courts have long recognized the unique difficulties faced by 
  judges in bankruptcy and CCAA proceedings. The result is that appellate courts 
  accord considerable deference to judges' decisions in these contexts: see, for 
  example, Re Algoma Steel Inc., [2001] O.J. No. 1943 (C.A.); Banque National 
  de Paris (Canada) v. Opiola, [2001] 6 W.W.R. 95 (Alta. C.A.); and Ford Credit 
  Canada Ltd. v. Fred Walls &amp; Sons Holdings Ltd., [2003] B.C.J. No. 454 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  (2) The test under s. 215 of the BIA</p>
<p>
  [24] The LRA gives the OLRB exclusive jurisdiction to decide successor employer 
  applications: see ss. 69(12), 114 and 116. However, in bankruptcy proceedings, 
  a party seeking to challenge a decision by a trustee must seek leave from a 
  judge. Section 215 of the BIA provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  215. Except by leave of the court, no action lies against &#133; a trustee with 
  respect to any report made under, or any action taken pursuant to, this Act.</p>
<p>
  The appellants acknowledge that they require the leave of the court in order 
  to pursue their application to the OLRB. </p>
<p>
  [25] The case law establishes that the threshold for granting leave under s. 
  215 of the BIA is a low one. In Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers 
  of Canada v. Armitage (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 688 at 690 (C.A.) ("SOCAN"), 
  Charron J.A. stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he evidence required to support an order under s. 215 must be sufficient 
  to establish that there is a factual basis for the proposed claim and that the 
  proposed claim discloses a cause of action. However, the evidence does not have 
  to be sufficient to enable the motions judge to make a final assessment of the 
  merits of the proposed claim. The sufficiency of the evidence must be measured 
  in the context of the purpose of s. 215 which is to prevent the trustee from 
  having to respond to actions which are frivolous or vexatious or which do not 
  disclose a cause of action&#133;.</p>
<p>
  See also: Mancini (Bankrupt) et al. v. Falconi et al. (1993), 61 O.A.C. 332 
  and Vanderwoude et al. v. Scott and Pichelli Ltd. et al. (2001), 143 O.A.C. 
  195.</p>
<p>
  (3) Discussion</p>
<p>
  [26] The appellants contend that the bankruptcy judge made three errors in his 
  reasons relating to their cross-motion: (1) he applied the wrong test for a 
  BIA s. 215 application; (2) he determined a matter - whether the trustee was 
  a successor employer - within the exclusive jurisdiction of the OLRB; and (3) 
  he incorrectly found that the various collective agreements were in "suspended 
  animation".</p>
<p>
  [27] I do not agree that the bankruptcy judge applied the wrong test. The cross-motion 
  was directly related to s. 215 of the BIA and the relevant case law was argued 
  before the bankruptcy judge. It is true that the test under s. 215 of the BIA 
  establishes a low threshold for granting leave. However, SOCAN makes it clear 
  that there must be an evidentiary basis for the proposed cause of action.</p>
<p>
  [28] The bankruptcy judge clearly turned his mind to this component of the test. 
  In dismissing the cross-motion, he invited the unions to bring a further motion 
  "with appropriate factual underpinning".</p>
<p>
  [29] It is important to place the appellants' cross-motion in its proper context. 
  Prior to January 10, 2003, there was no live successor employer issue because 
  Ernst &amp; Young, acting as interim receiver, engaged current employees only 
  if they contractually agreed that Ernst &amp; Young was not a successor employer. 
  On January 10, 2003, this picture changed in a major way. When receiving orders 
  were made and Ernst &amp; Young was appointed as trustee of the estate of Royal 
  Crest, the status of the trustee as a potential successor employer emerged as 
  a live issue because the existing employment relation was automatically terminated: 
  see Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd., supra. Both the trustee and the unions 
  decided, virtually instantaneously, to resort to their preferred institutions, 
  the court and the OLRB respectively, to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
  [30] It is clear that the bankruptcy judge regarded both motions as premature. 
  In my view, this conclusion was amply supported by the chronology of events 
  and the record before the bankruptcy judge.</p>
<p>
  [31] The trustee has many responsibilities - to the estate it is managing, to 
  creditors and to the court. Where, as here, a trustee in bankruptcy seeks to 
  hire former employees of the bankrupt company, the trustee also has a responsibility 
  to those employees. The trustee's decision to bring a motion on the first day 
  of its trusteeship seeking a declaration that it not be deemed a successor employer 
  "for any purpose whatsoever" was, in the bankruptcy judge's view, 
  premature. Accordingly, he dismissed the motion. The trustee does not appeal 
  this component of his decision.</p>
<p>
  [32] Equally, the appellants' cross-motion, understandable perhaps because of 
  the trustee's motion, was also, arguably, misconceived. The first day of a bankruptcy 
  is hardly 'business as usual' for anyone, including the employees. The relationship 
  between the trustee and the employees of the bankrupt company cannot be resolved 
  instantly. Care, sensitivity, negotiation and at least some time will be necessary 
  before an appropriate relationship can be set in place. The bankruptcy judge 
  regarded the union's cross-motion as premature as well. Accordingly, he dismissed 
  it, but without foreclosing the possibility that such a motion could succeed 
  once the parties, at a minimum, had explored the establishment of an appropriate 
  employment relationship. Again, I see no basis for interfering with the bankruptcy 
  judge's exercise of discretion in this regard.</p>
<p>
  [33] I also do not accept the appellants' submission that the bankruptcy judge 
  decided the successor employer issue. He explicitly did not do this. He dismissed 
  the trustee's motion seeking an order that the trustee not be deemed a successor 
  employer and authorized the trustee to engage former employees of the bankrupt 
  company. He also dismissed the unions' cross-motion, but coupled that dismissal 
  with an invitation to bring another motion later with an "appropriate factual 
  underpinning". In my view, these careful combined dispositions establish 
  clearly that the bankruptcy judge did not decide the successor employer issue 
  on its merits. Rather, he regarded resolution of that issue on January 10, 2003 
  as being premature. Accordingly, in the exercise of his discretion, he left 
  it open.</p>
<p>
  [34] Finally, I do not agree with the appellants' challenge to the bankruptcy 
  judge's description of the various collective agreements as "not terminated 
  but rather&#133;put into suspended animation".</p>
<p>
  [35] On January 10, 2003, the first day of the bankruptcy, it strikes me that 
  this description was entirely apt. On that date, it was simply too early to 
  attach formal, and final, legal labels to the relationship between the trustee 
  and the employees. Importantly, the bankruptcy judge explicitly recognized the 
  existence and importance of the collective agreements. Immediately after his 
  description of the collective agreements as contracts put into "suspended 
  animation", he effectively gave some advice to the trustee regarding the 
  importance of the employment relationship established by those agreements: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The trustee will also have to appreciate that if it does not accede to the union 
  demands for union dues, pension contributions and grievance-type procedures, 
  then conceivably after a period of time (which may vary in length) the personnel 
  which it has employed may become disenchanted with continuing at the various 
  locations and value may evaporate or start to do so unless "corrective" 
  or "ameliorating" measures are taken.</p>
<p>
  [36] For these reasons, I conclude that the bankruptcy judge did not err, in 
  the exercise of his discretion, by deciding that the appellants' cross-motion 
  seeking leave to make an application on the successor employer issue to the 
  OLRB was premature and, therefore, should be dismissed.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [37] I would dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at $20,000 inclusive of disbursements 
  and G.S.T.</p>

<p>
  "J. C. MacPherson J.A."<br>
  "I agree E. A. Cronk J.A."</p>

<p>
  BORINS J.A. (Dissenting): </p>
<p>
  [38] I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of my colleague, 
  MacPherson J.A. With respect, I am unable to agree with his conclusion that 
  this appeal should be dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [39] In my view, this appeal is about the exercise of judicial discretion in 
  the context of an application by two trade unions (the "appellants") 
  pursuant to s. 215 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 
  (the "BIA") for leave to bring an application before the Ontario Labour 
  Relations Board (the "OLRB") under s. 69(12) of the Labour Relations 
  Act, 1995, S.O. 1995, c.1, Sch. A (the "LRA") for a declaration that 
  Ernst &amp; Young, Inc. ("EYI"), the trustee in bankruptcy of The 
  Royal Crest Lifecare Group ("Royal Crest"), is a successor employer. 
  Thus, the issue in this appeal is whether there is any basis on which this court 
  can interfere with the discretion exercised by Farley J. in dismissing the appellants' 
  application under s. 215 of the BIA. For the reasons that follow, I have concluded 
  that the bankruptcy judge erred in the exercise of his discretion. </p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [40] At the outset, I find it helpful to repeat what I said about the standard 
  of appellate review of the exercise of judicial discretion in Wong v. Lee (2002), 
  58 O.R. (3d) 398 at 408-409: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The standard of appellate review of judicial discretion has been considered 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada in a number of cases. In Reza v. Canada, [1994] 
  2 S.C.R. 394 at pp. 404-05, 116 D.L.R. (4th) 61 at p. 68, the Supreme Court 
  held that: </p>
<p class="indent"> ...the test for appellate review of the exercise of judicial 
  discretion is whether the judge at first instance has given sufficient weight 
  to all relevant considerations: Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada 
  (Minister of Transport), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 76-77, per LaForest J. See 
  also Manitoba (Attorney General) v. Metropolitan Stores (MTS) Ltd., [1987] 1 
  S.C.R. 110, at pp. 154-55. </p>
<p class="indent">In Friends of Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport), 
  [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 76-77, LaForest J. stated that in Harelkin v. University 
  of Regina, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 561, 96 D.L.R. (3d) 14, the Supreme Court had essentially 
  adopted the following standard of review articulated by Viscount Simon L.C. 
  in Charles Osenton &amp; Co. v. Johnston, [1942] A.C. 130 at p. 138 (H.L.): 
</p>
<p class="indent">
  The law as to the reversal by a court of appeal of an order made by the judge 
  below in the exercise of his discretion is well-established, and any difficulty 
  that arises is due only to the application of well-settled principles in an 
  individual case. The appellate tribunal is not at liberty merely to substitute 
  its own exercise of discretion for the discretion already exercised by the judge. 
  In other words, appellate authorities ought not to reverse the order merely 
  because they would themselves have exercised the original discretion, had it 
  attached to them, in a different way. But if the appellate tribunal reaches 
  the clear conclusion that there has been a wrongful exercise of discretion in 
  that no weight, or no sufficient weight, has been given to relevant considerations 
  such as those urged before us by the appellant, then the reversal of the order 
  on appeal may be justified. </p>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  [41] It is also helpful to reproduce the legislation that is relevant to this 
  appeal. </p>
<p class="indent"> Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</p>
<p class="indent">s. 72(1) The provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to abrogate 
  or supersede the substantive provisions of any other law or statute relating 
  to property and civil rights that are not in conflict with this Act, and the 
  trustee is entitled to avail himself of all rights and remedies provided by 
  that law or statute as supplementary to and in addition to the rights and remedies 
  provided by this Act. </p>
<p class="indent">s. 215 Except by leave of the court, no action lies against 
  the Superintendent, an official receiver, an interim receiver or a trustee with 
  respect to any report made under, or any action taken pursuant to, this Act.</p>
<p class="indent">Labour Relations Act, 1995</p>
<p class="indent">s. 69(1) In this section,</p>
<p class="indent">"business" includes a part or parts thereof; ("enterprise")</p>
<p class="indent">"sells" includes leases, transfers and any other manner of disposition, 
  and "sold" and "sale" have corresponding meanings. ("vend", "vendu", "vente")</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where an employer who is bound by or is a party to a collective 
  agreement with a trade union or council of trade unions sells his, her or its 
  business, the person to whom the business has been sold is, until the Board 
  otherwise declares, bound by the collective agreement as if the person had been 
  a party thereto and, where an employer sells his, her or its business while 
  an application for certification or termination of bargaining rights to which 
  the employer is a party is before the Board, the person to whom the business

<p>
  [42] Although MacPherson J.A. has reviewed the facts which formed the basis 
  for both the appellants' s. 215 application and the trustee in bankruptcy's 
  application for declarations that it is not a successor employer under s. 69(12) 
  of the LRA and other labour and employment laws, his review does not make reference 
  to a number of facts that, in my view, are relevant to this appeal. Therefore, 
  I propose to outline these additional facts.</p>
<p>
  [43] When EYI was appointed as interim receiver of the estate of Royal Crest 
  on November 12, 2002, it immediately engaged the former Royal Crest employees 
  on a temporary basis under terms and conditions of employment similar but not 
  identical to those provided by the collective agreements. EYI was authorized 
  to do so by a term of the order that appointed it as interim receiver. Excluded 
  terms were access to a grievance procedure, full recognition of seniority, payment 
  of union dues and contributions to the company pension plan. The former Royal 
  Crest employees are members of the appellant unions which, prior to the bankruptcy, 
  had entered into collective agreements with the Royal Crest companies. At the 
  time of the interim receivership, there were, and remain, several outstanding 
  labour relations issues, such as: outstanding grievances involving employee 
  discipline; outstanding pay equity adjustments; the negotiation of a first time 
  collective agreement; and default in contributions to the pension plan. </p>
<p>
  [44] On November 13, 2002, EYI delivered a letter to each employee containing 
  an offer of employment and discussing, inter alia, the terms of employment. 
  In addition, the letter contained the following information: </p>
<p class="indent"> Our appointment as Interim-Receiver is on a temporary basis 
  and for the limited purpose of continuing the operation of the homes and protecting 
  the assets. It is our intent to stabilize the operations of the home by assuming 
  control of the homes and protecting the interests of the stakeholders, including 
  the residents whose health, safety and well being is of central concern. To 
  assist in achieving this objective, we have retained the services of Extendicare 
  (Canada) Inc. to manage and supervise the operations of the homes. </p>
<p class="indent">Pursuant to the terms of the Order, your employment by the Companies 
  has been terminated. We would like to engage your services on a temporary basis 
  to assist with the continued operation of the homes, which will assist the Interim-Receiver 
  in fulfilling its mandate to determine the best way to ensure the future of 
  the homes as going concerns. The purpose of this letter is to set out the terms 
  under which we are prepared to do so. </p>
<p class="center">. . .</p>
<p class="indent">In making this offer, the Interim-Receiver is acting solely 
  in its capacity as Interim-Receiver and without personal or corporate liability. 
  By accepting this offer you acknowledge that the Interim-Receiver is not a successor 
  employer within the meaning or contemplation of the Ontario Employment Standards 
  Act, 2000, the Ontario Labour Relations Act or other similar federal or provincial 
  legislation. </p>
<p>
  [45] On January 10, 2003, EYI was appointed as trustee in bankruptcy of the 
  estate of Royal Crest under the BIA. On January 17, 2003, pursuant to s. 101 
  of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 (the "CJA"), EYI 
  was appointed as receiver over the assets, property and undertaking of Royal 
  Crest for the purpose of realizing thereon. Although clause 11 of this order 
  expressly precluded the engagement of any or all of Royal Crest's former employees, 
  on January 17, 2003, the trustee delivered a letter to the former employees 
  that contained an offer of employment. </p>
<p>
  [46] The relevant portions of this letter read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> As noted previously, the Interim Receiver was appointed on 
  a temporary basis until the appointment of the Trustee, and therefore the role 
  of the Interim Receiver has come to an end effective January 17, 2003. The Trustee 
  will continue to operate the homes in the same manner as the Interim Receiver, 
  and the Trustee has retained the services of Extendicare (Canada) Inc. to manage 
  and supervise the operations of the homes. </p>
<p class="indent">Your employment with the Interim Receiver has ceased effective 
  January 17, 2003 and the Trustee will immediately re-engage your services on 
  a temporary basis to assist with the continued operation of the homes, on the 
  same terms and conditions as outlined in the Offer of Employment. Your services 
  are required to assist the Trustee in fulfilling its mandate to determine the 
  best way to ensure the future of the homes as going concerns. The purpose of 
  this letter is to set out the terms under which we are prepared to do so. </p>
<p class="indent">You will be paid the same regular wages or salary that you have 
  been receiving from the Interim Receiver. The Trustee will continue to provide 
  all benefits provided by the Interim Receiver to you. The Trustee, in the same 
  manner as the Interim Receiver, is unable to continue to provide benefits provided 
  by the Companies to you prior to the appointment of the Interim Receiver (including, 
  but not limited to, life insurance, disability or pension benefits or RRSP contributions). 
  The Trustee will be making the usual payroll deductions to the appropriate government 
  authority on your behalf. </p>
<p class="indent">In making this offer, the Trustee is acting solely in its capacity 
  as Trustee and without personal or corporate liability. By continuing to work 
  in the homes after January 17, 2003 you will be deemed to have accepted this 
  offer, have read and understand fully the terms of this letter and agreed to 
  be bound by its terms. You have also acknowledged that the Trustee is not a 
  successor employer within the meaning or contemplation of the Ontario ESA, the 
  Ontario Labour Relations Act or similar federal or provincial legislation. </p>
<p>
  [47] From the foregoing, it is clear that from the outset EYI, in its various 
  capacities, recognized that it was prudent to operate the nursing homes as a 
  going concern for two related reasons: (1) to accommodate the 2300 patients 
  and residents of the homes; and (2) to maximize the potential dividend to be 
  paid to Royal Crest's creditors by selling the nursing homes as a going concern. 
  Moreover, it recognized that the most efficient way to continue to operate the 
  homes was to engage the former employees of Royal Crest. Indeed, this appeared 
  to be of such importance to EYI that in its second letter to the employees it 
  wrote: "Your services are required to assist the Trustee in fulfilling 
  its mandate to determine the best way to ensure the future of the homes as going 
  concerns". </p>
<p>
  [48] When the appellants' motion was before the court, it was clear that the 
  operation of the homes was continuing in the same manner as it had before Royal 
  Crest was granted protection under the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act, 
  R.S.C. 1985, c. C.36 (the "CCAA") on October 21, 2002, and throughout 
  the two month period of the interim receivership. It appeared that this operation 
  would continue in the same manner until the trustee in bankruptcy was able to 
  sell the nursing home business as a going concern. Thus, when the appellants' 
  s. 215 motion was before the court, approximately 2200 employees were continuing 
  the operation of the nursing homes for approximately 2300 patients and residents, 
  and would continue to do so subsequent to EYI's appointment as trustee in bankruptcy 
  and receiver until EYI was able to obtain a purchaser willing to acquire the 
  nursing homes as a going concern. </p>
<p>
  [49] From the letters it wrote to the former employees of Royal Crest, it is 
  clear that EYI did not wish to be declared a successor employer under s. 69(12) 
  pf the LRA. It is evident from EYI's application for an order declaring that 
  the trustee in bankruptcy is not a successor employer under the LRA, the Occupational 
  Health and Safety Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1, the Employment Standards Act, 2000, 
  S.O. 2000, c. 41, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, S.O. 1997, c. 16, 
  Sch. A, the Pay Equity Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.7, the Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. H.19, the Pension Benefits Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.8 and the Pension 
  Benefits Standards Act, 1985, R.S.C. 1985, c. 32 (2nd Supp.) or any other legislation 
  or common law governing labour relations, that EYI recognized that in the administration 
  of an estate under the BIA, a trustee in bankruptcy is required to do so in 
  conformity with provincial legislation governing employees and employee rights. 
  </p>
<p>
  IV</p>
<p>
  [50] The test that applies in considering an application under s. 215 of the 
  BIA for leave to bring proceedings against a trustee has received considerable 
  judicial attention. As MacPherson J.A. points out, the case law establishes 
  that the threshold for granting leave is a low one. However, in applying the 
  test it is necessary to consider that s. 215 is part of the machinery of the 
  BIA which is designed to ensure that the purposes of the Act can be carried 
  out properly without the undue intervention of other proceedings. As such, the 
  purpose of s. 215 is to protect the trustee against frivolous and vexatious 
  proceedings, or proceedings that have no factual basis. </p>
<p>
  [51] This court considered s. 186 of the former Bankruptcy Act, the predecessor 
  of s. 215, in Mancini (Bankrupt) et al. v. Falconi et al. (1993), 61 O.A.C. 
  332. After reviewing a number of authorities, in para. 7 Osborne J.A. set out 
  the factors to be considered on a s. 215 application: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The following principles can be taken from the decided cases: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Leave to sue a trustee should not be granted if the action 
  is frivolous or vexatious. Manifestly unmeritorious claims should not be permitted 
  to proceed. </p>
<p class="indent">2. An action should not be allowed to proceed if the evidence 
  filed in support of the motion, including the intended action as pleaded in 
  draft form, does not disclose a cause of action against the trustee. The evidence 
  typically will be presented by way of affidavit and must supply facts to support 
  the claim sought to be asserted: see Peat Marwick Ltd. v. Thorne Riddell, supra.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The court is not required to make a final assessment of the 
  merits of the claim before granting leave: see Re Lufro Lt&eacute;e; Leblond 
  v. Tremblay (1985), 54 C.B.R. (N.S.) 199 (Que. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [52] In para. 12 Osborne J.A. stated that the court is required to consider 
  the evidence filed in support of the application in the context of the proposed 
  proceeding when adjudicating a s. 215 leave application. He continued: "The 
  issue is not whether the evidence on the [s. 215] motion discloses the existence 
  of a cause of action against the trustee, but rather whether the evidence provides 
  the required support for the cause of action sought to be asserted [against 
  the trustee]" [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [53] Osborne J.A. commented further on what factors the evidence must establish 
  and the sufficiency of the evidence in paras. 16 - 17: </p>
<p class="indent"> In my opinion, the motions court judge was correct in reaching 
  the conclusion he did on this issue. On a continuum of evidence ranging from 
  no evidence to evidence which is conclusive, the evidence required to support 
  an order under s. 186 must be sufficient to establish that there is a factual 
  basis for the proposed claim and that the proposed claim discloses a cause of 
  action. </p>
<p class="indent">The sufficiency of the evidence must be measured in the context 
  of the purpose of s. 186 which, as stated earlier, is to prevent the trustee 
  from having to respond to actions which are frivolous or vexatious or from claims 
  which do not disclose a cause of action. As I have previously noted, the evidence 
  on a motion under s. 186 does not have to be sufficient to enable the motions 
  court judge to make a final assessment of the merits of the claim sought to 
  be made, but it must be sufficient to address the issues that I have identified, 
  having in mind the objectives of s. 186 [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  V</p>
<p>
  [54] The bankruptcy judge's reasons for rejecting the appellants' s. 215 application 
  are reported as Royal Crest Lifecare Group Inc. (Re), [2003] O.J. No. 756. Early 
  in his reasons, in para. 6, the bankruptcy judge identified "the contentious 
  issue or battlefield [to be] whether the trustee in bankruptcy can become a 
  successor employer [pursuant to s. 69 of the LRA] if the trustee hires employees 
  to do the work previously engaged in by employees pre-bankruptcy". After 
  reviewing the positions of the parties, the bankruptcy judge considered the 
  trustee's submission that collective agreements terminate upon an employer's 
  bankruptcy. He appears to have accepted the reasoning of the Nova Scotia Court 
  of Appeal in Saan Stores Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Labour Relations Board) (1999), 
  172 D.L.R. (4th) 134 that although bankruptcy terminates the employment relationship 
  between a bankrupt employer and its employees, a collective agreement is "not 
  rendered inoperative" by reason of an employer's bankruptcy.</p>
<p>
  [55] In paras. 24 - 26 the bankruptcy judge discussed the statutory mandate 
  of a trustee in bankruptcy. In my opinion, as this discussion is relevant to 
  his ultimate decision to dismiss the appellants' application, it is helpful 
  to reproduce it in its entirety: </p>
<p class="indent"> It seems to me that when one appreciates that the mandate of 
  a trustee in bankruptcy is to maximize value of the assets vested in the trustee 
  on a bankruptcy for the purpose of providing a dividend to the creditors to 
  partially satisfy their claims, the circumstance of operating the business (if 
  the assets are the business and undertaking) is merely ancillary and incidental 
  to that function of realizing upon the assets. Coupled with the rather "new-found" 
  objective and thrust of the BIA since the 1992 amendments with the significant 
  social and economic policy with particular positive impact for employees and 
  the communities in which these employees live to have businesses, if possible 
  and practicable, sold as a going concern (such being the usual way in which 
  to maximize value as well), it would be undesirable to saddle the Trustee with 
  (heavy) personal liabilities which may arise either from a finding of "successor 
  employer" against the trustee or a conclusion that a trustee who hires personnel 
  "inherits" an operative collective agreement. Simply put, what role is the trustee 
  truly playing - is it acting qua realizor of the assets or is it acting qua 
  employer in essence. Where the business cannot be conveniently mothballed (e.g. 
  a steel mill where the blast furnaces must be kept active or otherwise the furnaces 
  would "solidify" or, as here, where the residents cannot be easily transferred 
  both physically and as well with concern for their emotional disruption), it 
  seems that the trustee may be "forced" to operate the business during the period 
  of marketing through sale. The maintenance of going concern goodwill will also 
  be an important factor in determining whether it is reasonable to continue some 
  or all of the operations, even if it were not a physical problem to shut down 
  operations. If the trustee did not operate the business where that was physically 
  necessary or to maximize value of realization, then the trustee would be acting 
  contrary to the principles of the BIA and in so acting would be derelict in 
  its duties and obligations under that federal insolvency statute. </p>
<p class="indent">It seems to me that where a trustee is operating the business 
  as incidental to the trustee disposing of it and realizing on the assets and 
  there is no question or issue raised that it is pursuing a marketing and ultimately 
  sale/disposition program in a reasonable and bona fide way with due dispatch, 
  then the question of employment of personnel is only incidental to its function 
  of realizing on the assets (and protecting stakeholder interests in going concern 
  preservation).</p>
<p class="indent">I certainly agree with the observations of Spence J. in 588871 
  at p. 33: </p>
<p class="indent"> PMTI also contended that this motion involves an important 
  policy question. If, in circumstances such as those in the present case, a trustee 
  in bankruptcy who is given authority to carry on the business is to be exposed 
  to the risk of being considered a successor employer and the attendant liabilities 
  of the status, no trustee would ever undertake to carry on that business and 
  that could thwart the proper operation of the BIA. I think this concern may 
  properly be taken into account. </p>
<p class="indent">I do not regard this as an "in terrorem" argument as so characterized 
  by CUPE's counsel. Spence J. went on to state at p. 33: </p>
<p class="indent">
  With respect to the request for leave, I think a delicate balancing of the relevant 
  considerations is required. The [OLRB] clearly has jurisdiction under the OLRA 
  to make a determination that there has been a sale of a business and that PMTI 
  is a successor employer. The considerations which have been raised here concerning 
  the apparent inconsistencies between a positive determination to that effect 
  and bankruptcy principles and the order of December 14, 1994 could presumably 
  be considered in those proceedings to the extent germane and in any other proceedings 
  that may be taken in this matter. The courts should ordinarily defer to the 
  [OLRB] on a matter clearly within its statutory jurisdiction. On the other hand, 
  if a decision were taken by the [OLRB] against the trustee, it would involve 
  the inconsistencies mentioned above. It would be incompatible with the termination 
  of the collective agreement as a result of the bankruptcy and the limited role 
  of a trustee in bankruptcy in carrying on a business. It seems to me that such 
  matters are properly to be addressed by this court on this application for leave 
  under the BIA and not to be deferred for decision to a tribunal which is not 
  charged with responsibility in respect of the bankruptcy law. The stay of proceedings 
  imposed by s. 215 of the BIA is one part of the machinery of the Act which functions 
  to ensure that the purposes of the Act can be carried out properly without the 
  undue intervention of other proceedings. The stay imposed under s. 215 has a 
  proper effect in this case, for the reasons mentioned above. Accordingly, the 
  request for leave nunc pro tunc should not be granted [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [56] In paras. 29 - 30, the bankruptcy judge then gave what I understand to 
  be his reasons for dismissing the appellants' application: </p>
<p class="indent"> There has been no allegation, let alone evidence, that the 
  Trustee here (even if one were to consider E&amp;Y Inc. in its capacity as IR) 
  has been dragging its feet or will do so. The CUPE cross-motion for leave is 
  dismissed without prejudice to such a motion being brought back on again with 
  appropriate factual underpinning which I would be of the view ought to demonstrate 
  that the Trustee has slipped over from functioning qua realizor of assets in 
  a diligent fashion to the role of being predominantly an employer in its activities. 
</p>
<p class="indent">In the meantime it appears to me that the collective agreement 
  is not terminated but rather is put into suspended animation, to be revived 
  if, as, and when a purchaser with a personal economic interest in the operation 
  of the business acquires the business [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  [57] Read as a whole, as I read his reasons, the bankruptcy judge dismissed 
  the appellants' application for leave to commence proceedings before the OLRB 
  for a declaration that EYI is a successor employer under s. 69(12) of the LRA 
  because he was of the view that if the application before the Board were to 
  succeed, a declaration that the trustee in bankruptcy is a successor employer 
  would interfere with the mandate of a trustee, saddle the trustee "with 
  (heavy) personal liabilities", would discourage trustees from carrying 
  on a business as a going concern and would be incompatible with the termination 
  of a collective agreement consequent to the bankruptcy of an employer. As a 
  result, the bankruptcy judge agreed with the opinion of Spence J. in Re 588871 
  Ontario Ltd. (1995), 33 C.B.R. (3d) 28 (Ont. Gen. Div.), that although the OLRB 
  has exclusive jurisdiction over the determination of "whether a business 
  has been sold by one employer to another", the court should not defer to 
  the jurisdiction of the Board where a successor employer application is made 
  in the context of a bankruptcy; instead, this determination should be made by 
  a court "charged" with responsibilities in respect to bankruptcy law.</p>
<p>
  [58] As his ultimate reason for dismissing the application for leave, the bankruptcy 
  judge stated that the trustee in bankruptcy had not "been dragging its 
  feet" and there was no suggestion that it would do so. However, the dismissal 
  of the application was without prejudice to it being reinstated "with appropriate 
  factual underpinning... to demonstrate that the trustee has slipped over from 
  functioning qua realizor of assets in a diligent fashion to the role of being 
  predominantly an employer in its activities".</p>
<p>
  VI</p>
<p>
  [59] In analyzing the bankruptcy judge's reasons for dismissing the appellants' 
  application under s. 215 of the BIA it is helpful to recall that the authorities 
  are uniform that the test to be applied by the court sets a low threshold.</p>
<p>
  [60] With respect to the first element of the test established in Mancini, in 
  my view, there can be no question that the proposed application to the OLRB 
  is neither frivolous nor vexatious. At the time of the application, EYI was 
  operating the same business that was operated by Royal Crest and had hired the 
  same employees that had been employed by Royal Crest to perform the same function 
  that they had performed previously. EYI had done so as interim receiver for 
  two months prior to its appointment as trustee in bankruptcy and receiver. Moreover, 
  neither EYI nor the bankruptcy judge suggested that the proposed application 
  to the OLRB was frivolous or vexatious. </p>
<p>
  [61] Under the second element of the test, the proposed application to the OLRB 
  must disclose "a cause of action" against the trustee in bankruptcy. 
  This is to be decided on the basis of evidence that is sufficient to establish 
  a factual basis for the proposed OLRB application. In the context of these proceedings, 
  the "cause of action" against the trustee consists of the assertion 
  that in the operation of the Royal Crest's business as a going concern, the 
  trustee had become a successor employer within the meaning of s. 69(12) of the 
  LRA. It would appear that the trustee's operation of Royal Crest's business 
  as a going concern for the benefit of its creditors and the patients and residents 
  mitigates in favour of a finding by the OLRB that the trustee is a successor 
  employer. There is little doubt that the evidence of the history of EYI's operation 
  of the business since its appointment as interim receiver on November 12, 2002, 
  provided a factual basis for the appellants' application as contemplated by 
  the second element of the Mancini test.</p>
<p>
  [62] In considering whether the proposed application to the OLRB discloses a 
  cause of action against the trustee in bankruptcy it is important to recognize 
  that s. 69(2) of the LRA provides that a union continues to be the bargaining 
  agent for the employees of the person, or entity, to whom a business is sold 
  until the OLRB otherwise declares. As pointed out by George W. Adams in his 
  text, Canadian Labour Law, 2nd ed. looseleaf (Aurora:Canada Law Book Inc., 2003) 
  at 8.10: </p>
<p class="indent">
  ...collective bargaining rights flow through changes in ownership so long as 
  there is a continuation of the same business. It is the business - and not the 
  employer - to which collective bargaining rights have become attached...The 
  successor provisions [of the LRA] have a two-fold purpose: to protect the trade 
  union's right to bargain and to protect any subsisting collective agreement 
  from termination upon sale.</p>
<p>
  [63] Moreover, as Mr. Adams points out at 8.190, labour boards have adopted 
  a broad and liberal interpretation of successorship provisions, including what 
  constitutes the sale of a business under s. 69(1) of the LRA, in accordance 
  with the remedial nature of the legislation. After reviewing the case law, Mr. 
  Adams concludes: </p>
<p class="indent">
  For the most part, the Ontario and British Columbia courts accept and recognize 
  that the substantial similarity of work performed subsequent to a transaction 
  to that performed prior to a transaction normally creates a strong inference 
  there has been a transfer of a business. The criteria relevant to such an interpretation 
  are: (a) substantially the same jobs being performed at the same time and places; 
  (b) in respect of substantially the same goods and services; and (c) for substantially 
  the same customers or patrons. </p>
<p>
  [64] In determining whether the appellants' proposed application to the OLRB 
  disclosed a "cause of action" against the trustee in bankruptcy, it 
  was necessary that the bankruptcy judge consider not only the purpose of the 
  successorship provision in s. 69 of the LRA, but the criteria relevant to the 
  determination of whether the trustee could be found by the OLRB to be a successor 
  employer. The bankruptcy judge failed to do so. Based on the above criteria, 
  there is an abundance of evidence in the record to establish a factual basis 
  for the proposed successorship application to the OLRB. </p>
<p>
  [65] As for the third element of the Mancini test, the bankruptcy judge must 
  not make a final assessment of the proposed claim or application. Although the 
  bankruptcy judge did not in fact do so in this case, in my view he came perilously 
  close to doing so. He followed the decision of Spence J. in Re 588871 Ontario 
  Ltd. that the question of successorship should be effectively decided on a motion 
  to the bankruptcy court under s. 215 of the BIA, contrary to s. 114(1) of the 
  LRA that provides that the OLRB has exclusive jurisdiction to exercise the powers 
  conferred upon it by the LRA. </p>
<p>
  [66] In addition, I have difficulty in understanding what the bankruptcy judge 
  meant in para. 24 by his characterization of the trustee's role as "acting 
  qua realizor of the assets or qua employer in essence". In my view, if 
  it is the opinion of the trustee in bankruptcy that the maximum dividend for 
  creditors can be achieved by selling the bankrupt's business as a going concern 
  it stands to reason that the trustee can do so only if it has the necessary 
  employees to operate the business. The bankruptcy judge reasoned that the trustee's 
  employment of personnel was "only incidental" to its function of realizing 
  on the assets and "protecting stakeholder interests in going concern preservation". 
  With respect, I do not agree with this reasoning. The operation of the business 
  as a going concern and the re-hiring of Royal Crest's employees to accomplish 
  this are neither incidental nor ancillary to the trustee's role to maximize 
  and maintain the value of the assets for the benefit of the creditors. In my 
  view, they are central to that role. Without the former Royal Crest employees, 
  the trustee could not operate the nursing home business as a going concern. 
  The employees have statutory rights which an employer must respect. The unions 
  were attempting to protect and enforce their members' rights in seeking leave 
  to apply to the OLRB to obtain a successorship ruling.</p>
<p>
  [67] The bankruptcy judge returned to this theme in para. 29, where he gave 
  his ultimate reason for dismissing the appellants' s. 215 application. He was 
  of the view that the length of time during which the trustee in bankruptcy had 
  operated the business was pertinent to whether or not the trustee might be declared 
  a successor employer under s. 69 of the OLRA. Thus, he permitted the appellants 
  to make a further application should the trustee "[slip] over from functioning 
  qua realizor of assets in a diligent fashion to the role of being predominantly 
  an employer in its activities".</p>
<p>
  [68] Moreover, in my view the bankruptcy judge minimized the fact that this 
  case involves the rights of employees and workers and that under the legislative 
  scheme of the LRA the only recourse available to the unions in protecting the 
  rights of their members was to bring the appropriate proceeding before the OLRB. 
  In addition, the bankruptcy judge appears to have placed the trustee's role 
  under the BIA ahead of the employees' statutory rights conferred by the statutes 
  that I have listed in para. 12. In doing so, it seems that he overlooked the 
  proposition that except in the case of "operational conflict", valid 
  provincial law of general application continues to apply in a bankruptcy context: 
  Husky Oil Operations Ltd. v. M.N.R., [1995] 3 S.C.R. 453. This is also recognized 
  in s. 72(1) of the BIA where Parliament has explicitly called for the application 
  of provincial law in administering a bankrupt estate, except to the extent that 
  it is inconsistent with the terms of the BIA. </p>
<p>
  [69] In making these observations I am mindful that the court did not require 
  submissions from the parties on the constitutional issue raised by the respondent 
  trustee and I do not intend, by my observations, to be taken as determining 
  that issue. The purpose of my observations is to indicate that as the rights 
  of employees and workers are central to the unions' s. 215 application, it is 
  my view that early recourse to the OLRB was an appropriate factor for the bankruptcy 
  judge to take into account in applying the Mancini test.</p>
<p>
  [70] In summary, the bankruptcy judge placed too much emphasis on the bankruptcy 
  environment and gave insufficient weight to the essential character of the issues 
  that the unions sought to advance before the OLRB on behalf of their members. 
  While the important role performed by bankruptcy trustees is deserving of protection, 
  the rights of labour unions to pursue legitimate issues on behalf of their members 
  must also be respected. As, in my view, the bankruptcy judge did not give sufficient 
  weight to these considerations and to the test to be applied on an application 
  under s. 215 of the BIA as explained in Mancini, he erred in the exercise of 
  his discretion. </p>
<p>
  [71] In my opinion, the unions' s. 215 application was timely and prudent. Nothing 
  about the application was premature. The unions should not be faulted for bringing 
  it on the day that the court appointed EYI as trustee in bankruptcy. It was 
  brought in response to EYI's application for a declaration that it be deemed 
  not to be a successor employer. EYI was no stranger to the business operation 
  of Royal Crest. For two months prior to its appointment as trustee, as interim 
  receiver it had operated the nursing home business with Royal Crest's former 
  employees. As trustee, it was intending to operate the business with the same 
  employees. The employees had statutory rights which the unions believed required 
  recourse to the OLRB for their protection. Had the bankruptcy judge granted 
  the unions' application for leave to apply to the OLRB, or, indeed, should this 
  court do so, the work of the trustee in administering the estate would not have 
  been delayed or frustrated as it would have continued its operation of the nursing 
  homes, thereby benefiting both the creditors and the residents, while it continued 
  its search for a purchaser of the business as a going concern. At the same time, 
  the unions would have been able to prepare their application to the OLRB.</p>
<p>
  [72] Indeed, nothing changed in the operation of the business on January 10, 
  2003 other than the status of EYI, which continued that operation as trustee 
  in bankruptcy rather than as interim receiver. The trustee was of the opinion 
  that the record supported its application, which acknowledged the existence 
  of the collective agreements, for a declaration that it was not a successor 
  employer. The unions relied on the same record. Moreover, had the bankruptcy 
  judge granted the unions' application for leave to bring a s. 69(12) application 
  before the OLRB, the record could only have improved in the time that it would 
  have taken for the application to be heard by the OLRB.</p>
<p>
  VII</p>
<p>
  [73] For all of the foregoing reasons, it is my view that there was a wrongful 
  exercise of discretion by the bankruptcy judge as a result of his failure to 
  apply the test in Mancini and to give sufficient weight to the relevant considerations 
  as argued before us by the appellants. Therefore, this is a proper case for 
  this court to interfere with the bankruptcy judge's exercise of discretion. 
  </p>
<p>
  [74] In the result, I would allow the appeal with costs, set aside the order 
  of the bankruptcy judge and substitute an order granting leave to the appellants 
  pursuant to s. 215 of the BIA to bring an application to the OLRB under s. 69(12) 
  of the LRA.</p>
