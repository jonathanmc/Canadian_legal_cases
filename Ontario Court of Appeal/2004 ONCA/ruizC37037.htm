<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant's principal submission is that the trial judge misdirected 
  himself with respect to defence of accident and, in effect, rejected that defence 
  on the basis that on the appellant's own evidence he was at least guilty of 
  criminal negligence. The appellant also submits that the trial judge did not 
  adequately deal with the expert evidence and did not provide reasons for rejecting 
  the appellant's evidence. </p>
<p>[2] We would not give effect to these submissions. Irrespective of the trial 
  judge's treatment of the accident defence, he made clear findings that this 
  was an intentional assault. The trial judge also described how the blows were 
  inflicted. It is implicit in those findings that he rejected the appellant's 
  evidence, which was inconsistent with the expert evidence, which he did accept. 
</p>
<p>[3] The trial judge's treatment of the conflict in the expert evidence was 
  proper and is consistent with this court's decisions in R. v. Molnar (1990), 
  55 C.C.C. (3d) 446 and R. v. Smith (2001), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 1. In particular, 
  the trial judge's careful analysis of Dr. Shouldice's evidence shows that he 
  rejected the basis for the opinion of the defence expert. </p>
<p>[4] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed and the appeal from 
  sentence is dismissed as abandoned.</p>
