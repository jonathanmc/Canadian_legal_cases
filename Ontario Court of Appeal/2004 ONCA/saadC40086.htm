<p>On appeal from committal by Justice Sandra Chapnik of the Superior Court of 
  Justice on May 1, 2003, reasons reported at [2003] O.J. No. 1654 and [2003] 
  O.J. No. 1655.</p>
<p>ROSENBERG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Najeeb Majed Saad appeals from the order of Chapnik J. committing him for 
  extradition on certain drug offences and a sexual offence. He also applies for 
  judicial review of the order of the Minister of Justice that he be surrendered 
  to the United States of America. For convenience, I will refer to Mr. Saad as 
  the appellant. The appellant's principal grounds of appeal from committal and 
  for seeking judicial review concern the sufficiency of the Authority to Proceed. 
  While I would not give effect to those submissions, I would allow the appeal 
  in part and quash that part of the committal order relating to one of the drug 
  charges. Accordingly, I would remit the matter to the Minister to give further 
  consideration to whether to order the appellant's surrender.</p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [2] On March 26, 2003, the Minister of Justice, pursuant to s. 15 of the Extradition 
  Act, S.C. 1999, c. 18, issued an Authority to Proceed to the Attorney General 
  of Canada to proceed before the Superior Court of Justice to seek an order for 
  the committal of the appellant. The Authority to Proceed lists six Canadian 
  offences that correspond to the alleged conduct for which the United States 
  seeks the appellant's extradition. As the appellant was discharged on three 
  of the offences, I need only refer to the following three offences: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Trafficking in N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine), 
  a substance represented or held out to be ecstasy (between February 1, 2002 
  and April 15, 2002), contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances 
  Act;</p>
<p class="indent">2. Trafficking in cocaine, a substance represented to be or 
  held out to be cocaine (between February 1, 2002 and April 15, 2002), contrary 
  to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; and</p>
<p class="indent">3. Sexual Assault ([J.R.]) contrary to section 271 of the Criminal 
  Code.</p>
<p>
  [3] The evidence in support of the application for extradition is contained 
  in the Second Amended Record of the Case for Prosecution (the Record of the 
  Case). It summarizes the testimony that is available for trial and would be 
  sufficient under the law of the State of Florida to justify prosecution. That 
  testimony can be briefly summarized as follows. </p>
<p>
  [4] On Friday February 8, 2002, the appellant met with two juveniles, E.S. and 
  J.G., in Brevard County, Florida. On this occasion, the appellant gave the juveniles 
  "ecstasy" and drove the juveniles to a wooded area where they engaged 
  in various sexual acts. These juveniles were 15 years of age. The appellant 
  was 27 years of age at the time. The following day the appellant, E.S. and J.G. 
  drove to the Merritt Island area where the appellant supplied the juveniles 
  with cocaine and "energy pills". This conduct continued over the next 
  two months and involved a number of juveniles in addition to E.S. and J.G. In 
  particular, at some time between February 16th and March 2nd, the appellant 
  supplied J.R., another juvenile, with ecstasy. J.R. passed out and when he regained 
  consciousness he found the appellant having anal intercourse with him.</p>
<p>
  [5] The drugs supplied by the appellant to the juveniles on the various occasions 
  were no longer available for analysis. Accordingly, the Authority to Proceed 
  alleges trafficking on the basis of "holding out". The evidence as 
  to what was held out as "ecstasy" is in the expected testimony of 
  Deputy J.C. Harrison that he was told that the appellant supplied the juveniles 
  with "methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine, otherwise known as ecstasy".</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  Appeal from committal</p>
<p>
  Sufficiency of the Authority to Proceed</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant submits that the Authority to Proceed is inadequate as it 
  did not particularize the transactions that were the subject matter of the extradition 
  request. He submits that the materials produced by the extradition partner did 
  not include the Florida charging documents or the relevant American legislation. 
  He submits that the Authority to Proceed when read on its own, or even when 
  read with the record of the case, did not define the factual transactions that 
  were the subject of the extradition request.</p>
<p>
  [7] A preliminary issue with respect to this ground of appeal is whether the 
  extradition judge had jurisdiction to quash the Authority to Proceed or discharge 
  the appellant because of the alleged inadequacy of the Authority to Proceed. 
  The extradition judge's jurisdiction is statutory and there is no provision 
  in the Extradition Act that expressly gives the judge the power to quash a deficient 
  Authority to Proceed. Thus, s. 23 of the Act provides that the Minister may 
  substitute another Authority to Proceed at any time before the extradition hearing 
  begins, that the judge may "on application of the Attorney General" 
  amend the Authority to Proceed after the hearing is begun, and that the Minister 
  may at any time withdraw the Authority to Proceed, in which case, the court 
  shall discharge the person. However, neither s. 23 nor any other provision of 
  the Act appears to contemplate that the extradition judge can review the sufficiency 
  of the Authority to Proceed. </p>
<p>
  [8] Finally, s. 24(2) of the Act provides that Part XVIII of the Criminal Code 
  applies, "with any modifications that the circumstances require" at 
  the extradition hearing. Part XVIII deals with the procedure at preliminary 
  inquiries. However, the provision of the Criminal Code that deals with the sufficiency 
  of indictments and informations, and gives a judge the power to quash an insufficient 
  indictment or information, is set out in s. 601 of the Code, which is in Part 
  XX of the Code, and would therefore not seem to apply to extradition hearings. 
  See Froom v. Canada (Minister of Justice), [2003] F.C.J. No. 1655 (T.D.) at 
  para. 97.</p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant submits that the extradition judge had the power to quash 
  an insufficient Authority to Proceed under s. 25 of the Act, which provides 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  For the purposes of the Constitution Act, 1982, a judge has, with respect to 
  the functions that the judge is required to perform in applying this Act, the 
  same competence that that judge possesses by virtue of being a superior court 
  judge.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant submits that if the Authority to Proceed is insufficient 
  to provide adequate notice of the case he faces, this would violate the principles 
  of fundamental justice, and the extradition judge could quash the information 
  as a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I am prepared 
  to assume that the extradition judge would have such a power. I note, however, 
  that it may well be that a person who believes that the Authority to Proceed 
  is insufficient may be able to apply to the Federal Court to review the sufficiency 
  of the Authority to Proceed. See Froom v. Canada (Minister of Justice), at para. 
  54.</p>
<p>
  [11] Section 15(3) of the Extradition Act sets out the contents of the Authority 
  to Proceed in these terms: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Authority to Proceed must contain</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the name or description of the person whose extradition 
  is sought; </p>
<p class="indent">(b) the name of the extradition partner; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the name of the offence or offences under Canadian law that 
  correspond to the alleged conduct of the person or the conduct in respect of 
  which the person was convicted, as long as one of the offences would be punishable 
  in accordance with paragraph 3(1)(b).</p>
<p>
  [12] The Authority to Proceed in this case complies with these mandatory requirements. 
  In addition, it sets out the dates of the alleged drug-related offences and, 
  in the case of the sexual offence, the name of the victim. The appellant submits, 
  however, that the Authority to Proceed should set out particulars of the transactions 
  so that he has notice of the case he must meet, and so as to ensure compliance 
  with the rule of specialty. The latter rule prohibits the extradition partner 
  from prosecuting for crimes other than those for which extradition was ordered. 
  See U.S.A. v. Manno (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 544 (Que. C.A.) at p. 552.</p>
<p>
  [13] I will begin with a consideration of the rule of specialty. An analysis 
  of this claim requires reference to other parts of the Act. I start with s. 
  29, which sets out the extradition judge's function upon committal: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) A judge shall order the committal of the person into custody 
  to await surrender if</p>
<p class="indent">(a) in the case of a person sought for prosecution, there is 
  evidence admissible under this Act of conduct that, had it occurred in Canada, 
  would justify committal for trial in Canada on the offence set out in the Authority 
  to Proceed and the judge is satisfied that the person is the person sought by 
  the extradition partner; </p>
<p class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> (2) The order of committal must contain</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the name of the person; </p>
<p class="indent">(b) the offence set out in the Authority to Proceed for which 
  the committal is ordered; </p>
<p class="indent">(c) the place at which the person is to be held in custody; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">(d) the name of the extradition partner.</p>
<p>
  [14] Thus, there is nothing in s. 29 of the Act that requires the extradition 
  judge to specify the particulars of the transaction. In this sense, s. 29 tracks 
  s. 15(3), which sets out the mandatory requirements for the Authority to Proceed. 
  The appellant submits that unless the Authority to Proceed contains particulars 
  of the transaction, there is a risk that the person may be returned to the extradition 
  partner on a vague charge and will therefore lose the benefit of the rule of 
  specialty. </p>
<p>
  [15] In my view, this argument requires consideration of the provisions of the 
  Act relating to the surrender order by the Minister and in particular s. 58, 
  which sets out the requirements for the order of surrender. Section 58 provides, 
  in part, as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> An order of surrender must</p>
<p class="indent">(a) contain the name of the person who is to be surrendered; 
</p>
<p class="indent">(b) describe the offence in respect of which the extradition 
  is requested, the offence for which the committal was ordered or the conduct 
  for which the person is to be surrendered; </p>
<p class="indent">(c) state the extradition partner to which the person is to 
  be conveyed; </p>
<p class="center">
  …</p>
<p> [16] Thus, s. 58(b) provides three different ways in which the order of surrender 
  may be made. The first option is for the order of surrender to be based on the 
  offence in respect of which the extradition is requested, which I take to mean 
  that the Minister would make the order in terms of the foreign charging document. 
  That is what was done in this case: the Minister's order of surrender describes 
  the offences by reference to the specific charges in the Florida charging documents. 
  Alternatively, the Minister may make the order by reference to the offence for 
  which the committal was ordered, which I take to mean in the terms of the Authority 
  to Proceed in accordance with s. 29(2)(b).<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> 
  Finally, the Minister may make the order by reference to the conduct for which 
  the person is to be surrendered, which I assume would require reference to the 
  Record of the Case.</p>
<p>
  [17] As I have said, in this case the Minister made the surrender order by reference 
  to the specific charges in the charging document from Florida. The order of 
  surrender provides in part that the Minister orders the surrender of the appellant 
  "for the offences of </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  1) Six counts of delivery of a controlled substance to a minor, in violation 
  of Florida Statutes 893.13(4)(a), as set out in counts 1, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 
  16 of superseding information number 02-61437-CFA". Thus, the Minister 
  has stated the offences for which the appellant is being surrendered in clear 
  terms. The surrender order provides sufficient detail to avoid the prosecution 
  of the appellant for crimes other than those for which surrender was ordered. 
  The real issue in this case, it seems to me, is not one involving specialty 
  but whether the surrender order was consistent with the order of committal. 
  This is a matter I will consider when dealing with the application for judicial 
  review.</p>
<p>
  [18] With respect to the argument based on the need for notice of the case to 
  meet, it is my view that in this case, when the Authority to Proceed is read 
  with the Record of the Case, the appellant had notice of the case he had to 
  meet. The Authority to Proceed describes the conduct by reference to the corresponding 
  Canadian offence and the time frame. Also, in the case of the drug offences, 
  the drug is specified, and in the case of the sexual offence, the victim is 
  specified. The Record of the Case provides the appellant with notice of the 
  alleged conduct. It is true that the Record of the Case sets out a number of 
  incidents that could constitute the offence. This does not, however, affect 
  the sufficiency of the Authority to Proceed. Even an accused in Canada facing 
  a domestic charge of sexual assault or drug trafficking could find that he or 
  she is facing an information alleging that the offence was committed over a 
  period of time. Such an information would not necessarily be invalid because 
  the evidence adduced by the Crown showed that there were a number of incidents 
  over that period of time. See for example, R. v. M. (G.L.) (1999), 138 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 383 (B.C.C.A.) and R. v. Selles (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 332 (C.A.) at 339-41.</p>
<p>
  [19] In this case, the appellant knew the nature of the allegations against 
  him. In effect, it was alleged that he engaged in a course of conduct that consisted 
  of supplying juveniles with illegal drugs and other substances and engaging 
  in sexual conduct with them during this time period. This is not a case like 
  United States of America v. Drysdale, [2000] O.J. No. 214 (S.C.J.), where the 
  facts set out in the Record of the Case disclosed a number of different types 
  of conduct of strikingly different levels of severity. In Drysdale, the Authority 
  to Proceed simply listed a number of offences such as "conspiracy to export 
  hashish" without reference to date and, it seems, the Record of the Case 
  described "facts that give rise to numerous possible conspiracy offences, 
  some broad, some narrow, some national, and some international". In that 
  case, Dambrot J. had the counsel for the requesting state "specify what 
  offences were actually intended to be considered". In that way, the persons 
  knew what case they had to meet.</p>
<p>
  [20] It may be that where the Record of the Case sets out conduct showing a 
  number of different transactions of very different levels of severity which, 
  however, would all technically fall within the description of the Authority 
  to Proceed, and the extradition judge finds that only certain of the transactions 
  were made out, the judge could include his findings in his report to the Minister 
  under s. 38(1) of the Act: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A judge who issues an order of committal of a person to await surrender shall 
  transmit to the Minister the following documents: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) a copy of the order; </p>
<p class="indent">(b) a copy of the evidence adduced at the hearing that has not 
  already been transmitted to the Minister; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) any report that the judge thinks fit.</p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant was entitled to a fair extradition hearing: United States 
  of America v. Cobb, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 587 at para. 33. I am satisfied that the 
  absence of particulars did not deprive the appellant of a fair hearing. As I 
  have said, the appellant knew the case against him. I would leave for another 
  day a fuller consideration of the exact parameters of the Charter guarantee 
  to the right to know the case in the extradition context, as well as whether 
  the extradition judge has the jurisdiction to require particulars to an Authority 
  to Proceed that otherwise meets the minimum statutory requirements. See United 
  States of America v. Kavaratzis, [2004] O.J. No. 173 (C.A.) at para. 25. </p>
<p> [22] That said, I would encourage the Minister to be as specific as possible 
  in drafting the Authority to Proceed. While the Authority to Proceed is not 
  a charging document in the sense of an indictment or information,<a href="#1">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a> 
  it is the foundation for the judicial phase of the proceedings, and greater 
  precision will assist in expediting those proceedings. With a more carefully 
  crafted document, the parties and the judge will have a better understanding 
  of the real matters in issue and can direct their attention to those matters 
  accordingly. Greater precision will also assist at the executive phase of the 
  proceedings, when the Minister of Justice comes to draft the surrender order.</p>
<p>
  [23] I would make one last comment. The appellant submitted that the extradition 
  judge erred in failing to dismiss the Authority to Proceed because the Attorney 
  General failed to produce the American charging documents. I agree with the 
  extradition judge that there is no requirement to produce the charging document 
  from the extradition partner. One of the important aspects of the Authority 
  to Proceed procedure was to do away with the need for the judge to refer to 
  the foreign charging documents. The extradition judge is not concerned with 
  foreign law. See United States of America v. Kavaratzis, at para. 17.</p>
<p>
  Proof of holding out</p>
<p>
  [24] The appellant submits that there was insufficient evidence in the Record 
  of the Case to show that he held out the substances that he provided to the 
  juveniles as ecstasy or cocaine. In light of my conclusion below concerning 
  the ecstasy charge, I need only consider this submission as it applies to the 
  cocaine. It is the case that there is no direct evidence in the sense of statements 
  attributed to the appellant where he represented that the substance was cocaine. 
  There was, however, circumstantial evidence of holding out. This included the 
  evidence that the juveniles believed the substance to be cocaine and ingested 
  it as if it was cocaine. I would not give effect to this submission.</p>
<p>
  Proof the substance was held out as a controlled drug</p>
<p>
  [25] As I have pointed out, the Authority to Proceed alleges that one of the 
  Canadian offences corresponding to the conduct alleged against the appellant 
  is: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Trafficking in N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine), 
  a substance represented or held out to be ecstasy (between February 1, 2002 
  and April 15, 2002), contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances 
  Act.</p>
<p>
  [26] On a charge of trafficking by holding out it is not necessary that the 
  prosecution establish that the drug supplied by the accused was in fact a controlled 
  drug under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The prosecution does, however, 
  have to prove that the accused held out the substance as a controlled drug within 
  the meaning of the Act, i.e. that the drug as held out can be found in one of 
  the Schedules to the Act. The allegation in this case is that the appellant 
  held the substance out as ecstasy. Ecstasy (unlike cocaine or heroin, for example) 
  is not named in the Schedules to the Act. The Authority to Proceed seeks to 
  fill that gap by reference to the chemical name, N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine 
  (N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine), which is found in Schedule 
  3 to the Act. That schedule does not, however, state that this substance is 
  ecstasy. The Attorney General therefore had to adduce some evidence to show 
  that the appellant held out N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine).</p>
<p>
  [27] The Record of the Case is replete with references to "ecstasy". 
  There is, however, no evidence that ecstasy is N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine 
  (N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine). To the contrary, the Record 
  of the Case sets out that the appellant supplied the juveniles with "methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine, 
  otherwise known as ecstasy", but methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine is not 
  listed as a controlled substance in the Schedules to the Controlled Drugs and 
  Substances Act.</p>
<p>
  [28] The appellant submits that the extradition judge erred in ordering his 
  committal in the absence of any evidence that the substance held out as ecstasy 
  was a controlled substance. The extradition judge dealt with this issue as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I take little cognizance of the fact that the scientific terms in related offence 
  #2 do not exactly correspond with those listed in the Schedules to the Act. 
  Clearly, both ecstasy and cocaine are found in the Schedules to the Act and 
  they are controlled substances. [Para. 22 of [2003] O.J. No. 1655.]</p>
<p> [29] In my view, this case falls within this court's decision in R. v. Bollers 
  (1979), 52 C.C.C. (2d) 62.<a href="#1">[3]</a><a name="r3"></a> In that case, 
  the accused was charged with trafficking "in a substance represented or held 
  out by him to be a Narcotic, to wit: Cannabis sativa, its preparations, derivatives 
  and similar synthetic preparations, namely Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)". The 
  evidence was that the accused sold a substance to an undercover officer which 
  he represented to be THC. The evidence from another police officer, however, 
  was that the THC "which they sell on the street is not THC, but PCP which is 
  a narcotic". In those circumstances, the court held that the charge had not 
  been made out. Speaking for the court, Houlden J.A. said the following at pp. 
  63-4: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Having alleged that the appellant represented or held out that the substance 
  trafficked in was tetrahydrocannabinol, the Crown had the onus of proving that 
  this substance was that drug: see R. v. Merritt (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 156 at 
  p. 160, 11 N.B. (2d) 393, and R. v. Gladstone and Rodriguez (1977), 37 C.C.C. 
  (2d) 185.</p>
<p>
  [30] Taken at face value, the evidence in the Record of the Case is not that 
  the appellant held out a controlled drug but that he held out something called 
  methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine, which, as I have said, does not appear to be 
  a controlled drug in Canada.</p>
<p>
  [31] I have considered whether it is open to this court to take judicial notice 
  that the "ecstasy" referred to in the Record of the Case is indeed 
  N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (N,alpha-dimethyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanamine), 
  notwithstanding the evidence in the Record of the Case. The court may take judicial 
  notice of "any fact or matter which is so generally known and accepted 
  that it cannot reasonably be questioned, or any fact or matter which can readily 
  be determined or verified by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably 
  be questioned". See R. v. Potts (1982), 36 O.R. (2d) 195 (C.A.) at p. 201.</p>
<p>
  [32] I am not persuaded that the chemical composition of ecstasy falls within 
  the first category as a fact that is so generally known and accepted that it 
  cannot reasonably be questioned. As to resort to sources of unquestioned accuracy, 
  the respondent did not refer us to any such source. A quick search of the Internet 
  produces only conflicting information. Thus, the Centre for Addiction &amp; 
  Mental Health, a well-known Canadian institution affiliated with the University 
  of Toronto, describes ecstasy in these terms: </p>
<p class="indent"> Ecstasy is a drug that has some hallucinogenic properties and 
  is structurally related to amphetamines. Ecstasy can produce a mild intoxication, 
  a strong sense of pleasure, and feelings of euphoria. However, Ecstasy has also 
  been known to have negative and disturbing effects. Its short form chemical 
  name is MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). Among the other names Ecstasy 
  goes by are E, XTC, Adam, Euphoria, X, MDM, and Love Doves.<a href="#1">[4]</a><a name="r4"></a> 
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
</p>
<p> [33] Without expert evidence I do not see how this court is in a position 
  to determine whether the difference between the description in Schedule 3 and 
  the Authority to Proceed, "methylenedioxyamphetamine", and the description from 
  the Centre, "methylenedioxymethamphetamine", is significant. Of course, in this 
  case there is the added complexity that what may be passing as ecstasy in Florida 
  may not be the same substance being passed off as ecstasy in Canada. For what 
  it is worth, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) (part of the United 
  States National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services) 
  describes ecstasy in terms similar to those used by the Centre: "MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine)". 
  <a href="#1">[5]</a><a name="r5"></a></p>
<p>
  [34] The respondent referred us to the decision of Hill J. in R. v. Hoang, [2002] 
  O.J. No. 1355 (S.C.J.) at para. 28: </p>
<p class="indent">
  N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine or MDMA is commonly referred to as ecstasy. 
  The drug is a derivative of amphetamine differing by the presence of a methylenedioxy 
  group attached to the phenyl ring which gives MDMA pharmacological properties 
  intermediate between those of amphetamine and of the hallucinogenic drug mescaline.</p>
<p>
  [35] I note, however, that the issue in Hoang was sentence and, more importantly, 
  that Hill J. had the benefit of a report from a noted professor of pharmacology. 
  No similar material was filed in the extradition proceedings or sought to be 
  adduced in this court.</p>
<p>
  [36] Accordingly, I would discharge the appellant on the ecstasy offence in 
  the Authority to Proceed. </p>
<p>
  The constitutional issue</p>
<p>
  [37] Before the extradition judge and in this court, the appellant argued that 
  he should be discharged on the drug charges because "give" in the 
  definition of traffic in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act is unconstitutional. 
  In short, the appellant submits that the offence of trafficking by giving violates 
  s. 7 of the Charter. I need not set out the appellant's submissions on this 
  issue since, in my view, the evidence in the Record of the Case shows that the 
  appellant trafficked by means other than simply giving. The evidence shows that 
  the appellant transported the drugs to distribute them to several juveniles 
  on many occasions. This conduct falls within the established definition of trafficking 
  by distribution and transporting. See for example R. v. Gardiner (1987), 35 
  C.C.C. (3d) 461 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Cole (1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 416 (C.A.), 
  leave to appeal refused [1982] 1 S.C.R. vii.</p>
<p>
  Judicial Review</p>
<p>
  Sufficiency of the Authority to Proceed</p>
<p>
  [38] The alleged insufficiency of the Authority to Proceed also arises in the 
  context of the application for judicial review of the decision of the Minister 
  to surrender the appellant. As I have indicated, in this case the Minister made 
  the surrender order, under s. 58(b) of the Act, by describing the offences in 
  respect of which the extradition is requested. Thus, the surrender order with 
  respect to the drug charges reads in part as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  for the offences of 1) Six counts of delivery of a controlled substance to a 
  minor, in violation of Florida Statutes 893.13(4)(a), as set out in counts 1, 
  8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 of superseding information number 02-61437-CFA</p>
<p>
  [39] The appellant submits that the Minister had no jurisdiction to surrender 
  the appellant on six counts since the Authority to Proceed only lists two drug 
  offences. In effect, he submits that the surrender order must track those parts 
  of the Authority to Proceed upon which the extradition judge made a committal 
  order.</p>
<p>
  [40] I would not give effect to this submission. In my view, s. 58 contemplates 
  that the wording of the surrender can differ from the wording of the Authority 
  to Proceed. At the surrender stage of the proceedings, the Minister may consider 
  the foreign law. It is for the Minister to determine whether the offences for 
  which extradition is sought falls within the scope of the Authority to Proceed 
  and the committal order.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p> [41] Ignoring the exception in s. 59 of the Act<a href="#1">[6]</a><a name="r6"></a> 
  and the complication of specific extradition arrangements, my understanding 
  of the relationship between committal and surrender is as follows. Section 3 
  of the Act provides, in part, that a person may be extradited from Canada if, 
  inter alia, "the conduct of the person, had it occurred in Canada, would have 
  constituted an offence that is punishable in Canada" by, for example, imprisonment 
  for a maximum of two years. Under s. 15, the Minister of Justice, after receiving 
  a request for extradition, issues an Authority to Proceed to the Attorney General 
  that, inter alia contains the name of the offence under Canadian law that corresponds 
  to the "alleged" conduct. Thus, the Minister designates the Canadian offence. 
  The Minister does not, however, determine whether in fact the alleged conduct 
  would have constituted an offence in Canada. The Authority to Proceed is framed 
  in the first executive phase of the proceedings. Whether the allegation has 
  been made out is the judicial function.</p>
<p>
  [42] Under s. 29, the extradition judge orders the committal of the person to 
  await surrender if inter alia "there is evidence admissible under this 
  Act of conduct that, had it occurred in Canada, would justify committal for 
  trial in Canada on the offence set out in the Authority to Proceed". After 
  the judicial phase is completed, the Minister must make the surrender decision 
  in accordance with ss. 58 to 65. Leaving aside a relevant extradition agreement, 
  and s. 59 of the Act, the Minister is bound by the terms of s. 3 and can only 
  surrender if the conduct of the person, had it occurred in Canada, would have 
  constituted a Canadian offence. The factual part of that issue was determined 
  by the extradition judge. </p>
<p>
  [43] As I see it, where, as here, the Minister decides to draft the surrender 
  order by reference to the description of the offence in respect of which the 
  extradition is requested, his task is to compare the terms of the Authority 
  to Proceed upon which the committal was made with the foreign charges. It may 
  be that, as is apparently the case here, the Authority to Proceed is broad enough 
  to embrace more than one "count" in the foreign charging document. 
  That determination is, subject to judicial review by a court of appeal, for 
  the Minister in the second executive phase of the process.</p>
<p>
  [44] The final judicial phase takes place where the person applies to a court 
  of appeal for judicial review. The grounds for judicial review are set out in 
  s. 57(7) which provides that the court of appeal may grant relief on any of 
  the grounds on which the Federal Court may grant relief under subsection 18.1(4) 
  of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7. Section 18.1(4) provides as 
  follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Federal Court may grant relief under subsection (3) if 
  it is satisfied that the federal board, commission or other tribunal</p>
<p class="indent">(a) acted without jurisdiction, acted beyond its jurisdiction 
  or refused to exercise its jurisdiction; </p>
<p class="indent">(b) failed to observe a principle of natural justice, procedural 
  fairness or other procedure that it was required by law to observe; </p>
<p class="indent">(c) erred in law in making a decision or an order, whether or 
  not the error appears on the face of the record; </p>
<p class="indent">(d) based its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact 
  that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material 
  before it; </p>
<p class="indent">(e) acted, or failed to act, by reason of fraud or perjured 
  evidence; or</p>
<p class="indent">(f) acted in any other way that was contrary to law.</p>
<p>
  [45] It would seem to me that, leaving aside specific extradition arrangements 
  and s. 59, if the Minister ordered the surrender of a person for an offence 
  that did not come within the conduct described in the committal order, he would 
  have acted without jurisdiction. However, the onus is on the applicant for judicial 
  review to show that the Minister acted without jurisdiction. The appellant in 
  this case has not met that burden. Although he could have done so, the appellant 
  has made no effort to obtain the foreign charging documents, nor to provide 
  any information to cast doubt on the Minister's decision. </p>
<p>
  [46] This case may be contrasted with the decision of the British Columbia Court 
  of Appeal in United States of America v. Reumayr (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 377. 
  In Reumayr, the Authority to Proceed set out a number of offences concerning 
  possession of explosives, and offences of attempted arson and attempted mischief. 
  The extradition judge ordered the committal of the person only on the possession 
  charges. The surrender order, however, referred to "attempting to bomb 
  the Trans-Alaska Pipeline by means of explosive devices" in violation of 
  specific sections of the United States Code as charged in the U.S. District 
  Court indictment. Mackenzie J.A. speaking for the court at para. 42 held that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he statutory scheme does not authorize extradition for offences that substantively 
  exceed the offences that are supported in the committal proceedings. It would 
  defeat the purpose of the committal hearing if the Minister's discretion extended 
  to surrender for offences substantively beyond those supported by evidence at 
  the committal hearing.</p>
<p>
  [47] He therefore held that the surrender order was deficient and should be 
  set aside in the absence of some explanation for the difference between the 
  committal order and the surrender order. He set out his reasons for this disposition 
  at para. 43: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In this case, the Minister's reasons are silent on the apparent inconsistency 
  between the offences in the committal order and those in the surrender order. 
  If the difference here is simply a difference in characterization of the offence 
  of attempt between Canada and the United States rather than a difference in 
  substance between the request offences and the committal offences, I think that 
  the statutory scheme requires that the Minister give reasons that support the 
  difference as only a "named, defined or characterized" difference. 
  If the difference is substantive then the surrender order is too broad. In the 
  absence of an adequate explanation for the inconsistency, I think that the surrender 
  order is deficient. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [48] In this case, the appellant rests his argument solely on the basis that 
  the surrender order contains more offences than did the Authority to Proceed. 
  In my view, the mere fact that there are more offences set out in the surrender 
  order than in the committal order is not proof that the Minister acted without 
  jurisdiction. I would therefore not give effect to this submission.</p>
<p>
  Failure to consider relevant factors</p>
<p>
  [49] Finally, the appellant submits that the Minister failed to consider relevant 
  factors. To understand this submission it is necessary to return to the facts 
  and in particular the personal circumstances of the appellant. The appellant 
  was born in Kuwait on November 12, 1974. He is the child of Palestinian refugees 
  and, notwithstanding that he was born in Kuwait, he cannot hold Kuwaiti citizenship. 
  During the first Gulf War in 1990, the appellant, who was then 16 years of age, 
  and his family fled Kuwait. The family went to Lebanon, where they were permitted 
  to live as refugees. The appellant alleges that Palestinian refugees live in 
  "appallingly oppressive conditions" in Lebanon. After five months, 
  the family left for the United States. Some members of the family have come 
  to Canada where they have made refugee claims. Most of those members who remained 
  in the United States seem to have been able to regularize their immigration 
  status. For example, the appellant's father is now an American citizen and his 
  younger brother has a "green card". The appellant has not regularized 
  his American immigration status. The appellant states that he cannot return 
  to Kuwait. </p>
<p> [50] In December 2001, the appellant was arrested by American authorities, 
  held for two weeks, and then released. He claims that this was a consequence 
  of new security measures following the tragedy of September 11, 2001. The appellant 
  has a criminal record in the United States for four misdemeanour battery convictions. 
  After his arrest in Canada on the extradition warrant, the appellant made a 
  refugee claim.<a href="#1">[7]</a><a name="r7"></a> </p>
<p>
  [51] On the basis of this background, the appellant asked the Minister to refuse 
  surrender. His argument went as follows. In light of the new security measures 
  in the United States, were he to be surrendered the appellant would probably 
  be held as a security threat, even though he is not one. The appellant says 
  that he is a "stateless person", and would therefore be held indefinitely. 
  Alternatively, he might be deported to Lebanon, since that country will accept 
  Palestinian refugees, but the conditions there are intolerable and he has no 
  connection with that country. The appellant submits that this state of affairs 
  would shock the conscience and violate his s. 7 Charter rights.</p>
<p>
  [52] In his reasons for decision to surrender the appellant, the Minister set 
  out all of the circumstances recorded above and concluded that "there is 
  nothing in Mr. Saad's personal circumstances that would be unjust or oppressive 
  or 'shock the conscience' if he were to be surrendered to face trial in the 
  United States". The Minister also rejected the submission that the appellant 
  faces the risk of indefinite detention in the United States. In reaching that 
  conclusion, the Minister said that he took into account the conclusion reached 
  by Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC) "that there is no substantial 
  ground to believe that Mr. Saad will face torture and it is unlikely that he 
  will face cruel, degrading, or inhumane treatment if returned to the United 
  States". CIC also advised the Minister that they were "not aware of 
  any serious risk that Mr. Saad will be persecuted if he is returned to the United 
  States". Finally, the Minister stated that there is no reason to believe 
  that there is a serious risk that if he were deported to Lebanon the appellant 
  would face persecution, and commented that "it is unlikely that he will 
  face cruel, degrading, or inhumane treatment".</p>
<p> [53] I have reviewed the material provided by the appellant to the Minister. 
  That material consists of press releases, press clippings, and reports from 
  Amnesty International and others concerning the treatment in the United States 
  of non-citizens of Arab or Muslim background following September 11, 2001. Also 
  included is information relating to the detention of a refugee from Haiti by 
  the United States Attorney General. Unquestionably, this material raises some 
  concerns. The difficulty for the appellant, as I see it, is in linking this 
  information with the treatment of the appellant upon his return. Aside from 
  the two-week detention in December 2001, there is nothing to show that this 
  appellant would be a person of interest to the national security apparatus in 
  the United States. His allegation that he would be held indefinitely, both as 
  a security risk and because he is a stateless person, is belied by his counsel's 
  submissions to the Minister that the appellant "believes that he was released 
  and not deported because, as a stateless person, there is no country to which 
  he can be properly deported". If that was the state of affairs in the immediate 
  aftermath of September 11, 2001, it is difficult to understand why there should 
  be such a dramatic change now. In any event, I cannot say that the Minister's 
  finding, based on the CIC review, is unreasonable, or in the terms of s. 18.1 
  of the Federal Courts Act, perverse or capricious.</p>
<p>
  [54] As to the prospect of the appellant's return to Lebanon, the material submitted 
  by the appellant to the Minister is sparse. He relies, for example, on a report 
  from Amnesty International that thousands of Palestinian refugees living in 
  camps in Lebanon continue to face systemic discrimination, restriction on their 
  freedom of movement and restriction from entering some professions. Again, however, 
  the link to the appellant is missing. The appellant has not provided any information 
  about how he was treated when he and his family were in Lebanon following the 
  first Gulf War, or any information to suggest that he would be persecuted in 
  Lebanon. In my view, it was not unreasonable in these circumstances for the 
  Minister to rely on the information from CIC. Despite the appellant's plea that 
  as a "Westernized young man" he will end up in a country where he 
  has few, if any, family ties, I cannot say that the Minister was wrong in finding 
  that this would not violate his s. 7 rights. As the Minister points out in his 
  letter, the test under s. 7 is a strict one; it must involve circumstances that 
  would be "simply unacceptable" or that sufficiently shock the conscience 
  as to violate the s. 7 right not to be denied life, liberty and security of 
  the person except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice: 
  See Pacificador v. Canada (Minister of Justice) (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 685 (C.A.), 
  leave to appeal dismissed [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 390, at paras. 44, 55 and 56. 
</p>
<p>
  [55] I would not give effect to this submission.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [56] I would allow the appeal from the extradition order and set aside the committal 
  on the ecstasy count in the Authority to Proceed. In view of that disposition, 
  it is necessary to set aside the Minister's determination since the surrender 
  order was based on the three offences in the Authority to Proceed. Pursuant 
  to s. 57(6)(b) of the Act I would therefore set aside the Minister's decision 
  to surrender the appellant and refer it back for determination in light of the 
  decision concerning the ecstasy count. No doubt the Minister will entertain 
  submissions from the appellant on whether there should be a surrender order 
  in light of the changed circumstances.</p>
