<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant, Saved By Technology Rentals Inc. seeks to set aside the 
  summary judgment granted by Justice Karakatsanis dated January 30, 2004, dismissing 
  its claim that a certain mortgage was extinguished and granting the respondent, 
  Reta Thomas, possession.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant argues the mortgage has been extinguished by operation of 
  the ten-year limitation period that applies to actions to recover possession 
  and title on a mortgage: see the Limitations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15, s.15. 
  It submits that because there is no provision in the standard terms of the mortgage 
  - incorporated therein by virtue of the Land Registration Reform Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. L.4 - specifically granting the mortgagor the right to quiet possession 
  absent default, the mortgagee is entitled at common law to take possession at 
  any time; therefore the limitation period should run from the time the mortgage 
  was signed not from the time of default.</p>
<p> [3] In this case, the mortgage was entered into on November 23, 1988. Its 
  terms were somewhat unusual in that it provided for no payment of principal 
  or interest for at least ten years. Default occurred in December 1999. The action 
  was not commenced until February 2003.</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant's submissions are grounded in the difference between the standard 
  terms governing mortgages in Ontario until 1984, under the Short Form of Mortgages 
  Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 474, and those governing mortgages since that time under 
  the Land Registration Reform Act. The former contained terms expressly providing 
  that until default, the mortgagor may have quiet possession and that upon default 
  the mortgagee may do so. The latter only contains a stipulation that the mortgagee 
  has the right of possession after notice and default. </p>
<p>
  [5] The effect of the appellant's argument is to deprive the mortgagee of any 
  right to recover for default in payment of principal or interest because the 
  limitation period, on its submission, would already have expired by the time 
  any such default occurred. The law cannot be so absurd and nonsensical. </p>
<p>
  [6] In careful and thorough reasons Justice Karakatsanis rejected the appellant's 
  arguments. She analyzed the legislation, and the common law history on the question, 
  and concluded that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The only logical and sensible way to interpret s. 7 of the LRRA, and the Standard 
  Charge Terms, is to presume that the mortgagee does not have the right of possession 
  unless the terms regarding notice and default have been complied with. </p>
<p> It followed that the respondent mortgagee could only exercise a right to possession 
  upon the default of the appellant, and therefore that the ten-year limitation 
  period for an action for possession against the appellant began to run only 
  upon its default under the mortgage in December 1999. The action was not statute 
  barred.</p>
<p>
  [7] We agree with the motions judge's interpretation and conclusion and the 
  appeal is dismissed for the reasons she gave.</p>
<p>
  [8] The respondent is entitled to her costs of the appeal, fixed in the amount 
  of $5,000 inclusive of fees, disbursements and GST.</p>
