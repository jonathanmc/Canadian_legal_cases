<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] With respect to Mark Huynh, having regard to the trial judge's findings 
  as to his degree of complicity and his personal circumstances, we think it was 
  open to the trial judge to impose the sentence he did. </p>
<p>[2] With respect to John Sbrolla, the issue is whether a reformatory sentence 
  was available. While the case is close to the line, we think it was open to 
  the trial judge to conclude that a maximum term in the reformatory was a viable 
  sentencing option.</p>
<p>[3] That said, having regard to the seriousness of the offence and the respondent's 
  involvement in it, the sentence should have been custodial. However, given the 
  passage of time and the fact that the extensive community service order has 
  been completed, along with the respondent's personal circumstances as outlined 
  by the trial judge, we would not interfere at this stage.</p>
<p>[4] With respect to the treatment of the criminal organization charge, these 
  are unique circumstances, especially in light of the joint submission of the 
  parties which essentially invited the trial judge to consider the criminal organization 
  offence as a mere aggravating factor. It follows that we do not see this as 
  an appropriate case for setting out the relevant principles of sentencing regarding 
  that charge. </p>
<p>[5] Accordingly, while leave to appeal the sentences is granted, the appeals 
  are dismissed.</p>
