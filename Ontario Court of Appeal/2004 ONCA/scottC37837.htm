<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] On her appeal from the order of the extradition judge committing her for 
  surrender, the appellant raises only the constitutionality of the new Extradition 
  Act. This issue was decided adversely to her by this court in United States 
  of America v. Yang (2001), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 225. The appeal is therefore dismissed. 
</p>
<p>[2] On the application for judicial review, the applicant contends that the 
  Minister erred in surrendering her because to do so would be unfair and oppressive. 
  Linked to this contention, the applicant complains of the inadequacy of the 
  Minister's reasons. </p>
<p>[3] In our view, nothing in the record sustains the applicant's bald assertions 
  which she argues should have led the Minister to refuse surrender. To the extent 
  any of the applicant's allegations had any substance, the Minister gave brief, 
  but appropriate reasons for rejecting them. In our view, the Minister's reasons 
  were adequate having regard to the nature of the complaints and the very limited 
  material to support them. </p>
<p>[4] The application for judicial review is dismissed. </p>
