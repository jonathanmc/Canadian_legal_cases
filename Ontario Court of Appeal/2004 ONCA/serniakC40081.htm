<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] In our view, the motions judge erred in concluding that Ms. Serniak did 
  not acquiesce in Mr. Teitel's alleged conflict of interest and breach of fiduciary 
  duty and in concluding that it is not possible by conduct to waive rights with 
  respect to such a conflict and such a breach. </p>
<p>
  [2] This is not a case of "mere delay". Even assuming that there was 
  such a conflict or breach, Ms. Serniak's active participation for a period of 
  4&frac12; years through 19 days of assessment hearing reasonably leads to the 
  conclusion that she acquiesced in Mr. Teitel's conduct. It was not open to her 
  at the end of that period to raise the issue for the first time: Louie v. Lastman 
  (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 459 at paras. 16?18. Throughout the enforcement and assessment 
  proceedings, she has from time to time had the benefit of legal counsel. She 
  has offered no explanation for her delay in raising the issue of conflict of 
  interest or breach of fiduciary duty in the assessment proceedings, a delay 
  which has caused demonstrable prejudice to the integrity of the assessment process 
  in general and to Mr. Teitel in particular. </p>
<p>
  [3] Although it is not necessary for us to deal with the remaining grounds of 
  appeal, we do not wish to be taken as agreeing with the motions judge that a 
  conflict of interest creates an absolute bar to the payment of a solicitor's 
  fees. In our view, such a determination must necessarily depend, in any particular 
  case, on the nature of the conflict and the circumstances before the court. 
  </p>
<p>
  [4] The appeal is allowed. The order of Wilson J. is set aside. The assessment 
  is to proceed without consideration of the allegations of conflict of interest 
  and breach of fiduciary duty. In all of the circumstances, we are of the opinion 
  that there should be no order for costs either before Wilson J. or in this court.
