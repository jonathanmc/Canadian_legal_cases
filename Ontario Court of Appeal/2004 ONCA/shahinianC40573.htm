<p>On appeal from the judgment of Regional Senior Justice Robert A. Blair of the 
  Superior Court of Justice dated August 6, 2003.</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  GOUDGE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal by Precinda Inc. from the order of Blair J. declaring 
  that it is in breach of the redemption obligation in its Articles of Amalgamation 
  and that the respondent is entitled to immediate redemption of his 1,600,000 
  Class X preference shares in the appellant for the sum of $1,600,000.</p>
<p>
  [2] The respondent acquired his preference shares pursuant to a restructuring 
  of the business affairs of the appellant company. That restructuring was effected 
  through a series of agreements made on January 31, 2002. One of these, the Amalgamation 
  Agreement, established that the redemption rights of Class X preference shareholders 
  were unconditional, requiring only thirty days notice to the appellant. However, 
  in another of these agreements, the Shareholders' Agreement, the respondent 
  agreed that the appellant was not required to redeem Class X preference shares 
  except in three specified circumstances. The second of these exceptions was 
  the failure of the appellant to remedy a default in the payment of dividends 
  on Class X preference shares. The meaning of that exception lies at the heart 
  of this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [3] Commencing with the dividend due on September 30, 2002, the appellant refused 
  to pay quarterly dividends to the respondent on his Class X preference shares, 
  although it had the funds to do so, because it was concerned that the respondent 
  was acting in breach of his confidentiality and non-compete obligations to the 
  appellant company.</p>
<p>
  [4] Blair J. found that there was no evidence of any such breaches and that 
  these non- payments constituted a default in payment as contemplated by the 
  second exception to the restriction on the respondent's right of redemption. 
  He therefore declared that the respondent was entitled to immediate redemption 
  of all his Class X preference shares. </p>
<p>
  [5] In this court, the appellant acknowledges that if the second exception applies 
  the respondent has the right to redeem all his Class X preference shares. However, 
  the appellant argues that the exception must be read in the context of the two 
  other exceptions and the other agreements which make up the restructuring. It 
  argues that the respondent's interpretation of the exception results in a commercial 
  absurdity. The appellant says that the exception is meant to be confined to 
  those circumstances where the appellant, although not insolvent, is sufficiently 
  lacking in funds that it reasonably believes it would not be able to pay its 
  liabilities as they came due if the dividends were paid. The appellant says 
  that since these circumstances do not exist here, Blair J. erred in according 
  the respondent the right to redeem.</p>
<p>
  [6] For the reasons that follow, we disagree with these arguments. Rather, we 
  agree with Blair J. that the exception properly applies and we would therefore 
  dismiss the appeal. </p>
<p>
  FACTS </p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant, Precinda Inc., owns 100 percent of the shares of Precinda 
  Ltd., which is in the business of machining component parts for aircraft engines, 
  power generators, combustion turbines and plastic injection moulding machines. 
  Its key customers include Siemens Westinghouse, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and Rolls 
  Royce. </p>
<p>
  [8] The business was purchased by John Kololian in 1984. In 1985 he brought 
  his sister, Nairy Shahinian, and her husband, Eddy Shahinian, into the business 
  and in 1987 Hrair Shahinian, Eddy's brother, the respondent, joined it as well. 
  Each of them acquired shares in the appellant's predecessor, which were converted 
  into common shares and Class X Preference shares in the appellant company by 
  the Amalgamation Agreement. </p>
<p>
  [9] By 2001 strains had developed in the working relationships and the restructuring 
  of January 31, 2002 was effected. Kololian would purchase the common shares 
  of the appellant owned by the other three and thereby take sole control of the 
  business. He also agreed to purchase all of the respondent's Class X preference 
  shares over time in accordance with a schedule. The number of preference shares 
  to be purchased in any given year depended on the financial performance of the 
  business. Quarterly dividends were to be paid on the Class X preference shares 
  at the annual rate of 5.714 percent of the price at which these shares could 
  be redeemed (which was fixed at $1.00 per share). Finally, the respondent agreed 
  to stay on as president of the operating company, Precinda Ltd., until April 
  30, 2002. </p>
<p>
  [10] On June 12, 2002 the respondent told Kololian that he would be meeting 
  with a former contact at Siemens Westinghouse to discuss investment and new 
  business opportunities that did not relate to and were not competitive with 
  the appellant. Kololian was upset at this and wanted to know the details of 
  what the respondent would be discussing. The respondent says that he was forthright 
  and invited Kololian to join him but the latter refused.</p>
<p>
  [11] Then in September Kololian learned that the respondent had also met with 
  former contacts who had brought in Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls Royce. He demanded 
  to know what business had been discussed. The respondent again assured him that 
  he was not pursuing any competitive initiatives but refused to disclose the 
  nature of his discussions.</p>
<p>
  [12] While there was no evidence that the respondent was in breach of his confidentiality 
  or non-compete obligations to the appellant, starting in September 2002 Kololian 
  stopped the appellant's quarterly dividend payments to the respondent on his 
  Class X preference shares, despite the fact that those dividends were properly 
  declared by the appellant's board of directors. The company was financially 
  able to pay them and they were in fact paid to the respondent's brother and 
  his wife, who were also Class X preference shareholders. </p>
<p>
  [13] As a result, the respondent commenced this application, seeking inter alia 
  a declaration of immediate entitlement to payment of the overdue quarterly dividends 
  and a declaration of entitlement to immediate redemption of all his Class X 
  preference shares.</p>
<p>
  [14] While Blair J. granted both declarations, only the second is being appealed. 
  The appellant acknowledges that since the quarterly dividends were properly 
  declared and it was financially able to pay them, the dividends should have 
  been paid to the respondent. However, the appellant says that this is all that 
  the respondent is entitled to and that no right of redemption was triggered 
  by the failure to pay. </p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  [15] A number of provisions of the agreements that effected the restructuring 
  of January 31, 2002 are relevant to this issue. </p>
<p>
  [16] First, the obligation to pay quarterly dividends to Class X preference 
  shareholders is provided for in the Articles of Amalgamation, whose terms are 
  found in Schedule 1 to the Amalgamation Agreement. This obligation reads as 
  follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 2. Dividends</p>
<p class="indent">Subject to the [Ontario Business Corporations] Act, the holders 
  of the Class X Preference Shares shall in each financial year of the Corporation 
  be entitled to cumulative dividends at the annual rate of 5.714% of the redemption 
  amount per share [$1.00], payable on the Dividend Payment Dates in each year 
  [March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31] , commencing on March 31, 
  2002. The holders of the Class X Preference Shares shall not be entitled to 
  any dividends other than as provided for herein.</p>
<p>
  [17] Second, Schedule 1 also provides for the unconditional right of redemption 
  of Class X preference shares on thirty days notice at the option of the shareholder. 
  </p>
<p>
  [18] Third, the respondent's right to have his Class X preference shares purchased 
  by Kololian is found in his Preferred Share Purchase Agreement with Kololian. 
  Both his brother and his sister-in-law have similar agreements covering their 
  Class X preference shares. The purchase schedule depends on the appellant meeting 
  certain financial targets. The Agreement makes clear that Kololian will fund 
  his purchases by borrowings from the appellant and that if these borrowings 
  put the appellant in breach of any of its bank borrowing arrangements, Kololian's 
  purchase obligations are to that extent reduced.</p>
<p>
  [19] The key provision for this appeal is Article 3.1 in the Shareholders Agreement 
  of January 31, 2002 between inter alia the appellant, the respondent and Kololian. 
  It reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 3.1 Restriction on Redemption at the Option of the Holder of 
  Preference Shares.</p>
<p class="indent">The Parties agree that Precision [the appellant] shall not be 
  required to redeem at the option of any Shareholder any issued and outstanding 
  Class X Preference Shares or Class Z Preference Shares except in the circumstances 
  of (i) a Bankruptcy Event in Vahan [Kololian], Precision or KK [Precinda Ltd.], 
  (ii) the failure of Precision to remedy a default in payment of dividends on 
  the Class X Preference Shares as prescribed in the Articles, within 60 days 
  of such default, or (iii) the failure by Vahan to complete a particular purchase 
  of Class X Preference Shares as required by, and in accordance with, the Preferred 
  Share Purchase Agreement within 60 days of such particular purchase obligation 
  having arisen (it being agreed that any redemption rights arising under (A) 
  the foregoing clauses 3.1(i), and (iii) shall apply only to that number of Class 
  X Preference Shares in respect of which Vahan's purchase obligations under the 
  Preferred Share Purchase Agreement have not been fulfilled, and (B) the foregoing 
  clause 3.1(ii) shall apply to all of the Class X Preference Shares in respect 
  of which Vahan's purchase obligations under the Preferred Share Purchase Agreement 
  have not been fulfilled) [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [20] The appellant's argument before us is somewhat different from that made 
  before Blair J. In this court, the appellant argues that, read in context, the 
  second exception in Article 3.1 applies only where the failure to pay the dividend 
  is because the company, although not insolvent, lacks the funds to do so. The 
  appellant says that it therefore does not apply in the circumstances of this 
  case. It says that the exception is designed to protect the Class X preference 
  shareholder against the kind of circumstance addressed by s. 38(3) of the Ontario 
  Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16 (the "OBCA"). That 
  section reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> (3) When dividend not to be declared - The directors shall 
  not declare and the corporation shall not pay a dividend if there are reasonable 
  grounds for believing that,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the corporation is or, after the payment, would be unable 
  to pay its liabilities as they become due; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the realizable value of the corporation's assets would thereby 
  be less than the aggregate of,</p>
<p class="indent">(i) its liabilities, and</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) its stated capital of all classes.</p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant supports this reading by looking to the first exception in 
  Article 3.1, which is triggered by a bankruptcy event by Kololian, the appellant 
  or Precinda Ltd., and then arguing that the second exception is of similar design, 
  protecting against the situation where the appellant is running out of funds.</p>
<p>
  [22] The appellant argues that the second exception cannot be viewed as analogous 
  to a mortgage provision that renders the entire debt due and payable if an interest 
  payment is missed. It says that the quarterly dividend on Class X preference 
  shares cannot be viewed as interest on the outstanding purchase price of those 
  shares because these dividends are specified to be cumulative dividends, and 
  there is therefore no obligation to declare a dividend each quarter. Hence there 
  is no obligation to pay such a dividend each quarter. The appellant acknowledges 
  that if not paid, the rights of Class X preference shareholders to these dividends 
  would accumulate and would ultimately be owing at least on windup. </p>
<p>
  [23] Finally, the appellant says that unless the second exception is confined 
  as it proposes, the result is a commercial absurdity. By missing a single dividend 
  payment the appellant becomes obliged to redeem all Class X preference shares 
  regardless of its financial ability to do so. The appellant says that no rational 
  business person in Kololian's position would have agreed to such a provision.</p>
<p>
  [24] There is no doubt that this appeal turns on the proper interpretation of 
  the second exception in Article 3.1 of the Shareholders' Agreement. While it 
  is true that the general context of this provision can provide useful assistance 
  in this task, it must begin with the words of the exception and their ordinary 
  meaning. See Kentucky Fried Chicken Canada, a Division of Pepsi-Cola Canada 
  Ltd. v. Scott's Food Services Inc. (1998), 114 O.A.C. 357 at para. 25 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [25] By a plain reading, the exception applies to the failure of the appellant 
  to remedy a default in payment of dividends on the Class X preference shares 
  as prescribed in the Articles of Amalgamation within sixty days of such default. 
  There is no suggestion that the exception is confined to a default due to a 
  particular cause such as the corporation's lack of funds. In its ordinary meaning 
  the exception is triggered by any default, whatever its cause, that remains 
  unremedied for sixty days. </p>
<p>
  [26] Indeed, the language of the exception does not accommodate being read down 
  as the appellant argues. The appellant's obligation to pay dividends on Class 
  X preference shares is expressly made subject to the OBCA by the Articles of 
  Amalgamation. Section 38(3) of the Act prevents the payment of a dividend if 
  there are reasonable grounds to believe that its payment would render the corporation 
  unable to pay its liabilities as they come due. The appellant seeks to confine 
  the exception to a default in payment because of the corporation's lack of funds 
  as described in this section. However, this would mean reading down the circumstances 
  of default in the payment of a dividend contemplated by the second exception 
  in Article 3.1 to extend only to those circumstances in which the legislation 
  prohibits the corporation from paying a dividend. One is not ordinarily described 
  as being in default for failing to do something prohibited by legislation. The 
  parties cannot have intended to limit the exception in this way. </p>
<p>
  [27] Thus, the words used to define the second exception in Article 3.1 cannot 
  be read down as the appellant argues. In their plain and ordinary meaning they 
  encompass all defaults, regardless of their cause, including the default in 
  this case. </p>
<p>
  [28] Nor do the surrounding exceptions suggest otherwise. It is correct to say, 
  as the appellant argues, that the first exception in Article 3.1 is triggered 
  by a "bankruptcy event" by Kololian, the appellant or Precinda Ltd. 
  and is not aimed at their "bloody minded" conduct, to use the appellant's 
  term. However, the third exception clearly encompasses a "bloody minded" 
  failure by Kololian to complete a particular purchase of Class X preference 
  shares from the respondent as called for by the Preferred Share Purchase Agreement. 
  The placement of the second exception between these two does not lead to any 
  inference that a "bloody minded" default in paying a dividend falls 
  outside the exception.</p>
<p>
  [29] Moreover, whether or not the appellant could refuse to declare a "cumulative 
  dividend" in a particular quarter (which we need not decide here), when 
  it does declare a dividend that payment can reasonably be seen as the payment 
  of interest on the outstanding purchase price for the respondent's preference 
  shares. That is particularly so because the amount of the dividend is fixed 
  at the annual rate of 5.714 percent of a fixed redemption price. Viewed in this 
  way, it is not unreasonable that the failure to pay a declared dividend should 
  render the entire debt due and owing.</p>
<p>
  [30] Finally, while this may seem a draconian remedy from the vantage point 
  of the appellant and Kololian, it is commercially reasonable from the respondent's 
  point of view, particularly given that this case was about a "bloody minded" 
  refusal to pay based on a suspicion for which there was no evidence, despite 
  the fact that the appellant had the funds to pay. </p>
<p>
  [31] In summary, we agree with Blair J. that the second exception in Article 
  3.1 of the Shareholders' Agreement is triggered in the circumstances of this 
  case, giving the respondent the immediate right to redeem all his Class X preference 
  shares. </p>
<p>
  [32] The appeal is dismissed, with costs to the respondent fixed at $20,000, 
  inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
