<p>On appeal from the order of Justice John D. Ground of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated March 14, 2003. </p>
<p>
  CATZMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  The appeal</p>
<p>
  [1] The origin of this appeal lies in a civil action, in which the bankrupt 
  was a plaintiff, that was pending at the time he made his assignment in bankruptcy. 
  More than five years after he was discharged, and almost five years after the 
  discharge of his trustee in bankruptcy, the trustee asserted the right to an 
  interest in the action, and solicited offers for its sale. </p>
<p>
  [2] The Deputy Registrar granted the bankrupt's motion for an order that the 
  trustee assign to him all of its interest in the action, and dismissed the trustee's 
  cross-motion for an order authorizing it to accept an offer to purchase that 
  interest. An appeal from the decision of the Deputy Registrar by Gowling Lafleur 
  Henderson LLP ("Gowlings") was allowed by Ground J., who set aside 
  the order of the Deputy Registrar and authorized the trustee to accept Gowlings' 
  offer to purchase the trustee's interest. </p>
<p>
  [3] The bankrupt appeals to this court from the decision of Ground J. For the 
  reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</p>
<p>
  Facts</p>
<p>
  [4] In 1989, before his bankruptcy, Dr. Shelson purchased an interest in a limited 
  partnership as part of a tax-driven real estate investment vehicle. The investment 
  was unsuccessful and, in 1994, eight of the limited partners - including Dr. 
  Shelson - commenced an action against a number of parties, including Gowlings, 
  who were associated with the investment. The statement of claim in that action 
  alleged that Gowlings acted on the purchase of the property, on the preparation 
  of the offering memorandum and on the resale of some of the units, including 
  the unit purchased by Dr. Shelson. The action sought damages against Gowlings 
  for breach of contract, negligence, negligent misrepresentation and breach of 
  fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>
  [5] Dr. Shelson made an assignment in bankruptcy in November 1996. Before he 
  did so, he met with Mr. Edward White, an officer of the trustee. Part of the 
  discussion between them related to the pending civil action. There is some controversy, 
  with which I deal below, about the content and the purport of their discussion.</p>
<p>
  [6] Dr. Shelson's application for discharge from bankruptcy, which was not opposed 
  by any of his creditors, was granted in August 1997. The trustee received its 
  discharge in January 1998. </p>
<p>
  [7] There is no evidence that the bankrupt's creditors gave the trustee any 
  instructions about the action during the period of Dr. Shelson's bankruptcy, 
  and the trustee did nothing about the action at the time it applied for its 
  discharge. Dr. Shelson continued to pursue the action for some five years until, 
  in April 2002, during an attendance before Wilson J., his status to pursue the 
  action was raised for the first time. Wilson J. ordered him to disclose all 
  relevant documents with respect to his bankruptcy and his status, and directed 
  that a copy of her order be served upon the trustee. When the trustee was advised, 
  it solicited tenders for the sale of its interest in the cause of action. Two 
  offers were received: one by Stephen Shefsky, a friend of Dr. Shelson, and a 
  second by Gowlings. The trustee purported to accept Gowlings' offer, subject 
  to court approval. </p>
<p>
  [8] The result was the motion by the bankrupt and the cross-motion by the trustee 
  referred to in para. [2].</p>
<p>
  [9] Three affidavits were before the court on the return of the motion and cross-motion. 
  The first, in point of time, was that of the bankrupt. The second, sworn some 
  five weeks later, was that of Mr. White, as an officer of the trustee. The third, 
  sworn shortly after that of Mr. White, was that of Mr. Shefsky. None of the 
  deponents was cross-examined on his affidavit. </p>
<p>
  [10] At no stage in this litigation has there been any question about Gowlings' 
  entitlement to tender for the assignment of the trustee's interest in an action 
  in which Gowlings was a defendant.</p>
<p>
  The decision of the Deputy Registrar [2002] O.J. No. 5062</p>
<p>
  [11] There was considerable dispute between the parties about the meaning of 
  the evidence of the bankrupt's conversation with Mr. White prior to the filing 
  of the assignment. It is useful to reproduce the paragraphs in the bankrupt's 
  affidavit that relate to this conversation. He said, at paras. 4, 5 and 6: </p>
<p class="indent"> 4. One of my assets listed on [my Personal Data form] was a 
  civil litigation claim described in an action between myself and others as plaintiffs 
  and Jeffrey Dennis and others as defendants. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">5. I was concerned about the status of the Action and what would 
  happen to the rights I had there under (the "Property") and in particular, whether 
  or not I would be entitled to continue with the Action after I filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="indent">6. Mr White advised me that the right to the Property would 
  vest in the Trustee. I however clearly understood from my discussion with Mr. 
  White that the trustee believed the Property was of little value to the estate 
  and that he was not interested in the Property and as long as the creditors 
  did not during the period of my bankruptcy instruct Mr. White to the contrary 
  I would be entitled to the Property after my discharge.</p>
<p>[12] The Deputy Registrar said the following about this evidence: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Bankrupt maintains in his affidavit that it was always his understanding 
  from his discussions with the Trustee prior to making the assignment, that, 
  so long as there were no contrary instructions from his creditors, the rights 
  to the Action would be returned to him after his discharge from bankruptcy. 
  The Bankrupt states that he clearly understood that, during bankruptcy, title 
  to the Action would vest in the Trustee, and accepted this, subject to his understanding 
  as to what would occur on discharge. That he had these discussions with Mr. 
  White of the Trustee is not controverted by the Trustee. In fact, the Trustee's 
  evidence in this matter is absolutely silent on the point. I accept the Bankrupt's 
  evidence, and draw the inference that it was his discussions with the Trustee 
  which led him to those beliefs [emphasis added].</p>
<p>[13] The Deputy Registrar framed the question before him to be whether the 
  court should order the action to be returned to the bankrupt. The answer, he 
  found, was "overwhelmingly in the affirmative". He accepted both of 
  the grounds advanced on Dr. Shelson's behalf: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) the first, based on the decision in Zemlak v. Deloitte, 
  Haskins &amp; Sells Limited (1987), 66 C.B.R. (N.S.) 1 (Sask. C.A.), that the 
  trustee was obliged either to return the non-realizable property under what 
  is now s. 40(1)<a href="#bottom">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> of the Bankruptcy and 
  Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 ("the BIA") or to carry on with the administration 
  of the estate and not seek its discharge. As the trustee had sought its discharge 
  without realizing upon its interest in the action, the trustee must have determined 
  that interest to be incapable of realization and remained its legal owner only 
  as trustee for the bankrupt; and</p>
<p class="indent">(2) the second, based on the rule in Re Condon, ex parte James 
  (1874), 9 Ch. App. 609, which he described as "an equitable rule which may be 
  invoked to prevent a trustee from relying upon its strict legal rights to the 
  inequitable detriment of a bankrupt or others."</p>
<p>
  The decision of Ground J.: (2003), 39 C.B.R. (4th) 292</p>
<p>
  [14] Ground J. found both of the bases of the Deputy Registrar's decision to 
  constitute errors in law.</p>
<p>
  [15] With respect to the first, he distinguished Zemlak as a case in which the 
  trustee was held to be disentitled from maintaining a caveat against real property 
  in which the bankrupt had no non-exempt equity in order that, when the property 
  eventually appreciated in value, it could be realized for the benefit of the 
  creditors. Regarding the present case, Ground J. said, at para. 6 of his reasons: </p>
<p class="indent"> [T]here is no evidence that the Trustee had, at any time, made 
  a determination that the interest of the Bankrupt in the Action had no realizable 
  value. The most that the Trustee did was to indicate to the Bankrupt that it 
  did not feel that the interest of the Bankrupt in the Action was of sufficient 
  value that it justified the estate continuing to prosecute the Action and that, 
  unless the creditors directed the Trustee to do otherwise, the Bankrupt would 
  be entitled to have the interest in the Action reconveyed to him on his discharge. 
  This would require a motion to be brought by the Bankrupt pursuant to subsection 
  40(2)<a href="#bottom">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> of the BIA to require the Trustee 
  to transfer the interest of the estate in the Action to him. </p>
<p>
  [16] With respect to the second, he held that the rule in Ex parte James was 
  inapplicable because the estate was not being enriched to the detriment of a 
  third party in circumstances where there was unusual hardship to a third party 
  or manifest injustice in permitting the trustee to rely on its strict legal 
  rights. He observed that the only person detrimentally affected by the trustee's 
  decision was the bankrupt and that he knew of no precedent for applying the 
  rule in Ex parte James where the person challenging the right of the trustee 
  to rely upon its strict legal rights was the bankrupt himself.</p>
<p>
  [17] Ground J. authorized the trustee to accept Gowlings' offer to purchase 
  the estate's interest in the action for the sum of $20,000.</p>
<p>
  "property of a bankrupt found incapable of realization"</p>
<p>
  [18] In the disposition of this appeal, I find it necessary to deal with only 
  the first issue considered by the Deputy Registrar and by Ground J.: whether, 
  in applying for its discharge, the trustee found, or was deemed to have found, 
  the bankrupt's interest in the action to be incapable of realization and that, 
  having so found, he was obliged to return that asset to the bankrupt under s. 
  40(1) of the BIA. As appears in footnote 1, above, that section provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> 40.(1) With the permission of the inspectors<a href="#bottom">[3]</a><a name="3"></a>, 
  any property of a bankrupt found incapable of realization shall be returned 
  to the bankrupt prior to the trustee's application for discharge. </p>
<p>
  [19] It will be recalled that the Deputy Registrar accepted the evidence of 
  the bankrupt set out in paras. 4-6 of his affidavit and drew the inference that 
  it was his discussions with the trustee that led the bankrupt to hold the beliefs 
  to which he deposed in those paragraphs. On the appeal, Gowlings' counsel took 
  issue with the inference drawn by the Deputy Registrar, and carefully parsed 
  the language appearing in para. 6 of the bankrupt's affidavit. In his submission, 
  while the first sentence of para. 6 deposed to a fact, the balance of the paragraph 
  (beginning with the words "I clearly understood") did not. He downplayed 
  the trustee's failure to respond, suggesting that the balance of the paragraph 
  lacked evidentiary value and did not merit a response. </p>
<p>
  [20] I do not agree. In my view, it was open to the Deputy Registrar to draw, 
  from paras. 4-6 of the bankrupt's affidavit and from the trustee's failure to 
  respond to those paragraphs, the inference that the bankrupt's conversation 
  with Mr. White led Dr. Shelson to believe that, on his discharge, the interest 
  in the action which passed to the trustee in bankruptcy would revest in him. 
  Such a finding, whether described as a finding of fact or an inference of fact, 
  is entitled to deference and will not be overturned in the absence of a palpable 
  and overriding error: Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at paras. 10 
  and 19. This deference is paid whether the evidence in the first instance is 
  given in the form of oral testimony or on written material by way of affidavit: 
  Equity Waste Management of Canada v. Halton Hills (Town) (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 
  321 (C.A.) at 336; Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada 
  (Attorney General) (2002), 57 O.R. (3d) 511 (C.A.) at para. 11. </p>
<p>
  [21] Everything the bankrupt did subsequent to his discharge, together with 
  the trustee's prolonged disinterest in the action, is consistent with and supports 
  the Deputy Registrar's finding. I therefore proceed on the basis found by the 
  Deputy Registrar with respect to paras. 4 to 6 of the bankrupt's affidavit. 
  </p>
<p>
  [22] However, that finding is not conclusive of this appeal. Even if, putting 
  it at its highest, there was an agreement by the trustee that the interest in 
  the action would be returned to the bankrupt after his discharge, such an agreement 
  would not prevail if it ran contrary to the interests of the creditors of the 
  estate.</p>
<p>
  [23] I therefore proceed to the first of the two bases of the Deputy Registrar's 
  decision. Relying on the decision in Zemlak v. Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells 
  Limited (1987), 66 C.B.R. (N.S.) 1 (Sask. C.A.), he said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Court in Zemlak concluded on the facts that the trustee was obliged to either 
  return the non-realisable property under what is now s. 40(1) of the Act, or 
  carry on with administration of the estate, and not seek its discharge. I adopt 
  this reasoning. The Trustee must make a decision when it applies for its discharge. 
  On the facts at bar, the Trustee's actions speak loudly that it considered the 
  Action incapable of realisation in that it applied for its discharge, and did 
  nothing in relation to the Action until this year.</p>
<p>
  [24] In Zemlak, the trustee sought to maintain a caveat against the bankrupt's 
  residential property in which, at the time that both the bankrupt and the trustee 
  were discharged, the bankrupt had little or no non-exempt equity. The object 
  of maintaining the caveat was to wait until non-exempt equity built up in the 
  property that would form a realizable fund for creditors at some future date. 
  The judge of first instance granted an order permitting the discharged trustee 
  to continue the caveat. The bankrupt appealed to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. 
  That court allowed the appeal, holding that the maintenance of the caveat was 
  not in accordance with the philosophy of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. 
  B-3. In doing so, the Court said, at p. 11: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the circumstances of this case, we have concluded that the trustee was obliged 
  to either return the real property under s. 22(1) [now s. 40(1)] and be discharged 
  or alternatively established that there was a non-exempt equity in the home 
  and then continue with the administration of the estate until completion. Since 
  neither of these requirements have been met, the caveat must be vacated and 
  we so order.</p>
<p>
  [25] In reaching that conclusion, Zemlak relied upon the earlier decision of 
  the Quebec Court of Appeal in Thompson v. Coulombe (1984), 54 C.B.R. (N.S.) 
  254. Thompson involved a discharged bankrupt who brought an action to set aside 
  a sale of shares that took place prior to his bankruptcy. The action was brought 
  after the discharge of both the bankrupt and the trustee. The action was met 
  by an exception to dismiss on the basis that the plaintiff had no interest in 
  the action because he was a discharged bankrupt and because he had not obtained 
  an assignment of the trustee's rights. Following service of the exception to 
  dismiss, but before it was heard, the plaintiff obtained from the trustee a 
  reassignment of all of the rights claimed in the action. The Court of Appeal 
  reversed an order dismissing the action. It held that the ground raised in the 
  exception to dismiss did not involve a fundamental lack of interest in the object 
  of the action but rather an irregularity resulting from a lack of capacity to 
  bring action prior to obtaining a reassignment from the trustee or a court order. 
  In language that was specifically adopted in Zemlak, Rothman J.A. said, at para. 
  12: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Under s.[40(1)] of the Act, the trustee had an obligation, prior to applying 
  for his discharge, to return to appellant any property which he found incapable 
  of realization. These claims, by their nature, would obviously have been difficult 
  of realization and they were not exercised prior to his discharge. Although 
  the trustee did not reassign them prior to his discharge, he did, in fact, reassign 
  them to appellant prior to the hearing of the exception. Had the trustee not 
  done so, appellant could have applied for a court order under s.[40(2)].</p>
<p>
  [26] Both Thompson and Zemlak, in turn, were cited in the decision of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in Royal Bank of Canada v. North American Life Assurance Co. 
  (1996), 37 C.B.R. (3d) 141. In that case, the bankrupt had, within five years 
  prior to his bankruptcy, transferred registered retirement savings plan funds 
  (which were not exempt from the claims of creditors) into a registered retirement 
  income fund, or RRIF (which under provincial law was exempt from the claims 
  of creditors) and designated his wife as beneficiary of the RRIF. The trustee 
  in bankruptcy, who had not been discharged, sought to set aside the transfer 
  as a settlement under the BIA. His application was dismissed by the chambers 
  judge. One of the creditors pursued an appeal, which was dismissed by the Saskatchewan 
  Court of Appeal. The creditor appealed, again unsuccessfully, to the Supreme 
  Court of Canada. The judgment of the court was delivered by Gonthier J. In holding 
  that the RRIF was an exempt asset unavailable to creditors of the bankrupt, 
  he said, at para. 52: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Therefore, even though [the bankrupt] effected a void settlement under the second 
  branch of s. 91(2) when he designated his wife as beneficiary of his RRIF, that 
  does not allow the trustee to use the funds in the RRIF to satisfy the claims 
  of creditors such as the appellant bank. The RRIF is an exempt asset pursuant 
  to the provincial legislation incorporated into s. 67(1)(b), meaning that it 
  is not property which is divisible among creditors. Given this, even though 
  [the bankrupt's wife's] future contingent interest in the RRIF had passed into 
  the possession of the trustee through the application of s. 91(2), the RRIF 
  was property "incapable of realization" by the trustee pursuant to 
  s. 40(1) BIA. Therefore, the trustee was obliged to return it to [the bankrupt] 
  prior to applying for his discharge: Thompson v. Coulombe (1984), 54 C.B.R. 
  (N.S.) 254 (Que.C.A.) at p. 257; Zemlak (Trustee of) v. Zemlak (1987), 66 C.B.R. 
  (N.S.) 1 (Sask. C.A.), at pp. 9 and 11.</p>
<p>
  [27] Of the three cases - Thompson, Zemlak and Royal Bank - only Zemlak is factually 
  similar to the case at bar. Thompson involved a discharged bankrupt and a discharged 
  trustee who, before the hearing of a motion to dismiss the bankrupt's action, 
  provided him with the necessary assignment of his action. Royal Bank involved 
  a bankrupt who had been discharged, who was being pursued by a creditor to set 
  aside a settlement under the BIA and whose trustee had not yet applied for his 
  discharge.</p>
<p>
  [28] Zemlak, on the other hand, involved a discharged bankrupt and a discharged 
  trustee who sought to tie up the bankrupt's property indefinitely in the hope 
  that it would enhance in value and turn what was an exempt equity in the property 
  into a non-exempt equity. </p>
<p>
  [29] I do not quarrel with the result in Zemlak or with the Deputy Registrar's 
  reliance on that case. But, with deference, I am concerned with the breadth 
  of the proposition stated by the Deputy Registrar: that when a trustee applies 
  for its discharge, it must elect, or be considered to have elected, to return 
  to the bankrupt its interest in non-realizable property under s. 40(1) of the 
  BIA and, if it fails to do so, it holds that interest as trustee for the bankrupt 
  and must return that interest to him.</p>
<p> [30] In my view, the proposition cannot be framed as a "bright-line" rule 
  that admits of no exceptions. Even the court in Zemlak qualified its statement 
  of the proposition by the introductory phrase "[I]n the circumstances of this 
  case": see para. 24, above. This court distinguished Zemlak and permitted a 
  trustee in bankruptcy, following his discharge and that of the bankrupts, to 
  take proceedings to pursue two properties, the values of which had been misrepresented 
  by the bankrupts in their statements of affairs: Rocher v. H. &amp; M. Diamond 
  &amp; Associates (2003), 43 C.B.R. (4th) 134. Even in instances short of misrepresentation 
  or other misconduct by the bankrupt, it is not difficult to think of examples 
  where an exception to the proposition would be appropriate. One is where an 
  asset previously unknown to the trustee is discovered within a reasonable time 
  of his application for discharge. Another is where the trustee learns within 
  a reasonable time of his application for discharge that an asset previously 
  considered to be unrealizable in fact had realizable value. In both examples, 
  assuming that the asset is one which should, in the interests of the creditors 
  of the estate, be realized, the court must retain some discretion to decide 
  whether the proposition does or does not apply<a href="#bottom">[4]</a><a name="4"></a>. 
  Failure to imbue the rule with some measure of flexibility renders a trustee's 
  application for discharge a trap for the unwary. </p>
<p>
  [31] However, even crediting the proposition with some measure of flexibility, 
  I am of the view that it does apply in the factual context of the present case. 
  The trustee incontrovertibly had knowledge of the existence of the action before 
  Dr. Shelson made his assignment in bankruptcy. It took no steps with respect 
  to the action during the fourteen months between its appointment and its discharge. 
  It took no steps for more than four and a half years after its discharge, during 
  which Dr. Shelson continued to pursue the action. It was ultimately moved to 
  assert its claim to an interest in the action only after a judge who queried 
  Dr. Shelson's status directed that notice be given to it. In my view, it was 
  by then far too late for the trustee to come forward and seek to realize on 
  the value of its professed interest in the action. </p>
<p>
  [32] In the result, I agree with the Deputy Registrar that the trustee should 
  be ordered to assign its interest in the action to the bankrupt.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [33] I would allow the appeal, set aside paras. 1 and 2 of the order of Ground 
  J., and order that the trustee assign to the bankrupt all of its right, title 
  and interest in the action. By para. 3, Ground J. ordered that there be no costs 
  to or against any party of the proceedings before the Deputy Registrar or before 
  him, and I would not disturb that part of his order. I would award the appellant 
  his costs of this appeal which, having regard to the submissions made by counsel 
  at the conclusion of the argument, I would fix in the amount of $7,500 plus 
  disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
