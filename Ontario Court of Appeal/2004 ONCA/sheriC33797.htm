<p>On appeal from the conviction for manslaughter entered by Justice Eugene Ewaschuk 
  of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on December 10, 1999.	
  </p>
<p>
  SIMMONS J.A. and LANGDON J. (ad hoc): </p>
<p>
  I. Overview</p>
<p>
  [1] Early in the morning of March 9, 1997, the appellant placed two telephone 
  calls to 911 from his neighbours' apartment. He placed the calls approximately 
  four minutes apart. In the first call, he requested the police, saying that 
  a friend had assaulted him and had broken his nose. In the second call, the 
  appellant asked for an ambulance, saying that he hit his friend with a knife 
  and that his friend could die. </p>
<p>
  [2] Upon entering the appellant's apartment, the police found Aamer Khan lying 
  face-up, just inside the door, and a knife on the floor beside him. Mr. Khan 
  had no vital signs and was later pronounced dead at the hospital.</p>
<p>
  [3] Mr. Khan had been stabbed seven times, once in the chest, once in the left 
  side, and five times in the back. Subsequent testing revealed that there was 
  no blood on the knife found close to his body. The police found a second knife 
  on the balcony of the neighbours' apartment, after the appellant directed them 
  to that location. </p>
<p>
  [4] The appellant was charged with second-degree murder and tried before Ewaschuk 
  J., sitting with a jury. </p>
<p>
  [5] At trial, the Crown alleged that the two friends had an argument that escalated 
  into a fight and that during the course of the fight the appellant went into 
  the kitchen and grabbed a knife. Based on the nature and location of Mr. Khan's 
  injuries, the pattern of bloodstains in the apartment, and the location of Mr. 
  Khan's body, the Crown asserted that the appellant initially stabbed Mr. Khan 
  in the chest, and then, as Mr. Khan attempted to flee through the front door, 
  stabbed him repeatedly in the back. The Crown also alleged that the appellant 
  fled the scene via his balcony, and that, as he did so, he brushed his knife 
  against the balcony door, depositing a bloodstain. Finally, the Crown asserted 
  that, prior to the arrival of the police, the appellant and his father returned 
  to the appellant's apartment and planted the knife that was found beside Mr. 
  Khan's body. </p>
<p>
  [6] The defence position was that the appellant should be acquitted because 
  he acted in self-defence. The appellant testified at trial and admitted that 
  he stabbed Mr. Khan. However, he said that Mr. Khan behaved abnormally during 
  a visit that began on March 8, 1997. When the appellant asked Mr. Khan to leave 
  at around 4 a.m. on March 9, 1997, Mr. Khan resisted and challenged the appellant 
  to a fight. During the course of the ensuing struggle, Mr. Khan attempted to 
  choke the appellant, but the appellant broke free and grabbed two knives for 
  protection. The appellant subsequently dropped one of the knives while trying 
  to get out his front door; he used the other knife to stab Mr. Khan in self-defence 
  during the course of a close quarters face-to-face struggle. </p>
<p>
  [7] The defence called a co-worker and three friends of Mr. Khan who gave evidence 
  about changes in Mr. Khan's behaviour in the months leading up to his death. 
  A psychiatrist opined that Mr. Khan's behaviour indicated some form of emotional 
  disturbance that developed into a psychotic breakdown on the night in question. 
  Five defence witnesses testified concerning the appellant's reputation in the 
  community as an honest and peaceful person.</p>
<p>
  [8] The Crown called reply evidence to rebut the defence claims of emotional 
  disturbance and psychotic breakdown. </p>
<p>
  [9] In addition to self-defence, the trial judge instructed the jury concerning 
  the specific intent required for second-degree murder and concerning the partial 
  defence of provocation, therefore leaving it open to the jury to convict the 
  appellant of manslaughter only. The jury found the appellant not guilty of second-degree 
  murder, but guilty of the included offence of manslaughter. On March 6, 2000, 
  the trial judge sentenced the appellant to three years in jail in addition to 
  15 months of pre-sentence custody.</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant raises ten issues on his appeal against conviction. The first 
  nine issues are stand-alone grounds of appeal. The tenth issue is a cumulative 
  ground, which the appellant claims justifies a new trial in combination with 
  the preceding grounds: </p>
<p class="indent"> i. the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to assert 
  a speculative theory, namely that the appellant participated in planting the 
  knife found at Mr. Khan's side; </p>
<p class="indent">ii. the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury on 
  self-defence;</p>
<p class="indent">iii. the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury on 
  reasonable doubt;</p>
<p class="indent">iv. the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury on 
  motive;</p>
<p class="indent">v. the trial judge erred in admitting hearsay evidence of a 
  statement allegedly made by Mr. Khan on the morning before his death;</p>
<p class="indent">vi. when a friend of the appellant (Mubin Shaikh) was unable 
  to recall whether the appellant told him that Mr. Khan tried to choke him, the 
  trial judge erred in refusing to admit another witness's evidence (Ismail Ibrahim) 
  that Mr. Shaikh told Mr. Ibrahim that the appellant did say that;</p>
<p class="indent">vii. the trial judge erred in refusing to permit the defence 
  to re-address the jury after Crown counsel changed his theory, in his closing 
  address, concerning how a bloodstain was deposited on the balcony door; </p>
<p class="indent">viii. the trial judge erred by failing to warn the jury sufficiently 
  concerning inflammatory submissions made by the Crown;</p>
<p class="indent">ix. the trial judge's conduct raises a reasonable apprehension 
  that the appellant did not receive a fair trial; and</p>
<p class="indent">x. Crown counsel's conduct was inflammatory and inconsistent 
  with the Crown's quasi-judicial role. </p>
<p>
  [11] For the reasons that follow, we would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  II. Background</p>
<p>
  a) The Crown's case</p>
<p>
  i) the appellant awakens the neighbours on March 9, 1997</p>
<p>
  [12] Three occupants of apartment 1107, 79 Thorncliffe Park Drive, Toronto testified 
  that they were awakened by the sound of someone trying to get in their balcony 
  door between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. on Sunday, March 9, 1997. One of the occupants 
  described hearing a voice on the balcony saying, "help me, help me, help 
  me". She said that she recognized the appellant after he entered the apartment 
  and that he was crying and saying something she could not understand. The second 
  and third occupants described the appellant as crying and appearing very scared. 
  Although the appellant was asking for the police, the female occupant called 
  the appellant's father, who arrived at apartment 1107 about fifteen to twenty 
  minutes later.</p>
<p>
  ii) the 911 calls</p>
<p>
  [13] After arriving at the neighbours' apartment, the appellant's father called 
  911. He asked for the police, saying that someone had hit his son. The 911operator 
  spoke to the appellant and asked if he had been assaulted. The appellant responded, 
  "I was-um in that way-ah-yeah, I could of ". </p>
<p>
  [14] The appellant then explained to the operator that his best friend was visiting, 
  that he asked his friend to leave at 4 a.m., and that his friend refused, punched 
  him and broke his nose. The appellant declined the offer of an ambulance and 
  did not mention that he had stabbed Mr. Khan. The first 911call ended at 4:17:05 
  a.m.</p>
<p>
  [15] Three minutes and fifty-three seconds later, the appellant made a second 
  call to 911 from apartment 1107 saying, "[w]e need an ambulance, 'cause 
  he's about-he could die". When asked what had happened the appellant said, 
  "[w]e got into a fight&#133;and it was over a knife. Right? He was about 
  to kill me. He was gonna actually kill me". The appellant said that his 
  friend was injured, and that he "hit" his friend with a knife. When 
  asked if he had stabbed his friend, the appellant answered, "[y]es". 
  The operator asked if his friend was conscious. The appellant answered, "[w]ell, 
  I ran out&#133;he was chasing me, while I ran away. He was&#133;throwing things 
  at me. And I ran&#133;out on the balcony".</p>
<p>
  [16] The second 911 call ended at 4:24 a.m. The female occupant of apartment 
  1107 testified that, sometime after the 911 calls were made, the appellant and 
  his father left the neighbours' apartment.</p>
<p>
  iii) the arrival of the police and the appellant's arrest</p>
<p>
  [17] The police arrived at 79 Thorncliffe Park Drive at 4:36 a.m. They emerged 
  from the elevator on the eleventh floor to find the appellant and his father 
  standing in the hallway. The appellant said, "I called you because I stabbed 
  my friend". One of the officers noted that the appellant had blood smeared 
  around his mouth.</p>
<p>
  [18] Upon entering the appellant's apartment (apartment 1111), the police found 
  Mr. Khan lying face-up on the floor with his head three to four feet inside 
  the threshold of the doorway and a knife on the floor beside him, to his left. 
  The apartment was in a state of some disarray, consistent with a struggle. Subsequent 
  testing revealed that there was no blood on the knife found beside Mr. Khan's 
  body. After being directed to the balcony of apartment 1107 by the appellant, 
  the police located the knife used to stab Mr. Khan under a patio chair. </p>
<p>
  [19] The appellant was arrested and taken to the police station. He did not 
  complain of any injury. However, photographs of the appellant taken soon after 
  his arrest disclose superficial cuts or scratches to his hands, red marks on 
  the left side of his face, and swelling over one eyebrow.</p>
<p>
  iv) Mubin Shaikh's evidence concerning a conversation with the appellant about 
  the events in issue</p>
<p>
  [20] Mubin Shaikh met the appellant and Mr. Khan in 1995, while all three men 
  were on a religious trip to India and Pakistan. Mr. Shaikh testified that he 
  received a collect telephone call from the appellant while the appellant was 
  in custody awaiting trial. In response to Mr. Shaikh's inquiry about what happened, 
  the appellant told Mr. Shaikh that Mr. Khan said something about staying over 
  at his apartment that night and that he (the appellant) told Mr. Khan that would 
  not be appropriate. </p>
<p>
  [21] The appellant also told Mr. Shaikh that Mr. Khan played a Metallica song 
  entitled "Enter Sandman" and, in referring specifically to a verse 
  about demons, said, "See, they come at night." Mr. Khan then asked 
  the appellant to speak to him in a female voice.</p>
<p>
  [22] Mr. Shaikh testified that the appellant told him that the fight started 
  when the appellant asked Mr. Khan to leave. Mr. Khan got up and punched the 
  appellant in the face and knocked him down. A struggle ensued, things were thrown 
  around, Mr. Khan was on top of the appellant, a knife was involved, and the 
  appellant stabbed Mr. Khan. Mr. Khan kept coming at the appellant, despite being 
  stabbed. In his examination in-chief, Mr. Shaikh said that the appellant told 
  him that he continued to stab Mr. Khan until Mr. Khan stopped coming at him 
  and fell, and that the appellant ran to his balcony with Mr. Khan still chasing 
  him. In cross-examination, Mr. Shaikh said he was not sure whether the appellant 
  told him that Mr. Khan fell. </p>
<p>
  [23] In addition, defence counsel made the following suggestion to Mr. Shaikh 
  during cross-examination: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If I were to suggest to you that you told Ismail Ibrahim that [the appellant] 
  told you that Mr. Khan was choking him and could not get him off would [you] 
  agree it's possible, maybe that's something was said to you and you just can't 
  remember it now?</p>
<p>
  [24] Mr. Shaikh agreed that it was possible. Defence counsel subsequently asked, 
  "[y]ou don't have a recollection either way?" Mr. Shaikh responded, 
  "I can't say with absolute certainty that I remember saying it".</p>
<p>
  [25] The trial judge later refused to permit defence counsel to lead evidence 
  from Mr. Ibrahim during the defence case that Mr. Shaikh told Mr. Ibrahim that 
  the appellant said that Mr. Khan choked him (the appellant) during the course 
  of the struggle.</p>
<p>
  v) Mubin Shaikh's testimony about the deceased's behaviour</p>
<p>
  [26] Mr. Shaikh testified that, after the 1995 trip, he noticed a change in 
  Mr. Khan's behaviour. He said that Mr. Khan appeared more detached and that 
  he was always talking about "Jinns", or spirits. Evil Jinns are called 
  Shaytan, (a variation of Satan). Mr. Shaikh recalled an evening when Mr. Khan 
  broke off in the middle of a conversation and said, "Shaytan is here." 
  Mr. Shaikh also said that all three men were religious and that, after the trip, 
  he never saw Mr. Khan without a beard until seeing him clean shaven at his funeral. 
  </p>
<p>
  [27] After the appellant was arrested, Mr. Shaikh went to appellant's apartment 
  to help the appellant's wife move their belongings. He found a Metallica tape 
  still in the machine and took it home. When he played it, he found that it had 
  been stopped near the end of the first song, "Enter Sandman."</p>
<p>
  vi) the pathologist's testimony</p>
<p>
  [28] Mr. Khan sustained seven stab wounds ranging in depth from 3.5 cms. to 
  15.5 cms. The pathologist testified that once a knife penetrates the skin, very 
  little force is required to cause the knife to penetrate farther into the body. 
  None of Mr. Khan's wounds was as deep as the length of the knife said to have 
  caused them. The wounds to the back of his neck (8.5 cms. deep, from back to 
  front, downward and slightly right to left) and to the area of the left scapula 
  (15.5 cms. deep, back to front, left to right and downwards), both of which 
  penetrated the left lung, were the most significant.</p>
<p>
  [29] The pathologist could not give an opinion concerning the order in which 
  the wounds were inflicted. However, he said that, after sustaining his wounds, 
  Mr. Khan could have survived for up to 45 minutes but could not have continued 
  vigorous activity for more than a couple of minutes. </p>
<p>
  [30] The pathologist noted that Mr. Khan also sustained five wounds to his hands, 
  which appeared consistent with Mr. Khan grabbing the blade of the knife. Although 
  he described these injuries as more likely defensive rather than offensive, 
  the pathologist agreed that they could only be characterized as defensive if 
  the intent of the person grabbing the knife was defensive. In addition, Mr. 
  Khan sustained several relatively minor blunt force injuries consistent with 
  a struggle or scuffle.</p>
<p>
  [31] While indicating that his findings were consistent with a fight in which 
  a single stab wound was administered to the chest after which the deceased turned 
  and was stabbed six times from the rear, the pathologist agreed that there were 
  also other possible scenarios that would be consistent with his findings. In 
  particular, he agreed that his findings were consistent with a struggle in which 
  the individuals were close together and grabbing each other, and the knife was 
  going in at angles. However, the angled wounds suffered by Mr. Khan did not 
  necessarily mean the individuals were close together when those wounds were 
  inflicted and the pathologist was not able to make any definitive statement 
  about the degree of separation between the two men when the angled wounds occurred. 
  </p>
<p>
  [32] Based purely on his autopsy findings, the pathologist said he could not 
  "strongly pick" any one of the scenarios over another.</p>
<p>
  [33] T.H.C. was detected in Mr. Khan's chest blood in a concentration that suggested 
  cannabis use within 6 hours of his death.</p>
<p>
  vii) the Crown biologist's testimony </p>
<p>
  [34] Mr. Khan's blood was found on the kitchen floor, on the kitchen counter, 
  on the patio door leading to the balcony, on the living room carpet close to 
  the front hallway, on the living room wall, on the front hall closet and closet 
  frame, on the inside of the front door just below the locking mechanism, on 
  the front hall intercom panel, on the front hall wall and on the front hall 
  floor.</p>
<p>
  [35] The Crown biologist testified that the majority of Mr. Khan's bleeding 
  occurred near the front door of the apartment while Mr. Khan was either standing 
  or partly upright. However, that did not mean that his injuries were sustained 
  in that location. Mr. Khan was wearing four layers of clothes and it would take 
  time for the blood from the stab wounds to penetrate the layers of clothing. 
  The blood from the cuts to his hands would have been exposed much sooner. </p>
<p>
  [36] Initially, the Crown biologist said that he could not exclude the possibility 
  that the bloodstain found on the patio door had been transferred from the blade 
  of a knife. However, following the testimony of a defence bloodstain pattern 
  analyst, the appellant filed a supplementary report from the Crown biologist 
  stating that, based on additional experiments he had conducted, he could "find 
  no support for the knife [found at] apartment 1107 having made the swipe stain 
  on the balcony door of apartment 1111". </p>
<p>
  [37] Mr. Khan's blood was also found on the appellant's shirt. The appellant's 
  blood was found on his jacket, his jeans, as well as on the floor and on a table 
  in apartment 1107. </p>
<p>
  b) The Defence Case</p>
<p>
  i) the appellant's testimony</p>
<p>
  [38] The appellant was 26 years old at the time of trial. He is married and 
  has two children. At the time of his arrest, he weighed 102 lbs. and was 5'5" 
  tall. At age 17 the appellant pleaded guilty to a minor credit card fraud and 
  received a conditional discharge. </p>
<p>
  [39] The appellant and Mr. Khan are Muslims. After their return from the religious 
  trip in 1995 on which they met, Mr. Khan began to change and to speak deeply 
  about religion and his contact with Jinns. When the appellant's daughter was 
  born, Mr. Khan gave her a book about Jinns, a gift the appellant thought inappropriate. 
  Prior to March 8, 1997, Mr. Khan's changes had not caused the appellant to fear 
  him. Mr. Khan was slightly taller than the appellant, and weighed about 135 
  lbs.</p>
<p>
  [40] On the evening of March 8, 1997, the appellant invited Mr. Khan to his 
  apartment. He noticed that Mr. Khan was clean-shaven when he arrived. They left 
  the appellant's apartment at 10:30 p.m. and returned at midnight with some marihuana. 
  Mr. Khan rolled a marihuana joint and said to the appellant, "Listen, do 
  you hear? They're here. Shaytan is here." An hour later Mr. Khan spoke 
  again of Jinns and insisted on playing the Metallica song, "Enter Sandman". 
  Mr. Khan insisted that the appellant listen to the verse containing the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Now I lay me down to sleep, pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I die before I 
  wake pray the Lord my soul to take. Hush little baby don't say a word and never 
  mind that noise, that noise you heard. It's just the beast under your bed, in 
  your closet, in your head.</p>
<p>
  [41] The appellant became uncomfortable and turned off the music. Mr. Khan then 
  asked the appellant to describe female genitalia while speaking in a female 
  voice. The appellant changed the subject. He asked when Mr. Khan planned to 
  leave. Mr. Khan responded, "In fifteen or twenty minutes," but he 
  did not leave. The appellant waited and then, once again, asked Mr. Khan to 
  leave. Ten minutes later the appellant got up, put on his boots and coat and 
  went to wait for Mr. Khan by the elevator. Mr. Khan did not leave the appellant's 
  apartment. The appellant returned to his apartment and the two men had a confrontation 
  over Mr. Khan's refusal to leave. </p>
<p>
  [42] The appellant took Mr. Khan's arm to pull him up off the couch and Mr. 
  Khan promised once again to leave. The appellant took Mr. Khan's arm again. 
  Mr. Khan stood up, adopted a boxer's stance and said, "What you want to 
  fight me?" The two men lunged at each other. The appellant described what 
  happened next as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> A. It was my reflex and I think - I don't know if I was trying 
  to block him or I hit him. I know I hit him in the face at that time. ...</p>
<p class="indent">Q. You demonstrated him having his hands in a fight stance and 
  you demonstrated a forward motion?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes. And right after that punch hit me, I don't know exactly 
  where on my lips or nose right over here.</p>
<p>The appellant said that the two men then grappled and fell to 
  the floor. Mr. Khan got on top of the appellant, squeezed his neck, and said, 
  "Do you want me to kill you?"</p>
<p>
  [43] The appellant got out from under Mr. Khan and tried to reach the phone. 
  Mr. Khan grabbed it from him. The appellant discovered blood on his mouth and 
  went to the kitchen to wash it off. Mr. Khan followed. The appellant grabbed 
  two knives from a block, intending to frighten Mr. Khan into compliance, and 
  ran with them to the front door. Mr. Khan followed. The appellant dropped one 
  knife so he could use his hand to unlock the door. He then heard a loud metallic 
  crash that paralyzed him. Mr. Khan grabbed him from behind. They fought for 
  control of the knife and Mr. Khan grabbed the knife blade. </p>
<p>
  [44] The appellant said he remembered "poking" Mr. Khan with the knife, 
  once in the back and once in the front but denied stabbing Mr. Khan from behind. 
  He said that he was facing Mr. Khan when he stabbed him, and that he feared 
  for his life. He wanted to get free of Mr. Khan and get away. He finally did 
  break free and ran directly to the balcony. He saw Mr. Khan chasing him. He 
  clambered from the balcony of apartment 1111 to that of 1107. He thought he 
  might have thrown the knife on to the balcony of apartment 1107. He asked the 
  occupants of apartment 1107 to call the police but they called his father instead. 
  </p>
<p>
  [45] After arriving at the neighbours' apartment, the appellant's father called 
  911. At first, the appellant declined the offer of an ambulance because he believed 
  he had not seriously harmed Mr. Khan. However, after checking the appellant's 
  apartment, the appellant's father told the appellant to call an ambulance. The 
  appellant and his father left apartment 1107 and met the police at the elevator. 
  In cross-examination, the appellant specifically rejected the Crown's suggestion 
  that he went to his apartment between the 911 calls and planted the knife that 
  was found near Mr. Khan's body.</p>
<p>
  [46] The appellant's father died before the trial commenced. </p>
<p>
  ii) evidence concerning Mr. Khan.</p>
<p>
  [47] The appellant called three mutual friends who testified about Mr. Khan's 
  unusual behaviour in the months before his death. One of them, Richard Liao, 
  discussed Jinns with Mr. Khan and said Mr. Khan told him that something had 
  stepped on his head. Another, Adam Basilone, had invited Mr. Khan to his home. 
  While there Mr. Khan said, "This is an evil place. Shaytan is here." 
  Mr. Khan continued to speak like this for about half an hour until Mr. Basilone 
  asked Mr. Shaikh, who was also present, to take Mr. Khan home. </p>
<p>
  [48] Ismail Ibrahim knew Mr. Khan before and after his 1995 trip. He noted that, 
  following the trip, Mr. Khan had become more religious, more reserved and "weird". 
  He recalled Mr. Khan telling him on a bus that people were staring at him. </p>
<p>
  iii) psychiatric evidence.</p>
<p>
  [49] Dr. Robert Hill, a psychiatrist, gave evidence based on materials presented 
  to him about Mr. Khan, including some notes from Mr. Khan's family physician. 
  He opined that before March 9, 1997, Mr. Khan was suffering from some sort of 
  emotional disturbance and that he was becoming more severely mentally ill. He 
  said that if Mr. Khan's behaviour on the night in question was as described 
  by the appellant, it was in keeping with that of a quite severely mentally disturbed 
  individual. </p>
<p>
  iv) bloodstain evidence.</p>
<p>
  [50] The defence bloodstain pattern analyst opined that the bloodstain on the 
  balcony door was likely the result of a transfer from skin or cloth. He said 
  that a bloodstain on the left cuff of Mr. Khan's sweatshirt contained sufficient 
  blood to have made that stain while a bloodstain on the appellant's jacket did 
  not.</p>
<p>
  c) The Crown's Case in Reply.</p>
<p>
  i) why Mr. Khan shaved off his beard</p>
<p>
  [51] During the course of the trial, the defence presented evidence indicating 
  that it was quite unusual for a devout Muslim to shave his beard. From this 
  evidence the defence theorized that Mr. Khan's conduct, in shaving his beard 
  on the morning before he died, was a sign that he had succumbed to mental illness. 
  </p>
<p>
  [52] The trial judge permitted Mr. Khan's brother, Aatif Khan, to testify in 
  reply that, on the Friday before he died, Mr. Khan told their grandmother that 
  he shaved off his beard after cutting it accidentally.</p>
<p>
  ii) the Crown's psychiatrist</p>
<p>
  [53] The Crown also called Dr. Klassen, a psychiatrist, as a reply witness. 
  Dr. Klassen noted that the information available to him and Dr. Hill was less 
  than one would normally have in attempting a psychiatric diagnosis. He also 
  noted that cultural and religious components made diagnosis even more difficult. 
  </p>
<p>
  [54] Initially Dr. Klassen disagreed with Dr. Hill's opinion. He felt that Mr. 
  Khan was functioning better than was possible if he were an acutely psychotic 
  person. However, when asked about Mr. Khan's specific behaviour on the night 
  in question, as described by the appellant, Dr. Klassen said the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  What happened that night, &#133; given the facts as you've given it to me, the 
  possibilities include the following, which I won't necessarily list in order 
  of priority, but they include, he may have been having a manic episode, that 
  he may have been psychotic.</p>
<p>
  In response to a question concerning whether the manic episode would include 
  psychotic features, he continued: </p>
<p class="indent"> With or without psychotic symptoms &#133; We kind of went through 
  this overvalued ideation psychosis dichotomy so that's what I'm referring to. 
  Could be a psychotic episode with another underlying diagnosis such as schizophrenia 
  or it could be that he was psychotic as a result of street drugs or other psychogenic 
  drug intoxication. </p>
<p class="indent">It could be that there were some situational or environmental 
  factors that lead him to be highly agitated and outside of his normal frame 
  of reference in terms of his interpersonal presentation and level of activity 
  and those kinds of things. </p>
<p>
  [55] When asked whether he would still disagree with the proposition that Mr. 
  Khan was suffering from some sort of mental illness if one removed the assumption 
  that Mr. Khan was able to function at work, Dr. Klassen said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  My position is not that he was or wasn't. My main position is that there is 
  a lot of data missing and it's hard to be conclusive. I pick one piece of that 
  data [that] seems to be more important to me that being the work data, but I 
  would agree in the hypothetical scenario posed to me with those facts if you 
  add to [it that] this man['s] function[ing] was decreasing it would support 
  the position he was mentally ill. </p>
<p>
  III. Analysis</p>
<p>
  1. Did the trial judge err in permitting the Crown to assert a speculative theory, 
  namely that the appellant participated in planting the knife found at Mr. Khan's 
  side?</p>
<p>
  [56] From the outset of the trial, the Crown took the position that the appellant 
  and/or the appellant's father, with the appellant's knowledge and consent, planted 
  the knife that was found at Mr. Khan's side (the "second knife") and 
  that that conduct amounted to after-the-fact circumstantial evidence of guilt, 
  rebutting the appellant's claim of self-defence. </p>
<p>
  [57] Defence counsel at trial (not Mr. Silverstein) objected to the Crown's 
  position, asserting that there was no evidence to support the Crown's theory; 
  that no possible motive for planting the second knife had been suggested; and 
  that the appellant, at no time, in either his evidence or in his out-of-court 
  statements, ever claimed that Mr. Khan was armed with a knife. </p>
<p>
  [58] The trial judge overruled the defence objections and permitted the Crown 
  to advance its position. In his instructions to the jury concerning post offence 
  conduct, the trial judge said that, from his perspective, there were three possible 
  explanations for the presence of the knife. First, that the appellant's evidence 
  was correct and that Mr. Khan fell "by sheer coincidence" next to 
  the second knife. Second, that the appellant's father planted the knife without 
  the consensual participation of his son. Third, that the appellant planted the 
  second knife or consensually participated in planting it in order to create 
  the false appearance that Mr. Khan was armed. </p>
<p>
  [59] The trial judge also cautioned the jury as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> I must caution you that this item of evidence that is the so-called 
  planted knife is not admissible whatsoever as post offence conduct unless the 
  accused himself planted the knife or consensually participated in its planting. 
  Only then may it be used as post offence conduct.</p>
<p class="indent">I should also caution you that no one item of this type of post 
  offence evidence establishes guilt, it only constitutes an item of evidence 
  which when weighed together with all of the other evidence may establish guilt. 
  Consciousness of fault may be found when an accused acts in a manner which is 
  consistent with conduct expected of a guilty person and inconsistent with conduct 
  expected of an innocent person. In other words, the accused must have acted 
  in a manner which indicates that he was aware that he had acted unlawfully and 
  without a valid defence for his unlawful killing of Aamer Khan. </p>
<p>
  [60] On appeal, the appellant concedes that the evidence at trial revealed a 
  theoretical window of opportunity for the appellant and/or his father to have 
  planted the second knife. However, he contends that there was no other evidence 
  to support the suggestion that the knife was planted or that he participated 
  in planting it and that the trial judge therefore erred by failing to instruct 
  the jury to ignore what was no more than a purely speculative theory. </p>
<p>
  [61] We reject the appellant's submissions. The issue boils down to whether 
  there was sufficient evidence capable of giving rise to an inference that the 
  second knife was planted and that the appellant participated in planting it. 
  In our view, there was. The evidence consisted not only of the evidence of opportunity, 
  but also of the appellant's evidence that he dropped the second knife while 
  trying to get out the front door; the evidence that the second knife was found 
  close to Mr. Khan's body but did not have any blood on it; and the evidence 
  reflected in the 911 calls concerning the difference in the appellant's demeanour 
  during the second 911 call. </p>
<p>
  [62] In our view, it was open to the jury to reject the appellant's explanation 
  for the presence of the second knife as improbable. The appellant gave no real 
  explanation for grabbing two knives, rather than just one, when he fled to the 
  kitchen. Further, it would require a series of coincidences for the second knife 
  to fall close to the eventual location of Mr. Khan's body and yet not be stained 
  by blood. Moreover, because the appellant did not assert that Mr. Khan wielded 
  a knife, if the jury rejected the appellant's explanation, the only rational 
  explanation for the presence of the second knife was that the appellant and/or 
  his father used the opportunity to plant it. Finally, if the jury concluded 
  that the second knife was planted, in our view, it was also open to them to 
  conclude that the appellant was complicit in planting it, because it was improbable 
  that the appellant's father would risk unwittingly jeopardizing his son's position 
  by acting without his son's knowledge and consent.</p>
<p> [63] While it may have been preferable for the trial judge to have instructed 
  the jury specifically that they could not draw the requested inference unless 
  they rejected the appellant's explanation, taken as a whole, the trial judge's 
  instructions were adequate. Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground 
  of appeal<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a>.</p>
<p>
  ii) Did the trial judge err in his instructions to the jury on self-defence?</p>
<p>
  [64] The appellant makes three submissions concerning the trial judge's instructions 
  to the jury on self-defence. We will deal with each submission in turn. </p>
<p>
  [65] The appellant's first submission is that the trial judge's instructions 
  on self-defence were muddled, unclear and difficult to understand. In particular, 
  he claims that the trial judge's references to Mr. Khan being a trespasser and 
  committing a deemed assault on the appellant under s. 41(2) of the Criminal 
  Code made the instructions confusing and improperly deflected the jury's attention 
  from the actions of Mr. Khan that prompted the appellant to act in self-defence.</p>
<p> [66] The trial judge dealt with self-defence in two places in his charge to 
  the jury. As the result of objections made by defence counsel, he also dealt 
  with self-defence as part of a recharge. The impugned passages relating to this 
  submission appear in both portions of the original charge<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> 
  dealing with self-defence. </p>
<p>
  [67] We agree that the references to a deemed assault introduced an element 
  into the charge that may have appeared confusing to the jury. Section 34(2) 
  of the Criminal Code sets out three requirements for the defence. It requires: 
  i) that the accused be unlawfully assaulted; ii) that the accused act under 
  a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm; and iii) that the 
  accused act in the reasonable belief that he cannot otherwise preserve himself. 
  In our view, because they were not really relevant to the second and third requirements 
  under s. 34(2), the trial judge's references to a deemed assault may have seemed 
  confusing. Nevertheless, we reject the appellant's submissions for three reasons. 
  </p>
<p>
  [68] First, the trial judge instructed the jury in both sections of his original 
  charge that it was not only the original assault that was relevant to the second 
  and third requirements of s. 34(2), but also the violence with which the assailant 
  (Mr. Khan) pursued his purpose. </p>
<p>
  [69] Second, in his review of the defence position relating to self-defence, 
  the trial judge made it clear that it was not the deemed assault that the appellant 
  relied on as justifying his actions. In particular, the trial judge said the 
  following: </p>
<p class="indent"> At this time the accused grabbed the deceased by the arm to 
  lead him out of the apartment. The deceased actively resisted and became a trespasser. 
  Mr. Khan's act of resistance deems him to have assaulted the accused in the 
  latter's own home.</p>
<p class="indent">At this point Aamer Khan leapt up in a boxer's pose and punched 
  the accused. They soon fell to the floor in the southern part of the living 
  room. At this point with Khan on top, Khan choked the accused who was soon able 
  to flip him off. The accused then went to the kitchen to clean off blood from 
  his nose with Khan nearby.</p>
<p class="indent">The accused later bolted towards the front door to exit the 
  apartment but stopped at the knife rack. There he instinctively grabbed two 
  knives and attempted to frighten off the crazed Aamer Khan. Khan, however, stepped 
  towards the accused who turned and ran to the front door. At this time the accused 
  discarded one knife and threw it down. The deceased then ran south through the 
  kitchen and around the wall to the living room.</p>
<p class="indent">At that point he grabbed the fan and threw it against the coffee 
  table with the express purpose [of] frightening the accused. The paralyzed accused 
  was [unable] to open the door before the crazed Aamer Khan grabbed him from 
  behind and swung him against the east wall in the foyer. At this time they were 
  face to face and Khan grabbed at the knife for the purpose of killing [the appellant].</p>
<p class="indent">The crazed Khan had already threatened to kill [the appellant]. 
  [The appellant] was in mortal fear of dying. He lashed out with the knife in 
  a sustained but quick frenzy, stabbed the struggling and moving Aamer Khan seven 
  times. At no time did the accused stab the deceased in the back from the rear. 
  [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [70] Third, during pre-charge discussions, experienced defence counsel specifically 
  requested that the trial judge refer to s. 41(2) of the Criminal Code in his 
  instructions to the jury concerning self-defence. Further, defence counsel did 
  not raise this objection, which has been raised for the first time on appeal, 
  at the conclusion of the trial judge's charge to the jury.</p>
<p>
  [71] Taking all of these factors into account, we conclude that it would have 
  been clear to the jury that while the deemed assault referred to by the trial 
  judge was capable of satisfying the first requirement of s. 34(2) of the Criminal 
  Code, it was other aspects of the evidence, including the appellant's evidence 
  concerning Mr. Khan's previous behaviour on the night in question and concerning 
  Mr. Khan's threat to kill the appellant and his attempt to choke him that were 
  relevant to the second and third requirements of the section.</p>
<p>
  [72] The appellant's second submission relating to self-defence is that the 
  trial judge erred in law in two respects: first, by instructing the jury that 
  the appellant was only entitled to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr. Khan if 
  his actions were in fact a last resort and second, by instructing the jury that 
  the appellant's prior knowledge of Mr. Khan's disposition was relevant to the 
  question of whether he believed he was being unlawfully assaulted. The impugned 
  passage relating to these submissions appears in the second portion of the original 
  charge dealing with self-defence. We will set out the impugned passage for ease 
  of reference: </p>
<p class="indent"> I turn now to general comments about section 34(2) and the 
  use of deadly force in self-defence. The starting point and first essential 
  element of the defence of self-defence is the requirement that the deceased 
  (sic) must have a reasonable belief of serious bodily harm, which may be actually 
  attempted or threatened.</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, in fact, there is an evidentiary basis for a deemed 
  assault. In assessing the honesty and reasonableness of the accused's belief 
  that he was being unlawfully assaulted you must consider the accused's prior 
  relationship with the deceased and the accused's prior knowledge of the deceased's 
  disposition to act violently. [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it's the opposite. The evidence seems to be the 
  deceased had a disposition to act peacefully. Thus, the defence of self-defence 
  permits a person to kill or cause serious bodily harm to another person only 
  as a last resort for self-preservation and the limited and stringent circumstances 
  of necessity described in section 34(2) of the Criminal Code. </p>
<p>
  [73] The appellant points out, correctly in our view, that the "last resort" 
  reference creates an impression of an objective test in relation to the third 
  requirement of s. 34(2). The proper test requires simply that an accused reasonably 
  believe he cannot otherwise preserve himself. The appellant also submits that 
  while his knowledge of the deceased's prior disposition may have been relevant 
  to the issue of the reasonableness of his belief concerning the extent of any 
  threat, it was not relevant to his belief concerning whether he was being unlawfully 
  assaulted. </p>
<p>
  [74] We would not give effect to either of these submissions. </p>
<p>
  [75] In relation to the appellant's first concern, the trial judge instructed 
  the jury on several occasions that the third requirement of s. 34(2) has both 
  a subjective and an objective component. In other words, the trial judge instructed 
  the jury that the third requirement is not simply an objective test. In the 
  face of these explicit references, we are not persuaded that one brief reference 
  to self-defence permitting the infliction of harm "only as a last resort" 
  would have misled the jury in any way concerning the third requirement of s. 
  34(2).</p>
<p>
  [76] In relation to the appellant's second concern, we reject the appellant's 
  submission for two reasons. First, this court made it clear in R. v. Currie 
  (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 190, that an actual assault is not a prerequisite to 
  a defence in relation to the first requirement of s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. 
  Rather the relevant question is whether the accused person reasonably believes 
  in the circumstances that he is being unlawfully assaulted. In this case, the 
  appellant's evidence concerning how the struggle commenced was not clear and 
  it was open to the jury to find that the appellant acted, at least initially, 
  in response to an apprehended assault. The issue of whether the appellant reasonably 
  believed he was being assaulted was therefore potentially a live issue for determination. 
  </p>
<p>
  [77] Second, the appellant relied on evidence of Mr. Khan's deteriorating mental 
  and emotional state as evidence capable of supporting his claim of self-defence. 
  Defence counsel at trial not only did not object to the impugned instruction, 
  he asked the trial judge to go further and discuss the impact of the appellant's 
  knowledge of Mr. Khan's belief in Jinns in assessing the appellant's perception 
  of the need to use deadly force. Although this request related primarily to 
  the second requirement of s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code, similar considerations 
  may apply when assessing the reasonableness of an accused person's belief that 
  he is being unlawfully assaulted under the first requirement of s. 34(2): see 
  R. v. Cinous (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.). If the jury approached self-defence 
  on the basis of an apprehended assault, the appellant's knowledge of Mr. Khan's 
  mental and emotional state and his disposition for violence were relevant factors 
  in assessing the reasonableness of the appellant's belief that he was being 
  assaulted.</p>
<p>
  [78] We conclude that the trial judge did not err in instructing the jury that 
  they could consider the appellant's knowledge of Mr. Khan's disposition in assessing 
  the reasonableness of the appellant's belief that he was being unlawfully assaulted. 
  Moreover, in light of the appellant's reliance on evidence of Mr. Khan's deteriorating 
  mental and emotional state and his belief in Jinns, the trial judge did not 
  err in making what amounted to a passing reference to Mr. Khan's disposition 
  to act peacefully: see R. v. Diu (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [79] The appellant's third submission relating to self-defence is that the trial 
  judge erred by failing to adequately review the defence evidence that supported 
  the appellant's claim of self-defence and by failing to relate the defence evidence 
  to the requirements of s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. In particular, the appellant 
  points out that the trial judge failed entirely to review the psychiatric evidence 
  that supported the appellant's position except when setting out the position 
  of the defence and that the trial judge failed to make any references to the 
  defence evidence when reviewing the law of self-defence. </p>
<p>
  [80] In addition, the appellant asserts that the trial judge exacerbated this 
  error by saying that Drs. Hill and Klassen disagreed over whether Mr. Khan "was 
  actually experiencing a major mental breakdown of some unknown name on the night 
  in question". The appellant contends that this comment seriously mischaracterized 
  the psychiatric evidence and indicated that the trial judge preferred the Crown's 
  evidence to that of the defence. </p>
<p>
  [81] The appellant submits that the trial judge should have instructed the jury 
  that the appellant's evidence, along with other evidence in the trial, indicated 
  that Mr. Khan's mental state was significantly compromised at the time of the 
  events in issue and that he should have explained to the jury that this evidence 
  supported the appellant's defence.</p>
<p>
  [82] Once again, we reject the appellant's submissions. There is no precise 
  formula concerning how a trial judge must go about relating the evidence to 
  the applicable law in a particular case. In this instance, the trial judge reviewed 
  the evidence supporting both the Crown and the defence positions when setting 
  out those positions. In effect, he explained to the jury how the evidence supporting 
  each side's position related to the law. </p>
<p>
  [83] Further, in our view, the trial judge did not err when he said that Drs. 
  Hill and Klassen disagreed concerning whether Mr. Khan was experiencing a major 
  mental breakdown. The closest Dr. Klassen came to supporting the defence position, 
  is in those portions of his evidence set out in paragraphs 54 and 55 above. 
  As we read his evidence, Dr. Klassen never abandoned his position that there 
  was simply not enough evidence to make a proper diagnosis. </p>
<p>
  [84] Finally, the trial judge specifically referred the jury to Dr. Hill's opinion 
  that Mr. Khan was suffering from a major mental illness, to Mr. Khan's family 
  physician's notes, and to the evidence of the independent witnesses that the 
  defence claimed supported that opinion. Considering the charge as a whole, we 
  are not persuaded that the appellant was in any way prejudiced by the manner 
  in which the trial judge chose to review the evidence favouring the appellant 
  and to explain how that evidence related to the applicable law. </p>
<p>
  3. Did the trial judge err in his instructions to the jury on reasonable doubt?</p>
<p>
  [85] The appellant submits that the trial judge made two errors in his instructions 
  to the jury on reasonable doubt. First, in response to an objection by the Crown 
  concerning defence counsel's closing address, the trial judge gave the following 
  instruction to the jury: </p>
<p class="indent">
  You have taken an oath to render a true verdict based solely on the evidence. 
  [Defence counsel] spent a great deal of time referring to cases where the accused 
  had been wrongfully convicted. Obviously, you must not be frightened from doing 
  your sworn duty. If you were to be preoccupied with the idea that your verdict 
  may result in a miscarriage of justice you will be unable to assess the evidence 
  in an objective and dispassionate manner, totally fair to both sides.</p>
<p>
  [86] The appellant contends that the foregoing instruction amounted to an improper 
  invitation to the jury to ignore the criminal standard of proof and that it 
  is the effective equivalent of the "timid juror instruction", disapproved 
  of by this court: R. v. Carriere (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 51 (Ont. C.A.); R. 
  v. Karthiresu (2000), 129 O.A.C. 291. </p>
<p> [87] Second, although this was a post-Lifchus<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> 
  charge, the trial judge failed to refer to the fact that the criminal standard 
  of proof is higher than the civil standard or to explain where on the continuum 
  the criminal standard lies. When viewed in the context of the trial judge's 
  comment during defence counsel's closing address to the effect that "moral certainty" 
  is not a proper definition of reasonable doubt, the cumulative effect of these 
  errors makes it impossible to conclude that the jury correctly understood the 
  standard of proof.</p>
<p>
  [88] We would not give effect to this ground of appeal for three reasons.</p>
<p>
  [89] First, we reject the appellant's submission that the instruction set out 
  at paragraph 86 above is the effective equivalent of the "timid juror instruction", 
  or that it amounted to an invitation to the jury to ignore the criminal standard 
  of proof. The impugned instruction was an issue-specific instruction given in 
  response to the following comments made by defence counsel during his closing 
  address: </p>
<p class="indent"> The application of the principle (presumption of innocence) 
  does not always succeed in preventing the conviction of innocent people. Anyone 
  who reads the newspapers and follows other forms of media knows that even the 
  best systems fail on occasion. In England there are all the I.R.A. cases, the 
  Birmingham 6, the McGuire 7, the Guilford 4, in the Name of the Father, the 
  movie, all situations where people were wrongfully convicted.</p>
<p class="indent">In the United States in November of 1998 there was a conference 
  in Chicago, the topic of discussion of the fact that since 1976 in the United 
  States 74 convicts on death row have been exonerated, most of them by D.N.A. 
  evidence and that's just the capital murder cases. That's three a year. Those 
  were all mistakes that were made by hard working and honest jurors.</p>
<p class="indent">A fellow named Hurricane Rubin Carter, spent over a decade in 
  jail for three murders committed by somebody else. Bob Dylan wrote a song about 
  it. There was a book written about it. And there's an upcoming movie about it. 
  Mr. Carter is now a director of an association headquartered here in Toronto 
  called the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted, which is an association, 
  which lobbies on behalf of such people.</p>
<p class="indent">We've had examples in Canada of failure of our system, Wilson 
  McQues' case, Donald Marshall, David Milgaard, Guy Paul Morin. Even our own 
  legal history is sprinkled with miscarriages of justice. The fact is no system 
  is perfect but the presumption of innocence is the most effective bastion we 
  have against such failures. It's really the only and the main principle that 
  we have to prevent that from happening. If we do not apply the presumption of 
  innocence we don't fail any particular accused, we fail ourselves as members 
  of this community.</p>
<p>
  [90] The impugned instruction was an acceptable response to defence counsel's 
  remarks appealing to the emotions and fears of the jury. It was given at page 
  seventy-two of a seventy-nine-page jury charge and was not in any way linked 
  to the definition of reasonable doubt, which appears at pages six through eight 
  of the charge. In particular, the instruction emphasized the jurors' duty to 
  consider the evidence in "an objective and dispassionate manner, totally 
  fair to both sides" and did not, in any way, link reasonable doubt with 
  avoiding their responsibilities.</p>
<p>
  [91] Second, when the trial judge interjected during the course of defence counsel's 
  closing address, he was responding to the following comment made by defence 
  counsel: </p>
<p class="indent"> What is proof beyond a reasonable doubt? There have been many 
  different definitions given over the years for this and the one that you must 
  follow most closely is the one given to you by his Honour.</p>
<p class="indent">The Crown may mention some definitions, I do not. There is one 
  definition that has been used in the past which I would ask you to consider 
  and keep in mind. It is to the effect that you must be, based on the evidence 
  you hear, morally certain of guilt.</p>
<p>
  [92] The trial judge said simply, "[t]hat's not the proper test&#133;moral 
  certainty is not part of the definition&#133;it shouldn't be used". Considering 
  the trial judge's comments in context, it would have been obvious to the jury 
  that they were directed at the proper wording of the test. In our view, it is 
  fanciful to suggest that the jury would have concluded that they could convict 
  the accused even if they were not "certain" of his guilt or that they 
  were otherwise misled concerning the standard of proof.</p>
<p> [93] Third, although the trial judge did not comply precisely with the Lifchus 
  model, he did use much of its language, he referred to the criminal standard 
  as a "higher" standard of proof, and he gave a proper W.(D.)<a href="#a">[4]</a><a name="4"></a> 
  instruction. In the circumstances, we see no basis for concluding that there 
  is a reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the standard of proof. 
</p>
<p>
  4. Did the trial judge err in his instructions to the jury on motive?</p>
<p>
  [94] At the conclusion of his instructions to the jury on the subject of motive, 
  the trial judge said the following: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The defence position is that the absence of motive is significant in this case. 
  The Crown says no it is not because the accused acted impulsively. You will 
  decide whether or not it is [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [95] The appellant submits that it was incumbent on the trial judge to instruct 
  the jury that, as a matter of law, absence of motive is significant and that 
  it can, by itself, raise a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [96] The trial judge's complete instructions on motive were as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> In this case the defence submits that it has demonstrated that 
  the accused &#133; had no motive whatsoever to unlawfully kill his best friend&#133; 
  It seems that the Crown concedes that and the Crown's position is that [the 
  Appellant] killed [the deceased] because he lost his self-control in the particular 
  circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">Motive may be defined as a person's ultimate end, purposes or 
  object. Motive is the ulterior end for which an intentional act is done.</p>
<p class="indent">Having said that, motive is generally relevant to the proof 
  of a crime. I must add, in fact, the Crown is not required to prove motive as 
  an essential element of an offence. However, to prove absence of motive is nonetheless 
  an important factor to be considered in whether the accused killed the deceased 
  unlawfully. The defence position is that the absence of motive is significant 
  in this case. The Crown says no it is not because the accused acted impulsively. 
  You will decide whether or not it is. </p>
<p>
  [97] In our view, these instructions were adequate and appropriate in the circumstances. 
  Although the trial judge might properly have added that proven absence of motive 
  may, of itself, give rise to a reasonable doubt, we conclude that, in light 
  of the instructions that he gave, the trial judge did not commit reversible 
  error by failing to give this instruction.</p>
<p>
  [98] In particular, the trial judge told the jury that absence of motive was 
  conceded and that it was an important factor for the jury to consider in determining 
  whether the appellant killed Mr. Khan unlawfully. However, he also set out the 
  Crown's position that the appellant and Mr. Khan got into an argument, and that 
  the appellant lost his self-control in repeatedly stabbing his unarmed victim. 
  In this context, proven absence of motive would not be significant. </p>
<p>
  [99] In our view, the trial judge highlighted the real issue the jury had to 
  determine when considering motive, namely, whether proven absence of motive 
  was significant in the context of this case. He also made it clear to the jury 
  that, if they were satisfied it was significant, proven absence of motive would 
  be an important feature in assessing the appellant's guilt. Accordingly, we 
  would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  5. Did the trial judge err in admitting hearsay evidence of a statement allegedly 
  made by Mr. Khan on the morning before his death?</p>
<p>
  [100] As already noted, the Crown called Mr. Khan's brother, Aatif Khan, in 
  reply, to testify that, on the morning before his brother died, he heard his 
  brother explain to their grandmother that he made a cut in his beard accidentally 
  and decided to shave it off.</p>
<p>
  [101] Defence counsel at trial objected to Aatif Khan's evidence, saying that 
  it was inadmissible hearsay. In ruling Mr. Khan's statement admissible, the 
  trial judge found that Mr. Khan's explanation for shaving his beard was sufficiently 
  contemporaneous to the event to justify its reception.</p>
<p>
  [102] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in holding that Aatif 
  Khan's evidence was admissible for two reasons. First, because there was insufficient 
  evidence to find that the statement was made contemporaneously to the event. 
  Second, because there was insufficient indicia of reliability to warrant its 
  admission.</p>
<p>
  [103] We agree with the appellant's submissions. </p>
<p>
  [104] In ruling Aatif Khan's evidence admissible, the trial judge relied on 
  an excerpt of his evidence from the preliminary inquiry. According to Crown 
  counsel at trial, the excerpt did not clearly indicate at what time of day the 
  statement was made. Crown counsel confirmed that it was the first time Aatif 
  Khan saw his brother without the beard, and the trial judge concluded, "[l]ikely 
  he's just shaved it &#133; at least within the recent past". </p>
<p>
  [105] At trial, Aatif Khan testified that he noticed that his brother had shaved 
  his beard "around morning time" of the particular day. He confirmed 
  that he heard some conversation about his brother having shaved his beard that 
  morning; in particular, he heard his grandmother ask his brother, "you 
  shaved your beard". </p>
<p>
  [106] In our view, Mr. Khan's utterance does not meet the necessary threshold 
  to qualify for admission as res gestae.</p>
<p>
  [107] In J. Sopinka, S.N. Lederman, A.W. Bryant, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 
  2nd ed. (Toronto, Butterworths, 1998) the authors describe two situations in 
  which the courts have properly invoked the res gestae doctrine to admit utterances 
  offered for their truth: (1) declarations accompanying and explaining relevant 
  acts, and (2) spontaneous exclamations. Here, Mr. Khan's utterance could not 
  qualify under the second heading, as it was not the result of a startling occurrence 
  or excitement-provoking event. </p>
<p>
  [108] As for the first heading, this court set out the parameters of admissibility 
  in R. v. J.E.F. (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 457 at para. 30 as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The words are considered to be so inter-related to a fact in issue that they 
  become a part of the fact itself. To qualify, the words must introduce the fact 
  in issue, explain its nature, or form in connection with it one continuous transaction. 
  [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [109] In this instance, there was no clear evidence concerning the proximity 
  of Mr. Khan's utterance to his prior action. Moreover, even if it could reasonably 
  be inferred that Mr. Khan spoke to his grandmother soon after shaving his beard, 
  his words were not so inter-related with his actions as to form one continuous 
  transaction. Rather, they were an after-the-fact explanation given in response 
  to his grandmother's inquiry and they lacked the circumstantial guarantees of 
  reliability associated with the res gestae exception. Put another way, it is 
  possible in the circumstances that Mr. Khan was simply making an excuse to his 
  grandmother.</p>
<p>
  [110] Further, Mr. Khan's utterance would not qualify for admission under the 
  principled exception to the hearsay rule for the same reason that it does not 
  qualify as res gestae: the surrounding circumstances do not provide sufficient 
  indicia of reliability to warrant admission. </p>
<p>
  [111] However, we see no reasonable possibility that the verdict would have 
  been different had this error not been made for three reasons. First, it became 
  obvious during cross-examination that Aatif Khan had an interest in diminishing 
  the defence theory that his brother's conduct in shaving his beard was a significant 
  event. </p>
<p>
  [112] Second, even if the jury accepted Aatif Khan's evidence about his brother's 
  statement to their grandmother, it remained open to the jury to reject Mr. Khan's 
  statement as untrue. There was a substantial body of additional evidence going 
  to the question of Mr. Khan's deteriorating mental state at the time of his 
  death. If the jury did not reject the other evidence, in our view, it is unlikely 
  that they would have accepted that Mr. Khan's statement to their grandmother 
  was true. </p>
<p>
  [113] Third, even if the jury accepted that Mr. Khan made the statement to his 
  grandmother and that it was true, given the significant body of evidence relating 
  to Mr. Khan's mental state it is unlikely that excluding this single piece of 
  evidence would have changed the outcome of the trial. </p>
<p>
  [114] Taking account of all of our findings concerning this appeal, we are satisfied 
  that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was occasioned as the result 
  of this error.</p>
<p>
  6. When Mubin Shaikh was unable to recall whether the appellant told him that 
  Mr. Khan tried to choke him, did the trial judge err in refusing to admit Ismail 
  Ibrahim's evidence that Mr. Shaikh told Mr. Ibrahim that the appellant did say 
  that?</p>
<p>
  [115] As already noted, the Crown called Mubin Shaikh to testify about a conversation 
  that he had with the appellant concerning the circumstances of Mr. Khan's death. 
  This evidence was admissible for the truth of its content as an admission by 
  the appellant adduced by the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [116] In cross-examination, Mr. Shaikh said that he was unable to recall whether 
  he told Mr. Ibrahim that the appellant said Mr. Khan tried to choke him. Subsequently, 
  defence counsel asked that Mr. Ibrahim be permitted to testify to that effect 
  during the defence case for the limited purpose of proving that the appellant 
  made the statement to Mr. Shaikh. In particular, defence counsel was concerned 
  that, if the Crown cross-examined the appellant on his failure to tell Mr. Shaikh 
  that he was choked, then without Mr. Ibrahim's evidence, the jury would be left 
  with a misleading impression of what occurred. </p>
<p>
  [117] The trial judge refused to admit Mr. Ibrahim's evidence, saying that it 
  would have to go in for its truth and that it was not admissible for that purpose. 
  He concluded that the evidence would amount to double hearsay, that there were 
  no indicia of reliability surrounding either the making or the repetition of 
  the statement, and that the evidence was inherently unreliable because the alleged 
  statement was said and then repeated well after the event. </p>
<p>
  [118] On appeal, the appellant contends that, because the Crown chose to adduce 
  the appellant's statement for the truth of its content, the trial judge erred 
  in classifying Mr. Ibrahim's evidence as double hearsay. Further, since Mr. 
  Ibrahim's evidence corroborated the appellant's version of his confrontation 
  with Mr. Khan, the appellant contends that it was patently reliable. Finally, 
  he submits that the trial judge ought to have applied a lesser standard of admissibility 
  to this evidence because the defence adduced it: see R. v. Brown (2002), 162 
  C.C.C. (3d) 257 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [119] We reject the appellant's submissions. Had the trial judge acceded to 
  defence counsel's request, Mr. Ibrahim's evidence concerning what Mr. Shaikh 
  told him would have been hearsay. Defence counsel stated that he would be content 
  that the statement not be admitted for the truth of its content. However, he 
  did not ask that Mr. Shaikh be given an opportunity to adopt Mr. Ibrahim's evidence. 
  Mr. Shaikh had already agreed that he may have told Mr. Ibrahim that the appellant 
  said that Mr. Khan tried to choke him (the appellant), but that he was not sure. 
  In the circumstances, there was no purpose in admitting Mr. Ibrahim's evidence 
  as a prior inconsistent statement. We see no basis for interfering with the 
  trial judge's conclusion that Mr. Ibrahim's evidence failed to meet the threshold 
  requirement of reliability and that it was not therefore admissible under the 
  principled exception to the hearsay rule. </p>
<p>
  [120] Fourth, we do not accept the appellant's submission that the trial judge 
  erred in this case by failing to apply a lesser standard of admissibility to 
  defence evidence. While it is open to a trial judge to admit defence evidence 
  based on lower standards of admissibility in some circumstance, a minimal threshold 
  guarantee of reliability is still required: see R. v. Williams (1985), 18 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 356. We see no such guarantee in this case. Further, prior to making his 
  final ruling, the trial judge said that if Crown counsel cross-examined the 
  appellant on this issue and the appellant asserted that he told Mr. Shaikh that 
  Mr. Khan choked him, the trial judge would tell the jury that the appellant 
  probably did say that to Mr. Shaikh. Crown counsel did not cross-examine the 
  appellant on this issue. </p>
<p>
  [121] In the circumstances, in our view, the trial judge's admissibility ruling 
  was correct and his caution to Crown counsel struck an appropriate balance between 
  a strict application of the rules of evidence and fairness to the defence. </p>
<p>
  7. Did the trial judge err by refusing to permit the defence to re-address the 
  jury after Crown counsel changed his theory, in his closing address, concerning 
  how a bloodstain was deposited on the balcony door?</p>
<p>
  [122] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in refusing to permit 
  defence counsel to re-address the jury after the Crown introduced a new theory 
  of liability in his closing address. The circumstances giving rise to this ground 
  of appeal are as follows.</p>
<p>
  [123] In his opening address to the jury, Crown counsel suggested that the appellant 
  stabbed Mr. Khan initially in the chest and then stabbed him repeatedly in the 
  back as Mr. Khan tried to escape through the front door. The appellant submits 
  that it was the Crown's position throughout the trial that the appellant deposited 
  Mr. Khan's blood on the balcony door by brushing his knife against the door 
  as he fled from his apartment.</p>
<p>
  [124] However, in his closing address to the jury, Crown counsel theorized that 
  Mr. Khan suffered the defensive wounds to his hands during an initial confrontation 
  in the kitchen. Crown counsel suggested that Mr. Khan went searching for an 
  escape route and in doing so, smeared blood from his hands on to the balcony 
  door. Crown counsel also theorized that the appellant pursued Mr. Khan, caught 
  up with him in the north part of the living room near the foyer, and stabbed 
  him five times in the back as Mr. Khan attempted to flee out the front door.</p>
<p>
  [125] Following Crown counsel's closing, defence counsel submitted that Crown 
  counsel had introduced a new factual theory to explain the infliction of the 
  wounds and the bloodstain on the patio door, and he requested the opportunity 
  to re-address the jury. The trial judge refused defence counsel's request. </p>
<p>
  [126] We reject the appellant's submission that the trial judge erred in refusing 
  to permit defence counsel to re-address the jury for three reasons.</p>
<p>
  [127] First, contrary to the appellant's submissions, Crown counsel did not 
  advance any position, in his opening address, concerning how the bloodstain 
  on the patio door was deposited. What Crown counsel did say was the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> The friends had an argument, perhaps it was over Mr. Khan's 
  refusal to leave so that [the appellant] could study for his exams. It escalated 
  into a fight.</p>
<p class="indent">[The appellant] went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife from 
  the kitchen knife rack. This made the fight very one-sided because Mr. Khan 
  didn't have a knife. Mr. Khan did his best to defend himself with his hands 
  against [the appellant's] knife. Mr. Khan's hands were cut badly. [The appellant] 
  kept up his attack.</p>
<p class="indent">With Mr. Khan's hands now badly cut [the appellant] was able 
  to stab Mr. Khan once in the chest, and once on his side. Mr. Khan was badly 
  hurt and bleeding. He tried to flee. He turned away from the fight and pushed 
  to the front door of the apartment. Bleeding all the while he desperately tried 
  to unlock the door so he could escape. In doing so, he smeared blood around 
  the front door around the entrance but [the appellant] kept up his attack as 
  Mr. Khan retreated. </p>
<p class="indent">[The appellant] stabbed Mr. Khan five times in the back. &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. Khan fell back from the &#133;door, and died where he landed. 
  [The appellant] suffered only minor injuries. He had very little blood on him. 
  He knew he was in trouble and had to do something. Mr. Khan's body was blocking 
  the front entrance so he decided to climb out onto the balcony and into a nearby 
  apartment&#133;. </p>
<p>
  [128] Second, even if the cumulative effect of Crown counsel's opening address, 
  the testimony of the Crown's biologist, and Crown counsel's cross-examination 
  of the appellant raised a clear inference that the Crown's theory was that the 
  appellant deposited the bloodstain on the patio door with his knife, the Crown 
  biologist's supplementary report made that theory untenable. Experienced defence 
  counsel filed the supplementary report as part of the defence case and would 
  have realized that this theory that the appellant deposited Mr. Khan's blood 
  on the balcony door was no longer tenable.</p>
<p>
  [129] Third, reduced to its essentials, the Crown's theory was that the appellant 
  injured Mr. Khan in an initial confrontation, pursued him, and then stabbed 
  him in the back as Mr. Khan attempted to flee. In our view, the Crown's ultimate 
  position did not significantly depart from its initial theory. Moreover, the 
  appellant's counsel closed to the jury saying that it was Mr. Khan who deposited 
  the bloodstain on the patio door. In our view, the appellant has not demonstrated 
  that he suffered any prejudice as a result of the manner in which Crown counsel 
  closed to the jury. </p>
<p>
  8. Did the trial judge err by failing to warn the jury sufficiently concerning 
  inflammatory submissions made by the Crown?</p>
<p> [130] At the beginning of his closing address to the jury, Crown counsel referred 
  to the familiar understanding of stabbing someone else in the back as "mean, 
  underhanded and unexpected" conduct. He also referred to a dictionary definition 
  of "backstabber", as "one who attacks unfairly". Finally, he described stabbing 
  another person in the back as conduct that is "so clearly and obviously wrong 
  [that] it becomes the yardstick by which we measure other bad acts"<a href="#a">[5]</a><a name="5"></a>.</p>
<p>
  [131] Defence counsel objected to Crown counsel's language. In his charge to 
  the jury, the trial judge cautioned the jury as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> The word "backstabber". Crown counsel referred to a dictionary 
  definition of the word "backstabber" as meaning a person who treats another 
  person unfairly. Let me relate the word to this case inasmuch as the accused's 
  version is that he stabbed Aamer Khan in the back while they were engaged face 
  to face in a death struggle. In other words, at that time he was acting lawfully 
  in self-defence.</p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, the Crown's version is that the accused stabbed 
  the deceased Aamer Khan five times from behind while Khan was fleeing from the 
  accused. Obviously, you should<a href="#a">[6]</a><a name="6"></a> reject the 
  accused's evidence as untrue on this point and find as a fact that the accused 
  did indeed stab the deceased five times in the back from the rear, it is in 
  this limited and most restricted sense of the word "backstabber" that the Crown 
  has used that word to characterize the accused's criminal conduct.</p>
<p>
  [132] The appellant submits that Crown counsel's language was inflammatory and 
  that the trial judge's caution to the jury was insufficient in the circumstances. 
  The appellant contends that the trial judge should have admonished Crown counsel 
  in the presence of the jury and instructed them to disregard completely the 
  "backstabbing" analogy.</p>
<p>
  [133] We agree that, in using the term "backstabber" in the manner 
  that he did, Crown counsel crossed the line between rhetoric and impermissible 
  language. </p>
<p>
  [134] The appellant did not contest that he stabbed Mr. Khan in the back. However, 
  he claimed that he acted in lawful self-defence during the course of a face-to-face 
  struggle. Even if the jury rejected his defence of self-defence, the appellant 
  claimed that he did not intend to kill Mr. Khan and that Mr. Khan provoked him. 
  In this context, Crown counsel's references to the appellant as a backstabber 
  and to the moral blameworthiness of that conduct were really only relevant to 
  the Crown's assertion that the appellant stabbed Mr. Khan from the rear. The 
  analogy had no application if the stabbing occurred in the context of a face-to-face 
  struggle, and it was capable of unfairly prejudicing the defence if the issue 
  came down to provocation. In our view, Crown counsel's reference to all backstabbing 
  as being underhanded and improper was an unfair attempt to undermine all aspects 
  the appellant's defence. </p>
<p>
  [135] Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the trial judge's instructions on 
  this issue struck an appropriate balance in terms of informing the jury of the 
  limited sense in which Crown counsel's analogy was appropriate and at the same 
  time cautioning them not to use the analogy for an improper purpose. They focussed 
  the jury's attention on the sole appropriate basis for considering the analogy 
  without diverting their attention to extraneous issues. We are not satisfied 
  that additional instructions condemning Crown counsel's use of language were 
  necessary in the circumstances.</p>
<p>
  9. Did the trial judge's conduct raise a reasonable apprehension that the appellant 
  did not receive a fair trial?</p>
<p>
  [136] The appellant relies on three aspects of the trial judge's conduct in 
  claiming that it gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. </p>
<p>
  [137] First, the appellant submits that in summarizing the Crown's case for 
  the jury, the trial judge added his own theory of the appellant's guilt and 
  presented the Crown's position in a more cogent manner than Crown counsel had, 
  thereby abandoning the position and appearance of neutrality. </p>
<p>
  [138] We reject this submission. </p>
<p>
  [139] In summarizing the Crown's position in his charge to the jury, the trial 
  judge said: </p>
<p class="indent"> Mr. Khan had to have been moving from location to location 
  in order to have deposited the blood in different locations.</p>
<p class="indent">The defensive wounds to the hands would not have prevented Mr. 
  Khan from fleeing his assailant, even the initial wounds to the chest and side 
  would not have prevented Mr. Khan from moving about. They were the least serious 
  wounds and were not life threatening. But Mr. Khan could not [have moved about 
  far] after the [two] lung puncturing wounds to his back. Furthermore, Khan's 
  several layers of clothing prevented immediate bleeding though the smears in 
  the kitchen and the balcony door likely came from the defensive wounds to his 
  hands during the flight from his assailant [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [140] We agree that Crown counsel at trial did not refer specifically in his 
  closing address to the possibility that the wounds to Mr. Khan's chest and side 
  were inflicted during the initial confrontation. However, he did not present 
  any specific theory concerning when those wounds were inflicted and his submissions 
  concerning the order in which the wounds occurred focussed on accounting for 
  the bloodstains throughout the apartment. In our view, the possibility noted 
  by the trial judge flowed naturally from the Crown's closing and did not constitute 
  a new theory of liability. Significantly, Crown counsel had referred to the 
  same possibility in his opening address. </p>
<p> [141] Second, the appellant contends that, throughout the trial, the trial 
  judge showed great deference to Crown counsel, while treating defence counsel 
  in a markedly different manner. The appellant submits that the trial judge's 
  conduct rendered the trial unfair and gives rise to a reasonable apprehension 
  of bias. In particular, the appellant relies on the following examples: </p>
<ul>
  <li>when defence counsel submitted that the trial judge was interfering with 
    his cross-examination, the trial judge said that he was trying to help defence 
    counsel and that he did not "need any of his insults";</li>
  <li>when defence counsel sought to elicit that the witness Ismail Ibrahim went 
    to the hospital and saw Mr. Khan clean-shaven, the trial judge excused the 
    jury. In the colloquy that ensued, the trial judge referred to defence counsel 
    as "insolent" and "junior and inexperienced". The trial judge subsequently 
    dismissed a defence mistrial application without hearing submissions;</li>
  <li>during the Crown's cross-examination of the defence psychiatrist, the trial 
    judge criticized defence counsel in the presence of the jury and once again 
    dismissed a defence mistrial application without hearing submissions;</li>
  <li>the trial judge refused to exclude the witness Aatif Khan while defence 
    counsel made submissions on a proposed line of cross-examination; and</li>
  <li>after the defence closing address, the trial judge accused defence counsel 
    of being unprofessional and attacking him on a personal level.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [142] We agree that the trial judge was at times perfunctory and discourteous 
  in dealing with defence counsel. However, we note that, both when making submissions 
  and in response to the trial judge's rulings, defence counsel was, at times, 
  argumentative and accusatory. Based on our review of the record, the trial judge's 
  conduct did not deter experienced defence counsel from making submissions, nor 
  did it inappropriately curtail his cross-examination of witnesses. In the circumstances, 
  we see no basis for concluding that the trial judge's conduct rendered the trial 
  unfair or that it was such as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
<p> [143] In terms of the specific incidents cited by the appellant, we reject 
  the appellant's submissions. Our comments follow the same order as is set out 
  above: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the trial judge's comments were made in the absence of the jury. In this 
    court, the appellant did not pursue his submission that the trial judge interfered 
    unduly with his cross-examination and our review of the record does not bear 
    that out. The trial judge's comments do not sustain the appellant's submissions;</li>
  <li>the trial judge's comments were made after defence counsel failed to respond 
    to the trial judge's inquiry about where his questions were going. Once again, 
    in our view, the trial judge's comments do not sustain the appellant's submissions;</li>
  <li>the trial judge intervened during Crown counsel's cross-examination of the 
    defence psychiatrist to clarify that it was defence counsel who had determined 
    which excerpts of certain material the psychiatrist received and set out certain 
    hypothetical assumptions. Defence counsel interpreted the trial judge's clarification 
    as criticism and as warranting a mistrial. We do not;</li>
  <li>while it may have been preferable for the trial judge to have acceded to 
    defence counsel's request to excuse the witness, it was within his discretion 
    not to do so. Ultimately, the trial judge determined that the proposed questions 
    were not relevant;</li>
  <li>the trial judge's comments were made in the absence of the jury in response 
    to the Crown raising an issue concerning the following portion of defence 
    counsel's closing : </li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">
  In our system, unlike others, trial Judges are permitted comment on those issues. 
  The trial judge is also required to summarize the evidence for you. You may 
  assume because of a trial judge's theoretical lack of interest in the outcome 
  of a case that summary is reliable and that all of the important evidence has 
  been laid out for you. Please do not make any such assumption. Please do not 
  assume what is said to you by the trial judge in this or any case about his 
  views on the evidence are neutral. You must base that judgment on what you have 
  seen happen over the course of this case.</p>
<p>
  Crown counsel submitted that there had been an implied and unfair criticism 
  of the trial judge. The trial judge responded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I'm not concerned about that. [Defence counsel] is not happy with me, I'm obviously 
  not happy with him&#133;there is no professionalism in this case and it's obviously 
  a personal attack&#133;that's not to say I'm going to take sides at the end. 
  I don't intend to do so. I try to give a position on both sides fairly and dispassionately 
  and that's it.</p>
<p>
  Although it may not be precisely clear what defence counsel intended, his remarks 
  are certainly open to the interpretation that they constituted an attack on 
  the trial judge's neutrality. Given the totality of circumstances, once again 
  we are not persuaded that the trial judge's comments sustain the appellant's 
  submissions. </p>
<p>
  [144] Third, the appellant submits that the trial judge favoured the Crown in 
  his evidentiary rulings. Our conclusions on appeal do not support this submission.</p>
<p>
  [145] We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  10. Was the Crown's conduct inflammatory and inconsistent with the Crown's quasi-judicial 
  role?</p>
<p>
  [146] Because this is a cumulative ground of appeal, in light of our conclusions 
  up to this point, it is not strictly necessary that we deal with it. However, 
  we will comment briefly as follows. </p>
<p>
  [147] We have already concluded that the Crown was entitled to advance the theory 
  that the knife found near Mr. Khan's body was planted and that the trial judge's 
  instructions to the jury adequately addressed the improper aspects of the Crown's 
  closing submissions. </p>
<p>
  [148] As for the appellant's submissions concerning the Crown's opening address, 
  we note that, at trial, immediately following the Crown's opening, defence counsel 
  raised similar objections to those being raised on appeal. The trial judge reminded 
  the jury to decide the case based solely on the evidence presented; he also 
  told them that Crown counsel "may have interpreted the evidence&#133;on 
  a few points", and that it was their interpretation that was important. 
  In our view, the trial judge's comments were sufficient to address any prejudice 
  arising from the Crown's opening address. We would not give effect to this ground 
  of appeal. </p>
<p>
  IV. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [149] For the reasons given, we would dismiss this appeal.</p>

<p><a name="a"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> We have also considered the fact that 
  the trial judge did not give the usual instruction to the jury about circumstances 
  that can provide an innocent explanation for post-offence conduct. There was 
  no objection to the charge on this ground either at trial or before this court. 
  The trial judge may have concluded that, if the jury rejected the appellant&#146;s 
  explanation for the presence of the second knife, such an instruction could 
  highlight the fact that the jury did not accept the explanation the appellant 
  gave when testifying. In the circumstances, we will not address this issue further.</p>

  deceased five times in the back from the rear, it is in this limited and most

  We now go down to 34(2), which justifies the use of deadly force. Subsection 
  34(2), everyone who is unlawfully assaulted, this is significant because you 
  do have an unlawful assault, a deemed unlawful assault by the trespasser who 
  actively resists his removal. So that seems to have been met in this case. Everyone 
  who is unlawfully assaulted, then we assume at this point that Mr. Khan is deemed 
  to have unlawfully assaulted Mr. Sheri because he actively resisted his removal 
  from Mr. Sheri's apartment. And we assume at this point Mr. Sheri has been unlawfully 
  assaulted [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  Everyone, being Mr. Sheri, the accused, who is unlawfully assaulted and who 
  causes death, it's not in dispute, or serious bodily harm, in repelling the 
  assault is justified if, and this is conjunctive both conditions here, it's 
  not disjunctive, a) he causes it under reasonable apprehension. It's not purely 
  subjective. It's a combination of objective and subjective.</p>
<p>
  Under reasonable apprehension you could substitute the word "believe", 
  under reasonable apprehension of death or serious bodily harm from the violence 
  with which the assault was originally made, that is by Mr. Khan, or with which 
  the assailant, being Mr. Khan, pursues his purpose, and, now becomes conjunctive 
  [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  Therefore, Mr. Sheri must have had reasonable apprehension of death or serious 
  bodily harm because of the violence with which the assault by Mr. Khan was originally 
  made or with which the assailant, Mr. Khan, pursued his purposes. He, being 
  the accused, believes on reasonable grounds. The word "reasonable" 
  is there again, believe is subjective, reasonable is objective, a combination 
  of the two, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from death or serious 
  bodily harm. I'll explain this again in much more detail. This is simply an 
  overview, your starting point [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  The accused has admitted that he killed Aamer Khan but maintains he did so in 
  self-defence. The first question you must resolve is whether the killing was 
  lawful or unlawful. In other words, did the accused act in lawful self-defence 
  or did he act unlawfully because self-defence is unavailable to him on the evidence 
  adduced in this case. That's the first question.</p>
<p>
  If the accused acted in self-defence he must be acquitted outright on both charges. 
  Self-defence applies in respect of murder and both forms of manslaughter.</p>
<p>
  From pp. 2078-80 of the transcript: </p>
<p>
  Section 32(2) (sic) of the Criminal Code provides as follows: everyone who is 
  unlawfully assaulted and who causes death or serious bodily harm in repelling 
  the assault, that is the unlawful assault, is justified if, (a) he causes it 
  under reasonable apprehension of death or serious bodily harm from the violence 
  with which the assault was originally made or with which the assailant pursues 
  his purpose, the assailant being Mr. Khan, and, conjunctive, (b) he, being the 
  accused believes on reasonable grounds that he cannot otherwise preserve himself 
  from death or serious bodily harm [emphasis added]. </p>
<p>
  &#133;</p>
<p>
  I turn now to general comments about section 34(2) and the use of deadly force 
  in self-defence. The starting point and first essential element of the defence 
  of self-defence is the requirement that the deceased (sic) must have a reasonable 
  belief of serious bodily harm, which may be actually attempted or threatened.</p>
<p>
  In this case, in fact, there is an evidentiary basis for a deemed assault. In 
  assessing the honesty and reasonableness of the accused's belief that he was 
  being unlawfully assaulted you must consider the accused's prior relationship 
  with the deceased and the accused's prior knowledge of the deceased's disposition 
  to act violently [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  In this case, it's the opposite. The evidence seems to be the deceased had a 
  disposition to act peacefully. Thus, the defence of self-defence permits a person 
  to kill or cause serious bodily harm to another person only as a last resort 
  for self-preservation and the limited and stringent circumstances of necessity 
  described in section 34(2) of the Criminal Code. </p>
<p>
  &#133; </p>
<p>
  Once the defence is raised, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that 
  that the defence is unavailable to the accused because the evidence supporting 
  the defence is either untrue or insufficient with respect to at least one essential 
  element of the defence.</p>
<p>
  In other words, the Crown does not have to disprove each and every essential 
  element of the defence to make the defence unavailable. Section 34(2) of the 
  Criminal Code provides that every one who is unlawfully assaulted and who causes 
  death or serious bodily harm in repelling the unlawful assault is justified 
  if he causes it under a reasonable apprehension of death or serious bodily harm 
  from the violence with which the assault was originally made or with which the 
  assailant pursues his purposes. And the accused believes on reasonable grounds 
  that he could not otherwise preserve himself from death or serious bodily harm 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  I must add that you are entitled to assess the reasonableness of the accused 
  apprehension and belief in light of his prior experience or relationship with 
  the deceased, but not in light of the accused's consumption of marijuana.</p>

  Appendix B</p>
<p>Thank you. After four weeks of evidence this case boils down to one simple 
  idea. It's the idea of stabbing someone in the back. Mr. Sheri did it to Mr. 
  Khan five times, that is what killed Mr. Khan. Now, before you were chosen as 
  jurors in this case my guess is - I may not be right - but my guess is most 
  of you probably have no previous experience with knife wounds. This was all 
  something new hearing from pathologists, that sort of talk we've heard from 
  the witness box.</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, my guess is even though you had no previous experience with 
  knife wounds all of you have already understood perfectly well what it means 
  to stab someone in the back. Probably most of you use the phrase yourself even 
  if you've never been close to an actual stabbing.</p>
<p>
  Why would you all use and understand the idea of stabbing someone in the back 
  before this case if you've never actually experienced a stabbing? Of course 
  the answer to that question is obvious, we all know it's common sense. It's 
  common usage that stabbing a person in the back is doing something mean, unexpected 
  and underhanded to that person. In fact, that's so common a use of the word 
  it's even in the dictionary, Oxford English Dictionary, edition 1989, page 7869. 
  What's a backstabber? One who attacks unfairly. Very simple idea. Very commonly 
  understood. This common sense understanding of what it means to stab someone 
  in the back teaches us a very important lesson, it's that stabbing in the back 
  is so obviously wrong and so clearly wrong we actually use that very phrase 
  as the label for all other kinds of acts that we wish to identify as wrong. 
  For example, we say things like my friend revealed a secret I asked him to keep, 
  he stabbed me in the back. My co-worker got the boss to give her a plum assignment 
  she knew I was in line first for. She stabbed me in the back.</p>
<p>
  In every day life, in your every day, common understanding stabbing someone 
  in the back is so clearly and obviously wrong it becomes the yardstick by which 
  we measure other bad acts. That is the understanding of stabbing someone in 
  the back that you as jurors bring to this case.</p>
<p>
  Now, we have to ask ourselves should the law as it's applied in this case think 
  of stabbing someone in the back any differently? That's up to you. You're the 
  judge in the case, not me, not defence counsel. I cannot tell you what to do 
  and neither can defence counsel. Nothing that was said yesterday and nothing 
  I say today is anything more than a suggestion that you are free to follow or 
  reject as you think fit. We're only lawyers, so all we can do is make suggestions. 
  That's all the rules permit us to do. You're the judges, you make the decision 
  based on what you think is right.</p>
<p>
  &#133;</p>
<p> I'd like to take you on sort of a path through the evidence and it's a path 
  that will lead us right back to where we started, right back to the idea it's 
  just plain wrong to stab someone in the back. How am I going to go through this 
  path? What I'm going to do is talk a little bit about how to analyze the evidence 
  in this case and to do that I'm going to use an analogy. I'm going to use an 
  analogy to foot prints, foot prints in the snow. And this short discussion, 
  this analogy to foot prints, will provide you with the tools you need to organize 
  the weeks of evidence you've heard in this trial [emphasis added].</p>
