<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of importing 603 grams of heroin into Canada 
  and importing a weapon (a switch blade) into Canada at the same time. He received 
  a 12 year sentence on the heroin charge and a sentence of 1 year consecutive 
  on the weapons charge. He appeals conviction and sentence.</p>
<p>The Conviction Appeal</p>
<p>[2] The heroin was allegedly found wrapped in the appellant's shoe when he 
  entered Canada. In the course of the cross-examination of the officer who allegedly 
  discovered the drugs, counsel asked the officer about the condition of one of 
  the shoes which had obviously been cut. The officer in explaining the condition 
  of the shoe, referred to something called a narcotics identification kit (N.I.K.) 
  and a test that had been performed to determine whether there was heroin in 
  the shoe. Counsel asked further questions on cross-examination about this test, 
  apparently in an attempt to show that the officer had not actually participated 
  in the test as he had indicated in his testimony. In re-examination, Crown counsel 
  was allowed to ask the officer to briefly explain the N.I.K. The officer indicated 
  that it was a field test used to "confirm a suspicion" of the presence 
  of heroin.</p>
<p>[3] At trial, the defence contended that the Crown had not proved beyond a 
  reasonable doubt that the heroin sent to the R.C.M.P. lab and analyzed had in 
  fact come from the appellant's shoe. This was the central issue at trial. The 
  defence challenged the credibility of the investigating officer P.C. Armstrong, 
  relying on his preliminary inquiry testimony, which was significantly different 
  from the evidence he gave at trial concerning the colour of the shoes from which 
  he had taken the heroin. This officer offered an explanation for that inconsistency. 
  This officer had nothing to do with the N.I.K. test.</p>
<p>[4] We see no error in the admission of the evidence concerning the N.I.K. 
  test. In our view, it flowed naturally from counsel for the appellant's questions 
  about the condition of the shoe. We also think it was appropriate that the Crown 
  be allowed to offer some explanation as to what this test was and we see nothing 
  inherently prejudicial in the explanation offered on re-examination. </p>
<p>[5] It is clear that the evidence concerning the N.I.K. test could not assist 
  the Crown in establishing that the cocaine tested at the lab came from the appellant's 
  shoe and could not be used by the Crown to prove that the appellant was in possession 
  of cocaine. After anxious consideration, we are satisfied that the trial judge 
  did make it clear to the jury that the N.I.K. test results could not assist 
  them in determining the crucial issue at trial. We rely on two passages from 
  her instructions:</p>
<p class="indent">As well, Constable Tangney did what is called a N.I.K. test, 
  which revealed the substance to be heroin. I should say that Constable Tangney 
  took part in a N.I.K. test and the whitish powder tested positive for heroin. 
  The evidence concerning the N.I.K., members of the jury, is not irrelevant, 
  but I need to inform you that the N.I.K. test is a superficial screening device. 
  Its results do not establish that the whitish powder is heroin. You must look 
  to the two certificates of analysis and the chain of continuity, if accepted 
  by you, as set out in Constable Armstrong's evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, it is my view you should have no difficulty in 
  concluding that the substances analyzed is heroin. The onus remains on the Crown 
  to prove this fact beyond a reasonable doubt as the Crown is required to prove 
  that the chain of continuity, starting with the shoes, the black shoes continue 
  to this court and that what is before you is what was contained in the black 
  shoes. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>[6] Based on these instructions, we are satisfied that the jury would not have 
  used the N.I.K. results in resolving the crucial question of continuity. Their 
  verdict indicates that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
  Crown had established the necessary continuity. The conviction appeal is dismissed. 
</p>
<p>The Sentence Appeal</p>
<p>[7] We agree with counsel's submission that the trial judge should not have 
  considered the possession of the weapon as an aggravating factor on the charge 
  of importing heroin and then gone on to impose a consecutive sentence on the 
  charge relating to the possession of the weapon. In our view, while a consecutive 
  sentence for the weapons charge may have been appropriate given that Parliament 
  has set a mandatory minimum penalty for the offence, a consecutive sentence 
  combined with reference to the possession as an aggravating factor on the importing 
  charge was not appropriate. The easiest way to correct this error at this point 
  in time is to make the sentence on the weapons charge concurrent resulting in 
  a total sentence of 12 years. The appeal from sentence is allowed. The 1 year 
  consecutive sentence on the weapons charge is made concurrent to the 12 year 
  sentence on the importing charge.</p>
