<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted on August 13, 1999 of one count of fraud over 
  $5,000, contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, in respect of alleged 
  welfare fraud during the period March 1991 to March 1996. He received a twelve 
  month conditional sentence, to be served in the community. He was also ordered 
  to make restitution in the sum of $37,588. He appeals his conviction and his 
  sentence.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant pleaded guilty at trial. He was represented at trial by a 
  lawyer retained on his behalf by his mother. The appellant argues on his conviction 
  appeal that his plea was entered under duress, that he received ineffective 
  legal assistance from his lawyer, and that his lawyer had a conflict of interest 
  by reason of his retainer by the appellant's mother. We would not give effect 
  to these grounds of appeal, for the following reasons.</p>
<p>
  [3] First, when the appellant pleaded guilty, the facts in support of his plea 
  were read into the record by Crown counsel. The appellant, through his lawyer, 
  accepted those facts as substantially correct. The appellant did not object 
  to the facts read-in, or otherwise suggest that they were inaccurate, at any 
  point during his trial. </p>
<p>
  [4] By his admission of those facts, the appellant acknowledged that he had 
  other sources of income while receiving general welfare benefits. He did not 
  disclose these other sources of income when he signed and submitted numerous 
  monthly income declarations to the welfare authorities. These declarations, 
  the completion of which was required as a condition of the appellant's continued 
  receipt of welfare benefits, specifically identified veteran's allowance and 
  Canada Pension Plan benefits as sources of income to be reported to the welfare 
  authorities. The appellant did not do so.</p>
<p>
  [5] Second, although the appellant submits on this appeal that he did not receive 
  Canada Pension Plan benefits prior to 1995 or 1996, the record before this court 
  indicates that he received, at least, veteran's allowance benefits in the total 
  amount of $39,297.86 during the period in question.</p>
<p>
  [6] Third, while the appellant challenges the competency of his former trial 
  counsel and alleges that he had a conflict of interest, there is no evidence 
  before this court that supports that assertion. In addition, his former lawyer 
  swore an affidavit in this proceeding, which was not challenged by the appellant, 
  in which, contrary to the appellant's submissions, he swore that he reviewed 
  the relevant facts with the appellant prior to the appellant entering his guilty 
  plea, that the appellant provided proper instructions concerning the plea, and 
  that the appellant was not pressured into entering a plea of guilty.</p>
<p>
  [7] In all these circumstances, the conviction appeal must fail.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant has not advanced any specific grounds of appeal in support 
  of his sentence appeal. We note, however, that his sentence was the result of 
  a joint submission at trial by Crown counsel and the appellant's lawyer that 
  was accepted by the trial judge. In our view, the trial judge did not err in 
  accepting the joint submission and the sentence was fit.</p>
<p>
  [9] Accordingly, for the reasons given, the appeal against conviction is dismissed, 
  leave to appeal sentence is granted and the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
