<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Counsel for the appellant raises one basic issue on this appeal. He challenges 
  the finding by the motions judge that the sale of the respondent's interest 
  in the business was not "bogus", but an arm's length transaction with 
  a price that took into account the respondent's lack of productivity in the 
  business for a considerable period of time. He fairly acknowledges that this 
  is a finding of fact. It is therefore necessary that it constitute palpable 
  and overriding error.</p>
<p>
  [2] In our view, he cannot meet that high standard. There was ample evidence 
  from Mr. Pettinella to support the finding. The motions judge demonstrated in 
  her reasons that she was alive to and considered the evidence of the history 
  of the company, the respondent's role in it and the respondent's conduct in 
  relation to his legal obligations. She concluded that the sale was not bogus, 
  but an arm's length transaction. It is not our role to retry that conclusion 
  of fact. Absent palpable and overriding error it must stand.</p>
<p>
  [3] Given this finding it was entirely open to the motions judge to impute income 
  to the respondent for 2002 in the amount she did.</p>
<p>
  [4] As to the retroactivity of her order, counsel for the respondent fairly 
  concedes that there is no reason to depart from the usual earliest commencement 
  date of such an order, namely the date of the application to vary. We would 
  therefore alter the order below to that effect. </p>
<p>
  [5] Apart from this amendment the appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [6] Given the respondent's pattern of conduct and his significant arrears in 
  payments, this is not a case for costs.</p>
