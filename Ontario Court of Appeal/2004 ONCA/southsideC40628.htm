<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The narrow issue in this appeal from a judgment of Morissette J. is whether 
  the appellant had status to bring an application for various forms of relief, 
  including a declaration and specific performance of an agreement entered into 
  between "Southside Group in Trust for a Company to be formed" and 
  the respondent the Estate of Boris Julian Sibold. Morissette J. made her decision 
  as a result of a motion brought by the appellant Southside Property Management 
  (London) Inc. for an order directing the Registrar to issue a Certificate of 
  Pending Litigation. She refused to grant the relief requested and, instead, 
  dismissed the application on the basis that the appellant did not have status 
  to bring the application. For the following reasons, we agree with her conclusion 
  and therefore would dismiss the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [2] To understand the appellant's argument it is necessary to briefly set out 
  the chronology of events. This litigation concerns a piece of property in Stratford 
  that was owned by the Estate. The offer to purchase the property was submitted 
  on May 1, 2003. As indicated, the purchaser purported to be "Southside 
  Group in Trust for a Company to be formed". The offer is signed by Mr. 
  Frijia and was to expire on May 8th. On May 7th, Mr. Frijia signed a letter 
  stating that the offer was open for acceptance until May 12th. In the letter, 
  Mr. Frijia states: </p>
<p class="indent"> I have authority</p>
<p class="indent">Southside Group in Trust for a</p>
<p class="indent">Company to be Incorporated</p>
<p>
  [3] The offer to purchase was subject to a first right of refusal held by the 
  lessee, the respondent Gary Stockie Chevrolet Geo Oldsmobile Cadillac Limited. 
  On May 12th, the Estate made a counter-offer to Southside Group. Southside Group 
  purported to accept the offer on the same day. On May 16th, Gary Stockie Chevrolet 
  exercised its right of first refusal. In July, Mr. Frijia apparently discovered 
  that Gary Stockie Chevrolet had not complied with certain terms and conditions 
  required to purchase the property. This led to the Notice of Motion dated July 
  10, 2003 requesting a certificate of pending litigation. The motion was originally 
  returnable July 15th. The appellant commenced its application on July 17, 2003. 
  At that time, it had no legal interest in the property.</p>
<p>
  [4] "Southside Group" is a name used by Mr. Frijia. It is not a legal 
  entity and Mr. Frijia has not registered that name. By using that name to carry 
  on business, therefore, Mr. Frijia is in violation of s. 2(2) of the Business 
  Names Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.17. Under s. 7(1) of that Act, a person carrying 
  on business in contravention of, inter alia, s. 2(2) "is not capable of 
  maintaining a proceeding in a court in Ontario in connection with that business 
  except with leave of the court". Mr. Frijia has never sought leave of the 
  court nor has he attempted to comply with the Act by registering "Southside 
  Group".</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant is one of Mr. Frijia's companies. It is a legal entity, but 
  was incorporated prior to the agreement of purchase and sale that is the subject 
  of this litigation. It is, in other words, not "a Company to be formed" 
  as contemplated by the agreement or as contemplated by s. 21(1) of the Business 
  Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.17. Nor has the appellant purported to adopt 
  the agreement as provided in s. 21(2) of the Business Corporations Act.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant attempts to avoid the effects of the Business Names Act and 
  the Business Corporations Act and the fact that it had no interest in the property 
  when it launched the motion and application by the following device. On August 
  19, 2003, a few days before the return date of the motion, Mr. Frijia purported 
  to assign his interest in the agreement to the appellant. In an affidavit, apparently 
  signed on August 20, 2003, Mr. Frijia states that the beneficiary of the Trust 
  for a company to be formed is the appellant, notwithstanding that the appellant 
  was a pre-existing company.</p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant's case rests on the theory that Mr. Frijia had an interest 
  in the property that he was entitled to assign to the appellant, and that it 
  was irrelevant that at the time the application was launched the appellant had 
  no interest in the property. The motions judge held that Mr. Frijia had no entitlement 
  to the benefits of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale and therefore had nothing 
  to assign. The appellant submits that the motion judge erred in failing to consider 
  the intentions of the parties to the agreement. </p>
<p>
  [8] In our view, the motions judge correctly applied the legislation as the 
  application was framed before her. Section 21 of the Business Corporations Act 
  was designed to overcome the confusing state of the common law pertaining to 
  pre-incorporation contracts and to avoid the need to determine the intention 
  of the parties. See Szecket v. Huang (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 400 (C.A.) at 411. 
  Under s. 21 a person who enters into a contract in the name of a corporation 
  before it comes into existence "is personally bound by the contract and 
  is entitled to the benefits thereof". Had it been a legal entity, Southside 
  Group could have taken the benefit of the contract and perhaps assigned its 
  interest to another entity. But it was not a legal entity and because he was 
  in violation of the Business Names Act and had not sought leave, it was not 
  open to Mr. Frijia to take the benefits of the contract and bring an action 
  in court. In our view, he cannot avoid the express effect of this legislation 
  by the device of purporting to assign his interest, well after the application 
  was launched. </p>
<p>
  [9] There is a further defect in the proceedings. Under rule 5.03, Mr. Frijia 
  as the assignor should have been joined in the application.</p>
<p>
  [10] We cannot say that in these circumstances the motions judge was wrong to 
  dismiss the application rather than give Mr. Frijia and the appellant an opportunity 
  to regularize matters by complying with the Rules and the Business Names Act. 
  As we read the record, she was not asked to do so and Mr. Frijia has never sought 
  leave under s. 7 of the Act. Nothing in these reasons should be taken as foreclosing 
  the possibility that it may be possible for Mr. Frijia or some entity with an 
  interest in the agreement to launch a properly constituted application.</p>
<p>
  [11] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed as follows. The appellant 
  will pay $4,000 in costs inclusive of disbursements and GST to Gary Stockie 
  Chevrolet and $5,500 in costs inclusive of disbursements and GST to the Estate.</p>
