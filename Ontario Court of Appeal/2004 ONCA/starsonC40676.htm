<p>On appeal from the disposition of the Ontario Review Board made on August 28, 
  2003.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  ROSENBERG J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant appeals from the disposition of the Ontario Review Board on 
  August 28, 2003 that he continue to be detained at the medium secure unit of 
  the Royal Ottawa Health Care Group. The appellant submits that the findings 
  of the Board, that he represents a significant threat to the safety of the public 
  and that the least restrictive and onerous disposition is to continue his detention 
  at the Royal Ottawa Hospital, are unreasonable. Ms. Szigeti, amicus curiae, 
  raises an additional ground concerning the fairness of the process before the 
  Board. For the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  THE FACTS</p>
<p>
  [2] On November 24, 1998, the appellant was found not criminally responsible 
  on account of mental disorder on two counts of threatening. He has been detained 
  in a hospital since that time. Prior to the hearing that resulted in the August 
  28, 2003 disposition, the appellant was held on the basis of a disposition made 
  October 10, 2002. Pursuant to that disposition, it was ordered that the appellant 
  continue to be detained but that he be transferred from the maximum security 
  Oak Ridge Division of the Mental Health Centre, Penetanguishene to a medium 
  secure unit of the Royal Ottawa Health Care Group. At that time, the Board pointed 
  out the difficulty in dealing with the appellant's case. They concluded their 
  reasons for the October 10, 2002 disposition with the following statement: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Board can't accept that the system outlined in Part XX.I 
  of the Criminal Code is serving Professor Starson as it is intended to, or in 
  any event, very well. Given the words of the Chief Justice [in Winko v. British 
  Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute) infra], it would not appear that the 
  system has any room in which to deal with persons who are treatment resistant 
  either because of the nature of their disorder or the absence of consent.&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Professor Starson's current position can be described as one 
  in which he is standing within the system with his rights in his hand.</p>
<p class="indent">The Board concludes that the accused remains a significant threat 
  to the safety of the public by reason of mental disorder and, accordingly, pursuant 
  to the provisions of section 672.54, after considering the factors therein outlined, 
  that the least onerous and least restrictive disposition is that Professor Starson 
  be detained. It is the Board's further conclusion that an appropriate condition 
  to be attached to that detainment is that he be detained at the Royal Ottawa 
  Health Care Group, Ottawa, Ontario, until the further disposition of the Board. 
  It is the intention of the Board to conduct an annual review hearing within 
  a period of seven months from the date upon which the accused is transferred 
  to the Royal Ottawa Health Care Group. The Board also concludes that it is appropriate 
  that during his detainment at the Royal Ottawa Health Care Group, that Professor 
  Starson come under the direct supervision of Dr. John Bradford and that Dr. 
  John Bradford advise the Board of his assessment of the condition of Professor 
  Starson within three months of the date upon which he is admitted to the Royal 
  Ottawa Health Care Group.</p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant's interaction with the criminal justice system began with 
  the formal onset of his mental disorder in approximately 1985. Since that time 
  he has been convicted on numerous occasions. With few exceptions, the convictions 
  are for uttering threats or making harassing telephone calls. Since 1985, he 
  has been admitted to a number of hospitals in Canada and the United States. 
  There have been a number of psychiatric diagnoses for his condition. Until recently, 
  the operating diagnosis was bipolar affective disorder. The current diagnosis 
  is schizoaffective disorder. In the most recent Reasons for Disposition of the 
  Board, his psychiatric history is described as consisting of "poor insight, 
  medication non-compliance, and a tendency to become belligerent, aggressive, 
  and threatening, in instances where his wishes were not met or his will thwarted". 
  When he was initially found not criminally responsible he was detained at the 
  Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. Following a number of threats 
  to staff, he was transferred to Penetanguishene. He was transferred to the Royal 
  Ottawa Hospital on March 26, 2003 in accordance with the October 2002 disposition.</p>
<p>
  [4] A special issue with this appellant is his refusal to take treatment. In 
  December 1998, he was declared incompetent to consent to treatment. That matter 
  was reviewed by the Consent and Capacity Board and eventually by the courts 
  resulting in the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Starson v. Swayze, 
  [2003] 1 S.C.R. 722. The Supreme Court upheld the decision of Molloy J. of the 
  Superior Court of Justice and of this court that the appellant was capable of 
  consenting (or refusing to consent) to treatment. The decision of the Supreme 
  Court was released in June of 2003. In April 2003, Dr. John Bradford, the appellant's 
  attending psychiatrist, had evaluated the appellant and declared him incapable. 
  While Dr. Bradford's testimony at the hearing was less than clear on this point, 
  it would seem that he accepts the subsequent decision of the Supreme Court of 
  Canada, as there has been no further attempt to treat the appellant, who continues 
  to refuse treatment for his mental disorder. </p>
<p>
  [5] Despite the lack of treatment, since his transfer to the Royal Ottawa Hospital 
  the appellant's condition seems to have improved. Dr. Bradford attributes the 
  apparent improvement to the less structured setting of the Royal Ottawa Hospital. 
  Dr. Bradford testified that the appellant would be threatening and intimidating 
  when there was any talk of restrictions, such as when there were restrictions 
  placed on telephone calls or when Dr. Bradford turned down the appellant's request 
  for medical marijuana. However, Dr. Bradford testified that in the short time 
  before the Board hearing, the appellant had engaged in minimal threatening or 
  intimidating behaviour because the staff had left the appellant alone as much 
  as possible.</p>
<p> [6] Dr. Bradford would have a number of concerns if the appellant were to 
  be placed in the community: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The type of major mental illness that the appellant suffers is associated 
    with a significantly higher risk of physical violence than the general population;</li>
  <li>If released into the community, the appellant would be able to access marijuana, 
    the use of which increases the risk of physical violence for persons suffering 
    from this type of illness; and</li>
  <li>The appellant is driven by his delusional beliefs that allow him to feel 
    empowered to order things, order people around and have his demands met; if 
    people were to stand in his way, he would become threatening and intimidating.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [7] The Board's conclusions are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Board has carefully considered all of the information presented, 
  viva voce and documentary, in Starson's case. Starson suffers from a serious 
  ongoing major mental disorder, namely schizoaffective disorder. The onset of 
  that illness is coincidental with a number of encounters Starson has had with 
  the criminal justice system; and the preponderance of these encounters involves 
  serious threats made by Starson, which were not just off-putting or of a nuisance 
  nature. Those threats have continued until recent times, albeit they are reportedly 
  of lesser severity over the last number of months Starson has been a resident 
  of the Royal Ottawa Hospital.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bradford's review of Starson's risk makes clear that he 
  is at substantial risk for threatening and aggressive behaviour, both within 
  the hospital and in the community, if strict controls are not kept in place.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on all the evidence made available to the Board, it has 
  no difficulty arriving at an affirmative view that Starson continues to represent 
  a significant threat to the safety of the public, and it does so unanimously.</p>
<p class="indent">The Board concludes that the least restrictive and onerous Disposition 
  is to continue Starson's current order with the proviso that he be allowed staff 
  accompanied access to the community, and directly supervised access to the hospital 
  and its grounds. The Board anticipates that greater access to the hospital and 
  its grounds will be afforded to Starson if indeed he is transferred to the parallel 
  secure (medium) unit at the Brockville branch of the Royal Ottawa Health Care 
  Group. Notably, Starson was agreeable to that approach.</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  The Procedural Issue</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant's hearing before the Ontario Review Board was originally scheduled 
  for July 4, 2003. At that time, the appellant was not represented by counsel 
  and did not want counsel. The Board observed that he was "clearly very 
  ill" and that "[h]e was unable to remain focused on the issue before 
  the board and was rambling and irrational in his submissions." Accordingly, 
  the Board appointed counsel for the appellant, exercising its power under s. 
  672.5(8)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, and adjourned the hearing 
  to August 20, 2003.</p>
<p>
  [9] On August 20, 2003, Mr. M. Davies appeared as appointed counsel for the 
  appellant. The appellant did not want Mr. Davies, or any lawyer, to act for 
  him. It was apparent that the appellant's condition had improved since July 
  4th. It was his view that he needed to act for himself so that the truth would 
  come out. He was, however, agreeable to have Mr. Davies act as amicus curiae, 
  as were all the other parties. The Board adopted this procedure.</p>
<p>
  [10] Before this court, Ms. Szigeti raised the question of the Board's power 
  to appoint amicus curiae. She also submitted that the appointment of amicus 
  contributed to an unfair proceeding. I do not intend to address the first question; 
  the issue was not raised by the appellant in this court, and the Board adopted 
  the procedure it did with the consent of all parties and in an effort to ensure 
  that the appellant had a fair hearing while respecting his wishes to represent 
  himself. More importantly, I am satisfied that the appellant did have a fair 
  hearing and that the appellant's rights were not impaired because of the presence 
  and intervention of amicus before the Board.</p>
<p>
  [11] On the question of fairness of the process, Ms. Szigeti's main concern 
  was that because of the interplay between the appellant and Mr. Davies, important 
  issues were not properly probed. In discussing the role of amicus in questioning 
  Dr. Bradford, the Chairperson told counsel: </p>
<p class="indent">
  But in the circumstances and given the informality of our process and also given 
  what's at stake over here, we'll in the circumstance allow you to ask questions 
  bearing in mind Mr. Dzioba's [Crown counsel] caution around that. It wouldn't 
  be in anyone's interest to have you simply revisit areas that Professor Starson 
  has already explored with Dr. Bradford.</p>
<p>
  [12] In my view, this direction did not prevent Mr. Davies from raising important 
  issues in the proceedings and did not prevent him from cross-examining Dr. Bradford 
  on matters that had not been adequately explored by the appellant in his questioning. 
  Thus, while the Chairperson asked counsel to bear in mind Crown counsel's "caution", 
  Crown counsel had made it clear that he felt it was the role of amicus to raise 
  those issues that in the Board's opinion were relevant and "which ought 
  to be perhaps either explored or more fully elaborated". In the result, 
  Professor Starson's cross-examination of Dr. Bradford covers sixteen pages of 
  the transcript. Mr. Davies' cross-examination covers thirty pages. The cross-examination 
  canvassed the important issues before the Board, including the basis for Dr. 
  Bradford's opinion that persons with the appellant's illness are at a greater 
  risk to commit acts of violence; the relationship between cannabis use and violence 
  in persons with this disorder; the circumstances under which the appellant was 
  being detained; the fact that he had not had to be physically restrained since 
  coming to the Royal Ottawa Hospital; the fact that there had been a change in 
  his behaviour since coming to the Hospital; the fact that he had responded appropriately 
  to Dr. Bradford; the question of treatment and the impact of the decision of 
  the Supreme Court of Canada; the progress of the disorder; and the options for 
  greater privileges, including making different arrangements at the Brockville 
  campus of the Royal Ottawa Hospital.</p>
<p>
  [13] After the questioning by amicus, members of the Board asked Dr. Bradford 
  a number of questions, particularly directed to the issue of risk to the safety 
  of the public and the appellant's behaviour in the hospital.</p>
<p>
  [14] The role of the Board was described by the Supreme Court in Winko v. British 
  Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625 at para. 62: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The proceeding before the court or Review Board is not adversarial. If the parties 
  do not present sufficient information, it is up to the court or Review Board 
  to seek out the evidence it requires to make its decision.</p>
<p>
  [15] In my view, with the assistance of amicus curiae, the Board fulfilled its 
  duty to ensure that it had the evidence necessary to make its decision. Ms. 
  Szigeti suggested that there was not sufficient probing of Dr. Bradford's testimony 
  that the appellant was threatening and intimidating. That is not my view of 
  the proceedings. That issue was dealt with by the appellant in his questioning 
  and by Mr. Davies. By the end of the hearing, there could have been no doubt 
  that whatever had been the case in the past, most recently the appellant's behaviour 
  had improved so that as Dr. Bradford put it, "any kind of threats or intimidating 
  behaviour has been very low key if not at all". The critical question, 
  however, was the reason for this change. Mr. Davies and the Board examined Dr. 
  Bradford on this issue. That examination established that the reason for the 
  change was not due to any change in the progress of the appellant's illness 
  but a consequence of a "hands-off" approach by Dr. Bradford and the 
  Royal Ottawa Hospital staff.</p>
<p> [16] Ms. Szigeti pointed out that at the opening of the appellant's cross-examination 
  of Dr. Bradford, the appellant stated that had he known Mr. Davies was going 
  to be amicus curiae, he "would have a lot of this more prepared". A dialogue 
  then ensued between the appellant and the Chairperson about the use that could 
  be made of Molloy J.'s reasons in Starson v. Swayze, reported at [1999] O.J. 
  No. 4483.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> The Chairperson pointed out to 
  the appellant that he would have an opportunity to present evidence later but 
  this was his opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Bradford. He was also told that 
  he could offer the reasons later. The appellant understood and questioned Dr. 
  Bradford. The appellant did testify later but did not attempt to present Molloy 
  J.'s reasons or any of the other material from that hearing.</p>
<p>
  [17] In my view, it has not been shown that the change in status of Mr. Davies 
  from appointed counsel to amicus affected the appellant's ability to present 
  evidence. It must be remembered that it was the appellant who precipitated the 
  change because he did not want counsel. At that point, the alternatives were 
  to force counsel on the appellant or simply permit Mr. Davies to withdraw. The 
  former was contrary to what the appellant wanted. There is nothing to indicate 
  that the appellant was incapable of making the choice not to have counsel. If 
  Mr. Davies simply withdrew, the appellant would be in no better position than 
  he was with amicus. To the contrary, the presence of amicus assisted in exploring 
  the relevant issues.</p>
<p>
  [18] Finally, Ms. Szigeti points out that during the appellant's testimony, 
  he indicated that he wanted to call witnesses, apparently by teleconference. 
  For example, the appellant had wanted to call one witness, Dennis Douse, who 
  had been a friend for thirty years. There was no indication, however, that this 
  or any other witness had any relevant evidence to give. The appellant also stated 
  that he wanted to refer to papers he had written. Again, there was nothing to 
  show that this material would have been relevant to the Board's determination. 
  No attempt was made in this court to adduce fresh evidence.</p>
<p>
  [19] I am satisfied that the appellant had a fair hearing before the Board and 
  that the participation by amicus curiae contributed to that process.</p>
<p>
  Dangerousness</p>
<p>
  [20] The appellant's principal submission on the appeal was that the Board erred 
  in finding that he continues to pose a significant threat to the safety of the 
  public. Before examining this issue, it is necessary to note the standard of 
  review on an appeal from a disposition by the Ontario Review Board. The Supreme 
  Court of Canada most recently addressed that question in R. v. Owen, [2003] 
  1 S.C.R. 779. Absent an error in law or an allegation of a miscarriage of justice, 
  the standard of review of the decision is reasonableness simpliciter. The Court 
  described that standard at para. 33: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The first branch of the test corresponds with what the courts call the standard 
  of review of reasonableness simpliciter, i.e., the Court of Appeal should ask 
  itself whether the Board's risk assessment and disposition order was unreasonable 
  in the sense of not being supported by reasons that can bear even a somewhat 
  probing examination&#133;. If the Board's decision is such that it could reasonably 
  be the subject of disagreement among Board members properly informed of the 
  facts and instructed on the applicable law, the court should in general decline 
  to intervene.</p>
<p>
  [21] In my view, the Board's risk assessment is not unreasonable. I have set 
  out the Board's reasons for its determination above. In summary, they accepted 
  Dr. Bradford's opinion that without strict controls, the appellant would represent 
  a significant threat to the safety of the public. The Board extensively and 
  accurately reviewed Dr. Bradford's testimony and his report. The appellant submits 
  that the facts are that there have been no threats recently and that he has 
  never physically injured anyone. The Board was well aware of this. For example, 
  the Board accurately summarized the evidence, in part, as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Dr. Bradford is of the clear view that Starson continues to 
  represent a significant threat to the safety of the public. Although Starson 
  has not demonstrated any physical aggression over the course of his stay at 
  the Royal Ottawa Hospital, he has acted in a psychologically abusive and threatening 
  manner. Notably, Starson's history is replete with examples of him making severe 
  threats that have no doubt been associated with a substantial risk of psychological 
  harm to the victim of that threat.</p>
<p class="indent">Dr. Bradford, in his oral testimony, acknowledged some measure 
  of behavioural improvement on Starson's part. Although he remains actively psychotic 
  and evidently harbours the same delusional belief system as he has in the past, 
  there has been no effort on Starson's part to act out any of his delusions, 
  nor does he seem to be as affectively charged in relation to those beliefs as 
  he had been in the past.</p>
<p>
  [22] It was open to the Board to accept that since the appellant suffers from 
  a major mental illness that had not been treated, the explanation for the recent 
  improvement in the appellant's behaviour was the hands-off approach at the Royal 
  Ottawa Hospital. Accordingly, it was reasonable to conclude that if the appellant 
  was not kept closely confined and monitored, he would return to his threatening 
  and intimidating behaviour. It seems inevitable, given the nature of the appellant's 
  disorder, that if the appellant were to come into contact with other persons 
  who would not accede to his unreasonable demands, he would return to his prior 
  behaviour.</p>
<p>
  [23] Finally, it must be remembered that harm to society includes psychological 
  harm. As was said in Winko, at para. 62: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A "significant threat to the safety of the public" means a real risk 
  of physical or psychological harm to members of the public that is serious in 
  the sense of going beyond the merely trivial or annoying. The conduct giving 
  rise to the harm must be criminal in nature.</p>
<p>
  [24] Thus, the fact that, to date, the appellant has never physically harmed 
  anyone does not render the Board's decision unreasonable. There was a body of 
  evidence to support a finding that the appellant continued to represent a real 
  risk of serious psychological harm to members of the public by his threatening 
  behaviour, which in the past has included threats of death. As the Court held 
  in Winko, at para. 61: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Appellate courts reviewing the dispositions made by a court or Review Board 
  should bear in mind the broad range of these inquiries, the familiarity with 
  the situation of the specific NCR accused that the lower tribunals possess, 
  and the difficulty of assessing whether a given individual poses a "significant 
  threat" to public safety.</p>
<p>
  [25] I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  Least Onerous</p>
<p>
  [26] The appellant submits that even if this court were to uphold the Board's 
  decision that he poses a significant threat to public safety, his continued 
  detention in the hospital is not the least onerous order. McLachlin J. summarized 
  the Board's role at para. 62 of Winko: </p>
<p class="indent"> If the court or Review Board concludes that the NCR accused 
  is a significant threat to the safety of the public, it has two alternatives. 
  It may order that the NCR accused be discharged subject to the conditions the 
  court or Review Board considers necessary, or it may direct that the NCR accused 
  be detained in custody in a hospital, again subject to appropriate conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">When deciding whether to make an order for a conditional discharge 
  or for detention in a hospital, the court or Review Board must again consider 
  the need to protect the public from dangerous persons, the mental condition 
  of the NCR accused, the reintegration of the NCR accused into society, and the 
  other needs of the NCR accused, and make the order that is the least onerous 
  and least restrictive to the NCR accused.</p>
<p>
  [27] At the hearing, the appellant presented a plan, of sorts, for his discharge 
  from hospital on conditions. In answer to questions from amicus, the appellant 
  stated that he would find a residence in Toronto and be an outpatient at the 
  Queen Street and work with an unnamed psychiatrist with whom he has a rapport 
  and who would not force him to accept treatment with drugs. He also stated that 
  he would be willing to report by telephone every four hours.</p>
<p>
  [28] Dr. Bradford indicated that the Hospital would be agreeable to transferring 
  the appellant to another medium secure facility in the Royal Ottawa Health Care 
  Group, the Brockville campus, so that the appellant could have greater access 
  to the community. The appellant agreed that this would be fairer to him, and 
  stated that he would be willing to cooperate so that he could slowly move back 
  to the community.</p>
<p>
  [29] As Dr. Bradford pointed out, the appellant had only recently been transferred 
  to a medium security institution from the maximum security facility at Penetanguishene. 
  He saw the next logical step as permitting the appellant to have greater supervised 
  access to the community: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [Y]ou've got somebody whose come from maximum security where they've been contained 
  in a period of time, come to a medium security where I think that there has 
  been a lessening of tension over some period of time and I've explained why 
  because of the unstructured approach. Is that positive? Yes, I think it is. 
  There's been no isolation rooms, no chemical restraint but progress is very, 
  very slow. And you know, other things have occurred. So yes, I mean for me, 
  the next logical step would be - I mean the whole thing is geared towards establishing 
  better rapport with Starson and hopefully, out of that treatment progress would 
  be made. And I think that that's something which you know, we'll continue to 
  work on. And at this moment in time, given his mental status, the only thing 
  that I can see in the foreseeable future is direct supervision off the unit.</p>
<p>
  [30] The Board addressed the issue of least restrictive and onerous disposition. 
  It concluded that the appellant's continued detention in hospital, with the 
  proviso that he be allowed staff-accompanied access to the community and directly 
  supervised access to the hospital and its grounds, was the least restrictive 
  disposition possible. The Board also anticipated that this greater access would 
  be afforded to the appellant if he were transferred to the Brockville campus.</p>
<p>
  [31] I cannot say that the Board's disposition was unreasonable bearing in mind 
  the factors it had to consider, namely, the appellant's reintegration into society, 
  his mental status and his needs. As was said in Owen at para. 45, "the 
  Board's decision was within a reasonable range of outcomes". I would not 
  give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [32] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. I wish to thank counsel for their 
  assistance in this appeal and especially Ms. Szigeti who acted as amicus curiae.</p>
