<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Ellen Macdonald of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated September 23, 2002, reported at [2002] O.J. No. 1008 and [2002] 
  O.J. No. 3656.</p>
<p>
  CRONK J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This action arose out of a dispute regarding the extent of a lessee's liability 
  under its covenants to restore and repair a leased industrial building during 
  the term and upon the termination of a ten-year commercial lease. The trial 
  involved the assessment of damages only, liability having been admitted by the 
  lessee. The issues in these proceedings concern the application of a discount 
  for the 'betterment' of the leased premises to various heads of damages claimed 
  by the lessor and the trial judge's approach to awarding interest and costs 
  to the lessor at trial. As explained later in these reasons, the term 'betterment', 
  as used by the parties and the trial judge in this case, refers to 'reasonable 
  wear and tear' exceptions in the lease.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant (the "lessor") claims that the trial judge erred: 
  (a) in applying a 35% 'betterment' discount (the "Betterment Discount") 
  to the damages awarded for the cost and management of restoring and repairing 
  the leased premises; and (b) in declining to award pre-judgment interest for 
  the three-month period that the trial judge found would be required to carry 
  out the requisite restorations and repairs.</p>
<p>
  [3] The respondents (the "lessees") argue on their cross-appeal that 
  the trial judge erred: (a) in awarding the lessor damages on account of lost 
  rents or, in the alternative, in failing to apply the Betterment Discount to 
  these damages; (b) in failing to limit the rate of interest awarded to the lessor 
  to the applicable rate prescribed by the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. C.43 (the "CJA"), except in respect of damages awarded for actual 
  repair expenditures made by the lessor; and (c) in her approach to awarding 
  costs to the lessor. </p>
<p>
  [4] For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the application of the 35% 
  Betterment Discount is unsupportable on the evidentiary record in this case. 
  I am also of the view that the trial judge erred in fixing the rate of pre- 
  and post- judgment interest awarded to Stellarbridge and, in part, in her approach 
  to awarding the costs of the action to Stellarbridge. Accordingly, I would allow 
  the appeal and cross-appeal, in part, to conform with these reasons and would 
  dismiss the balance of both the appeal and cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  I. BACKGROUND </p>
<p>
  [5] On March 1, 1999, the lessor, Stellarbridge Management Inc. (Stellarbridge) 
  entered into a written lease (the "Lease") with the lessee, Magna 
  International (Canada) Inc. ("Magna"). Under the Lease, Magna agreed 
  to lease a new industrial building located in the Town of Vaughan for a period 
  of ten years, commencing March 1, 1989 and ending February 28, 1999. The Lease 
  contained an option to renew for an additional five years.</p>
<p>
  [6] Stellarbridge designed and constructed the leased premises in accordance 
  with specifications set by Magna and one of its related companies, Trans Automated 
  Equipment ("TAE"). As constructed, the leased premises comprised 80,000 
  square feet, of which 30,000 square feet consisted of office space and the balance 
  was designed for various industrial manufacturing operations.</p>
<p>
  [7] The lessee covenanted under the Lease to repair and maintain the leased 
  premises during the term of the Lease, subject to reasonable wear and tear; 
  to surrender the premises at the end of the Lease "in a good state of repair 
  and maintenance", subject to "the exceptions herein provided"; 
  and to restore the interior of the leased premises "to its former condition" 
  immediately prior to the installation of fixtures, alterations or changes to 
  the interior, reasonable wear and tear excepted. </p>
<p>
  [8] Stellarbridge delivered possession of the leased premises to TAE at the 
  outset of the Lease. Thereafter, and with Stellarbridge's knowledge, the premises 
  were occupied by TAE and, from time to time, by several other Magna-related 
  companies. </p>
<p>
  [9] On July 10, 1991, Magna assigned its interest under the Lease to Tesma International 
  Inc. (Tesma), a Magna-related company. In December 1998, Tesma notified Stellarbridge 
  that it did not intend to renew the Lease upon the expiry of its term.</p>
<p>
  [10] When Stellarbridge learned that Tesma intended to vacate the leased premises, 
  the parties entered into discussions regarding the scope of the lessee's obligations 
  to restore and repair the premises. These discussions failed to produce an agreement 
  on the nature of the required work and Stellarbridge retained consulting engineers, 
  Construction Control Inc. ("CCI"), to estimate the cost of the necessary 
  restoration and repairs. Tesma retained Halsall Associates Limited ("Halsall") 
  for the same purpose. A representative of both firms testified at trial.</p>
<p>
  [11] The consultants' cost estimates varied dramatically. CCI's estimate was 
  $1,321,504.75 and included three months lost rents due to the anticipated time 
  required to effect the restoration and repair work. During the course of the 
  trial, this estimate was reduced to $1,275,745, exclusive of pre-and post- judgment 
  interest. In contrast, Halsall's total cost estimate was $119,700. </p>
<p>
  [12] Tesma vacated the leased premises on February 28, 1999 without undertaking 
  any restorations or repairs.</p>
<p>
  [13] Thereafter, Stellarbridge repaired the roof of the leased premises, at 
  a cost of $35,618.40. It did not undertake the balance of the restoration and 
  repair work identified by CCI. Instead, it carried out cosmetic improvements 
  to the leased premises and re-let the premises to a new tenant in November 1999. 
  </p>
<p>
  [14] Stellarbridge commenced proceedings against Magna and Tesma in July 1999, 
  claiming damages in the sum of $2 million for repairs, as well as damages for 
  lost rents. It also claimed pre- and post- judgment interest at the rate of 
  interest set out in the Lease, and costs. It also sought punitive damages, but 
  abandoned this claim at trial.</p>
<p>
  [15] Magna and Tesma admitted liability and the trial proceeded only on the 
  issue of the proper assessment of damages. In their statement of defence, Magna 
  and Tesma asserted that, at the end of the term of the Lease, the leased premises 
  "were in a condition consistent with the reasonable wear and tear expected 
  from industrial manufacturing operations over the course of ten years", 
  save and except for limited repairs identified by Halsall, which Tesma was prepared 
  to undertake. </p>
<p>
  II. RELEVANT LEASE TERMS</p>
<p>
  (1) Permitted Use of Leased Premises</p>
<p>
  [16] The Lease provided, in paragraph 4(l) thereof, that the leased premises 
  would be used for activities carried on by the lessee in its ordinary course 
  of business and, in that context, would only be used for industrial manufacturing 
  purposes incidental to the business of the lessee. </p>
<p>
  (2) Repair and Maintenance Obligations</p>
<p>
  [17] The Lease contained various covenants by the lessee to clean, repair and 
  maintain the leased premises: </p>
<p class="indent">
  4. THE LESSEE COVENANTS AND AGREES with the Lessor as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">(f) At its own expense, to properly carry out all repairs, which 
  repairs shall include, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, leaks

  of the demised premises and of all machinery and equipment situate therein or 
  thereon (both inside and outside and including any stairs or platforms leading 
  thereto), and to repair and maintain the demised premises, reasonable wear and 
  tear (not inconsistent with the maintenance of the building as first class industrial 
  premises having regard for the then age of the building) and structural defects 
  and repairs to the roof, walls, foundations and cracks to floors not caused 
  by the Lessee's acts, omissions or neglect, only excepted.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(h) In the event of the observance of any apparent structural 
  defect or material damage to the demised premises by or damage forthwith upon 
  the same becoming known to the Lessee; provided that if such defects or damages 
  becomes known to the Lessee or reasonably should have been observed by the Lessee 
  and the Lessee fails to give notice thereof to the Lessor, the Lessee shall 
  be liable for such of the costs incurred by the Lessor in repairing the said 
  defect or damage as can be shown to be directly attributable to the actions 
  of the Lessee and those for whom in law the Lessee is responsible (including 
  additional costs incurred by the Lessor in repairing such defects or damages 
  for reason of the failure of the Lessee to give such notice) after such defect 
  or damage became known to the Lessee or reasonably should have been observed 
  by the Lessee.</p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(j) That upon the expiration of the term hereby granted the 
  Lessee will peaceably surrender, quit and deliver up the demised premises to 
  the Lessor in a good state of repair and maintenance, subject to the exceptions 
  herein provided.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">(s) (i) That it will, subject to paragraph 4(f), supra, during 
  the whole of the term hereby granted, pay the costs incurred in cleaning and 
  maintaining the demised premises, including, without limiting the generality 
  of the fore-going, snow removal, gardening, supervision, policing, painting 
  the outside of the building and maintenance, including repairs and maintenance 
  of paving curbs, walkways, landscaping and drainage as may from time to time 
  become necessary, and other reasonable costs which may be incurred with respect 
  to demised premises;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) The manner in which the demised premises shall be maintained 
  shall be at the sole discretion of the Lessor provided that the said manner 
  shall be reasonable and in keeping with the maintenance of a first class industrial 
  building having regard for the then age of the building.</p>
<p class="indent">[emphasis added]</p>
<p>(3) Restoration Obligations</p>
<p>
  [18] The Lease also contained covenants requiring the lessee to restore the 
  leased premises: </p>
<p class="indent">
  5. PROVIDED that the Lessee may remove its fixtures, provided that the Lessee 
  shall not remove or carry away from the demised premises any buildings or part 
  thereof or any plumbing, heating, ventilating, lighting equipment, wiring or 
  electric panels and services, or other building services; provided the Lessee 
  shall repair any damage occasioned to the premises by the installation or removal 
  of its fixtures and shall restore the demised premises to the state that existed 
  prior to such installation.</p>
<p class="center">
&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent"> 10. THE LESSOR COVENANTS WITH THE LESSEE as follows: </p>
<p class="center">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) That the Lessee shall have the right from time to time 
  to make alterations and changes in the interior of the demised premises as it 
  may find necessary for its purposes and at its own expense, provided that plans 
  for such alterations or changes shall be delivered to the Lessor and the consent 
  of the Lessor in writing shall first be obtained, such consent not to be unreasonably 
  or arbitrarily withheld. Provided that the Lessee shall before undertaking any 
  such work, alterations or improvements provide to the Lessor an opportunity 
  to complete such work, alterations or improve-ments on the same terms and conditions 
  as any other person, firm or corporation that the Lessee intends to engage for 
  the purpose of such work, alterations or improvements. The Lessee shall give 
  to the Lessor seven days notice in writing, within which the Lessor shall have 
  the right to match the terms and conditions of such other person, firm or corporation 
  that the Lessee intends to engage. Such notice shall set out the full details 
  of the work, alterations and improvements and the terms and conditions which 
  the Lessee proposes to accept. The Lessee shall not if the Lessor does not exercise 
  its right of first refusal herein granted, alter the terms and conditions without 
  first giving notice to the Lessor and allowing the Lessor a further right as 
  herein set out to match such altered terms and conditions. Provided that upon 
  the termination of this lease the Lessee, if requested by the Lessor, shall 
  restore the interior of the demised premises to its former condition immediately 
  prior to the installation of such alterations or changes, reasonable wear and 
  tear excepted, not inconsistent with the maintenance of the building as a first 
  class industrial building having regard for the then age of the building, including 
  the restoration of such standard fixtures as may have been installed by the 
  Lessor, and if not so requested any such changes or alterations shall become 
  the property of the Lessor.</p>
<p class="indent">[emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  (4) Additional Rent and Interest</p>
<p>
  [19] In addition, the Lease provided for the payment by the lessee of additional 
  rent and interest in specific circumstances: </p>
<p class="indent">
  13. IN THE EVENT that the Lessee shall make default in the payment of any sum 
  required to be paid by it or shall make default in the performance of any covenant 
  or the doing of any thing required to be performed or done by it hereunder, 
  and such default is not remedied within fifteen days after notice from the Lessor, 
  then the Lessor shall have the right to pay any such sum so in default or to 
  perform or do any such thing and such sums so paid or the costs of performing 
  or doing such things, and in every such case, shall be deemed to be additional 
  rent payable under the provisions of this lease and the Lessor shall be entitled 
  to charge all such sums or moneys to the Lessee and the Lessee shall pay them 
  forthwith on demand; and the Lessor in addition to any other rights, shall have 
  the same remedies and may take the same steps for the recovery of all such sums 
  or moneys as it might have taken for the recovery of rent in arrears under the 
  terms of this lease. All arrears of rent and moneys payable as rent or additional 
  rent under the terms of this lease which may be in arrears shall bear interest 
  at the rate of five per cent (5%) per annum above the prime rate of the Canadian 
  Imperial Bank of Commerce from time to time from the time such arrears become 
  due and payable until paid to the Lessor [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  III. TRIAL JUDGE'S DECISION</p>
<p> [20] The action was tried over sixteen days before E. MacDonald J. of the 
  Superior Court of Justice. By reasons for judgment dated March 12, 2002, the 
  trial judge awarded Stellarbridge damages in the total amount of $989,658.98 
  for: </p>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  [21] The trial judge applied the Betterment Discount to the Restoration, Repair 
  and Management Fee Awards, thereby reducing the damages awarded to Stellarbridge 
  by a total sum of $279,379.36. Although the trial judge also initially applied 
  the Betterment Discount to the Lost Rents Award, upon reconsideration and by 
  supplementary reasons for judgment dated September 23, 2002, she restored the 
  Lost Rents Award in full. In the result, Stellarbridge was awarded total net 
  damages in the amount of $710,279.62.</p>
<p>
  [22] The trial judge also awarded Stellarbridge pre- and post- judgment interest 
  at the rate of 5% above the applicable prime rate of the Canadian Imperial Bank 
  of Commerce, as provided under paragraph 13 of the Lease (the "Lease Rate"). 
  She declined, however, to award pre- judgment interest for the three-month period 
  commencing March 1, 1999 and ending May 31, 1999, on the basis of CCI's estimate 
  that three months would be required to carry out the necessary restoration and 
  repair work to the leased premises (the "Repair Period"). The Lost 
  Rents Award, however, was made for rents lost during the Repair Period. </p>
<p>
  [23] Finally, the trial judge awarded Stellarbridge its costs of the action 
  on a partial indemnity basis. In doing so, she accepted hourly billing rates 
  of $350 and $300 for Stellarbridge's two trial counsel, although Stellarbridge 
  was billed by its counsel at hourly billing rates of $375 and $225, respectively. 
  She also held that the fees and disbursements actually billed to Stellarbridge 
  by its counsel should not influence the quantum of costs to which Stellarbridge 
  was otherwise entitled on a partial indemnity scale under the costs grid established 
  by the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.</p>

<p>
  IV. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [24] The parties assert that the trial judge erred in the following ways: (a) 
  in her application of the Betterment Discount to various heads of damages; (b) 
  in granting the Lost Rents Award or, in the alternative, in failing to apply 
  the Betterment Discount to the Lost Rents Award; (c) in declining to award pre- 
  judgment interest for the Repair Period; (d) in fixing the rate of pre- and 
  post- judgment interest at the Lease Rate of interest; and (e) in her approach 
  to awarding costs in favour of Stellarbridge.</p>
<p>
  V. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) Betterment Discount</p>
<p>
  (a) Meaning of 'Betterment' in this Case</p>
<p>
  [25] The word 'betterment' is not mentioned in the Lease; nor does the Lease 
  expressly provide for a discount on account of 'betterment' to any damages claimed 
  by the lessor for breach of the lessee's restoration and/or repair covenants. 
  </p>
<p>
  [26] In my view, in the context of leased premises and according to its popular 
  and ordinary usage, the word 'betterment' refers to the improvement or enhancement 
  of the premises, the cost of which a defaulting lessee may be entitled to credit 
  or set-off if sued for damages in consequence of the lessee's breaches of restoration 
  or repair covenants. In this action, however, the term 'betterment' as used 
  by the parties acquired a different meaning. The parties agree that, as used 
  by them throughout the action and as referenced by the trial judge in her reasons 
  for judgment, the word 'betterment' referred to the 'reasonable wear and tear' 
  exceptions in the Lease and, thus, to the deterioration in the condition of 
  the leased premises over the term of the Lease. </p>
<p>
  (b) Measure of Damages</p>
<p>
  [27] The trial judge assessed the measure of Stellarbridge's damages on the 
  basis of the cost of the requisite restorations and repairs to the leased premises, 
  less 35% for 'betterment' or 'reasonable wear and tear'. Magna and Tesma did 
  not plead dimunition in value of the leased premises as an alternative approach 
  to the proper measure of damages in this case. Nonetheless, at their urging, 
  the trial judge considered the appropriateness of the 'dimunition in value' 
  approach. Her rejection of it, in favour of a measure of damages based on the 
  cost of restorations and repairs, is not challenged in these proceedings.</p>
<p>
  (c) Positions of the Parties</p>
<p>
  [28] Stellarbridge argues that the Betterment Discount should not have been 
  applied to the Restoration and Management Fee Awards at all and that a proper 
  'betterment' discount to the Repair Award, if any, should not have exceeded 
  20%, at the highest.</p>
<p>
  [29] Stellarbridge makes four principal submissions in support of this argument. 
  First, it submits that there is a critical difference between the lessee's covenants 
  to repair the leased premises and its covenants to restore the leased premises. 
  The latter obligations required the lessee, either during the term of the Lease 
  or upon its expiry, to restore the leased premises to their former condition 
  immediately before any change or alteration to the premises. As the leased premises 
  here consisted of a brand new industrial building at the outset of the term 
  of the Lease, Stellarbridge maintains that the lessee was required to restore 
  the premises to a similar pristine condition at the end of the Lease or face 
  liability for the cost of such restoration. </p>
<p>
  [30] Second, Stellarbridge contends that the lessee bore the evidential burden 
  of bringing itself within the reasonable wear and tear exceptions within the 
  Lease. In other words, the lessee had the onus at trial to establish both its 
  entitlement to a 'betterment' discount and the appropriate rate of discount 
  under those exceptions. </p>
<p>
  [31] Third, Stellarbridge asserts that the selection of 35% as the rate of the 
  Betterment Discount in this case lacks any evidentiary foundation. It submits 
  that the 35% Betterment Discount utilized by the trial judge is arbitrary and 
  speculative. </p>
<p>
  [32] Finally, and in any event, Stellarbridge submits that there is no rational 
  or principled basis upon which the Betterment Discount, or any discount for 
  'betterment', could be applied to the Management Fee Award.</p>
<p>
  [33] Magna and Tesma argue that the lessee's obligations to restore and repair 
  the leased premises were subject to the reasonable wear and tear exceptions 
  contained in the Lease. Consequently, they submit that Stellarbridge was not 
  entitled to the return of the leased premises in a new, pristine condition at 
  the end of the Lease. Rather, it was only entitled to compensation for the lessee's 
  obligations to restore and repair the leased premises, which obligations were 
  qualified by the reasonable wear and tear exceptions. Thus, they argue that 
  the trial judge was correct to apply the Betterment Discount as she did. Moreover, 
  she should also have applied it to the Lost Rents Award.</p>
<p>
  [34] Magna and Tesma also assert that Stellarbridge, as plaintiff, bore the 
  burden at trial of proving its damages. As the lessee was only required at the 
  end of the Lease to surrender to the lessor a building that had been subject 
  to ten years of permitted industrial manufacturing use and reasonable wear and 
  tear, Stellarbridge was obliged, and failed, to prove its damages by taking 
  both this usage and the reasonable wear and tear exceptions into account in 
  calculating its damages. In these circumstances, Magna and Tesma contend that 
  it was reasonable for the trial judge to determine the appropriate rate of the 
  Betterment Discount. They submit that the rate of 35% comports with the terms 
  of the Lease and that it was supported by the evidence of Halsall at trial on 
  behalf of Magna and Tesma. </p>
<p>
  (d) Discussion</p>
<p>
  (i) Entitlement to a betterment discount</p>
<p>
  [35] The trial judge concluded that the lessee's restoration and repair covenants 
  did not entitle Stellarbridge to the return of a brand new, pristine industrial 
  building at the end of the Lease. I agree, for the following reasons.</p>
<p>
  [36] First, a plain reading of the relevant parts of the Lease indicates that 
  the lessee's repair and maintenance covenants were not absolute. Its covenant 
  to surrender the leased premises in "a good state of repair and maintenance" 
  (paragraph 4(j)), was subject to the exceptions provided in paragraph 4 of the 
  Lease. Paragraph 4(f) of the Lease provided an exception for, "reasonable 
  wear and tear (not inconsistent with the maintenance of the building as first 
  class industrial premises having regard for the then age of the building)&#133;". 
  As well, the standard for maintenance of the leased premises, established by 
  paragraph 4(s)(ii) of the Lease, contemplated that the manner of maintenance 
  was to be "reasonable" and "in keeping with the maintenance of 
  a first class industrial building having regard for the then age of the building". 
  Thus, the lessee's obligations to repair and maintain the leased premises were 
  qualified by a reasonable wear and tear exception, which itself required consideration 
  of both the character of the leased premises as first class industrial premises, 
  and the aging of the building over the ten-year term of the Lease.</p>
<p>
  [37] Similarly, the lessee's covenant under paragraph 10(b) of the Lease to 
  restore the leased premises after making alterations or changes to the interior 
  of the premises was also subject to a reasonable wear and tear exception. Consistent 
  with paragraph 4(s)(ii) of the Lease, the reasonable wear and tear exception 
  to the lessee's restoration obligation was described in paragraph 10(b) as being 
  "not inconsistent with the maintenance of the building as a first class 
  industrial building having regard for the then age of the building". Although 
  the lessee's restoration obligation concerning the removal of its fixtures was 
  not qualified by the same exception (see paragraph 5 of the Lease), it is clear 
  that upon the expiry of the Lease term, the lessee's overall restoration obligation 
  was limited by reasonable wear and tear. </p>
<p>
  [38] Therefore, a plain reading of the Lease suggests that something less than 
  a brand new industrial building was to be surrendered to the lessor upon the 
  termination of the Lease. </p>
<p>
  [39] Second, as a matter of contract law, the quantification of both repair 
  and restoration obligations may be subject to deductions for reasonable wear 
  and tear. The courts have recognized, for example, that the measure of damages 
  for the breach of a lessee's repair covenant depends upon the state of repair 
  of the premises to which the lessor is entitled under the bargain made by the 
  parties. </p>
<p>
  [40] This principle was enunciated in the early case of Joyner v. Weeks, [1891] 
  2 Q.B. 31 (C.A.). In that case, a tenant had covenanted to keep leased premises 
  in repair during the term of the lease and to leave the premises in repair at 
  the end of the lease term. Lord Esher M.R. described the measure of the landlord's 
  damages for breach of the repair covenant this way (at p. 43): </p>
<p class="indent">
  [W]here there is a lease with a covenant to leave the premises in repair at 
  the end of the term, and such covenant is broken, the lessee must pay what the 
  lessor proves to be a reasonable and proper amount for putting the premises 
  into the state of repair in which they ought to have been left [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  See also the reasons of Fry L.J. in Joyner, at p. 45.</p>
<p>
  [41] Subsequently, in Haskell v. Marlow, [1928] 2 K.B. 45 (C.A.), Talbot J. 
  described the meaning and scope of a repair covenant qualified by a reasonable 
  wear and tear exception (at pp. 58-59): </p>
<p class="indent">
  The meaning is that the tenant (for life or years) is bound to keep the house 
  in good repair and condition, but is not liable for what is due to reasonable 
  wear and tear. That is to say, his obligation to keep in good repair is subject 
  to that exception. &#133; Reasonable wear and tear means the reasonable use 
  of the house by the tenant and the ordinary operation of natural forces. The 
  exception of want of repair due to wear and tear must be construed as limited 
  to what is directly due to wear and tear, reasonable conduct on the part of 
  the tenant being assumed. It does not mean that if there is a defect originally 
  proceeding from reasonable wear and tear the tenant is released from his obligation 
  to keep in good repair and condition everything which it may be possible to 
  trace ultimately to that defect. He is bound to do such repairs as may be required 
  to prevent the consequences flowing originally from wear and tear from producing 
  others which wear and tear would not directly produce [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [42] This description of the meaning and scope of a reasonable wear and tear 
  exception was subsequently approved in England by the House of Lords, unanimously 
  on this issue, in Regis Property Co. Ltd. v. Dudley, [1959] A.C. 370 (H.L.). 
  It was also endorsed in Ontario in Norbury Sudbury Ltd. v. Noront Steel (1981) 
  Ltd. (1984), 47 O.R. (2d) 548 at 561, per Krever J. (H.C.). </p>
<p>
  [43] Stellarbridge argues, however, that a restoration covenant is fundamentally 
  different from a repair covenant and that a discount for 'betterment', as that 
  term was used in this case, is the antithesis of the concept of restoration. 
  Accordingly, it submits that no betterment discount should have been applied 
  to the Restoration Award, as distinct from the Repair Award. I disagree.</p>
<p>
  [44] Although restoration and repair covenants impose distinct and separate 
  obligations, both covenants must be performed in accordance with the terms of 
  the lease in which they appear. In the absence of an express contractual provision 
  to the contrary, I do not accept that the measure of damages for breach of a 
  restoration covenant is necessarily different from the measure of damages for 
  breach of a covenant to repair. See for example, Buscombe v. James Stark &amp; 
  Sons Ltd. (1916), 30 D.L.R. 736 (B.C.C.A.), in which it was held, following 
  Joyner, supra, that the measure of damages for breach of a covenant to restore 
  leased premises to their original condition was the cost of putting the premises 
  into the state of repair required by the covenant.</p>
<p>
  [45] Nor do I accept that an obligation to restore contained in a commercial 
  lease is invariably engaged only upon the expiry of the term of the lease. The 
  restoration covenants in the Lease in this case illustrate this point. The language 
  of paragraph 5 of the Lease is sufficiently broad to support an obligation to 
  restore during the term of the Lease. In contrast, the lessee's restoration 
  obligation established by paragraph 10(b) of the Lease applied "upon the 
  termination of this lease". </p>
<p>
  [46] In the end, Stellarbridge's assertion that a betterment discount should 
  not apply to the Restoration Award is defeated by two factors. First, paragraph 
  10(b) of the Lease contains an express reasonable wear and tear exception. Acceptance 
  of Stellarbridge's argument that a betterment discount should not apply to the 
  Restoration Award would require reading-out that exception. This would offend 
  the negotiated agreement between the parties. The language of the exception 
  is not superfluous, and some meaning must be accorded to it. </p>
<p>
  [47] Second, as I have said, the trial judge held that the repair and restoration 
  covenants in the Lease did not require Magna and Tesma to "put" the 
  leased premises upon the termination of the Lease into the same condition as 
  that of a pristine, new building. That holding is amply supported by the terms 
  of the Lease, which authorize the use of the leased premises for industrial 
  manufacturing over ten years and which emphasize that the building was to be 
  maintained "as a first class industrial building having regard for the 
  then age of the building" [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [48] The fact that the lessee was entitled under the Lease to a discount for 
  'betterment', however, does not end the matter. It remains to be considered 
  whether the evidence at trial supported the 35% Betterment Discount actually 
  applied by the trial judge and, if not, what consequences flow from that deficiency. 
  I turn now to these issues.</p>
<p>
  (ii) Gap in the Evidence</p>
<p>
  [49] Stellarbridge alleged substantial damage to the building interior, exterior 
  walls, roof systems, pavement and mechanical and electrical systems of the leased 
  premises. The trial judge found that the leased premises consisted of a brand 
  new building at the beginning of the Lease and that, at the end of the Lease, 
  the building was left in a dirty and unkempt state. She also held that there 
  were numerous structural changes to the interior and exterior of the premises 
  that offended the lessee's restoration obligations. She accepted Stellarbridge's 
  evidence on the extent of the structural changes made to the building by Tesma. 
  None of these findings is challenged in this proceeding.</p>
<p>
  [50] The trial judge also concluded, with one important qualification, that 
  CCI's estimate of the cost of the required restoration and repair work was reasonable. 
  However, CCI's report assumed that the lessee was obliged to surrender a brand 
  new building to the lessor at the end of the Lease. I have already concluded 
  that the trial judge was right to reject that proposition. Because of that erroneous 
  premise underlying its report, CCI did not take into account the impact of the 
  reasonable wear and tear exceptions in the Lease. As well, its cost estimate 
  was not adjusted in consideration of the industrial manufacturing use of the 
  leased premises or in recognition of the age of the premises at the end of the 
  ten-year Lease. Thus, CCI's cost estimate overstated the cost of the necessary 
  restorations and repairs to the leased premises. </p>
<p>
  [51] The evidence of Halsall, the defence consultants, was flawed to an even 
  greater extent. The trial judge held at para. 27 that: "[T]he Halsall report 
  and its contents were created to minimize the obligation to restore. The evidence 
  of witnesses supporting the report was tailored to achieve this objective." 
  In addition, only some of the relevant covenants in the Lease were referenced 
  in the Halsall report and Halsall was not requested to respond to all the cost 
  items identified by CCI.</p>
<p>
  [52] Moreover, contrary to the submission of Magna and Tesma in these proceedings, 
  in my view, the Halsall evidence does not support the 35% Betterment Discount 
  applied by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [53] In its report, Halsall does not discuss the entitlement of the lessee to 
  a discount for 'betterment', or the rate of any such discount. In the case of 
  two repair items identified by Halsall, the cost of the lessee's 'responsibility' 
  for each repair item is stated in the report to be less than the full amount 
  of the cost of repair as estimated by Halsall. Thus, the lessee's liability 
  for the cost of these repairs was 'discounted'. The actual 'discounts' for these 
  items were 25% and 20% of the estimated repair costs, respectively. The record 
  before this court discloses no rationale for these varying discounts or for 
  the rates of discount selected by Halsall. </p>
<p>
  [54] Before this court, Magna and Tesma do not rely on these discounted repair 
  entries in the Halsall report. Rather, they argue that the trial judge was entitled 
  to have regard to the range of difference between the Halsall and CCI cost estimates 
  to determine an appropriate rate of 'betterment' discount, based on the reasonable 
  wear and tear exceptions in the Lease. I am unable to accept this submission. 
  Halsall's cost estimate was about 10% of CCI's estimate. As counsel for Stellarbridge 
  urged before this court, to suggest that there is a range between 10% and 90% 
  for a proper rate of 'betterment' discount is to posit no meaningful range of 
  discount at all.</p>
<p>
  [55] Accordingly, none of the expert evidence adduced by the parties supported 
  the 35% Betterment Discount. Similarly, there is no evidentiary foundation for 
  the 20% maximum 'betterment' discount that Stellarbridge submits should apply, 
  if any 'betterment' discount is to apply, to the Repair Award. This critical 
  gap in the evidence made the trial judge's task in assessing Stellarbridge's 
  damages understandably most difficult.</p>
<p>
  [56] The trial judge was alive to the implications of the lack of evidence concerning 
  an appropriate rate of 'betterment' discount. In commenting on the weaknesses 
  of the CCI report, she stated that it, "did not allow for the legal reality 
  that if the court assessed damages without regard for betterment, there would 
  be a windfall to Stellarbridge". The trial judge sought to avoid this windfall 
  by fixing the rate of discount for 'betterment' that she regarded as appropriate 
  in the circumstances. In doing so she stated (at para. 36): </p>
<p class="indent">
  I repeat that Stellarbridge, under the lease, cannot have a brand new building. 
  While a ten-year old building is not considered old, I have concluded that the 
  fairest discount is 35%. I could find little in the case law to assist on the 
  quantum of the discount.</p>
<p>
  To this, the trial judge might reasonably have added that there was nothing 
  in the evidence at trial to assist on the rate of the discount. </p>
<p>
  (iii) Consequences of the gap in the evidence</p>
<p>
  [57] The trial judge's objective in fixing the rate of the discount for 'betterment' 
  was clearly to arrive at what she regarded as a fair assessment of Stellarbridge's 
  damages. That objective accorded with the trial judge's duty to assess Stellarbridge's 
  damages in accordance with the terms of the Lease. In the unusual circumstances 
  of this case, however, I conclude that she erred in applying the 35% Betterment 
  Discount to Stellarbridge's established damages.</p>
<p>
  [58] The findings of fact made and the inferences of fact drawn by a trial judge 
  are not easily disturbed on appellate review. They attract a high degree of 
  deference from a reviewing court unless they reflect palpable and overriding 
  error in the trial judge's appreciation of the evidence or the trial judge made 
  findings that are not supported by the record. See Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 
  2 S.C.R. 235 and Equity Waste Management of Canada v. Halton Hills (Town) (1997), 
  35 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [59] In the case at bar, there was simply no evidentiary foundation to ground 
  any particular rate of discount for 'betterment'.</p>
<p>
  [60] In my view, Magna and Tesma bore the burden at trial of establishing both 
  their entitlement to a 'betterment' discount under the Lease and the rate of 
  the discount that they claimed. In Pleet v. Canadian Northern Quebec R.W. Co. 
  (1921), 50 O.L.R. 223 (C.A.), the court stated at para. 18: </p>
<p class="indent">
  No doubt the general rule is that he who asserts must prove, and that the onus 
  is generally upon the plaintiff, but there are two well-known exceptions: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) That where the subject-matter of the allegation lies particularly 
  within the knowledge of one of the parties, that party must prove it, whether 
  it be of an affirmative or negative character&#133; .</p>
<p class="indent">(2) That he who relies on an exception to the general rule must 
  prove that he comes within the exception&#133; [citations omitted].</p>
<p>[61] In Levesque v. J. Clark &amp; Son Ltd., [1972] N.B.J. No. 206 (Q.B.), 
  the lessee covenanted in a lease to maintain the leased premises in good condition 
  and to return the leased premises on termination of the lease in the same condition 
  in which they were leased, "reasonable wear and tear only excepted". 
  The lessee relied on the reasonable wear and tear exception at trial to deny 
  any liability to the landlord for proven deficiencies in the condition of the 
  premises at the end of the lease. In rejecting this position, Dickson J. stated 
  at para. 12: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Similarly, little evidence was adduced by the defendant to show that individual 
  items claimed were due to reasonable wear and tear. In this regard I think it 
  is well established in law that where proof is given that premises are not in 
  good repair and condition on the termination of a tenancy the onus is then on 
  the tenant to prove that the matters complained of result from the reasonable 
  wear and tear excepted. See Halsbury (3d ed) Vol. 23, at page 581, where it 
  is also pointed out that the tenant, if reasonable wear and tear is excepted, 
  still "must take care his premises do not suffer more than the operation 
  of time and nature would effect and he is bound by reasonable applications of 
  labour to keep the (premises) as nearly as possible in the same condition as 
  when it was demised." [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [62] As well, in Haskell, supra, Talbot J. indicated with respect to a tenant's 
  obligation to keep leased premises in a state of good repair that: "If 
  any want of repair is alleged and proved in fact, it lies on the tenant to show 
  that it comes within the [reasonable wear and tear] exception" (at p. 59). 
  See also Regis Property Co., supra, at p. 377 and, by analogy, Dunlop Construction 
  Products Inc. (Receiver of) v. Flavelle Holdings Inc. (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 58 
  at 64, footnote 1, (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [63] This statement is also consistent with more general principles relating 
  to the burden of proof. In Snell v. Farrell, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 311, Sopinka J. 
  referred with approval at para. 29 to the following statement of Lord Mansfield 
  in Blatch v. Archer (1774), 1 Cowp. 63, 98 E.R. 969 at 970: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is certainly a maxim that all evidence is to be weighed according to the 
  proof which it was in the power of one side to have produced, and in the power 
  of the other to have contradicted.</p>
<p>
  [64] In this case, the general burden of proof rested on Stellarbridge to prove 
  the losses for which it claimed compensatory damages. Magna and Tesma, however, 
  claimed that they were entitled to a reduction in the damages proven by Stellarbridge 
  on account of the reasonable wear and tear exceptions in the Lease. It was therefore 
  incumbent on them to show not only that the deficiencies in the leased premises 
  at the end of the Lease term came within those exceptions, but also the extent 
  of the reduction in damages (the rate of the discount) that they claimed in 
  reliance on those exceptions. </p>
<p>
  [65] This was not a case where Magna and Tesma were unable to call relevant 
  evidence concerning the appropriate value of the asserted discount. The trial 
  judge noted that representatives of Magna and Tesma, who were not called as 
  witnesses at trial, "had first hand knowledge on issues relevant to the 
  condition of the interior and exterior of the building". No evidence was 
  offered to suggest that these witnesses were unavailable to testify. Accordingly, 
  the trial judge drew an inference that the evidence of these witnesses would 
  not have assisted Magna and Tesma had it been led at trial. It was open to the 
  trial judge to draw such an adverse inference. That inference is entitled to 
  deference from this court.</p>
<p>
  [66] As observed by the Supreme Court in Snell v. Farrell, the law is particularly 
  alert to the opportunities of knowledge with respect to a fact to be proved: 
  see paragraphs 16, 30 and 31. Magna and Tesma, as the lessees in possession 
  of the leased premises throughout the term of the Lease, were uniquely positioned 
  to lead direct evidence relevant to the assessment of the discount claimed on 
  account of reasonable wear and tear. In contrast, there is no suggestion that 
  Stellarbridge, as a lessor not in possession, was similarly positioned to proffer 
  relevant evidence concerning the nature of the wear and tear and structural 
  changes occasioned to the leased premises, the timing and cause of their occurrence 
  and the extent of any efforts made by the lessee to remedy deterioration in 
  the leased premises. Those facts were within the knowledge of Magna and Tesma, 
  and they failed to produce such evidence at trial.</p>
<p>
  [67] Counsel for Magna and Tesma conceded before this court that there was no 
  specific evidence establishing that 35% was the appropriate rate for the requested 
  'betterment' discount. Moreover, the trial judge's supplementary reasons for 
  judgment dated September 23, 2002 indicate at para. 13 that, although counsel 
  referred to the principle of 'betterment': "[T]he actual figure for the 
  percentage discount was not explicitly canvassed in closing submissions at trial."</p>
<p>
  [68] In these circumstances, I am of the view that Magna and Tesma failed to 
  discharge their evidential burden to establish the appropriate rate of discount 
  applicable under the reasonable wear and tear exceptions in the Lease. They 
  must bear the consequences of that failure, which ultimately derives, in any 
  event, from their knowing and admitted failure to honour their restoration and 
  repair obligations under the Lease. In the absence of any evidence to support 
  the 35% Betterment Discount, or any rate of discount reflective of the wear 
  and tear actually occasioned to the leased premises, no 'betterment' discount 
  can be applied to the Restoration, Repair and Management Fee Awards.</p>
<p>
  [69] To the extent that this outcome may be said to result in 'windfall' damages 
  to Stellarbridge, Magna and Tesma cannot be heard to complain of a result occasioned 
  by their own failure to establish the reduction in damages from which they sought 
  to benefit. Trial judges are required to quantify a plaintiff's proven damages, 
  as best as they are able, based on the record before them. However, they are 
  not obliged to do so out of 'whole cloth' by fixing a discount for damages in 
  the absence of any supporting evidence and in the face of a litigant's failure 
  to adduce available, relevant evidence concerning the very facts in issue.</p>
<p>
  (2) Lost Rents Award</p>
<p>
  [70] Magna and Tesma attack the Lost Rents Award on three grounds. First, they 
  argue that no provision in the Lease entitles the lessor to compensation in 
  the form of lost rents for the time required to effect restorations and repairs 
  to the leased premises. Second, since Stellarbridge was able to let the premises 
  to a new tenant after carrying out only repairs to the roof and cosmetic improvements, 
  Magna and Tesma submit that Stellarbridge suffered no loss on account of the 
  Repair Period. Finally, in the alternative, Magna and Tesma contend that the 
  Betterment Discount should also have been applied to the Lost Rents Award. I 
  would not give effect to these submissions.</p>
<p>
  [71] Magna and Tesma's alternative argument that the trial judge should have 
  applied the Betterment Discount to the Lost Rents Award may be dealt with summarily. 
  The evidentiary gap at trial concerning the appropriate rate of discount for 
  'betterment', which I have previously described, applied to all heads of damages 
  claimed by Stellarbridge. Accordingly, there is no evidentiary foundation to 
  support the 35% Betterment Discount in respect of any of the damages awarded 
  to Stellarbridge, including those comprising the Lost Rents Award. Magna and 
  Tesma's alternative argument therefore fails.</p>
<p>
  [72] In addition, the assertion that the trial judge erred in making the Lost 
  Rents Award is also unsustainable. There was ample evidence to support the trial 
  judge's conclusion that a three-month Repair Period was required to effect the 
  restoration and repair work to the leased premises. Although the respondents' 
  expert, Halsall, maintained that the necessary work could be completed in six 
  weeks, CCI estimated that three months would be required. The trial judge, as 
  she was entitled to do, accepted CCI's estimate.</p>
<p>
  [73] The trial judge found that the leased premises remained unoccupied from 
  the end of the Lease term until November 1999. She also held: "I find nothing 
  in the evidence that suggests that [the owner of Stellarbridge] or his agents 
  could have found a tenant to replace Tesma sooner than October-November 1999." 
  Thus, although Stellarbridge may have been able to offer the leased premises 
  for rent after completion of the roof and cosmetic repairs, the evidence accepted 
  by the trial judge did not establish that a replacement lessee was available 
  until about eight months after the end of the Lease, well after the expiry of 
  the Repair Period.</p>
<p>
  [74] The trial judge was of the view that Stellarbridge's decision not to carry 
  out repairs and restorations to the leased premises, other than the roof repairs, 
  was not fatal to its claim for damages for lost rents during the Repair Period. 
  I agree. This court has recognized that damages may be awarded to a landlord 
  for a tenant's breach of its covenant to repair on the basis of the estimated 
  cost of repair notwithstanding that the landlord has not effected the repairs 
  and may not intend to ever do so: Dunlop, supra, at pp. 64-65. See also Joyner, 
  supra, at pp. 42-45, especially p. 44, and Buscombe, supra, at p. 158. In my 
  view, the same principle applies to a claim for damages for lost rents.</p>
<p>
  [75] In addition, contrary to Magna and Tesma's submissions, the Lease itself 
  contemplated that the cost of the performance of the lessee's covenants, in 
  specific circumstances, could entitle the lessor to additional rent in an equivalent 
  amount. Paragraph 13 of the Lease provided, in part, that if the lessee defaulted 
  in the performance of its covenants under the Lease or in the doing of any thing 
  required to be performed or done by it under the Lease, and if the default remained 
  unremedied for fifteen days after notice of default from the lessor, the lessor 
  was entitled to remedy the default. In that event, paragraph 13 stated: "[T]he 
  costs of performing or doing such things, and in every such case, shall be deemed 
  to be additional rent payable under the provisions of this lease and the Lessor 
  shall be entitled to charge all such sums or moneys to the Lessee&#133;" 
  As well, paragraph 13 authorized the lessor to seek to recover such sums or 
  moneys in the same manner as might be undertaken "for the recovery of rent 
  in arrears". The trial judge's grant of the Lost Rents Award, in essence, 
  recognized that the parties had envisaged an entitlement by the lessor to 'additional 
  rent' if the lessee breached its contractual obligations.</p>
<p>
  [76] Finally, and significantly, Tesma itself acknowledged Stellarbridge's entitlement 
  to lost rents for the time required to effect necessary repairs to the leased 
  premises. In a letter dated April 5, 1999 to Stellarbridge, Tesma stated its 
  intention to complete the repair work identified by Halsall and also indicated 
  its willingness to compensate Stellarbridge "for reasonable lost rent" 
  during the period required to complete the identified repairs. Although Tesma 
  also took the position in its letter that the requisite time for repairs was 
  a period of up to four weeks, rather than the Repair Period ultimately accepted 
  by the trial judge, it nonetheless recognized the lessor's entitlement to lost 
  rents while restorations and repairs were carried out to the premises. In its 
  response to Tesma's letter, delivered on April 12, 1999, Stellarbridge confirmed 
  that it would "continue to look to [Tesma] for rental loss during [the 
  restoration and repair] period". Accordingly, Tesma was aware from an early 
  point in the dispute that Stellarbridge's claim for lost rents was a live issue 
  for the period that the premises were unoccupied to permit restoration and repair 
  work. Knowing this, Magna and Tesma elected not to carry out restorations and 
  repairs to the leased premises.</p>
<p>
  [77] In all these circumstances, Magna and Tesma's challenge of the Lost Rents 
  Award cannot succeed. </p>
<p>
  (3) Award of Pre- and Post- Judgment Interest</p>
<p>
  [78] The trial judge's award of pre- and post- judgment interest to Stellarbridge 
  is challenged on two grounds: (a) Stellarbridge attacks the trial judge's failure 
  to award pre-judgment interest for the Repair Period; and (b) Magna and Tesma 
  assert that the trial judge erred by fixing the rate of pre- and post- judgment 
  interest at the Lease Rate.</p>
<p>
  (a) Duration of Pre- judgment Interest</p>
<p>
  [79] Stellarbridge argues that pre- judgment interest should have been awarded 
  under paragraph 13 of the Lease, or pursuant to s. 128(1) of the CJA, supra, 
  from the date that its cause of action arose. This date, according to Stellarbridge, 
  was March 1, 1999 when Tesma abandoned the leased premises without carrying 
  out the requisite restorations and repairs. Contrary to the finding of the trial 
  judge, Stellarbridge asserts that there is no principled reason to delay the 
  commencement of the accrual of pre- judgment interest to June 1, 1999. I am 
  unable to accept this submission. </p>
<p>
  [80] Stellarbridge obtained the Lost Rents Award at trial based on CCI's estimate 
  that a three-month Repair Period was required for Stellarbridge to remedy Magna's 
  and Tesma's defaults under the Lease. The premise of the Lost Rents Award, therefore, 
  rests on the requirement of the Repair Period and the corresponding theory that 
  Stellarbridge would not sustain any damages, other than lost rents, until the 
  expiry of the Repair Period. The effect of the Lost Rents Award, the grant of 
  which Stellarbridge defends, is thus to defer the onset of Stellarbridge's damages 
  for breach of the lessee's restoration and repair covenants until the end of 
  the Repair Period. </p>
<p>
  [81] The Lost Rents Award was intended to keep Stellarbridge 'whole' financially 
  for the period when restorations and repairs were carried out, had they been 
  undertaken by the lessor. I am not persuaded that the trial judge erred in the 
  exercise of her discretion by disallowing pre- judgment interest for the same 
  period. To do otherwise would have the effect of compensating Stellarbridge 
  out of proportion to its loss.</p>
<p>
  (b) Rate of Interest</p>
<p>
  [82] I reach a different conclusion, however, concerning the trial judge's decision 
  to award pre- and post- judgment interest in accordance with the Lease Rate. 
  </p>
<p>
  [83] As relevant to these proceedings, the lessor was entitled to 'additional 
  rent' under paragraph 13 of the Lease upon satisfaction of three prerequisites: 
  (a) the lessee defaulted in the performance of one or more of its covenants 
  under the Lease or in the doing of any thing required to be performed or done 
  by it under the Lease; (b) the lessee's default remained unremedied fifteen 
  days after notice of default delivered by the lessor; and (c) the lessor performed 
  or did the thing required by the Lease to be performed or done by the lessee. 
  If all these prerequisites were met, the lessor's cost of remedying the lessee's 
  default was deemed under paragraph 13 to be 'additional rent' payable by the 
  lessee, arrears of which attracted the Lease Rate of interest until the arrears 
  were paid.</p>
<p>
  [84] Magna and Tesma argue that these prerequisites were not satisfied by Stellarbridge, 
  except in respect of the roof repairs, which cost $35,618.40. They submit that, 
  on proper application of paragraph 13 of the Lease, the Lease Rate of interest 
  should apply only to Stellarbridge's damages for the roof repairs and that the 
  applicable interest rate under the CJA should apply to Stellarbridge's other 
  damages. </p>

  [85] Trial judges enjoy a wide discretion under s. 130 of the CJA to allow pre- 
  or post- judgment interest at a rate higher or lower than the rate of interest 
  prescribed by the CJA where they consider it just to do so. An appellate court 
  may interfere with the discretionary decision of a trial judge only where it 
  reaches the clear conclusion that there has been a wrongful exercise of discretion 
  by the trial judge in that no weight, or insufficient weight, has been given 
  to relevant considerations: Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister 
  of Transport), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3 at 76-77 and Harelkin v. University of Regina, 
  [1979] 2 S.C.R. 561 at 588.</p>
<p>
  [86] Stellarbridge does not vigorously contend that paragraph 13 of the Lease 
  was engaged in respect of all of its damages. Rather, it argues that even if 
  paragraph 13 of the Lease is inapplicable, in the exercise of her discretion 
  under s. 130 of the CJA, the trial judge was not precluded from awarding interest 
  at the Lease Rate. Stellarbridge submits that the trial judge was free to treat 
  the Lease Rate of interest as evidence of the reasonable expectation of the 
  parties, both sophisticated corporations experienced with commercial leasing, 
  concerning the interest rate that was to apply in the event of default by the 
  lessee. </p>
<p>
  [87] This argument must be rejected in this case. The trial judge's supplementary 
  reasons for judgment dated September 23, 2002 indicate that the rate of pre- 
  and post- judgment interest fixed by her flowed from her implicit conclusion 
  that paragraph 13 of the Lease was engaged. She stated (at para. 15): </p>
<p class="indent">
  The rate of interest as prescribed in the lease should govern. I refer to Bank 
  of America Canada v. The Mutual Trust Company, (2002) S.C.C. 43 released April 
  26, 2002. To my mind this decision settles this issue. The lease is a commercial 
  contract negotiated by sophisticated parties. There is no reason to depart from 
  what has been provided for in their contract. Except in exceptional circumstances, 
  the contract is the best measure of the reasonable expectation of the parties. 
  Interest shall be as prescribed and contemplated in paragraph 13 of the Lease.</p>
<p>
  [88] In Bank of America Canada v. Mutual Trust Co., [2002] 2 S.C.R. 401, however, 
  the compound interest rate upheld by the Supreme Court was based on a specific 
  agreement between the parties, set out in a lending agreement, concerning the 
  cost of borrowing money over a particular period. The rationale for the Supreme 
  Court's decision was the compelling desirability of giving legal effect to the 
  contractual bargain reached by the parties: see in particular, the Supreme Court's 
  emphasis at paras. 46 and 50 on the need to give effect, as a matter of contract 
  law, to the expressed intentions of the contracting parties.</p>
<p>
  [89] In contrast, in this case, agreed-upon prerequisites to the application 
  of the contractual interest rate were unfulfilled. Stellarbridge did not perform 
  the required restorations and repair work - except for the roof repairs - as 
  contemplated under paragraph 13 of the Lease. </p>
<p>
  [90] Moreover, and importantly, there was no contractual 'bargain' between the 
  parties regarding the interest rate that was to apply other than in the circumstances 
  set out in paragraph 13 of the Lease.</p>
<p>
  [91] Although it was open to the trial judge to award pre- and post- judgment 
  interest under s. 130 of the CJA at the Lease Rate even if paragraph 13 of the 
  Lease was not engaged, in my opinion she did not award interest on this basis. 
  Her reasons reflect no consideration of the prerequisites to the application 
  of the Lease Rate; nor do they suggest that her award of interest at the Lease 
  Rate was based on s. 130 of the CJA. Accordingly, in my view, the trial judge's 
  award of pre- and post- judgment interest at the Lease Rate is unsupportable.</p>
<p>
  [92] The trial judge held that the applicable interest rate under the CJA was 
  5.3%. Stellarbridge does not dispute this finding. I conclude that this rate 
  is the appropriate pre- and post- judgment interest rate in this case, except 
  in respect of the actual losses sustained by Stellarbridge in repairing the 
  roof of the leased premises. Accordingly, I would allow interest at the Lease 
  Rate on Stellarbridge's costs of effecting the roof repairs ($35,618.40) and 
  interest at the rate of 5.3% on the balance of the damages awarded at trial 
  to Stellarbridge.</p>
<p>
  (4) Costs Award at Trial</p>
<p>
  [93] The trial judge awarded Stellarbridge its costs of the action on a partial 
  indemnity basis, fixed in the amount of $105,359.95. As well, Stellarbridge 
  was awarded the sum of $2,500 for its costs incurred at the costs hearing before 
  the trial judge. Accordingly, Stellarbridge was awarded the total amount of 
  $107,859.95 for costs.</p>
<p>
  [94] Magna and Tesma argue that the trial judge erred in her approach to awarding 
  costs to Stellarbridge in two respects. First, her costs award was based upon 
  hourly billing rates for counsel that, in the case of Stellarbridge's associate 
  trial counsel, exceeded the hourly billing rate actually charged to Stellarbridge.</p>
<p>
  [95] Second, during the course of the costs hearing, the trial judge was informed 
  that the total amount billed to Stellarbridge by its counsel as of May 9, 2001 
  was the sum of $118,308 for fees and $4,366 for disbursements. The trial judge 
  declined to consider the amount of the billed fees to Stellarbridge as a relevant 
  factor in determining an appropriate costs award. She said in her supplementary 
  reasons for judgment dated September 23, 2002 (at para. 8): </p>
<p class="indent">
  I approach the matter with reference to the costs grid and what it generates 
  when I apply it to the draft bill of costs on a partial indemnity scale submitted 
  by [Stellarbridge's counsel]. The amount billed to the plaintiff by [Stellarbridge's 
  counsel] is a private matter between him and the plaintiff. This amount should 
  not influence the determination of the amounts that are generated by the partial 
  indemnity scale [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  In my view, this approach to awarding costs was in error. </p>
<p>
  [96] It is clear from the trial judge's reasons that she intended to award Stellarbridge 
  its costs on a partial indemnity basis. She expressly rejected Stellarbridge's 
  claim for costs on the higher, substantial indemnity scale. The effect of her 
  costs award, however, was to award costs that were closer to the substantial 
  indemnity scale than to the partial indemnity scale. </p>
<p>
  [97] The costs grid under the Rules of Civil Procedure came into effect in January 
  2002. The trial judge's reasons in support of her costs award were released 
  on September 23, 2002. At that time, the jurisprudence regarding the costs grid 
  was in an early state of evolution. Since that time, this court has confirmed 
  that the costs grid is not intended to provide windfall costs recovery to a 
  litigant. In addition, a critical controlling principle for the fixing of costs 
  under the costs grid is to ascertain an amount that is a fair and reasonable 
  sum to be paid by the unsuccessful litigant, rather than any exact measure of 
  the actual costs to the successful litigant: Zesta Engineering Ltd. v. Cloutier, 
  [2002] O.J. No. 4495 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [98] In arriving at an amount that is a fair and reasonable sum to be paid by 
  an unsuccessful litigant on the partial indemnity scale, the hourly billing 
  rates actually charged and the fees actually billed to the successful litigant 
  are relevant considerations. In this case, information concerning the fees and 
  rates charged was before the trial judge and should have been taken into account. 
  </p>
<p>
  [99] Although there is no evidence of a special fee arrangement in this case 
  similar to the arrangement discussed in Lawyers' Professional Indemnity Co. 
  v. Geto Investment Ltd., [2002] O.J. No. 921 (S.C.), this court has held that 
  it is not appropriate for a litigant to seek or receive an award of costs in 
  excess of those amounts actually charged to it: TransCanada Pipelines v. Potter 
  Station Power Limited Partnership, [2003] O.J. No. 2440. In the case at bar, 
  the trial judge's costs award had the effect of awarding to Stellarbridge costs 
  considerably in excess of the amounts, when calculated on a partial indemnity 
  basis, actually charged to it by its counsel.</p>
<p>
  [100] Accordingly, the quantum of the trial judge's award of costs must be set 
  aside. Since introduction of the costs grid under the Rules of Civil Procedure, 
  this court has fixed costs where the record before it permits it to do so. This 
  is such a case. I would grant leave to appeal costs and vary the quantum of 
  the trial judge's costs award, to allow Stellarbridge its costs of the action 
  and the costs hearing before the trial judge on a partial indemnity basis, fixed 
  in this case in the total amount of $73,484.80 for fees and $4,366 for disbursements, 
  plus Goods and Services Tax.</p>
<p>
  VI. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [101] For the reasons given, I would allow the appeal, in part, by varying paragraph 
  one of the judgment dated September 23, 2002 to increase the damages awarded 
  to Stellarbridge by the sum of $279,379.36, thereby yielding a total damages 
  award of $989,658.98. This eliminates the application of the 35% Betterment 
  Discount to the Restoration, Repair and Management Fee Awards. I would dismiss 
  the appeal in all other respects.</p>
<p>
  [102] I would also allow the cross-appeal, in part, by varying paragraphs three 
  and four of the trial judgment to provide that Stellarbridge recover pre- and 
  post- judgment interest at the Lease Rate on the sum of $35,618.40 and at the 
  rate of 5.3% on all other sums awarded to Stellarbridge at trial, as varied 
  by these reasons. I would also grant leave to appeal costs, set aside paragraph 
  two of the trial judgment and substitute in its stead an order that Stellarbridge 
  recover costs from Magna and Tesma in the sum of $73,484.80 for fees and $4,366 
  for disbursements, plus Goods and Services Tax, in respect of the costs of the 
  action and the costs hearing. I would dismiss the cross-appeal in all other 
  respects.</p>
<p>
  [103] As success has been divided in these proceedings, I would award no costs 
  of the appeal and cross-appeal.</p>
