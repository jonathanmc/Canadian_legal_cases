<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant submits that the eleven month sentence imposed for breach 
  of a non?contact clause in a recognizance of bail on a pending sexual assault 
  charge is outside the range for such an offence. We agree.</p>
<p>[2] The breach, which arose from an unintentional meeting with the victim that 
  lasted approximately two minutes, involved no threats or violence. Rather, the 
  appellant's behaviour was characterized as "whining" about the impact 
  that the sexual assault charge had on his life. Although the contact giving 
  rise to the breach was with the victim and the appellant had a criminal record 
  for acts of violence, criminal harassment and breaches of court orders, in all 
  the circumstances the offence does not reach the level of exceptional seriousness 
  that would warrant a sentence of eleven months.</p>
<p>[3] Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, and the sentence appeal 
  is allowed by reducing the sentence to four months, with two months credit for 
  pre?trial custody. The terms and conditions relating to probation remain unchanged.</p>
