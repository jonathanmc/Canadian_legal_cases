<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice H. M. Pierce of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated January 16, 2003.</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>
  [1] This action began in July 1995 as a claim by the plaintiffs Suddaby and 
  Fucile against the defendant Biocan Waste Management Systems for the repayment 
  of the loans made by the plaintiffs to the company, and against the defendant 
  Dr. Gary Zimak on his guarantee of those loans. </p>
<p>
  [2] The action proceeded through discoveries at a very leisurely pace over the 
  next seven years. While this was going on, Biocan became worthless. Then in 
  July 2002, three weeks before trial, the plaintiffs moved to amend their pleadings 
  to claim that their funds had been advanced to Zimak on his promise to repay 
  and that Zimak breached this contract of loan by failing to do so. </p>
<p>
  [3] The motion was dismissed by Pierce J. because she viewed the proposed amendment 
  as superfluous.</p>
<p>
  [4] Counsel for the defendants remained concerned that at trial the plaintiffs 
  would allege that their contracts were for the purchase of shares in Biocan 
  rather than contracts of loan. He raised this when the trial was called, and 
  in response, counsel for the plaintiff made clear that he was simply asserting 
  a contract of loan against Zimak, and that having received the money from the 
  plaintiffs, Zimak had a contractual obligation to repay it.</p>
<p>
  [5] In opening however, counsel for the plaintiffs put his case squarely on 
  an alleged breach of contracts between each plaintiff and Zimak to purchase 
  an interest in Biocan by buying some of his shares. Counsel for the defendants 
  did not object, or ask for an adjournment, but responded on the merits in his 
  own opening, and it appears that the trial proceeded with this as its basic 
  issue.</p>
<p>
  [6] In final argument, counsel for the plaintiffs filed and made reference to 
  a number of sections of the Ontario Business Corporations Act relating to the 
  transfer of shares. When opposing counsel objected, he made clear that he was 
  seeking no remedy pursuant to the OBCA, but merely sought to refer to these 
  statutory provisions in the context of the evidence called at trial concerning 
  whether the plaintiffs ever acquired shares in Biocan.</p>
<p>
  [7] After reserving for several months, the trial judge issued reasons which 
  gave judgment to the plaintiffs against Zimak for the full amount of the monies 
  which they had advanced together with interest. She based this remedy entirely 
  on provisions of the OBCA relating to the obligations to provide a shareholder 
  with a share certificate and to register the transfer of shares.</p>
<p>
  [8] The defendants appeal, saying that no remedy was requested pursuant to the 
  OBCA and that they had no opportunity to call evidence or make argument relevant 
  to these provisions.</p>
<p>
  [9] The respondents properly concede that the judgment based on the OBCA cannot 
  stand. The trial judge was not entitled to proceed as she did. It is inconsistent 
  with the principles of natural justice to grant judgment on a basis expressly 
  disavowed by counsel and where there has been no opportunity for relevant evidence 
  or argument. </p>
<p>
  [10] The respondents argue however that the result can be sustained by this 
  court on the footing of fundamental breach of contract for the purchase of shareholder 
  interests in Biocan coupled with the remedy of rescission. In making this argument 
  counsel concedes that this, not the breach of contracts of loan, is now unequivocally 
  the basis of his case.</p>
<p>
  [11] The appellants argue that if the respondents frame their action this way, 
  this court should dismiss it for at least three reasons. They say that there 
  was no fundamental breach of the contract to acquire shareholdings in Biocan 
  because in real terms, the acquisition happened. Moreover, there could be no 
  damages in any event because the shares were worthless. And finally the appellants 
  assert significant equitable defences to the remedy of rescission. </p>
<p>
  [12] In our view, the appeal must be allowed and the judgment against the appellants 
  including costs must be set aside. For clarity, this does not affect the dismissal 
  of the appellants' counterclaim which was not appealed.</p>
<p>
  [13] However, we cannot accede either to the appellants' request to dismiss 
  the action or the respondent's request to sustain the result on a different 
  basis. There is an absence of findings of fact on a number of issues that make 
  either of these courses impossible. For example, there is no finding as to the 
  precise terms of the contract alleged. Was it for the acquisition of shareholder 
  interests or simply for the delivery of share certificates? There is no assessment 
  of damages based on common law principles rather than the OBCA. Nor is there 
  any finding concerning the alleged equitable defences to the remedy of rescission. 
  Since we are not a trial court we cannot fill this void simply on reading the 
  transcript of evidence. </p>
<p>
  [14] There must therefore be a new trial. If the respondents choose to proceed, 
  they should amend their pleadings to set out the basis of their claim with precision. 
  Given the first trial, discovery should not be necessary, but can be conducted 
  if leave is given. </p>
<p>
  [15] As to costs, all participants have some responsibility for the unfortunate 
  way in which these proceedings have evolved. In the circumstances, we think 
  the costs order that best reflects this reality is that each side bear its own 
  costs of the trial that has taken place.</p>
<p>
  [16] Since the appellants have been successful in this court they are entitled 
  to costs of the appeal, at least if the respondents choose to proceed with the 
  new trial. We fix those costs on a partial indemnity basis at $10,000 payable 
  to the appellants in the cause of the new trial.</p>
