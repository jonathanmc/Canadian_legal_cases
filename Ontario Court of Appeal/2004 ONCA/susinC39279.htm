<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This is an appeal from the Order of Bain J. dismissing the appellant's 
  action for non-payment of costs. This action is rooted in a claim for breach 
  of a contract allegedly made in 1979. The Order of Bain J. stems from a motion 
  brought by the respondent in 1997. The appellant raises a number of issues and 
  also seeks to adduce as fresh evidence his own affidavit in which he states 
  that he has now paid the costs orders that led to the dismissal of his action. 
  For the following reasons the application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed 
  and the appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
<p>[2] The appellant submits that the motion judge erred in dismissing the action 
  because the grounds for the motion set out in the appellant's notice of motion 
  referred to Rule 60.12 but did not refer to Rule 57.03. There are two answers 
  to this submission. First, by the time the matter came before the motion judge 
  the appellant was on notice through the respondent's factum that he did intend 
  to rely on Rule 57.03. This case is therefore different from Susin v. Chapman, 
  [1998] O.J. No. 4764 (C.A.) where Rule 57.03 was not cited in the notice of 
  motion and the materials did not indicate that the order in that case was made 
  in the exercise of jurisdiction under that rule. Moreover, the appellant did 
  not object to the respondent's reliance on Rule 57.03 during the proceedings 
  before the motion judge and did not seek an adjournment of those proceedings. 
  Second, in our view, the Order in this case could have been made under Rule 
  60.12, which was referenced in the original notice of motion.</p>
<p>[3] The appellant also submits that the motion judge erred in finding that 
  the appellant was not impecunious. In the circumstances of this case, it was 
  open to the motion judge to make the finding that she did, relying in part on 
  the findings in six other proceedings that the appellant is not impecunious. 
  As she pointed out, the appellant argues he is impecunious when required to 
  pay costs but denies impecuniosity when an opposite party is seeking security 
  for costs.</p>
<p>[4] The appellant next submits that the Order could not be based on the costs 
  order made by Morden A.C.J.O. on November 21, 1995 because the costs did not 
  have to be paid forthwith. Assuming, without deciding, that those costs did 
  not become payable until the conclusion of the action, the amount involved was 
  only $300. The Order made by the motion judge was justified on the basis of 
  the other outstanding costs orders.</p>
<p>[5] This brings us to the appellant's principal submission. He argues that 
  the various orders by Maloney J., Valin J. and Cameron J. were final and not 
  interlocutory orders and, therefore, Rule 60.12 had no application. We do not 
  agree. Some of these orders were interlocutory in part or in whole. They arose 
  out of various interlocutory proceedings such as a refusals motion from cross-examination 
  and a motion to vary. See for example Diversitel Communications Inc. v. Glacier 
  Bay Inc., [2004] O.J. No. 10 (C.A.).</p>
<p>[6] Finally, the appellant submits that the motion judge erred in the exercise 
  of her discretion in dismissing an action, in which the appellant claimed damages 
  for millions of dollars, for failure to pay costs of $2,200. We have not been 
  persuaded that the motion judge erred in principle in the exercise of her discretion. 
  The appellant attempts to pursue litigation without paying the costs orders 
  made by various courts. He picks and chooses those orders that he will pay. 
  We are satisfied that the motion judge was entitled to make the order she did 
  given the lengthy history of these proceedings and the material that was before 
  her. </p>
<p>[7] With respect to the fresh evidence, we are not satisfied that this is a 
  proper case to allow the appeal because the appellant belatedly paid the outstanding 
  costs orders that formed the basis for the motion judge's order. This fresh 
  evidence is merely another example of the kind of conduct engaged in by the 
  appellant in &quot;cherry-picking&quot; those costs orders that, he hopes, will 
  allow him to continue to pursue his various claims. We note that back in February 
  2003 on a motion before Bain J. to re-open the dismissal motion the appellant 
  made an offer to pay the costs. Yet, he waited until August 30, 2003 before 
  paying the costs. [8] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed 
  at $5,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T. payable within 30 days.</p>
