<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Emile R. Millette of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated August 31, 2000.</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  SIMMONS J.A.: </p>
<p> [1] On August 31, 2000, Millette J. found the appellant guilty of sexual touching 
  and sexual assault. Applying the principle in R. v. Kienapple<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a>, 
  the trial judge convicted the appellant of sexual touching and conditionally 
  stayed the appellant's conviction for sexual assault. The appellant appeals 
  against his conviction.</p>
<p>
  [2] The charges against the appellant arose out of an incident that occurred 
  in August 1996. The appellant is married to the complainant's mother. At the 
  time of the incident, the then 12-year-old complainant was living with the appellant 
  and her mother. </p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant's main ground of appeal relates to the fact that, at trial, 
  the Crown led evidence of other allegations of sexual impropriety made by the 
  complainant against the appellant, as well as evidence of prior consistent statements 
  made by the complainant, without obtaining a ruling concerning the admissibility 
  of such evidence. The appellant asserts that the trial judge committed reversible 
  error by admitting the impugned evidence, by referring to some of it in his 
  summary of the evidence, and by failing to explain whether and how he used it.</p>
<p>
  [4] However, the appellant's position at trial was that the complainant fabricated 
  her allegations so that she could move to her father's home. Defence counsel 
  at trial (not Mr. Paciocco) not only did not object to the impugned evidence, 
  he adduced certain aspects of it and relied on the complainant's prior allegations 
  and statements as part of an all out attack on the complainant's credibility, 
  claiming that it demonstrated a motive to fabricate as well as a history of 
  embellishment.</p>
<p> [5] In these circumstances, it is not open to the appellant to object to the 
  admissibility of the impugned evidence for the first time on appeal<a href="#2">[2]</a><a name="r2"></a>. 
  While it would have been preferable had counsel or the trial judge specifically 
  adverted to the purposes for which the evidence was being admitted at the time 
  it was adduced, there is no suggestion in the trial judge's reasons that he 
  used any of the impugned evidence for an improper purpose, and I see no basis 
  for holding that the defence was in any way prejudiced. The evidence of other 
  prior statements not relied on by the defence was admissible to put the statements 
  relied on by the defence into proper context. I would not therefore give effect 
  to the appellant's main ground of appeal.</p>
<p>
  [6] As a further ground of appeal, the appellant claims that the trial judge 
  misapprehended the evidence adduced at trial and that he arrived at an unreasonable 
  verdict.</p>
<p>
  [7] I find no merit in the submission that the verdict was unreasonable. However, 
  for the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the trial judge failed to 
  advert to certain evidence that was important to the defence and that several 
  of the reasons that he advanced for rejecting the complainant's evidence did 
  not support his conclusion. I would therefore allow the appeal, quash the conviction 
  and order a new trial.</p>
<p>
  I. Background</p>
<p>
  i. The complainant's evidence concerning the incident forming the subject matter 
  of the charges</p>
<p>
  [8] The complainant was born on May 6, 1984. Her parents separated when she 
  was very young, and her mother subsequently married the appellant. The complainant's 
  mother and the appellant had one child together; the complainant's half-brother, 
  S., and the family of four lived together in Horton Township. </p>
<p>
  [9] At trial, the complainant described the incident forming the subject matter 
  of the charges as follows. In August 1996, the complainant, the appellant and 
  S. were at the family trailer located at a local campground. The complainant's 
  mother had not accompanied them to the trailer that evening. The complainant 
  testified that she went to sleep at about 11 p.m. on the top bunk of a set of 
  bunk beds and later awoke to find the appellant's hand in her underwear, touching 
  her vagina. The appellant left when she rolled away, but returned a few minutes 
  later and asked if she had been awake a minute ago. The complainant answered, 
  "no" and the appellant walked away. However, he returned again a short 
  time later and put his hand under her blanket. The complainant testified that 
  the appellant must have thought that she was asleep. She asked him what he was 
  doing and he responded that he was looking out the window. The appellant then 
  left the room and lay on the couch. From there, he asked whether she knew what 
  masturbation was. When she answered "no", he offered to show her. 
  The complainant said "no", and the incident ended. </p>
<p>
  ii. Evidence of other allegations of sexual improprieties</p>
<p>
  [10] In her evidence in-chief, the complainant described a subsequent incident 
  that happened at the trailer. She said that, on that occasion, she was sleeping 
  on the bottom bunk and S. was on the top bunk. She said that the appellant came 
  into the room with no clothes on and stood in front of the bunk bed with his 
  hands on the top bunk. She said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I thought he was doing something to my brother &#133; he kept on looking down 
  at me and sticking his penis closer and closer to my face so finally I rolled 
  over so I was facing the wall. Then he went to the bathroom and I got up and 
  ran to my mom and I told my mom &#133;</p>
<p>
  [11] In cross-examination, the complainant agreed that she told her mother that 
  the appellant had been "waving his dick around for twenty minutes ". 
  </p>
<p>
  [12] In addition, the complainant said in-chief that the appellant would sit 
  with his robe wide open, let his penis hang out and that he would masturbate 
  in front of her. She described one particular occasion when her friend, K.G. 
  was present with her when that occurred.</p>
<p>
  iii. Evidence of prior complaints</p>
<p>
  [13] At the outset of the appellant's trial, Crown counsel informed the court 
  that, before calling the complainant, he proposed to call the investigating 
  police officer and two other witnesses. In addition, Crown counsel indicated 
  that the complainant would describe a total of three incidents, two that occurred 
  at the trailer, and one that occurred at the family home. Crown counsel then 
  said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  There may be a legal issue as to hearsay evidence and recent complaint and the 
  Crown has a witness who would be giving some evidence about that hearsay aspect, 
  a young female companion of [the complainant]. I prefer &#133; to call that 
  witness before I call the complainant and I thought I should advise the Court 
  of that first and clarify that position with my friend before your honour. I 
  haven't discussed it in any detail with my friend. </p>
<p>
  [14] Defence counsel made no comment in response to the Crown's remarks.</p>
<p>
  [15] As its first witness, the Crown called the investigating officer, who testified 
  that she was first contacted in relation to this matter by the Children's Aid 
  Society in November 1998. The officer said that as the result of that contact 
  she was put in touch with the complainant's father. She said that she took a 
  statement from the complainant and obtained an excerpt of the complainant's 
  diary. She then interviewed three of the appellant's friends as well as a woman 
  who was living with the complainant's father at the time the complaint was made. 
  </p>
<p>
  [16] In cross-examination, defence counsel elicited evidence concerning the 
  content of the officer's interview of the complainant's friend, K.G. and also 
  questioned the officer about whether she had difficulty believing the complainant 
  as a result of the interview. In particular, the officer asked K.G. whether 
  anything unusual had happened on any occasion when she was visiting the complainant 
  and watching T.V. K.G. said no, but added that on one occasion the complainant 
  told her after they left the appellant's company that the appellant had his 
  hands down his pants while they were watching T.V. When asked by the officer 
  whether she would have noticed it if the incident had taken place, K.G. responded, 
  "[p]robably no because I don't think he would have done it if I was there". 
  </p>
<p>
  [17] The complainant's father was the second witness to testify. He said that 
  the complainant began living with him in about November of 1997. He called the 
  Children's Aid Society about the matters in issue after a woman he was living 
  with discovered the complainant's diary and showed it to him. He confirmed, 
  in cross-examination, that the complainant had been asking him if she could 
  live with him for some time prior to November of 1997.</p>
<p>
  [18] K.G. was the third witness to testify. In her evidence in-chief, she confirmed 
  that on one occasion when she was visiting the complainant, the complainant 
  told her that the appellant had been "playing with himself " earlier 
  while the three of them were watching T.V. K.G. testified in-chief that she 
  did not see that. In cross-examination she agreed that she could see the appellant 
  in plain sight from where she was seated.</p>
<p>
  [19] The complainant was the next witness to testify. In addition to the matters 
  already referred to, she testified in-chief that on the day following the first 
  incident she wrote a note to her mother describing what happened as she did 
  not want to tell her mother directly. Further, she said that prior to describing 
  the various incidents to the Children's Aid Society worker, she said had spoken 
  about the incidents to a boyfriend, J.E., and written about them in her diary. 
  In particular, she said that when writing in her diary, she addressed her comments 
  to a deceased grandmother she had never met.</p>
<p>
  [20] In cross-examination, the complainant maintained that she and her mother 
  got along "pretty good ". However, she agreed that she sometimes fought 
  with her mother because she did not like having to look after S., that she had 
  been asking her father to take her in for "a good year " prior to 
  November 1997, and that he kept promising that he would take her, but never 
  did. She agreed that after she went to live with her father, she told people 
  that her mother had kicked her out. In addition, she agreed that she wrote a 
  letter to J.E., in the fall of 1998, which included the following statements 
  that she said were true: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I told you that I was abused and do you want to know how I was abused? Well, 
  my mom hit me all the time and slapped me across the face and pulled my hair 
  and shit like that and she used to say I was a useless piece of shit and she 
  used to call me every name in the book and last, I was molested by my step-dad.</p>
<p>
  [21] Following the complainant's testimony, the Crown called three additional 
  witnesses, all of whom testified about prior complaints made by the appellant. 
  The complainant's former boyfriend, J.E., testified that, before being interviewed 
  by the police in November 1998, he had known the complainant for about three 
  months. He confirmed that he received the letter referred to in the complainant's 
  cross-examination sometime after meeting her. A former girlfriend of the complainant 
  testified that, approximately four years previously, she read a journal entry 
  written by the complainant indicating that the complainant's stepfather had 
  molested her at the campground. Finally, the woman who discovered the complainant's 
  diary explained that she was sorting through some material that the complainant 
  was discarding and became curious when she saw the word "sexual assault 
  ". She read the diary entry and then showed it to the complainant's father. 
  In cross-examination, she confirmed that the diary entry that she saw was dated 
  September 1, 1997. </p>
<p>
  iv) The defence </p>
<p>
  [22] Three witnesses testified for the defence: the appellant's sister, his 
  wife (the complainant's mother) and the appellant. The appellant's sister confirmed 
  that she was aware of the poor relationship between the complainant and the 
  complainant's mother when the complainant was about 13 or 14. She said that, 
  after being told about the complainant's first allegation, in order to prevent 
  further allegations, she suggested that the appellant not be alone with the 
  complainant.</p>
<p>
  [23] The complainant's mother described the complainant as demanding and self-centred. 
  She said that she and the complainant fought over the complainant's treatment 
  of her brother, her unwillingness to do chores, and about curfews at the campground. 
  She testified that at the age of 11 the complainant began expressing a desire 
  to live with her father.</p>
<p>
  [24] The complainant's mother also testified about the incident forming the 
  subject matter of the charges and how it came to her attention. She said that 
  she had a commitment in town on the evening in question. The complainant wanted 
  to stay home alone but was forced to go to the trailer. The next day, when the 
  family returned home, the complainant went about her usual activities until 
  about three o'clock in the afternoon when she approached her mother and said, 
  "mom, I have something to tell you &#133; dad felt me up last night ". 
  She testified that the complainant did not write her a note; she simply approached 
  her and told her. </p>
<p>
  [25] The complainant's mother said she telephoned the appellant and asked him 
  to come home immediately. He denied the incident and she accepted his version 
  of the events. In order to protect him from further allegations, the appellant 
  was never left alone in the house with the complainant and the complainant was 
  not allowed back at the campground.</p>
<p>
  [26] As for the second incident, the complainant's mother explained that she 
  permitted the complainant to go to the trailer because she (the mother) was 
  planning to be there. The complainant did not return to the trailer on time 
  for her curfew so her mother found her and summoned her home and also told her 
  that she had to baby-sit S. The complainant made the second allegation soon 
  after her parents returned to the trailer. The appellant went to kiss his son 
  goodnight and then went into the bathroom. He had been gone for three to four 
  minutes when the complainant yelled, "dad was dangling his dick in my face 
  for twenty minutes ".</p>
<p>
  [27] The complainant's mother said that after the second allegation the complainant 
  spent a lot of time with her father and that arrangements were made eventually 
  for her to move in with him. The complainant continued to visit her mother's 
  home regularly for a time, but the visits stopped after the police were called.</p>
<p>
  [28] The appellant testified and denied the allegations relating to both incidents 
  at the trailer. In addition, he was cross-examined about allegations that he 
  would expose himself to the complainant and masturbate in front of her. He described 
  those allegations as "totally false ".</p>
<p>
  [29] In closing submissions, defence counsel asserted that the complainant fabricated 
  the allegations as part of a pattern of alleging gross misconduct by her parents 
  at a time when the complainant was seeking more freedom and being put off in 
  her attempts to move in with her father. He relied on her motive to fabricate 
  and pattern of embellishment as giving rise to a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  II. The trial judge's reasons</p>
<p>
  [30] In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge rejected the appellant's testimony 
  and gave several reasons for accepting the complainant's evidence. His reasons 
  for accepting the complainant's testimony are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> Her mother &#133; also testified to the effect that she maintained 
  that [the complainant] was very difficult to handle. That she wanted more freedom 
  and would do anything to achieve it. The defence has attempted to portray [the 
  complainant] as a greatly troubled teenager, of a young person out of control. 
  Of a young lady only interested in partying with her peers and in particular 
  with young boys. The defence suggests that [the complainant] had ulterior motives 
  in making these accusations, namely, of making it impossible for her to continue 
  residing at the &#133; residence.</p>
<p class="indent">I find that such a proposition is not borne out by the evidence. 
  Indeed, if such had been her motive, she would not have visited her mother on 
  frequent weekends. According to her mother's own testimony, she would come home 
  almost every weekend. That, her room was kept for her. Certainly not actions 
  or behaviour consistent with someone who wished to sever the family bonds or 
  family ties.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, if she had such alternative motives, her allegation 
  of the second incident could have been embellished. It could have included touching 
  as opposed to merely exposing.</p>
<p class="indent">[The complainant's father's] testimony was to the effect that 
  [the complainant] never complained to him about how her mother treated her nor 
  did she make any adverse comments about the accused. On the other hand, [the 
  complainant's mother] and the accused attempted to cast the blame on [the complainant] 
  for her father's distress and emotional problems. They attempted to place the 
  entire blame on the complainant for the difficulties in the household as well 
  as her natural father's distress. The accused even suggested that the complainant 
  demonstrated this kind of rebellious behaviour at the age of one and a half.</p>
<p class="indent">The arrangement namely, making sure that the accused was no 
  longer to be alone with the complainant adds credence to the complainant's version 
  of events. Why such a precaution if nothing had happened? This after all, was 
  a first allegation.</p>
<p class="indent">I found the testimony of the complainant to be forthright and 
  credible. She demonstrated good recollection of matters of importance. Her description 
  of what transpired that evening never changed. She was cross-examined by able, 
  skilled and competent counsel. She remained firm as to what had transpired. 
  Her description of the assault was that the accused touched her vagina with 
  his hand. She did not present as someone who had rehearsed her testimony. I 
  find her evidence to be manifestly reliable.</p>
<p class="indent">[The complainant's mother], of course, was not present. She 
  is unable to corroborate what happened one way or the other. But, she has attempted 
  by her testimony to discredit and attack her daughter's character. The aunt, 
  that is the accused's sister, also attempted to describe the complainant as 
  having ulterior motives and as being uncontrollable.</p>
<p class="indent">[The complainant] was 12 years old at the time of this incident, 
  in August of 1996. The evidence is that the complainant is doing well in school. 
  That her behaviour at school was normal and that even now she is on the honour 
  roll. She was allowed to spend, according to her mother, just about every weekend 
  at the [family] residence after she moved with her father in Renfrew. Such evidence 
  is totally inconsistent with the suggestion that the complainant had ulterior 
  motives and was out of control. Also, inconsistent with the suggestion that 
  the complainant had to leave to protect the accused from further false accusations. 
  [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  III. Analysis</p>
<p>
  [31] While it was open to the trial judge to accept the complainant's evidence, 
  in doing so he failed to advert to important evidence relied on by the defence 
  and also advanced several reasons for accepting the complainant's evidence that 
  do not support his conclusion. In my view, the cumulative effect of these two 
  elements of his reasons gives rise to reversible error.</p>
<p>
  [32] First, the trial judge did not allude to the defence position that the 
  complainant's prior statements reflected a history of embellishment. Three aspects 
  of the evidence were capable of supporting this assertion: i) K.G.'s evidence 
  that she saw nothing on an occasion when the complainant claimed that the appellant 
  was "playing with himself " in the presence of both girls; ii) the 
  evidence of the allegations of mistreatment made by the complainant against 
  both parents in her letter to J.E. as contrasted to her trial evidence that 
  she got along "pretty good " with her mother; and iii) the complainant's 
  statement to her mother that the appellant waved his penis in her face for twenty 
  minutes, when her mother testified that the appellant had only been in the room 
  for a few minutes. </p>
<p>
  [33] While it was open to the trial judge to reject the assertion that the complainant 
  had embellished the first two complaints and to discount the significance of 
  the temporal embellishment in the third complaint, the defence assertion that 
  the complainant's prior statements reflected a history of embellishment was 
  an important element of the defence position. By failing to address that issue, 
  the trial judge disregarded important evidence and failed to respond to one 
  of the primary submissions of the defence. </p>
<p>
  [34] Second, in three instances, the trial judge advanced reasons for rejecting 
  the complainant's evidence that do not justify his conclusion and on one occasion 
  overstated the defence position in order to reject it. At page 10 of his reasons 
  the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Further, if she had such alternative motives, her allegation of the second incident 
  could have been embellished. It could have included touching as opposed to merely 
  exposing.</p>
<p>
  While the trial judge's statement that the complainant could have made a more 
  serious allegation if she had a motive to fabricate is undoubtedly correct, 
  it fails to address the fundamental question of whether the allegation as made 
  amounted to a fabrication.</p>
<p>
  [35] In addition, at page 11 of his reasons, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The arrangement namely, making sure that the accused was no longer to be alone 
  with the complainant ads credence to the complainant's version of events. Why 
  such a precaution if nothing had happened? This after all was a first allegation.</p>
<p>
  In my view, the arrangement can add credence to the complainant's allegations 
  only if the trial judge had already concluded that the allegations were true. 
  If one begins with the premise that the allegations could be either true or 
  false, the fact of the arrangement, standing alone, does not assist in assessing 
  their credibility.</p>
<p>
  [36] At page 12 of his reasons, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [The complainant] was 12 years old at the time of this incident, in August of 
  1996. The evidence is that the complainant is doing well in school. That her 
  behaviour at school was normal and that even now she is on the honour roll. 
  She was allowed to spend, according to her mother, just about every weekend 
  at the [family] residence after she moved with her father in Renfrew. Such evidence 
  is totally inconsistent with the suggestion that the complainant had ulterior 
  motives and was out of control. [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [37] Although there was clear evidence that the complainant was doing well in 
  school at the time of trial, there was no similar clarity concerning how she 
  was doing at the time of the incident forming the subject matter of the charges. 
  When asked to describe the complainant's academic abilities, her mother responded, 
  "[s]he has always been a good student even from grade one up to grade six 
  ". However, the complainant testified that, when the allegations were reported 
  to the Children's Aid Society, her marks were "really bad" and that 
  she was failing some classes. Considering the evidence as a whole, there was 
  no clear evidence of how the complainant was doing in school in August 1996. 
  Therefore it was not open to the trial judge to rely on her academic performance 
  as a basis for rejecting the position of the defence.</p>
<p>
  [38] Finally, in finding that the complainant's continued visits to her mother's 
  residence were not "actions or behaviour consistent with someone who wished 
  to sever the family bonds or family ties ", the trial judge overstated 
  the defence position as a means of rejecting it. The defence position was not 
  that the complainant wanted to sever all ties with her mother, but rather, simply 
  that she wanted to move in with her father. While it was certainly open to the 
  trial judge to consider the complainant's continued visits to her mother's home 
  in evaluating the defence position, the trial judge's characterization amounted 
  to an overstatement. Moreover, there was other evidence that may have affected 
  the assessment of the complainant's motive for continuing the visits, had the 
  trial judge stated the defence position correctly.</p>
<p>
  [39] In my view, none of these factors would be sufficient, on their own, to 
  justify ordering a new trial. However, considered as a whole, they undermine 
  the trial judge's </p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  reasons for accepting the complainant's evidence to a sufficient extent to warrant 
  ordering a new trial.</p>
<p>
  IV. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [40] Based on the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is 
  quashed and a new trial is ordered.</p>
