<p>On appeal from the order of Justice John D. Ground of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated August 13, 2002.</p>
<p>
  R.A. BLAIR J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This appeal involves a priority dispute over moveable property. It raises 
  issues about conflict of law principles where competing claims to such property 
  trigger different results under different provincial personal property security 
  regimes. Specifically, the appeal raises the following question: Do the choice 
  of law provisions found in s. 7(1) of the Personal Property Security Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. P.10, (the "Ontario PPSA"), apply in circumstances where, 
  because the instrument in question is not a financing lease, the Act is otherwise 
  inapplicable? In other words, must there be a security interest under Ontario 
  law before the choice of law provisions apply?</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [2] The contest in this case is between the lessor of seventy-five truck trailers 
  to a bankrupt company, on the one hand, and the bankrupt's financial lender 
  and its trustee in bankruptcy, on the other hand. The appellant, Xtra Canada, 
  is the lessor of the trailers. The bankrupt company is Tri-Line Expressways 
  Ltd. ("Expressways"), one of a group of subsidiaries of TCT Logistics 
  Inc. (TCT Logistics Inc. and its subsidiaries are bankrupt and in receivership). 
  The respondent, GMAC Commercial Finance Corporation - Canada ("GMAC"), 
  was the principal financier of the bankrupt group. To protect its advances it 
  held (amongst other things) a security interest over all the assets of Expressways 
  and registered that security interest under the Alberta Personal Property Security 
  Act R.S.A. 2000, c. P-7 (the "Alberta PPSA"). The respondent, KPMG 
  Inc., is the trustee in bankruptcy and interim receiver of the bankrupt group.</p>
<p>
  [3] Xtra's Canadian head offices are in Ontario. Although the trailers are licensed 
  in Ontario and delivery of them was taken in this province, they are in use 
  across the country. Expressways and the TCT Logistics group operated principally 
  out of Alberta and the trailers were garaged there.</p>
<p> [4] The Xtra lease is in the form of a Master Lease executed between Xtra 
  Canada and "Tri-Line Freight Systems" ("Freight Systems") in 1995<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a>. 
  Xtra did not register a financing statement under the Ontario PPSA because it 
  took the position that its lease was a true lease and that the lessor did not 
  have to register in Ontario in order to protect its interest as owner of the 
  trailers. It did register a financing statement against Freight Systems pursuant 
  to the Alberta PPSA, since a lease in whatever form is deemed to be a security 
  interest in that province and registration is required to protect the owner's 
  interest. </p>
<p>
  [5] The lessor under a true lease in which no security interest is created is 
  not obliged to register the lease under the Ontario PPSA and its ownership rights 
  will prevail in Ontario in a contest between the lessor and a trustee in bankruptcy 
  or a creditor such as GMAC: Crop &amp; Soil Service Inc. v. Oxford Leaseway 
  Ltd. (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 291 at 292 (C.A.). The parties accept that if Ontario 
  law applies, and provided the Master Lease is not a financing lease, Xtra will 
  prevail in the dispute. On the other hand, if the law of Alberta applies, Xtra 
  was required to register its deemed security interest under the Alberta PPSA, 
  and the dispute will be determined on priority of registration principles under 
  that legislation. </p>
<p> [6] There was an issue before the motions judge as to whether the Master Lease 
  was a true lease or a financing lease, as those terms are commonly employed 
  in personal property security jargon.<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> He 
  held it was the former and not the latter. Therefore, under s. 2,<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> 
  registration under the Ontario PPSA was not necessary in order to preserve the 
  appellant's ownership interest in the trailers, in competition with others claiming 
  a security interest in them under Ontario law. There was also an issue whether 
  the lease was in fact between Xtra and Freight Systems or between Xtra and Expressways. 
  The motions judge found the lease was between Xtra and Expressways.</p>
<p>
  [7] Although he found that the trailers were leased pursuant to a "true 
  lease", and that the Ontario PPSA therefore had no application for purposes 
  of preserving priorities in Ontario, the motions judge concluded, nonetheless, 
  that the choice of law provisions of the Ontario PPSA (s. 7) did apply to determine 
  the operative proper law for deciding the priority dispute between the parties. 
  Those provisions dictated that Alberta law applied. Under the Alberta PPSA, 
  unlike in Ontario, such a lease must be registered for the lessor to preserve 
  its priority claim. The appellant had registered its interest under the Alberta 
  PPSA, but against Freight Systems and not against Expressways, the appropriate 
  entity; accordingly the appellant's claim to priority over the claim of the 
  trustee in bankruptcy and the general secured creditor failed.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant argues the motions judge erred in concluding that Alberta 
  law governed the dispute, rather than Ontario law (which would see the trailers 
  returned to Xtra because of its prior right as owner). Specifically, the appellant 
  submits the motions judge erred in applying the choice of law provisions of 
  s. 7(1) of the Ontario PPSA, when that Act otherwise had no application because 
  of his finding that the lease was a true lease not requiring registration. Secondly, 
  the appellant contends that even if Alberta law does apply, the conclusion of 
  the motions judge that the lease was not registered against the correct party 
  cannot stand, since it is founded on an erroneous finding that the lease was 
  entered into between Xtra and Expressways rather than between Xtra and Freight 
  Systems.</p>
<p>
  [9] The respondents originally cross-appealed from the motion judge's decision 
  that the lease was a true lease. However, the cross-appeals were abandoned prior 
  to argument. </p>
<p>
  [10] I would dismiss the appeal for the reasons that follow.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  Choice of Law</p>
<p>
  [11] The primary issue for determination on this appeal is the choice of law 
  question.</p>
<p>
  [12] Before dealing with the primary issue, however, I will first address an 
  argument raised by the respondents. They now accept the motions judge's finding 
  that the Master Lease was a true lease and have dropped their cross-appeals 
  in that regard. They submit, however, that the motions judge erred in failing 
  to ask himself whether, in addition to being a true lease, it also served to 
  secure the payment or performance of an obligation: see Adelaide Capital Corp., 
  supra. In this regard they submit further that the Master Lease has the indicia 
  of a financing lease securing the payment or performance of an obligation, at 
  least for purposes of a "security interest" within the meaning of 
  s. 7(1) of the Ontario PPSA.</p>
<p>
  [13] I do not accept this argument. In the first place, I am satisfied that 
  the motions judge did direct his mind to whether the Master Lease was a financing 
  lease securing the payment or performance of an obligation. He found that it 
  was not. There was ample evidence on the record to support this finding, and 
  there is no basis for interfering with it. The respondents are simply trying 
  to re-argue the true lease/financing lease issue under a different guise. </p>
<p>
  [14] Secondly, the argument appears to be based on a misconception of the types 
  of leases that are caught or not caught by s. 2 of the Ontario PPSA. A lease 
  that is a true lease, in which no security interest is created, is not caught 
  by s. 2 and the lessor is not obliged to register a financing statement to protect 
  its interest in Ontario. A lease document that is not truly a lease, but merely 
  a cover for a financing transaction, is caught by s. 2, and registration is 
  required. Finally, a lease that is truly a lease but which has as well the characteristic 
  of securing payment or performance of an obligation, is also caught by s. 2, 
  and registration is required. These latter two types of instruments are generally 
  referred to as "financing leases". See Crop &amp; Soil Service Inc., 
  supra, and Adelaide Capital Corp., supra. The logical extension of the respondent's 
  submission, however, is the creation of a fourth category, namely a lease that 
  is a true lease and not a financial lease for purposes of s. 2, but is nonetheless 
  a lease that secures payment or performance of an obligation for purposes of 
  s. 7(1). No such category exists, in my opinion, and I would not give effect 
  to this argument.</p>
<p>
  [15] I turn, then, to the central issue on the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [16] Section 7(1) of the Ontario PPSA forms part of a series of provisions in 
  ss. 5 through 8 of the Act that deal with conflict of laws. The general rule 
  is that the validity, perfection and effect of perfection or non-perfection 
  of a security interest is governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the 
  collateral is situated at the time the security interest attaches. However, 
  in the case of intangibles or of equipment or inventory normally used in more 
  than one jurisdiction, the rule is different, namely the applicable is where 
  the debtor is located at the time of attachment. Section 7(1) provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) The validity, perfection and effect of perfection or non-perfection,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) of a security interest in,</p>
<p class="indent">(i) an intangible, or</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) goods that are of a type that are normally used in more 
  than one jurisdiction, if the goods are equipment or inventory leased or held 
  for lease by a debtor to others; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) of a non-possessory security interest in a security, an 
  instrument, a negotiable document of title, money and chattel paper,</p>
<p class="indent">shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the debtor 
  is located at the time the security interest attaches. </p>
<p>
  [17] Subparagraph 7(1)(a)(ii) is the pertinent provision for the purposes of 
  this proceeding. The trailers constitute equipment normally used in more than 
  one jurisdiction. The Alberta PPSA contains a similar provision dealing with 
  such goods, at subparagraph 7(2)(a)(ii).</p>
<p>
  [18] The motions judge stated his conclusion on the choice of law issue in the 
  following passage, at paragraph 26 of his reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  On the issue of the proper law, I have some difficulty understanding how Xtra 
  avoids the application of the provisions of both the Ontario PPSA and the Alberta 
  PPSA that the proper law to determine interests in rolling stock is the law 
  of the jurisdiction in which the lessee or debtor has its principal place of 
  business being, in the case at bar, Alberta. It seems to me to be beyond dispute 
  that, if a statute describes a proper law for the determination of interests 
  arising under a contract, one does not determine proper law by an analysis of 
  the connecting factors of the transaction as one would do if there was no statutory 
  provision applicable. Accordingly, I am of the view that the proper law for 
  the determination of the matters in dispute as between the Interim Receiver 
  and Xtra is the law of Alberta.</p>
<p>
  [19] I agree. In my view Ground J. was correct in holding that s. 7(1) of the 
  Ontario PPSA applied for choice of law purposes in the circumstances of this 
  case, even though the provisions of that Act were not applicable to require 
  registration of a financing statement concerning the Master Lease for preservation 
  of priority purposes in this province. I have reached this conclusion for a 
  number of reasons. </p>
<p>
  [20] First, the personal property security legislation in place in all the provinces 
  and territories, with the exception of the Yukon (and Quebec, which does not 
  have PPSA legislation), contains a choice of law stipulation similar to s. 7(1) 
  of the Ontario PPSA and s. 7(2) of the Alberta PPSA. The Legislatures in Canada 
  have thereby sent a clear signal that, where there are priority disputes over 
  equipment or inventory used in more than one jurisdiction, and claimants' interests 
  span more than one jurisdiction, the legislative intention is that those disputes 
  be determined pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction where the debtor or lessee 
  is located at the time the security interest attaches. Such an intention is 
  consistent with the purpose and objective of the personal property security 
  regimes enacted across the country, namely to promote certainty, uniformity 
  and clarity in the laws relating to inter-provincial commercial dealings and 
  to facilitate doing business in more than one jurisdiction: see Gimli Auto Ltd. 
  v. BDO Dunwoody Ltd. (1998), 219 A.R. 166 (Alta. C.A.); and Toronto-Dominion 
  Bank v. RNG Group Inc. (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 567 at 576 (S.C.J.). Principles 
  of comity as applied between provinces, and considerations of commercial stability 
  and certainty in a fluid trans-provincial economy, underlie such a policy and 
  support this conclusion. </p>
<p>
  [21] Secondly, the purposes of ss. 2 and 7 of the Ontario PPSA are quite different. 
  The role of s. 2 is to delineate the types of interests to which the Act has 
  application for purposes of registration and the preservation of priority in 
  Ontario. Section 7, on the other hand, has a broader reach. Its concerns are 
  with multi-jurisdictional disputes over goods that are normally used in one 
  or more provinces, and it must be interpreted in that context. Its role is to 
  clarify what proper law governs disputes involving the validity, perfection 
  and the effect of perfection or non-perfection of competing interests in such 
  a context. These functions are not irreconcilable in their separate operation. 
  Giving s. 7(1) an effect independent of s. 2 and broader in its scope is consistent 
  with the purposes and objects of the Act. Applying it in circumstances such 
  as this makes it clear - in conformity with the similar provisions of other 
  provincial statutes - that multi-jurisdictional disputes concerning moveable 
  equipment such as the trailers here in question will be resolved on the basis 
  of a standard premise across the country, that is, based upon the law of the 
  province where the debtor has its principal place of business. Predictability 
  is enhanced. Forum shopping is avoided.</p>
<p>
  [22] Where s. 7(1) is concerned, the first consideration is not to determine 
  whether the transaction under review created a security interest, as defined 
  in the Ontario PPSA. It is to determine whether the dispute gives rise to a 
  question regarding the validity, perfection or the effect of perfection or non-perfection 
  of a security interest in the relevant type of equipment or inventory, and, 
  if it does, then to apply the choice of law provisions to determine the proper 
  law governing the resolution of that dispute. In this context, "security 
  interest" is not confined to security interest as defined in the Ontario 
  PPSA.</p>
<p>
  [23] Thirdly, the language of s. 7(1) of the Ontario PPSA - and of the comparable 
  provision in the Alberta legislation - itself supports the foregoing interpretation 
  and objectives, in my view. From Xtra's perspective, the Master Lease may not 
  give rise to "a security interest", as defined by the Ontario PPSA. 
  However, each of GMAC and Xtra are making a claim to the trailers, and GMAC's 
  interest is a "security interest" as defined in both the Ontario and 
  Alberta PPSA's. In addition, Xtra claims a security interest in the trailers 
  under Alberta law. Thus the dispute at bar involves - in the words of s. 7(1)(a) 
  of the Ontario Act - "the &#133; perfection and effect of perfection or 
  non-perfection &#133; of a security interest in [equipment or inventory that 
  are normally used in more than one jurisdiction]". </p>
<p>
  [24] The language of s. 7(2) of the Ontario PPSA is instructive as well in this 
  regard. It states: </p>
<p class="indent"> 7(2) If a debtor changes location to Ontario, a perfected security 
  interest referred to in subsection (1) continues perfected in Ontario if it 
  is perfected in Ontario,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) within sixty days from the day the debtor changes location;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) within fifteen days from the day the secured party receives 
  notice that the debtor has changed location; or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) prior to the day that perfection ceases under the law of 
  the jurisdiction referred to in subsection (1),</p>
<p class="indent">whichever is the earliest. (emphasis added)</p>
<p>
  [25] In short, the "security interest" referred to in s. 7(1)(a) of 
  the Ontario PPSA is not confined to an Ontario security interest, as defined 
  in ss. 1(1) and 2(a) of the Act. The very purpose of s. 7(2) is to continue 
  a non-Ontario perfected security interest in Ontario when a debtor moves to 
  this province, and s. 7(2)(c) expressly contemplates security interests perfected 
  under the laws of other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>
  [26] Finally, the well-known principles of statutory construction buttress the 
  foregoing interpretation and approach. The overarching principle of statutory 
  interpretation is that the words of an Act are to be read purposively, in their 
  entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with 
  the scheme and object of the Act and the intention of the legislator: Rizzo 
  &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 at 41, citing Elmer Driedger, 
  Construction of Statutes, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983). In addition, 
  the Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.11, s. 10, makes it clear that in 
  reading the Ontario PPSA, the court is to give it: </p>
<p class="indent">
  such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure 
  the attainment of the object of the Act according to its true intent, meaning 
  and spirit.</p>
<p>
  [27] In my opinion, therefore, the choice of law provisions in the various provincial 
  and territorial statutes are expressly designed to catch the type of situation 
  arising in this case. There are competing claims to trailers that are normally 
  used in more than one province, but that have connections to both Ontario and 
  Alberta. One claimant, Xtra, has its head offices in Ontario, but also has offices 
  in Manitoba and accepted lease payments on the trailers at its offices in British 
  Columbia. Xtra has registered a financing statement claiming a security interest 
  in the trailers in Alberta. The secured claimant, GMAC, has registered its security 
  interest in Alberta, but not in Ontario. The bankrupt debtor company operates 
  principally out of Alberta and the trailers are garaged in Alberta. To avoid 
  the inconsistencies, and the potential forum shopping, that might result in 
  such circumstances from applying the law of the place where the dispute is adjudicated 
  (the lex fori), the PPSA'a across the country stipulate that such disputes are 
  to be governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the debtor is located at 
  the time the security interest attaches. This provides for uniformity, certainty 
  and clarity in the application of personal property security law across the 
  country.</p>
<p>
  [28] I would dismiss the appeal on the choice of law issue.</p>
<p>
  Registration under the Alberta PPSA and the Parties to the Lease</p>
<p>
  [29] Under Alberta law the lessor's interest in the Master Lease is deemed to 
  be a security interest and registration under the Alberta PPSA is required. 
  The appellant registered a financing statement, but not against the bankrupt, 
  Expressways. Consequently, the motions judge concluded that its interest in 
  the Master Lease is subordinate to that of GMAC, who had registered a financing 
  statement against Expressways, and against that of Expressways' trustee in bankruptcy. 
  </p>
<p>
  [30] Even if Alberta law applies, the appellant contends the motions judge erred 
  in concluding that the lease was not registered against the correct party. It 
  submits the conclusion is founded on an erroneous finding that the Master Lease 
  was entered into between Xtra and Expressways rather than between Xtra and Freight 
  Systems. I would not give effect to this argument.</p>
<p> [31] The motions judge found that even though the Master Lease on its face 
  purported to be between Xtra and Freight Systems, the real parties to the agreement 
  were in fact Xtra and Expressways. While there was evidence going both ways 
  on this issue, there was ample evidence to support the motions judge's finding. 
  Given that there was an evidentiary foundation for this conclusion, and given 
  as well the procedural frailties attaching to some of affidavits filed in support 
  of the appellant's claim, I see no basis for interfering with the finding made 
  by the motions judge.</p>
<p>
  Disposition</p>
<p>
  [32] For the foregoing reasons I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p>
  [33] The parties submitted draft bills of costs on a partial indemnity scale. 
  The respondents are entitled to their costs of the appeal fixed in the amount 
  of $9,500.00 each, inclusive of fees, disbursements and GST.</p>

<p><a name="a"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> Depending upon one&#146;s view of the 
  evidence, Freight Systems is either a trade name under which Expressways carried 
  on business or a partnership (perhaps long dissolved) of which Expressways was 
  a member. On the view I take of the appeal, it is not necessary to resolve this 
  issue.</p>
<p><a href="#2">[2]</a> The Ontario PPSA does not use either term. However, an 
  agreement that is truly a lease may also be required to be registered under 
  the Act if it &#147;has as well the characteristic of &#145;[securing] payment 
  or performance of an obligation&#146;&#148; (s. 2(a)(ii)): see Adelaide Capital

<p> </p>
<p><a href="#3">[3]</a> Section 2 states:</p>
<p>Subject to subsection 4(1), this Act applies to,</p>

  regard to the person who has title to the collateral that in substance creates 
  a security interest including, without limiting the foregoing,</p>
<p class="indent10">(i) a chattel mortgage, conditional sale, equipment trust, 
  debenture, floating charge, pledge, trust indenture or trust receipt, and</p>

<p class="indent">(b) a transfer of an account or chattel paper even though the 
  transfer maya not secure payment or performance of an obligation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Section 1(1) of the Act defines &#147;security interest&#148; to mean &#147;an 
  interest in personal property that secures payment or performance of an obligation, 
  and includes, whether or not the interest secures payment or performance of 
  an obligation, the interest of a transferee of an account or chattel paper.</p>
