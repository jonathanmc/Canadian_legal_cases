<p>On appeal from the order of Justice John D. Ground of the Superior Court of 
  Justice dated April 29, 2003.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] In this case, leave to appeal was granted under s. 193(e) of the Bankruptcy 
  and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the BIA), to allow this court to address 
  a significant issue of law: whether the bankruptcy court has the authority to 
  effectively immunize an interim receiver or a trustee in bankruptcy appointed 
  under the BIA, that operates the business of the debtor in order to sell it 
  as a going concern, from the obligations of a successor employer, by denying 
  a union leave to bring successor employer proceedings before the Ontario Labour 
  Relations Board (OLRB).</p>
<p>
  HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>[2] T.C.T. Logistics Inc. and related companies (collectively TCT) had operations 
  across Canada and the United States and were engaged in four principal industries: 
  trucking, high-tech, freight brokerage and warehousing. The warehousing business 
  involved the storage of freight on behalf of manufacturers, distributors and 
  retailers. One of the five warehousing facilities was located at 137 Horner 
  Avenue in Toronto, while others were in Alberta. The Industrial Wood and Allied 
  Workers of Canada, Local 700 (the Union) was the exclusive bargaining agent 
  for 70 employees at the Horner Avenue warehouse. TCT and the Union entered into 
  a collective agreement with respect to this warehouse, to run from May 1, 2000 
  to April 30, 2004.</p>
<p>
  [3] In January 2002, TCT became insolvent. GMAC Commercial Finance Corporation 
  - Canada (GMAC), the largest secured creditor of TCT, moved under s. 47 of the 
  BIA and s. 101 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 (the CJA) 
  for an order appointing KPMG Inc. as interim receiver over the assets of TCT. 
  The bankruptcy judge issued the order on January 24, 2002, granting the interim 
  receiver wide powers, subject to court supervision, to shut down and sell TCT's 
  businesses and to assign TCT into bankruptcy. The order set out the interim 
  receiver's powers in extensive detail. The following paragraphs of the order 
  are of particular importance for this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [4] Subparagraph 3(h) of the order stated that KPMG was empowered: </p>
<p class="indent">
  (h) to engage, retain and to discharge or terminate such agents, assistants 
  and employees of any of the Debtors as the Receiver may consider necessary or 
  desirable, provided that such employment shall not constitute the Receiver a 
  "successor employer" to any of the Debtors within the meaning of the 
  Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.2 or any other provincial or federal 
  statute or otherwise.</p>
<p>
  [5] Paragraph 8 of the Order stated that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  THIS COURT ORDERS that no actions or proceedings shall be commenced against 
  KPMG Inc. or the Receiver in any Court or other tribunal unless the leave of 
  this Honourable Court is first obtained on motion on at least seven (7) days 
  notice to the Receiver or KPMG Inc&#133;.</p>
<p>
  [6] Paragraph 15 of the Order stated that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  THIS COURT ORDERS that the employment of employees of the Debtors, including 
  employees on maternity leave, disability leave and all other forms of approved 
  absence is hereby terminated effective immediately prior to the appointment 
  of the Receiver. Notwithstanding the appointment of the Receiver or the exercise 
  of any of its powers or the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or the 
  use or employment by the Receiver of any person in connection with its appointment 
  and the performance of its powers and duties hereunder, the Receiver is not 
  and shall not be deemed or considered to be a successor employer, related employer, 
  sponsor or payer with respect to any of the employees of any of the Debtors 
  or any former employees within the meaning of the Labour Relations Act (Ontario), 
  the Employment Standards Act (Ontario), the Pension Benefits Act (Ontario), 
  Canada Labour Code, Pension Benefits Standards Act (Canada) or any other provincial, 
  federal, or municipal legislation or common law governing employment or labour 
  standards (the "labour laws") or any other statute, regulation or 
  rule of law or equity for any purpose whatsoever, or any collective agreement 
  or other contract between any of the Debtors and any of their present or former 
  employees, or otherwise. In particular, the Receiver shall not be liable to 
  any of the employees of any of the Debtors for any wages (as "wages" 
  are defined in the Employment Standards Act (Ontario)), including severance 
  pay, termination pay and vacation pay, except for such wages as the Receiver 
  may specifically agree to pay. The Receiver shall not be liable for an [sic] 
  contribution or other payment to any pension or benefit fund.</p>
<p>
  [7] Although the order was obtained without notice to the Union, after obtaining 
  the order and on the same day, January 24, 2002, KPMG sent a memo to the employees 
  of TCT which explained that KPMG had been appointed interim receiver of TCT 
  and that it intended "to continue operations in order to evaluate potential 
  sales of various lines of business." Although the letter did not mention 
  the status of the collective agreement, during the time it operated the business 
  KPMG did not contribute to any pension plans nor fund any arrears of vacation 
  pay. </p>
<p>
  [8] On February 22, 2002, KPMG brought a motion for an order authorizing it 
  to file an assignment in bankruptcy on behalf of TCT. On February 25, 2002, 
  as interim receiver and trustee in bankruptcy, KPMG met with the employees, 
  advised them of its intention to continue operations in order to evaluate potential 
  sales of the warehousing business and requested their support "to allow 
  us to maximize the enterprise value for all stakeholders." </p>
<p>
  [9] On April 12, 2002, KPMG entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Spectrum 
  Supply Chain Solutions Inc. (Spectrum) to sell the assets of TCT's warehousing 
  business. Spectrum purchased TCT's leasehold interests in three of the Alberta 
  locations but not in the Toronto Horner Avenue premises and in one of the Alberta 
  premises. KPMG determined that it had to wind down the operations at those two 
  locations and disclaim the leases. KPMG retained Spectrum to manage the wind 
  down. </p>
<p>
  [10] The Asset Purchase Agreement provided that KPMG would terminate all employees 
  prior to the closing of the transaction, and that Spectrum would only re-hire 
  certain specified employees. Spectrum is in the warehousing business. The president 
  of Spectrum is the former Vice-President, Warehousing and Logistics, of TCT. 
  Several of the warehouse managers of TCT became managers of Spectrum. Spectrum 
  set up operations at 6099 McLaughlin Road in Mississauga, Ontario, with essentially 
  the same customers that TCT had at the Horner Avenue warehouse. </p>
<p>
  [11] On April 16, 2002, KPMG met with employees working at the Horner Avenue 
  warehouse facility and informed them of the sale and its intention to seek court 
  approval of the sale on April 18, 2002. On May 9, 2002, KPMG terminated all 
  unionized employees at the Horner Avenue location. Some of those employees were 
  later hired by Spectrum, without regard to the Union seniority list, to work 
  at the McLaughlin Road warehouse in Mississauga. </p>
<p>
  [12] On May 13, 2002, without first seeking leave from the bankruptcy court, 
  the Union filed three applications with the OLRB for the following relief: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) a declaration that Spectrum is the successor employer to 
  TCT and /or KPMG pursuant to s. 69 of the Ontario Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. L. 2 (the LRA) and is therefore bound by the collective agreement between 
  the Union and TCT;</p>
<p class="indent">(2) a declaration that TCT and Spectrum are a single employer 
  for the purposes of labour relations pursuant to s. 1(4) of the LRA;</p>
<p class="indent">(3) a declaration of unfair labour practice under s. 96 of the 
  LRA and damages against TCT and/or KPMG and Spectrum for entering into a sale 
  agreement that discriminates against unionized employees and eliminates the 
  Union; and</p>
<p class="indent">(4) an order for the certification of the Union as the exclusive 
  bargaining agent for the employees of Spectrum. </p>
<p>
  [13] In its applications, the Union alleged that Spectrum was incorporated for 
  the sole purpose of acquiring TCT's warehousing assets and that the Asset Purchase 
  Agreement entered into by Spectrum and KPMG was negotiated so as to oust the 
  Union and allow Spectrum to operate TCT's warehousing business in Toronto under 
  substantially the same management but without a union.</p>
<p>
  [14] In response to the Union's applications, KPMG brought a motion before the 
  OLRB to stay the proceedings in which it was named, on the basis that under 
  paragraph 8 of the January 24, 2002 order and s. 215 of the BIA, the Union was 
  precluded from proceeding against KPMG without leave of the court. The OLRB 
  granted the stay on August 27, 2002: Spectrum Supply Chain Solutions Inc., [2002] 
  O.L.R.D. No. 2866.</p>
<p>
  [15] The Union then moved on October 24, 2002, in the bankruptcy court: (1) 
  for an order deleting certain provisions of the January 24, 2002 order, including 
  the parts of subparagraph 3(h) and paragraph 15 that provided that KPMG was 
  not and could not be deemed a successor employer; and (2) for leave to proceed 
  before the OLRB. </p>
<p>
  [16] By order dated April 29, 2003, the bankruptcy judge amended the paragraphs 
  of the original order that provided that KPMG could not be deemed a successor 
  employer, and modified them to protect KPMG as long as it was acting "qua 
  realizer" of the assets. He then denied the Union leave to commence successor 
  employer proceedings before the OLRB against KPMG, on the basis that, in accordance 
  with the amended order, KPMG had in fact acted "qua realizer", and 
  not as a successor employer in its administration of the TCT bankruptcy and 
  interim receivership.</p>
<p>
  [17] The bankruptcy judge also considered other factors that militated against 
  the granting of leave. He found that the receiver did not mislead the employees 
  on the terms of their hiring, that the receiver had acted expeditiously in operating 
  the business to effect a sale that was approved by the court, and that the actions 
  of the receiver had been approved by the court without any objection by the 
  Union, although the employees had been told about the sale and about the date 
  for the court approval of the sale. Most importantly, the business had been 
  sold to Spectrum and the Union was proceeding before the OLRB to have Spectrum 
  declared a successor employer.</p>
<p>
  [18] On December 18, 2003, this court granted the Union leave under s. 193(e) 
  of the BIA to appeal the order of the bankruptcy judge.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES </p>
<p>
  (1) Did the bankruptcy judge have jurisdiction under s. 47(2) or under s. 215 
  of the BIA to deny the Union leave to apply to the OLRB for a declaration that 
  the interim receiver and trustee became a successor employer to TCT and was 
  therefore bound by the collective agreement?</p>
<p>
  (2) If the bankruptcy judge had jurisdiction, did he err in the exercise of 
  his discretion by denying leave?</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  Issue 1: The jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to deny leave under s. 215 
  of the BIA</p>
<p>
  A. The current state of the law</p>
<p>
  [19] Recent caselaw reflects the practical and legal tension between the roles 
  and jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and the labour board when a business 
  plummets into financial trouble and creditors seek to extricate the business 
  from its problems and maximize the value for all stakeholders. Where there are 
  unionized employees subject to a collective agreement, and the receiver or trustee 
  operates the business on an interim basis in order to sell the business as a 
  going concern, both the receiver or trustee and the employees want to know the 
  nature of the receiver's obligations to the employees in terms of wages, pension 
  contributions, vacation pay, termination pay, grievances, seniority, etc. The 
  underlying question, of course, is whether the receiver or trustee is bound 
  by the collective agreement.</p>
<p>
  [20] In this context, courts across Canada have been faced with many issues 
  including: the status of employees upon bankruptcy, the status of a collective 
  agreement upon bankruptcy, and whether a receiver or trustee that operates a 
  debtor's business can or should become a successor employer with the sometimes 
  potentially significant personal liabilities that can attach to that status. 
  Bankruptcy courts have had to resolve how to address these issues under their 
  statutory mandate and in the face of provincial legislation that gives exclusive 
  jurisdiction over the determination of successor employer status to provincial 
  labour relations boards. See for example, Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd., [1998] 
  1 S.C.R. 27 (the employment of all employees is terminated on bankruptcy); St 
  Marys Paper Inc. (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 163 (C.A.) (the trustee in bankruptcy 
  that operated the business was an employer under the Pension Benefits Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. P. 8 (the PBA) and therefore was obliged to make all required pension 
  contributions to the employees' pension plans; Abella J.A. in dissent stated 
  that contracts of employment including collective agreements terminate with 
  bankruptcy); Re 588871 Ontario Ltd. (1995), 33 C.B.R. (3d) 28 (Ont. Gen Div.) 
  (the collective agreement terminates on bankruptcy); Associated Freezer of Canada 
  Inc. (Trustee of) v. Retail Wholesale Canada, Local 1015 (1996), 151 N.S.R. 
  (2d) 376 (C.A.), aff'g (1995), 149 N.S.R. (2d) 385 (S.C.) (in obiter: the collective 
  agreement terminates on bankruptcy); Re Royal Oak Mines (2001), 143 O.A.C. 75 
  (the receiver was not required to make pension contributions because the order 
  appointing it said that it was not the employer: it was not appointed to operate 
  the mine, which operation was continued by the debtor); Saan Stores Ltd. v. 
  United Steelworkers of America, Local 596 (Retail Wholesale Canada, Canadian 
  Service Section Division) (1999), 173 N.S.R. (2d) 222 at para. 64 (C.A.) (although 
  employment terminates on bankruptcy, "the employment and the collective 
  agreement were not terminated for all purposes"; the successor employer 
  obligations on a purchaser of the debtor's business are statutory and unaffected 
  by the termination of the employment relationship between the debtor and its 
  employees); and Syndicat national de l'amiante d'Asbestos Inc. v. Jeffrey Mines 
  Inc., [2003] R.J.Q. No. 420 (C.A.) (a monitor appointed under the Companies' 
  Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 (the CCAA) but, like an interim 
  receiver, given control over the debtor's property and the authority to carry 
  on its business, is bound to abide by the terms of the collective agreement 
  where there is a certified union in the workplace).</p>
<p>
  [21] In light of the difficulties and inconsistencies in the developing jurisprudence, 
  leave to appeal the decision of the bankruptcy judge in this case was granted 
  under s. 193(e) of the BIA, to give this court the opportunity to address the 
  issue of the bankruptcy court's jurisdiction under the BIA to deal with the 
  successor employer status of an interim receiver and trustee in bankruptcy.</p>
<p>
  B. The jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court under s. 47(2) of the BIA</p>
<p>
  [22] Section 47 of the BIA provides as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 47. (1) Where the court is satisfied that a notice is about 
  to be sent or has been sent under subsection 244(1), the court may, subject 
  to subsection (3), appoint a trustee as interim receiver of all or any part 
  of the debtor's property that is subject to the security to which the notice 
  relates, for such term as the court may determine. </p>
<p class="indent">(2) The court may direct an interim receiver appointed under 
  subsection (1) to do any or all of the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) take possession of all or part of the debtor's property 
  mentioned in the appointment;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) exercise such control over that property, and over the debtor's 
  business, as the court considers advisable; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) take such other action as the court considers advisable.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) An appointment of an interim receiver may be made under 
  subsection (1) only if it is shown to the court to be necessary for the protection 
  of</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the debtor's estate; or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the interests of the creditor who sent the notice under 
  subsection 244(1).<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> </p>
<p>[23] This section gives the bankruptcy court very broad authority to direct 
  an interim receiver to take action, including whatever power and authority it 
  may need to take possession of and exercise control over the debtor's property 
  and to "take such other action as the court considers advisable." 
  In this context, the question that arises is whether the ability to grant a 
  power also includes the authority to deem the actions taken by an interim receiver 
  pursuant to that power to have an effect in law that may be contrary to a provincial 
  statute. In particular, is the language of s. 47(2) broad enough to give the 
  bankruptcy court the power to deem that the conduct of an interim receiver will 
  not make it a successor employer under the LRA? </p>
<p>
  [24] Typically, the original order appointing an interim receiver under s. 47 
  of the BIA may include a clause similar to paragraph 15 of the original order 
  in this case, providing that if the receiver carries on the business of the 
  debtor and engages employees to do so, the receiver will not be deemed a successor 
  employer under the LRA and subject to the collective agreement between the debtor 
  company and the union. </p>
<p>
  [25] The propriety of such clauses in a s. 47 order has recently been questioned. 
  In Re Big Sky Living Inc., [2002] ABQB 659, the Alberta court was asked to approve 
  an ex parte order appointing an interim receiver. The order included many typically 
  sought standard clauses granting the receiver not only necessary powers to operate 
  or dispose of the debtor's business, but also broad powers, exemptions and immunities 
  that the receiver may or may not have needed and that could have affected the 
  rights of persons not before the court, including employees of the debtor. The 
  court commented that this boiler-plate form of order was too broadly worded 
  at the initial stage of the receivership and sent the parties back to redraft 
  it, omitting unnecessary powers and immunities until the needs of the receiver 
  were clear and notice could be given to potentially affected persons.</p>
<p>
  [26] A similar sentiment was expressed by Farley J. in Re Royal Crest Lifecare 
  Group Inc. (2003), 40 C.B.R. (4th) 146 (Ont. S.C.), aff'd [2004] O.J. No. 174 
  (C.A.). He was asked first, by the trustee in bankruptcy, to include in an order 
  a grant of up-front immunity from becoming a successor employer while operating 
  the business with a view to sale, and second, by the union, to grant leave to 
  commence proceedings before the OLRB to declare the trustee a successor employer. 
  Farley J. denied the union's motion for leave as premature, a decision that 
  was upheld on appeal. However, he also declined to include a provision for successor 
  employer immunity as part of the initial order, indicating that the order might 
  be modified later and that in the meantime, the trustee would have to work with 
  the union regarding demands for the payment of union dues, pension contributions 
  and a grievance procedure.</p>
<p> [27] The concerns expressed by these courts are particularly significant when 
  considered in light of the provisions of the LRA<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> 
  that deal with the sale of a business that is governed by a collective agreement. 
  These provisions alter the common law notion of privity of contract as between 
  an employer and employee and provide that where such a business is sold, the 
  purchaser is bound by the collective agreement: G. W. Adams, Canadian Labour 
  Law, 2nd ed. (Canada Law Book Inc: Aurora, June 2003) (loose leaf) at 8.10. 
  Section 69(2) of that Act defines when a person becomes a successor employer, 
  and ss. 69(12), 114(1) and 116 provide that the OLRB has the exclusive jurisdiction 
  to decide whether a person is a successor employer: </p>
<p class="indent"> 69(1) In this section&#133; "sells" includes leases, transfers 
  and any other manner of disposition, and "sold' and "sale' have corresponding 
  meanings.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where an employer who is bound by or is a party to a collective 
  agreement with a trade union or council of trade unions sells his, her or its 
  business, the person to whom the business has been sold is, until the Board 
  otherwise declares, bound by the collective agreement as if the person had been 
  a party thereto and, where an employer sells his, her or its business while 
  an application for certification or termination of bargaining rights to which 
  the employer is a party is before the Board, the person to whom the business 
  has been sold is, until the Board otherwise declares, the employer for the purposes 
  of the application as if the person were named as the employer in the application.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">(12) Where, on any application under this section or in any 
  other proceeding before the Board, a question arises as to whether a business 
  has been sold by one employer to another, the Board shall determine the question 
  and its decision is final and conclusive for the purposes of this Act.</p>
<p class="indent">114. (1) The Board has exclusive jurisdiction to exercise the 
  powers conferred upon it by or under this Act and to determine all questions 
  of fact or law that arise in any matter before it, and the action or decision 
  of the Board thereon is final and conclusive for all purposes, but nevertheless 
  the Board may at any time, if it considers it advisable to do so, reconsider 
  any decision, order, direction, declaration or ruling made by it and vary or 
  revoke any such decision, order, direction, declaration or ruling.</p>
<p class="indent">116. No decision, order, direction, declaration or ruling of 
  the Board shall be questioned or reviewed in any court, and no order shall be 
  made or process entered, or proceedings taken in any court, whether by way of 
  injunction, declaratory judgment, certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, 
  or otherwise, to question, review, prohibit or restrain the Board or any of 
  its proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [28] The term "successor employer" refers to a status under the LRA. 
  It is clear that ss. 69(12) and 114(1) of the LRA give the OLRB the unequivocal, 
  exclusive jurisdiction to decide the issue of successor employer for labour 
  relations purposes in every case. Section 47(2) of the BIA gives the bankruptcy 
  court the authority to direct the interim receiver to take possession and exercise 
  control over property, and to take other actions. There is no language in s. 
  47(2) that directly authorizes the court to deem that actions taken by the receiver 
  will not make it a successor employer or not have any other effect mandated 
  by applicable law. </p>
<p>
  [29] Furthermore, section 72 of the BIA provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  72(1) The provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to abrogate or supercede 
  the substantive provisions of any other law or statute relating to property 
  and civil rights that are not in conflict with this Act, and the trustee is 
  entitled to avail himself of all rights and remedies provided by that law or 
  statute as supplementary to and in addition to the rights and remedies provided 
  by this Act.</p>
<p>
  [30] Read as a whole, this section appears to be targeted at ensuring that in 
  the conduct of its duties, a trustee can use both provincial as well as bankruptcy 
  laws that may appear to overlap or serve similar purposes, such as, for example, 
  for attacking preferences: see Robinson v. Countrywide Factors Ltd., [1978] 
  1 S.C.R. 753. However, the first half of the section clearly states that the 
  BIA will not abrogate or supercede any provincial law unless that law is in 
  conflict with the BIA. The language of s. 47(2) of the BIA does not conflict 
  with the successor employer sections of the LRA and therefore does not abrogate 
  or supercede that Act.</p>
<p>
  [31] Furthermore, s. 47(2) must be read in the context of the entire BIA, including 
  s. 14.06(1.2). That section specifically protects an interim receiver and trustee 
  that carries on the business of the debtor, from inheriting any obligations 
  of the debtor that arose prior to the bankruptcy or receivership, including 
  obligations that would have arisen under federal or provincial law. Sections 
  14.06(1.1) and (1.2) provide: </p>
<p class="indent"> 14.06 (1.1) In subsections (1.2) to (6), a reference to a trustee 
  means a trustee in a bankruptcy or proposal and includes an interim receiver 
  or a receiver within the meaning of subsection 243(2).</p>
<p class="indent">14.06 (1.2) Notwithstanding anything in any federal or provincial 
  law, where a trustee carries on in that position the business of the debtor 
  or continues the employment of the debtor's employees, the trustee is not by 
  reason of that fact personally liable in respect of any claim against the debtor 
  or related to a requirement imposed on the debtor to pay an amount where the 
  claim arose before or upon the trustee's appointment.</p>
<p>
  [32] Section 14.06(1.2) was enacted in 1997 in response to this court's decision 
  in St. Marys Paper, supra, where the majority held that the trustee had become 
  an employer within the meaning of the PBA and, as such, was obliged under that 
  Act to make all payments that the debtor, as previous employer, had failed to 
  make. Section 14.06(1.2) protects a trustee or receiver that operates the business 
  of a debtor and has become an employer from responsibility for making good the 
  defaults of the debtor. However, the section is silent on any obligations that 
  the trustee or receiver may incur on a go-forward basis that are unrelated to 
  a claim against the debtor or a requirement imposed on the debtor, including 
  as a possible successor employer under the LRA.</p>
<p>
  [33] Read together, ss. 14.06(1.2) and 47(2) suggest that without anything further, 
  a trustee or receiver that is granted the authority to carry on the business 
  of the debtor, may potentially incur obligations under federal and provincial 
  laws, including as a successor employer, but only for obligations incurred after 
  the date of the bankruptcy or receivership. I conclude that on its own, s. 47(2) 
  does not give the bankruptcy court the authority to make a determination that 
  an interim receiver that operates the business of the debtor will not be a successor 
  employer under the LRA.</p>
<p>
  [34] In light of this conclusion, the portion of paragraph 15 of the receivership 
  order, as amended by the bankruptcy judge, that provides that the receiver's 
  actions in operating TCT's business if it acts "qua realizer" will 
  not make it a successor employer, is not authorized by s. 47(2). Accordingly, 
  it cannot stand.</p>
<p>
  C. The jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to deny leave under s. 215 of the 
  BIA</p>
<p>
  [35] However, s. 47(2) on its own does not determine the scope of the bankruptcy 
  judge's authority to shield an interim receiver. It is s. 215 of the BIA that 
  gives the bankruptcy court a gatekeeper function, requiring it to grant leave 
  before any action can be taken against a trustee or interim receiver "with 
  respect to&#133;any action taken pursuant to, this Act." It provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  215. Except by leave of the court, no action lies against the Superintendent, 
  an official receiver, an interim receiver or a trustee with respect to any report 
  made under, or any action taken pursuant to, this Act.</p>
<p>
  [36] As a result, besides acting with the authority of the court and as officers 
  of the court, when trustees and interim receivers carry out their duties in 
  accordance with the authority granted to them by the bankruptcy court, the bankruptcy 
  court is required to screen any actions that third parties may wish to take 
  against them and only grant leave in appropriate circumstances. Further protection 
  is provided to trustees in bankruptcy by s. 37 of the BIA, which allows a person 
  aggrieved by an act of the trustee to apply to the bankruptcy court for a remedy, 
  including reversal or modification of the trustee's act or decision. These provisions 
  are part of the scheme provided by the BIA to allow the bankruptcy court to 
  fully supervise bankruptcy and receivership regimes. </p>
<p>
  [37] For a business debtor, a bankruptcy or interim receivership can be an equally 
  cataclysmic event for the owners, creditors and employees. It is critical that 
  the situation be handled in the most controlled and orderly fashion by the interim 
  receiver or trustee under the supervision of the bankruptcy court in order to 
  address fairly the interests of every affected party and group and to achieve 
  the best outcome for all concerned. In order to do that most effectively, Parliament 
  has given the bankruptcy court complete control over the proceedings and over 
  its officers who administer insolvent estates.</p>
<p>
  [38] The Supreme Court of Canada recently focused on Parliament's legislative 
  policy of "single control" in the context of: (a) a bankruptcy that 
  affected parties in more than one province, and (b) a proposed action that was 
  arguably within the jurisdiction of the civil courts as opposed to the bankruptcy 
  court. In Sam L&eacute;vy &amp; Associ&eacute;s Inc. v. Azco Mining Inc., [2001] 
  3 S.C.R. 978 at para. 26, Binnie J. referred to the winding-up case of Dominion 
  Trust Co. (liquidator of) v. LePage (1916), 53 S.C.R. 337 (also referred to 
  as Stewart v. LePage) where the court held that it was the policy of Parliament 
  in a winding-up that one court control not only the assets and property of the 
  company in liquidation, but all of its litigation as well. Binnie J. then said 
  at para. 27: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Stewart was, as stated, a winding-up case, but the legislative policy in favour 
  of "single control" applies as well to bankruptcy. There is the same 
  public interest in the expeditious, efficient and economical clean-up of the 
  aftermath of a financial collapse. Section 188(1) [enforceability of bankruptcy 
  court orders across Canada] ensures that orders made by a bankruptcy court sitting 
  in one province can and will be enforced across the country (bracketed words 
  added).</p>
<p>
  [39] Section 215 is an integral part of the legislative policy that vests control 
  of the entire bankruptcy or receivership in the bankruptcy court. It is for 
  that court to determine the propriety of any proposed proceedings against the 
  interim receiver or trustee. With respect to the expertise of the bankruptcy 
  judge, MacPherson J.A. recently stated in Royal Crest at paras. 21-22: </p>
<p class="indent"> A bankruptcy is a disaster. A company has failed; in many cases 
  it will not survive. Creditors, who provided goods and services in good faith, 
  may lose substantial sums of money. Employees of the bankrupt company instantly 
  lose their jobs.</p>
<p class="indent">The bankruptcy judge is thrown into the middle of the disaster. 
  The judge will need to make important decisions that will affect the future 
  of the company, creditors and employees. The qualities of a good bankruptcy 
  judge are therefore expertise, sensitivity and speed.</p>
<p>
  [40] These qualities have been developed by bankruptcy courts across the country 
  in the course of the administration of innumerable bankruptcies and interim 
  receiverships, as well as the related procedures under the CCAA. These skills 
  and expertise are the necessary corollary of the legislative policy that the 
  bankruptcy court controls the full conduct and administration carried out by 
  receivers and trustees of the affected estates.</p>
<p>
  [41] The supervisory role of the bankruptcy court has been recognized by the 
  OLRB. It is instructive to observe one expert tribunal, the OLRB, emphasizing 
  the importance of and deferring to the expertise of another expert body, the 
  bankruptcy court, in insolvency matters. The OLRB has made its comments in the 
  context of deferring to the bankruptcy court for its leave before entertaining 
  successor employer applications relating to trustees and interim receivers. 
  For example, in Page Flooring Enterprises Inc., [2002] O.L.R.D. No. 4262, the 
  union applied to the OLRB for a declaration that there had been a sale of a 
  business by a trustee in bankruptcy. In declining to hear the application because 
  the union had not first obtained leave from the bankruptcy court, the OLRB stated 
  at para. 12: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In the Board's view, it is appropriate to be cautious and where there is doubt, 
  err on the side of respecting the stay provisions in the BIA. As the cases illustrate, 
  the goal of the stay proceedings of the BIA is to permit the court to exercise 
  its supervisory powers over the estate of the bankrupt and realize on the assets 
  for the benefit of the creditors. By declining to proceed, the Board is not 
  preventing the applicant from continuing its action. Instead, the Board is inviting 
  the applicant to go to the commercial court and seek its permission to proceed 
  before the Board. In that way, the court can, presumably, determine whether 
  proceeding with these matters before the Board will undermine the purpose of 
  the BIA in these circumstances, or not.</p>
<p>
  [42] The OLRB's decision in the present case not to hear the Union's successor 
  employer application without leave of the bankruptcy court, is another illustration 
  of the deference of the OLRB to the role and expertise of the bankruptcy court. 
  In Spectrum Supply Chain, supra, the OLRB stated at para. 21: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The Court has an inherent supervisory and statutory jurisdiction over the preservation 
  and realization of debtors' assets. Leave of the Court must be sought to ensure 
  fairness and order in the insolvency process and to avoid a multiplicity in 
  proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [43] These observations concerning the purpose and effect of s. 215 are consistent 
  with the contextual and purposive approach to statutory interpretation approved 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada based on Driedger's formulation in The Construction 
  of Statutes (Toronto: Butterworths, 1974) at 67: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are 
  to be read in their entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense 
  harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention 
  of Parliament.</p>
<p>See Rizzo Shoes, supra, at paras. 21-23 and Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership 
  v. Rex, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 26. Section 215 is a fundamental part of 
  Parliament's legislative scheme in the BIA for the regulation of bankruptcies 
  and receiverships in Canada. That scheme vests control of the entire process 
  in the bankruptcy court, allowing it to ensure that the trustee and interim 
  receiver can carry out their duties with fairness and necessary speed, while 
  balancing the interests of all those with a stake in the outcome.</p>
<p>
  D. The granting of leave under s. 215 of the BIA</p>
<p>
  [44] Historically, the test for granting leave under s. 215 has developed in 
  the context of parties seeking to sue a trustee for alleged acts of malfeasance, 
  such as torts or fraud. In that context, the courts determined that in order 
  to grant leave to commence proceedings, it was necessary to ensure that there 
  was a cause of action against the trustee and a factual foundation for the claim 
  that was not frivolous or vexatious. The test was not so stringent, however, 
  as to require a demonstration that the case would be made out. The threshold 
  for leave has been characterized as a low one: see Mancini (Trustee of) v. Falconi 
  (1993), 61 O.A.C. 332 and Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers 
  of Canada v. Armitage (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 688 (C.A.). However, where the conduct 
  complained of had already been approved by the court, Blair J. held that the 
  threshold should be the higher one of "strong prima facie case": Bank 
  of America Canada v. Willann Investments Ltd.(1993), 23 C.B.R. (3d) 98 at paras. 
  9-10 (Ont. Gen. Div.). He observed that otherwise, there would be little point 
  in the receiver obtaining the approval of the court for its actions as that 
  approval would provide little protection.</p>
<p>
  [45] However, even on application of the strong prima facie case standard, if 
  the only issue is whether there is a factual basis for the OLRB to declare the 
  receiver a successor employer, the bankruptcy court could have a difficult time 
  denying leave in most cases where the receiver is operating the business with 
  employees. This is because the caselaw on the meaning of the 'sale' of a business 
  has emphasized the very broad interpretation to be given to that concept for 
  the purpose of successor employer status. In W.W. Lester (1978) Ltd. v. United 
  Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry, 
  Local 740, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 644 at para. 64, which concerned a Newfoundland statutory 
  sale provision similar to that contained in the LRA, McLachlin J. (as she then 
  was) stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In keeping with the purpose of successorship provisions -- to protect the permanence 
  of bargaining rights -- labour boards have interpreted "disposition" 
  broadly to include almost any mode of transfer and have not relied on technical 
  legal forms of business transactions. As explained by the Ontario Board in United 
  Steelworkers of America v. Thorco Manufacturing Ltd. (1965), 65 CLLC para 16,052, 
  an expansive definition accords with the purpose of the section -- to preserve 
  bargaining rights regardless of the legal form of the transaction which puts 
  bargaining rights in jeopardy.</p>
<p>
  [46] Furthermore, a number of labour board and court decisions have held that 
  where a receiver or trustee carries on the business of the debtor, that conduct 
  can amount to a sale of a business under s. 69(2) of the LRA: see H. &amp; S. 
  Reliance, [1998] O.L.R.D. No. 4087; Deloitte &amp; Touche, [1993] O.L.R.D. No. 
  458; Maritime Life Assurance Co. v. Chateau Gardens (Hanover) Inc. (1983), 43 
  O.R. (2d) 754 (Ont. H.C.J.). For example, in Deloitte &amp; Touche, Deloitte 
  was appointed by the court as receiver and manager of an Ottawa nursing home. 
  The receiver operated the nursing home but refused to bargain with the union 
  or to adhere to the terms of the collective agreement. The case report notes 
  that the OLRB application proceeded without leave of the bankruptcy court based 
  on a concession by counsel for the receiver. The OLRB concluded that for labour 
  relations purposes, if not for commercial purposes, the operation of the business 
  by the receiver constituted a sale within the meaning of the LRA. The receiver 
  was the employer of the employees, and it exercised control over the business. 
  The fact that its operation of the business was to be for a limited period only, 
  pending sale, did not preclude a finding of successorship.</p>
<p>
  E. The status of a collective agreement upon bankruptcy</p>
<p>
  [47] In spite of this caselaw, some bankruptcy courts have nevertheless refused 
  to grant leave to a union to proceed before the OLRB for a successor employer 
  declaration on the basis, in part, that as a matter of bankruptcy law, collective 
  agreements terminate with bankruptcy. As a result, these courts have held that 
  they ought not to grant leave for a proceeding to be brought before the OLRB 
  where a finding could be made in that proceeding that was contrary to bankruptcy 
  law: see for example, 588871 Ontario Ltd., supra, and Associated Freezer, supra.</p>
<p>
  [48] The proposition that a collective agreement is a contract that terminates 
  upon bankruptcy was first stated in the following way in dissenting reasons 
  by Abella J.A. in St. Marys Paper, supra, at p. 181: "contracts of employment 
  with employees, including collective agreements, terminate with a bankruptcy" 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [49] As stated, to the extent that an employee's contract of employment with 
  a bankrupt employer is contained in a collective agreement, the employee's contract 
  is terminated on bankruptcy. This does not mean, however, that a collective 
  agreement is terminated for all purposes upon bankruptcy; nor do I understand 
  Abella J.A.'s quoted statement, properly understood, to necessarily indicate 
  such a legal result. </p>
<p>
  [50] The status of a collective agreement is governed by the LRA and is only 
  terminated in specific circumstances set out under that Act, such as abandonment 
  (s. 63(17)), fraud (s. 64(1)) or failure to bargain (s. 65(2)). Upon the sale 
  of a business by an interim receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, the OLRB may 
  declare that the purchaser is a successor employer and bound by the collective 
  agreement that was in place between the debtor and the union: Vulcan Containers 
  Ltd., [1997] OLRB Rep. July/August 765. </p>
<p>
  [51] Also, recent appellate cases from Nova Scotia and Quebec have recognized 
  that a collective agreement is not terminated following bankruptcy or interim 
  receivership: Saan Stores, supra; Jeffrey Mines, supra. I agree.</p>
<p>
  F. The scope of the test to be applied under s. 215 of the BIA</p>
<p>
  [52] As I have said, since a collective agreement is not terminated on bankruptcy, 
  and the jurisprudence holds that a receiver that carries on the business of 
  the debtor can be a successor employer, in many cases the bankruptcy court would 
  have little basis to deny leave to proceed on a s. 215 application if its only 
  role was to determine if there are facts that could allow the OLRB to declare 
  the receiver a successor employer.</p>
<p>
  [53] The scope of the bankruptcy court's proper inquiry under s. 215, however, 
  is not so limited. As the labour board has recognized (as discussed in para. 
  41 above), a fundamental issue that the bankruptcy court must be able to address 
  when considering whether to grant leave under s. 215 and to allow a proceeding 
  to be brought against the trustee in another forum, is the effect that proceeding 
  may have on the bankruptcy process itself and the court's essential control 
  over that process. These bankruptcy considerations are critically important 
  where an interim receiver could be declared a successor employer of the debtor 
  if it carries on the debtor's business in order to sell it as a going concern. 
  Whether to carry on the business is one of the most significant decisions that 
  the receiver must make. That decision affects the entire direction of the bankruptcy 
  and its outcome and, importantly, the ability of the receiver to maximize the 
  value of the bankrupt's estate for the benefit of the affected stakeholders.</p>
<p>
  [54] In cases to date dealing with leave under s. 215 of the BIA, such as Mancini, 
  where the issue has been trustee wrongdoing, factors relating to the bankruptcy 
  court's control over the process have not arisen. In such cases, if leave is 
  granted, the trustee will hire a lawyer to defend it in court, and the trustee 
  will proceed to carry out its duties conducting the receivership or bankruptcy. 
  However, where leave is sought to proceed before the OLRB to determine if the 
  receiver is a successor employer, the outcome of the decision whether to grant 
  leave may well affect the receiver's entire course of conduct and its decision 
  whether to operate the business to sell it as a going concern, or to wind it 
  up and sell off the assets. As I stated, that decision is central to the bankruptcy 
  or receivership and critical for all stakeholders, including the employees. 
  The role of the bankruptcy court is to balance all of the affected interests 
  when making fundamental decisions concerning the bankruptcy or receivership. 
  That is not the role or function of the OLRB, whose mandate is only the interests 
  of employees and employers. The balancing of all interests must therefore be 
  carried out by the bankruptcy court at the stage when leave is sought.</p>
<p>
  [55] Counsel for the receiver has argued that if receivers and trustees are 
  going to be subject to a hearing before the OLRB in virtually every case where 
  they operate the debtor's business on an interim basis, then no receiver or 
  trustee will be prepared to do anything but wind up the business and liquidate 
  the assets, even if that would not result in the best outcome for the stakeholders. 
  Counsel says that receivers and trustees will not want the uncertainty or the 
  potential of costly personal liability for all the obligations under a collective 
  agreement including pension obligations, vacation pay, severance, grievance 
  procedures, etc.</p>
<p>
  [56] I do not know what receivers will do in the future. However, the uncertainty 
  and potential for increased costs are clear and will necessarily affect the 
  practice of appointing receivers and the decisions of creditors as to how they 
  will proceed, and could affect the willingness of a receiver or trustee to act. 
  Where a creditor is funding the receivership, any personal liability imposed 
  on the receiver for complying with a collective agreement will be factored in 
  as an additional cost of the receivership; where there is a trustee in bankruptcy 
  with no one to fund it but the estate, different considerations will certainly 
  apply and will affect the trustee's decision as to what risks of liability the 
  estate can afford to take.</p>
<p>
  [57] In my view, therefore, a leave application under s. 215 of the BIA to permit 
  successor employer proceedings before the OLRB requires the bankruptcy court 
  to go beyond the Mancini test. Certainly, these overriding bankruptcy considerations 
  may also be applied in any type of leave decision under s. 215 of the BIA where 
  they arise. However, there has been no occasion to develop or apply them to 
  date.</p>
<p>
  [58] The factors that the bankruptcy court applies on a s. 215 application will 
  relate to both procedural and substantive aspects of the process. Some important 
  factors will include: the timing of the application, the complexity of the receivership 
  and the demands on the receiver as it carries out its obligations, the potential 
  duration of the period that the receiver intends to operate the business before 
  it can be sold (normally as brief as possible), the availability of potential 
  purchasers and their financial strength, and the likelihood that a purchaser 
  will be declared a successor employer and assume all of the obligations under 
  the collective agreement. This latter factor may be particularly important because 
  it will give practical assurance to the union that all of the terms of the collective 
  agreement will be honoured and the employees protected. Another key factor is 
  the practicality of proceeding before the OLRB and the timeliness of a hearing 
  before that tribunal in the context of the proposed temporary operation of the 
  business and its sale. </p>
<p>
  [59] Finally, the court may consider the issue of immediate fairness to employees, 
  including any arrangements that the receiver has made with the union to attempt 
  to accommodate its requirements during the period before the business is sold. 
  In Royal Crest at paras. 31-32, Farley J. stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> The trustee will also have to appreciate that if it does not 
  accede to the union demands for union dues, pension contributions and grievance-type 
  procedures, then conceivably after a period of time (which may vary in length) 
  the personnel which it has employed may become disenchanted with continuing 
  at the various locations and value may evaporate or start to do so unless "corrective" 
  or "ameliorating" measures are not [sic] taken.</p>
<p class="indent">Further, it seems that any purchaser from a trustee would have 
  to take into account in determining how much to bid and/or agree to pay the 
  liabilities that the purchaser as new employer will or may "inherit." </p>
<p>Obviously, every situation will be different and will require varying accommodation 
  measures. For example, if the business is to be sold quickly, the union may 
  be less concerned with the receiver's adherence to all or part of the collective 
  agreement than if the receiver is to operate the business for an extended period.</p>
<p>
  [60] In my view, it is both necessary and appropriate that the bankruptcy court 
  use its power under s. 215 to grant or deny leave to bring a receiver or trustee 
  before the OLRB, to assist the receiver in achieving the best financial result 
  for creditors and employees of the debtor, in most cases, by operating the business 
  in order to sell it as a going concern. </p>
<p>
  [61] If the receiver can show that by operating the business for a short time 
  it can maximize the value of the business for the benefit of creditors and, 
  at the same time, thereby save as many jobs as possible, it will make sense 
  for the court to deny leave, particularly where the OLRB will, if appropriate, 
  determine that the purchaser is a successor employer, obliged to carry out the 
  collective agreement. In that way, the union and employees are protected and 
  the receiver can make its decision whether to operate the business knowing the 
  extent of its obligations.</p>
<p>
  [62] As pointed out in such cases as Big Sky and Royal Crest, and by the bankruptcy 
  judge in this case, the practice of receivers attending on the bankruptcy judge 
  ex parte, with a draft order that gives the receiver extensive powers, while 
  at the same time cloaking it with immunity from responsibilities to parties 
  who are not before the court, can no longer be sanctioned. Where unions are 
  involved, the receiver will want to meet with them in order to try to negotiate 
  an accommodation as the basis on which the receiver can proceed to operate the 
  business on an interim basis. There will be leverage, of course, on both sides, 
  as it will normally be in everyone's interest that the business ultimately continue. 
  If the parties can reach an accommodation, then the order can reflect that accommodation, 
  together with a come-back clause to deal with changes in circumstances. If they 
  cannot achieve a consensual accommodation, the bankruptcy judge will be positioned 
  to assist.</p>
<p>
  [63] Without the ability in the bankruptcy court to use section 215 to deny 
  leave, any accommodation that the receiver and the unions may reach cannot be 
  enforced. That was the unfortunate result in St. Marys Paper, supra. In that 
  case, as the bankruptcy terminated the employment of all employees, the trustee 
  negotiated with both unionized and non-unionized employees as to the terms of 
  their engagement to continue to operate the paper mill pending sale. One of 
  the terms was that the trustee would fund certain costs of the employees' pension 
  plans but would not be responsible for unfunded liabilities under the plans. 
  Despite the agreement, once an administrator for the pension plans was engaged, 
  the administrator took the position that by its actions in retaining the employees, 
  the trustee had become an employer under pension legislation and was obliged 
  to fund the unfunded liabilities under the plans. The majority of this court 
  agreed. </p>
<p>
  [64] Similarly, any agreement with a trustee must be enforceable by the bankruptcy 
  court in order to ensure that both sides in any negotiation view the negotiation 
  as meaningful.</p>
<p>
  [65] I conclude therefore, that s. 215 is part of the scheme of the BIA that 
  gives the bankruptcy court control over the entire bankruptcy and receivership 
  process. In that important context, s. 215 can be used by the court, in proper 
  cases, to deny leave to bring an application before the OLRB to have a trustee 
  or receiver declared a successor employer.</p>
<p>
  G. Section 72(1) of the BIA</p>
<p>
  [66] The parties took the position throughout that no constitutional question 
  was raised on this appeal because no party was seeking to strike down any legislation.</p>
<p>
  [67] Section 72(1) of the BIA specifically provides for the interrelationship 
  between provincial laws and the BIA by stating that provincial laws are not 
  superceded by the BIA unless they are in conflict with it.</p>
<p>
  [68] In the constitutional context, the proper approach when federal and provincial 
  legislation are potentially in conflict was set out by Gonthier J. in Husky 
  Oil Operations Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 
  453 at para. 87: </p>
<p class="indent">
  One must first determine whether the laws are respectively valid federal or 
  provincial legislation. If so, the actual operation of the laws must be examined 
  to determine whether they are in operational conflict, that is, inconsistent 
  or incapable of being fully complied with in a given situation. If they are 
  in operational conflict, the federal legislation prevails and the provincial 
  legislation is without effect to the extent of this conflict.</p>
<p>
  [69] Because the denial of leave under s. 215 of the BIA can be used by the 
  bankruptcy court in appropriate circumstances to preclude the OLRB from exercising 
  its exclusive jurisdiction to declare a person a successor employer, it is in 
  operational conflict with s. 69 of LRA when such leave is denied. When that 
  occurs, s. 72(1) of the BIA is engaged, with the result that s. 69(12) of the 
  LRA is superceded by s. 215 of the BIA.</p>

  <li>The bankruptcy court, in the exercise of its supervisory control and based 
    on factors that are relevant to the bankruptcy and in the best interests of 
    all the stakeholders, can use s. 215 of the BIA, in a proper case, to deny 
    leave to bring a successor employer proceeding against a trustee or receiver 
    before the OLRB;</li>
  <li>If the bankruptcy court denies leave under s. 215 of the BIA to proceed 
    against the trustee or receiver before the OLRB, an operational conflict arises 
    with s. 69(12) of the LRA. In that case, under s. 72(1), the BIA prevails.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Issue 2: Did the Bankruptcy judge err in the exercise of his jurisdiction not 
  to grant leave?</p>
<p>
  [71] In this case, the bankruptcy judge denied the Union's application for leave 
  under s. 215 of the BIA based on his assessment of the underlying facts that 
  could form the basis for a claim of successor employer status. He also looked 
  at the circumstances of the receivership.</p>
<p>
  [72] On the first issue, the bankruptcy judge applied a test that has been developed 
  in recent caselaw, which required him to assess whether the receiver in this 
  case was acting as a "realizer" or as an "employer" when 
  it operated the business prior to the sale to Spectrum. He concluded that because 
  KPMG had only acted "qua realizer" and not "qua employer", 
  the case had not been made out for the successor employer claim to proceed.</p>
<p>
  [73] As I stated earlier, there is nothing in the BIA that gives the bankruptcy 
  court the authority to determine the successor employer issue. During oral argument 
  before this court, counsel for the trustee was asked whether a trustee ever 
  acts other than as a realizer. I think it is fair to say that counsel agreed 
  that the role of a trustee and receiver is always to act as a realizer and not 
  in any other capacity, even if the receivership goes on for an extended time. 
  I agree. In that sense, a trustee or receiver always acts "qua realizer".</p>
<p>
  [74] In my view, the bankruptcy judge erred by applying the "realizer versus 
  employer" test to effectively determine whether the receiver was a successor 
  employer. The bankruptcy court has no jurisdiction to make that determination. 
  What the bankruptcy court can do, as part of its analysis under s. 215, is to 
  answer whether a prima facie case for successor employer status has been made 
  out. For that limited purpose, the court should apply the factors applied by 
  the OLRB and those set out by MacLachlin J. in W.W. Lester (1978), supra, at 
  para. 70, including the nature of the business before and after the alleged 
  "sale", the nature of the work covered by the collective agreement, 
  what employees were transferred, what other assets were transferred, and continuity 
  of location, of management and of work performed.</p>
<p>
  [75] Although the bankruptcy judge erred by determining the successor employer 
  issue as part of the basis for denying leave under s. 215, he also considered 
  some of the appropriate bankruptcy factors that I have referred to. The decision 
  whether to grant or deny leave under s. 215 is an exercise of discretion. Nevertheless, 
  and despite considering some bankruptcy factors, because the bankruptcy judge 
  erred by applying an incorrect threshold test as a basis for denying leave, 
  his decision must be set aside.</p>
<p>
  [76] The decision whether to grant or deny leave under s. 215 is to be made 
  by the bankruptcy court using its expertise. Consequently, I would remit the 
  matter back to the bankruptcy judge to determine whether to grant leave, based 
  on the test I have outlined, including a full assessment of all the relevant 
  bankruptcy factors that the bankruptcy court may now consider applicable in 
  this case.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [77] I would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of the bankruptcy judge 
  and remit the matter back to the bankruptcy court. Costs of the appeal and of 
  the leave motion to the appellant on the partial indemnity scale fixed in the 
  total amount of $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>

<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [78] I have had the advantage of reading the draft reasons prepared by my colleague, 
  Feldman J.A. I agree with her summary of the facts and with some of her analysis 
  and conclusions. However, I disagree with other portions of her analysis and 
  with her proposed disposition of the appeal. I would allow the union's appeal 
  and declare that the bankruptcy judge erred by not granting the union leave, 
  pursuant to s. 215 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c B-3 
  ("BIA"), to make an application to the Ontario Labour Relations Board 
  ("OLRB") for a declaration that the interim receiver was a successor 
  employer within the meaning of s. 69(2) of the Labour Relations Act, S.O. 1995, 
  c. 1, Sch. A. ("LRA").</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  [79] I agree with Feldman J.A.'s careful and comprehensive summary of the facts. 
  I would add the following observations to place the facts in context.</p>
<p> [80] Bankruptcy proceedings in a corporate context typically involve three 
  entities - a struggling debtor company, a worried creditor or creditors, and 
  a professional manager (a receiver or trustee<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a>) 
  brought in to take control of the debtor company.</p>
<p>
  [81] The receiver is put in place for a single clear and blunt purpose - to 
  realize on the assets of the debtor company and distribute the proceeds to the 
  creditors. In pursuit of this purpose, a receiver will usually adopt one of 
  two strategies: (1) terminate the company's operations, sell off its assets, 
  and distribute the proceeds to the creditors; or (2) continue the operations 
  of the company as a 'going concern' with a view to selling it, and then distribute 
  the funds obtained through the sale to the creditors.</p>
<p>
  [82] If the receiver adopts the second strategy, it will need people to operate 
  the company. An obvious potential source is the employees of the company. Those 
  employees had employment contracts with the debtor company. Many may also be 
  covered by collective agreements negotiated by their union and the company.</p>
<p>
  [83] In the present case, T.C.T. Logistics Inc. ("TCT") was in financial 
  difficulty. GMAC Commercial Finance Corporation - Canada ("GMAC") 
  was TCT's largest secured creditor. It moved under the BIA for an order appointing 
  KPMG Inc. ("KPMG") as interim receiver over the assets of TCT. The 
  bankruptcy judge, Ground J., granted the order on January 24, 2002.</p>
<p>
  [84] Neither the employees of TCT nor their union received notice of GMAC's 
  motion, in spite of the fact that KPMG's plan was to continue to operate the 
  warehouse as a going concern with a view to a sale.</p>
<p>
  [85] The initial order appointing KPMG as interim receiver had many provisions 
  that directly and negatively affected the employees. The most important provision, 
  from the employees' perspective, was probably paragraph 15: </p>
<p class="indent">
  15. THIS COURT ORDERS that the employment of employees of the Debtors, including 
  employees on maternity leave, disability leave and all other forms of approved 
  absence is hereby terminated effective immediately prior to the appointment 
  of the Receiver. Notwithstanding the appointment of the Receiver or the exercise 
  of any of its powers or the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or the 
  use or employment by the Receiver of any person in connection with its appointment 
  and the performance of its powers and duties thereunder, the Receiver is not 
  and shall not be deemed or considered to be a successor employer, related employer, 
  sponsor or payer with respect to any of the employees of any of the Debtors 
  or any former employees within the meaning of the Labour Relations Act (Ontario), 
  the Employment Standards Act (Ontario), the Pension Benefits Act (Ontario), 
  Canada Labour Code, Pension Benefits Act (Canada) or any other statute, regulation 
  or rule of law or equity for any purpose, whatsoever, or any collective agreement 
  or other contract between any of the Debtors and any of their present or former 
  employees, or otherwise. In particular, the Receiver shall not be liable to 
  any of the employees of any of the Debtors for any wages (as "wages" 
  are defined in Employment Standards Act (Ontario)), including severance pay, 
  termination pay and vacation pay, except for such wages as the Receiver may 
  specifically agree to pay. The Receiver shall not be liable for an [sic] contribution 
  or other payment to any pension or benefit.</p>
<p>
  [86] On the same day the court made its order, KPMG notified TCT's employees 
  that it had been appointed as interim receiver of TCT. KPMG advised the employees 
  that its intention was "to continue operations in order to evaluate the 
  potential sales of various lines of business". The memo said that wages 
  would be paid, but did not point out any of the features of paragraph 15 of 
  the court order, including that the employees' employment "is hereby terminated 
  effective immediately".</p>
<p>
  [87] Between the initial order on January 24, 2002 and May 9, 2002, the employees 
  continued to work at the TCT warehouse in Toronto. KPMG paid their wages but 
  did not contribute to their pension plans or fund arrears of vacation pay.</p>
<p>
  [88] KPMG sold the assets of TCT to Spectrum Supply Chain Solutions Inc. ("Spectrum") 
  in April 2002. One of the terms of the sale, accepted and acted on by KPMG, 
  was that KPMG would terminate all employees prior to the closing of the sale. 
  KPMG did not tell the employees about this consequence until May 9, 2002 - the 
  very day it fired them, effective May 16.</p>
<p>
  [89] As my colleague points out, the president of Spectrum is a former vice-president 
  of TCT. Spectrum is operating out of new premises in Mississauga but is servicing 
  mostly the former TCT customer base. Spectrum hired several of TCT's warehouse 
  managers to perform similar duties for Spectrum. Spectrum also hired several 
  of TCT's unionized employees, but without regard to the seniority list.</p>
<p>
  [90] KPMG knew, and was an active party in achieving, all of this in the January-May 
  2002 period.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [91] I would frame the issues somewhat differently than my colleague: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Does s. 47(2) of the BIA provide a bankruptcy judge with 
  authority to declare that a receiver is not a successor employer under the LRA?</p>
<p class="indent">(2) If the answer to (1) is 'No', then did the bankruptcy judge 
  err by refusing to grant leave to the union, pursuant to s. 215 of the BIA, 
  to commence proceedings against the receiver before the OLRB?</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) The bankruptcy court and the question of successor employer</p>
<p>
  [92] In Ontario, the subject matter of successor employer is dealt with in s. 
  69(2) of the LRA: </p>
<p class="indent">
  69(2) Where an employer who is bound by or is a party to a collective agreement 
  with a trade union or council of trade unions sells his, his or its business, 
  the person to whom the business has been sold is, until the Board otherwise 
  declares, bound by the collective agreement as if the person had been a party 
  thereto and, where an employer sells his, her or its business while an application 
  for certification or termination of bargaining rights to which the employer 
  is a party is before the Board, the person to whom the business has been sold 
  is, until the Board otherwise declares, the employer for the purposes of the 
  application as if the person were named as the employer in the application.	
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [93] This court considered the successor employer provisions of the LRA in Ajax 
  (Town) v. National, Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers 
  Union of Canada (CAW - Canada), Local 222 (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 426. Goudge J.A. 
  described their purpose and implications at p. 432: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The statutory definition is inclusive: "'sells' includes leases, transfers 
  and any other manner of disposition". Because of the remedial purpose of 
  s. 64 [now s. 69], namely the preservation of bargaining rights, this definition 
  is to be given a broad and liberal interpretation. Moreover, it is not required 
  that the transfer take any particular legal form nor take place by way of a 
  legal transaction. In W.W. Lester, supra, at pp. 674-75, McLachlin J. put it 
  this way: </p>
<p class="indent10"> Ten of the labour acts have provisions similarly worded to 
  s. 89 of the Newfoundland Act, referring to transactions such as sale, lease, 
  transfer or disposition. (The Quebec Act also contains a successorship provision 
  but the section uses the phrase "alienation or operation".) Although the terms 
  "sale" and "lease" may have restricted meanings, the words "transfer" and "other 
  disposition" have been broadly interpreted to include several types of transactions, 
  including exchange, gift, trust, take overs, mergers, and amalgamation.</p>
<p class="indent10">In keeping with the purpose of successorship provisions - 
  labour boards have interpreted "disposition" broadly to include almost any mode 
  of transfer and have not relied on technical legal forms of business transactions. 
  As explained by the Ontario Board in United Steelworkers of America v. Thorco 
  Manufacturing Ltd. (1965), 65 C.L.L.C. &sect; 16,502, an expansive definition 
  accords with the purpose of the section - to preserve bargaining rights regardless 
  of the legal form of the transaction which puts bargaining rights in jeopardy.</p>
<p>
  [94] The question of whether a business has been sold comes within the exclusive 
  jurisdiction of the OLRB: see ss. 69(12) and 114 (1) of the LRA. In Ajax, Goudge 
  J.A. observed, at p. 429, that in making this determination the OLRB "is 
  engaged in one of those tasks that most obviously engages its specialized expertise, 
  namely the determination of whether the labour relations obligations of one 
  employer pass to another employer."</p>
<p>
  [95] Acting pursuant to s. 69 of the LRA, the OLRB has found both a court appointed 
  receiver and a receiver appointed by private instrument to be successor employers: 
  see Deloitte &amp; Touche, [1993] O.L.R.D. No. 458 and H &amp; S Reliance Ltd., 
  [1998] O.L.R.D. No. 4087.</p>
<p>
  [96] KPMG and GMAC do not quarrel with the general jurisdiction of the OLRB 
  in the successor employer domain. However, they contend that in a bankruptcy 
  context, the bankruptcy court has a parallel jurisdiction to deal with the same 
  question by virtue of s. 47(2) of the BIA: </p>
<p class="indent">
  47(2) The court may direct an interim receiver appointed under subsection (1) 
  to do any or all of the following: </p>
<p class="indent"> (a) take possession of all or part of the debtor's property 
  mentioned in the appointment;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) exercise such control over that property, and over the debtor's 
  business, as the court considers advisable; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) take such other action as the court considers advisable.</p>
<p>
  KPMG and GMAC rely, in particular, on s. 47(2)(b). They submit that a decision 
  by a bankruptcy judge to immunize a receiver from successor employer status 
  is a permissible element of the court's exercise of control over the debtor's 
  business.</p>
<p>
  [97] For several reasons, I disagree with KPMG's and GMAC's submissions on this 
  point.</p>
<p>
  [98] First, the parties explicitly disclaim any constitutional challenge to 
  either s. 69(2) of the LRA or s. 47(2) of the BIA. They assert that these provisions 
  can and should be read together. I agree.</p>
<p>
  [99] Second, the starting point for reading the provisions together is s. 72(1) 
  of the BIA: </p>
<p class="indent">
  72(1) The provisions of this Act shall not be deemed to abrogate or supercede 
  the substantive provisions of any other law or statute relating to property 
  and civil rights that are not in conflict with this Act. . . .</p>
<p>
  Since the LRA is a law relating to civil rights (labour law has long been held 
  to come within provincial jurisdiction under s. 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 
  1867: see Toronto Electric Commissioners v. Snider, [1925] A.C. 396), and since 
  there is no issue of conflict, it follows that s. 47(2) of the BIA should not 
  be interpreted to abrogate or supercede s. 69(2) of the LRA.</p>
<p>
  [100] Third, the Supreme Court of Canada made precisely the same point in a 
  very recent decision, Crystalline Investment Ltd. v. Domgroup Ltd., [2004] S.C.J. 
  No. 3. In that case, the court considered the impact of the BIA on provincially 
  regulated property and civil rights. Major J. stated at para. 43: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [E]xplicit statutory language is required to divest persons of rights they otherwise 
  enjoy at law&#133; [S]o long as the doctrine of paramountcy is not triggered, 
  federally regulated bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings cannot be used to 
  subvert provincially regulated property and civil rights.</p>
<p> [101] Fourth, I agree with Feldman J.A. that a collective agreement does not 
  terminate on bankruptcy and can bind a successor employer who takes over the 
  business of the debtor: see Saan Stores Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Labour Relations 
  Board) (1999), 172 D.L.R. (4th) 134 (N.S.C.A.), and Syndicat national de l'amiante 
  d'Abestos inc v. Jeffrey Mines Inc., [2003] Q.J. No. 264 (C.A.). As expressed 
  by Dalphond J.A. in Jeffrey Mines<a href="#a">[4]</a><a name="4"></a> at para. 
  60: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The collective agreements continue to apply like any contract of successive 
  performance not modified by mutual agreement after the initial order or not 
  disclaimed (assuming that to be possible in the case of collective agreements). 
  Neither the monitor nor the court can amend them unilaterally.</p>
<p>
  [102] In my view, these four points strongly suggest that the general wording 
  of s. 47(2) of the BIA should not be interpreted to carve out an exception to 
  the clear import of s. 69(2) of the LRA and the relevant case law - the issue 
  of successor employer is one within the exclusive jurisdiction of the OLRB. 
  In short, exclusive means exclusive.</p>
<p> [103] My colleague, Feldman J.A., summaries some of her conclusions in this 
  fashion: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Section 47(2) of the BIA does not give the bankruptcy court the authority 
    to determine whether a receiver or trustee that carries on the business of 
    a debtor is a successor employer;</li>
  <li>A collective agreement does not terminate on bankruptcy and can bind a successor 
    employer who takes over the business of the debtor, if the labour board so 
    declares;</li>
  <li>The OLRB has exclusive jurisdiction to declare a person who carries on a 
    business formerly conducted by another person to be a successor employer; 
    ....</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I agree with these conclusions.</p>
<p>
  (2) Section 215 of the BIA and the question of leave</p>
<p>
  [104] Although the LRA gives the OLRB exclusive jurisdiction to determine successor 
  employer applications, in bankruptcy proceedings a party seeking to challenge 
  a decision by a trustee must seek leave from a judge pursuant to s. 215 of the 
  BIA: </p>
<p class="indent">
  215. Except by leave of the court, no action lies against &#133; a trustee with 
  respect to any report made under, or any action taken pursuant to, this Act.</p>
<p>
  [105] The bankruptcy judge refused to grant leave on the basis that as long 
  as KPMG acted in its role as realizer of assets, it was not really acting as 
  an employer. Accordingly, he concluded that KPMG "did not continue TCT's 
  business in the sense contemplated by the OLRB."</p>
<p>
  [106] I have two difficulties with this analysis and conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [107] First, the conclusion in the quoted passage is a determination of the 
  successor employer issue with respect to KPMG. This is precisely the question 
  that the bankruptcy judge cannot decide because it comes within the exclusive 
  jurisdiction of the OLRB under s. 69(2) of the LRA.</p>
<p>
  [108] Second, the purported distinction between the receiver acting qua realizer 
  of assets and the receiver acting qua employer is, with respect, illusory. The 
  receiver is always acting with a single focus - to realize on assets for the 
  benefit of the creditors. Any decision the receiver makes concerning the employees 
  of the debtor company is grounded in that singular role.</p>
<p>
  [109] In spite of these difficulties, the key question remains: should the bankruptcy 
  judge have granted the union's application for leave to commence proceedings 
  before the OLRB with respect to KPMG's potential status as a successor employer? 
  On that question, the threshold that the union must cross is a low one: see 
  Mancini (Bankrupt) et al. v. Falconi et al. (1993), 61 O.A.C. 332; Society of 
  Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada v. Armitage (2000), 50 O.R. 
  (3d) 688 (C.A.) ("SOCAN"); Vanderwoude et al. v. Scott and Pichelli 
  et al. (2001), 143 O.A.C. 195; and Re Royal Crest Lifecare Group Inc., [2004] 
  O.J. No. 174 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [110] The test for granting leave under s. 215 of the BIA was stated by Osborne 
  J.A. in Mancini at p. 334: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The following principles can be taken from the decided cases: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. Leave to sue a trustee should not be granted if the action 
  is frivolous or vexatious. Manifestly unmeritorious claims should not be permitted 
  to proceed.</p>
<p class="indent">2. An action should not be allowed to proceed if the evidence 
  filed in support of the motion, including the intended action as pleaded in 
  draft form, does not disclose a cause of action against the trustee. The evidence 
  typically will be presented by way of affidavit and must supply facts to support 
  the claim sought to be asserted: see Peat Marwick Ltd. v. Thorne Riddell, supra.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The court is not required to make final assessment of the 
  merits of the claim before granting leave: see Re Lufro Lt&eacute;e; Leblond 
  v. Tremblay (1985), 54 C.B.R. (N.S.) 199 (Que. C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [111] My colleague, Feldman J.A., does not accept and apply the Mancini test 
  in the context of a s. 215 leave application in the successor employer domain. 
  She posits a test that is, in my view, both more vague and more elaborate than 
  the Mancini test. Importantly, it also erects a much higher hurdle for employees 
  and unions seeking leave than for all other applicants. My colleague frames 
  her test in this fashion: </p>
<p class="indent"> The factors that the bankruptcy court applies on a s. 215 application 
  will relate to both procedural and substantive aspects of the process. Some 
  important factors will include: the timing of the application, the complexity 
  of the receivership and the demands on the receiver as it carries out its obligations, 
  the potential duration of the period that the receiver intends to operate the 
  business before it can be sold (normally as brief as possible), the availability 
  of potential purchasers and their financial strength, and the likelihood that 
  a purchaser will be declared a successor employer and assume all of the obligations 
  under the collective agreement. This latter factor may be particularly important 
  because it will give practical assurance to the union that all of the terms 
  of the collective agreement will be honoured and the employees protected. Another 
  key factor is the practicality of proceeding before the OLRB and the timeliness 
  of a hearing before that tribunal in the context of the proposed temporary operation 
  of the business and its sale.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the court may consider the issue of immediate fairness 
  to employees, including any arrangements that the receiver has made with the 
  union to attempt to accommodate its requirements during the period before the 
  business is sold.</p>
<p>
  [112] With respect, I do not think that this is an appropriate test, as a matter 
  of legal principle or bankruptcy and labour relations practice. I say this for 
  several reasons.</p>
<p>
  [113] First, the Mancini test is a longstanding and regularly cited and applied 
  test in the context of BIA s. 215 applications for leave: see, for example, 
  SOCAN and Vanderwoude.</p>
<p>
  [114] Second, and importantly, this court unanimously applied the Mancini test 
  two months ago in Royal Crest, a case involving a union's application to commence 
  a successor employer application in relation to a receiver before the OLRB. 
  In Royal Crest, the court divided on the question of whether the bankruptcy 
  judge properly exercised his discretion in refusing to grant leave. However, 
  there was no disagreement about the test for granting leave. The majority said, 
  at para. 25, that the "case law establishes that the threshold for granting 
  leave under s. 215 of the BIA is a low one" and cited Mancini in support 
  of this proposition. Borins J.A., in dissent, grounded his comprehensive reasons 
  in an application of the Mancini test. In light of Royal Crest, I do not think 
  it is appropriate or desirable to carve out a single subject matter (successor 
  employer applications brought by employees and unions) and apply a different 
  and much stricter test to this subject matter and these applicants.</p>
<p>
  [115] Third, my colleague concludes that s. 47(2) of the BIA does not give the 
  bankruptcy judge the authority to determine whether a receiver that carries 
  on the business of the debtor company is a successor employer. I agree. The 
  wording in s. 47(2) that the receiver relies on in support of its position authorizes 
  the court to direct the receiver to "exercise such control &#133; over 
  the debtor's business, as the court considers advisable". The test proposed 
  by my colleague to give the court jurisdiction to immunize a receiver from a 
  successor employer proceeding (and thus effectively declare the receiver not 
  to be a successor employer) strikes me as merely an elaborate formulation of 
  s. 47(2). In short, and with respect, my colleague introduces through the side 
  door of s. 215 (a leave provision, not a provision conferring authority on the 
  receiver) precisely what she correctly does not permit the receiver to do through 
  the front door of s. 47(2).</p>
<p>
  [116] Fourth, I do not see any principled legal basis for treating successor 
  employer applications brought by employees and unions differently than any other 
  applications. If leave applications by creditors to commence actions against 
  the receiver (SOCAN and Vanderwoude) are determined by the bankruptcy judge 
  under the low threshold test of whether the proposed action is frivolous or 
  vexatious, I fail to see why leave applications by employees or unions relating 
  to successor employer or unfair practice issues should be subject to a more 
  stringent test. On the contrary, it seems to me that the receiver's conduct 
  in the administration of the debtor company should be treated on the same plane 
  in relation to all stakeholders. Creditors do not deserve greater protection 
  from the bankruptcy court than do employees and unions.</p>
<p>
  [117] I turn, therefore, to a consideration of the Mancini test.</p>
<p>
  [118] In my view, there is nothing frivolous or vexatious about the union's 
  application to the OLRB concerning KPMG's potential status as a successor employer.</p>
<p>
  [119] On January 24, 2002, a considerable number of employees worked at TCT's 
  Toronto warehouse. They were protected by a collective agreement. On that date, 
  a court order with an immediate and blunt impact on these employees was made: </p>
<p class="indent">
  15. THIS COURT ORDERS that the employment of employees of the Debtors, including 
  employees on maternity leave, disability leave and all other forms of approved 
  absence is hereby terminated effective immediately prior to the appointment 
  of the Receiver. </p>
<p>
  Neither the employees nor their union received notice of the court hearing at 
  which this order was made.</p>
<p>
  [120] On the same day, KPMG notified the employees that it had been appointed 
  interim receiver. KPMG did not inform the employees that their employment had 
  been terminated by court order; on the contrary, it indicated that it intended 
  to continue operations with a view to a sale and that it would pay wages to 
  the employees.</p>
<p>
  [121] During the next three months, KPMG respected some provisions of the collective 
  agreement (for example, wages) and did not comply with other provisions (for 
  example, pension contributions and vacation pay).</p>
<p>
  [122] On April 18, 2002, the court approved the sale of TCT to Spectrum. On 
  May 9, KPMG gave the employees notice of termination effective May 16.</p>
<p>
  [123] I do not recite this chronology to indicate that in my view KPMG was a 
  successor employer during the period of its receivership. Nor do I suggest that 
  KPMG engaged in any unfair labour practices with respect to TCT's employees. 
  Rather, I recite these events to indicate that there is a live issue concerning 
  KPMG's potential status as a successor employer during the period of its receivership. 
  This issue deserves to be considered by the OLRB, which has exclusive jurisdiction 
  in this domain.</p>
<p>
  [124] I conclude with a general observation. Although bankruptcy proceedings 
  are stressful for a debtor company, its creditors, the receiver and the bankruptcy 
  judge, the position of the employees of the debtor company cannot be ignored, 
  especially if they are protected by collective agreements.</p>
<p>
  [125] In Reference Re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.), [1987] 
  1 S.C.R. 313 at 368, Dickson C.J.C. observed: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Work is one of the most fundamental aspects in a person's life, providing the 
  individual with a means of financial support and, as importantly, a contributory 
  role in society. A person's employment is an essential component of his or her 
  sense of identity, self-worth and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>
  [126] In Jeffrey Mines, supra, at paras. 44-46, Dalphond J.A. stated: </p>
<p class="indent"> There is nothing in the orders rendered about the abolishment 
  or modification of the certifications. Thus, the appellant's certifications 
  are still valid and in effect. Furthermore, it is doubtful that the Superior 
  Court would have jurisdiction to rule on such matters, as determined by the 
  majority in conjunction with winding-up of the Coop&eacute;rants (Syndicat des 
  employ&eacute;s de cooperatives d'assurance-vie v. Raymond, Chabot, Fafard, 
  Gagnon inc., [1997] R.J.Q. 886 (C.A.)), unless that were allowed under a constitutionally 
  valid provision in the CCAA. It follows that the appellants' exclusive representation 
  continues, which, incidentally, is recognized in paragraph 6 of the initial 
  order, where it is stated that a notice to their union constitutes a notice 
  to their employees.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the certifications are still valid, their effects must 
  be recognized, described as follows in N&ouml;el v. Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'&eacute;nergie 
  de la Baie-James, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 207, at paras. 41 and 42: </p>
<p class="indent10"> &#133; Once certification is granted, it imposes significant 
  obligations on the employer, imposing on it a duty to recognize the certified 
  union and bargain with it in good faith with the aim of concluding a collective 
  agreement &#133; Once the collective agreement is concluded, it is binding on 
  both the employees and the employer&#133;</p>
<p class="indent10">&#133; Certification, followed by the collective agreement, 
  takes away the employer's right to negotiate directly with its employees. Because 
  of its exclusive representation function, the presence of the union erects a 
  screen between the employer and the employees. The employer loses the option 
  of negotiating different conditions of employment with individual employees.</p>
<p class="indent10">. . .</p>
<p class="indent">Consequently, the monitor cannot disregard the appellants' 
  exclusive representation with regard to the positions covered by certification 
  units. Signing an individual contract with a person occupying any certified 
  position violates the appellants' exclusive representation and is therefore 
  illegal.</p>
<p>
  [127] The implications from these passages are clear. In a bankruptcy context, 
  as in any other employment context, the position and rights of employees must 
  be considered and respected, including by the receiver and the bankruptcy judge. 
  Moreover, if a collective agreement is in place, the receiver and the bankruptcy 
  judge cannot ignore it. Specifically, the receiver cannot 'cherry pick' the 
  terms of the collective agreement, and seek court approval for such a decision. 
  If the receiver seeks to operate the debtor company as a going concern with 
  a view to a future sale, it will need to involve the employees and their union 
  in an open, honest and comprehensive discussion about the basis on which the 
  employees will continue their employment during the receivership. If the receiver 
  proposes to change any of the terms of employment or provisions in the collective 
  agreement during the receivership, it will need the consent of the employees 
  and their union.</p>
<p>
  [128] For these reasons, I conclude that the bankruptcy judge erred by refusing 
  to grant leave to the union to commence proceedings against KPMG before the 
  OLRB.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [129] I would allow the appeal, delete paragraph 15 of the Order of the bankruptcy 
  judge dated January 24, 2002 as amended by the Order dated April 29, 2003, and 
  grant leave to the appellant to continue proceedings before the OLRB respecting 
  successor employer and unfair labour practices claims in relation to the respondent 
  KPMG Inc.</p>
<p>
  [130] I would award the appellant its costs of the appeal on the partial indemnity 
  scale fixed at $15,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>

<p>
  CRONK J.A. (Concurring): </p>
<p> [131] I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of my colleagues 
  Feldman and MacPherson JJ.A. I agree with the reasons of Feldman J.A., including 
  her conclusion that it is appropriate in this case, for the reasons outlined 
  by her, to remit this matter back to the bankruptcy judge for reconsideration 
  whether leave should be granted to the Union<a href="#a">[5]</a><a name="5"></a> 
  under s. 215 of the BIA to commence successor employer proceedings against KPMG 
  before the OLRB. However, I wish to add the following comments on the role of 
  the bankruptcy court on a s. 215 leave application and the scope of the test 
  for leave under s. 215 of the BIA. </p>
<p>
  (1) Role of the Bankruptcy Court</p>
<p>[132] I agree with Feldman J.A. that, in the case of a business debtor, a bankruptcy 
  or interim receivership can be a cataclysmic event for all affected parties. 
  It signals a sea change in the operations and financial vitality of the debtor, 
  displaces the pre-bankruptcy or pre-receivership status quo, and leaves the 
  debtor on the equivalent of corporate life support. For that reason, measures 
  which could have the practical effect of preventing a trustee or receiver from 
  exploring all reasonable options for the maximization of the value of the debtor's 
  estate, or from agreeing to operate the business of the debtor as a going concern, 
  are undesirable. If the interests of all stakeholders in a bankruptcy or receivership 
  are to be respected and maximized, including those of affected employees, it 
  is essential that the role of the trustee in bankruptcy or the receiver not 
  be confined to the delivery of only palliative care for the ailing debtor.</p>
<p>
  [133] Parliament has determined that one court should enjoy sole control over 
  the assets and property of bankrupt companies and companies in liquidation: 
  see Sam L&eacute;vy &amp; Associ&eacute;s v. Azco Mining Inc., [2001] 3 S.C.R. 
  978 at paras. 26 and 27. This single control policy underlies Parliament's broader 
  statutory scheme, established by the BIA, for the regulation of bankruptcies 
  and receiverships in Canada and the administration of bankrupt estates. In that 
  context, Parliament has assigned to the bankruptcy court an important gatekeeper 
  function under s. 215 of the BIA. This section, which requires the prior approval 
  of the bankruptcy court for the commencement of proceedings against officers 
  of the court who report or take action under the BIA, is intended to facilitate 
  Parliament's enunciated policy of single control and to ensure that a receivership 
  or bankruptcy is not interrupted, delayed or diverted by litigation without 
  just cause.</p>
<p>
  [134] In order to ensure that the bankruptcy court's gatekeeper function under 
  s. 215 is meaningful, it is appropriate that in determining whether to grant 
  leave under s. 215, the bankruptcy court take into account the potential impact 
  of the proposed litigation on the administration and conduct of the bankruptcy 
  or the receivership. To do otherwise, in my view, is to render the function 
  of the bankruptcy court under s. 215 perfunctory and to undermine Parliament's 
  intention concerning the purpose of s. 215.</p>
<p>
  (2) Scope of the Test for Leave Under s. 215 of the BIA</p>
<p>
  [135] In his reasons for judgment in this case, my colleague MacPherson J.A. 
  indicates that Feldman J.A. does not accept and apply the test developed in 
  Mancini (Bankrupt) v. Falconi (1993), 61 O.A.C. 332 in the context of a s. 215 
  leave application in the successor employer domain. </p>
<p>
  [136] He also suggests that the test posited by Feldman J.A. is both more vague 
  and more elaborate than the Mancini test and that it creates a higher hurdle 
  for employees and unions seeking leave under s. 215 than for all other applicants. 
  He later returns to this theme in his reasons, when he observes that successor 
  employer applications brought by employees and unions should not be treated 
  differently than any other applications. Finally, he expresses his view that 
  the s. 215 test for leave propounded by Feldman J.A. is inappropriate and undesirable 
  having regard to the recent decision of this court in Re Royal Crest Lifecare 
  Group Inc., [2004] O.J. No. 174 (C.A.). With respect, I disagree with these 
  conclusions, for several reasons.</p>
<p>
  [137] First, the principles to be derived from the existing case law concerning 
  s. 215 leave applications require that, in deciding whether to grant leave under 
  s. 215, the bankruptcy court focus on the merits of the proposed litigation 
  and the sufficiency of the evidence filed in support of the leave application, 
  to ensure that frivolous or vexatious claims against trustees and receivers 
  do not proceed. The objective, once again, is to ensure that bankruptcies and 
  receiverships are not interrupted, delayed or diverted without just cause.</p>
<p>
  [138] The approach to s. 215 leave applications urged by Feldman J.A. does not 
  abrogate these organizing principles for the test for leave under that section. 
  They remain intact even where the leave application concerns proposed successor 
  employer proceedings. In addition, however, in such cases, the principles that 
  underlie the Mancini test are to be augmented by regard to specific bankruptcy 
  considerations.</p>
<p>
  [139] Second, as Feldman J.A. recognizes in her reasons, the factors that she 
  identifies as relevant to the bankruptcy court's determination whether to grant 
  leave under s. 215 of the BIA may apply to s. 215 leave applications not concerned 
  with proposed successor employer proceedings before the OLRB. If that proves 
  to be the case as the bankruptcy court jurisprudence develops, the augmented 
  test for leave set out in this case will not present a higher hurdle for employees 
  and unions who seek leave than for other applicants who seek leave for purposes 
  unrelated to successor employer proceedings.</p>
<p>
  [140] Third, in my view, this court's decision in Royal Crest does not impede 
  adoption of an augmented Mancini test in appropriate cases, including cases 
  where leave under s. 215 is sought to permit successor employer proceedings 
  before the OLRB. In Royal Crest, the core issue for determination by the court 
  was whether the bankruptcy judge had erred in denying leave under s. 215 of 
  the BIA having regard to the timing of the union's application to commence successor 
  employer proceedings in connection with a receiver. On a s. 215 leave application, 
  the timing of proposed litigation is an important bankruptcy consideration. 
  In addition, while the Mancini test for leave under s. 215 was recognized in 
  Royal Crest, the content of that test was not in issue in the case.</p>
<p>
  [141] Finally, at its heart, this appeal requires consideration of both the 
  expertise and jurisdiction of the OLRB in relation to successor employer determinations 
  and, as well, the expertise and jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court in relation 
  to bankruptcies and receiverships. The role and expertise of bankruptcy judges, 
  the need for the bankruptcy court to maintain control over the administration 
  and conduct of bankruptcies and receiverships, and the necessity of formal mechanisms 
  to enforce agreements entered into by receivers and unions, must inform the 
  scope of the test to be applied under s. 215 of the BIA. </p>
<p>
  [142] The test for leave developed in Mancini contemplates that leave will be 
  granted under s. 215 where the existence of a genuine cause of action is demonstrated, 
  regardless of the likelihood of ultimate success in the litigation. I do not 
  believe that this formulation of the test for leave was intended to be so strictly 
  construed as to preclude consideration of the potential impact of the proposed 
  litigation, should leave be granted, on the administration of the bankrupt's 
  estate and the receiver's or the trustee's ability to maximize the value of 
  the estate for all stakeholders.</p>
<p>
  [143] Such a narrow construction of the test for leave is inconsistent with 
  the gatekeeper function of the bankruptcy court under s. 215 and with the intention 
  of Parliament concerning the regulation of bankruptcies and the bankruptcy court's 
  control over the administration of bankrupt estates, as reflected in the BIA. 
  In contrast, the augmented test for leave outlined by Feldman J.A. in this case, 
  which requires that bankruptcy considerations be taken into account in deciding 
  whether to grant leave, is intended to conceptually guide the bankruptcy judge 
  in his or her approach on s. 215 leave applications so as to focus the bankruptcy 
  judge's analysis on issues of fairness for all parties with an interest in the 
  receivership or the bankruptcy. I conclude that this approach to leave under 
  s. 215 best supports and advances the goals sought by Parliament to be achieved 
  under the BIA.</p>
