<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Bruce C. Hawkins of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting without a jury, dated November 15, 2001, and the sentence 
  imposed by Justice Hawkins dated January 25, 2002.</p>
<p>
  WEILER J.A.: </p>
<p>
  Nature of Appeal </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant Nicos Timotheou appeals from his conviction for sexual assault 
  and, if necessary, seeks leave to appeal and appeals his sentence of three years 
  incarceration imposed on January 25, 2002. In relation to the conviction appeal, 
  the appellant alleges that the verdict is unreasonable or in the alternative 
  that the trial judge's misapprehensions of the evidence necessitate a new trial. 
  In addition, the appellant alleges that the trial judge erred in not considering 
  the defence of honest but mistaken belief raised by the appellant. For the reasons 
  that follow, I am of the opinion that the verdict is not unreasonable, but I 
  would order a new trial based on the trial judge's misapprehensions of the evidence. 
  As a result, it is unnecessary to deal with the other issues raised and I do 
  not do so.</p>
<p>
  Background</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant and the complainant had sexual intercourse in the basement 
  of a bar on the evening of June 20, 1999. After the incident, the complainant 
  left the bar and phoned her husband from a payphone outside. She then called 
  the police who began an investigation that resulted in the appellant being charged 
  with sexual assault. </p>
<p>
  [3] The main issue at trial was whether the complainant had consented to sexual 
  intercourse with the appellant. Counsel for the appellant also raised the issue 
  of honest belief in consent in his submissions. </p>
<p>
  [4] The 30 year old complainant, a law student, testified that she lived with 
  her husband and their daughter, Sylvia. After she and her daughter helped her 
  next-door-neighbour, Mike, with a yard sale, she and her daughter participated 
  in a barbecue during which she had a shot of whiskey and a beer. Mike ran out 
  of alcohol and suggested that the complainant accompany him to purchase more. 
  The liquor store was closed. They went to a bar and had a shot of whiskey. Earlier 
  in the evening, the complainant told Mike that she was looking for work and 
  would take whatever work she could get. Mike suggested that they go to a second 
  bar where he knew the owner of the bar who might be in a position to offer her 
  a job. </p>
<p>
  [5] The owner of the bar, Ms. Tekle, testified that Mike and the complainant 
  came into the bar about 11:30 and had a drink. Mike, whom she knew as a friend, 
  introduced Ms. Tekle to the complainant and the complainant told her that she 
  was looking for some work. Ms. Tekle offered her a couple of shifts and told 
  her that if she was available she could start the next day or the day after. 
  The appellant was also present and met the complainant. Mike asked the appellant 
  to show the complainant around. Ms. Tekle noticed that the complainant was flirting 
  with the appellant because of her body language and because she was smiling 
  at him. Ms. Tekle left for a few minutes to get change for the pool table and 
  asked the appellant to watch the bar while she was gone. </p>
<p>
  [6] The complainant testified that she went downstairs to use the washroom. 
  It was a small one-person bathroom with cleaning supplies and a door that did 
  not seem to close all the way. She pulled down her jeans to prepare to use the 
  toilet. The complainant testified that she "blacked out" several times 
  during the evening because of her alcohol intake. She did so in the toilet. 
  She testified that by "blacking out" she meant that she could not 
  remember certain parts of the evening. In cross-examination, she was asked the 
  following questions and gave the following answers: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. If I asked you that question, what do you mean by blacking 
  out? Your answer would be, I was aware, and then I was unaware, and you don't 
  know if you were conscious or unconscious; is that correct?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Correct. To a degree. When I became aware, I was on the floor, 
  as if I had passed out." </p>
<p class="indent">Q. Okay. So you went to the washroom?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Right.</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And you went to use the toilet?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And then what happened?</p>
<p class="indent">A. And then the very next thing I remember is that the accused 
  was right there in my face, and that I had been penetrated, and then I blacked 
  out again. </p>
<p class="indent">Q. Did you -- I know that you haven't said that you did this, 
  but did you take down his zipper on his pants?</p>
<p class="indent">A. No. </p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And if I asked you, and I am, can you tell us what transpired 
  up to the time that he got his penis into you, and your answer is that you don't 
  know?</p>
<p class="indent">A. I don't know. I blacked out.</p>
<p>
  [7] Once the complainant was conscious of what was going on, she said she "pushed 
  at the appellant" but did not want to start a fight with him out of fear. 
  She was shocked, stunned, angry and upset by what was happening. She testified 
  that she was two or three days into her period, the heavy portion, and her general 
  view on having intercourse while menstruating was that she found the idea repulsive, 
  disgusting and gross. When asked how she felt about the appellant's penis in 
  her vagina she stated, "Even if I had been in a normal healthy state it 
  wasn't something I consented to, and I didn't consent to it in a drunk state 
  either." She thought he might have ejaculated because she felt wetter than 
  just being on her period. The next thing she recalled after the intercourse 
  was running across the street and almost getting hit by a convertible. She went 
  to a pay phone and called her husband but could not make herself understood. 
  She then called the police. </p>
<p>
  [8] The police officer who met the complainant noted that she was crying and 
  hysterical. The officer testified that the complainant was still crying and 
  upset when a sexual assault kit examination was conducted a couple of hours 
  later. After they arrived at the police station the complainant indicated she 
  was going to be sick, was taken to the public washroom of the police station 
  and threw up. The police officer said that the complainant's speech was not 
  slurred and when asked questions the answers she gave were responsive. The officer 
  was of the opinion that the complainant would have been too impaired to drive 
  a car. </p>
<p>
  [9] The appellant testified that the complainant had four or five drinks while 
  she was in his company. She left two drinks on the bar. He testified that the 
  complainant wanted to go downstairs to see where the coolers were in anticipation 
  for her work, that he told her no, that after the owner of the bar left Mike 
  pointed out that the complainant had gone downstairs, that Mike was enticing 
  him to have sex with her, gave him some marijuana to give to the complainant 
  and told him that she liked it. The appellant says he took the marijuana, put 
  it in his pocket and went downstairs to bring the complainant back up. The complainant 
  was just coming out of the washroom and her zipper was undone. The appellant 
  testified that as soon as the complainant saw him she started kissing him. He 
  reciprocated. She backed up into the washroom and he followed. She undid his 
  zipper and opened his trousers. He made love to her quickly and then left immediately 
  to return upstairs as he figured he only had about 5 minutes in total before 
  his girlfriend returned. The appellant said nothing at all to the complainant 
  before or during sex. He did not ask if she wanted to have sex or if she wanted 
  him to use a condom. The appellant explained that he knew the complainant was 
  consenting because she did not object, and she gave him the "type of kiss 
  that was asking for screwing." He did not feel her push at him. </p>
<p>
  [10] The trial judge's reasons were particularly brief. After reciting what 
  he considered to be the salient points in the evidence of the complainant and 
  the appellant, the trial judge held: </p>
<p class="indent">
  As I indicated above, the complainant cannot remember if she drank much at the 
  bar. The accused said that she did. The defence of honest and mistaken belief 
  in consent does not arise here. This is not a case where there was equivocal 
  conduct. The defence would be consent, not mistaken identity. The accused's 
  evidence is that the complainant was not only willing but eager. I do not believe 
  the evidence of the accused, nor does it raise a reasonable doubt. The evidence 
  of the complainant is convincing. She would not consent to sex while menstruating, 
  nor in any case to stand up sex in the basement of a bar. I find the accused 
  guilty as charged.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  [11] The appellant alleges that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence 
  in a number of ways and that as a result the verdict was unreasonable or alternatively 
  resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>[12] In my opinion the verdict was not unreasonable. The evidence capable of 
  confirming the complainant's credibility includes the following circumstances: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the complainant's evidence of what she had to drink prior to arriving at 
    the second bar; the evidence of the appellant as to the complainant's drinking 
    at the bar; and Officer Newton's evidence as to the complainant's intoxication.</li>
  <li>the complainant's recollection of certain details was confirmed: she testified 
    that the door to the basement washroom did not close all the way and the bar 
    owner confirmed this; that the appellant did not say anything to her during 
    intercourse and the appellant confirmed this; that the appellant did something 
    to her breasts during intercourse and red dots were noted on her right nipple; 
    that she was pushed up against the wall of the basement bathroom and this 
    was confirmed by a pink scratch on the right side of the complainant's back 
    and a dark and tender area below the scratch; that she thought the appellant 
    ejaculated during the incident was confirmed by the examination afterwards.</li>
  <li>the complainant's distraught emotional state immediately after the incident.</li>
</ul>
<p>[13] I now turn to the trial judge's alleged misapprehensions of the evidence. 
  As stated by Doherty J.A. in Morrissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 221: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If an appellant can demonstrate that the conviction depends on a misapprehension 
  of the evidence then, in my view, it must follow that the appellant has not 
  received a fair trial, and was the victim of a miscarriage of justice. This 
  is so even if the evidence as actually adduced at trial was capable of supporting 
  a conviction. </p>
<p>
  [14] For the reasons that follow, I am of the opinion that when the cumulative 
  effect of the misapprehensions is considered the appellant has met the test 
  in this case. The misapprehensions of the evidence are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1. After outlining the complainant's evidence and the appellant's evidence the 
  trial judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The complainant testified that the idea of engaging in sexual intercourse during 
  menstruation was repugnant. Also, she said, "Why would I want to have sex 
  in the basement of a bar on the Danforth?"</p>
<p>
  The complainant did not testify that she would not have consented to sex in 
  the basement of a bar. </p>
<p>
  [15] After rejecting the appellant's evidence and finding that it did not raise 
  a reasonable doubt, the trial judge accepted the complainant's evidence. He 
  noted it was convincing and, in accepting her evidence, referred to her explanation 
  that "she would not consent to sex while menstruating, nor in any case 
  to stand up sex in the basement of a bar." </p>
<p>
  [16] No issue is taken with the trial judge's reliance on the complainant's 
  explanation that she found even the idea of sexual intercourse while menstruating 
  repulsive. The second explanation, an incorrect quotation of the appellant's 
  evidence, was relied on by the trial judge and was central to his reason for 
  conviction.</p>
<p> [17] The respondent submits that the trial judge's quotation was in fact a 
  reasonable summary of the complainant's evidence. In support of this submission 
  the respondent points out that when the complainant was asked whether she was 
  amazed that the appellant managed to penetrate her standing up in the small 
  area of the bathroom, she responded, "I don't think about it. No. I don't think 
  about it. If the thought crosses my mind it's only repulsion that I feel." The 
  complainant's evidence indicated that she felt repulsion when she thought about 
  the logistics of stand-up sex in the small basement bathroom of the bar.</p>
<p>
  [18] The evidence relied on by the Crown is that the complainant was repulsed 
  at the very idea of what occurred as well as its location. The trial judge could 
  have accepted this evidence but that is not what he said. The query, "Why 
  would I have sex in a bar on the Danforth?" is really a way of saying that 
  the complainant said she had no motive to engage in sexual intercourse with 
  the appellant. That is not what she said. </p>
<p>
  2. The second alleged misapprehension of the evidence is with respect to the 
  trial judge's summary of the events that led to the incident. The trial judge 
  stated, "She had just finished her business (going to the bathroom) when 
  she says that the accused came in and raped her up against the wall." As 
  the passage quoted above indicates the complainant said she "went to use 
  the toilet". Whether the complainant had finished using the toilet was 
  not central to the trial judge's reasoning process. What is important however 
  is that the complainant could not remember what happened immediately before 
  she discovered the appellant was having sexual intercourse with her. Although 
  it is obvious that the accused came into the bathroom or he could not have been 
  having sex with her there, the complainant had no recollection that the appellant 
  came into the bathroom. </p>
<p>
  [19] The respondent submits that given the emphasis placed on blackouts during 
  the trial, the trial judge was aware that the complainant could not remember 
  what happened immediately prior to discovering the intercourse and his reasons 
  as a whole demonstrate this. Just prior to this impugned portion, the trial 
  judge noted that the complainant could not remember much of what happened at 
  the bar. He stated, that at the bar, "She engaged in idle conversation 
  and she went in and out of consciousness." </p>
<p>
  [20] Whether the complainant remembered what happened immediately prior to discovering 
  the intercourse was critical to the trial judge's assessment of her credibility 
  that she did not consent to intercourse with the appellant. If the complainant 
  was blacked out and had no recollection of how the intercourse began, the complainant 
  may have been incapable of consenting to intercourse. That, however, is not 
  the same as reciting evidence to the effect that she did remember what happened 
  and did not consent.</p>
<p>
  [21] In his recitation of events at the hospital, the trial judge concluded: 
  "At Women's College Hospital, [the complainant] exhibited the customary 
  emotional effects of a rape victim." The respondent concedes that once 
  again the trial judge used inaccurate language. The nurse at the hospital testified 
  that the complainant was tired, depressed, worried, anxious and scared. She 
  never suggested that these were typical symptoms of having been sexually assaulted. 
  As a result the appellant submits that the trial judge erroneously relied on 
  her evidence as confirming the complainant's credibility. The respondent points 
  out that the trial judge was entitled to rely on evidence of the appellant's 
  demeanour and that the police officer who picked her up from the telephone booth 
  noted that she was crying and "quite hysterical" while speaking on 
  the telephone and that she continued to cry on the ride to the station, as well 
  as at the hospital. Again, this evidence was capable of supporting a conviction 
  but the trial judge did not rely on the police officer's evidence.</p>
<p>
  [22] Having regard to the number and extent of the trial judge's misapprehensions 
  of evidence, I am not prepared to say that in totality they did not affect the 
  trial judge's reasoning process and that his decision would inevitably have 
  been the same. Accordingly we would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction 
  and direct a new trial.</p>
<p>In view of our conclusion it is not necessary to deal with the other grounds 
  of appeal.</p>
