<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Mary Anne Sanderson of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated October 20, 2003.</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  GOUDGE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant Andrea Torchia and her husband Angelo Torchia lived in Rockwood, 
  Ontario in a house which was destroyed by fire on February 28, 1997. The appellant 
  was the sole owner of the house. </p>
<p>
  [2] As a result of the fire, Mr. Torchia was convicted of arson with intent 
  to defraud the insurer on February 28, 2000. There is nothing in the material 
  to suggest that the appellant had anything to do with her husband's actions. 
  </p>
<p>
  [3] When the appellant's claim under her homeowner's policy was denied by the 
  respondent Royal &amp; SunAlliance Insurance Company of Canada, she commenced 
  this action. Sanderson J. allowed the respondent's motion for summary judgment, 
  finding that the exclusion clause in the property damage section of the policy 
  was clear and unambiguous and that it excluded the appellant's claim because 
  the loss resulted from the intentional or criminal act of her husband who was 
  a person insured by the policy.</p>
<p>
  [4] For the reasons that follow I agree with this conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [5] The appellant is the named insured under the policy. Her husband is not 
  a named insured. </p>
<p>
  [6] The following provisions of the policy are relevant to this dispute: </p>
<p class="indent">DEFINITIONS OF TERMS</p>
<p class="indent">USED THROUGHOUT THE POLICY</p>
<p class="indent">You and your mean the person(s) named as Insured on the Coverage 
  Summary page and, while living in the same household: </p>
<p class="indent"><li> his or her wife or husband[.]</li>
<p>
  [7] In the Property Coverages section of the policy, the insured perils are 
  described as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  You are insured against All Risks of direct physical loss or damage subject 
  to the exclusions and conditions of this policy[.]</p>
<p>
  [8] In the same section the relevant portion of the exclusion clause is this: </p>
<p class="indent">
  We do not insure loss or damage: </p>
<p class="center">
  &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 3. resulting from the intentional or criminal acts of, or the 
  failure to act by,</p>
<p class="indent">a) any person insured by this policy, or</p>
<p class="indent">b) any other person at the direction of any person insured by 
  this policy[.]</p>
<p>
  [9] In this court the appellant conceded that Mr. Torchia is a person insured 
  by this policy. Because of the policy's definition of "you" that concession 
  is appropriate.</p>
<p>
  [10] However, the appellant argues that there is an ambiguity in the exclusion 
  clause which must be interpreted against the insurer. The clause could exclude 
  either the loss of any insured resulting from the intentional or criminal act 
  of a person insured by the policy or only a loss suffered by the person who 
  committed the act. The latter interpretation would put the loss suffered by 
  Mrs. Torchia beyond the reach of the exclusion clause and Mrs. Torchia would 
  be entitled to recover under the policy. </p>
<p>
  [11] In making this argument the appellant relies heavily on Snaak (Litigation 
  Guardian of) v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co. (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 
  230 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [12] In my view the appellant's argument cannot succeed given the wording of 
  the exclusion clause. </p>
<p>
  [13] There is no doubt that exclusion clauses are to be construed narrowly and 
  that any ambiguity must be construed against the insurer. However, this clause 
  is clear and unambiguous. It excludes losses suffered by any person insured 
  by the policy which result from the intentional or criminal acts of an insured 
  person. There is no language to suggest that the exclusion is confined to a 
  loss suffered by the insured who commits the intentional or criminal act. That 
  meaning could be achieved only by adding limiting words to the exclusion clause. 
  There is no ambiguity in the wording of this exclusion clause. Since the appellant 
  has advanced no other basis for departing from its clear meaning, the exclusion 
  clause must be given effect as written.</p>
<p>
  [14] Nor, in my view, is Snaak of any assistance to the appellant. In that case 
  the question was whether the homeowners were protected against damage caused 
  by the intentional act of their son who was also insured under the policy. This 
  court found the exclusion clause in that case to be ambiguous, excluding either 
  coverage for all insureds for damage caused by the intentional act of one insured 
  or excluding only coverage for the insured committing the intentional act.</p>
<p>
  [15] There were two bases for the finding of ambiguity. First, the policy contained 
  a "separate coverage" provision in these terms: "Coverage applies 
  separately to each person who is insured". As found by this court in Godonoaga 
  (Litigation guardian of) v. Khatambakhsh (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 22 (C.A.), such 
  a clause could lead an insured to expect coverage except where his loss was 
  due to his own intentional or criminal act.</p>
<p>
  [16] Second, this court in Snaak relied on the wording of the exclusion clause 
  itself. In that case it read as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  This policy does not apply to</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;..</p>
<p class="indent"> 10. INTENTIONAL OR CRIMINAL ACTS, meaning bodily injury or 
  property damage resulting from: </p>
<p class="indent">
  -- an intentional or criminal act by any person or any named insured who is 
  insured by this policy, &#133;.</p>
<p>
  [17] In both respects, Snaak is different from this case. Neither basis for 
  ambiguity exists in this case. First, there is no "separate coverage" 
  provision applicable to the property coverage in the appellant's policy.</p>
<p>
  [18] Second, the exclusion clause in Snaak focuses first on the nature of the 
  act and the actor triggering the exclusion. This may leave the possible implication 
  that only the coverage accorded to that actor but to no other insured is excluded. 
  The exclusion clause in this case is differently worded. It focuses first on 
  the loss or damage excluded. It does so in language which can leave no implication 
  that only the loss of the particular insured who commits the intentional or 
  criminal act is excluded.</p>
<p>
  [19] Thus, I conclude that the exclusion clause here is clear and unambiguous 
  and that Snaak is of no assistance to the appellant.</p>
<p>
  [20] I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondent on a 
  partial indemnity basis fixed at $5,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.
