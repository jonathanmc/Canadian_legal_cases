<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] We reject the appellant's submission that the trial judge failed to take 
  account of relevant evidence relating to the appellant's personal circumstances 
  and that he failed to properly balance the appropriate factors relevant to whether 
  a conditional sentence should be imposed. </p>
<p>[2] In our view, the trial judge identified the most significant mitigating 
  factors favouring the appellant including steps the appellant had taken relating 
  to his alcohol abuse and his plea of guilty. Despite those factors, the trial 
  judge concluded that a conditional sentence was not appropriate based on factors 
  that included the appellant's failure to take responsibility for his offence 
  and lack of sincere remorse. We see no error in his conclusion. </p>
<p>[3] Further, the offences in issue involved sexual touching of the appellant's 
  teenage stepdaughters. Given the nature of the offences, the number of incidents 
  involving the oldest girl, and the period during which those incidents occurred, 
  we do not consider that the trial judge mischaracterized the seriousness of 
  the offences, overemphasized denunciation and deterrence or that the total sentence 
  was outside the appropriate range.</p>
<p>[4] Leave to appeal sentence is granted, but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
