<p>An application seeking production of certain documentation in connection with 
  appeals pending from convictions entered by a jury presided over by Mr. Justice 
  Alfred J. Stong of the Ontario Court of Justice (Gen. Div.) on June 12, 1998.</p>
<p>
  DOHERTY J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] Marco Trotta, an appellant in a pending appeal, sought an order requiring 
  the Crown to produce certain material in its possession. Anisa Trotta, a co-accused 
  and appellant in the same proceedings, supported the application. The court 
  reserved judgment at the end of oral argument and subsequently advised counsel 
  that the application was dismissed with reasons to follow. These are those reasons.</p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  [2] Eight-month old Paulo Trotta died on May 20, 1993. Dr. David Chan performed 
  an autopsy and concluded that his death was attributable to Sudden Infant Death 
  Syndrome (SIDS). About a year after Paulo's death, his one-month old brother, 
  Marco Jr., was admitted to hospital with a fractured femur. Hospital personnel 
  suspected that Marco Jr. had been physically abused. The authorities opened 
  an investigation into Marco's injuries and also decided to re-examine the death 
  of Paulo. Paulo's body was exhumed and a second autopsy was performed by Dr. 
  Randal Smith. This autopsy and related investigations revealed various injuries 
  to Paulo, including three skull fractures. Dr. Smith could not identify a specific 
  cause of death, however, in his view, death was consistent with brain edema 
  due to brain injury and asphyxiation caused either by the brain injury or to 
  mechanical asphyxiation. Dr. Smith rejected the diagnosis of SIDS and testified 
  that in the absence of a credible explanation for the injuries, he assumed that 
  the death was not accidental.</p>
<p>
  [3] The police charged the applicant, Paulo's father, with murder, aggravated 
  assault and assault causing bodily harm. They charged Anisa Trotta, Paulo's 
  mother, with manslaughter, criminal negligence causing death and failure to 
  provide the necessaries of life. It was the Crown's position that Paulo's numerous 
  injuries were inflicted by his father at different times, and that his mother 
  knew or should have known of the assaults, but failed to take action to protect 
  Paulo because of her devotion to her husband, Marco.</p>
<p>
  [4] The jury convicted the applicant on all charges. They acquitted Anisa Trotta 
  on the manslaughter charge, but convicted her on the other two charges. Both 
  have appealed their convictions to this court. </p>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  The Nature of the Application</p>
<p>
  [5] The perfection of these appeals was delayed for various reasons. They have 
  now been perfected and are scheduled to be heard in May of this year. Counsel 
  for the appellants have been in correspondence with Crown counsel for quite 
  some time concerning production of material in the possession of the Crown relating 
  to various reviews or comments that have been made regarding Dr. Smith's competency 
  as a paediatric pathologist and his objectivity as a Crown witness in a number 
  of criminal investigations. The appellants intend to bring an application to 
  adduce fresh evidence on the appeal challenging Dr. Smith's competency and objectivity. 
  As I understand it, they propose to lead evidence demonstrating that his work 
  in other cases was not competent and that he was biased in favour of the Crown 
  in other cases. The appellants will argue that this evidence renders his opinion 
  evidence in this case unreliable. </p>
<p>
  [6] By notice of application dated November 4, 2003, Marco Trotta (the "applicant") 
  moved before Sharpe J.A. for an order requiring production of certain material 
  in possession of the Crown and/or the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario 
  (the "Coroner"). Although the notice of application did not expressly 
  say so, it was common ground that the applicant sought production of material 
  to assist him in his efforts to gather fresh evidence to challenge the competency 
  and objectivity of Dr. Smith. Sharpe J.A. held that a judge of the court did 
  not have jurisdiction to make the order sought. He referred the application 
  to a panel of the court and gave various directions, including requiring the 
  notification of third parties whose privacy interests would be affected by a 
  disclosure order. </p>
<p>
  [7] When the application came on for hearing in January 2004, the applicant 
  had not filed any motion to adduce fresh evidence on the appeal. The court was 
  advised by counsel for the applicant that the applicant would be pursuing a 
  fresh evidence application targeting the credibility and reliability of Dr. 
  Smith's evidence regardless of the outcome of this application.</p>
<p> [8] The applicant seeks material that falls into one of two categories: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Materials associated with reviews of Dr. Smith's work in 17 criminal matters 
    conducted at the request of the Attorney General's Department. In all cases, 
    the Coroner's office did an internal review and, in some cases, an external 
    review was also performed.</li>
  <li>Material provided by Crown attorneys in response to inquiries from the Attorney 
    General's Department as to any concerns the Crown Attorneys had arising out 
    of Dr. Smith's participation in any criminal investigations or prosecutions.</li>
</ul>
<p> [9] The material in the first category described above was ordered produced 
  in November 2002 by Trafford J. in R. v. Kporwodu and Veno.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1"></a> 
  In that case, Dr. Smith had performed an autopsy on the three-month old deceased. 
  His opinion as to the timing of certain injuries was crucial to the decision 
  to charge the accused with murder. Counsel for Kporwodu and Veno sought disclosure 
  of the material generated as a result of the internal and external reviews of 
  Dr. Smith's performance in other criminal matters. The Crown resisted production. 
  Trafford J. held that the material was producible under the principles enunciated 
  in R. v. Stinchcombe (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). </p>
<p>
  [10] The materials referred to in the second category were voluntarily produced 
  to the defence by the Crown in R. v. Kporwodu and Veno.</p>
<p>
  [11] Mr. Lomer, counsel for the applicant, submitted that the applicant is in 
  the same position as were Mr. Kporwodu and Mr. Veno and that this court should 
  make the same order that Trafford J. made. He contends that Dr. Smith's evidence 
  was important evidence at trial. The Crown relied on his opinions to support 
  the position that Paulo's death was a culpable homicide. Counsel argues that 
  if there is good reason to doubt those opinions, there is good reason to doubt 
  the validity of the convictions.</p>
<p>
  [12] Mr. Lomer concedes that Dr. Smith's competency and objectivity were not 
  attacked at trial. He argues that developments since 1998 place Dr. Smith's 
  competency and objectivity in a very different light. Counsel points out that 
  since the fall of 1999, there has been a growing body of public, judicial and 
  medical opinion casting doubt on Dr. Smith's competency as a paediatric pathologist 
  and his objectivity as a Crown witness. Some of that material is referred to 
  by Trafford J. in R. v. Kporwodu and Veno and some of it is found in the material 
  filed in support of the application. </p>
<p>
  [13] Counsel submits that the material he seeks produced may provide evidence 
  of Dr. Smith's competency or objectivity, or may lead to such evidence. He argues 
  that the principles in R v. Stinchcombe, supra, govern the Crown's disclosure 
  obligation on appeal and that under those principles any information in the 
  possession of the Crown which may assist the applicant in challenging Dr. Smith's 
  credibility must be produced to the defence unless protected by some recognized 
  privilege or some overriding third party interest: see R. v. O'Connor (1996), 
  103 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). </p>
<p>
  [14] Counsel correctly points out that the Crown has not advanced any privilege 
  claim. He seeks to avoid any complications that may arise from third party claims 
  by abandoning for the present, at least, any claim to production of any material 
  that is subject to a third party privacy claim that has not been waived on this 
  application. </p>
<p>
  [15] Counsel for the applicant acknowledges that he will ultimately have to 
  convince the court that it is in the interests of justice to receive fresh evidence 
  going to the competency and objectivity of Dr. Smith. He accepts that at that 
  stage, the factors identified in R. v. Palmer, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 will become 
  important. He maintains, however, that the ultimate admissibility of any of 
  the material he seeks produced has no bearing on whether the Crown is obliged 
  to produce it to him. It is his position that he need only show that the material 
  sought could potentially offer some assistance to the applicant in the pursuit 
  of his fresh evidence application.</p>
<p>
  [16] Counsel for Kporwodu and Veno appeared on the application. They are in 
  possession of copies of the material that the applicant wants. They properly 
  take the position that they hold the material subject to an undertaking that 
  they will use it only in the defence of their own clients. They cannot produce 
  it to counsel for the applicant without a court order. Counsel for Kporwodu 
  and Veno take no position on the merits of the application, but offered to provide 
  whatever assistance the court might request either on the application, or in 
  connection with any order to produce the court might make. Counsel helpfully 
  advised the court that their copies of the material have been organized and 
  indexed to facilitate access.</p>
<p>
  [17] Counsel for the Coroner appeared on the motion to ensure that the court 
  appreciated the sensitive and personal nature of some of the information contained 
  in the material sought by the applicant. The material includes autopsy reports, 
  other medical records, and information from various social service agencies. 
  Counsel for the Coroner stressed that privacy interests of third parties, including 
  parents of deceased children, had to be considered before the court could order 
  production of the material sought by the applicant. Counsel contacted several 
  individuals with potential privacy interests. Some had waived those interests, 
  others had asserted those interests, and still others did not reply to the Coroner's 
  inquiry. </p>
<p>
  [18] I agree that there are very difficult and important privacy issues raised 
  by the production request as initially framed by the applicant. However, as 
  indicated above, the applicant abandoned his request for production of any material 
  that could be subject to a third party privacy claim unless that claim has been 
  waived. For present purposes, the difficult issues flagged by Coroner's counsel 
  do not arise and nothing said in the rest of these reasons is intended to address 
  a situation in which third party interests must be considered.</p>
<p> [19] The Crown opposed the application. Crown counsel did not suggest that 
  the Crown did not have disclosure obligations at the appellate stage of the 
  criminal process. She submitted, however, that before the Crown could be required 
  to produce material in relation to an appeal, the applicant must offer some 
  ground upon which the requested material could be admitted as fresh evidence 
  on the appeal. Counsel forcefully argued that any attempt to challenge Dr. Smith's 
  competency and objectivity by way of evidence questioning his competency and 
  objectivity in other cases could not possibly be admitted as fresh evidence 
  on this appeal absent some reason to doubt the accuracy of the medical opinions 
  he gave in this case. Counsel stressed that the applicant has had five years 
  since his trial to seek and obtain medical evidence challenging any part of 
  Dr. Smith's opinion. The applicant has offered no such evidence.<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2"></a> 
  Crown counsel submitted that this application for production has delayed what 
  is already a long overdue appeal. She contended that an order requiring production 
  would only cause further delay with no real prospect that it would generate 
  any evidence which would be admitted on appeal.</p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  The Disclosure Obligation</p>
<p>
  [20] The Crown is obliged to make timely disclosure to an accused of all relevant 
  information in the Crown's possession: R. v. Stinchcombe, supra, at pp. 9-12. 
  Relevant information refers to any information that there is a reasonable possibility 
  may assist the accused in any aspect of the exercise of the right to make full 
  answer and defence: R. v. Chaplin (1995), 96 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at 233-34 (S.C.C.); 
  R. v. Dixon (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 11-12 (S.C.C.). Any information that 
  clears this low relevance hurdle must be disclosed by the Crown unless the Crown 
  can establish a privilege that precludes disclosure: Stinchcombe, supra.</p>
<p>
  [21] The heavy disclosure obligation placed on the Crown is necessary to give 
  full vitality to an accused's right to make full answer and defence as protected 
  under s. 7 of the Charter. Full, generous and timely disclosure protects against 
  wrongful convictions. As Sopinka J. said in Stinchcombe at p. 9: </p>
<p class="indent">
  &#133; There is the overriding concern that failure to disclose impedes the 
  ability of the accused to make full answer and defence. This common law right 
  has acquired new vigor by virtue of its inclusion in s. 7 of the Canadian Charter 
  of Rights and Freedoms as one of the principles of fundamental justice [citations 
  omitted]. The right to make full answer and defence is one of the pillars of 
  criminal justice on which we heavily depend to ensure the innocent are not convicted. 
  </p>
<p>
  [22] The disclosure jurisprudence arises out of the pre-verdict phase of the 
  criminal process. I see no reason why the Crown's disclosure obligations should 
  not continue through the appellate process. The protection of the innocent is 
  as important on appeal as it is prior to conviction. </p>
<p>
  [23] While the nature of the Crown's disclosure obligation and its rationale 
  remain constant after conviction, the resolution of disclosure disputes on appeal 
  will require a somewhat different analytical framework than that described in 
  Stinchcombe. There are at least two reasons for this different approach. A convicted 
  accused is no longer presumed innocent. In fact, the opposite is presumed. The 
  conviction stands unless the appellant can convince the appeal court that it 
  should be set aside. A convicted person has also exhausted his or her right 
  to make full answer and defence. It is inappropriate at the appellate stage 
  to speak either of the presumption of innocence or the right to make full answer 
  and defence. It is equally inappropriate to describe the boundaries of the Crown's 
  disclosure obligation on appeal by reference to the presumption of innocence 
  or an accused's right to make full answer and defence. </p>
<p>
  [24] An accused does, however, have broad rights of appeal under the Criminal 
  Code. These include not only legal and factual challenges arising out of the 
  trial record, but also the right to adduce fresh evidence under s. 683(1) if 
  the interests of justice so require. The broad rights of appeal, the power to 
  receive fresh evidence, and the court's wide remedial powers are all designed 
  to maximize protection against wrongful convictions. </p>
<p> [25] The Crown's disclosure obligation on appeal must recognize and give full 
  value to an accused's broad rights of appeal and the rationale underlying those 
  rights. The Crown's disclosure obligation on appeal must extend to any information 
  in the possession of the Crown that there is a reasonable possibility may assist 
  the accused in the prosecution of his or her appeal.<a href="#a">[3]</a><a name="3"></a> 
  In the present case, the applicant seeks disclosure in aid of a proposed fresh 
  evidence motion. To obtain production, the applicant must first demonstrate 
  a connection between the request for production and the fresh evidence he proposes 
  to adduce. The applicant must show that there is a reasonable possibility that 
  the material sought could assist on the motion to adduce fresh evidence. By 
  assist, I mean yield material that will be admissible as fresh evidence, or 
  assist the applicant in developing or obtaining material that will be admissible 
  as fresh evidence. The applicant must next demonstrate that there is some reasonable 
  possibility that the evidence to which the production request is linked may 
  be received as fresh evidence on appeal. Unless the appellant can make both 
  links, there is no reasonable possibility that the material sought could assist 
  in the prosecution of the appeal and consequently, no reason for this court 
  to require the Crown to disclose it.</p>
<p>
  [26] In assessing whether the applicant has made the first link, that is some 
  connection between the material sought and the evidence proposed to be adduced 
  on appeal, the applicant will often have limited knowledge of the contents of 
  the material. The court will bear this disadvantage in mind in determining whether 
  the applicant has established the necessary link. In this case, that difficulty 
  does not arise. The applicant has a very good idea of the nature, if not the 
  specifics, of the content of the material he seeks. </p>
<p>
  [27] I am satisfied that the applicant has demonstrated a link between the material 
  he seeks produced and evidence that would challenge Dr. Smith's competence as 
  a paediatric pathologist and his objectivity when testifying for the Crown. 
  The applicant has shown that the material he seeks could provide evidence going 
  to either or both of these issues, or at least could provide material that would 
  assist in generating evidence that would be relevant to Dr. Smith's professional 
  competence and his objectivity. </p>
<p>
  [28] In considering whether the applicant has made the second link, that is 
  whether evidence of the kind he proposes to adduce could reasonably be received 
  on appeal, it is necessary to consider the principles governing the admission 
  of fresh evidence on appeal. At this stage, those principles are consulted not 
  to determine admissibility, but to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility 
  of admissibility. </p>
<p>
  [29] Section 683(1) of the Criminal Code provides that the court may receive 
  fresh evidence where it is "in the interests of justice". Criteria 
  to be addressed in determining whether fresh evidence should be admitted are 
  well known and I need not repeat them here: see R. v. Palmer, supra. I will 
  refer to only one of those criteria. Fresh evidence will not be received unless 
  considered with the rest of the evidence adduced at trial, it could reasonably 
  be expected to affect the verdict. This only makes sense. Evidence which is 
  not sufficiently cogent to give cause for concern over the verdict serves no 
  purpose at the appellate stage. </p>
<p>
  [30] Dr. Smith testified that the weight of Paulo's brain as recorded by Dr. 
  Chan (940 grams) was well beyond the normal brain weight for an infant of Paulo's 
  age and size. Dr. Smith further testified that the weight of the brain indicated 
  brain edema or swelling, a non-specific response to injury or a disease process. 
  Dr. Smith noted that Dr. Chan had not observed any disease process. According 
  to Dr. Smith, if disease was excluded, brain edema could be caused by trauma 
  to the brain or asphyxia. Asphyxia could be the product of brain injury or some 
  unrelated cause such as strangulation. Dr. Smith opined that a brain injury 
  was the most likely cause of the brain edema. In reaching this conclusion, he 
  referred to the three skull fractures revealed by the x-rays, two of which occurred 
  at least four months before Paulo's death, but one of which occurred some time 
  between a couple of days before Paulo's death and ten minutes before his death. 
  Dr. Smith said that this third fracture could have caused a lethal injury. </p>
<p>
  [31] In his report, Dr. Smith wrote that the cause of death was "undetermined". 
  In cross-examination, he indicated that he could not identify the cause of death 
  with any certainty. In re-examination, he was asked whether he could exclude 
  any possible causes of death. He replied: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I don't have any evidence of natural disease to explain Paulo's death. If I 
  accept the history that you gave me, that is that he was seemingly well at 7:00 
  in the morning and dead at 7:30 or in extremis such that he ultimately died 
  a little while afterwards, if that's true - and here once again you understand 
  how frustrating this is because I don't know. There's a whole series of things 
  I don't know whether they're true or not true. If that's true, then I have to 
  regard Paulo's death as being non-accidental in nature unless an alternate credible 
  explanation is given.</p>
<p>
  [32] Dr. Smith was skilfully cross-examined at trial. No attempt was made to 
  challenge his competency or his objectivity. Specifically, no attempt was made 
  to challenge his medical opinion concerning Paulo's brain weight or the medical 
  conclusions that he drew from that weight. Instead, counsel established that 
  Dr. Smith's opinion depended in large measure on the observations that had been 
  made by Dr. Chan. Using Dr. Smith's expertise, counsel then attempted to demonstrate 
  that Dr. Chan's observations were unreliable and his competence as a paediatric 
  pathologist doubtful.</p>
<p>
  [33] In cross-examination, Dr. Smith acknowledged that Dr. Chan had made numerous 
  errors during the autopsy. Dr. Smith criticized several aspects of the autopsy, 
  including the basic techniques used by Dr. Chan, his failure to follow certain 
  procedures relating to the examination of the brain, and his absence from the 
  autopsy room when Paulo's skull was first opened for examination. Dr. Smith 
  also agreed that Dr. Chan had failed to observe injuries which Dr. Smith said 
  were obvious (e.g. the fractures to the skull), and had made no observations 
  of symptoms that were commonly associated with cerebral edema. Dr. Smith indicated 
  that these symptoms should have been obvious if they were present at the time 
  of the first autopsy.</p>
<p>
  [34] During cross-examination, counsel also established that Dr. Smith could 
  not identify a specific cause of death because of the many questions left unresolved 
  by the first autopsy. </p>
<p>
  [35] The applicant's factum filed on appeal does not raise grounds of appeal 
  that challenge the competency of Dr. Smith as a paediatric pathologist. Three 
  of the grounds of appeal arise out of Dr. Smith's evidence. The first alleges 
  that the trial judge misstated Dr. Smith's evidence as to the cause of death 
  when summarizing his evidence. This allegation has nothing to do with Dr. Smith's 
  competence or objectivity.</p>
<p>
  [36] The other two grounds of appeal involving Dr. Smith's evidence contend 
  that Dr. Smith erroneously placed an onus on the accused to establish a non-culpable 
  cause of death and that he engaged in prejudicial speculation in describing 
  certain hypothetical scenarios that may have led to Paulo's death. These allegations 
  could suggest a bias on Dr. Smith's part in favour of the Crown. I do not see, 
  however, how evidence that Dr. Smith displayed a Crown bias in other cases could 
  possibly assist in advancing these grounds of appeal. The trial record speaks 
  for itself. Either Dr. Smith improperly placed an onus on the accused or he 
  did not, and either Dr. Smith speculated in a prejudicial manner or he did not. 
  The answer to these questions and their impact on the convictions lies in a 
  review of the trial transcript and not in what Dr. Smith did or did not do in 
  other unrelated cases. </p>
<p>
  [37] I agree with Crown counsel's submission that it is significant that the 
  applicant has offered no evidence to suggest that any of the opinions given 
  by Dr. Smith in this case are open to legitimate debate. Absent such evidence, 
  I do not see how a reasonable trier of fact could possibly find the opinions 
  given by Dr. Smith in this case to be unreliable based on his conduct in other 
  cases. The medical opinions advanced by Dr. Smith in this case are quite limited. 
  It may be that from a medical perspective they are sufficiently elementary to 
  be beyond dispute. Certainly, the applicant has offered nothing to suggest that 
  Dr. Smith's medical opinions in this case are in any way controversial. The 
  manner in which Dr. Smith chose to express those opinions is a subject of controversy 
  on the appeal, but would not be illuminated by evidence of his conduct in other 
  cases.</p>
<p>
  [38] I am satisfied that absent any basis upon which to doubt Dr. Smith's opinion 
  in this case, evidence questioning his competence and objectivity in other cases 
  could not possibly affect the verdict in this case and, consequently, could 
  not be received as fresh evidence on appeal.</p>
<p>
  IV</p>
<p>
  [39] One additional comment is in order. Counsel made it clear that the applicant 
  would attempt to lead fresh evidence regardless of the outcome of this application. 
  The court was not provided with the proposed fresh evidence or any indication 
  as to the specific nature of that evidence. As this request for production was 
  in aid of a motion to adduce fresh evidence, it would have been helpful for 
  the court to have the proposed fresh evidence or at least some indication as 
  to the form in which the applicant proposed to place fresh evidence before the 
  court. Had I been inclined to order production, I would have required the applicant 
  to produce the fresh evidence that we are told will be tendered regardless of 
  the outcome of this application so that I could assure myself that the fresh 
  evidence application did warrant the production requested. </p>
<p>
  [40] The application for production is dismissed.</p>
