<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The Reverend Brother Walter A. Tucker appeals from the orders of Herold 
  J. dated May 13, 2003 and October 6, 2003, dismissing the appellant's motions 
  to set aside an earlier order of Judge McNeely dated June 21, 1983. </p>
<p>
  [2] No one appeared for Steetley Industries Limited, which no longer owns the 
  lands that are the subject matter of those proceedings. Counsel responded on 
  behalf of Hamilton Region Conservation Authority, which is the current owner, 
  and which was granted intervener status by Justice Herold.</p>
<p>
  [3] Judge McNeely's order terminated Reverend Brother Tucker's tenancy on property 
  in the Guelph area. The property was owned by Steetley Industries Limited (formerly 
  Canada Crushed and Cut Stone Limited). By supplementary letters patent dated 
  April 24, 1969, Canada Crushed and Cut Stone Limited had changed its name to 
  Steetley Industries Limited. These supplementary letters patent, however, were 
  not registered on title against the lands until 1987. Judge McNeely's order 
  was appealed to the Divisional Court, but the appeal was dismissed as abandoned. 
  These issues went to the Supreme Court of Canada where the application for leave 
  to appeal was dismissed. Reverend Brother Tucker was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
  [4] In 1985, Reverend Brother Tucker sought to set aside a writ of prohibition 
  and to quash the writ of possession issued pursuant to the order of Judge McNeely. 
  Justice Reid dismissed that motion. This court dismissed an appeal from Justice 
  Reid's order and an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of 
  Canada was dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [5] In 1987, Steetley Industries sold the lands to the Hamilton Region Conservation 
  Authority. Although the appellant knew at the latest in 1985 that Canada Crushed 
  and Cut Stone Limited had changed its name to Steetley Industries Limited and 
  that Steetley Industries was not "the paper title holder of the land", 
  he did not bring the application that gives rise to this appeal until April 
  2003. The application is based on the argument that Steetley Industries fraudulently 
  obtained the order from Judge McNeely terminating the tenancy because the lands 
  were not registered in its name at the time of the application and, therefore, 
  Steetley Industries did not have authority to apply to terminate the tenancy. 
  </p>
<p>
  [6] Justice Herold rejected this argument in careful reasons and dismissed the 
  motion. Then, at the request of the Reverend Brother Tucker, he held a rehearing 
  and dealt with the matter again, dismissing the motion a second time. </p>
<p>
  [7] We see no error in Herold J.'s reasons or in his conclusions. At all relevant 
  times prior to the sale to the Hamilton Regional Conservation Authority in 1987, 
  the lands were owned by the same corporate entity. All that happened was that 
  the corporate name was changed from Canada Crushed and Cut Stone Limited to 
  Steetley Industries Limited. The fact that the name change was not registered 
  on title was not a bar to the commencement of the application before Judge McNeely, 
  nor did it constitute a fraud on the court. Justice Herold was therefore correct 
  in dismissing the motion.</p>
<p>
  [8] The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [9] Costs to the respondent fixed at $3,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
