<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Bruce C. Hawkins of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated October 11, 2002. </p>
<p>
  BORINS J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] This is an appeal by the United States of America from the judgment of Hawkins 
  J. dismissing an application to extradite the respondent. It is the appellant's 
  position that the extradition judge erred in his interpretation and application 
  of s. 29(1)(a) of the Extradition Act, S.C. 1999, c. 18. The respondent concedes 
  this position. However, in reliance on United States of America v. Drysdale 
  (2000), 71 C.R.R. (2d) 133 (Ont. Sup. Ct.), the respondent submits that the 
  extradition judge &quot;reached the correct result despite [his] error&quot; 
  in his interpretation of s. 29(1)(a). For the reasons that follow, I would reject 
  the respondent's submission and allow the appeal. </p>
<p>
  [2] Although the respondent has conceded the appellant's ground of appeal, it 
  is helpful to consider it as the reasons the extradition judge erred apply to 
  my analysis of the respondent's position. To provide the appropriate context 
  for my analysis, I will set out the relevant provisions of the Extradition Act, 
  a summary of the facts based on the findings of the extradition judge and the 
  reasons of the extradition judge. </p>
<p>
  The Extradition Act</p>
<p>
  [3] The following provisions of the Act are relevant to this appeal: </p>
<p class="indent"> 3. (1) A person may be extradited from Canada in accordance 
  with this Act and a relevant extradition agreement on the request of an extradition 
  partner for the purpose of prosecuting the person or imposing a sentence on 
  or enforcing a sentence imposed on the person if</p>
<p class="indent">(a) subject to a relevant extradition agreement, the offence 
  in respect of which the extradition is requested is punishable by the extradition 
  partner, by imprisoning or otherwise depriving the person of their liberty for 
  a maximum term of two years or more, or by a more severe punishment; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the conduct of the person, had it occurred in Canada, would 
  have constituted an offence that is punishable in Canada,</p>
<p class="indent">(i) in the case of a request on a specific agreement, by imprisonment 
  for a maximum term of five years or more, or by a more severe punishment, and</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) in any other case, by imprisonment for a maximum term of 
  two years or more, or by a more severe punishment, subject to a relevant extradition 
  agreement.</p>
<p class="indent">5. A person may be extradited</p>
<p class="indent">(a) whether or not the conduct on which the extradition partner 
  bases its request occurred in the territory over which it has jurisdiction; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) whether or not Canada could exercise jurisdiction in similar 
  circumstances.</p>
<p class="indent">15.(1) The Minister [of Justice] may, after receiving a request 
  for extradition and being satisfied that the conditions set out in paragraph 
  3(1)(a) and subsection 3(3) are met in respect of one or more offences mentioned 
  in the request, issue an authority to proceed that authorizes the Attorney General 
  [of Canada] to seek, on behalf of the extradition partner, an order of a court 
  for the committal of the person under section 29.</p>
<p class="center">. . . </p>
<p class="indent">(3) The authority to proceed must contain</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the name or the description of the person whose extradition 
  is sought;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the name of the extradition partner; and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the name of the offence or offences under Canadian law that 
  correspond to the alleged conduct of the person or the conduct in respect of 
  which the person was convicted, as long as one of the offences would be punishable 
  in accordance with paragraph 3(1)(b).</p>
<p class="indent">29.(1) A judge shall order the committal of the person into 
  custody to await surrender if </p>
<p class="indent">(a) in the case of a person sought for prosecution, there is 
  evidence admissible under this Act of conduct that, had it occurred in Canada, 
  would justify committal for trial in Canada on the offence set out in the authority 
  to proceed and the judge is satisfied that the person is the person sought by 
  the extradition partner;</p>
<p class="indent">33.(1) The record of the case must include </p>
<p class="indent">(a) in the case of a person sought for the purpose of prosecution, 
  a document summarizing the evidence available to the extradition partner for 
  use in the prosecution;</p>
<p class="center">. . . . . </p>
<p class="indent">(3) A record of the case may not be admitted unless</p>
<p class="indent">(a) in the case of a person sought for the purpose of prosecution, 
  a judicial or prosecuting authority of the extradition partner certifies that 
  the evidence summarized or contained in the record of the case is available 
  for trial and</p>
<p class="indent">(i) is sufficient under the law of the extradition partner to 
  justify prosecution, or</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) was gathered according to the law of the extradition partner;</p>
<p class="indent">55.(1) On the hearing of an appeal against the discharge of 
  a person or against a stay of proceedings, the court of appeal may</p>
<p class="indent">(a) allow the appeal and set aside the order of discharge or 
  stay, if it is of the opinion</p>
<p class="indent">(i) that the order of discharge should be set aside on the ground 
  that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence,</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) that the order of discharge or the stay of proceedings 
  should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law, 
  or </p>
<p class="indent">(iii) that, on any ground, there was a miscarriage of justice; 
  or</p>
<p class="indent">(b) dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The court of appeal may, if it sets aside a stay of proceedings, 
  order a new extradition hearing. The court of appeal may, if it sets aside an 
  order of discharge, order a new extradition hearing or order the committal of 
  the person.</p>
<p>
  The Facts</p>
<p>
  [4] By way of an authority to proceed issued on April 5, 2000, pursuant to s. 
  15 of the Act, the Minister of Justice authorized the Attorney General of Canada, 
  on behalf of the United States of America (the &quot;extradition partner&quot;), 
  to seek an order of committal of the respondent, who was being sought for prosecution 
  by the United States. The Canadian offences that correspond to the conduct alleged 
  against the respondent, as set out in the authority to proceed, are: </p>
<p class="indent"> Conspiracy to traffic in cocaine (benzoylmethylecgonine) contrary 
  to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and section 465(1)(c) 
  of the Criminal Code of Canada; and</p>
<p class="indent">Conspiracy to possess cocaine (benzoylmethylecgonine) for the 
  purpose of trafficking contrary to section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and 
  Substances Act and section 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code of Canada.</p>
<p>
  [5] The United States seeks the respondent's extradition to stand trial in the 
  United States District Court on charges relating to his alleged membership in 
  a conspiracy whereby large quantities of cocaine were purchased in Florida and 
  then transported to Buffalo, New York and thereafter imported into Canada for 
  distribution there. </p>
<p>
  [6] It is alleged that Nestor Fonseca was the leader of the conspiracy. In furtherance 
  of the objects of the conspiracy, Fonseca utilized several co-conspirators who 
  traveled to the United States from Canada with money to purchase the cocaine 
  in Florida and then to smuggle the cocaine into Canada. After the cocaine entered 
  Canada, Fonseca took control of it and sold it to individuals in Canada, including 
  the respondent. Between March 27, 1998 and June 15, 1998, with the assistance 
  of his co-conspirators Fonseca imported approximately 50 kilograms of cocaine 
  into Canada in five different shipments. </p>
<p>
  [7] After the cocaine was in Canada, Fonseca met with the respondent in Toronto 
  on several occasions between April 20, 1998 and June 24, 1998 and sold him a 
  total of approximately 11 kilograms of cocaine. The fate of the rest of the 
  cocaine that Fonseca imported into Canada is unknown. The respondent's role 
  was limited to that of purchaser of part of the imported cocaine. All of the 
  respondent's conduct relevant to Fonseca's scheme occurred in Canada. The United 
  States does not allege that he participated in the purchase of the cocaine in 
  Florida, its transport from there to the United States/Canadian border, or its 
  importation into Canada.</p>
<p>
  The Decision of the Extradition Judge</p>
<p>
  [8] The extradition judge reviewed in considerable detail the evidence of the 
  conduct relied on by the United States in support of its request for the respondent's 
  extradition. Thereafter, he observed that &quot;reminders by our appellate courts 
  that extradition proceedings are meant to be straightforward, uncomplicated 
  and free from technicalities seem to have run aground of s. 29(1) of the present 
  Act to s. 18(1)(b) of the former Act&quot; (Extradition Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 
  E-23) because these &quot;sections appear to have nothing to do with situations 
  where the crime of which the person sought is alleged to be guilty was committed 
  in Canada&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [9] The extradition judge then referred to the statement of LaForest J., speaking 
  for the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in U.S.A. v. L&eacute;pine, 
  [1994], 1 S.C.R. 286 at 296, that &quot;there is nothing in the [former] Act 
  that requires that the judge consider where the acts charged took place&quot;. 
  However, it appears that he considered that L&eacute;pine had been overruled 
  on this point by the following passage defining the role of the extradition 
  judge in U.S.A. v. Dynar, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 462 at 513-514: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It [the role] ensures that an individual will not be surrendered for a trial 
  in a foreign jurisdiction unless, as previously mentioned, the requesting state 
  presents evidence that demonstrates on a prima facie basis that the individual 
  has committed acts in the foreign jurisdiction that would constitute criminal 
  conduct in Canada.</p>
<p>
  This led the extradition judge to conclude: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I confess that I am unable to understand how I can be required to ensure that 
  the requesting state presents a prima facie case that acts were committed in 
  its jurisdiction without considering &quot;where the acts charged took place&quot;.</p>
<p>
  [10] After stating that all of the cocaine dealings between Fonseca and the 
  respondent took place in the Toronto area, the extradition judge concluded: </p>
<p class="indent"> I am satisfied that there is a prima facie case made out that 
  [the respondent] conspired with [Fonseca] to traffic in cocaine and that they 
  conspired to possess cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.</p>
<p class="indent">However, there is not one shred of evidence that such activity 
  took place in the jurisdiction of the United States of America (the requesting 
  state).</p>
<p class="indent">Following Dynar, I dismiss the application of the United States 
  of America and order that John Kavartzis be discharged.</p>
<p>
  Analysis</p>
<p>
  (i) The respondent's discharge</p>
<p>
  [11] The respondent concedes that the extradition judge erred in discharging 
  him on the basis that there was no evidence that the conduct alleged against 
  him occurred within the jurisdiction of the United States. Although the extradition 
  judge was satisfied that there was a prima facie case that the respondent committed 
  the two offences set out in the authority to proceed, he was nevertheless of 
  the view that he could not commit the respondent unless there was evidence that 
  the offences occurred in the United States. In arriving at this conclusion, 
  he misunderstood Dynar and misinterpreted s. 29(1)(a) of the Act. </p>
<p> [12] The extradition process in Canada was reviewed by Arbour J. in United 
  States of America v. Kwok, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 532 at paras. 27-37 in the context 
  of the former Act. Her description applies equally to the process under the 
  present Act. She pointed out that extradition is primarily a function of the 
  executive branch of government and a product of international agreements between 
  states, in which the court plays an important but limited role. The role is 
  to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to order the committal for 
  surrender of the person whose extradition is sought. Where the court decides 
  that the person sought should be committed, it is for the Minister of Justice 
  to determine whether that person is to be surrendered to the requesting state, 
  known under the present Act as the extradition partner.</p>
<p>
  [13] Under the present Act, the extradition process is commenced by the Minister 
  of Justice by issuing an authority to proceed under s. 15 of the Act, which 
  forms the foundational document for an extradition hearing under s. 24. Where, 
  as in this case, the person is sought for prosecution, s. 29(1)(a) requires 
  that the extradition judge commit the person sought where &quot;there is evidence... 
  of conduct that, had it occurred in Canada, would justify committal for trial 
  in Canada on the offence set out in the authority to proceed&quot;. </p>
<p>
  [14] Applying this analysis to the circumstances of this appeal, the two offences 
  named in the authority to proceed are conspiracy to traffic in cocaine and conspiracy 
  to possess cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. As the extradition judge 
  found, the evidence of the conduct on which the United States based its request 
  for the respondent's extradition disclosed an international conspiracy in the 
  United States and Canada in which the respondent was implicated through his 
  cocaine transactions in Canada. Once the trial judge made this finding, by the 
  mandatory language of s. 29(1)(a) he was required to commit the respondent into 
  custody to await surrender to the United States in the exercise of the discretion 
  of the Minister of Justice. </p>
<p>
  [15] Sections 15 and 29 are central to the judicial phase of the extradition 
  process. Their effect was explained by Rosenberg J.A. on behalf of this court 
  in U.S.A. v. Yang (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 52 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 5: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The combined effect of ss. 15 and 29 is to implement the double criminality 
  requirement. The authority to proceed sets out the Canadian offence that is 
  equivalent to the offence allegedly committed in the extradition partner state. 
  The extradition judge is therefore not concerned with foreign law. He or she 
  merely determines whether there is evidence of conduct that would amount to 
  the Canadian offence described in the authority to proceed. The evidence must 
  be sufficient as would justify an accused's committal for trial if the offence 
  [for which his extradition is sought] were alleged to have been committed in 
  Canada [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [16] As Rosenberg J.A. stated in para. 47, the role of the extradition judge 
  is defined by s. 29(1). Primarily, that role is &quot;to ensure the identity 
  of the person sought and to protect that person from being surrendered for conduct 
  that [Canadian law] would not recognize as criminal&quot;. Rosenberg J.A. continued: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Thus, the judicial hearing acts as a modest screening device. It is structured 
  around the fundamental concept that the actual trial takes place in the requesting 
  state. Accordingly, the hearing is &quot;intended to be an expedited process, 
  designed to keep expenses to a minimum and ensure prompt compliance with Canada's 
  international obligations&quot;: Dynar at p. 514.</p>
<p>
  A helpful explanation of the extradition process under the new Act, including 
  the roles played in the process by the Minister of Justice and the extradition 
  judge, is to be found in the reasons for judgment of Dambrot J. in Drysdale, 
  supra, at pp. 146-147, 151-152 and 157.</p>
<p>
  [17] Section 29(1)(a), therefore, does not authorize the extradition judge to 
  consider foreign law or whether the extradition partner has jurisdiction over 
  the conduct for which extradition is sought. That the extradition judge is not 
  to be concerned about foreign law is reinforced by s. 33(3)(a) of the Act which 
  provides that the record of the case for extradition, which under s. 33(1)(a) 
  must include a document summarizing the evidence available to the extradition 
  partner for use in the prosecution, may not be admitted unless it is sufficient 
  under the law of the extradition partner to justify prosecution. In this appeal, 
  the record of the case was certified by a trial attorney with the United States 
  Department of Justice in the following terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In relation to that request [for extradition of the respondent] I... certify 
  that the evidence summarized or contained in the attached documents is available 
  for trial and is sufficient under the law of the United States to justify prosecution. 
  </p>
<p>
  [18] Thus, in discharging the respondent because there was no evidence that 
  the United States had jurisdiction over the &quot;activity&quot; that implicated 
  the respondent, the extradition judge misinterpreted s. 29(1)(a) of the Act. 
  He appears to have interpreted s. 29(1)(a) as requiring the United States to 
  establish that it has prosecutorial jurisdiction over the cocaine transactions 
  in which the respondent engaged in Toronto. As I have indicated, the extradition 
  judge's role is limited to determining whether there is evidence of conduct 
  that would amount to the Canadian offence described in the authority to proceed. 
  In this case, that conduct consists of evidence of Fonseca's international cocaine 
  trafficking conspiracy. The United States is seeking the respondent's extradition 
  so that he can be tried as a member of the conspiracy on the basis of his acts 
  in furtherance of the conspiracy that occurred in Toronto, and not for his purchases 
  of cocaine from Fonesca in Toronto as the extradition judge appeared to think. 
  In addition, s. 5 of the Act expressly provides that a requesting state need 
  not demonstrate its jurisdiction over the conduct for which extradition is requested. 
  </p>
<p>
  [19] As I have stated, although the extradition judge acknowledged that the 
  Supreme Court of Canada in L&eacute;pine held that the former Act did not require 
  the extradition judge to consider where the acts charged took place, or the 
  jurisdiction of the requesting state, he was of the view that L&eacute;pine 
  was somehow overridden in this regard by the Supreme Court's decision in Dynar. 
  It would appear that the decision of this court in United States of America 
  v. Commisso (2000), 47 O.R. (3) 257 (Ont. C.A.) at paras. 40-41, that held that 
  L&eacute;pine was not overridden by Dynar, was not brought to the attention 
  of the extradition judge. The views expressed in L&eacute;pine are now reinforced 
  by s. 5 of the Act. </p>
<p>
  [20] By way of summary, s. 15 informs s. 29(1)(a) and requires the extradition 
  judge to determine only whether the conduct disclosed by the extradition partner's 
  evidence on which it has based its request for extradition amounts to the Canadian 
  offence or offences specified in the authority to proceed. Before issuing an 
  authority to proceed the Minister of Justice must identify the Canadian offence 
  constituted by the alleged conduct. Under s. 29(1)(a), the extradition judge 
  need only assess the evidence against the offence described in the authority 
  to proceed. The status of the person sought is not an issue for the extradition 
  judge. This is an additional matter for the decision of the Minister before 
  he or she may issue an authority to proceed as s. 15 requires that the Minister 
  be satisfied that the extradition request meets the requirements of s. 3. Section 
  3 includes the determination that the request for extradition is &quot;for the 
  purpose of prosecuting... the person&quot; requested for extradition. </p>
<p>
  [21] Thus, the extradition judge erred in discharging the respondent. </p>
<p>
  (ii) Did the extradition judge, notwithstanding that he erred in interpreting 
  s. 29(1)(a) of the Act, reach the correct result?</p>
<p>
  [22] The respondent takes the position that even though the extradition judge 
  ordered his discharge on erroneous grounds, the judge nevertheless reached the 
  correct result for the following reasons: (1) the authority to proceed was lacking 
  in particulars of the two conspiracies that it set out; and (2) the &quot;mirror 
  image&quot; requirement of s. 29(1)(a) cannot be applied where the conduct relied 
  on for the extradition of the person sought occurred entirely in Canada. In 
  support of this position, the respondent relies on certain observations of Dambrot 
  J. in Drysdale, supra. The respondent did not advance this argument before the 
  extradition judge. For the reasons that follow, I would not give effect to this 
  argument. </p>
<p>
  [23] In Drysdale, an extradition hearing was held with respect to four individuals 
  whose extradition was sought under the present Act by the United States on narcotics 
  charges. The Minister of Justice issued an authority to proceed with regard 
  to each individual. In total, the authorities to proceed referenced twenty-one 
  Canadian offences of which eleven were drug related conspiracies. At the conclusion 
  of the hearing, Dambrot J. discharged Drysdale and two other individuals on 
  the ground that the evidence of their conduct did not meet the test in s. 29(1)(a). 
  However, he committed the fourth individual, Manningham, whose appeal from his 
  committal was heard by this court in December 17, 2003 and, at present, is under 
  consideration. </p>
<p>
  [24] As authority for the two grounds that the respondent advances in support 
  of his contention that the extradition judge reached the correct result, counsel 
  for the respondent relies on two lengthy passages from Dambrot J.'s reasons 
  for judgment. In the first passage, at pp. 158-159, Dambrot J. was concerned 
  with the Minister's failure to provide particulars of the numerous conspiracies 
  contained in the authorities to proceed. However, his concern was alleviated 
  by the specification by the requesting state of the offences that he was required 
  to consider. In the second passage, at pp. 159-161, he discussed his difficulty 
  in undertaking a s. 29(1)(a) analysis where the evidence of the &quot;acts&quot; 
  or conduct relied on by the extradition partner for the extradition of the person 
  sought took place entirely in Canada. He was troubled by the fact that Drysdale 
  and other Canadian &quot;members&quot; of the alleged U.S. drug conspiracy had 
  been convicted of Canadian offences on the basis of their Canadian conduct, 
  which also formed part of the conduct relied on by the United States for their 
  extradition. </p>
<p>
  [25] As the appellant submits, the discussion of Dambrot J. in Drysdale relied 
  on by the respondent played no part in his decision and constitutes obiter dicta. 
  In this case, the authority to proceed complies with s. 15(3)(c) of the Act, 
  which does not require the Minister of Justice to provide particulars of the 
  offences that under Canadian law correspond to the alleged conduct of the person 
  sought. The evidence of the international cocaine conspiracy relied on by the 
  United States for its request to extradite the respondent implicated him as 
  a member of the conspiracy by virtue of his conduct in furtherance of the conspiracy. 
  Moreover, the extradition judge found that this evidence was sufficient to support 
  the two conspiracies set out in the authority to proceed. As I have stated, 
  under s. 29(1)(a) of the Act this constitutes the limited role of the judge 
  in an extradition hearing. As for the second ground relied on by the respondent, 
  the appellant further submits, as I have explained, that it is not within the 
  extradition judge's role to be concerned with the place where the alleged conduct 
  of the person sought occurred, or the laws of that place. The status of the 
  person sought is an issue for the Minister of Justice and not for the extradition 
  judge. </p>
<p>
  [26] Therefore, I am unable to agree with the respondent that the extradition 
  judge reached the correct result notwithstanding that he erred in interpreting 
  s. 29(1)(a) of the Act.</p>
<p>
  Result</p>
<p>
  [27] For the foregoing reasons, the extradition judge erred in his interpretation 
  of s. 29(1)(a) of the Act. The respondent's argument does not convince me that 
  the extradition judge nevertheless came to the right result. Therefore, I would 
  allow the appeal and set aside the respondent's discharge. As a prima facie 
  case was made out against the respondent on the offences described in the authority 
  to proceed, this is an appropriate case in which to order the committal of the 
  respondent under s. 55(2) of the Act. </p>
<p>
  [28] In the result, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the extradition 
  judge discharging the respondent and substitute an order for his committal. 
  Should the appellant require the assistance of the court in carrying out this 
  order, it may bring the appropriate application.</p>
