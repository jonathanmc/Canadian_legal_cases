<p>On appeal from a judgment of Justice Johanne N. Morissette of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated October 2, 2002.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
  FELDMAN J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] This appeal concerns a disputed petition for a receiving order. For the 
  following reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the receiving order, 
  allow the respondent to amend the petition and send the matter back to the bankruptcy 
  judge. </p>
<p>
  FACTS AND FINDINGS</p>
<p>
  [2] The petitioning creditor is the estate of Stephen Fancsy. Before he died, 
  Mr. Fancsy advanced $900,000 to the debtor, Peter Valente, evidenced by a promissory 
  note dated September 12, 1997. The note provided that interest would be at a 
  rate of ten per cent and that the full amount was payable on September 15, 1998. 
  The parties also entered into a share pledge agreement to secure the debt. The 
  agreement provided that it was the sole recourse of the creditor in the event 
  of default on the promissory note. The debtor held the shares in trust for his 
  son, and represented in the share pledge agreement that he had obtained the 
  authorization of the beneficial owner of the shares to pledge them pursuant 
  to the agreement.</p>
<p>
  [3] The debtor never paid any monies under the note. The creditor's estate obtained 
  summary judgment on the note on May 10, 2000, in the amount of $1,139,178.07 
  plus costs. No amount was ever paid on the judgment. The creditor conducted 
  a judgment debtor examination on November 21, 2000, at which the debtor acknowledged 
  that at that date there was another outstanding judgment against him for $800,000.</p>
<p>
  [4] The petition for a receiving order relied on the one debt, the judgment 
  on the promissory note, and recited that the creditor held no security on the 
  debtor's property for payment on the debt. In his notice disputing the petition, 
  the debtor denied that he had failed to meet his liabilities generally as they 
  became due, acknowledged the petitioner's debt and that it had not been paid, 
  but stated that following the judgment representatives of the creditor estate 
  had agreed to take steps to realize on the pledged shares but had not attempted 
  to do so.</p>
<p>
  [5] The two issues for the bankruptcy judge were: (1) whether the one judgment 
  debt over $1000 constituted the act of bankruptcy defined in s. 42(1)(j) of 
  the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, ceasing to meet liabilities 
  generally as they become due; and (2) whether the creditor held security for 
  the debt which it did not disclose in the petition.</p>
<p>
  [6] The bankruptcy judge granted the petition. She held: (1) based on this court's 
  decision in Platt v. Malmstrom (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 502, the judgment automatically 
  qualified as a special circumstance required for a single debt to constitute 
  the act of bankruptcy under s. 42(1)(j); and (2) because the creditor had obtained 
  judgment on the promissory note in the face of the provision in the share pledge 
  agreement that made it the sole recourse for default under the note, the judgment 
  on the note must be taken as a denial of the validity or effectiveness of the 
  share pledge agreement and was res judicata on that issue. Consequently, the 
  petitioning creditor was not a secured creditor and the affidavit to that effect 
  did not constitute non-disclosure.</p>
<p>
  ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
  (1) Did the bankruptcy judge err in holding that the single debt owed to the 
  petitioning creditor qualified under s. 42(1)(j) of the B.I.A. as "ceas[ing] 
  to meet &#133; liabilities generally as they become due"?</p>
<p>
  (2) Did the bankruptcy judge err in finding that the petitioning creditor was 
  not a secured creditor and therefore not obliged to value its security in the 
  petition for the receiving order?</p>
<p>
  ANALYSIS</p>
<p> Issue One</p>
<p>
  [7] The relevant sections of the B.I.A. are 43(1) and 42(1)(j). Section 43(1) 
  sets out when a creditor may petition a debtor into bankruptcy. The section 
  provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> 43(1) Subject to this section, one or more creditors may file 
  in court a petition for a receiving order against a debtor if, and if it is 
  alleged in the petition that,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the debt or debts owing to the petitioning creditor or creditors 
  amount to one thousand dollars; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the debtor has committed an act of bankruptcy within six 
  months next preceding the filing of the petition.</p>
<p>
  Section 42(1)(j) provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A debtor commits an act of bankruptcy&#133;if he ceases to meet his liabilities 
  generally as they become due.</p>
<p>
  [8] It is now well-settled in the case law that the failure to pay a single 
  creditor can constitute an act of bankruptcy under s. 42(1)(j) when there are 
  special circumstances, which have been recognized in three categories: (a) where 
  repeated demands for payment have been made within the six-month period; (b) 
  where the debt is significantly large and there is fraud or suspicious circumstances 
  in the way the debtor has handled its assets which require that the processes 
  of the B.I.A. be set in motion; and (c) prior to the filing of the petition, 
  the debtor has admitted its inability to pay creditors generally without identifying 
  the creditors: Re Holmes (1976), 9 O.R. (2d) 240 (Sup. Ct.); see also Houlden 
  and Morawetz, The 2004 Annotated Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Toronto: Carswell, 
  2003) at 147 D&sect;10(3).</p>
<p>
  [9] The bankruptcy judge held that there was no evidence establishing criteria 
  (b) or (c). In this case, the debt has been pursued to judgment. The petitioning 
  creditor does not state that repeated demands were made for payment of the judgment 
  debt. Rather, the petitioning creditor relied on the case of Platt, supra, for 
  the proposition that a judgment constitutes a continuing demand for payment 
  and the failure to satisfy the judgment is a continuing refusal by the judgment 
  debtor. The bankruptcy judge applied Platt and found that the one judgment satisfied 
  the first test from Holmes and constituted an act of bankruptcy under s. 42(1)(j).</p>
<p>
  [10] In Platt the issue before the court was whether the act of bankruptcy had 
  occurred within the six months prior to the petition. The concern in Platt was 
  that there was no demand within the six months prior to the petition. The court 
  noted that the theory behind the six-month limit is to ensure that a bankruptcy 
  petitioner does not rely on stale-dated debts; however, it has been accepted 
  that continued demands for payment following the debt and within the six-month 
  period can have the effect of reviving the original debt, thus making the debt 
  once again current: Re Harrap of Milton Inc. (1979), 22 O.R. (2d) 239 (Ont. 
  S.C.). The court also referred to a line of cases that has recognized that no 
  demand is necessary within the six months if there is evidence of a continuing 
  default. See, e.g. Re Aarvi Construction Co. Ltd. (1978), 29 C.B.R. (N.S.) 265 
  (Ont. S.C.). The court held that a judgment debt is a continuing demand for 
  payment and in that context, is able to satisfy the statutory time requirement, 
  that is, it can be considered as one of the debts that forms part of an act 
  of bankruptcy within the six-month period prior to the petition. The court stated 
  at para. 18: "It is inappropriate to require a creditor who has proceeded 
  properly through legal channels and become a judgment creditor to make frequent 
  demands for payment to the judgment debtor, only for the purpose of ensuring 
  that the statutory time limitations are complied with" (emphasis added).</p>
<p>
  [11] The petition in Platt relied on six debts, four of which were taken to 
  judgment. Each of the debts predated the petition by more than six months. The 
  court was satisfied based on the number of debts and the continuing failure 
  to pay them, that an act of bankruptcy had been committed within the six-month 
  limit. </p>
<p>
  [12] However, that may not be the case where, for example, a single creditor 
  obtains a judgment and either shortly thereafter petitions the debtor into bankruptcy 
  based on the judgment and the implicit demands, or does nothing for an extended 
  period, then petitions on the basis that the judgment constitutes a continuing 
  demand. In neither case would the judgment be evidence of failure to meet obligations 
  generally, as contemplated by the special circumstances doctrine.</p>
<p>
  [13] Henry J. explained the philosophy behind allowing a single debt to be sufficient 
  evidence of failing to meet liabilities generally as they become due in Re Holmes, 
  supra, at 243: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Because this Court has in some of the recent decisions referred to, such as 
  Dixie Market [(Nurseries) Ltd. (1971), 14 C.B.R. (N.S.) 281 (Ont. S.C.)], Polyco 
  [Distributors Ltd. (1971), 14 C.B.R. (N.S.) 285 (Ont. S.C.)] and King Petroleum 
  [Ltd., (1973), 2 O.R. (2d) 192 (Ont. S.C.)], made a receiving order on proof 
  of failure to meet a liability to a single creditor, it is not to be taken to 
  have established a new principle that a petitioning creditor need only prove 
  default with respect to the debt owing to him. Those decisions in my judgment 
  do not lay down such a principle; they are as I see it, merely the application 
  to particular facts of the general rule (exemplified by the decision in Re Elkind, 
  [(1966), 9 C.B.R. (N.S.) 274 (Ont. S.C.)]), that when relying on an act of bankruptcy 
  described in s. 24(1) (j) the petitioning creditor must strictly establish that, 
  in the words of the statute, the debtor "ceases to meet his liabilities 
  generally as they become due"; in all of them the Court was influenced 
  either by the existence of other creditors, or of one of the special circumstances 
  I have set out above. In the non-exceptional case, as in the case at bar, that 
  situation cannot be ordinarily proved by having regard to the experience of 
  one creditor only, even though he may be a major creditor. Resort to the statutory 
  machinery of the Bankruptcy Act, rather than to the remedies to enforce a debt 
  or claim in the ordinary Courts, is intended by Parliament to be for the benefit 
  of the creditors of a debtor as a class, and the act of bankruptcy described 
  in s. 24(1)(j) is in my judgment, an act that singles out the conduct of the 
  debtor in relation to the class, rather than to the individual (as is the case 
  under s. 24(1)(e)). It is for this reason that the Court must be satisfied that 
  there is sufficient evidence from which an inference of fact can fairly be drawn 
  that creditors generally are not being paid. This requires as a minimum some 
  evidence that liabilities other than those incurred towards the petitioning 
  creditor, have ceased to be met. The Court ought not to be asked to draw inferences 
  with respect to the class on the basis of one creditor's experience where evidence 
  of the debtor's conduct towards other members of the class could, with reasonable 
  diligence, be discovered and produced. The Court's intuition is no substitute 
  for the diligence of the petitioning creditor.</p>
<p>
  [14] The question for this court is whether the concept that a judgment constitutes 
  a continuing demand will render every debt that has been pursued to judgment 
  a special circumstance making that one debt evidence of an act of bankruptcy. 
  </p>
<p>
  [15] Based on Platt, once a debt has been pursued to judgment, because that 
  judgment constitutes a continuing demand for payment, it can form the basis 
  for a finding that it constitutes an act of bankruptcy based on special circumstances. 
  However, one judgment debt will not necessarily constitute special circumstances 
  in every case. Ultimately the issue for the bankruptcy court on a petition for 
  a receiving order is whether the creditor has proved that the debtor committed 
  the act of bankruptcy alleged in the petition. Sections 43(6) and (7) provide: </p>
<p class="indent"> 43(6) At the hearing of the petition, the court shall require 
  proof of the facts alleged in the petition and of the service of the petition, 
  and, if satisfied with the proof, may make a receiving order.</p>
<p class="indent">(7) Where the court is not satisfied with the proof of the facts 
  alleged in the petition or of the service of the petition, or is satisfied by 
  the debtor that he is able to pay his debts, or that for other sufficient cause 
  no order ought to be made, it shall dismiss the petition.</p>
<p> [16] Before the court can be satisfied that the failure to pay one judgment 
  debt is tantamount to failing to meet liabilities generally as they become due, 
  the court must examine and consider all of the circumstances including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the size of the judgment - a small unpaid judgment is less likely to indicate 
    an act of bankruptcy than a very large one;</li>
  <li>how long the judgment has been outstanding - there may be reasons why a 
    recently obtained judgment has not been paid as yet, including a potential 
    appeal, the need to arrange for the marshalling of funds, the intent to make 
    arrangements for payment over time or in the case of a default judgment, knowledge 
    of the judgment;</li>
  <li>if a judgment has been outstanding for a long time, it may be that the debtor 
    believes that the creditor is willing to wait for payment, and is paying his 
    or her other debts as they fall due;</li>
  <li>whether the judgment creditor has conducted a judgment debtor examination 
    and the results of that examination - if the judgment creditor can collect 
    without invoking the mechanism of the bankruptcy process, a petition ought 
    not to be granted;</li>
  <li>what steps the judgment creditor has taken to determine whether the debtor 
    has other creditors and the results of those inquiries.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [17] In this case, the bankruptcy court judge appeared to conclude that the 
  one judgment automatically constituted special circumstances and an act of bankruptcy, 
  without considering whether, in all of the circumstances, the petitioning creditor 
  had proved that the debtor was not meeting his liabilities generally as they 
  fell due.</p>
<p>
  [18] The creditor had conducted a judgment debtor examination, the main thrust 
  of which appeared to have been directed to the issue of the pledged shares. 
  The record does not disclose whether other assets were pursued or whether the 
  sheriff was sent to attempt to levy execution. (A report that there are no assets 
  upon which to levy, itself constitutes an act of bankruptcy under s. 42(1)(e)).</p>
<p>
  [19] In this case, the only other potentially relevant evidence is the existence 
  of another large judgment debt of $800,000 in favour of the Canadian Imperial 
  Bank of Commerce which was outstanding at the date of Mr. Valente's judgment 
  debtor examination, November 2000, more than six months before the petition. 
  The petition did not rely on this debt. Nor did the bankruptcy judge consider 
  this evidence an acknowledgement by the debtor that he was failing to meet his 
  liabilities generally as they became due. The petitioning creditor provided 
  no proof that that judgment remained outstanding at the time of the petition. 
  The debtor filed an unsworn Notice of Cause Against the Petition which states 
  that he is able to meet his obligations as they come due and denies committing 
  an act of bankruptcy. Although the debtor could have provided proof that he 
  had paid the Bank of Commerce debt, the onus is on the petitioning creditor 
  to prove the act of bankruptcy: Re Roy (1982), 44 C.B.R. 86 (Ont. S.C.). The 
  creditor could have called the bank as a witness on the petition or filed an 
  execution certificate showing the continued existence of the debt.</p>
<p>
  [20] As the bankruptcy judge treated the judgment as automatically constituting 
  an act of bankruptcy without considering the factors identified at para. 16 
  of these reasons, I would set aside the receiving order, but remit the matter 
  to the bankruptcy judge for further consideration.</p>
<p>
  Issue 2</p>
<p>
  [21] It appears from the record that it is not disputed that the creditor does 
  retain the security of the pledged shares, whether or not the terms of the share 
  pledge agreement were ignored in obtaining judgment on the note. It is therefore 
  unnecessary to comment on the issue of res judicata referenced by the bankruptcy 
  judge.</p>
<p>
  [22] In those circumstances, the creditor may either value the pledged shares 
  for the purpose of the petition, deducting that value from the debt, or disclaim 
  the pledged shares in the context of the bankruptcy: s. 43(2). Once that is 
  done, the bankruptcy court will be in a position to assess whether the single 
  judgment at issue constitutes an act of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [23] Both at trial and on this appeal the creditor requested as alternative 
  relief that it be allowed to amend the petition to value or disclaim the security 
  under s. 43(2). In my view, in the circumstances it is appropriate that the 
  creditor be allowed to amend its petition as advised (including in respect of 
  other debts, if they exist) and the matter be referred back to the bankruptcy 
  court in Windsor to consider the amended petition and any response by the debtor.</p>
<p>
  [24] The costs of the appeal are fixed at $3,000 inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements 
  and shall be payable in the cause of the petition.</p>
