<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of assault and assault carrying a weapon. The 
  complainant alleged that the assault occurred in the course of being extorted 
  for a drug debt, but the appellant was acquitted on three counts related to 
  the extortion. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant advances two grounds of appeal against his convictions. First, 
  he submits that the verdicts were inconsistent. Second, he submits that the 
  trial judge misapprehended the defence witness, Pelusso's evidence. We do not 
  agree with either submission.</p>
<p>
  [3] On the first ground, the verdicts are not violently at odds. The trial judge 
  had confirmatory evidence of the assault and a detailed description of the gun. 
  He was therefore satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was 
  beaten up and that the appellant was carrying a weapon. Conversely, the complainant's 
  evidence that he had been accused of stealing from the co-accused's mother arguably 
  gave rise to reasonable doubt on the extortion charges. Although these charges 
  were not particularized in the information, on the Crown's theory they were 
  based on a drug debt. The trial judge was therefore entitled to have a reasonable 
  doubt on these charges. </p>
<p>
  [4] On the second ground, the trial judge obviously gave little or no weight 
  to Mr. Pelusso's evidence and we see no error in his doing so. Mr. Pelusso testified 
  that he did not see any injuries on the complainant. But the complainant called 
  the police the night he was injured and had a bruised eye and a fat lip. Thus, 
  either Mr. Pelusso did not see him that night, was talking about a different 
  night altogether, or was not being truthful. Although the trial judge might 
  have been more explicit in saying that Mr. Pelusso's evidence did not give rise 
  to a reasonable doubt, we are not persuaded that he misapprehended his evidence.</p>
<p>
  [5] Accordingly, the appeal against the convictions is dismissed. </p>
