<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was convicted of dangerous driving causing death and dangerous 
  driving causing bodily harm. The charges arose out of a car accident which occurred 
  on a city street in Toronto. The appellant was driving at an excessive speed 
  on a wet road and lost control of his vehicle. The appellant appeals his conviction 
  and the sentence of two years less a day imposed by the trial judge.</p>
<p>[2] The appellant advances two grounds of appeal on the conviction appeal. 
  He contends that the trial judge erred in holding that the appellant&#146;s 
  right under s. 11(b) of the Charter had not been infringed. The appellant also 
  argues that the trial erred in his interpretation of s. 577 of the Criminal 
  Code and should have found that the Attorney General had no power to consent 
  to the preferring of the indictment. The appellant had been committed for trial 
  but, that committal had been quashed by a judge of the Superior Court. The Attorney 
  General then preferred an indictment under s. 577(a).</p>
<p>[3] The trial judge addressed the two arguments advanced on appeal in careful 
  and detailed reasons. We agree with those reasons and do not propose to add 
  anything to his analysis of the s. 11(b) claim. For the reasons set out by the 
  trial judge we reject that claim.</p>
<p>[4] With respect to the interpretation of s. 577(a) of the Criminal Code as 
  it read at the time of the trial, like the trial judge, we agree with the interpretation 
  of that section found in R. v. Charlie (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 513 (B.C. C.A.) 
  and R. v. Ewen (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 277 (Sask. C.A.). In those cases, the 
  courts held that where a committal for trial was quashed, it could not be said 
  that a preliminary inquiry had been held for the purpose of s. 577(a) of the 
  Criminal Code. The Attorney General or his Deputy were, therefore, authorized 
  to consent to the preferment of the indictment. </p>
<p>[5] Section 577 of the Criminal Code limits the power of the prosecutor to 
  prefer an indictment set out in s. 574. We read s. 577 as providing that where 
  there has been no judicial determination that there is a prima facie case against 
  an accused, an indictment can be preferred against the accused only where the 
  Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General personally consents to the preferment 
  of the indictment. This limitation is intended to give the accused added protection 
  from unwarranted prosecution absent a judicial determination that a trial is 
  justified. The interpretation of s. 577 in R. v. Charlie, supra, is consistent 
  with the purpose of s. 577. We agree with the trial judge that the Attorney 
  General had the authority to prefer this indictment under s. 577(a). </p>
<p>[6] As to sentence, the trial judge erred the principle in holding that a conditional 
  sentence would not be appropriate because he could not be assured that there 
  was a sufficient structure that would ensure obedience to the conditions. In 
  fairness, the trial judge did not have the benefit of this court&#146;s decision 
  in R. v. Nault (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 388. We are not convinced that this error 
  did not infect the trial judge&#146;s findings respecting the need for deterrence 
  and denunciation. It therefore falls to this court to determine the appropriate 
  sentence.</p>
<p>[7] We are not persuaded that this is the proper case for a conditional sentence 
  given the serious conduct that led to the offence. In our view, given the appellant&#146;s 
  good character, minimal driving record, the fact that alcohol played no role 
  in the accident and the relatively brief nature of the bad driving, an appropriate 
  sentence would be fifteen months imprisonment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[8] Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed 
  and the sentence is reduced to fifteen months imprisonment. The driving prohibition 
  as imposed by the trial judge will stand. Given the time the appellant has been 
  on bail pending appeal, we see no need for probation and that part of the sentence 
  will be set aside.</p>
