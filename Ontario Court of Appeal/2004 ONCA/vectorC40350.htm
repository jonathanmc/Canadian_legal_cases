<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant's former counsel indicated that he had to withdraw from the 
  case. He attended before the motions judge to request an adjournment. He indicated 
  that he believed Mr. Markin was prepared to be counsel of record. The motions 
  judge agreed to adjourn the motion until 3:00 p.m. to permit Mr. Markin to file 
  a Notice of Change of Solicitor and arrange dates for cross-examination. The 
  motions judge was told by former counsel that he was unable to contact Mr. Markin 
  because he was in another court. The motions judge therefore refused the adjournment 
  and dismissed the counter-application and granted the application. </p>
<p>
  [2] In our view, this was not a reasonable exercise of discretion. The motions 
  judge knew Mr. Markin was in court and that former counsel had not been able 
  to contact him. There is no basis for the suggestion that former counsel's decision 
  to remove himself from the record was itself a delaying tactic. </p>
<p>
  [3] The appellate courts are of course very reluctant to interfere with the 
  decisions of motions judges with respect to adjournments. However, the motions 
  judge should have given the appellant a reasonable time to make the necessary 
  arrangements to confirm that new counsel would act for it. </p>
<p>
  [4] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of Kruzick J. is set aside.</p>

  Abella J.A. (dissenting)</p>
<p>
  [5] The issues in this appeal turn on the entire history of this application, 
  not merely the events of June 19, 2003 before Kruzick J. </p>
<p>
  [6] Based on that history, I see no error in the discretion exercised by the 
  motions judge. The record before him and O'Connor J. reflects a blatant pattern 
  of delay and disregard for a series of judicial orders, orders which had attempted 
  to accommodate the many previous requests by the appellant for special consideration. 
  The situation on June 19, 2003 was one of the appellant's own making, and what 
  it seeks is this court's further indulgence based on its own non-compliance 
  with the indulgences granted below. </p>
<p>
  [7] I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
