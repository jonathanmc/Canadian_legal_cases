<p>On appeal from the conviction entered on October 1, 2001 by Justice Ian V.B. 
  Nordheimer of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, and from the 
  sentence imposed by Justice Nordheimer on November 7, 2001.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT:</p>
<p>
  [1] Following a joint trial before a judge and jury, the appellant Bao Ngoc 
  Vu and his co?defendant Giang Long Hoang were convicted of trafficking in heroin. 
  Vu appeals his conviction, alleging that the trial judge's charge to the jury 
  erroneously conflated his defence with that of his co-defendant, Giang Long 
  Hoang. </p>
<p>
  [2] The facts can be briefly stated as follows. On April 2, 1998, the police 
  arrested Quy Dao for selling heroin to an undercover officer. Up until that 
  date, Dao had sold heroin to an undercover officer on three prior occasions. 
  On April 2, the police observed Dao enter a restaurant with the co?accused Hoang. 
  Dao remained at the front while Hoang walked to the back of the restaurant and 
  joined the appellant Vu. According to the police, the appellant passed a small, 
  white, bag-like object across the table to Hoang who picked it up and took it 
  to Dao. Dao left the restaurant and went to the undercover officer's van and 
  gave him a substance that turned out to be heroin. Dao was thereupon arrested 
  as well as Vu and Hoang. The appellant was found in possession of scales upon 
  his arrest. </p>
<p>
  [3] At trial, the appellant's primary defence was that the officer could not 
  have observed him passing a bag to Hoang because the officer was too far away 
  and his view would have been obstructed. The appellant also relied on inconsistencies 
  in the Crown witnesses' testimony and the failure to produce certain items of 
  evidence in support of his contention that the Crown had failed to prove that 
  he was the source of the heroin. Alternatively, counsel for the appellant suggested 
  to the jury that Hoang alone could have been the source of the heroin. </p>
<p>
  [4] Hoang joined the appellant in his primary defence that the officer, because 
  of his location, could not have observed the exchange of drugs inside the restaurant 
  as contended. Counsel for Hoang also relied on certain weaknesses in the Crown's 
  case in support of his defence. Alternatively, counsel for Hoang suggested to 
  the jury that, if they believed that Vu passed a package to Hoang, this was 
  done in such a nonchalant manner that they should be left with a doubt as to 
  Hoang's knowledge of the contents of that package. </p>
<p>
  [5] The only issue on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in the jury charge 
  in the manner that he presented Vu's theory of the case. The appellant contends 
  that the co-defendants led antagonistic defences at trial, with each attempting 
  to incriminate the other. He argues that, in the circumstances, the trial judge 
  did not adequately distinguish the positions of the two defendants so as to 
  make it clear that the jury could find one accused guilty but not the other. 
  This argument was also made at trial. At the conclusion of the trial judge's 
  initial charge to the jury, counsel for each co-defendant requested that the 
  judge clarify his charge on this point. All parties agreed on what additional 
  instructions should be given and the jury was instructed accordingly. No further 
  objection was made to the recharge. The appellant now contends that these additional 
  instructions were inadequate. </p>
<p>
  [6] We are not persuaded by the appellant's position before this court. In our 
  view, the respective defences advanced by the two co-defendants were not at 
  odds with each other but, rather, in their main thrust, joint. In his main charge, 
  the trial judge repeatedly instructed the jury on the need to consider each 
  accused separately. Where he referred to both defence theories jointly, it was 
  in respect to those aspects of the defence that had been put forth in a joint 
  fashion by both defendants. While his charge may have put the alternative position 
  of the defence more clearly, this was the subject-matter of the objection to 
  the charge and the matter was clarified in the recharge in a form agreed upon 
  by counsel. When viewed in context, it is our view that the jury could not have 
  failed to appreciate the appellant's defence. This case was not complex and 
  the defence was a simple one. For these reasons, the appeal against conviction 
  is dismissed. </p>
<p>
  [7] The appellant also appealed against sentence. However, he made no submissions 
  in his factum. The application for leave to appeal the sentence is dismissed.</p>
