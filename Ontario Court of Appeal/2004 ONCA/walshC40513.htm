<p>On appeal from the order of Justice Lorna-Lee Snowie of the Superior Court 
  of Justice dated February 26, 2003.</p>
<p>
  LASKIN J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. Introduction</p>
<p> [1] This appeal raises an important question about retroactive child support 
  orders.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> </p>
<p>
  [2] In September 1997, after an eleven and a half year marriage, Michael Walsh 
  and Joanne Walsh divorced. A term of their divorce judgment ordered Mr. Walsh 
  to pay support for the parties' two children based on an imputed annual income 
  of $175,000 and calculated in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, 
  S.O.R./97-175. Mr. Walsh complied with this order.</p>
<p>
  [3] In the spring of 2002 Mrs. Walsh asked for copies of Mr. Walsh's income 
  tax returns for the previous four years. On receiving them she learned that 
  since 1997 her former husband's annual income had increased substantially. She 
  immediately sought a variation in child support and brought a motion for an 
  interim increase. Mr. Walsh consented to an increase beginning in the summer 
  of 2002. However, on the return of the interim motion, Snowie J. "recalculated" 
  the child support payable under the Guidelines for the years 1998 to 2001, based 
  on Mr. Walsh's actual income for those years. She ordered him to pay the "shortfall", 
  amounting to $42,917.88. </p>
<p>
  [4] Mr. Walsh appeals this order. The principal issue on the appeal is whether 
  the motions judge erred in ordering a retroactive increase in child support 
  without finding a change in circumstances and without finding that a retroactive 
  increase was required to meet the children's needs. This is a pure question 
  of law on which no deference is owed to the motions judge. The appropriate standard 
  of review is correctness. </p>
<p>
  [5] A secondary issue on the appeal is whether the motions judge erred in making 
  the order on an interim basis without finding an urgent, or at least pressing, 
  need for the increase. </p>
<p>
  [6] For the reasons that follow I conclude that the motions judge did err in 
  law in ordering the retroactive increase in child support. </p>
<p>
  B. Background</p>
<p>
  (i) Relevant facts</p>
<p>
  [7] Mr. and Mrs. Walsh were married in March 1986. They adopted two children, 
  who were aged ten and nine at the time of the hearing before the motions judge. 
  The parties separated in 1995. </p>
<p>
  [8] Mrs. Walsh had been employed in the financial services sector, but left 
  the workforce in 1992 to care for the children. When the parties divorced Mr. 
  Walsh was employed as head of business development at an investment counselling 
  firm. </p>
<p>
  [9] On September 23, 1997, after a long trial, Clarke J. granted the parties 
  joint custody of the children, though they were to live primarily with Mrs. 
  Walsh. He ordered Mr. Walsh to pay spousal support of $2,800 per month, but 
  also found that within four to six months Mrs. Walsh could get a job in her 
  field in the Toronto/Oakville area earning between $60,000 and $100,000 annually. 
  Of particular relevance to this appeal, Clarke J. ordered Mr. Walsh to pay child 
  support of $2,021 per month, which was the Guidelines figure that corresponded 
  to his annual income of $175,000. Mr. Walsh paid the support ordered by the 
  trial judge. The divorce judgment did not require Mr. Walsh to disclose his 
  annual income to Mrs. Walsh. </p>
<p>
  [10] In March 2002 Mrs. Walsh requested copies of Mr. Walsh's income tax returns 
  since 1997. Mr. Walsh complied with the request. By then he was vice president 
  of institutional investments at a division of Manulife Financial. His income 
  had substantially exceeded $175,000 in each of the intervening years, in 2001 
  dramatically so. His returns reflected the following annual income: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1998 - $223,079.12</p>
<p class="indent">1999 - $228,940.34</p>
<p class="indent">2000 - $214,916.45</p>
<p class="indent">2001 - $376,957.74</p>
<p>
  He had not voluntarily disclosed these increases to his former wife.</p>
<p>
  (ii) The motion</p>
<p>
  [11] In April 2002 Mrs. Walsh brought a motion to vary child support. Beginning 
  in July 2002 Mr. Walsh consented to several orders increasing the support he 
  was paying. By February 2003 he was paying $3,071 per month for the two children.</p>
<p>
  [12] However, in January 2003 Mrs. Walsh amended her notice of motion to ask 
  for an increase in child support calculated in accordance with the Guidelines, 
  retroactive to 1998, and for increased spousal support. The motion came on before 
  Snowie J. on an interim basis on February 26, 2003. Mr. Walsh sought an adjournment 
  to cross-examine Mrs. Walsh on her affidavit. The motions judge adjourned most 
  of the motion but she refused to adjourn the part requesting the retroactive 
  increase in child support. Instead, using the reported income on Mr. Walsh's 
  tax returns, she "recalculated" child support under the Guidelines 
  for the years 1998 to 2001, which yielded the following "shortfall" 
  in the amounts Mr. Walsh had paid: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1998 - $6,000.24</p>
<p class="indent">1999 - $6,731.76</p>
<p class="indent">2000 - $4,981.56</p>
<p class="indent">2001 - $25,204.32</p>
<p class="indent">Total shortfall in child support payments: $42,917.88</p>
<p>
  She ordered him to pay this total amount together with $3,000 in costs. She 
  also ordered that child support for 2002 be recalculated "when the appropriate 
  documents have been exchanged". </p>
<p>
  [13] The motions judge commented that she was not being asked to make a variation 
  order based on a material change. The crux of her reasoning is found in para. 
  13 of her endorsement: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I find that inherent in the Federal Child Support Guidelines is the discretion 
  of this Court to, from time to time, recalculate in accordance with the Guidelines, 
  the quantum of child support payable on the basis of updated income information 
  from the payor pursuant to s. 25.</p>
<p>
  [14] Mr. Walsh sought and obtained leave to appeal the motion judge's decision 
  to the Divisional Court. The Divisional Court, however, correctly decided that 
  the order under appeal was a final order involving over $25,000 and that, therefore, 
  the appeal lay to this court. </p>
<p>
  C. Discussion</p>
<p>
  [15] Under s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act, R.S.O. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), a court 
  may vary a court order for child support. Before doing so, however, it must 
  find a "change of circumstances" as defined in the Guidelines. </p>
<p>
  [16] Typically, any increase in child support takes effect from the date of 
  the application to vary or from the date of demand for a variation. See for 
  example Evans v. Gravely (2000), 14 R.F.L. (5th) 74 (Ont. S.C.) at para. 18. 
  A court may make its order retroactive to an earlier date, but to do so the 
  established jurisprudence of this court requires evidence of need during the 
  relevant period. Gillese J.A. recently affirmed this point in Drygala v. Pauli 
  (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 711 at para. 53: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The purpose of child support is to assist the custodial parent in meeting the 
  day-to-day expenses of raising children. A party seeking retroactive child support 
  must provide evidence that the child suffered from a lack of financial support 
  during the period in question. Ability to pay, as well as need, must be considered 
  by the trial judge in the exercise of his or her discretion.</p>
<p>
  See also Brett v. Brett (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 61 (C.A.). Retroactive support 
  is tied to need in part to ensure that a retroactive payment does not amount 
  to a wealth transfer to the payee disguised as child support. Need is especially 
  relevant when a payor's income exceeds $150,000 because under s. 4 of the Guidelines 
  the court has discretion on how much child support to order. </p>
<p>
  [17] In rare cases, a court may order an increase in child support on an interim 
  motion but only when the need for an increase is urgent or pressing. See Vipond 
  v. Vipond (1990), 72 O.R. (2d) 82 (Ont. S.C.).</p>
<p>
  [18] Here, the motions judge did not find a "change of circumstances" 
  - indeed she said that she was not being asked to do so. She did not find that 
  the needs of the children required a retroactive increase. And she did not find 
  that their needs were pressing. Yet the motions judge ordered an increase in 
  child support retroactive to four years before Mrs. Walsh began her application 
  to vary, and she did so on an interim motion. The motions judge justified her 
  order on a single ground: the Child Support Guidelines gave her "inherent 
  discretion" to "recalculate" the amount of child support from 
  time to time. She exercised this "inherent discretion" based on the 
  increase in Mr. Walsh's income and his failure to disclose the increase.</p>
<p>
  [19] Thus, the overriding question on this appeal is whether the Guidelines 
  regime overrides or modifies the statutory requirement in s. 17 of the Divorce 
  Act for variation in child support and the established case law of this court 
  for making a variation order retroactive. In my view, it does not.</p>
<p>
  [20] I have no doubt that the motions judge could reasonably have found a "change 
  of circumstances" and varied the child support order, effective from the 
  date when Mrs. Walsh brought her motion. The substantial increases in Mr. Walsh's 
  income constituted a change of circumstances under s. 14 of the Guidelines. 
  Mr. Walsh effectively recognized this change of circumstances by consenting 
  to increase the amount of child support he was paying once Mrs. Walsh brought 
  her application to vary. </p>
<p>
  [21] What the motions judge could not do was retroactively "adjust" 
  or "recalculate" child support to reflect the payor's increase in 
  income. Nothing in the Divorce Act, the Guidelines or this court's case law 
  gives a judge a freestanding right to recalculate and then adjust child support 
  retroactively. </p>
<p>
  [22] Parliament did not create a regime where child support varies annually 
  with a payor's change in income. Section 25.1 of the Divorce Act does contemplate 
  such a regime: </p>
<p class="indent">
  25.1(1) Agreements with provinces - With the approval of the Governor in Council, 
  the Minister of Justice may, on behalf of the Government of Canada, enter into 
  an agreement with a province authorizing a provincial child support service 
  designated in the agreement to</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> (b) recalculate, at regular intervals, in accordance with the 
  applicable guidelines, the amount of child support orders on the basis of updated 
  income information. </p>
<p>
  But the implementation of this regime requires a provincial agreement with the 
  Minister of Justice, and Ontario has yet to enter into such an agreement.</p>
<p>
  [23] Neither the Divorce Act nor the Guidelines contains any provision giving 
  the court jurisdiction to recalculate child support retroactively because of 
  an increase in the payor's income or the non-disclosure of the payor's actual 
  income. For example, neither the Act nor the Guidelines imposes a duty on a 
  payor to disclose annual increases in income. The parent entitled to receive 
  child support bears the onus of ascertaining increases in the payor's income. 
  Section 25(1) of the Guidelines gives the recipient parent the means to do so 
  by requesting the payor's income tax returns and obliging the payor to comply 
  with the request: </p>
<p class="indent"> 25(1) Continuing obligation to provide income information - 
  Every parent or spouse against whom an order for the support of a child has 
  been made must, on the written request of the other spouse or the person or 
  agency entitled to payment under the order not more than once a year after the 
  making of the order and as long as the child is a child within the meaning of 
  these guidelines, provide that other spouse, or the person or agency entitled 
  to payment under the order, with,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the documents referred to in subsection 21(1) for any of 
  the three most recent taxation years for which the parent or spouse has not 
  previously provided the documents;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) as applicable, any current information in writing, about 
  the status of any expenses included in the order pursuant to subsection 7(1); 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">(c) as applicable, any current information, in writing, about 
  the circumstances relied on by the court in a determination of undue hardship. 
</p>
<p>
  Mrs. Walsh eventually resorted to this provision, four and a half years after 
  the divorce judgment. </p>
<p>
  [24] Many separation agreements provide for an annual exchange of financial 
  information and adjustment of child support in accordance with the Guidelines. 
  The court may also imply a duty of disclosure into a separation agreement in 
  limited circumstances, as this court recently did in Marinangeli v. Marinangeli 
  (2003), 38 R.F.L. (5th) 307. Absent such a contractual duty, however, failure 
  to disclose an increase in income does not allow a court to award a retroactive 
  increase in child support. Instead the payee must ascertain a payor's change 
  in income, apply for a variation, establish a change of circumstances, and if 
  seeking a retroactive order, establish ability to pay and need during the relevant 
  period. </p>
<p>
  [25] Parliament could have made the policy choice to require parties to exchange 
  financial information annually or at some other regular interval and to vary 
  child support in accordance with the Guidelines. Indeed, I see valid grounds 
  for such a policy choice. The right to child support is that of the child, not 
  the custodial parent. The payor's failure to give effect to this right voluntarily 
  and the custodial parent's failure to enforce this right should not deprive 
  the child of the support he or she is entitled to. When child support is not 
  automatically varied in accordance with the Guidelines as the payor's income 
  increases, the child effectively subsidizes the payor's improved standard of 
  living. Moreover, failing to vary child support with undisclosed increases in 
  income rewards conduct that seems inconsistent with the Guidelines. But Parliament 
  has not made this policy choice. </p>
<p>
  [26] Here, the divorce judgment did not impose an express duty on Mr. Walsh 
  to disclose his annual income to Mrs. Walsh. And she could not point to any 
  circumstances from which such a duty could be implied. Therefore, the undisclosed 
  increases in Mr. Walsh's income, substantial as they may have been, did not, 
  standing alone, justify a retroactive increase in child support. </p>
<p>
  [27] To warrant a retroactive increase, Mrs. Walsh had to establish and the 
  motions judge had to find that that the children needed more support and that 
  Mr. Walsh was able to pay more during the relevant period. </p>
<p> [28] Along with need and ability to pay, other factors may also affect the 
  decision to award retroactive child support. Rowles J.A. discusses these other 
  factors in L.S. v. E.P. (1999), 50 R.F.L. (4th) 302 at (B.C.C.A.), leave to 
  appeal to S.C.C. refused [1999] S.C.C.A. No. 444. She lists as considerations 
  in favour of a retroactive order at 320-21: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) the need on the part of the child and a corresponding ability 
  to pay on the part of the non-custodial parent; </p>
<p class="indent">(2) some blameworthy conduct on the part of the non-custodial 
  parent such as incomplete or misleading financial disclosure at the time of 
  the original order; </p>
<p class="indent">(3) necessity on the part of the custodial parent to encroach 
  on his or her capital or incur debt to meet child rearing expenses; </p>
<p class="indent">(4) an excuse for a delay in bringing the application where 
  the delay is significant; and </p>
<p class="indent">(5) notice to the non-custodial parent of an intention to pursue 
  maintenance followed by negotiations to that end.</p>
<p>
  And as considerations mitigating against retroactive orders, Rowles J.A. lists: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) the order would cause an unreasonable or unfair burden 
  to the non-custodial parent, especially to the extent that such a burden would 
  interfere with ongoing support obligations; </p>
<p class="indent">(2) the only purpose of the award would be to redistribute capital 
  or award spousal support in the guise of child support; and </p>
<p class="indent">(3) a significant, unexplained delay in bringing the application. 
</p>
<p>
  These considerations were approved by this court both in Marinangeli at para. 
  72 and Contino v. Leonelli-Contino (2003), 42 R.F.L. (5th) 295 at 322. </p>
<p>
  [29] Mrs. Walsh's affidavit evidence may support a retroactive order. But this 
  order must be justified by applying some or all of the considerations in L.S. 
  v. E.P. to proper findings of fact. And before any factual findings are made, 
  Mr. Walsh is entitled to test Mrs. Walsh's evidence by cross-examination. Thus, 
  the motions judge erred both in ordering a retroactive increase, and in doing 
  so on an interim motion. </p>
<p>
  D. Disposition</p>
<p>
  [30] I would allow the appeal and set aside paragraphs 2, 4 and 5 of the order 
  of the motions judge dated February 26, 2003. The parties may make written submissions 
  on the costs of the motion and the appeal within fifteen days of the release 
  of these reasons. </p>

<hr>
<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#r1">[1]</a> It is technically inaccurate to characterize 
  a child support order as &quot;retroactive&quot; because unlike a truly retroactive 
  order, it does not create an obligation that did not exist before the order 
  was made. The obligation to pay child support arises as soon as a child is born 
  and continues whether or not an action is brought to enforce it. See MacMinn 
  v. MacMinn (1995), 17 R.F.L. (4th) 88 at para. 15 (Alta. C.A.). See also Paras 
  v. Paras (1971), 1 O.R. 130 (C.A.). I use the word retroactive in these reasons 
  for convenience to denote child support that pre-dated an application to vary.</p>
