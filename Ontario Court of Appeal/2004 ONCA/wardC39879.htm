<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] This was essentially a two-witness case. The complainant testified that 
  the appellant pushed her off the roof. The appellant testified that the complainant 
  fell off the roof. After reviewing the evidence the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent"> When reviewing the evidence, I came to the conclusion that 
  the evidence of the complainant was acceptable when compared to that of the 
  accused. I do so having considered a number of matters which have the ring of 
  truth and that, in my mind, relates particularly to the events as she described 
  them on the roof concerning the son and his concern about the son and as indicated 
  by the Crown, this may well have pushed a button in the accused's mind.</p>
<p class="indent">In listening to her evidence and I watched her extremely closely. 
  Due to her background, I was concerned with regard to her credibility, and in 
  my view she was not trying to minimize the issues which were against her in 
  that she acknowledges having had a fight with the accused; that she has attempted 
  to stab him, and accordingly I find that when comparing the two and in making 
  a decision as to who I believe between the accused and the complainant, I accept 
  the complainant's evidence without hesitation. [emphasis added]</p>
<p>
  [2] Later in his reasons, the trial judge said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Thus, in making a decision as to the accused's evidence I am satisfied that 
  not only do I not believe his evidence, but it does not raise a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [3] The trial judge made two discrete but related errors. First of all, he determined 
  credibility on an either/or basis and by comparing the evidence of the two main 
  witnesses. The trial judge did not appear to recognize that he was not obliged 
  to accept the credibility of either witness. Secondly, the trial judge never 
  considered whether despite his complete rejection of the appellant's evidence 
  and his acceptance of the complainant's credibility, he was satisfied beyond 
  a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt based on the complainant's evidence. 
  Given the evidence in this case, there was a real possibility that the complainant, 
  though credible, could not carry the entire burden of the Crown's case.</p>
<p>
  [4] These errors necessitate the quashing of the conviction. The appeal is allowed. 
  The conviction is quashed and a new trial is ordered.</p>
