<p>On appeal from the judgment of Regional Senior Justice Robert A. Blair of the 
  Superior Court of Justice dated January 18, 2002. </p>
<p>BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  I. OVERVIEW</p>
<p>
  [1] Wasauksing First Nation (the "WFN") is a native community on an 
  island in Lake Huron. Back in the 1960s, to gain revenues for its members, the 
  WFN decided to lease part of its land as cottage lots. Because the Indian Act, 
  R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5 prohibits Indian Bands from alienating land (except to the 
  Crown), in 1971 the respondent, Wasausink Lands Inc. ("WLI") was incorporated 
  to lease the lots, and collect and manage the rents. </p>
<p>
  [2] Between 1971 and 1994 the chief and band council of the WFN controlled WLI. 
  In 1994 and 1995 the chief and council at the time - now individual respondents 
  - reorganized WLI, formally separating its governance from that of the WFN. 
  The individual respondents remain the directors of WLI. Since 1997, however, 
  the WFN has elected a new chief and band council - the appellants - who object 
  to the respondents' management of WLI. </p>
<p>
  [3] At its core, this litigation is about who controls WLI. The appellants contend 
  that the members of the WFN are members of WLI and that the chief and council 
  of the WFN are the rightful directors of WLI. They rely on the practice that 
  existed between 1971 and 1994. The respondents, on the other hand, contend that 
  control of WLI, its members and directors, must be determined by the corporation's 
  letters patent and by-laws, and by the provisions of the Corporations Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. 38 (the Act).</p>
<p>
  [4] The appellants sought relief from the requirements of the Act and put forward 
  a number of arguments in support of that relief. After a long trial, Blair R.S.J., 
  in lengthy and thorough reasons, dismissed their application. The appellants 
  now appeal to this court on three grounds: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) the trial judge erred in failing to give effect to their 
  claim by rectifying the corporate registers of WLI under s. 309(1) of the Act;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) in the alternative, this court should impose in their favour 
  a constructive trust on the current directors and officers of WLI; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) in the further alternative, the trial judge erred in failing 
  to grant them a constitutional exemption from the requirements of the Act by 
  recognizing an aboriginal right under s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.</p>
<p>
  II. FACTS</p>
<p>
  [5] The facts in this case were exhaustively reviewed in the reasons for judgment 
  of the trial judge, reported at [2002] O.J. No. 164. It is therefore unnecessary 
  to engage in a further detailed review of the evidence. For the purpose of these 
  reasons, it will suffice to provide a general outline of the facts in order 
  to put our analysis and conclusions in context. What follows, therefore, is 
  a summary of the facts based upon the review of the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [6] The WFN peoples were originally Ojibways. Approximately 400 members of the 
  WFN live on a reserve located on Parry Island in Georgian Bay adjacent to the 
  Town of Parry Sound. An additional 600 or so members of the WFN live off the 
  reserve.</p>
<p>
  [7] Sometime in the 1950s, the WFN conceived the idea of renting some of their 
  reserve lands on Parry Island for cottage lots as a means of generating income 
  for the various needs of the reserve. However, the Indian Act, supra, prevented 
  the transfer of an interest in real property by aboriginals, except to the Crown.</p>
<p>
  [8] In order to comply with the Indian Act, 244 lots to be rented for cottage 
  use were surrendered to the Crown in the early 1960s. The federal crown agreed 
  to hold the rents received in trust for the benefit of the WFN. However, it 
  was not long before the band council of the WFN began to look for ways to exercise 
  more control over this enterprise and, in particular, the funds derived from 
  it. As a result of discussions with representatives of Indian and Northern Affairs 
  Canada (INAC), the federal government agreed to the incorporation of a company 
  which would enter into a head lease with the Crown for the 244 cottage lots. 
  WLI entered into the head lease and then sublet the lots to the cottagers. </p>
<p>
  [9] The letters patent of WLI provide that the corporation is "to foster 
  and advance the interests of the Ojibways of Parry Island Band (now the Wasauksing 
  First Nation)" and "to do all things as are incidental or conducive 
  to the obtainment of those objects". </p>
<p>
  [10] WLI was established in 1971 as the economic development agency of the WFN. 
  In addition to managing the cottage lots and collecting the rents, it operated 
  or managed various other properties, businesses and projects.</p>
<p>
  [11] The original applicants for incorporation of WLI were Flora Tabobondung 
  (then the chief of the WFN), Hubert Tabobondung, Matilda Tabobondung, Leslie 
  E. Tabobondung and Ernest Partridge (the Original Incorporators). All of these 
  persons, except for Leslie Tabobondung, were members of the WFN band council 
  at the time of WLI's incorporation. Leslie Tabobondung became a member of the 
  band council in 1972. The Original Incorporators were also the first directors 
  of WLI.</p>
<p>
  [12] Until the 1990s, WLI appeared to operate as an integral part of the activities 
  of the band council. The trial judge summarized the situation as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is clear on the evidence that in practical terms, between 1971 and Fall 1993, 
  the Chief and Council in office from time to time acted as de facto directors 
  of WLI and were accepted as such by the members of the [WFN] and by the Federal 
  Government and all concerned parties dealing with WLI. I find that this was 
  so. However, there is no evidence of any meetings of WLI members having ever 
  been held to elect these persons as directors. It seemed to follow from their 
  election as Chief and Council that they were expected to fill the role.</p>
<p>
  Band council general meetings were usually followed by WLI meetings. Both meetings 
  were open to all members of the WFN.</p>
<p>
  [13] In February 1993, Joyce Tabobondung was elected chief of a new WFN band 
  council. The new chief and her council reviewed the affairs of the WFN and WLI 
  and concluded that there were serious financial and organizational issues that 
  needed to be addressed. The WFN was indebted to the bank in the amount of $630,000. 
  WLI's overdraft at the bank was $70,000. The new band council concluded that 
  the affairs of WLI needed to be separated from the affairs of the WFN. In order 
  to proceed with a new organization plan, they retained the services of three 
  consultants: one to review the financial affairs; one to review the cottage 
  leasing operation; and one to review the organizational structure of the WFN 
  and WLI.</p>
<p>
  [14] The review by the financial consultant revealed that the funding, provided 
  by the federal government through INAC, was insufficient to cover the expenses 
  of the WFN. For several years, WLI had been making payments to the WFN to cover 
  the shortfall. </p>
<p>
  [15] In 1994 and 1995, the new band council, under Joyce Tabobondung, initiated 
  the reorganization of WLI as a separate entity from the WFN (the 1994 Reorganization). 
  This involved the admission of some new members of the corporation and changes 
  to the board of directors of WLI, all of which is detailed in the reasons for 
  judgment of the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [16] The new band council and WLI negotiated an operating agreement, which was 
  intended to provide a protocol to govern the relationship between the two organizations. 
  The agreement was signed in the spring of 1995. The operating agreement was 
  described by the trial judge as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The provisions for the management of WLI are central to the raison d'&ecirc;tre 
  behind the Operating Agreement. The Agree-ment recognized that the WLI directors 
  were responsible for the day-to-day operations of the corporation and that they 
  were to develop and carry out various development and business plans in that 
  regard. However, to ensure that the general direction of WLI's activities was 
  consistent with the policies of the [WFN] as they were established from time 
  to time, the WLI directors were restricted in various ways in what they could 
  do without WFN approval. In particular, the Operating Agreement stipulated that 
  WLI: </p>
<p class="indent">&middot; would only accept as members of the corporation individuals 
  who had been approved by the [WFN] from a short list proposed by WLI;</p>
<p class="indent">&middot; would limit the compensation payable to directors;</p>
<p class="indent">&middot; would obtain the [WFN's] prior written approval,</p>
<p class="indent10">&middot; of the auditor of WLI</p>
<p class="indent10">&middot; of any proposed by-law or application for supplementary 
  letters patent of WLI</p>
<p class="indent10">&middot; for spending more than 50% of WLI's annual operating 
  revenues on operating expenses in any one year, or more than 25% of annual operating 
  revenues on capital investments in any one financial year, or to incur cumulative 
  debt in excess of 75% of annual operating revenues in any financial year; and 
  finally,</p>
<p class="indent">&middot; was not to proceed with any activities unless they 
  had been outlined in a business plan approved by the [WFN].</p>
<p class="indent">The Operating Agreement also required WLI to forward financial 
  statements, provide a review of operations, and submit business plans and an 
  outline of requirements to the [WFN]. Any individual authorized by WFN was to 
  be entitled to access to the books and records of WLI on 48 hours written notice. 
  In addition, under Article 3 WLI was to pay certain sums to WFN, including 25% 
  of its net annual income.</p>
<p>
  [17] The reorganization of WLI and the execution of the operating agreement 
  unfortunately did not result in an improvement in the financial affairs of the 
  WFN. During the tenure of Joyce Tabobondung and her council, the financial situation 
  continued to deteriorate. As a result, INAC appointed a third party manager 
  to manage and administer the funds provided by the federal government to the 
  WFN.</p>
<p>
  [18] Not long after the appointment of the third party manager, a crisis developed 
  over the provision of schooling for the children of the WFN. In August 1996, 
  the parents of school-aged children were informed by the Parry Sound Board of 
  Education that their children could not attend the local schools in September 
  due to a failure of the band council to pay the required tuition fees.</p>
<p>
  [19] The upshot of this crisis and other contentious issues that arose at the 
  time was that Joyce Tabobondung and her fellow councillors were defeated in 
  an election held in February 1997. John Beaucage replaced Joyce Tabobondung 
  as the chief.</p>
<p>
  [20] Although the third party manager eventually paid the outstanding tuition 
  fees, the education crisis placed John Beaucage and his new council in a series 
  of confrontations with the members and directors of WLI led by Joyce Tabobondung.</p>
<p>
  [21] When Mr. Beaucage and his councillors were elected, they began to attempt 
  to roll back many of the changes brought about as a result of the organization 
  of WLI under the Joyce Tabobondung council. Mr. Beaucage and his new council 
  refused to communicate with WLI directors in regard to WLI business plans. As 
  well, they repudiated the operating agreement and declined to proceed with the 
  implementation of other arrangements and agreements that had been made between 
  the Joyce Tabobondung council and WLI before the election of February 1997.</p>
<p>
  [22] At the centre of the dispute between John Beaucage and his followers and 
  Joyce Tabobondung and her followers is the issue of whether or not all members 
  of the WFN are members of WLI. Beaucage and his fellow councillors asserted 
  that all members of the WFN are indeed members of WLI.</p>
<p>
  [23] Finally, in December 1997, the band council, John Beaucage and others began 
  this litigation against WLI, Joyce Tabobondung and others. In their application, 
  the appellants sought a range of remedies. As relevant to this appeal, they 
  sought a declaration that all members of the WFN are members of WLI, a declaration 
  that the duly elected chief and council of the WFN are the directors of WLI, 
  and an order rectifying the company's registers of members and of directors 
  as necessary. The trial judge declined to grant this declaratory relief and 
  dismissed the appellants' rectification claim.</p>
<p>
  [24] The appellants also sought an order declaring that the WFN's custom and 
  practice of the band council governing and managing its affairs on behalf of 
  its members is constitutionally exempt from the application of the Act. The 
  trial judge declined to grant this relief.</p>
<p>
  [25] In addition, the appellants sought an order declaring that the operating 
  agreement of September 12, 1995 is invalid or, alternatively, unenforceable 
  against the WFN. In that connection, during the proceedings before the trial 
  judge, the respondents initially supported the operating agreement as a valid 
  and legally-binding document. However, at the conclusion of the trial, they 
  elected to accept the appellants' repudiation of the operating agreement. Consequently, 
  the trial judge had no alternative but to declare that the operating agreement 
  had been terminated and that it is no longer of any force and effect.</p>
<p>
  [26] The trial judge refused to grant any of the other relief sought by the 
  appellants. </p>
<p>
  III. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) Rectification Claim </p>
<p>
  [27] The appellants argue that from the time of WLI's incorporation in 1971, 
  the WFN community understood that all members of the WFN were to be members 
  of WLI and that the persons elected from time to time as the WFN's chief and 
  as councillors of the WFN band council were to be the directors of WLI (collectively, 
  the WFN Understanding). </p>
<p>
  [28] The appellants also maintain, as detailed in their factum filed on this 
  appeal, that WLI was created "to ensure that the entire [WFN] community 
  could control its assets and resources for the benefit of the community". 
  They submit that the formal constating records of WLI mistakenly fail to give 
  effect to this fundamental objective and to the underlying "open, inclusive, 
  representative and consensus-based" decision-making customs, practices 
  and traditions of the WFN. Thus, the appellants contend, WLI's corporate records 
  fail to give effect to the "very reason why the corporation was set up".</p>
<p>
  [29] The appellants submit that this deficiency constitutes a substantive error 
  in the corporate records of WLI that is susceptible to rectification under s. 
  309(1) of the Act. In that regard, they maintain that s. 309(1) should receive 
  a broad and liberal construction to give effect to the customs, practices and 
  traditions of the WFN, a unique aboriginal and cultural community. </p>
<p>
  [30] Sections 309(1), (2) and (5) of the Act provide: </p>
<p class="indent"> s. 309(1) If the name of a person is, without sufficient cause, 
  entered in or omitted from the minutes of proceedings mentioned in section 299 
  or from the documents or registers mentioned in sections 41 and 300, or if default 
  is made or unnecessary delay takes place in entering therein the fact of any 
  person having ceased to be a shareholder or member of the corporation, the person 
  or shareholder or member aggriev-ed, or any shareholder or member of the corporation, 
  or the corporation itself, may apply to the court for an order that the minutes, 
  documents or registers be rectified, and the court may dismiss such application 
  or make an order for the rectification of the minutes, documents or registers, 
  and may direct the corporation to compensate the party aggrieved for any damage 
  the party has sustained.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The court may, in any proceeding under this section, decide 
  any question relating to the entitlement of a person who is a party to such 
  proceeding to have the person's name entered in or omitted from such minutes, 
  documents or registers, whether such question arises between two or more shareholders 
  or members or alleged shareholders or members, or between any shareholder or 
  member or alleged shareholder or member and the corporation.</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent"> (5) This section does not deprive any court of any jurisdiction 
  it otherwise has.</p>
<p>
  [31] The trial judge concluded that the members of WLI are the Original Incorporators 
  of WLI, as modified during the 1994 Reorganization and thereafter, and that 
  the current directors of WLI are the respondents Dora, Leslie and Florence Tabobondung 
  rather than the current elected chief and members of the WFN band council. He 
  also made the following key findings of fact: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) WLI was not incorporated with the intention that all members 
  of the WFN would be members of the corporation, nor with the intention that 
  the WFN itself would be a member of WLI; </p>
<p class="indent">(ii) WLI was established as a limited, rather than as a universal, 
  membership corporation; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the original directors of WLI were still in place when 
  the 1994 Reorganization of WLI was undertaken. In addition, the 1994 Reorganization 
  was itself properly carried out and was initiated by a validly elected chief 
  and band council of the WFN.</p>
<p>
  [32] The trial judge rejected the appellants' claim for rectification on two 
  grounds. First, he held that the requisite factual underpinning for the rectification 
  claim had not been established at trial. Second, he held that the rectification 
  remedy under s. 309(1) of the Act does not extend to the type of relief sought 
  by the appellants concerning WLI. </p>
<p>
  [33] We conclude that the trial judge was correct to hold that the rectification 
  remedy under s. 309(1) is not available to the appellants in the circumstances 
  of this case. We reach this conclusion for the reasons that follow.</p>
<p>
  (i) Factual Underpinning for the Rectification Claim</p>
<p>
  [34] In considering the trial judge's findings regarding the factual underpinning 
  for the appellants' rectification claim, it is useful to consider the provisions 
  of WLI's constating records first. </p>
<p>
  (a) Constating Records of WLI - Membership</p>
<p>
  [35] It is common ground that WLI's letters patent and by-laws do not support 
  the alleged WFN Understanding, either with respect to membership in WLI or concerning 
  the composition of its board of directors. The appellants seek rectification 
  of WLI's corporate records for that reason.</p>
<p>
  [36] The letters patent of WLI provide that a charter is issued to the Original 
  Incorporators of WLI "constituting them and any others who become members 
  of the Corporation hereby created a corporation without share capital under 
  the name of [WLI]" for specific objects. </p>
<p>
  [37] This language in the letters patent is significant. By stipulating that 
  persons other than the Original Incorporators can "become" members 
  of WLI, the letters patent provide for a limited membership of five persons 
  in WLI - the Original Incorporators - subject to expansion of the membership 
  over time. During the 1994 Reorganization of WLI, certain of the Original Incorporators 
  ceased to be members of WLI and new members were added in their stead. The membership 
  of WLI was not then expanded, however, as it might have been, to include all 
  members of the WFN. Indeed, the letters patent of WLI have never expressly provided 
  for universal membership in WLI. To the contrary, as the trial judge held, the 
  language used in the letters patent suggests that there was no intention at 
  the time of WLI's creation that it be established as a universal membership 
  corporation. </p>
<p>
  [38] The appellants argue that universal membership applies to WLI because members 
  of the WFN community were treated and admitted as members of WLI by successive 
  band councils of the WFN. They emphasize that universal membership is a foundational 
  concept within the WFN community, requiring that WFN community assets be managed 
  and controlled in an "open, inclusive, representative and consensus-based 
  manner". Sections 124(1) and (2) of the Act, however, provide that the 
  admission of a person or an unincorporated association as a member of a not-for-profit 
  corporation must be effected by resolution of the board of directors of the 
  corporation unless the letters patent, supplementary letters patent or by-laws 
  of the corporation provide for the admission of members by virtue of their office. 
  WLI's letters patent do not invoke this exception by providing for the admission 
  of members to WLI by virtue of their offices in the WFN. In addition, there 
  is no suggestion that any resolutions of WLI's board of directors were passed 
  prior to the 1994 Reorganization of WLI to alter or add to WLI's membership. 
  </p>
<p>
  [39] Moreover, no amendment of WLI's letters patent has ever been sought or 
  obtained to amend the membership of WLI for the purpose of giving effect to 
  the WFN Understanding regarding membership in WLI.</p>
<p>
  [40] Prior to the 1994 Reorganization, no formal by-laws were passed by the 
  directors of WLI. An unsigned by-law, which the trial judge accepted was at 
  one time appended to WLI's letters patent in its formal minute books, provided 
  that membership in WLI "shall consist of the [Original Incorporators] and 
  such other persons as are admitted as members by the board of directors". 
  The trial judge held that this draft by-law "was probably never enacted 
  and in force". Nonetheless, its provisions regarding membership are instructive. 
  Like the letters patent, it contemplated a limited membership in WLI that might 
  be expanded prospectively by WLI's board of directors. As the trial judge remarked, 
  this draft by-law "is at least some indication of the incorporators' intentions 
  at the time". </p>
<p>
  [41] A general by-law regulating the affairs of the corporation was approved 
  on September 10, 1994 as part of the 1994 Reorganization of WLI ("By-law 
  No. 1"). By-law No. 1 also provides for limited, rather than universal, 
  membership in WLI, subject to prospective enlargement of the membership by WLI's 
  board of directors. Accordingly, the only by-law of WLI that appears to have 
  been formally enacted and that addresses membership in WLI, is inconsistent 
  with the universal membership concept advanced by the appellants. </p>
<p>
  [42] Thus, none of WLI's constating records provide for universal membership 
  in WLI in accordance with the WFN Understanding. Consequently, WLI's other corporate 
  records, including its register of members, make no provision for the membership 
  in WLI of all members of the WFN.</p>
<p>
  (b) Constating Records of WLI - Board of Directors</p>
<p>
  [43] Similarly, WLI's letters patent make no provision for persons becoming 
  directors of WLI by virtue of their offices or positions with the WFN, as is 
  permissible under s. 127 of the Act, and no amendment to the letters patent 
  was ever sought or obtained in that regard. The letters patent provide that 
  the Original Incorporators are the first directors of WLI, that they are to 
  hold office for two years, and that the election of directors is to take place 
  every two years. </p>
<p>
  [44] WLI's By-law No. 1 regularized the procedures for the election of directors. 
  It provides that the members of WLI, by resolution passed by at least two-thirds 
  of the votes cast at a general meeting of members, may remove any director before 
  the expiration of his term of office and, by a majority of the votes cast at 
  that meeting, may elect any person in his stead for the remainder of his term.</p>
<p>
  [45] Section 287(2) of the Act requires the election of directors of a corporation 
  on a yearly basis unless the by-laws of the corporation otherwise provide. Section 
  287(1) provides that directors are to be elected by the shareholders or members 
  of the corporation in general meeting. Prior to the 1994 Reorganization, no 
  formal general meetings of the original members of WLI were held for the election 
  of directors.</p>
<p>
  [46] Section 284(1) of the Act provides that the persons named as first directors 
  in the instrument creating a corporation are the directors of the corporation 
  until replaced. Section 287(4) of the Act states that if an election of directors 
  is not held at the time required by the Act, the directors continue in office 
  until their successors are elected. The effect of these provisions, in the absence 
  of an election of directors at a properly constituted meeting of the members 
  of WLI, was to continue the original directors of WLI - the Original Incorporators 
  - as the directors of WLI. </p>
<p>
  (c) WFN Understanding</p>
<p>
  [47] Nonetheless, the appellants claimed at trial and submit before us that 
  the WFN Understanding has governed the composition of the membership and of 
  the board of directors of WLI from 1971 to date. The basis of this claim was 
  succinctly described by the trial judge: </p>
<p class="indent">
  How, then, do the Applicants say "others" - i.e. all members of the 
  First Nation, including newborns - have "become" members? Essentially, 
  they say this is so because everyone believed themselves to be members, and 
  were treated as such. More elegantly, perhaps, they submit: </p>
<p class="indent"> a) that from 1971 until at least 1993, the community members 
  of the [WFN] understood and believed that they were all members (or "shareholders") 
  of WLI, and that they were treated as such by the acting WLI directors who were 
  the successively elected Chiefs and Band Council members of the [WFN];</p>
<p class="indent">b) that the members of the [WFN] elected their Chiefs and Band 
  Council members from time to time, and that those elections were considered 
  to be elections for the board of directors of WLI as well, because the same 
  individuals performed both functions; and,</p>
<p class="indent">c) that successive Chiefs and Band Councillors acted at all 
  times as the de facto directors of WLI, and were accepted by the members of 
  the [WFN] as such [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [48] The core issue at trial regarding the appellants' contention that all members 
  of the WFN were intended, and understood to be, members of WLI, concerned the 
  meaning of the term "member of WLI". In respect of those who felt 
  that "membership" in the WFN was co-extensive with membership in WLI, 
  the trial judge was required to determine whether "membership" meant 
  membership as that term is used under the Act, that is, in the context of the 
  regulation of corporations, or whether "membership" meant something 
  else. The trial judge framed this central question in this way: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Did they mean "member" in the corporate-law sense, as contemplated 
  by the Letters Patent and governing legislation? Or did they mean "member" 
  in a more general way, i.e., as reflective of a sense of belonging and of recognition 
  that the proceeds from the leased lots were for the benefit of the [WFN] and 
  were to be used in [its] best interests?</p>
<p>
  [49] The trial judge held that "the latter meaning&#133;more closely reflects 
  the views held by members of the [WFN]". He elaborated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am not able to find a factual basis for concluding that all members of WFN 
  are - or were intended at the time of incorporation to be - the corporate "members" 
  of WLI. Nor am I able to conclude that the reorganization of WLI from a de facto 
  situation where the members of Chief and Council as elected from time to time 
  acted as the directors of WLI during their term [of] office, to a board of directors 
  properly elected by the members of the Corporation in accordance with the provisions 
  of the Letters Patent, the new By-law, and the governing corporate law legislation, 
  was improperly carried out.</p>
<p>
  [50] The trial judge accepted that at least some members of the WFN "understood 
  and believed that they and all members of the [WFN] were members of WLI and 
  that the community members were treated as such by successive Band Councils". 
  However, after a detailed review of the evidence regarding the beliefs and perceptions 
  of WFN members concerning membership in WLI, the trial judge made the following 
  critical findings: </p>
<p class="indent">
  After reviewing all of the evidence, including the foregoing excerpts and documentation, 
  I am prepared to accept that there was a widespread feeling amongst members 
  of the [WFN] that they were a part of WLI - or, perhaps more accurately, that 
  it was a part of them as the [WFN] - and that this sense of belonging was perceived 
  in some loose sense as "membership". However, I am not prepared to 
  find that there was a general understanding or belief amongst all, or even a 
  majority of the members of the [WFN], that all members of the [WFN] were "members" 
  of WLI - in corporate law terms - simply by virtue of the fact that they were 
  members of the [WFN]. Some members of the [WFN] may have had that understanding 
  and belief. Others, however, did not. Most, I conclude, simply believed that 
  the members of the [WFN] were "members" of WLI in the sense that WLI 
  belonged to the members of the [WFN] and was obligated to act, and to use its 
  resources, for the general benefit of the Wasauksing community [emphasis in 
  original].</p>
<p>
  [51] In connection with the composition of WLI's board of directors, as we have 
  said, the trial judge accepted that although no formal election of directors 
  was carried out by the members of WLI prior to 1994, as a practical matter, 
  the persons elected from time to time as the chief and the councillors of the 
  band council of the WFN served as the de facto directors of WLI between December 
  1971 and the Fall of 1993. Thereafter, the 1994 Reorganization was undertaken 
  by the elected chief and band council of the WFN. The trial judge's assessment 
  of the significance of these facts was expressed in the following terms: </p>
<p class="indent"> [T]he original directors of the Corporation were technically 
  still in place at the time Chief Joyce Tabobondung and her Council initiated 
  the reorganization - in their capacity as de facto directors - in 1994.</p>
<p class="indent">The fact that it was the de facto board of directors of WLI 
  who initiated the reorganization is a significant consideration. Even if it 
  could be argued that the foregoing&#133;could be overcome by the long-standing 
  practice of the [WFN] to accept newly elected Chiefs and Council members as 
  the acting directors of WLI, the reality is that it was just such a board of 
  directors who instituted the change.</p>
<p class="center">
  …</p>
<p class="indent"> It is not as if the original members and directors of WLI rose 
  suddenly like a phoenix from the ashes to wrest control of WLI from the Chief 
  and Council. The reorganization was initiated by a validly elected Chief and 
  Council, who were acting at the same time - as the Applicants submit they should 
  have been - as the de facto board of directors, in order to regularize a long-standing 
  hiatus in the proper corporate administration and structuring of WLI [emphasis 
  in original].</p>
<p>
  [52] In our view, the trial judge's factual findings concerning the membership 
  and the directors of WLI pose an insurmountable barrier to the appellants' rectification 
  claim under s. 309(1) of the Act.</p>
<p>
  [53] An appellate court will not interfere with a trial judge's findings of 
  fact absent a palpable and overriding error in the trial judge's appreciation 
  of the evidence: see Equity Waste Management of Canada v. Halton Hills (Town) 
  (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.); Robert McAlpine Ltd. v. Byrne Glass Enterprises 
  Ltd. (2001), 141 O.A.C. 167 (C.A.); and Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 
  235.</p>
<p>
  [54] The appellants do not challenge the trial judge's factual findings concerning 
  the intentions of the parties who incorporated WLI. Nor do they directly attack 
  his conclusions regarding the composition of WLI's membership or of its board 
  of directors. Rather, in effect, they submit that the trial judge misapprehended 
  the evidence concerning the WFN Understanding and erred by applying "black 
  letter" corporate law principles to his consideration of the issues concerning 
  the membership and the directors of WLI. We would not give effect to these submissions.</p>
<p>
  [55] Various members of the WFN testified at trial concerning their beliefs 
  and perceptions regarding membership in WLI. These witnesses included several 
  former chiefs and members of the band council of WFN, some of the Original Incorporators, 
  and various WFN members who previously worked with or for WLI. The testimony 
  of these witnesses, as a whole, indicates that from and after the incorporation 
  of WLI in 1971 members of the WFN held no uniform or consistent belief or understanding 
  regarding the corporate structure of WLI and the basis for entitlement to membership 
  in WLI.</p>
<p>
  [56] For example, the trial testimony of some WFN members suggested that member-ship 
  in WLI arose as a matter of birthright, that is, members of the WFN automatically 
  became members of WLI because they were "born into it". Other members 
  of the WFN testified that they believed that every person who was registered 
  on the WFN band membership list was automatically considered to be a member 
  of WLI. Many members of the WFN testified that all WFN members had an "interest" 
  in WLI, or in the lands controlled by WLI, because they had given up part of 
  their land or because WLI was created for their benefit. In that context, some 
  of the Original Incorporators of WLI testified that they did not believe that 
  members of the WFN were members of WLI but, rather, that they had an interest 
  in the lands managed by WLI.</p>
<p>
  [57] This evidence indicates that the level of understanding by members of the 
  WFN concerning the corporate framework of WLI and the concept of legal membership 
  in the corporation was uneven. Moreover, the testimony at trial concerning the 
  beliefs and perceptions of members of the WFN regarding membership in WLI was 
  inconsistent. In many instances, it was also conflicting and unclear.</p>
<p>
  [58] Thus, it was open to the trial judge on the record before him to find, 
  as he effectively did, that there was no "general understanding or belief 
  amongst all, or even a majority of the members of the [WFN] that all members 
  of the [WFN] were "members" of WLI - in corporate law terms - simply 
  by virtue of the fact that they were members of the [WFN]".</p>
<p>
  [59] We note in this regard that the appellants themselves state in their factum 
  filed on this appeal that prior to the 1994 Reorganization of WLI, "most" 
  members of the WFN regarded themselves as members of WLI and considered the 
  councillors on the WFN's band council to be the directors of WLI. This statement 
  is inconsistent with the universal membership concept for WLI that is otherwise 
  urged by the appellants.</p>
<p>
  [60] Other evidence at trial also supports the trial judge's finding regarding 
  the membership of WLI. In particular, this finding is supported by the evidence 
  concerning the way in which decisions were made regarding the affairs of WLI 
  and the reasons for the original membership structure of WLI.</p>
<p>
  [61] The historical approach to decision-making concerning WLI is especially 
  telling in this connection.</p>
<p>
  [62] As we have previously indicated, meetings of WLI were usually held after 
  WFN band council meetings and were generally open to all members of the WFN. 
  The trial judge found as a fact that although members of the WFN attended and 
  participated in WLI meetings, they did not vote on issues relating to the affairs 
  of WLI or on any resolutions concerning WLI. </p>
<p>
  [63] The appellants do not dispute this finding. However, they assert that it 
  is of no moment because, in accordance with the customs, practices and traditions 
  of the WFN, members of the WFN only vote on issues when no consensus can otherwise 
  be reached. They also argue that WFN members did not vote on matters concerning 
  WLI because the meetings in question were meetings of WLI's directors, rather 
  than of its members. We would not give effect to these submissions.</p>
<p>
  [64] While we accept that the traditional decision-making process of the WFN 
  is characterized by the search for consensus rather than by formal vote-taking, 
  we agree with the trial judge that the fact that WFN members did not vote on 
  matters concerning WLI is significant. The trial judge found as a fact that 
  meetings of the members of WLI were held from at least the time of the 1994 
  Reorganization. Members of the WFN did not vote, or seek to vote, at those meetings 
  concerning the affairs of WLI. By now seeking to rectify the corporate records 
  of WLI to confer membership status under the Act on all members of the WFN, 
  thereby obtaining the legal right to vote on the affairs of WLI, the appellants 
  essentially seek the right to a form of participation in the decision-making 
  of WLI that they have not exercised to date.</p>
<p>
  [65] In rejecting the alleged WFN Understanding, the trial judge also had regard 
  to the original membership structure of WLI. </p>
<p>
  [66] The trial judge noted that the structure of WLI at the time of its incorporation, 
  which contemplated only five original members and directors, was designed to 
  ensure that WLI obtained and maintained status as a non-taxable, not-for-profit 
  corporation under the Act. He correctly observed that not-for-profit corporations 
  are restricted at law in the payments and distributions that they may make to 
  their members. The trial judge stated: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Universal&#133;membership in WLI might well jeopardize the use of the corporation's 
  resources for purposes benefiting [WFN] members, through programs such as loans 
  to individual [WFN] members and the land share distributions which have occurred. 
  In short, there were very cogent reasons for WLI having been incorporated with 
  only a few members to operate it and carry out its objects to advance the overall 
  interests of the [WFN], as opposed to having been incorporated with a universal 
  membership.</p>
<p>
  [67] Although the appellants dispute this finding, there was evidence before 
  the trial judge to support his conclusion that the original limited membership 
  structure of WLI was deliberate, not accidental, and driven, at least in part, 
  by tax exemption considerations. Those factors negate the assertion of a common 
  understanding by the members of the WFN that they were all members of WLI. </p>
<p>
  [68] In the end, the trial judge correctly observed that: "An individual 
  does not become a member or shareholder of a corporation through belief or understanding, 
  no matter how genuinely that belief and understanding may be held." The 
  correctness of that proposition is not contested by the appellants. </p>
<p>
  [69] Accordingly, there was evidence adduced at trial upon which a trier of 
  fact, acting judicially, could conclude that membership in the WFN is not synonymous 
  with membership in WLI. In addition, in our view, the evidence established that 
  there was no legal basis upon which to conclude that the persons who served 
  as the WFN's elected chief and members of band council also automatically enjoyed 
  status as directors of WLI.</p>
<p>
  [70] The factual foundation for the appellants' claim for rectification of WLI's 
  corporate records is predicated on acceptance of the alleged WFN Understanding. 
  The burden of establishing the WFN Understanding at trial rested on the appellants. 
  We do not agree with the appellants' contention that the trial judge misapprehended 
  the evidence concerning the WFN Understanding. Rather, as he was entitled to 
  do on the record before him, he simply concluded that the appellants had not 
  discharged their evidential burden to establish the existence of the WFN Understanding 
  and, hence, the factual underpinning for their rectification claim.</p>
<p>
  [71] We also do not accept the appellants' submission that the trial judge erred 
  by applying "black letter" corporate law principles to his assessment 
  of the issues concerning the membership and the board of directors of WLI. The 
  Act is an enactment of general application. Section 88 of the Indian Act, supra, 
  provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Subject to the terms of any treaty and any other Act of Parliament, all laws 
  of general application from time to time in force in any province are applicable 
  to and in respect of Indians in the province, except to the extent that such 
  laws are inconsistent with this Act or any order, rule, regulation or by-law 
  made thereunder, and except to the extent that those laws make provision for 
  any matter for which provision is made by or under this Act [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [72] By its stipulation that provincial laws of general application "are 
  applicable to and in respect of Indians in the province", s. 88 of the 
  Indian Act renders the Act applicable to the issues of the composition of the 
  membership and of the board of directors of WLI. Accordingly, unless membership 
  in and the governance of WLI are constitutionally exempt from the application 
  of the Act - an argument that we address later in these reasons - the trial 
  judge did not err in applying the provisions of the Act to his analysis of these 
  issues.</p>
<p>
  [73] The trial judge's finding that the appellants had failed to establish the 
  factual underpinning for their rectification claim is itself dispositive of 
  this claim. It is therefore technically unnecessary to address the conclusions 
  of the trial judge concerning the scope of the rectification remedy under s. 
  309(1) of the Act. However, as considerable time was spent on this issue by 
  the parties in their oral and written submissions to this court, we will comment 
  on it briefly. </p>
<p>
  (ii) Rectification Under Section 309(1) of the Act</p>
<p>
  [74] Sections 309(1), (2) and (5) of the Act, in combination, afford discretion 
  to a court to rectify specific corporate records, to award compensation to an 
  aggrieved party for damages occasioned by a proven corporate records deficiency, 
  and to determine the entitlement of any person who is a party to a rectification 
  application to have their name entered in or omitted from the corporate records 
  in question. In this case, the appellants seek rectification of the registers 
  of members and of directors of WLI for the purpose of recognizing and giving 
  effect to the WFN Understanding. </p>
<p>
  [75] Section 309(1) does not expressly delineate the scope of the rectification 
  remedy established thereunder; nor does it set out the circumstances under which 
  the remedy may be granted. Moreover, there is no developed jurisprudence concerning 
  the rectification remedy under s. 309(1) of the Act. What, then, is the scope 
  of the remedy contemplated by s. 309(1) and what pre-conditions, if any, must 
  be satisfied in order to obtain the remedy?</p>
<p>
  [76] In Snell's Equity, 30th ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell Ltd., 2000) at 
  693, J. McGhee describes the equitable remedy of rectification in these terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If by mistake a written instrument does not accord with the true agreement between 
  the parties, equity has power to reform, or rectify, that instrument so as to 
  make it accord with the true agreement. What is rectified is not a mistake in 
  the transaction itself, but a mistake in the way in which that transaction has 
  been expressed in writing. Courts of Equity do not rectify contracts; they may 
  and do rectify instruments purporting to have been made in pursuance of the 
  terms of the contract [footnotes omitted].</p>
<p>
  See also J.E. Martin, Modern Equity, 16th ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell Ltd., 
  2001) at 866-67.</p>
<p>
  [77] The pre-conditions to the granting of rectification were considered by 
  the English Court of Appeal in Joscelyne v. Nissen, [1970] 2 Q.B. 86 at 98. 
  The court held in that case that an applicant seeking rectification of a written 
  agreement must demonstrate, on "convincing proof", that the parties 
  had a common intention, antecedent to the formal document in question and evidenced 
  by some outward expression of accord, that continued unchanged until the time 
  that the formal document was executed by the parties and that the formal document 
  mistakenly did not conform to the prior common intention. In Peter Pan Drive-In 
  Ltd. v. Flambro Realty Ltd. (1978), 22 O.R. (2d) 291 (H.C.J.), aff'd (1980), 
  26 O.R. (2d) 746 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused 1 S.C.R. xi and John 
  Austin &amp; Sons Ltd. v. Smith (1982), 35 O.R. (2d) 272 (C.A.), this court 
  accepted the Joscelyne formulation as a correct statement of the modern rule 
  concerning the pre-conditions to rectification. See also Dynamex Canada Inc. 
  v. Miller (1998), 161 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 97 (Nfld. C.A.) and Public Service 
  Alliance of Canada v. NAV Canada (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 284 at paras. 44-45 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [78] Recently, in Performance Industries Ltd. v. Sylvan Lake Golf &amp; Tennis 
  Club Ltd., [2002] 1 S.C.R. 678, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the equitable 
  remedy of rectification. Unlike this case, the central issue in Sylvan Lake 
  concerned the conditions precedent to rectification in cases of alleged unilateral, 
  rather than mutual, mistake. Nonetheless, the following observations at para. 
  31 by Binnie J., writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, are instructive: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Rectification is predicated on the existence of a prior oral contract whose 
  terms are definite and ascertainable. The plaintiff must establish that the 
  terms agreed to orally were not written down properly. The error may be fraudulent, 
  or it may be innocent&#133;The court's task in a rectification case is corrective, 
  not speculative. It is to restore the parties to their original bargain, not 
  to rectify a belatedly recognized error of judgment by one party or the other.</p>
<p>
  [79] Later in his reasons, in considering the standard of proof applicable in 
  rectification cases, Binnie J. stated at paras. 41-42: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The modern approach, I think, is captured by the expression "convincing 
  proof", i.e., proof that may fall well short of the criminal standard, 
  but which goes beyond the sort of proof that only reluctantly and with hesitation 
  scrapes over the low end of the civil "more probable than not" standard.</p>
<p>
  [80] It is also important to emphasize that rectification is available only 
  in cases of genuine mistake. It does not apply in instances of ambiguity or 
  mistaken assumption. McGhee in Snell's Equity, supra, makes this point at 696: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Further, what is relevant is "the intention of the parties at the time 
  when the deed was executed, and not what would have been their intent if, when 
  they executed it, the result of what they did had been present to their minds." 
  There can thus be no rectification if the omission of a term was deliberate, 
  even if this was due to an erroneous belief that the term was unnecessary or 
  that it was sufficiently dealt with in the antecedent oral agreement, or that 
  the term was illegal, or a breach of covenant, and similarly if the instrument 
  intentionally contains a provision which in fact means something different from 
  what the parties thought it meant. Rectification ensures that the instrument 
  contains the provisions which the parties actually intended it to contain, and 
  not those which it would have contained had they been better informed [footnotes 
  omitted and emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  See also S.M. Waddams, The Law of Contracts, 4th ed. (Toronto: Canada Law Book 
  Inc., 1999) at 239-40.</p>
<p>
  [81] As relevant to the appellants' rectification claim, the following principles 
  concerning equitable rectification emerge from the foregoing authorities. Rectification 
  is available in the exercise of the court's discretion. Such discretion is not 
  to be exercised lightly but, rather, only where it is demonstrated that, by 
  mistake, a written document or instrument does not accord with or accurately 
  reflect the agreement or arrangements intended by the parties. Rectification 
  is not used to vary the intentions of the parties, or to speculate on the substance 
  of those intentions; rather, it is designed to correct a mistake in carrying 
  out the settled intentions of the parties as established by the evidence. As 
  well, and importantly, rectification is not available to correct erroneous assumptions 
  or beliefs as to what was intended; the remedy seeks to effect the actual intentions 
  of the parties which, by mistake, were not accurately recorded. Finally, a heavy 
  burden rests on the party seeking rectification to establish on convincing proof: 
  (i) the existence and nature of a common intention by the parties prior to the 
  making of the document or instrument alleged to be deficient; (ii) that this 
  common intention remained unchanged at the date that the document or instrument 
  was made; and (iii) that the challenged document or instrument, by mistake, 
  does not conform to the parties' prior common intention.</p>
<p>
  [82] In this case, the trial judge denied the appellants' rectification claim 
  in the exercise of his discretion under s. 309(1) of the Act. The jurisdiction 
  of an appellate court to review the exercise of judicial discretion is strictly 
  constrained. We are not in a position to interfere with the trial judge's decision 
  to deny rectification unless it is clearly demonstrated that he wrongfully exercised 
  his discretion by giving no weight, or insufficient weight, to relevant considerations: 
  see Reza v. Canada, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 394 at 404-05: Friends of Oldman River Society 
  of Canada (Minister of Transport), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3 at 76-77; and Harelkin 
  v. University of Regina, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 561 at 588. We conclude that this exacting 
  standard of review is not met in this case, for four reasons.</p>
<p>
  [83] First, all of the necessary pre-conditions to the granting of rectification 
  are not satisfied here.</p>
<p>
  [84] The appellants were obliged to demonstrate on convincing evidence that 
  there was a common intention among the members of the WFN community that the 
  membership and governance of WLI be structured and maintained in accordance 
  with the alleged WFN Understanding. This required proof of a common intention 
  that WLI be structured and operated as a universal membership corporation, that 
  is, that all members of the WFN would also be members of WLI.</p>
<p>
  [85] The defining moment in the search for a common intention is the time antecedent 
  to when the challenged document or instrument, in respect of which rectification 
  is sought, was made. Here, the relevant time is prior to the incorporation of 
  WLI in 1971. The trial judge held that the evidence of what happened at the 
  time of the incorporation of WLI, and of what the WFN was then told and understood, 
  was neither extensive nor clear. He also rejected the appellants' claim that 
  the WFN Understanding existed after the creation of WLI. Accordingly, a critical 
  pre-condition to the granting of rectification - proof of an existing common 
  intention among the members of the WFN concerning the membership and governance 
  of WLI - has not been satisfied on convincing evidence.</p>
<p>
  [86] Second, we agree with the trial judge's conclusion that no error exists 
  in the corporate records of WLI that requires rectification. The trial judge 
  found as a fact that WLI was created as a limited membership corporation. Since 
  there was no convincing demonstration at trial of a common intention that universal 
  membership apply to WLI, there is no "mistake" in the corporate records 
  of WLI to be rectified. </p>
<p>
  [87] Third, we do not agree that the trial judge interpreted s. 309(1) of the 
  Act too narrowly, or that he misconstrued the purpose of the rectification remedy 
  established under that provision.</p>
<p>
  [88] The trial judge stated in connection with the nature and scope of the rectification 
  remedy under s. 309(1): </p>
<p class="indent">
  In my opinion, s. 309 is designed to permit the rectification of clerical errors 
  or mistakes in completing corporate records and registers. Its purpose is not 
  to permit the restructuring or reorganization by judicial fiat of a corporation's 
  shareholding structure or membership, or the crafting of new by-laws for the 
  corporation, which is in effect what the [appellants] seek in these proceedings. 
  "Rectification", according to The Shor-ter Oxford English Dictionary, 
  means "the correction of error; a setting straight or right". Section 
  309 is a rectification provision, not a restructuring or reorganization provision 
  [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [89] The change to WLI's membership register sought by the appellants would 
  fundamentally alter the composition of the membership of WLI notwithstanding 
  that the requested change has not been authorized in accordance with the provisions 
  of the Act that regulate the membership of not-for-profit corporations. In addition, 
  the changes sought by the appellants to WLI's registers of members and directors, 
  in combination, would effectively re-write the provisions of By-law No. 1 and 
  effect a significant realignment of the structure of WLI and a re-distribution 
  of control over it.</p>
<p>
  [90] We agree with the trial judge that the rectification remedy under s. 309(1) 
  is not designed to facilitate such far-reaching corporate changes. Rather, its 
  purpose is to permit the correction of unintended or inadvertent clerical errors 
  or mistakes in the completion of corporate records and registers. It is not 
  intended as a tool to resolve complex corporate disputes by facilitating, through 
  the exercise of judicial discretion, fundamental changes that intrude on established 
  internal corporate affairs. It is also not intended as a device to secure an 
  exemption from substantive requirements of the Act concerning the regulation 
  of a corporation's structure or affairs.</p>
<p>
  [91] Finally, we do not accept the appellants' argument that an expansive interpretation 
  of s. 309(1) of the Act is required in this case because its invocation is sought 
  in an aboriginal context. </p>
<p>
  [92] The appellants rely on R. v. Nowegijick, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 29, a case which 
  concerned the issue of whether income earned by a registered Indian living on 
  a reserve was exempt from taxation under the Income Tax Act, 1970-71-72 (Can.), 
  c. 63 by virtue of s. 87 of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-6. In considering 
  this issue, the Supreme Court of Canada stated at 36: </p>
<p class="indent">
  It is legal lore that, to be valid, exemptions to tax laws should be clearly 
  expressed. It seems to me, however, that treaties and statutes relating to Indians 
  should be liberally construed and doubtful expressions resolved in favour of 
  the Indians&#133;In Jones v. Meehan, 175 U.S. 1 (1899), it was held that Indian 
  treaties "must&#133;be construed, not according to the technical meaning 
  of [their] words&#133;but in the sense in which they would naturally be understood 
  by the Indians [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  As appears from this passage, the principle of statutory construction referenced 
  by the Supreme Court applies to "treaties and statutes relating to Indians". 
  See also, in the tax exemption rights context, Mitchell v. Peguis Indian Band, 
  [1990] 2 S.C.R. 85 at paras. 13-15 and, in the context of band taxation tribunal 
  by-laws, Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Matsqui Indian Band, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 3 at 
  67. </p>
<p>
  [93] None of the Nowegijick, Mitchell or Matsqui Indian Band cases suggests 
  that this interpretive principle applies to the construction of statutory provisions 
  of general application, like s. 309(1) of the Act. </p>
<p>
  [94] As well, we do not understand the interpretive principle formulated in 
  Nowegijick to mandate the expansive interpretation of laws of general application 
  where such a reading is not otherwise warranted. Were it otherwise, as the trial 
  judge observed, laws of general application concerning corporations could be 
  interpreted so as to create one form of statutory regime for aboriginals and 
  another form of statutory regime, concerned with the same subject matter, for 
  non-aboriginals. Nowegijick, Mitchell and Matsqui Indian Band do not dictate 
  or support such an outcome. To the contrary, as observed by the Supreme Court 
  in Nowegijick at p. 36: "Indians are citizens and, in affairs of life not 
  governed by treaties or the Indian Act, they are subject to all of the responsibilities, 
  including payment of taxes, of other Canadian citizens." </p>
<p>
  [95] The appellants also argue that an expansive interpretation of a statutory 
  provision is warranted in the aboriginal context if it is demonstrated that 
  an established aboriginal practice conflicts with the applicable statutory provision. 
  Support for this proposition may be found in Re Adoption of Katie E7-1807 (1961), 
  32 D.L.R. (2d) 686 (N.W.T.C.) and Casimel v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia 
  (1993), 82 B.C.L.R. (2d) 387 (B.C.C.A.). See also, in the context of membership 
  in an unincorporated association, Lakeside Colony &amp; Hutterian Brethren v. 
  Hofer, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 165.</p>
<p>
  [96] This argument rests on proof of an established aboriginal practice or custom 
  that is at odds with the requirements of the enactment in question. It is unsustainable 
  on the facts here.</p>
<p>
  [97] The trial judge held, in connection with the appellants' argument that 
  the WFN's custom and practice of governing and managing its affairs through 
  band council is constitutionally exempt from the application of the Act, that 
  there is no established aboriginal practice to operate or manage a corporation. 
  We discuss the appellants' constitutional exemption argument later in these 
  reasons. For the purpose of the interpretation of s. 309(1) of the Act, however, 
  we agree with the respondents' submission that the alleged WFN Understanding, 
  even if it had been established at trial, does not itself constitute an aboriginal 
  practice or custom merely because the community at issue is aboriginal. Stated 
  somewhat differently, aboriginal peoples engage in many activities, and may 
  hold many beliefs, that do not attract the status of aboriginal practices and 
  customs.</p>
<p>
  [98] We also agree with the trial judge's conclusion that the Re Adoption of 
  Katie E7-1807 and Casimel decisions do not assist the appellants. In those cases, 
  unlike the case at bar, the asserted aboriginal practice or custom was established 
  to the satisfaction of the court and the relevant provincial legislation was 
  interpreted and applied in light of the proven aboriginal practice or custom. 
  In this case, the asserted practice or custom, which involves the membership 
  and governance of a not-for-profit corporation, was not established at trial. 
  There is no suggestion that the WFN community had a settled practice or custom 
  concerning the corporate records of WLI, or regarding the application of the 
  Act to WLI.</p>
<p>
  [99] For all of these reasons, we conclude that the trial judge did not err 
  in rejecting the appellants' claim for rectification under s. 309(1) of the 
  Act.</p>
<p>
  (2) Trust Claim</p>
<p>
  [100] As an alternative to the relief sought under s. 309(1) of the Act, the 
  appellants submit that this court should impose a constructive trust on the 
  directors and officers of WLI. In oral argument they framed their trust submission 
  in one of two ways: either that WLI, its officers and directors, hold legal 
  title to the corporation for the benefit of the WFN and its members, or that 
  the directors and officers of WLI must vote at meetings of the corporation as 
  directed by the band council. In advancing this submission the appellants rely 
  on the four conditions for imposing a constructive trust set out by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in Soulos v. Korkontzilas, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 217. </p>
<p>
  [101] The appellants did not ask for a declaration of a constructive trust at 
  trial. They sought this relief for the first time on appeal. On that ground 
  alone we decline to give effect to their submission. </p>
<p>
  [102] The ordinary rule is that a party cannot raise a new issue on appeal. 
  An appellate court may depart from this ordinary rule and entertain a new issue 
  where the interests of justice require it and where the court has a sufficient 
  evidentiary record and findings of fact to do so. </p>
<p>
  [103] The appellants do not meet these requirements for departing from the court's 
  ordinary practice. Soulos was decided in 1997. Thus, its four conditions for 
  imposing a constructive trust were known more than three years before this trial 
  began. These four conditions are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> (i) the defendant must have been under an equitable obligation, 
  that is, an obligation of the type that courts of equity have enforced, in relation 
  to the activities giving rise to the assets in his hands;</p>
<p class="indent">(ii) the assets in the hands of the defendant must be shown 
  to have resulted from deemed or actual agency activities of the defendant in 
  breach of his equitable obligation to the plaintiff;</p>
<p class="indent">(iii) the plaintiff must show a legitimate reason for seeking 
  a proprietary remedy, either personally or related to the need to ensure that 
  others like the defendant remain faithful to their duties; and</p>
<p class="indent">(iv) there must be no factors which would render imposition 
  of a constructive trust unjust in all circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>
  [104] Because the question of a constructive trust was not raised at trial, 
  neither side led evidence on these conditions, and the trial judge made no findings 
  on them. We do not have a proper record to make findings on these conditions. 
  Moreover, doing so would be unfair to the respondents. For example, the second 
  condition requires the court to consider whether the respondents were guilty 
  of wrongdoing. A party facing an allegation of wrongdoing ought to be given 
  an opportunity to lead evidence to meet the allegation. The respondents were 
  denied this opportunity. The third and fourth conditions require the court to 
  engage in a broad inquiry into the justness of a constructive trust. In this 
  case, that inquiry would have to be conducted in the absence of a proper evidentiary 
  basis to make such a determination.</p>
<p>
  [105] For these reasons, we are not persuaded that it is in the interests of 
  justice to entertain the constructive trust argument on its merits. We therefore 
  decline to give effect to this submission. </p>
<p>
  (3) Constitutional Exemption Claim</p>
<p>
  [106] Finally, the appellants sought a constitutional exemption from the requirements 
  of the Act. The WFN asked the court to recognize that WFN members have an aboriginal 
  right under s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act to control and manage the assets 
  of the community in a way that respects their traditional practices and customs. 
  That traditional practice or custom, according to the appellants, is marked 
  by "open, inclusive, representative and consensus-based decision-making". 
  To give effect to this traditional practice or custom, the WFN wanted this court 
  to ignore the corporate structure and organization of WLI, and instead permit 
  the band council to manage the corporation. We found no merit in this submission 
  and did not call on the respondents to answer it. </p>
<p>
  [107] The trial judge correctly applied the framework set out by the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075, R. v. Van der Peet, 
  [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507 and Mitchell v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue), [2001] 
  1 S.C.R. 911 for establishing an aboriginal right protected by s. 35(1). As 
  well, he accurately characterized (at para. 285 of his reasons) the right the 
  appellants asserted. </p>
<p>
  [108] As the trial judge pointed out, in Van der Peet Lamer C.J.C. emphasized 
  at para. 46 that "in order to be an aboriginal right an activity must be 
  an element of a practice, custom or tradition integral to the distinctive culture 
  of the aboriginal group claiming the right". Yet on the record before him, 
  the trial judge found that the appellants did not meet this requirement. In 
  his words, they "have failed to establish an evidentiary foundation sufficient 
  to form the basis for a finding that the traditional pre-European contact practices 
  and the aboriginal right they seek to establish existed and continued to exist". 
  The trial judge's finding is entitled to deference on appeal. We are not persuaded 
  that it was tainted by any palpable and overriding error. On that ground alone 
  the constitutional exemption claim must fail. </p>
<p>
  [109] Moreover, we also agree with the trial judge's conclusion that even if 
  the appellants had established the aboriginal right they assert, the Act does 
  not infringe that right. The appellants could have structured WLI in a way that 
  gave effect to the open, inclusive and consensus-based decision-making they 
  espouse. But they did not do so. Now they seek to invoke a constitutional exemption 
  to circumvent the corporate structure they established in 1971 and modified 
  in 1994. This they cannot do. For these reasons we do not give effect to their 
  request for a constitutional exemption. </p>
<p>
  IV. CONCLUSION</p>
<p>
  [110] We agree with the trial judge that the appellants are not entitled to 
  relief under s. 309(1) of the Act or to a constitutional exemption from the 
  requirements of the Act. We decline to deal with the appellants' trust claim. 
  This argument was not raised at trial and we do not have either a proper evidentiary 
  record or findings of fact to consider it on appeal. The appeal is therefore 
  dismissed. The respondents are entitled to their costs of the appeal on a partial 
  indemnity basis, which we fix in the amount of $35,000 inclusive of disbursements 
  and Goods and Services Tax. </p>
