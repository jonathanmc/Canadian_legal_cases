<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] Ontario New Home Warranty Program ("ONHWP") appeals from the 
  judgment of Sanderson J. dismissing its third party action against Kenneth Good 
  as guarantor under a guarantee given in support of Berrier Hill's application 
  to ONHWP for registration as a vendor/builder under the Ontario New Home Warranties 
  Plan Act.</p>
<p>
  [2] Berrier Hill made two applications for registration, which were submitted 
  for approval to a body known as the Registrar's Advisory Committee. The first 
  application was made in late February or early March 1989; the second, in late 
  April 1989. The first application was rejected; the second was approved. There 
  were material differences between the two applications, including the fact that 
  the first application called for construction of 354 condominium units, whereas 
  the second application called for construction of 246 condominium units. </p>
<p> [3] There were two guarantees in evidence at the trial. One, which bore the 
  authentic signature of the respondent, was undated (the "undated guarantee"). 
  The other, on which the respondent's signature was forged, was dated April 26th, 
  1989 (the "forged guarantee"). While the trial judge made no finding that the 
  undated guarantee accompanied the first application, she did find (as appears 
  below) that the guarantee that was before the Committee when the second application 
  was considered and approved was the forged guarantee. In her reasons, she made 
  a number of findings, including the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the documents considered by the Committee to be the relevant and operative 
    documents in support of Berrier Hill's second, and successful, application 
    for registration included the forged guarantee;</li>
  <li>the undated guarantee was not before the Committee at the time it approved 
    the second application;</li>
  <li>in approving that application, the Committee accepted the forged guarantee; 
    and</li>
  <li>the forged guarantee was invalid and unenforceable against Mr. Good.</li>
</ul>
<p>[4] These findings - which are fatal to ONWHP's position on this appeal - were 
  supported by the evidence adduced at the trial, and we are not persuaded that 
  the trial judge committed any palpable and overriding error in making them. 
  </p>
<p>
  [5] The appeal is dismissed with costs, fixed in the sum of $8,600.00, inclusive 
  of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
