<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] While there was a lack of precision in the approach taken by Crown counsel 
  at trial with respect to the similar fact evidence and a similar lack of precision 
  in the trial judge's ruling on the voir dire, we are not persuaded that there 
  was any reversible error. The evidence was, in our view, clearly relevant and 
  admissible to the issues at the trial and, in any event, the similar fact evidence 
  does not appear to have figured in the trial judge's reasons for a conviction.</p>
<p>
  [2] We see no significant or deliberate departure from the required standard 
  on the part of Crown counsel in cross-examining the appellant at trial, nor 
  do we accept the submission that the conduct of Crown counsel prejudiced the 
  appellant's right to a fair trial.</p>
<p>
  [3] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [4] With respect to the sentence appeal, the appellant has already served the 
  custodial portion of the sentence, but he does seek leave to appeal the term 
  of probation. In our view, in light of his serious record, and in light of the 
  nature of this offence, a probationary period was entirely appropriate.</p>
<p>
  [5] Accordingly, we would grant leave to appeal sentence, but dismiss the appeal.</p>
