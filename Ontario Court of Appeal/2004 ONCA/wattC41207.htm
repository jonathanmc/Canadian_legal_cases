<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: June 4, 2004</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from the order of Farley J. dated January 6, 2004 
  and asks this court to set aside that order.</p>
<p>[2] The respondents brought a motion to quash the appeal. This court determined 
  that portions of the order were final and other portions were interlocutory. 
  As a result, the appeal is now restricted to those portions of the order that 
  were determined to be final, namely, the allegations in the appellant&#146;s 
  Amended Statement of Claim in paragraphs 1(1), (2), (8), (9), (10), (11) and 
  (14).</p>
<p>[3] The appellant also seeks to overturn the costs order of the motions judge 
  and alleges bias as against the motions judge.</p>
<p>[4] For the reasons that follow, we are of the opinion that the appeal should 
  be dismissed.</p>
<p>[5] Before turning to the substantive matter raised on appeal, however, we 
  would note that Farley J. found that Mr. Charles Mark appeared on the motion 
  as special counsel for Beallor, having been retained by Fraser Milner Cosgrain 
  LLP. That is a finding that was entirely open to the motions judge.</p>
<p>1) Striking out</p>
<p>[6] In our view, the impugned paragraphs are all properly struck out, as an 
  exercise of discretion, on the basis of res judicata, abuse of process or vexatious 
  proceedings.</p>
<p>[7] In so concluding, we are mindful that discretionary orders are to be overturned 
  only where the discretion has been exercised on a wrong principle of law or 
  where a clear error has been made.</p>
<p>[8] The motions judge articulated the correct legal principles, carefully considered 
  the evidence before him (including the matter&#146;s long history and multiple 
  prior orders) and gave thorough reasons. On the record, we see no error in his 
  reasoning or decision. We need not repeat the many determinations Farley J. 
  made, rather, we make the following observations. In relation to the allegations 
  of breach of fiduciary duty and negligence (the house claim being based on the 
  negligence claim), these matters could have been raised before the Master in 
  the various and numerous hearings before the Master.</p>
<p>[9] And, in relation to the appellant&#146;s claims for lost income as a lawyer 
  and loss of law practice, we agree with Farley J. that there is no air of reality 
  to such claims given that the appellant had been disbarred by the Law Society 
  of Upper Canada for misappropriation of client trust funds.</p>
<p>2) The Costs Order</p>
<p>[10] The appellant asserts that the motions judge lacked jurisdiction to make 
  a costs order because the respondents did not provide a bill of costs to the 
  motions judge at the end of the motion.</p>
<p>[11] The requirement to serve a bill of costs on a motion arises only when 
  the motion disposes of a proceeding. See R. 57.01(5) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. 
  The motion below did not dispose of the appellant&#146;s proceeding as the appellant 
  was granted leave to reconstitute his Amended Statement of Claim. There was, 
  therefore, no requirement that the respondents serve a bill of costs. </p>
<p>[12] Costs is a matter within the discretion of the motions judge. In his reasons 
  for decision, Farley J. noted that at the hearing of the motion, counsel for 
  the various parties were asked for their views as to costs on a &#147;win, lose 
  or draw&#148; basis. The appellant&#146;s counsel submitted a bill for $16,741.69 
  albeit on the basis of a full day hearing whereas the motion took only a half-day. 
  Counsel for the respondents submitted that costs should be on the basis of $15,000 
  to the successful party. We see no error in the costs order of $15,000 to the 
  respondents.</p>
<p>3) The Allegation of Bias</p>
<p>[13] The appellant questions whether there was bias shown by the motions judge. 
  In support, the appellant points to the fact that this court overturned a decision 
  of the motions judge in a related matter and, thereafter, against the appellant&#146;s 
  wishes, the motions judge granted a further motion of the respondents to have 
  the action transferred from the General List to the Commercial List. It is on 
  these facts that the appellant raises the question of bias.</p>
<p>[14] The test for disqualification of a judge is that of a reasonable apprehension 
  of bias. The facts argued in support of this ground do not come close to meeting 
  the threshold.</p>
<p>[15] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. Costs to the respondents on a partial 
  indemnity basis fixed at $11,000, inclusive of GST and disbursements. </p>
