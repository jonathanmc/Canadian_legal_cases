<p>On appeal from the judgments of Justice Mary Anne Sanderson of the Superior 
  Court of Justice dated June 27, 2002, reported at (2002) 25 B.L.R. (3d) 1.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  I</p>
<p>
  INTRODUCTION</p>
<p> <a name="1"></a>[1] Isaac Waxman arrived in Canada from Poland in 1911. Within 
  a few years, he was providing for his growing family by selling scrap metal 
  and other junk he collected using a horse and wagon. By the time Isaac died 
  in 1972, his modest enterprise had become a multi-million dollar family business 
  operating as I. Waxman and Sons Ltd. ("IWS"). </p>
<p>
  [2] Isaac's sons, Morris and Chester, began to work in the business in the 1940s. 
  Blessed with strong work ethics, different and complementary skills, and a complete 
  trust in each other, the brothers played a large role in the growth and prosperity 
  of the business throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In the years immediately following 
  Isaac's death in 1972, Morris and Chester continued to run the business together. 
  Each owned fifty per cent of the shares of IWS and for all intents and purposes, 
  treated the business as a partnership. It continued to grow and prosper. There 
  was every reason to believe that this remarkable family success story would 
  continue into a third generation of Waxmans, Morris's two sons and Chester's 
  three sons.</p>
<p>
  [3] By 1988, everything had changed. The love and mutual respect between Chester 
  and Morris were gone, replaced by the powerful animosity that only a bitter 
  lawsuit among family members can generate. The brothers and their sons have 
  spent much of the last fifteen years and many, many millions of dollars trying 
  to prove that each was cheated by the other. The accusations and recriminations 
  run the full gamut from the dishonourable through the dishonest to the downright 
  criminal. Whatever the eventual legal outcome, Isaac's dream that his two sons 
  should "share and share alike" in the business he started has been 
  shattered.</p>
<p>
  [4] These appeals are the latest round in this protracted and bitter fight. 
  Chester and those aligned with him were largely unsuccessful at trial. They 
  challenge almost every aspect of the trial judgments. Morris and his supporters 
  resist Chester's appeals and appeal against the one part of the trial judgment 
  that went against Morris and his supporters.</p>
<p> [5] Because of the length of the trial and the complexity of the issues, these 
  reasons are lengthy and, on occasion, repetitive. In essence, we have concluded 
  that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>there is no basis upon which to interfere with any of the significant findings 
    of fact; </li>
  <li>there is no basis upon which to interfere with the findings of liability;</li>
  <li>the quantification of damages flowing from those findings should be varied 
    downward to a relatively minor degree; and</li>
  <li>Morris's appeal should fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  II</p>
<p>
  OVERVIEW OF THE PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>
  [6] In December 1998, some ten years after Morris Waxman first commenced legal 
  proceedings, five actions proceeded to trial before Sanderson J. The trial lasted 
  over two hundred court days. In June 2002, Sanderson J. delivered lengthy reasons 
  in which she found in Morris's favour on most claims. </p>
<p> <a name="7"></a>[7] Three of the actions involved claims by Morris against 
  Chester, his sons Robert, Warren and Gary, and IWS. In two of those actions 
  Chester counterclaimed against Morris and his family, including his son Michael. 
  In addition to these three actions, Morris commenced a fourth action against 
  Paul Ennis, his lawyer, and a fifth action against IWS's accountants, Taylor 
  Leibow, and IWS's comptroller, Wayne Linton.</p>
<p> [8] The claims and counterclaims in the five actions revolve around the operations 
  of two corporate entities, IWS and Solid Waste Reclamation Inc. ("SWRI"). The 
  claims concerning IWS ("the IWS claims" or "the main action"), relate to the 
  ownership of the shares in that company after December 1983, and the operation 
  of IWS between 1979 and 1988. In essence, Morris alleged that Chester breached 
  his fiduciary duty to Morris by cheating Morris out of his fifty per cent interest 
  in IWS and further breached that duty by operating IWS between 1979 and 1988 
  to the personal advantage of Chester and his sons, and to the exclusion of the 
  legitimate interests of Morris and his sons. Morris claimed that Chester and/or 
  his sons: </p>
<ul>
  <li>caused Morris unwittingly to sign documents transferring Morris's fifty 
    per cent interest in IWS to Chester in December 1983; at the same time caused 
    Morris, again unwittingly, to sign lease documentation purporting to lease 
    properties jointly owned by Morris and Chester to IWS on terms that were grossly 
    unfair to Morris's interests; (For convenience we will refer to these purported 
    transactions as the "share sale" and the "lease".)</li>
  <li>after 1983, excluded Morris from his fifty per cent participation in the 
    equity and profits of IWS;</li>
  <li>improperly distributed the equity of IWS to themselves by way of bonuses 
    in 1979, 1981 and 1982;</li>
  <li>under the guise of providing trucking services to IWS, improperly diverted 
    assets belonging to IWS to corporate entities owned by Chester's sons, Robert 
    and Gary, and controlled by Robert; and</li>
  <li>improperly fired Morris as president of IWS in October 1988.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [9] Morris also advanced his IWS claims relying on the oppression provisions 
  of the Ontario Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16 ("OBCA"). 
  </p>
<p>
  [10] Morris's suit against Ennis arose out of the share sale in December 1983. 
  He contended that Ennis, who was his long-time lawyer, acted negligently and 
  in breach of the duty that he owed to Morris in connection with the share sale 
  and lease in December 1983. </p>
<p>
  [11] Morris claimed against Taylor Leibow and Linton in relation to both the 
  share sale and the alleged improper diversion of the assets and equity of IWS 
  to Chester and his sons. Morris alleged that Taylor Leibow and Linton breached 
  the duty of care they owed to Morris in connection with those transactions. 
  </p>
<p>
  [12] Chester denied the IWS claims. He contended that far from misappropriating 
  IWS assets or diverting profits from the company after 1979, he and his sons 
  led IWS to an era of unparalleled prosperity. Chester claimed that during a 
  difficult recession in 1982, Morris decided that he wanted to sell his interest 
  in IWS. After lengthy negotiations, Chester agreed to buy Morris's shares. Morris 
  did not want to tell his family about the sale, so he and his brother agreed 
  that he would keep the office of president and many of the benefits connected 
  with that position to preserve appearances. Chester contended that Morris came 
  to regret the sale of his shares when IWS flourished under the leadership of 
  Chester and his sons. Instead of taking responsibility for the decision he made 
  to sell his shares, Morris, urged on by his son Michael, falsely accused Chester, 
  Ennis, Linton and Taylor Leibow of misleading him and taking advantage of him. 
  Lastly, Chester argued that IWS had ample cause to fire Morris in October 1988 
  as by that time he was actively working against the business interests of IWS. 
  </p>
<p>
  [13] Morris's SWRI claims arise out of events which occurred in 1988 and 1989, 
  after the business and personal relationship between Morris and Chester had 
  broken down. Morris and Michael ran SWRI from 1982 onward. SWRI was in the refuse 
  business and had extensive dealings with Philip Environmental Inc. ("Philip"). 
  Morris alleged that in 1988 Chester set out to destroy the business of SWRI 
  as part of a strategy to impoverish Morris so that he could not pursue his IWS 
  claims against Chester. Morris alleged that Chester and Robert, using various 
  means, including applying economic pressure on Philip and forging documents, 
  caused Philip to stop doing business with SWRI, thereby leading to the breach 
  of Philip's agreement with SWRI and ruining the business of SWRI. </p>
<p>
  [14] Chester denied the SWRI claims, and in counterclaims advanced his own SWRI 
  claims. Chester contended that he and Robert learned of the business affairs 
  of SWRI in 1988 and became concerned that Morris was operating his own business 
  to the detriment of IWS. Chester testified that he became aware of the SWRI 
  operation before Morris sued him. Chester contended that Morris issued the IWS 
  claims as a pre-emptive strike only after Morris learned that Chester and Robert 
  had discovered that Morris and Michael were using SWRI to steal business from 
  IWS. In the counterclaim Chester alleged that Morris and Michael used SWRI to 
  divert business opportunities and profits from IWS to themselves between 1982 
  and 1989. He also advanced several relatively minor miscellaneous claims against 
  Morris and Michael. In a second counterclaim brought by Chester in the inducing 
  breach of contract action, Chester alleged that his children owned fifty per 
  cent of the SWRI shares and that Morris had attempted to falsify the books and 
  records of SWRI to make it appear as though his two sons owned all of the shares 
  of the company.</p>
<p> [15] Morris was largely successful at trial. On the IWS claims, the trial 
  judge held that Morris had not sold his shares to Chester in December 1983 and 
  that Chester held those shares in trust for Morris from December 1983 onward. 
  She ordered the shares returned to Morris. In addition, she held that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Morris was entitled to fifty per cent of the profits generated by IWS and 
    fifty per cent of any equity distributed by IWS to Chester and his sons between 
    December 1983 and the release of her reasons in June 2002. She directed a 
    reference to determine the amount of those profits and provided formulae for 
    that determination; </li>
  <li>Morris was entitled to punitive damages of $350,000 from Chester and IWS;</li>
  <li>Morris was entitled to recover fifty per cent (minus certain payments that 
    had been made to him) of bonuses paid to Chester and his sons by IWS in the 
    years 1979, 1981 and 1982;</li>
  <li>Morris was entitled to recover certain profits ($1,180,073) improperly diverted 
    from IWS to corporate entities that provided trucking services to IWS and 
    were controlled by Robert;</li>
  <li>Morris was improperly dismissed as president of IWS in October 1988 and 
    was entitled to damages from IWS equal to two years salary; and</li>
  <li>Morris was entitled to recover $98,000 for Chester's breach of contract 
    in relation to the transfer by Morris in 1986 of his property in Ancaster, 
    Ontario to Warren, Chester's oldest son.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [16] Morris's claims against IWS under the oppression provisions of the OBCA 
  also succeeded. The trial judge held that Morris could recover from IWS his 
  share sale damages, the damages arising from the improper bonus payments, and 
  the damages related to the improper diversion of IWS profits to trucking companies 
  controlled by Robert. </p>
<p>
  [17] The trial judge made tracing orders with respect to the distributions of 
  profit from IWS between December 22, 1983 and June 27, 2000, the improper payment 
  of bonuses, and the wrongful diversion of IWS profits to companies owed by Chester's 
  sons. She declared that for the purposes of the tracing orders, Chester's sons 
  were not bona fide purchasers for value without notice. </p>
<p>
  [18] Morris also succeeded on his IWS claim against his lawyer, Ennis. The trial 
  judge concluded that Ennis was liable for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of 
  contract and negligence in connection with the share sale transaction and that 
  Morris was entitled to damages from Ennis measured in the same way as the damage 
  assessment made against Chester in connection with the share sale. </p>
<p>
  [19] The trial judge concluded that Morris had made out his IWS claims against 
  Linton and that Morris was entitled to recover from Linton the amounts awarded 
  in connection with the share sale, the improper bonus payments and the improper 
  diversion of IWS profits to corporate entities controlled by Chester's sons. 
  </p>
<p>
  [20] Morris's claims against Taylor Leibow were dismissed.</p>
<p>
  [21] Morris also succeeded on the SWRI claims. The trial judge held that Chester, 
  Robert and IWS had induced Philip to breach its contracts with SWRI. She awarded 
  damages in the amount of $2.5 million plus punitive damages of $100,000. Chester's 
  counterclaims were dismissed save for some limited success on the miscellaneous 
  components of his counterclaim. He was awarded damages totalling about $76,000.</p>
<p>
  [22] Chester appeals. He challenges most, if not all, of the critical findings 
  of fact made by the trial judge. Chester also raises many legal issues relating 
  to liability, the appropriateness of the non-pecuniary remedies awarded by the 
  trial judge, and her damage assessments.</p>
<p>
  [23] Ennis appeals. He attacks the trial judge's findings of fact and further 
  argues that even if those findings stand, the trial judge erred in awarding 
  a "trust" level of damages against him.</p>
<p>
  [24] Linton appeals. He also challenges the trial judge's findings of fact and 
  specifically contends that the finding that he was liable for knowing assistance 
  or collusion with Chester and his sons in the structuring of the share sale, 
  the improper payment of bonuses, and the diversion of profits from IWS was unfounded 
  in fact and unavailable in law.</p>
<p>
  [25] Morris appeals the dismissal of the action against Taylor Leibow. He argues 
  that the trial judge erred in law in holding that Taylor Leibow did not owe 
  him a duty of care in connection with the improper diversion of IWS profits 
  and the improper payment of bonuses by IWS. Morris also contends that the trial 
  judge erred in law in finding that Taylor Leibow did not owe him a fiduciary 
  duty. Lastly, Morris submits that the trial judge erred in holding that an undertaking 
  given by Morris after the litigation started foreclosed his claim against Taylor 
  Leibow. Taylor Leibow supports the holding of the trial judge and, in what it 
  refers to as a cross-appeal, advances arguments rejected by the trial judge, 
  which if successful would also lead to the dismissal of the action against Taylor 
  Leibow.</p>
<p>
  [26] The appeals were heard over thirteen days in April and May 2003. The number 
  and complexity of the grounds of appeal necessitated lengthy facta, multi-volume 
  compendia, and many volumes of legal authorities. The material filled the courtroom. 
  In the course of oral argument, which extended over some sixty hours, counsel 
  made extensive reference to this material and filed substantial additional written 
  material. The industry, forensic skills and civility of counsel throughout the 
  appellate process were greatly appreciated by the court. Like the trial judge, 
  we commend counsel for reflecting the finest tradition of the bar, in what for 
  their clients is a very bitter dispute.</p>
<p>
  III</p>
<p>
  THE EVIDENCE: AN OVERVIEW</p>
<p> <a name="27"></a>[27] The evidence at trial was extensive, detailed and contentious. 
  Counsel left no evidentiary stone unturned and no forensic blow unstruck. The 
  evidence ranged over the entire lives of Morris and Chester, but concentrated 
  on the events between the mid-1970s and the late 1980s. It included not only 
  detailed evidence from those involved in the events, but also copious and complex 
  expert evidence. Some of the specific events, standing alone, would have led 
  to a relatively complex commercial trial. </p>
<p>
  [28] The trial judge had a daunting task. She had to resolve a myriad of difficult 
  factual and legal questions. In the main, the evidence presented dramatically 
  opposed versions of the key events. The trial judge had to make critical credibility 
  assessments, which often left her with no realistic choice but to choose one 
  of the two versions of events placed before her. Whatever may be said about 
  the correctness of the trial judge's conclusions, her reasons, which extend 
  over 2,618 paragraphs, are a model of organization, thoroughness, and clarity. 
  They provide a detailed examination of virtually every issue raised at trial, 
  fully inform the parties about why she decided the issues the way she did, and 
  afford the dissatisfied parties with a full and complete opportunity to challenge 
  the result on appeal. The trial judge's reasons also provided valuable assistance 
  to this court in gaining an understanding of this factually and legally complex 
  litigation.</p>
<p>
  [29] Many of the grounds of appeal challenged findings of fact, thereby requiring 
  a close review of the evidence. Others, which raise legal issues, also require 
  a clear understanding of the factual substrata underlying those issues. To facilitate 
  our review of the evidence, we begin with a brief description of the principal 
  individuals, corporate entities, and properties referred to repeatedly in the 
  evidence. </p>
<p> <strong>The Waxmans</strong></p>

  Michael Waxman: The older son of Morris, born in 1956. After obtaining an MBA 
  in 1981, he wanted to become involved in the business of IWS. Morris also wanted 
  Michael to be involved. Michael operated SWRI with his father after 1982. He 
  is the prime mover on Morris's side of the litigation and is despised by Chester 
  and Robert, who blame him for many of the problems that developed between the 
  families.</p>

  at IWS in 1975 or 1976. Soon he was running the non-ferrous division of IWS. 
  In Morris's eyes, Robert took over many of the functions that he had previously 
  performed. Robert also controlled various corporate entities that supplied trucking 
  services to IWS between 1978 and 1984. Chester and Robert are the prime movers 
  on Chester's side of the litigation. </p>
<p>

<p>
  I. Waxman and Sons Ltd. ("IWS"): Initially an unincorporated proprietorship. 
  Incorporated in 1956. As of December 1983, Chester and Morris each held half

  and sold metal scrap other than iron, especially copper; and the refuse division, 
  which collected and disposed of garbage. The ferrous and refuse divisions were 
  sold in 1981. </p>
<p>
  Solid Waste Reclamation Inc. ("SWRI"): Originally incorporated when 
  IWS attempted unsuccessfully to obtain the Hamilton-Wentworth garbage contract. 
  It remained inoperative until 1982. Operated in the refuse business by Michael 
  and Morris between 1982 and 1989.</p>
<p>
  Lasco: Owned a steel mill that smelted scrap steel. In September 1981, it purchased 
  the assets of the IWS ferrous division and thereafter operated the division 
  as a joint venture with IWS. </p>

  Greycliffe grossly overcharged IWS for its services.</p>
<p>
  Icarus Leasing Inc., Robix Financial Corp., Big Rig Trucking Services Ltd., 
  Servetross: Related companies under the control of Robert and also involved 
  in providing trucking and other services to IWS.</p>

  all of its assets to Waxman Resources in exchange for shares in that company.</p>
<p>
  Philip Environmental Inc. ("Philip"): Controlled by Allen Fracassi 
  and his brother operated as a joint venture/subcontractor with SWRI in the refuse 
  business from 1982 until 1989. In September 1993, Philip purchased the shares 
  of Waxman Resources for $12 million plus shares in Philip. By 1997, Waxman Resources 
  had sold the Philip shares for $18.4 million.</p>
<p> <strong>Properties</strong></p>
<p>
  Windermere Road: A property located near Stelco and Dofasco purchased in two 
  separate transactions in the 1950s and put in the names of Morris and Chester. 
  Property was transferred to Morriston and Chesterton in 1963. IWS conducted 
  its business from this property and Morris had an office there until he was 
  fired in 1988. In 1981 when IWS sold its ferrous division, it leased part of 
  Windermere Road to IWS Ferrous. A building referred to as the "Blue Building" 
  and surrounding lands, which were used for the non-ferrous operations, were 
  not included in the lease to IWS Ferrous.</p>
<p>
  80 Glow Avenue: A property bought by Chester and Morris personally in 1972. 
  The IWS maintenance department was located on this property and it was the operational 
  base for the refuse division of IWS. After September 1981, IWS Ferrous leased 
  this property.</p>
<p>
  500 Centennial Parkway: This property consisted of 13 acres purchased in 1980, 
  referred to as the "Front 13 Acres", and 7.7 acres purchased in 1981, 
  referred to as the "Back 7.7 Acres". Title in the Front 13 Acres was 
  initially held by IWS. The IWS non-ferrous division operated out of the Front 
  13 Acres as did SWRI after 1982. Robert and Michael had offices at this location. 
  Title to the Back 7.7 Acres was held in trust for Morriston and Chesterton. 
  </p>
<p>
  Ancaster property: Property located in Ancaster, Ontario and purchased in 1956. 
  Morris transferred the property to Warren Waxman for $1 in 1986. According to 
  Morris, Chester promised to "straighten out" the share transfer if 
  Morris gave the Ancaster property to Warren so that he could build a home on 
  it.</p>
<p>
  IV</p>
<p>
  THE NARRATIVE OF THE IWS CLAIMS</p>
<p> <a name="30"></a>[30] For our purposes, we divide the story underlying the 
  IWS claims into eight chapters: </p>
<p class="indent5"> A. the IWS operation up to 1979;</p>
<p class="indent5">B. the proposed estate freeze;</p>
<p class="indent5">C. the 1979 bonuses;</p>
<p class="indent5">D. the sale of the IWS ferrous and refuse divisions in 1981;</p>
<p class="indent5">E. the 1981-82 bonuses;</p>
<p class="indent5">F. the Greycliffe trucking operation (1978-84);</p>
<p class="indent5">G. the share sale and related lease in December 1983; and</p>
<p class="indent5">H. the descent into litigation (1984-93).</p>
<p>
  [31] Parts of all of these chapters will be revisited when we address various 
  grounds of appeal arising out of separate episodes. At this stage of our reasons, 
  we provide an outline of the relevant evidence, a description of the competing 
  positions of the parties, and a summary of the trial judge's findings of fact. 
  </p>
<p>
  A. The IWS Operation up to 1979</p>
<p> <a name="32"></a>[32] Morris and Chester went to work for their father in 
  the mid-1940s. By the mid-1960s, IWS had a thriving scrap metal and refuse business 
  servicing major clients such as Stelco. Several family members were employed 
  in the business. </p>
<p>
  [33] Chester looked after the financial and legal affairs of IWS and also excelled 
  at getting and keeping scrap metal accounts. Morris was in charge of the operations 
  in the yard and was responsible for the purchase, repair and maintenance of 
  equipment, trucking arrangements, and supervising employees working in the yard. 
  Chester got the contracts and Morris made sure that IWS could fill them. </p>
<p>
  [34] According to Sam Taylor and others, Chester and Morris had absolute trust 
  in each other. One never second-guessed a decision made by the other in his 
  area of expertise. The two brothers never argued publicly. If Chester told Morris 
  that a certain transaction was necessary for the financial well-being of IWS, 
  Morris accepted that representation without question. Similarly, if Morris told 
  Chester that IWS needed a particular piece of equipment, Chester accepted that 
  representation without question. Morris's wife Shirley described their relationship 
  as like "two coats of paint on a wall".</p>
<p>
  [35] Chester and Morris received relatively small salaries, but also drew funds 
  from IWS on an as needed basis. If one of the brothers needed money to cover 
  an extraordinary expense, such as the purchase of a home, he drew it from IWS. 
  Neither brother attempted to control or monitor the drawings of the other. At 
  the end of the year, the drawings were calculated and the accountants attempted 
  to describe these drawings in a manner which would minimize taxes for the brothers, 
  while still passing muster with Revenue Canada.</p>
<p>
  [36] Morris and Chester did not separate their personal business affairs from 
  the business affairs of IWS. Taylor Leibow and IWS accounting personnel looked 
  after the personal investments and bank accounts of Morris and Chester. They 
  took instructions from Chester for both brothers' investments. The brothers' 
  income tax was calculated and paid by IWS personnel. The amount of tax paid 
  was added to each brother's drawings from the company. </p>
<p>
  [37] In 1968, on Chester's instructions, both brothers, Morris and Chester, 
  prepared identical wills. The wills provided that IWS would continue as a family 
  business with each side of the family owning half of the shares for at least 
  twenty years after the brothers died.</p>
<p>
  [38] By 1969, Isaac was no longer physically able to act as president. Morris 
  became president of IWS and Chester became vice-president. Their relationship 
  did not change. As president of IWS, Morris was required to sign many corporate 
  minutes and other documents. According to him, if documents were presented to 
  him by Chester or by the IWS lawyers or accountants for his signature, Morris 
  would not read the documents, but would simply sign them. Morris trusted that 
  Chester would never ask him to sign something that was to his detriment. </p>
<p>
  [39] Warren began to work full-time in 1974 and by the end of 1977 all three 
  of Chester's sons were working full-time as salesmen. The mid-1970s were not 
  prosperous years for IWS because of a recession in the steel industry, but by 
  1978, IWS began to rebound financially. Chester attributed this rebound to his 
  and his sons' efforts and abilities. The trial judge concluded that the revival 
  of the steel industry played a significant role in IWS's financial recovery. 
  </p>
<p>
  [40] At the same time that Chester's sons were becoming active in the affairs 
  of IWS, Morris was heavily involved in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to 
  obtain a very large garbage contract with Hamilton-Wentworth. SWRI was incorporated 
  in anticipation of obtaining the contract. Between 1975 and 1977, Morris spent 
  a great deal of time attempting to secure this contract and consequently spent 
  less time working in the yard at IWS. </p>
<p>
  [41] Within about a year of Robert going to work full-time for IWS, he decided 
  that he wanted to develop the non-ferrous division. Chester supported this initiative, 
  which included installation of a very expensive copper chopping line in the 
  Blue Building on Windermere Road. Although Morris had traditionally made decisions 
  about the purchase of new equipment, he was not consulted by Chester before 
  IWS proceeded to install the copper chopping equipment. The decision was made 
  by Chester and Robert.</p>
<p>
  [42] With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the relationship between 
  Morris and Chester began to change in the mid-1970s when Chester's sons came 
  into the business on a full-time basis. </p>
<p>
  [43] Linton came to work for IWS in August 1979. He took his instructions on 
  financial matters from Chester and seldom, if ever, consulted Morris. This was 
  consistent with the division of authority that had developed over the years 
  at IWS. </p>
<p>
  [44] By 1979, IWS had emerged from the financial slump of the mid-1970s. Revenues 
  had returned to the levels of the early seventies. All three of Chester's sons 
  were hard at work for IWS. Neither of Morris's sons worked for the company. 
  Morris had removed himself somewhat from the day-to-day activities of IWS while 
  he pursued the garbage contract with Hamilton-Wentworth. At the same time, Chester's 
  sons, and particularly Robert, were assuming supervisory roles that had previously 
  fallen to Morris. The long-running tandem of Chester and Morris was being replaced 
  by one consisting of Chester and his sons. </p>
<p>
  B. The Estate Freeze</p>
<p> <a name="45"></a>[45] In the mid-1970s, Morris and Chester were advised by 
  their financial advisers that they should structure an estate freeze as a means 
  of deferring tax on the increase in the value of IWS shares. There were many 
  discussions concerning the estate freeze in the late 1970s and further discussions 
  in early 1982. The estate freeze never came to pass and is not the subject of 
  a discrete claim by Morris. Morris, however, relies on the evidence concerning 
  the estate freeze to demonstrate Chester's ascendancy in financial matters, 
  the changing nature of their relationship in the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
  and their very different views about how the ownership of IWS should be divided 
  among their five sons. </p>
<p>
  [46] In the late 1970s, there were several discussions concerning the proposed 
  estate freeze among Morris, Chester, Taylor, Ennis and Arthur Scace, a tax expert. 
  Scace recommended that a formal valuation of IWS be prepared with a view to 
  obtaining an advance tax ruling on the proposed estate freeze. Ian Campbell 
  prepared two valuations of IWS. He valued the company at between $7 and $8.5 
  million as of December 31, 1978 and between $8.5 and $10 million as of December 
  31, 1979.</p>
<p>
  [47] Chester wanted to structure the estate freeze so that sixty per cent of 
  the common shares would go to his three sons and forty per cent would go to 
  Morris's two sons. Morris was opposed to this division and said that he made 
  it clear to Chester in their private discussions that any division of the shares 
  should be on a 50-50 basis between the two families. In keeping with their practice 
  they did not argue publicly about their differences.</p>
<p>
  [48] An advance ruling from Revenue Canada was obtained, as suggested by Scace. 
  The material filed with Revenue Canada indicated that Chester's sons would hold 
  sixty per cent of the common shares and Morris's sons would hold forty per cent. 
  The trial judge found that Morris was not aware of the details of the proposal 
  sent to Revenue Canada on Chester's instructions. The trial judge also found 
  at para. 134 that under the voting trust arrangements described in the material 
  sent to Revenue Canada, "Chester would have had effective control of IWS". 
  Counsel for Chester took issue with that finding, arguing that on the proposal 
  Chester and Morris would have had joint control over eighty per cent of the 
  voting shares during their lives. Counsel argued that even if Chester had exclusive 
  control over the other twenty per cent of the common shares, he would not have 
  control over IWS. Apart entirely from the question of immediate control, the 
  proposal sent to Revenue Canada would certainly have put Chester's sons in control 
  of IWS after Chester and Morris died. </p>
<p>
  [49] Chester testified that in order to secure his brother's agreement to a 
  60-40 split in the estate freeze, Chester had agreed to transfer a single share 
  held in the name of Isaac back to Morris in 1979. According to Chester, the 
  share had been held by Isaac so that Chester would have one more share than 
  Morris and would have the ability to control the affairs of IWS. Chester testified 
  that his father had wanted him to have control of IWS in the future. </p>
<p>
  [50] The trial judge rejected Chester's evidence concerning the single share. 
  The corporate records showed that the share had been transferred back to Isaac 
  by Morris so that Isaac could qualify to be a director of the corporation, and 
  that Isaac held the share in trust for Morris. The share was transferred back 
  to Morris after Isaac died. According to Taylor, the share had always been beneficially 
  owned by Morris. The trial judge also rejected Chester's evidence that Isaac 
  had wanted Chester to control the company. Chester's evidence was contradicted 
  by the terms of Isaac's will. </p>
<p>
  [51] The trial judge also found that Morris had told Chester in their private 
  conversation that any division of IWS shares as part of an estate freeze must 
  be on a 50-50 basis. The trial judge further found that Chester ignored Morris's 
  wishes when he directed that a proposal based on a 60-40 split of the shares 
  should be sent to Revenue Canada for advance approval. The trial judge concluded 
  that Chester's conduct in relation to the estate freeze reflected his changed 
  attitude towards Morris and ownership of IWS. In his will, written in 1968, 
  Chester had anticipated that IWS would be owned 50-50 by each side of the family 
  for at least twenty years. By 1978, Chester saw his family as entitled to a 
  sixty per cent interest in IWS. Lastly, the trial judge held, relying on Chester's 
  own evidence, that Chester was using the estate freeze to gain control of IWS. 
  According to Chester's evidence, there was no longer a need for an estate freeze 
  when Morris decided to sell his shares to Chester. </p>
<p>
  [52] In February 1982, there were further discussions among Chester, Ennis and 
  Scace concerning the estate freeze. These discussions tie into the declaration 
  of the 1982 bonuses to be discussed below. The estate freeze contemplated in 
  February 1982 also involved a 60-40 split of the common voting shares. Morris 
  was unaware of these discussions.</p>
<p>
  C. 1979 Bonuses to Chester's Sons</p>
<p> <a name="53"></a>[53] Morris alleged that bonuses totalling $250,000 allocated 
  to Chester's sons for the year 1979, represented payment of shareholders' equity 
  to non-shareholders. He contended that he was unaware of and did not agree to 
  those payments and that as a fifty per cent shareholder was entitled to the 
  return of $125,000 representing fifty per cent of the bonus payment.</p>
<p>
  [54] In 1979, IWS revenues increased to $34.9 million from $25.2 million. Chester's 
  three sons were actively involved in the company and, according to Chester, 
  largely responsible for the increased revenues. As noted above, a strong financial 
  recovery by the steel industry contributed significantly to IWS's increased 
  revenues.</p>
<p>
  [55] In late 1979 or early 1980, Linton advised Chester that IWS would show 
  substantial profits in 1979 and that the taxable income of IWS could be reduced 
  by the payment of bonuses. Linton dealt only with Chester in relation to the 
  bonuses and took his instructions from Chester. Linton in turn instructed Ennis 
  to prepare certain corporate minutes to reflect the allocation and payment of 
  the bonuses ordered by Chester. </p>
<p>
  [56] Linton testified that initially he discussed a bonus of $100,000 with Chester, 
  but later the amount was increased to $250,000. Initially, Chester told Linton 
  to allocate $75,000 of the bonus to Chester, $75,000 to Morris, and the remaining 
  $100,000 to his sons. Chester said that he would discuss the allocation with 
  Morris. Linton testified that shortly afterwards Chester told him that Morris 
  and he had decided that the entire $250,000 should go to the sons. Linton then 
  told Ennis to prepare a minute declaring bonus payments totalling $250,000 to 
  Chester's sons. That minute, dated December 17, 1979 and signed by Morris, indicates 
  that the bonuses were approved in April 1980. </p>
<p>
  [57] Chester testified that in late 1979 or early 1980, he and Morris discussed 
  the payment of bonuses to Chester's sons in recognition of their contributions 
  to IWS. Chester said that he and Morris agreed that bonuses totalling $250,000 
  would be paid to Chester's sons. </p>
<p>
  [58] Morris testified that he had no discussions with anybody about the 1979 
  bonuses and was unaware of them until about 1998 when he learned of their existence 
  in the course of this litigation. He acknowledged his signature on the minute, 
  but testified that he signed IWS corporate documents when told to do so by Chester, 
  Linton or Ennis. He had no knowledge of the minute allocating the $250,000 to 
  the sons and would not have knowingly agreed to the payment since, in his view, 
  this amount was part of the equity of the company, half of which belonged to 
  him and, eventually, to his sons. </p>
<p>
  [59] The trial judge did not accept Chester's testimony about the 1979 bonuses. 
  She reached that determination based on documents from the files of Linton and 
  Ennis that were contemporaneous with the events in issue. Based on those documents, 
  she concluded that Chester had initially planned to allocate $75,000 to himself, 
  $75,000 to Morris and $100,000 to his sons. In April 1981, when the bonuses 
  were actually paid, Chester unilaterally decided to give the entire bonus to 
  his sons. He instructed Linton to redo the corporate records to reflect the 
  allocation of the entire $250,000 to his sons. Linton then wrote to Ennis indicating: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I enclose necessary adjustments to minutes of December 17, 1979 changing allocation 
  of bonuses. I will obtain Taylor Leibow's copy of minutes and destroy. Could 
  you forward to me revised copy so that I may deliver same to Taylor Leibow for 
  their audit files.</p>
<p>
  D. The Sale of the Ferrous and Refuse Divisions</p>
<p> <a name="60"></a>[60] In June 1981, IWS sold its refuse division to Laidlaw/Superior 
  for a total of $1.6 million. Three months later, in September 1981, IWS sold 
  its ferrous division and related equipment to Lasco for approximately $8.7 million. 
  Neither transaction is challenged in this litigation. Both transactions are, 
  however, closely connected to the 1981-82 bonuses and the share sale in December 
  1983.</p>
<p>
  [61] Morris was primarily responsible for the operation of the refuse division. 
  He had no interest in selling that division, but was told by Chester that IWS 
  needed an infusion of cash and that the sale of the refuse division could provide 
  the needed cash. Morris accepted Chester's assessment because this was the kind 
  of financial decision that fell within Chester's area of expertise. </p>
<p>
  [62] Chester told a different story. He said that he did not want to sell the 
  refuse division, but did so only because Morris expressed little interest in 
  keeping it and Chester knew that Michael would not do the hard work necessary 
  to make the refuse division prosperous. </p>
<p>
  [63] Chester began to negotiate with Laidlaw/Superior for the sale of the refuse 
  division in the summer of 1980. These negotiations were interrupted temporarily 
  while Chester negotiated with another company, but came to fruition in June 
  1981. Ennis testified that Chester had wanted to sell the refuse division throughout 
  the year-long negotiations.</p>
<p>
  [64] The sale to Laidlaw/Superior included IWS goodwill and customers list. 
  The sale excluded certain hazardous waste accounts and other specialty refuse 
  accounts, and allowed IWS to continue to service the refuse needs of its scrap 
  metal customers. Morris, Chester, his sons and IWS also entered into non-competition 
  clauses with Laidlaw. The remnants of the refuse division eventually fell under 
  the auspices of SWRI, which was run by Morris and Michael until 1989.</p>
<p>
  [65] The trial judge did not believe Chester's evidence concerning the sale 
  of the refuse division to Laidlaw/Superior. Chester's explanation changed in 
  the course of his evidence when certain documents were produced to him for the 
  first time. The trial judge found that Chester initiated the sale of the refuse 
  division, which was of little interest to him. He was much more interested in 
  developing the scrap metal business in which his three sons were heavily involved 
  by 1980. The trial judge further concluded that in deciding to sell the refuse 
  division, Chester showed little concern for Morris's interests and saw no future 
  role for Michael in the IWS operation.</p>
<p> [66] In late 1980, Chester began to negotiate the possible sale of the ferrous 
  division to Lasco. Lasco operated a steel mill and was a competitor of IWS in 
  the ferrous scrap business. The transaction, which eventually closed in September 
  1981, included the following terms: </p>
<ul>
  <li>IWS sold its ferrous division assets to IWS Ferrous, a joint venture company 
    owned equally by IWS and Lasco, for $6,410,000;</li>
  <li>IWS sold a guillotine shearing machine to Lasco for $2,321,984.15;</li>
  <li>IWS Ferrous entered into employment contracts with Chester, his three sons 
    and Sheldon Kumer, but not with Morris;</li>
  <li>IWS Ferrous leased the Glow Avenue property and the Windermere Road property 
    (excluding the Blue Building and surrounding lands). The lease was a twenty 
    year lease with rent at $19,000 per month, with increases in rent every five 
    years tied to the consumer price index. Rents were payable to Morriston and 
    Chesterton; </li>
  <li>IWS Ferrous was to pay IWS a tonnage fee of $4.00 for every ton of ferrous 
    material processed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [67] The shareholder agreement between Lasco and IWS Ferrous provided that either 
  could buy out the other's shares for a minimum of $4.5 million.</p>
<p>
  [68] The trial judge found that Morris was involved in the negotiations leading 
  to the transaction with Lasco. He was responsible for equipment valuations and 
  other operational matters. He played no role in any of the financial details. 
  She also held that no evidence was led explaining the reason for excluding Morris 
  from the employment contracts entered into with IWS Ferrous. He had considerable 
  expertise in operational matters relating to the ferrous division. She also 
  concluded at para. 216 that the rents payable by IWS Ferrous to Morriston and 
  Chesterton were "on the high side", but were within the range of what 
  would be considered commercially acceptable. </p>
<p>
  [69] After the Laidlaw/Superior and Lasco transactions, the business of IWS 
  changed. By the fall of 1981, IWS had three sources of income. It continued 
  to operate a non-ferrous division, received tonnage fees from IWS Ferrous (anticipated 
  to be about $2 million a year), and operated a small refuse division.</p>
<p>
  [70] After the sale to Lasco, IWS moved from the Windermere Road property to 
  offices at the Centennial Parkway property, which had been purchased in 1980. 
  IWS Ferrous continued to operate out of Windermere Road. Although Morris was 
  still the president of IWS, he stayed at the Windermere Road property. Morris 
  had very little to do with the day-to-day operation of the non-ferrous division, 
  which quickly fell under Robert's control. Linton, who did move to the Centennial 
  Parkway property, said that he had little day-to-day contact with Morris after 
  the move and reported to Robert on matters involving the business of the non-ferrous 
  division. An organizational chart prepared by Taylor Leibow in 1982 was consistent 
  with Linton's testimony. Morris was shown as having little day-to-day responsibility 
  for the IWS operations. </p>
<p>
  [71] As Morris's role in IWS diminished in late 1981 and the roles of Chester's 
  sons, especially Robert, increased at the same time, Michael, who was completing 
  his MBA, was hoping to become involved in IWS. Michael's abilities and interests 
  lay in financial matters, an area that had always been under the exclusive control 
  of Chester. As far as Morris was concerned, Michael was not given an opportunity 
  to become involved in the day-to-day operations of IWS. From Chester's point 
  of view, Michael was given the same opportunity as Chester's sons, but was not 
  prepared to work hard enough to take advantage of that opportunity.</p>
<p>
  [72] Chester made it clear in his evidence that he had no use for Michael. He 
  said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Michael was the problem. Not me, not my sons. Michael. If he wanted to come 
  in, he would have been welcomed in but if he expected to be pampered like he 
  probably was at home, he wasn't going to get it from me or my three sons. It's 
  a place to work and make money. </p>
<p>
  [73] Later in his evidence after describing Michael as "arrogant", 
  Chester said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [H]e personifies baleful or malignant passion. I don't know why but that's what 
  he's made of. I don't believe my brother made a pact with him. I think Michael 
  dominates him. </p>
<p>
  [74] Robert and Michael disliked each other intensely.</p>
<p>
  [75] IWS was financially strong as of late 1981. However, on the trial judge's 
  findings, it had ceased to operate as an informal 50-50 partnership between 
  Morris and Chester. </p>
<p>
  E. The 1981-82 Bonuses</p>
<p> <a name="76"></a>[76] In the fall of 1981, IWS had some $6.6 million in income 
  as a result of the Laidlaw/Superior and Lasco transactions. By February 1982, 
  IWS had declared bonuses totalling $6.6 million for 1981 and 1982. Of that amount, 
  $4.7 million was payable to Chester and his sons, $1.4 million was payable to 
  Morris, $500,000 was payable to Sheldon Kumer and Harry Leibowitz, another in-law 
  employed by IWS. Nothing was payable to Morris's sons.</p>
<p>
  [77] Chester testified that Lasco demanded non-competition agreements from Chester 
  and his three sons as a condition to entering into the transaction with IWS. 
  Chester's sons insisted that they should be compensated for agreeing not to 
  compete with Lasco. Chester thought that his boys should be compensated since 
  their efforts were largely responsible for IWS's prosperity and Lasco's interest 
  in purchasing its ferrous division. As far as Chester was concerned, by the 
  fall of 1981, he and his sons were the driving force behind IWS. </p>
<p>
  [78] Chester testified that before the closing of the Lasco transaction in September 
  1981, he and Morris had agreed that bonuses should be paid to Chester's sons 
  and to Sheldon Kumer and to Harry Liebovitz. Kumer and Liebovitz were married 
  to sisters of Morris and Chester and were long-time employees of IWS. Chester 
  further testified that he and Morris agreed on the specific amount that each 
  of Chester's sons would receive. They agreed that Robert would receive a total 
  bonus of $1.2 million, Warren $1.1 million, and Gary $1 million.</p>
<p>
  [79] The evidence of Chester's sons was consistent with that given by Chester. 
  Kumer, who was employed by Chester at the time of the trial, also testified 
  that he was told before the Lasco deal closed that he would be receiving a bonus 
  of $400,000. </p>
<p>
  [80] Morris testified that in October or November 1981, he attended a meeting 
  at the offices on Centennial Parkway with Chester, Linton, and two of Chester's 
  sons. Chester told Linton that the bonuses would be declared in favour of Morris, 
  Chester, Chester's sons and two of the brothers-in-law who worked at IWS. The 
  bonuses totalled about $500,000. Although Morris disagreed strongly with what 
  Chester was saying, he followed his usual practice and did not challenge Chester 
  in front of others. After the meeting was over, Morris told Chester that as 
  far as he was concerned, he and Chester were 50-50 partners and that if Chester 
  wanted to give bonuses to his sons, the bonuses would have to come out of his 
  fifty per cent. After his private conversation with Chester, Morris understood 
  that any bonuses that would be declared would be declared in equal amounts to 
  Chester and Morris. They could do whatever they wished with their money.</p>
<p>
  [81] Linton's evidence concerning the genesis of the decision to pay the 1981-82 
  bonuses differed from Chester's. He testified that the idea of bonuses originated 
  with him as a means of reducing or deferring the taxes that IWS would owe on 
  the substantial profits it made in the Laidlaw/Superior and Lasco transactions. 
  Linton testified that bonuses were first discussed in October or November 1981, 
  well after the Lasco transaction had closed. Up until this time Chester had 
  made no reference to payments to his sons as compensation for the non-competition 
  agreements. As of the middle of November 1981, the bonuses were still under 
  discussion. In these discussions, the bonuses were viewed as part of IWS's financial 
  strategy and not as compensation for Chester's sons agreeing to sign non-competition 
  agreements.</p>
<p>
  [82] Linton's working papers show that in November or December 1981, Chester 
  instructed Linton to have Ennis prepare corporate minutes declaring bonuses 
  for 1981. Ennis's notes set out the bonuses in the following amounts: </p>
<p class="indent"> - Chester $500,000;<br>
  - Morris $500,000; <br>
  - Robert $250,000; <br>
  - Gary $250,000; <br>
  - Warren $250,000; <br>
  - Sheldon Kumer $200,00; and<br>
  - Harry Liebovitz $50,000. </p>
<p>
  [83] By early January, Chester had changed his instructions to Linton, who then 
  told Ennis to prepare minutes reflecting the following bonus payments for 1981: </p>
<p class="indent"> - Chester $700,000; <br>
  - Morris $700,000; <br>
  - Warren $550,000; <br>
  - Robert $600,000; <br>
  - Gary $500,000; <br>
  - Sheldon Kumer $200,000; and <br>
  - Harry Liebovitz $50,000.</p>
<p>
  [84] Ennis prepared a corporate minute dated December 23, 1981 reflecting the 
  revised amounts. The minute was signed by Morris and his wife Shirley. Morris 
  testified that he had no recollection of when or how he came to sign the minute 
  and that he would not have agreed to the bonuses referred to in the minute had 
  he been aware of them. There was no evidence as to how this minute came to be 
  signed.</p>
<p>
  [85] In early 1982, Chester and Linton had further discussions concerning the 
  bonuses. Chester told Linton that if Revenue Canada questioned the bonuses to 
  his sons, they could be justified as compensation for the non-competition agreements. 
  This was the first time that Chester connected the bonuses to the non-competition 
  agreements in discussions with Linton. Linton could see nothing to justify the 
  amounts of the bonuses declared in favour of Chester's sons. He indicated in 
  a memo to Chester that they would be "hard pressed" to justify those 
  bonuses either in the context of a valuation of IWS or a review by Revenue Canada. 
  Linton indicated that, had the bonuses been paid directly to Morris and Chester, 
  there would have been no problems with Revenue Canada, although bonuses of that 
  size may still have raised a problem for anyone trying to prepare an accurate 
  valuation of IWS. </p>
<p>
  [86] Despite a recession in the steel industry in 1982, the 1981 bonuses to 
  Chester's sons were paid in full during 1982. In fact, Warren received $40,000 
  more than had been allocated to him in the bonus minute of December 23, 1981. 
  </p>
<p>
  [87] Morris had been allocated a bonus of $700,000 for 1981. That bonus was 
  "paid" by reducing Morris's drawings account to zero when the amount 
  outstanding in that account combined with tax payable on that amount equalled 
  $700,000. Morris never received a bonus cheque or any other documentation that 
  referred to the 1981 bonus allocated to him. The treatment of Morris's drawings 
  account and the payment of his income tax was the same in 1981 as it was in 
  previous years. </p>
<p>
  [88] Neither Linton nor Ennis gave any evidence about discussing bonus payments 
  with Morris at any time before the execution of the December 23, 1981 minute. 
  Linton testified that he reviewed the 1981 financial statements with Morris 
  and that those statements revealed the 1981 bonuses. However, the only 1981 
  IWS financial statement with Morris's name on it referred to payments to directors 
  and senior officers of some $530,000. It did not refer, as did the final IWS 
  financial statement for 1981, to the payment of bonuses in the amount $3.3 million. 
  </p>
<p>
  [89] An IWS minute signed by Morris authorizing bonuses for 1982 in the same 
  amounts as the 1981 bonuses is dated February 22, 1982, only one month into 
  the 1982 corporate year. It is unusual for a bonus to be declared before the 
  end of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>
  [90] Morris acknowledged that he signed the 1982 bonus minute. He did not know 
  how or when he came to sign it and testified that he was unaware of the bonuses 
  until much later. He further testified that he would not have approved the bonuses 
  had he been aware of them. No other witness gave any evidence about how or when 
  the February 22, 1982 minute came to be signed. </p>
<p>
  [91] Chester's sons did not get most of their 1982 bonuses. They were reallocated 
  to Chester in 1985. Part of Morris's $700,000 1982 bonus was also reallocated 
  to Chester. Morris's drawings and the tax owing on those drawings totalled $288,000 
  at the end of 1983. That part of his $700,000 bonus was used to reduce the drawings 
  to zero and pay the tax owing. The remainder, $412,000, was reallocated to Chester. 
  According to IWS records and Linton, this happened at the end of 1983 and the 
  $412,000 became part of the purchase price paid by Chester to Morris for Morris's 
  shares. Chester testified that Morris had agreed to give up part of his 1982 
  bonus in February 1982 and that when Morris ceased to be a shareholder at the 
  end of 1983, he was no longer entitled to the remainder of the bonus. Bonuses 
  assigned to Kumer and other employees in 1982 were also reassigned to Chester.</p>
<p>
  [92] The trial judge found that Chester lied about the reasons for the 1981-82 
  bonuses. Relying on the evidence of Morris and Linton, Linton's working papers, 
  and Ennis's notes (produced for the first time after Chester had testified), 
  she concluded that the bonus payments had nothing to do with the non-competition 
  agreements and the Lasco transaction. Rather, Chester's attempt to connect the 
  two was an after-the-fact justification for the payment of huge bonuses to his 
  sons, all of whom were young and quite new to the business world. The trial 
  judge held that Chester decided to pay these bonuses well after the Lasco transaction 
  closed and that the actual amounts of the bonuses were in a state of flux until 
  early in 1982. The trial judge also found that Morris was not aware of the payment 
  of these bonuses to Chester's sons and would not have agreed to them had he 
  been made aware of them. </p>
<p>
  [93] The trial judge decided that the 1981 and 1982 bonuses were in fact a distribution 
  of IWS shareholders' equity, realized from the Laidlaw/Superior and Lasco transactions 
  and accumulated over the previous thirty years, to individuals who were not 
  shareholders. She further held that there was no valid business reason for allocating 
  millions of dollars in shareholders' equity to Chester's sons. The trial judge 
  held that Chester's unilateral decision to pay these bonuses to his sons reflected 
  Chester's view that by the end of 1981, neither Morris nor his sons were of 
  any significant value to IWS. She also determined that the eventual reallocation 
  of almost all of the 1982 bonuses to Chester demonstrated his control over the 
  financial affairs of IWS and further put the lie to his evidence that the bonuses 
  were compensation for the boys agreeing not to compete with Lasco.</p>
<p>
  [94] The trial judge concluded that the decision to declare the 1982 bonuses 
  in February 1982 was connected to the estate freeze discussions, which Chester 
  was then having with his tax advisers. By declaring the bonuses in February 
  1982, Chester hoped to lower the value of IWS for the purposes of the estate 
  freeze, while at the same time putting the company's equity into the hands of 
  the people he thought deserved it: himself and his sons. </p>
<p>
  F. The Greycliffe Trucking Operation</p>
<p> <a name="95"></a>[95] Morris claimed that between 1978 and early 1984, Greycliffe 
  and related companies controlled by Robert diverted funds from IWS, thereby 
  diminishing his equity in the company. Morris alleged that Robert caused IWS 
  to pay exorbitant trucking rates to Greycliffe and related companies and caused 
  IWS to pay trucking-related expenses that should properly have been paid by 
  Greycliffe. The Greycliffe allegations came down to three factual issues: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Did Morris know of and approve of the trucking arrangements made with Greycliffe 
    on behalf of IWS?</li>
  <li>Were the rates charged to IWS by Greycliffe exorbitant?</li>
  <li>Did IWS pay expenses relating to the trucking operation that should have 
    been paid by Greycliffe?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [96] The first factual issue turned largely on the trial judge's assessment 
  of the credibility of the various witnesses. The second required a consideration 
  of competing expert evidence. The third turned to a large extent on Robert's 
  credibility and the relevant documentary evidence. </p>
<p>
  [97] Up until the mid-1970s, IWS owned its own trucks and hired drivers. Morris 
  was responsible for this aspect of the IWS operation. In 1977, after experiencing 
  labour problems with its unionized drivers, IWS attempted to use brokers to 
  truck its product. These attempts were not successful. According to Robert and 
  Chester, Robert approached Chester and Morris and offered to provide reliable 
  trucking services for IWS at competitive rates using Greycliffe, a company he 
  owned with his brother Gary. Robert said that he saw this as a chance to solve 
  the IWS trucking problems, while at the same time earning extra income for himself. 
  Robert agreed that the trucking problems could equally have been solved by setting 
  up a subsidiary of IWS to perform trucking services. </p>
<p>
  [98] The Greycliffe operation started slowly. By 1981, Greycliffe was trucking 
  scrap iron to IWS customers in the United States. After the Laidlaw/Superior 
  and Lasco transactions closed in 1981, Greycliffe began trucking the IWS non-ferrous 
  product to its customers. By the fall of 1981, Robert was in charge of the day-to-day 
  operation of Greycliffe and the day-to-day operation of the non-ferrous division 
  of IWS. Robert effectively decided the rates that Greycliffe would demand and 
  whether those rates were agreeable to IWS. Between 1980 and 1983, Greycliffe's 
  business with IWS increased substantially. Its rates also increased by almost 
  fifty per cent. </p>
<p>
  [99] Chester, Robert, and Kumer all testified that Morris was aware that Robert 
  owned Greycliffe and that Greycliffe was hauling product for IWS. According 
  to them, Morris, who was in the Windermere Road yard every day as Greycliffe 
  trucks came and went, was heavily involved in trucking-related matters and regularly 
  attended at the informal late afternoon meetings where trucking matters were 
  often discussed. They also testified that Morris reviewed the rates charged 
  by Greycliffe, saw Greycliffe invoices, and signed cheques payable to Greycliffe 
  from IWS.</p>
<p>
  [100] Morris's evidence was very different. He said that he learned in late 
  1981 or 1982 that Greycliffe was doing some trucking for IWS. He had no knowledge 
  of the rates charged by Greycliffe and had nothing to do with approving those 
  rates. He did not see Greycliffe invoices and did not sign cheques payable to 
  Greycliffe. </p>
<p>
  [101] Chester and his sons had control of IWS and Greycliffe documents after 
  the litigation started. Chester did not produce any cheques to Greycliffe signed 
  by Morris or any invoices bearing Morris's writing. According to Gary, most 
  of the Greycliffe documents had been lost in a flood in the basement of the 
  Centennial Parkway property in 1989. In Gary's cross-examination, it became 
  clear that many documents that had been damaged in the flood were produced by 
  Chester in the course of the trial. The documents that had apparently survived 
  the flood, for example, certain SWRI documents, tended to help Chester's case. 
  According to Gary, the Greycliffe documents were damaged beyond repair. Chester 
  did not produce any of those documents to support his defence to the Greycliffe 
  allegations. The trial judge ultimately concluded at para. 1072 that Chester's 
  failure to produce various critical documents, including those said to have 
  been lost in the "selective" flood, "was not accidental, but 
  deliberate."</p>
<p>
  [102] Robert testified that, by agreement, Greycliffe charged IWS common carrier 
  rates. He produced one rate sheet, which post-dated the Lasco transaction. That 
  rate sheet showed common carrier rates for haulage by dump-style vehicles. Greycliffe 
  was not a common carrier and was hauling in vans, not dump-style vehicles. According 
  to the expert evidence, industry practice dictated that haulage by van and by 
  non-common carrier should be at much lower rates than those charged by common 
  carriers using dump-style vehicles.</p>
<p>
  [103] Although Robert insisted that there were many other rate sheets used by 
  Greycliffe, he was unable to produce any of them. He suggested that Revenue 
  Canada had been provided with the sheets in connection with a 1985 audit. Robert 
  acknowledged in cross-examination that he had made no attempts to recover any 
  of the documents from Revenue Canada.</p>
<p>
  [104] According to the expert evidence tendered by Morris, Greycliffe was charging 
  almost fifty cents per mile more than it should have for the service that it 
  was providing. According to that same evidence, Greycliffe was enjoying profit 
  margins of between forty-four and fifty-four per cent when normal profit margins 
  in the industry were less than five per cent. Morris's experts opined that the 
  profit margins enjoyed by Greycliffe could be achieved only through gross overcharging 
  and/or the payment of Greycliffe expenses by IWS. </p>
<p>
  [105] Chester attempted to counter the expert evidence called by Morris with 
  evidence from a trucker named Stockwell, who operated a trucking business similar 
  to Greycliffe's during the relevant time. In his evidence, Stockwell suggested 
  that his own levels of profitability were consistent with those enjoyed by Greycliffe. 
  Subsequent evidence showed that Stockwell grossly overstated the revenues generated 
  by his trucking operation. His own financial records indicated that far from 
  making the profits he suggested he had made, his operation had lost money in 
  1983.</p>
<p>
  [106] There was evidence from a Greycliffe truck driver that Greycliffe drivers 
  regularly fuelled up at the Windermere Road and Glow Avenue properties. Robert 
  testified that IWS charged the cost of that fuel to Greycliffe. IWS records 
  show some fuel set off charges up until September 1981. No set-off charges appear 
  after that date.</p>
<p>
  [107] In the course of the 1983 audit, the IWS auditors referred to an expense 
  of $25,000-$30,000 for "truck repairs", and indicated that those repairs 
  should be charged to Greycliffe. Robert testified that these repairs represented 
  the cost of replacing tires, and were properly charged to IWS because the damage 
  had occurred when the Greycliffe trucks went through the yard at the Windermere 
  Road property. </p>
<p>
  [108] It was common ground that Greycliffe did not have any insurance expenses. 
  It was insured under the IWS policy. According to Robert, this was the same 
  arrangement that had been made with the brokers who provided trucking services 
  prior to Greycliffe. </p>
<p>
  [109] Greycliffe had no employees other than Robert, his wife, and the truck 
  drivers. IWS employees regularly did administrative work for Greycliffe for 
  which IWS was not compensated. </p>
<p>
  [110] The IWS financial records showed that from time to time, petty cash advances 
  were made by IWS to Greycliffe. There was no evidence of any reimbursement.</p>
<p>
  [111] By February 1984, after Morris had purportedly sold his IWS shares and 
  IWS was owned entirely by Chester, Greycliffe stopped providing trucking services 
  for IWS. By then, Greycliffe had a racehorse inventory valued at $1.2 million. 
  This inventory was funded by the profits Greycliffe had made hauling product 
  for IWS. </p>
<p>
  [112] For its year ending May 31, 1981, Greycliffe had revenues of $459,000, 
  almost all of which came from providing services to IWS. Greycliffe and IWS 
  were reported as related parties in Greycliffe's financial statement. No such 
  notation appeared in the IWS financial statement for 1981. Steven Wiseman, who 
  prepared the financial statement, indicated that he did not regard the relationship 
  between Greycliffe and IWS as relevant to the users of the IWS financial statement. 
  He repudiated an earlier position in which he had said that it was a mistake 
  not to report Greycliffe as a related-party, and his evidence given on discovery 
  in which he had indicated that he was not aware of any related-party transactions 
  for the 1981 fiscal year. </p>
<p>
  [113] Wiseman testified at trial that he was not concerned about the competitiveness 
  of Greycliffe's rates, even though he knew Robert controlled Greycliffe and 
  also made trucking decisions on behalf of IWS. There was evidence, however, 
  that in early 1982, Wiseman discussed the rates being charged with Taylor who 
  in turn spoke to Chester. There was a concern that if Revenue Canada found the 
  Greycliffe expenses to be unreasonable, it would not allow IWS to deduct them 
  for tax purposes. </p>
<p>
  [114] Wiseman directed all his questions and concerns about Greycliffe and IWS 
  to Chester and/or Robert, not Morris.</p>
<p>
  [115] Greycliffe had revenues of $693,000 in 1982, most of which came from IWS. 
  In the course of preparing the 1982 financial statement, Linton told Wiseman 
  that Robert did not want payments to Greycliffe disclosed as related-party transactions 
  in the IWS financial statement, if disclosure could be avoided. Wiseman's working 
  papers reveal that he was made aware of Linton's request and that he was aware 
  of the very large payments made to Greycliffe. Wiseman's notes also indicate 
  that, by this time, Robert was signing all cheques. </p>
<p>
  [116] Wiseman met with Linton and Chester to discuss the request that Greycliffe's 
  transactions not appear as related-party transactions. According to Wiseman, 
  Linton said that he did not want to disclose those transactions as he did not 
  want to "wave a red flag" for the tax department. After the meeting, 
  Wiseman instructed his subordinates to remove the related-party note that had 
  appeared in the 1982 draft financial statement. A related-party note did appear 
  in the final version of the financial statement, but it made no reference to 
  Greycliffe. The 1982 financial statement was given to Robert.</p>
<p>
  [117] The trial judge found that Wiseman knew that Robert and Linton did not 
  want the Greycliffe related-party transactions disclosed on the IWS financial 
  statements. She further held that this had nothing to do with concerns about 
  attracting the attention of Revenue Canada since the transactions were revealed 
  as related transactions in Greycliffe's financial statement.</p>
<p>
  [118] The Greycliffe transactions were revealed as related-party transactions 
  in the IWS 1983 financial statement. This was prepared in 1984 after the purported 
  transfer of Morris's shares to Chester. </p>
<p>
  [119] The trial judge accepted Morris's evidence that he was not aware of any 
  of the details involving the arrangements between Greycliffe and IWS. Robert 
  made the arrangements. Morris was aware in late 1981 or early 1982 that Robert 
  and Gary owned Greycliffe and that Greycliffe was doing some trucking for IWS. 
  He did not know what rates were being charged and he was not involved in the 
  payment of Greycliffe's account. In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge 
  relied in part on the evidence of Warren, to the effect that he had no familiarity 
  with the operations of Greycliffe or the terms on which it carried IWS's product 
  even though he was in the Windermere Road yard on a regular basis. On the trial 
  judge's findings, at para. 425, Morris "received only snippets of information 
  about Robert's Companies". She found that Morris would not have agreed 
  to the arrangement between Greycliffe and IWS if he were aware of the details.</p>
<p>
  [120] The trial judge also determined that Greycliffe charged IWS rates well 
  above market rates, particularly after September 1981. She found that Greycliffe 
  was charging common carrier dump truck rates, although it was not a common carrier 
  and it was using van-style haulage. In her view, this two-fold overcharging 
  resulted in rates that were exorbitant, abut fifty cents per mile higher than 
  they should have been.</p>
<p>
  [121] The trial judge found that IWS was absorbing fuel expenses that should 
  have been borne by Greycliffe. In addition, IWS was paying for truck repairs 
  that were properly chargeable to Greycliffe, and absorbing insurance and administrative 
  costs that should have been charged back to Greycliffe. The trial judge summed 
  up her findings at para. 438: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I find that IWS could have provided its own trucking services. Greycliffe was 
  incorporated only because Robert wanted to make additional income for himself. 
  All Greycliffe profits could have been earned within IWS. Each of Robert's Companies 
  performed services that could have been performed by IWS or its subsidiaries, 
  and the profits therefrom could have been retained in IWS. Those profits came 
  right off IWS' bottom line, and deprived its shareholders of equity, which should 
  have remained in IWS. </p>
<p>
  G. The Share Sale and Related Lease in December 1983</p>
<p> <a name="122"></a>[122] Before 1982, Morris and Chester had two very brief 
  discussions about Morris selling his shares to Chester. The first occurred in 
  September 1981. Morris was angry about a confrontation between Michael and Robert, 
  and said to Chester that their sons could never work together. He suggested 
  that Chester buy his shares. The next day Morris told Chester to forget what 
  he had said in anger the day before. The second brief conversation occurred 
  in late 1981 when Chester brought up the possibility of Morris selling his shares 
  to Chester. Morris said he had no interest in selling his shares and asked Chester 
  not to raise the topic again. </p>
<p>
  [123] In 1982, a recession hit the steel industry and IWS fell into a business 
  slump along with the rest of the scrap metal business. According to Chester 
  and Linton, there were concerns about Lasco's survival. If Lasco did not survive, 
  IWS Ferrous would fail and IWS would lose a major source of income. Chester 
  testified that at a dinner in the summer of 1982 at the Trocadero Restaurant 
  in Hamilton, Morris said that he was no longer interested in an estate freeze, 
  but wanted Chester to buy his shares. Chester testified that he was upset at 
  this request and thought that Morris was trying to get out of the business when 
  times were difficult. Chester suggested to Morris that Morris should buy Chester's 
  shares. Morris declined, indicating that it would make sense for Chester and 
  his sons to continue in the business. Morris denied that this conversation took 
  place. He said that although business was not good in the summer of 1982, he 
  knew that IWS was financially sound and would rebound. He had no interest in 
  selling his shares. </p>
<p>
  [124] Chester testified that he was not immediately interested in buying Morris's 
  shares because of the difficult business conditions. He spoke to his sons who 
  told him that he should consider buying the shares if the price was right. Chester 
  testified that he had two or three discussions with Morris in the late summer 
  and early fall of 1982. Morris insisted on secrecy and, according to Chester, 
  did not want Taylor or Wiseman or anyone else to know about the possible share 
  sale. Morris's insistence on secrecy precluded going to any outside source, 
  such as Campbell, for a valuation of IWS. Chester indicated that Morris insisted 
  that only Linton be told of the possible sale. Chester saw no need for outside 
  consultation since in his view, "[w]e both had an identical interest in 
  the Share Sale."</p>
<p>
  [125] In November 1982, at Chester's request, Linton prepared a valuation of 
  IWS. He had never prepared a business valuation before. Linton had been told 
  that the estate freeze would not proceed and that Chester was considering buying 
  Morris out. Linton did not discuss the valuation with Morris and sent the valuation 
  only to Chester. Linton valued IWS on a break-up basis, even though he acknowledged 
  in his evidence that there was no possibility that IWS was going to be liquidated. 
  He valued fixed assets at cost, placed no value on the IWS interest in IWS Ferrous, 
  and concluded that because Morris did not contribute to the success of the non-ferrous 
  division, the value of that division should not be reflected in the value of 
  Morris's shares. Linton eventually concluded that as of October 31, 1982, IWS 
  had a value of between $3 and $3.5 million. In arriving at that amount, Linton 
  took into consideration the anticipated dividends in 1982 in the amount of $2,288,000, 
  half of which would go to Morris. According to these figures, Morris's fifty 
  per cent interest in IWS was worth between $2.6 and $2.85 million. </p>
<p>
  [126] Chester testified that he thought that Linton's valuation was low. However, 
  Chester gave a copy of Linton's valuation to Ennis in 1983 when Ennis was working 
  on the share sale. No other valuation was prepared in connection with the share 
  sale. Morris testified that he was never shown Linton's valuation. In his view, 
  the valuation was ludicrously low.</p>
<p>
  [127] The trial judge accepted Morris's evidence that the discussion at the 
  Trocadero did not occur. She also found that by 1982, Chester and his family 
  were not prepared to split IWS on a 50-50 basis with Morris and his family. 
  Instead, they were systematically "stripping IWS of much of its equity 
  and diverting it to [Chester's] side of the family" (para. 494). Next, 
  the trial judge found that despite the 1982 recession, IWS was financially sound. 
  She relied on the evidence of Wiseman in coming to this conclusion. The trial 
  judge also concluded that by the fall of 1982, an estate freeze was no longer 
  under discussion. Chester's focus had shifted to purchasing Morris's shares. 
  </p>
<p>
  [128] The trial judge considered Linton's valuation in some detail. She concluded 
  that it was written for Chester and to serve Chester's purpose, which was to 
  drive down the value of Morris's shares. In support of this conclusion, the 
  trial judge observed that although Linton approached his valuation on a break-up 
  basis, IWS was purchasing expensive new equipment and expanding its non-ferrous 
  operation.</p>
<p>
  [129] Ennis's diary indicates that he met with Chester and Robert to discuss 
  the sale of shares in February 1983. This was about one month after Chester 
  and Michael had a serious discussion about Michael's future in the company and 
  Michael's concern that Chester and his sons were not treating Morris properly. 
  Michael did not think that Chester wanted him working for IWS in 1983. </p>
<p>
  [130] Ennis denied that the meeting in February 1983 related to a potential 
  purchase of Morris's shares by Chester. He also denied having any discussion 
  about the sale with Chester in November 1982. Ennis testified that he was first 
  consulted about a possible share sale in April or May 1983 when he spoke to 
  Morris at their synagogue. Morris told him that he was going to sell his shares 
  to Chester and that he wanted Ennis to act for him. Ennis testified that he 
  told Morris that he could not act for Morris or Chester and could not give tax 
  or business advice. Morris assured him that he and Chester would work out all 
  of the details and the purchase price. They needed someone they could trust 
  to draw up a contract that would reflect their mutual wishes. Ennis said that 
  Morris told him that he and Chester had agreed that Chester would pay $3 million 
  for Morris's shares. </p>
<p>
  [131] Chester testified that he received a call from Ennis in May 1983, indicating 
  that Morris had asked Ennis to call Chester about the share sale. Chester said 
  that he and Morris then met with Ennis. Contrary to Ennis's evidence, Chester 
  testified that the purchase price was not agreed on until months later. Morris 
  denied discussing the share sale with Ennis at this time. </p>
<p>
  [132] Ennis testified that in the summer of 1983 he had discussions and meetings 
  concerning the share sale with both Morris and Chester. He eventually drafted 
  a share sale agreement in July 1983 showing a purchase price of $2.65 million 
  to be paid over several years. In addition, Morris would receive the $700,000 
  1982 bonus allocated in February 1982. The draft sale agreement was accompanied 
  by a draft lease whereby the Blue Building and the Back 7.7 Acres of Centennial 
  Parkway were to be leased to IWS by Chesterton and Morriston for $5,000 per 
  month. According to Chester, this was the rent that Morriston and Chesterton 
  had been receiving since February 1982 and took into account IWS's assumption 
  of all environmental risks as well as Chester's agreement to take responsibility 
  for the less fortunate members of the extended Waxman family. Ennis did not 
  discuss the draft agreement or lease with Morris.</p>
<p>
  [133] Ennis also prepared a document referred to as the "Lasco Covenant 
  Agreement", whereby Morris and Chester undertook to abide by the IWS Ferrous 
  shareholders' agreement and the Lasco management agreement. The agreement was 
  specifically said to be binding on Morris, Chester, and their heirs. Morris 
  was experiencing heart problems in the summer of 1983. Michael loomed as his 
  heir.</p>
<p>
  [134] The trial judge concluded that Chester and Ennis first discussed the share 
  sale in late 1982 and were actively discussing the potential share purchase 
  in the summer of 1983. Morris had no involvement in these discussions and was 
  not aware of them. The Lasco Covenant Agreement was drawn on Chester's instructions 
  exclusively for Chester's benefit in the event that something happened to Morris 
  before Chester could complete the purchase of Morris's shares. Morris signed 
  the Lasco Covenant Agreement at Chester's request, believing it had something 
  to do with the Lasco transaction. He did not read it.</p>
<p>
  [135] The trial judge rejected Ennis's evidence that his first discussion about 
  the sale of shares was with Morris at the synagogue. Relying on Ennis's own 
  records, the trial judge found that he had had at least two previous discussions 
  with Chester. The trial judge also accepted Morris's evidence that there was 
  no discussion about the sale of shares at the synagogue.</p>
<p>
  [136] The trial judge found that by early 1983, after Chester had his discussion 
  with Michael, Chester was even more concerned about Michael's potential involvement 
  in IWS. He knew that he would not be able to dominate Michael in financial matters 
  in the same way he had dominated Morris. </p>
<p>
  [137] As summer turned to fall in 1983, IWS's financial situation improved along 
  with the rest of the economy. According to Chester, he and Morris continued 
  to negotiate the share sale. Morris wanted to retain control of the refuse division, 
  to remain as president of IWS, and he wanted Michael, himself and Shirley to 
  remain on the IWS payroll. Chester said that he agreed to all of these stipulations. 
  Ennis continued to meet with Chester, but not with Morris. He said that he spoke 
  with Morris from time to time and inquired about the course of the negotiations 
  between Morris and Chester. </p>
<p>
  [138] Linton met with Chester four or five times in the fall of 1983 to discuss 
  the share sale. Morris was not there. Linton never spoke to Morris about the 
  share sale, although he saw him on a regular basis. </p>
<p>
  [139] Morris had a longstanding heart problem. In September 1983, his heart 
  specialist scheduled him for an angiogram. Morris fainted in October and was 
  hospitalized. His specialist advanced the scheduled angiogram and told Morris 
  that he might have to undergo open heart surgery. Morris met with his doctor 
  to discuss the risks inherent in the angiogram and open heart surgery. Michael, 
  Shirley, and a business associate all testified that Morris was not himself 
  in the last three months of 1983. Shirley described Morris as withdrawn, preoccupied, 
  frightened, and nervous. According to Morris's doctor, this was not unusual 
  for a person facing open heart surgery. Chester testified that Morris seemed 
  to be his same old self. </p>
<p>
  [140] Between late November and December 22, 1983 Chester had many meetings 
  with Ennis and Linton concerning the share sale. Ennis's notes indicate that 
  initially Chester wanted an option to purchase Morris's shares, but that on 
  about December 19, 1983 Chester decided to purchase the shares outright. Chester 
  had discussed various ways of financing the purchase with Ennis and Linton. 
  These included: reallocating part of Morris's 1982 bonus to Chester; IWS paying 
  a dividend to Chester and Morris; and Morris gifting part of the dividend back 
  to Chester. </p>
<p>
  [141] In these meetings, Chester and Ennis also discussed the IWS lease with 
  Morriston and Chesterton, which had first been discussed in the summer of 1983. 
  Chester instructed Ennis that the rent to be paid to Morriston and Chesterton 
  was to be $2,000 per month rather than the previously mentioned $5,000 per month. 
  Chester offered no explanation for this change. Morriston's proposed share of 
  the rent, $1,000 per month, was less than Morriston's carrying costs on the 
  mortgage on the property. Chester also instructed Ennis that various terms were 
  to be included in the lease. These terms effectively prevented Morriston from 
  doing anything with the property without Chesterton's approval. </p>
<p>
  [142] In his testimony, Morris said that he was completely unaware of Chester's 
  discussions with Ennis and Linton and played no role in any of them. He testified 
  that Chester mentioned the possible purchase of Morris's shares to him twice 
  in November 1983. Morris told Chester that he was not interested and later went 
  to see Chester and specifically asked him not to bring the topic up again. Morris, 
  who was not feeling well, felt that Chester was "trying to wear him down".</p>
<p>
  [143] Chester and Ennis testified that in anticipation of Chester buying Morris 
  out, Shirley's shares were transferred to Morris on December 8, 1983. Shirley 
  resigned as a director on the same day. Share certificates and a resignation 
  dated December 8, 1983 were in the IWS corporate records. Shirley had no recollection 
  of signing the documents and Morris had no recollection of signing a related 
  corporate minute. Ennis's notes indicate that these documents may actually have 
  been signed in May 1984. </p>
<p>
  [144] Chester testified that by about December 12, 1983, he and Morris had agreed 
  on a purchase price of $3 million. According to Chester, this was more than 
  Morris's shares were actually worth. But Morris was adamant that $3 million 
  should be the face value of the purchase price, even if he actually received 
  something less than $3 million and his tax liability significantly increased 
  because of the mode of payment. Chester testified that Morris never explained 
  his insistence on a stated purchase price of $3 million.</p>
<p>
  [145] Linton testified that by the middle of December, it was understood that 
  part of the purchase price would come from the reallocation of part of Morris's 
  1982 bonus to Chester. Ennis's notes also reflect this reallocation. Wiseman 
  testified that $412,000 of Morris's 1982 bonus was reallocated to Chester for 
  the purposes of the share sale. </p>
<p>
  [146] Linton testified that on Chester's instructions, he determined the amount 
  of Morris's drawings account at the end of 1983 and doubled it to take into 
  account taxation, yielding $288,000. Linton then drew the account down to zero 
  by attributing $288,000 to Morris. This amount was deducted from the $700,000 
  bonus attributed to Morris for 1982, leaving $412,000. The $412,000 was reallocated 
  to Chester and used to purchase Morris's shares. Linton said that the purchase 
  price of Morris's shares was increased from $2.65 million to $3 million to reflect 
  the use of these reallocated funds. </p>
<p>
  [147] Chester denied giving Linton any of these detailed instructions. He acknowledged 
  that $412,000 of Morris's 1982 bonus was reallocated to him, but insisted that 
  the reallocation was unconnected to the purchase of Morris's shares. Chester 
  said that it would be "immoral" to use the reallocated funds to purchase 
  Morris's shares. It was Chester's evidence that because Morris was no longer 
  a shareholder at the end of 1983, he was no longer entitled to the bonus. The 
  bonus was, therefore, properly reallocated to Chester. </p>
<p>
  [148] Although Ennis said that he had asked Morris from time to time about the 
  discussions with Chester, all of his lengthy meetings were with Chester, not 
  Morris. Ennis took all of his instructions from Chester and provided Chester 
  with all of the documents that he produced. In cross-examination Ennis said 
  that he saw no need to speak directly to Morris about the terms of any agreement 
  until Chester had decided exactly what he wanted to do and how he wanted to 
  do it. Ennis assumed that Chester was discussing matters with Morris and providing 
  Morris with copies of the various draft documents that Ennis prepared. Ennis 
  summarized his role in the following words: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am not negotiating this deal. I was only a scribe. I was to take instructions 
  and draw a document when they worked out their agreement. I never interfered. 
  I never insisted how they conduct themselves. They are experienced intelligent 
  people who have made millions of dollars and know exactly how to handle themselves. 
  They don't need me giving advice. They would not accept advice from me &#133; 
  they are people who give advice.</p>
<p> [149] The trial judge held that by December 19, 1983, Chester's discussions 
  with Ennis and Linton had crystallized to the point that he had decided to buy 
  Morris's shares. The details of the transaction were in a state of flux. The 
  trial judge rejected the evidence of Ennis and Chester and found that Morris 
  was not involved in or aware of any of the discussions pertaining to the share 
  sale. In coming to that conclusion, the trial judge referred to the absence 
  of any reference to Morris's involvement in notes prepared by Ennis or Linton. 
  The trial judge summarized her findings concerning the situation as of December 
  19th as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Chester wanted Morris's side of the family out of the business and had decided 
    to purchase Morris's shares. </li>
  <li>Chester wanted the transaction consummated quickly because of concerns about 
    Morris's health and Chester's desire to avoid having to deal with Michael.</li>
  <li>Chester did not want the IWS accountants, Taylor Leibow, or any outside 
    valuators, lawyers, or accountants to examine the specifics of the proposed 
    share sale. The only valuation that was prepared was done in November 1982 
    by Linton.</li>
  <li>Ennis was dealing only with Chester and Linton. He took his instructions 
    exclusively from Chester and did not discuss the share sale with Morris.</li>
  <li>Morris was oblivious to the ongoing share sale discussions and consequently 
    never sought any professional advice.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [150] Chester and Ennis testified that they met with Morris at Ennis's office 
  on December 20th and 22nd to complete the share sale documentation. According 
  to Chester and Ennis, both meetings were long and several documents relating 
  to the share sale and the related lease were discussed and signed at both meetings. 
  They testified that all of the pertinent documents were read out loud line by 
  line by Ennis's assistant, Ms. Butner. Ennis and Chester also testified that 
  Morris raised certain objections and questions in the course of the reading 
  of the documentation and that changes were made in response to some of his comments. 
  They testified that Morris raised questions about the amount of the initial 
  payment to him and the timing of that payment. As a result of these questions 
  Linton was told to revise the agreement. Chester also gave evidence that the 
  documentation could not be completed on December 20th because Morris insisted 
  that notice of the share sale be given to Lasco to avoid any possible problems 
  with the IWS Ferrous shareholders agreement. Consequently, the final version 
  of the share transfer agreement was not signed on December 20th, but was signed 
  at the second long meeting on December 22nd. Chester and Ennis testified that 
  the same oral line by line review of the documents occurred at the second meeting. 
  </p>
<p>
  [151] Morris denied that he ever attended a meeting where the share sale documentation 
  and the lease were explained or discussed, much less read out loud line by line. 
  He could recall attending one meeting, although he did not know the date, when 
  Chester told him to sign certain documentation that Chester referred to as "the 
  sale". According to Morris, Chester told him to look over the papers. Morris 
  assumed that the documents related to the day-to-day business of IWS and were 
  the kind of corporate documents he had routinely signed without reading when 
  asked to do so by Chester. Morris also recalled that when he was about to sign 
  one document, Chester said to Ennis, "this is to save your ass". Morris 
  did not know what Chester was referring to when he made the comment. One of 
  the documents signed by Morris was a waiver of independent legal advice.</p>
<p>
  [152] Morris testified that when he signed the documents he had complete trust 
  in Chester. He was also very concerned about his own health, particularly his 
  upcoming angiogram, which was scheduled for December 29th , 1983. </p>
<p>
  [153] The trial judge accepted Morris's evidence. She found at para. 726 that 
  the relevant documents were signed at one meeting and that they not were read 
  aloud, discussed, or explained in any way to Morris: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Morris did not understand at the time that the documents he was being asked 
  to sign were out of the ordinary. He thought he was signing IWS documents as 
  its President in the usual course. He signed the documents because Chester asked 
  him to do so and because he trusted Chester and Ennis. He did not want or intend 
  to sell his shares. He had no idea that he was selling his shares or signing 
  a lease.&#133;I do not accept that Morris was involved in any negotiations that 
  produced this deal [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [154] In rejecting the version of events offered by Chester and Ennis, the trial 
  judge relied on several factors. She noted that although Chester testified that 
  it was Morris who wanted Lasco advised of the transaction, it was in fact Chester 
  and Ennis who drove to Whitby, Ontario from Hamilton to personally speak to 
  the president of Lasco on December 21, 1983. At this meeting, Chester and Ennis 
  gave the president of Lasco a notification letter describing the pending share 
  sale. The trial judge found that this trip was made at Chester's insistence 
  and was consistent with Morris's testimony that he had no knowledge of the pending 
  sale. The letter Chester and Ennis provided to Lasco was also inconsistent with 
  the transaction having been completed by December 20th.</p>
<p>
  [155] The trial judge found, on the basis of the documentation, that the share 
  sale was not in its final form on December 20th and that many of the relevant 
  documents had not yet been prepared. The trial judge further concluded that 
  the evidence of Chester and Ennis that they along with Morris sat in a boardroom 
  for hours while Ms. Butner read the documents line by line did not have the 
  ring of truth. She observed that the documentation contained many errors, which 
  would have been spotted and corrected had the parties gone through the line 
  by line reading of the documents as described by Chester and Ennis. Finally, 
  the trial judge noted that in Chester's detailed statement of defence, he referred 
  to only one meeting, which he said occurred on December 22nd. </p>
<p>
  [156] Under the terms of the share sale, Morris sold his shares to Chester for 
  $3 million. One million dollars was payable on January 4, 1984, and the rest 
  was payable in installments over five years. IWS was to declare a 1983 dividend 
  of $1 million, $500,000 payable to each of Chester and Morris. Morris was then 
  to immediately gift his $500,000 dividend to Chester. Morris was to lend IWS 
  $500,000 repayable on October 8, 1984.</p>
<p>
  [157] Morris's shares were to be transferred to Chester in stages beginning 
  with a transfer of eighty-four shares in January 1984. There was a dispute over 
  whether the share sale was structured to provide for the transfer of title of 
  all of the shares to Chester upon the first payment or whether title was to 
  be transferred in stages over the payment term. </p>
<p>
  [158] In addition to the share sale, Morriston and Chesterton were to enter 
  into a fifty year lease with IWS, initially covering the front of Windermere 
  Road (including the Blue Building) and the Back 7.7 Acres of Centennial Parkway, 
  but eventually covering all of the Windermere Road and Centennial Parkway properties.</p>
<p>
  [159] It was Chester's evidence that in addition to the elements set out above, 
  the share sale required him to assume full responsibility for members of the 
  extended Waxman family who could not look after themselves and required IWS 
  to take full responsibility for any environmental problems that might develop 
  on the properties. IWS was also to continue to pay salaries and benefits to 
  Morris and Michael, who would operate the refuse division.</p>
<p>
  [160] After a detailed review of the evidence, including expert evidence, the 
  trial judge decided that virtually all aspects of the transactions described 
  above were grossly unfair to Morris. Based on the expert evidence that she accepted, 
  the trial judge concluded that as of December 31, 1983, IWS was conservatively 
  worth between $8.73 and $8.96 million. These figures did not include the $1 
  million dividend declared in 1983 or the $6.6 million in bonuses declared in 
  1981 and 1982. According to the expert evidence accepted by the trial judge, 
  a purchase price of $3 million was "not in the ballpark of reasonableness 
  or fairness".</p>
<p>
  [161] The trial judge further held that Morris did not actually receive $3 million. 
  She found that almost $1 million of the purchase price was Morris's own money 
  (the reassigned 1982 bonus of $412,000 and the gifted dividend of $500,000). 
  The trial judge also adjusted the real purchase price downward to reflect the 
  fact that Morris was to be paid over time and without interest. She concluded 
  that in actual 1983 dollars, Morris received the cash equivalent of $1,594,721.</p>
<p>
  [162] The trial judge found that the loan of $500,000 to IWS was grossly unfair 
  to Morris. The loan was without interest and for no stated purpose. Interest 
  rates in late 1983 were about twelve per cent.</p>
<p>
  [163] The trial judge next turned to the gifting agreement, whereby Morris received 
  a $500,000 dividend and immediately gave it to Chester. She found that this 
  transaction resulted in double taxation for Morris in that he paid tax on the 
  dividend and also paid tax when that same money came back to him as part of 
  the purchase price. She also found that Morris was deprived of certain tax benefits 
  that would flow to IWS from the declaration of the dividend. Finally, she found 
  that through the gifting arrangement, Chester effectively used $500,000 of Morris's 
  money to buy Morris's shares from him. </p>
<p> [164] The trial judge also determined that the lease was entirely one-sided 
  in Chester's favour. She concluded that the lease was so one-sided that Morris 
  would never have signed it had he been aware of the terms. The one-sided terms 
  highlighted by the trial judge included the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The lease was for fifty years with no increase in the rent during the fifty 
    year term.</li>
  <li>The rent, $2,000 per month ($1,000 payable to Morriston), was about $9,000 
    per month below fair market value according to the expert evidence accepted 
    by the trial judge.</li>
  <li>The rent did not increase after 2001, when the IWS Ferrous lease expired 
    and all of the Windermere Road and Centennial Parkway properties came under 
    the IWS lease.</li>
  <li>Should IWS default on the lease, Morriston could not take any action without 
    Chesterton's permission. Chester controlled both Chesterton and IWS.</li>
  <li>Morriston could not sell or mortgage its interest in the property without 
    the permission of Chesterton. Consequently, although the rent being paid to 
    Morriston would be less than Morriston's carrying costs, Morriston could not 
    sell or assign its interest in the property without Chesterton's permission.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [165] Having concluded that the transactions as documented were grossly unfair 
  to Morris, the trial judge then rejected Chester's evidence that his obligations 
  included the unstated obligations for potential environmental liabilities and 
  family responsibilities. The trial judge found that there were no discussions 
  about environmental liabilities and no estimates of potential clean-up costs 
  as of the end of December 1983. </p>
<p>
  [166] Morris recalled that on the evening he signed the documentation Ennis 
  phoned him at Chester's request. Ennis was upset and may have been drunk. He 
  told Morris not to blame Chester, that it was all Robert's fault. Morris was 
  distracted by his own health problems and pending angiogram and did not ask 
  Ennis for any explanation.</p>
<p>
  [167] Morris also testified that he wanted to prepare a will before his scheduled 
  angiogram on December 29, 1983. He arranged to meet with Wiseman and Ennis's 
  associate, Kevin Hope, at his home on December 26th. In the course of their 
  discussions, Hope told Morris that he did not own the Centennial Parkway property. 
  Morris was shocked when Hope told him that he did not own Centennial Parkway. 
  He could not understand how the property did not belong to him. Morris said 
  that he felt as though he was "finished". Despite this, Morris did 
  not ask Hope for any explanation because he was preoccupied with his will, concerns 
  about his own mortality, and looking after his affairs for his family. Hope 
  did not testify.</p>
<p>
  [168] In his testimony, Wiseman recalled that Morris was upset when he learned 
  that Centennial Parkway belonged to IWS. Wiseman said that Morris told him that 
  he had sold his shares in IWS. Wiseman said that he had several discussions 
  with Morris in the next few days and reviewed the share sale documents with 
  him and Taylor on December 28, 1983. Wiseman said that it was obvious that Morris 
  did not understand any aspect of the agreement and was very upset with what 
  had happened.</p>
<p>
  [169] The trial judge rejected Wiseman's evidence that Morris told him about 
  the share sale on December 26, 1983, and reviewed the documentation with him 
  on December 28th. In rejecting that evidence, the trial judge referred to prior 
  inconsistent statements Wiseman had made in an earlier affidavit, and the contrary 
  evidence of Taylor. Taylor's evidence, which was consistent with Morris's evidence, 
  was that Morris first learned of the share sale in early January 1984. The trial 
  judge also accepted the evidence of Shirley that Morris went into the hospital 
  on December 28th and remained with her either in the hospital or at home until 
  the end of the year. He did not meet with Wiseman or anyone else on these dates. 
  </p>
<p>
  [170] Linton testified that he did not discuss the share sale transaction with 
  Morris until January 1984. Linton further explained that pursuant to that transaction, 
  IWS declared a 1983 dividend of $1 million and had two $500,000 cheques prepared, 
  one payable to Morris and one payable to Chester. Linton said that Morris endorsed 
  his cheque to Chester to complete the $500,000 gift required under the share 
  sale transaction. Linton also testified that Chester paid Morris $1 million 
  by a cheque dated January 4, 1984, representing the first payment on the shares. 
  Morris signed a $500,000 cheque payable to IWS on the same day. That cheque 
  represented the loan from Morris to IWS. Chester's bank records confirm that 
  $1 million was deposited into his account on December 30, 1983. That amount 
  is described as a dividend. There is no documentation referring to the $500,000 
  cheque said to have been given by Morris to IWS. Many of the relevant banking 
  records, which were in the possession of IWS or Chester up to and during the 
  litigation, were not available. </p>
<p>
  [171] The existence of the alleged $1 million cheque dated January 4, 1984 from 
  Chester to Morris was supported by a duplicate carbon copy of a deposit slip 
  produced by Chester. No other bank documents, such as Morris's bank statements, 
  were available, although according to Linton, copies of these documents had 
  been kept in three different places under the control of Chester and IWS. Taylor 
  testified that on January 4th, Morris received a $500,000 cheque from IWS and 
  that on Taylor's advice, Morris deposited that at the Continental Bank. </p>
<p>
  [172] The trial judge concluded that there never was a $1 million cheque payable 
  by Chester to Morris dated January 4, 1984. In coming to that conclusion, she 
  relied on the evidence of Morris, Taylor, and the absence of relevant banking 
  documents. She held that the carbon copy of the deposit slip was not authentic. 
  The trial judge further held that Morris did not endorse a $500,000 cheque over 
  to Chester, but that $1 million representing the total dividend had simply been 
  deposited into Chester's account. Lastly, the trial judge held that Morris received 
  $500,000 on January 4th and that this money came to him by an IWS cheque.</p>
<p>
  [173] Morris testified that he first learned of the share sale on January 5, 
  1984 after he and Taylor deposited the $500,000 cheque from IWS into Morris's 
  account at the Continental Bank. Morris said that he had trouble understanding 
  the documents and the explanations given to him by Wiseman and Taylor. He was 
  very upset. Taylor confirmed that Morris was unhappy with the deal. </p>
<p>
  [174] Morris said that he spoke to Chester several times in January and that 
  Chester repeatedly told him to "calm down, just take it easy". Chester 
  assured Morris that they would talk later and that things would remain the same. 
  </p>
<p>
  [175] Morris met with Wiseman on several occasions in January 1984. Although 
  Wiseman and Morris disagreed on when the conversations took place - Wiseman 
  said late December 1983 and Morris said early 1984 - they agreed that Morris 
  was very upset about the transaction.</p>
<p>
  [176] Morris testified that Taylor arranged a meeting with Chester and Wiseman 
  at which Morris understood that the share sale would be discussed. Immediately 
  before the meeting Chester told Morris not to say anything in the meeting. To 
  Morris's surprise neither Taylor nor Wiseman raised the topic of the share sale 
  at the meeting.</p>
<p>
  [177] In early January, Linton and Chester discussed clarifying the nature of 
  the share transaction. In Linton's view, it was unclear whether the share sale 
  agreement called for a completed or a staged sale. The nature of the sale had 
  tax ramifications for Morris and a potentially significant impact on Chester's 
  ability to direct dividends from the company exclusively to himself as the sole 
  shareholder. Linton prepared documents instructing Ennis to revise the share 
  sale agreement so that it more clearly reflected a sale completed in January 
  1984. Chester subsequently signed those amending documents. Morris refused to 
  do so and never did sign the amended share sale documents. Chester testified 
  that he did not know until a couple of years later that Morris had refused to 
  sign the documents. Chester further testified that he had no reason to believe 
  that Morris was dissatisfied with the share transaction in January 1984. He 
  saw no change in his relationship with Morris. The trial judge rejected this 
  evidence and found that Chester knew in January 1984 that Morris was unhappy.</p>
<p>
  [178] It was Morris's evidence that during his discussions with Chester in January, 
  Chester assured him that nothing would change. He said that Morris would remain 
  as president, would draw a salary, as would Michael, and would keep the same 
  benefits. The trial judge held that these "concessions" by Chester 
  in January gave Morris some reason to believe that Chester would in fact undo 
  the share transaction.</p>
<p> [179] Morris was scheduled for open heart surgery on February 1, 1984. He 
  testified that immediately before going into the hospital, he was afraid, concerned 
  for his family's future, and upset at what had happened between Chester and 
  him. He felt that everything he had worked for all his life had been taken away 
  from him. On January 29, 1984, Morris wrote a stream of consciousness description 
  of events addressed to Taylor and Wiseman that was to be provided to his son 
  Michael, if Morris died in the hospital. He left a copy with Wiseman. These 
  notes, referred to as the "notes from the grave", figured prominently in the 
  argument of both counsel for Chester and Morris. The trial judge spent many 
  pages analyzing the notes and considering the competing submissions. She concluded 
  that, read in their entirety, the notes supported Morris's position that he 
  did not know what he had signed and that he believed Chester had tricked him 
  into signing the documents. The trial judge described the notes as being indicative 
  of a very troubled man trying to grapple with a growing recognition that his 
  brother, whom he had loved and trusted implicitly since childhood, had betrayed 
  him (para. 844).</p>
<p>
  [180] Morris gave evidence that the night before his open heart surgery, Chester 
  promised to tear up the share sale. Wiseman also testified that Morris told 
  him of this conversation shortly after the operation. </p>
<p>
  H. The Descent into Litigation</p>
<p> <a name="181"></a>[181] Although to the outside world Morris still appeared 
  to be involved in IWS, the company came under Chester's control after January 
  1, 1984. On Chester's instructions, Morriston and Chesterton were billed by 
  IWS for legal costs relating to the drafting of the 1981 IWS Ferrous lease and 
  for bookkeeping and management services. Chester instructed that any amounts 
  owing for these services should be deducted from the rent owed by IWS to Morriston 
  and Chesterton under the December 1983 lease agreement. This set-off meant that 
  apart from January 1984, Morriston did not receive even the $1,000 per month 
  rental amount called for by the lease.</p>
<p>
  [182] Linton testified that Morriston's loss of the rent was more than made 
  up for by the gaining of a tax deductible expense equal to the amount of the 
  administrative and legal fees charged to Morriston by IWS. Morris testified 
  that he did not learn that Morriston did not get any rents from IWS after January 
  1984 until after the litigation had started. No one ever asked Morris whether 
  the legal and administrative fees could be set off against the rent.</p>
<p>
  [183] The trial judge found that in the absence of any documentation to support 
  the charges to Morriston, she could not accept that the administrative and legal 
  charges imposed by IWS were real. She found that they were invented to permit 
  IWS to avoid paying even the modest $1,000 per month in rent that the December 
  1983 lease required IWS to pay to Morriston. She also found that Linton did 
  not seek Morris's approval of this scheme or even advise him about it. The beneficiary 
  of the scheme was IWS or Chester.</p>
<p>
  [184] Within two months of Chester's assuming full ownership of IWS, it severed 
  its trucking relationship with Greycliffe. Greycliffe purchased the trucks it 
  had been leasing and immediately sold several of them to IWS. IWS resold them 
  at a loss the following month. Robert explained that Greycliffe had stopped 
  trucking for IWS because IWS lost many of its American contracts and high insurance 
  costs made the trucking business less attractive. The trial judge rejected this 
  evidence noting that although Greycliffe's insurance rates spiked briefly, they 
  then returned to previous levels. The trial judge concluded that Greycliffe 
  ceased its trucking operation because once Chester and his sons had total ownership 
  and control of IWS it made no sense to continue to siphon off IWS profits to 
  Robert's company by paying exorbitant trucking rates. </p>
<p>
  [185] During their discussions in early 1984, Morris said that Chester had assured 
  him things at IWS would not change. Morris understood this to mean that he would 
  continue to receive drawings from IWS on an informal, as-needed basis. In fact, 
  on Chester's instructions, Linton charged Morris's drawings against the $500,000 
  loan purported to have been made by Morris to IWS as part of the share sale 
  transaction. Morris knew nothing about the supposed loan and was unaware that 
  drawings taken from him by IWS in 1984 were being charged against that loan. 
  </p>
<p>
  [186] Morris testified that he learned in April 1984 that Chester had not ripped 
  up the share sale as he had promised the night before Morris had open heart 
  surgery. Chester continued to assure him that he would do so. Morris testified 
  that in June 1984, Chester finally showed him the actual share sale documents. 
  When Morris questioned the effect of the documents, Chester said they would 
  talk later. Chester denied that this discussion ever took place.</p>
<p>
  [187] Ennis, Taylor and Wiseman all became concerned that the growing difficulties 
  between Morris and Chester could lead to problems in the day-to-day operation 
  of IWS and in the financial affairs of the company. Ennis and Chester were very 
  concerned that Morris had not signed the amended share sale documents. Although 
  Morris did not sign these documents, the dividend declared by IWS in 1984 went 
  entirely to Chester. Under the terms of the share sale that had been signed 
  by Morris, he still held shares as of the end of 1984.</p>
<p>
  [188] In the spring of 1985, Linton assembled the information needed to complete 
  Morris's 1984 tax return, drafted it and sent it to Wiseman. Wiseman had concerns 
  about whether the share sale as documented was a staged sale or a sale that 
  was completed in January 1984. Linton told Wiseman that it was a completed sale. 
  He prepared Morris's tax returns on the basis that Morris had sold all of his 
  250 shares in January 1984. </p>
<p>
  [189] In the spring of 1985, Wiseman met with Morris to discuss his 1984 tax 
  return. Wiseman told Morris that the share sale transaction had to be finalized 
  for tax purposes. Wiseman described a meeting with Morris, Chester, and Taylor 
  where the restructuring of payments and the share transfer was discussed. According 
  to Wiseman, Morris did not raise any concerns about the share sale. Also in 
  the spring of 1985, Linton and Ennis met with Scace. Morris was not at that 
  meeting. He said that Chester told him that this meeting was to find out how 
  to undo the deal.</p>
<p>
  [190] Morris said that he did not want to acknowledge the sale of any shares 
  to Chester in his 1984 tax return. Wiseman told him that he should fill out 
  the tax form on the basis that he had sold his shares, pay the taxes to avoid 
  any penalty, but not mail the return. As had been the case for many years, Morris's 
  personal taxes were paid by Linton through IWS. Linton delivered an IWS cheque 
  in the amount of $156,638 payable to Revenue Canada. Linton then deducted that 
  amount from the outstanding amount of the loan owing to Morris by IWS. All of 
  this was done without consulting Morris. On the trial judge's findings, Morris 
  was still unaware of the $500,000 loan that had supposedly been made by him 
  to IWS as part of the share sale transaction. </p>
<p>
  [191] Morris also testified that he met with Chester and his sons in the spring 
  of 1985 to discuss the concerns he had about filing a tax return reflecting 
  a share sale that Morris said had never happened. Morris prepared rather detailed 
  notes in anticipation of the meeting. Those notes included eleven points that 
  Morris wanted to discuss with Chester and his sons. Morris discussed those notes 
  in some detail in his evidence and the trial judge made extensive reference 
  to them in her reasons. Chester and his sons denied that the meeting ever occurred. 
  </p>
<p>
  [192] In the summer of 1985, Chester told Linton to pay the taxes on his sons' 
  as yet unadvanced 1982 bonuses and to transfer the remaining balances to him. 
  Linton did so and transferred about $594,000 in after-tax dollars to Chester. 
  He had earlier transferred $412,000 of Morris's 1982 bonus to Chester along 
  with about $650,000 in 1982 bonuses initially assigned to Kumer and other employees. 
  In addition to these amounts, in 1985, Chester received a non-taxable $250,000 
  dividend, a $42,000 taxable dividend and a $625,000 bonus. He also advised Morris 
  by letter in November 1985 that he would be postponing the $500,000 share sale 
  payment due in 1985 under the terms of the share sale agreement. </p>
<p>
  [193] Morris testified that he learned about the 1981 and 1982 bonuses for the 
  first time in the spring of 1985 when Wiseman told him. This was in the context 
  of discussions about Morris's tax returns and a possible restructuring of the 
  share sale. Although Wiseman said that this discussion occurred in 1984 and 
  not 1985, he agreed with Morris's evidence that Morris was very angry when he 
  found out about the size of these bonuses and that they were assigned to Chester 
  and his sons. Morris spoke to Chester about the bonuses and was told they were 
  not real, but were for tax purposes.</p>
<p>
  [194] The trial judge found that Morris first learned of the bonuses in the 
  spring of 1985. She also found that in the spring of 1985 the restructuring 
  of the share sale was discussed, but that Morris was not a party to these discussions. 
  Documents prepared for those discussions grossly overstated the amount of money 
  Morris had actually received on the share sale. She also found that Morris was 
  not told how his 1984 taxes were paid or of the existence of the loan account 
  from which the taxes were paid. The trial judge found that Wiseman ignored the 
  terms of the share sale agreement in preparing Morris's taxes and in treating 
  the share sale as completed as of January 4, 1984. She held that on a plain 
  reading of the agreement, the sale was a staged one and Morris still held shares 
  in IWS after January 1984. Consequently, even if the share sale was real, Chester 
  was not entitled to take for himself all of the dividends declared that year. 
  </p>
<p>
  [195] The trial judge rejected Chester's evidence that the reallocation of his 
  sons' bonuses to him was not intended to be permanent, but rather was done for 
  banking reasons. She rejected his evidence that he was holding the money on 
  behalf of his sons. On the trial judge's calculation, Chester ended up with 
  over $2.5 million of the $3.3 million in bonuses declared for 1982. Morris received 
  slightly less than $300,000. </p>
<p>
  [196] The trial judge also concluded that as of the end of 1985, Morris had 
  received some $1,125,000 on account of the share sale. He had received $500,000 
  on January 4, 1984, a $500,000 credit with IWS represented as a loan to IWS, 
  and a $250,000 cheque from Chester in December 1984. The $500,000 credit was 
  drawn down as IWS paid various expenses (e.g. taxes) for Morris. </p>
<p>
  [197] On Morris's evidence, Chester continued to promise he would undo the share 
  sale in 1985 and 1986. In one of those discussions, Chester promised that he 
  would "straighten out" the share sale if Morris would transfer his 
  Ancaster property to Chester's son Warren. Morris transferred the property to 
  Warren for $1 on January 1, 1986. After the transfer, Morris said he asked Chester 
  to make good on his promise, but Chester stalled him and never did keep his 
  promise.</p>
<p>
  [198] Chester denied any such conversation. He said that the Ancaster property 
  was partially paid for with partnership money in the 1950s and that Morris willingly 
  transferred the property to Warren. Warren testified that Morris was not impressed 
  with Warren's idea of building a house on the property, but willingly gave it 
  to Warren. </p>
<p>
  [199] By the middle of 1986, Ennis could see that Chester and Morris were not 
  getting along. There were numerous corporate documents that Morris, as president 
  of IWS, had not signed. Ennis assumed that the disagreement between the brothers 
  had something to do with the 1983 share sale. In a memo to Chester dated February 
  10, 1986, Ennis showed Morris as the owner of 145 of the 500 IWS shares. This 
  description was consistent, although not exactly the same, as the terms of the 
  share sale as documented at the December 22, 1983 meeting. According to the 
  amended share sale documents drawn in early 1984, Morris did not own any shares 
  after January 1984. Morris had never signed the amended documents.</p>
<p>
  [200] In April 1986, following his long established practice, Morris requested 
  that Linton look after his 1985 income taxes. Morris owed just under $49,000 
  in taxes. On Chester's instructions, Linton deposited a personal cheque for 
  $60,000 from Chester into Morris's account and typed the reference "payment 
  for 5 Shares" on the back of the cheque. Under the terms of the share sale 
  $60,000 was due to Morris in December 1986. Linton then prepared a cheque from 
  Morris payable to the Receiver General for Morris's taxes. Morris was never 
  told of the source of the funds for the payment of his taxes. The trial judge 
  found that Chester knew that Morris was unhappy with the share sale and was 
  attempting to build a "paper" record to support Chester's version 
  of events.</p>
<p>
  [201] By late December 1986, Morris had become sufficiently concerned about 
  the way things were being done at IWS to send the following letter to Linton: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [N]o cheques or moneys for Morris Waxman from any source can be deposited by 
  you or withdrawn for me without my written approval. This applies to any and 
  all documents for whatever reason.</p>
<p>
  [202] On the same day, on Chester's instructions and without Morris's authorization, 
  Linton deposited $440,000 into Morris's account. This represented the $500,000 
  payment due to Morris under the share sale minus the $60,000 that Chester had 
  put in Morris's account earlier in 1986. Linton later denied making this deposit. 
  Morris learned that the money had been deposited into his account in early 1987, 
  but he gave instructions that it should be returned to Chester. Chester testified 
  that he called Morris to ask him what was going on and Morris told him that 
  he was having considerable difficulty with the situation. Morris said that he 
  had not told his family about the share sale and that he now wanted to re-purchase 
  forty per cent of the IWS shares. Chester told him "that's not going to 
  happen" and deposited the $440,000 into a trust account. All IWS dividends 
  and bonuses for 1986 totalling $612,000 were paid to Chester. </p>
<p>
  [203] While vacationing in early 1987, Morris came to understand that the public 
  perceived that he had retired from IWS. This upset Morris and upon his return 
  from vacation, he arranged a meeting with Chester and his sons. In preparation 
  for that meeting, he wrote out in point form the topics that he wished to discuss. 
  These included Morris's claim that Chester had "concocted a scheme to take 
  from me what we worked for" and Chester's promise to "tear up everything". 
  After the meeting, Morris continued to talk to Chester. Chester and his sons 
  said there was no meeting. The trial judge accepted Morris's evidence. </p>
<p>
  [204] In April 1987, Chester instructed Linton to draw a cheque for $90,000 
  to pay Morris's income tax for 1986. The cheque was to be drawn on the trust 
  account Chester had established earlier that year when Morris returned the $440,000 
  to him. Chester wrote a covering letter enclosing the payment to Revenue Canada. 
  Morris was unaware of the cheque or the source of the funds. </p>
<p>
  [205] The trial judge found that as late as October 1987, Chester was describing 
  IWS as a partnership between himself and Morris. He used this description in 
  an interview given to a well-known business journal. Chester's public posture 
  gave Morris cause to believe that Chester would keep his word and return the 
  affairs of IWS to the way they had been in the 1970s.</p>
<p>
  [206] By April 1988, Morris was becoming frustrated in his attempts to get Chester 
  to undo the share transaction. He told Chester that he would be prepared to 
  go ahead with an estate freeze based on sixty per cent to Chester's family and 
  forty per cent to his family. Chester testified that Morris made an offer in 
  early 1988, but that he told Morris IWS was a totally different company than 
  it had been in December 1983 when Morris sold his shares. Chester suggested 
  that Morris was trying to get back into the company at a time when the economy 
  was good and prices were up.</p>
<p>
  [207] Morris's 1987 taxes were paid in 1988 with a cheque drawn on the trust 
  account that Chester had established for the share purchase funds Morris had 
  been refusing to accept since late 1986. Linton prepared the documentation and 
  initially testified that he discussed it with Morris. On cross-examination, 
  he said that his instructions came from Chester. Morris continued to refuse 
  to have anything to do with the money Chester had ordered placed in the trust 
  account. </p>
<p>
  [208] Morris testified that by the summer of 1988, he felt alienated at IWS. 
  It seemed to him that Robert was taking more control of the operation. Morris 
  went to see a lawyer who wrote to Chester in July 1988 indicating that it was 
  Morris's position that there had been "serious breaches of fiduciary duty 
  and other matters which are fatal to the agreements." Morris's lawyer suggested 
  an exploratory meeting. The concerns expressed in the letter were not addressed 
  by Chester before September 1988. </p>
<p>
  [209] Morris testified that on September 7th he finally told Michael about the 
  share sale. Michael was very upset. He confronted and threatened Chester at 
  his Windermere Road office and then went to the Centennial Parkway office and 
  did the same to Robert. </p>
<p>
  [210] On October 26, 1988, Linton handed Morris a letter firing him as president 
  of IWS and removing Michael, Morris and Shirley from the IWS payroll and benefit 
  plans effective immediately. Morris was surprised that Linton was firing the 
  president of IWS and shocked that his health benefits were being terminated 
  when everyone in the family knew his wife Shirley had just been diagnosed with 
  bladder cancer and required surgery. On the same day, Ennis gave Morris an account 
  for legal services to Morriston stretching back over many years. The next day, 
  Chester instructed Taylor Leibow not to release any documents or information 
  of any kind relating to any partnership or activity in which Chester had an 
  interest. Linton refused to give Morris his personal documents or documentation 
  belonging to Morriston. </p>
<p>
  [211] Robert acknowledged that in October and November 1988, he surreptitiously 
  removed some documents and copied many others he found in the SWRI offices located 
  at Centennial Parkway. </p>
<p>
  [212] Chester testified that Michael was seen burning documents at Centennial 
  Parkway in November 1988. Michael denied this and the trial judge accepted Michael's 
  evidence. </p>
<p>
  [213] Although Morris was fired from IWS on October 26, 1988, Michael continued 
  to operate SWRI at the Centennial Parkway property until he received a lawyer's 
  letter dated December 21, 1988 demanding that he leave the premises. The next 
  day security guards prevented Michael from removing SWRI's possessions from 
  the property. A confrontation occurred and the police were called. Michael eventually 
  left the property but not before he wrecked the SWRI offices. By this time, 
  Morris had started his lawsuit.</p>
<p>
  [214] On the same day that IWS fired Morris, Linton wrote him a letter demanding 
  that he repay IWS $51,058.02 said to be owed to the company. This was the first 
  written notice Morris had of the loan account, which had been established to 
  reflect the supposed $500,000 loan made by Morris to IWS as part of the share 
  sale agreement. All of Morris's drawings since that time had been debited against 
  that loan account. By October 1988 the account had a negative balance of just 
  over $51,000. Linton acknowledged that he had never provided Morris with any 
  statement of accounts showing the status of this loan account before October 
  1988. Linton took all of his instructions in relation to this account from Chester. 
  </p>
<p>
  [215] Morris's evidence, which the trial judge accepted, was that he knew nothing 
  about the loan account. He understood, as Chester had promised in early 1984, 
  that his drawing privileges had stayed the same. He did not know that his drawings 
  were being debited against the supposed loan. The trial judge rejected Linton's 
  evidence that he reviewed the account with Morris on a regular basis. </p>
<p>
  [216] 1988 was a very good year financially for IWS. Shortly after Morris commenced 
  the litigation, IWS, on Chester's instructions, declared bonuses of $8,750,000 
  for 1988. Of those bonuses, $3 million were allocated to Chester, $2.5 million 
  to Robert, $1.7 million to Warren and $1,550,000 to Gary.</p>
<p>
  [217] At the end of 1988, Chester put $1 million into the trust account he had 
  established when Morris refused to take money in payment for the purchase of 
  his shares. Chester described this payment as "Full and final payment" 
  of the amount owing under the share sale.</p>
<p>
  [218] The trial judge found that when Chester learned in the summer of 1988 
  that Morris had gone to a lawyer, Chester decided to develop a legal complaint 
  of his own in connection with Michael's and Morris's operation of SWRI. As noted 
  above, Chester and Robert interfered with Morris's attempts to get SWRI documents 
  in December 1988 and in the previous weeks had surreptitiously obtained and 
  copied SWRI documents. </p>
<p>
  [219] By January 1989, it was all-out war between Chester and Morris. Chester 
  had launched a counterclaim and IWS was refusing to pay the medical bills arising 
  out of Shirley's cancer treatment. Both sides were continuing to struggle over 
  access to and control of SWRI files and documents. The trial judge ultimately 
  held that Chester and those acting for him had no entitlement to those documents. 
  </p>
<p>
  [220] IWS declared bonuses of $6,450,000 in favour of Chester and his sons for 
  1989 and dividends in Chester's favour of $300,000. </p>
<p>
  [221] Between 1990 and 1992, Chester and his sons received bonuses totalling 
  about $4.7 million. A dividend of $2,250,000 was declared in favour of Chester 
  in 1993.</p>
<p> [222] The trial judge summarized her findings on the dividends and bonuses 
  IWS paid to Chester and his sons between 1984 and 1993 as follows. IWS declared: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>dividends of about $3.2 million in Chester's favour;</li>
  <li>bonuses of about $11.5 million in Chester's favour;</li>
  <li>bonuses of about $6.4 million in Robert's favour;</li>
  <li>bonuses of about $3.3 million in Warren's favour; and</li>
  <li>bonuses of about $3 million in Gary's favour.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [223] In September 1993, IWS transferred substantially all of its operating 
  assets to Waxman Resources in exchange for shares in Waxman Resources. Philip 
  purchased shares in Waxman Resources for $12 million plus Philip shares. By 
  1997, Waxman Resources had sold the Philip shares for some $18.4 million, thereby 
  receiving a total of about $30.4 million from the Philip sale. IWS retained 
  the Front 13 Acres at Centennial Parkway, a small piece of the property at Windermere 
  Road, the grease pit at Glow Avenue, the December 1983 lease, and the name "I. 
  Waxman &amp; Sons".</p>
<p>
  [224] The trial judge put her ultimate conclusion on the funds received by Chester 
  and his sons from IWS in these words: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Therefore, between 1984 and 1993, Chester/his sons/IWS received a total of $57,875,031 
  comprised of $24,258,000 in bonuses to Chester and his sons, $3,197,000 in dividends 
  to Chester and $30,420,031.24 to IWS from Philip (para. 1101).</p>
<p>
  V</p>
<p>
  NARRATIVE OF THE SWRI CLAIMS</p>
<p> <a name="225"></a>[225] As described above, three claims relate to SWRI: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Morris claimed that Chester induced Philip to breach its contracts with 
    SWRI [the inducing breach of contract claim];</li>
  <li>Chester counterclaimed in the main action brought by Morris alleging that 
    SWRI misappropriated business and corporate opportunities belonging to IWS; 
    and</li>
  <li>Chester counterclaimed in the inducing breach of contract action alleging 
    that fifty per cent of the common shares of SWRI were improperly transferred 
    from Chester's children to Morris's children in 1982.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [226] For the purposes of this narrative, the SWRI claims will be divided into 
  three parts, which correspond roughly to the three claims: </p>
<p class="indent5"> (a) the incorporation and reorganization of SWRI;</p>
<p class="indent5">(b) the operation of SWRI from 1982 to 1988; and</p>
<p class="indent5">(c) the termination of the SWRI - Philip relationship in 1989.</p>
<p>
  A. The Incorporation and Reorganization of SWRI</p>
<p> <a name="227"></a>[227] SWRI was incorporated in 1977 by Evans Husband. Chester 
  and Morris intended to use the company to bid for the Hamilton-Wentworth Region 
  garbage contract. Morris was the prime mover behind this attempt to get what 
  was a potentially very lucrative contract. He failed.</p>
<p>
  [228] As incorporated, SWRI had both preference and common shares. IWS held 
  the two thousand preference shares. Fifty common shares were held in trust for 
  Chester's children and fifty common shares were held in trust for Morris's children. 
  Morris and Chester were directors of SWRI. </p>
<p>
  [229] Up to 1977 SWRI did not conduct any business or have any assets. It remained 
  dormant until 1980 when it was used in connection with an attempt to secure 
  a refuse contract known as the "Sheppard's Quarry" contract. It was 
  anticipated that IWS would be entering into a non-competition agreement with 
  Laidlaw/Superior as part of Laidlaw's purchase of the IWS refuse division. To 
  circumvent that agreement SWRI was used as the potential party to the Sheppard's 
  Quarry contract.</p>
<p>
  [230] A receipt signed by Ennis's assistant indicated that Ennis &amp; Associates 
  received SWRI's books and records from Evans Husband on October 21, 1980. Ennis 
  drafted a letter of intent in connection with the Sheppard's Quarry contract 
  showing SWRI as a party to that agreement. Ennis testified that the books and 
  records of SWRI did not arrive at his law firm until July 1982. The trial judge, 
  relying on his office records, found that his firm received the records in October 
  1980. She also found that Morris pursued the Sheppard's Quarry contract with 
  Chester's support and that Chester knew that SWRI was being used as the potential 
  party to the contract to circumvent any possible limitations arising from the 
  non-competition agreements required by Laidlaw/Superior in connection with the 
  purchase of the IWS refuse division. The trial judge accepted Morris's evidence 
  that Chester said he did not want Michael and Douglas to be required to sign 
  any non-competition agreements with Laidlaw/Superior.</p>
<p>
  [231] Morris did not obtain the Sheppard's Quarry contract. SWRI did not carry 
  on any business until the middle of 1982. In 1982, Allen Fracassi, a principal 
  of Philip, came to IWS with a proposal that Philip and IWS share a contract 
  for the transport and disposal of 100,000 containers of cement kiln dust. IWS 
  could not pursue this opportunity as it would be in breach of its non-competition 
  agreements with Laidlaw/Superior. Chester also had little interest in the waste 
  aspect of IWS's business. To him it was a very small part of the IWS operation 
  and was not "deserving of my focus."</p>
<p>
  [232] Morris and Michael testified that Chester encouraged SWRI to pursue the 
  business opportunity presented by Fracassi. The trial judge found that the books 
  and records of SWRI, which were now at Ennis &amp; Associates, were then altered 
  to remove any connection between SWRI and IWS and any connection between SWRI 
  and Morris and Chester. This was done to avoid ay potential conflict with the 
  non-competition agreements. The two thousand preference shares initially owned 
  by IWS were deleted from the books and records as were any references to Morris 
  and Chester as directors. Michael and Douglas, who unlike Chester's sons were 
  not bound by any non-competition agreement, became the owners and directors 
  of SWRI.</p>
<p>
  [233] Chester denied any knowledge of the restructuring of SWRI. He maintained 
  that Morris had secretly instructed Ennis to transfer the SWRI shares from Chester's 
  children to Michael and Douglas. The trial judge rejected this evidence. She 
  found that given the close relationship between Ennis and Chester and Chester's 
  dominant role in that relationship, it was inconceivable that Ennis would restructure 
  SWRI to exclude Chester's children without first consulting with and receiving 
  instructions from Chester.</p>
<p>
  [234] Ennis testified that he knew nothing about the original share structure 
  of SWRI. Morris told him that the common shares were to be transferred to Morris's 
  sons. Ennis denied removing any material from the SWRI corporate records or 
  altering those records. According to Ennis, he acted on Morris's instructions 
  alone, without any supporting documentation, because SWRI was a worthless shell 
  company. He said that when the materials arrived at his law firm from Evans 
  Husband there were virtually no corporate records. </p>
<p>
  [235] The trial judge rejected Ennis's evidence for several reasons. A handwriting 
  expert testified that a word on an altered share certificate stub referable 
  to the preference shares was in all likelihood written by Irene Cook, an employee 
  of Ennis &amp; Associates. The Ennis &amp; Associates accounts indicated that 
  the restructuring of SWRI and the preparation and backdating of corporate records 
  from 1982 to 1979 was done by the firm. Finally the trial judge observed that 
  there were several serious inconsistencies between Ennis's trial evidence and 
  his evidence on discovery.</p>
<p>
  [236] The trial judge concluded that in September 1982, Ms. Cook, on Ennis's 
  instructions, prepared minutes of an SWRI directors' meeting backdated to August 
  1, 1979. The minutes documented the transfer of common shares to Michael and 
  to Ms. Cook as trustee for Douglas (who was under eighteen as of August 1979). 
  Corporate records were also prepared to show Michael and Ms. Cook as directors. 
  Further documentation was subsequently prepared transferring the shares from 
  Ms. Cook, in trust, to Douglas as of May 4, 1981, the date he reached the age 
  of majority. Corresponding documentation described Ms. Cook's resignation as 
  a director and the appointment of Douglas as a director. On the reconstructed 
  corporate records there was no apparent connection between IWS and SWRI or between 
  Chester and Morris and SWRI. The preference shares were gone and the common 
  shares were transferred to Michael and Douglas, in trust, as of August 1, 1979. 
  </p>
<p>
  [237] There was no direct evidence that Chester gave any instructions to Ennis 
  in connection with the restructuring. The trial judge concluded, however, that 
  the restructuring was done on Chester's instructions. She relied on Ennis's 
  evidence that on all "major matters" he would contact Chester before 
  acting and seek his instructions. The trial judge concluded that the restructuring 
  of SWRI to permit it to pursue the business venture presented by Fracassi was 
  a "major matter".</p>
<p>
  [238] The trial judge found that initially Chester was motivated to restructure 
  SWRI as a way of getting around the Laidlaw/Superior non-competition agreement. 
  By 1982, however, Chester also saw SWRI as a vehicle to be used by Michael to 
  pursue the waste business apart from IWS and to keep Michael occupied elsewhere. 
  Chester believed that if Michael busied himself with SWRI and the remnants of 
  the IWS refuse business he would not be likely to try and interfere in the scrap 
  metal business. On the trial judge's finding, after the restructuring of SWRI, 
  Chester and Morris both understood that it could be used by Michael to build 
  an active business.</p>
<p>
  [239] The trial judge also found that documentation signed by Chester's children 
  agreeing to the transfer of the common shares of SWRI was signed in 1982 and 
  backdated to 1979. She found that the lawyer Hayman had arranged for the necessary 
  consents. In coming to this conclusion, the trial judge relied on Hayman's evidence 
  that although he had no specific recollection of obtaining these documents, 
  it was his normal practice to obtain the beneficiary's written consent to transfers 
  of shares. Hayman knew of no reason why he would not follow his usual practice 
  on this occasion.</p>
<p>
  [240] The original Evans Husband SWRI file went missing during the litigation. 
  There was evidence that after the litigation started, Robert had reviewed the 
  file in the Evans Husband office. Robert was asked if he removed any documents 
  from the file during that review. The trial judge interpreted Robert's answer 
  as indicating that he could not be sure whether or not he had removed any documents. 
  The trial judge used the evidence of Robert's opportunity to remove the documents 
  and his ambiguous answer to find that he removed SWRI documentation from the 
  Evans Husband file after this litigation started. </p>
<p>
  [241] The trial judge ultimately concluded that Morris, Michael and Douglas 
  did not steal the shares of SWRI. Rather, Chester agreed that Michael could 
  use SWRI to pursue the waste disposal business for himself and Douglas. When 
  SWRI was "restructured" in 1982, it had no value and little attention 
  was paid to the details of the corporate restructuring or the dates of the documents. 
  Hayman had obtained the appropriate consents to transfer the common shares from 
  Chester's children, but after this litigation had started Robert had removed 
  them from the file. The preference shares held by IWS were cancelled as of 1982. 
  The trial judge further held that to the extent that rectification of the SWRI 
  records was necessary to reflect the changes made in the 1982, that rectification 
  should be ordered.</p>
<p>
  B. The Operation of SWRI Between 1982-1988</p>
<p> <a name="242"></a>[242] SWRI started slowly. Its gross revenues for 1982 were 
  $39,025. Gross revenues fell to $31,121 in 1983. Most of the revenue came from 
  contracts with Philip for the removal of kiln dust and with Stelco for the disposal 
  of wood. SWRI used IWS's administrative services and IWS provided haulage on 
  some of the contracts. According to Morris, Chester approved of SWRI's involvement 
  in these contracts. IWS could not have taken this business without violating 
  its non-competition agreements with Laidlaw/Superior. </p>
<p>
  [243] In 1984, SWRI's gross revenues increased substantially to $835,541. It 
  continued to do most of its work with Philip and Stelco. Morris testified that 
  Chester knew that SWRI's business was expanding. IWS continued to provide haulage 
  services for SWRI in connection with some of its contracts. Many of the contracts 
  were taken up by SWRI because either the non-competition agreements with Laidlaw/Superior 
  or the terms of the IWS Ferrous agreement prevented IWS from being involved.</p>
<p>
  [244] In 1985, SWRI's gross revenues dropped to $405,895. In the course of that 
  year, several waste accounts with IWS scrap metal clients were transferred from 
  IWS to Philip. IWS had been allowed to keep these accounts under its contract 
  with Laidlaw/Superior. Morris explained that the accounts were moved with the 
  full support of Chester because new environmental regulations put a heavy onus 
  on those involved in the disposal of this kind of waste. Some of the accounts 
  were handled by SWRI directly and others by Philip with SWRI receiving a commission. 
  According to Morris, Chester was fully aware of and content with these transactions. 
  When it was suggested to Morris that he had stolen these accounts from IWS for 
  SWRI, Morris responded: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The accounts were turned over by Chester Waxman. They couldn't have been stolen. 
  If he wanted them back, he had the power of an elephant compared to a flea, 
  which Solid Waste was. All he had [to] do was walk to Stelco or any customer 
  and tell them the accounts were his. He didn't need me to do that. He didn't 
  need Michael to do [that].</p>
<p>
  [245] SWRI's gross revenues for 1986 exceeded $1.3 million. The company continued 
  to haul refuse of various kinds that had previously been handled by IWS. It 
  also expanded a new business that involved hauling electronic air furnace flue 
  dust ("EAF dust") from plants and processing for use in the manufacture 
  of cement. Lasco became a prime source of the EAF dust for SWRI. Morris testified 
  that Chester knew about this new aspect of the business and was instrumental 
  in obtaining the contract with Lasco. IWS could not take the Lasco business 
  because of its partnership with Lasco in IWS Ferrous. IWS was also not in the 
  business of processing EAF dust for use in the manufacture of cement. Chester 
  denied knowing anything about this new aspect of SWRI's business or assisting 
  Michael in obtaining the contract with Lasco.</p>
<p>
  [246] Laidlaw/Superior's non-competition agreements with IWS expired in 1986. 
  Chester showed no interest in taking IWS back into the waste disposal business. 
  </p>
<p>
  [247] 1987 was a very good year for SWRI. Gross revenues exceeded $3.1 million. 
  The EAF dust business thrived, particularly with Lasco. Michael testified that 
  Chester continued to assist him in developing new business for SWRI. Michael 
  used his uncle's name to gain an introduction to potential customers.</p>
<p>
  [248] 1988 was also a good year for SWRI. Gross revenues were just under $3 
  million. Most of the revenue again came from the EAF dust business, about half 
  of which was with Lasco. Philip continued to provide the haulage on several 
  of the contracts and also had the necessary licences for the disposal of some 
  of the environmentally sensitive waste products.</p>
<p> [249] The trial judge concluded that between 1982 and 1988, SWRI operated 
  in an open and public way out of the offices of Centennial Parkway. She rejected 
  outright Chester's evidence that he was unaware of the nature of SWRI's business 
  activities until 1988. She referred to the evidence of Linton and Chester's 
  sons who said they were aware of the nature of the SWRI business. She also referred 
  to Ennis's evidence that he knew as early as 1983 that SWRI was an active company 
  carrying on business. When Ennis was asked if Chester was aware of the activities 
  of SWRI he said of course Chester knew that. Of course he knew they were carrying 
  on business. Why would he not- They had offices at Centennial.</p>
<p>
  [250] Linton also testified that "there was no secret" to the fact 
  that SWRI was carrying on business in the 1980s. It participated in at least 
  one project that attracted considerable public attention.</p>
<p>
  [251] The trial judge further concluded that SWRI was distinct from and operated 
  separately from IWS and that Chester knew this. Linton treated SWRI as a company 
  separate from IWS, Ennis billed SWRI separately for services and when IWS needed 
  an arm's length purchaser for a transaction involving a company called Intercelco, 
  SWRI served as purchaser. </p>
<p> [252] After an exhaustive consideration of the various accounts that SWRI 
  serviced between 1983 and 1988, the trial judge concluded: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Some of the SWRI accounts were with IWS customers. The accounts were initially 
    held by IWS. Chester had agreed SWRI could take over these refuse contracts.</li>
  <li>Some of the business operated by SWRI, particularly the EAF dust business, 
    was developed by SWRI and Philip. This business had nothing to do with IWS 
    although Chester did help Michael get some of the contracts.</li>
  <li>Some of the SWRI contracts were contracts that IWS could not take either 
    because of the Laidlaw/Superior non-competition agreements or because of IWS's 
    involvement in the IWS Ferrous partnership.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [253] Based on these findings of fact the trial judge rejected Chester's claim 
  that SWRI had misappropriated IWS business and business opportunities. She dismissed 
  this part of the counterclaim although she did allow relatively minor miscellaneous 
  claims, which need not be detailed here.</p>
<p>
  C. The Termination of the SWRI-Philip Relationship in 1989</p>
<p> <a name="254"></a>[254] The relationship between SWRI and Philip grew and 
  prospered until the early part of 1989. The legal relationship between Philip 
  and SWRI varied from contract to contract. Sometimes Philip and SWRI were joint 
  venturers and sometimes Philip was a sub-contractor of SWRI. Generally speaking, 
  Philip did the physical work including transportation of the product as well 
  as providing the necessary licences from the Ministry of the Environment. </p>
<p>
  [255] Philip continued to do business with SWRI in January and February of 1989 
  following the commencement of Morris's lawsuit against Chester and Chester's 
  counterclaim against Morris. Chester also counterclaimed against Philip. Fracassi 
  and Robert discussed the potential settlement of Chester's counterclaim against 
  Philip. Robert wanted Fracassi to sign a statutory declaration, but he was not 
  prepared to sign the draft provided to him by Robert. At one stage of the negotiations 
  between Fracassi and Robert, Fracassi threatened to sue IWS for intentional 
  interference with its economic relationship with SWRI.</p>
<p>
  [256] IWS discontinued its counterclaim against Philip on March 7, 1989. On 
  the same day, Philip terminated its relationship with SWRI. Morris claimed that 
  Philip was induced to terminate the relationship with SWRI in part by a promise 
  from Chester to discontinue his counterclaim against Philip. Chester and Fracassi 
  insisted that there was no connection between the discontinuation of the lawsuit 
  and the termination on the very same day of the six-year business relationship 
  between SWRI and Philip.</p>
<p>
  [257] According to Fracassi, Philip terminated its business relationship with 
  SWRI because Fracassi learned through Robert that SWRI had been cheating Philip 
  on the Lasco contract involving the removal and treatment of EAF dust since 
  1986. The 1986 contract was for three years and in late 1988, Michael had negotiated 
  a renewal of the contract.</p>
<p>
  [258] Fracassi testified that in the course of discussions with the IWS lawyers 
  about the counterclaim against Philip, he was presented with copies of three 
  documents relating to the Lasco contract. The first was a copy of the Lasco 
  contract with SWRI dated October 24, 1986, the second was a settlement letter 
  between SWRI and Lasco dated February 24, 1987 altering the rates charged by 
  SWRI as of October 1988, and the third was a proposal from SWRI to Lasco dated 
  November 7, 1988 setting out the terms on which Michael proposed that the contract 
  should be renewed. </p>
<p>
  [259] According to Fracassi, he had received similar but not identical documents 
  from Michael on or near the dates reflected in the three documents. Fracassi 
  testified that the documents provided to him by Michael set out disposal and 
  transportation rates that were lower than the rates set out in the copies given 
  to him by the IWS lawyers in 1989. Philip had billed SWRI at these lower rates. 
  Fracassi said that when he compared the documents Michael had given him with 
  the documents the IWS lawyers had given to him in 1989 he realized that SWRI 
  had been cheating Philip by paying it at the altered lower rates for transportation 
  and disposal of the Lasco material. Fracassi said that as soon as he realized 
  that his "partner" had been cheating him he immediately decided to 
  terminate the business relationship. It was a coincidence that the termination 
  happened on the same day that IWS discontinued its lawsuit against Philip.</p>
<p>
  [260] It was common ground at trial that there were two sets of the three Lasco 
  documents, one real and one altered. The transportation and disposal rates had 
  been lowered on the altered set. It was also common ground that the altered 
  set of the documents came into existence some time in or before March 1989. 
  The dispute centered around the identity of the forger and the purpose of the 
  forgery. </p>
<p>
  [261] Chester maintained that Fracassi should be believed. Michael had given 
  him the altered version of the documents in the course of their business dealings 
  to mislead Fracassi about the amount being paid by Lasco for disposal and transportation 
  thereby allowing SWRI to increase its profit on the contract at the expense 
  of Philip. Morris and Michael maintained that SWRI did not give Fracassi any 
  of the Lasco documents. Philip was not a party to the contract and there was 
  no need to give Philip the documents. Morris contended that Robert must have 
  found copies of the actual Lasco documents during his surreptitious search through 
  the SWRI documents in October and November of 1988. He must have then altered 
  copies of the three documents and presented them to Fracassi to give Fracassi 
  an excuse for ending the relationship with SWRI. Morris argued that the forged 
  altered documents provided a pretext for the termination of the SWRI/Philip 
  relationship, which in turn destroyed SWRI.</p>
<p>
  [262] Fracassi and Robert told different stories about how they discovered the 
  altered documents. According to Robert, he and Fracassi were reviewing the documents 
  Robert had stolen from the SWRI offices and comparing them with the documents 
  Fracassi had in his possession. They made a mutual discovery of the altered 
  documents in the course of this comparison. Fracassi denied reviewing the documents 
  with Robert. He said that the altered documents came, unrequested, from IWS's 
  lawyers, with a letter which described the documents as "important and 
  necessary in regard to this litigation". Fracassi did not know how Robert 
  or IWS's lawyers acquired the documents but he did know that Robert had wanted 
  him to see the documents so that he would know "what the transactions were".</p>
<p>
  [263] The trial judge found that Philip did not receive copies of the Lasco 
  documents from Michael. She accepted the evidence that Philip was not a party 
  to the October 1986 agreement between Lasco and SWRI and that Philip was a sub-contractor 
  of SWRI. In its capacity as a sub-contractor there was no reason to give Philip 
  copies of the contract between Lasco and SWRI or copies of correspondence between 
  Lasco and SWRI.</p>
<p>
  [264] In rejecting Fracassi's evidence that Philip had been provided with the 
  altered contracts by Michael and had relied on those documents when billing 
  SWRI, the trial judge relied heavily on the evidence of the amounts actually 
  charged by Philip as reflected in their invoices. Philip's charges did not coincide 
  with the rates set out in the altered documents but rather coincided with the 
  amounts set out in a letter from SWRI to Lasco dated November 17, 1986. That 
  letter increased the rates that had been agreed on in October of 1986 as reflected 
  in the October contract. There was no altered counterpart to the November 17, 
  1986 letter.</p>
<p>
  [265] The trial judge found that whoever had prepared the altered version of 
  the October 1986 contract was unaware of the November letter clarifying and 
  adjusting the terms of the October agreement. In the trial judge's view, if 
  SWRI were cheating Philip it would not have paid Philip at the rate described 
  in the unaltered November 17, 1986 letter. In brief, Philip's own invoices reflected 
  payment in accordance with the actual terms agreed upon between Lasco and SWRI 
  as of November 1986.</p>
<p>
  [266] The trial judge's conclusion concerning the altered documents is set out 
  at para. 1760: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I find that Robert tampered with the documents, then presented them to Fracassi 
  through his lawyer in both real and altered form in order to induce [Philip] 
  to terminate its contract with SWRI. On March 3, or shortly thereafter, Robert, 
  on Chester's instructions, also made Fracassi understand that if Philip stopped 
  doing business with SWRI, it would be able to dramatically increase its revenues 
  because it would be able to keep 100% of the profits it had been sharing with 
  SWRI.</p>
<p>
  [267] SWRI was virtually ruined by the termination of its business relationship 
  with Philip. Within a year, SWRI revenues had dropped by ninety per cent. Philip 
  acquired much of the business that it had previously shared with SWRI.</p>
<p>
  [268] The trial judge found that Chester induced Philip to breach its contract 
  with SWRI through the combined use of economic pressure (the dropping of the 
  lawsuit if Philip stopped doing business with SWRI), promises of future business 
  (the assuming of the SWRI contracts), and forged documents (the altered Lasco 
  documents). She held that had Chester not interfered with the relationship between 
  Philip and SWRI that relationship would have continued and prospered.</p>
<p>
  [269] Morris tendered expert evidence that set out four ways in which the losses 
  suffered by SWRI could be calculated. The trial judge chose the one most favourable 
  to Morris. That approach assumed that the existing contracts between SWRI and 
  Philip would be completed and renewed for an additional term. It also assumed 
  growth in revenues from those contracts anticipated by SWRI management immediately 
  before the breach. Using this methodology SWRI losses were about $2.8 million. 
  After certain adjustments the trial judge fixed the damages at $2.5 million. 
  She added $100,000 in punitive damages against Chester and Robert. </p>
<p>
  VI</p>
<p>
  THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</p>
<p>
  A. The Findings of Fact: The Broad Attacks</p>
<p>
  i. Introduction</p>
<p> <a name="270"></a>[270] Chester's factum begins with the assertion that the 
  trial judge made "at least" fifty findings of fact that were "demonstrably and 
  palpably wrong". In oral argument, Mr. Lenczner, counsel for Chester, alleged 
  "hundreds" of factual errors. The appellants contend that virtually every facet 
  of the fact-finding process was fatally flawed. They argue that the trial judge 
  disbelieved the witnesses that she should have believed, believed the witnesses 
  that she should have disbelieved, made erroneous assessments of the reliability 
  of evidence, especially documentary evidence, ignored other relevant evidence, 
  failed to properly weigh competing pieces of evidence, drew unwarranted inferences 
  from primary findings of fact, failed to draw inferences that were obvious from 
  other proven facts and gave unwarranted weight to certain expert evidence.</p>
<p>
  [271] The appellants maintain that the factual errors made by the trial judge 
  are so numerous, so obvious, and so crucial to the central issues at trial that 
  they necessitate not only a rejection of the trial judge's factual findings, 
  but also compel contrary findings of fact by this court. They submit that on 
  a proper assessment of the evidence, Morris's claims should be dismissed in 
  their entirety and Chester's counterclaims should succeed in their entirety.</p>
<p>
  [272] Although the trial judge had to grapple with many difficult legal issues, 
  this was first and foremost a factual dispute. The resolution of the factual 
  disputes to a large extent determined the outcome of the trial. Not only were 
  the facts hotly contested, the competing versions of the relevant events were 
  diametrically opposed on most important factual issues. For example, Morris 
  testified that apart from a few brief references, there was never any mention 
  of him selling his IWS shares to Chester before December 1983, much less any 
  negotiation for the sale of those shares. Chester, however, described lengthy 
  negotiations between himself and Morris that went on for well over a year and 
  culminated in two lengthy meetings in late December where he, Morris, and Ennis 
  went over all of the relevant documents line by line at least twice. </p>
<p>
  [273] Although there was evidence (e.g. parts of Wiseman's testimony and the 
  "notes from the grave") that could have supported findings of fact 
  about the share sale that were not consistent with either the evidence of Morris 
  or Chester, no one suggested to the trial judge, or to this court, that those 
  findings of fact should be made. The parties chose to stand or fall on the testimony 
  of their chief spokesmen, Morris and Chester. Practically speaking, the trial 
  judge was left with no middle ground on most important factual questions. Her 
  findings of fact on the many crucial factual issues reflect the stark conflict 
  in the versions of events presented in the evidence of Morris and Chester and 
  in the arguments made at trial.</p>
<p>
  [274] The either/or tenor of the evidence and arguments placed a premium on 
  the trial judge's assessment of the credibility of the key witnesses, especially 
  Morris and Chester. It is no overstatement to say that, despite the complexity 
  of this litigation and the mass of evidence adduced by the parties, the outcome 
  turned in large measure on the trial judge's assessment of the credibility of 
  Morris and Chester. She made that assessment crystal clear in her reasons: Morris 
  was credible; Chester was not. </p>
<p>
  [275] As the trial judge's reasons demonstrate, her credibility assessments 
  flowed from a detailed consideration of the entirety of the evidence. Her findings 
  reflect both an overall assessment of the credibility of Morris and Chester 
  and specific assessments of their credibility as it applied to the numerous 
  events described by them in very different ways in their evidence. The overall 
  credibility assessments are obviously the product of the many specific assessments. 
  The specific credibility assessments cannot, however, be viewed in isolation 
  from each other. For example, the trial judge rejected Chester's evidence that 
  Morris was aware of and agreed to the payment of bonuses to Chester's sons in 
  1979, 1981 and 1982. Her conclusion that Chester's evidence concerning the bonuses 
  was not credible was a product not just of a close analysis of the evidence 
  concerning the bonuses, but also of the trial judge's negative assessment of 
  the credibility of Chester on other matters as diverse as his father's intentions 
  with concerning the control of IWS after his death and Chester's knowledge of 
  the operation of SWRI between 1982 and 1988. </p>
<p>
  [276] The credibility findings made against Chester, and his sons, especially 
  Robert, go beyond a simple rejection of their evidence as unreliable. The trial 
  judge found that from 1988 onward, Chester and Robert engaged in a litigation 
  strategy aimed at fabricating a case against Morris, while at the same time 
  preventing Morris from pursuing his case against them. The trial judge held 
  that Chester and/or Robert stole documents (e.g. the SWRI documents removed 
  from the SWRI offices in the fall of 1988), fabricated documents (e.g. SWRI 
  documents and the January 4, 1984 deposit slip), did not produce documents (e.g. 
  the documents supposedly lost in the "selective" flood), and failed 
  to produce other documents in a timely fashion. </p>
<p>
  [277] The detailed and uncompromising credibility assessments made by the trial 
  judge raise a very high hurdle for the appellants on these appeals. At every 
  turn in their arguments, counsel for the appellants are met with credibility 
  findings squarely against them. They cannot escape these pervasive credibility 
  assessments by attacking these findings where they relate to specific issues 
  in isolation from other credibility findings. The trial judge's finding that 
  from the outset Chester's case was spun from dishonesty and greed hangs like 
  a shroud over the appellants' submissions in this court.</p>
<p>
  ii. The Allegation that the Trial Judge Reasoned from a Predetermined Result</p>
<p> <a name="278"></a>[278] The appellants' attack on the trial judge's findings 
  of fact is ambitious if not bold. Before turning directly to their arguments 
  aimed at the findings of fact, it is necessary to dispose of an argument lurking 
  just under the surface of the appellants' attack on the findings of fact.</p>
<p>
  [279] In his facta, and to some extent in his oral submissions, Mr. Lenczner 
  used language suggesting something other than factual errors by the trial judge. 
  He referred to the trial judge "deliberately ignoring" and "manipulating" 
  evidence in the course of her fact-finding. Counsel also submitted that the 
  trial judge did not "treat the evidence objectively", was determined 
  "to excuse every piece of evidence" that hurt Morris's claims, "pretended" 
  that the evidence was other than it actually was in order to further Morris's 
  claims, and "quite cunningly" drew inferences that favoured Morris.</p>
<p>
  [280] Counsel's language strongly suggests an allegation of bias. When Mr. Lenczner 
  was asked in oral argument whether he was alleging bias or some other form of 
  improper judicial conduct, he disavowed any such contention and explained: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I am saying that the trial judge started from a conclusion that she wanted to 
  start from and worked backward and made facts to fit her conclusion which is 
  not the correct process. </p>
<p>
  [281] Despite counsel's statement, it remained unclear to the court at the end 
  of argument whether the appellants were alleging bias or some other improper 
  conduct by the trial judge. Nothing during the course of the trial provides 
  a basis for such a claim, and the appellants did not suggest otherwise. Despite 
  the length and complexity of this bitterly contested trial, the trial judge 
  exemplified throughout the highest standards of judicial conduct.</p>
<p>
  [282] The submission that the trial judge improperly began with the conclusions 
  "that she wanted" and worked backward in her reasons to justify those 
  conclusions has no merit. The trial judge's observations early in her reasons 
  provide a candid description of her thought processes as the evidence and arguments 
  unfolded. These observations refute any suggestion that she began with a preconceived 
  notion of the desirable result. She concluded her description of her intellectual 
  journey in these terms at para. 24: </p>
<p class="indent">
  After a detailed analysis of all of the evidence, I eventually preferred the 
  evidence of two witnesses over the evidence of many: specifically, that of Morris 
  and Michael over that of Chester, his sons, Sheldon Kumer ("Kumer") 
  and others. I concluded, given the nature of the allegations and my acceptance 
  of the evidence of few over many, that it was necessary to set out in some detail 
  the basis for my factual findings.</p>
<p>
  [283] The submission that the trial judge's reasons reveal that she began with 
  the desired conclusion and analyzed the evidence with a view to justifying that 
  conclusion, misunderstands the nature and purpose of reasons for judgment. Reasons 
  for judgment are written after the trial judge has analyzed the evidence, made 
  the necessary credibility assessments and findings of fact, and reached her 
  conclusions. Reasons for judgment are offered as an explanation for the result 
  arrived at by the trial judge. They explain the result of the reasoning process. 
  They are not exhaustive contemporaneous notes of the process itself: R. v. Sheppard 
  (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 298 at 308 (S.C.C.). They cannot be read as a travelogue 
  of the trial judge's voyage of discovery through the evidence: R. v. Morrissey 
  (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 204 (Ont. C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [284] The trial judge decided that Chester and others who testified in support 
  of his version of events had lied, fabricated documents, destroyed other relevant 
  documents, and failed to produce still other relevant documents. It is hardly 
  surprising that her reasons paint those individuals in a poor light. Reasons 
  for judgment that reflect and support conclusions and evidentiary assessments 
  already made by the trial judge are not indicative of an improper analysis of 
  the evidence or a preconceived notion of the appropriate result of the case. 
  To the contrary, reasons for judgment that did not accurately reflect those 
  conclusions and assessments would be seriously flawed.</p>
<p>
  iii. Overview of the Fact-Based Arguments</p>
<p> <a name="285"></a>[285] The appellants' attack on the fact-finding of the 
  trial judge moves on three broad fronts. First, they contend that the findings 
  were unreasonable. In support of this contention, the appellants ask this court 
  to make an independent assessment of the evidence and test the trial judge's 
  findings of fact against a reasonableness standard. For example, the appellants 
  argue that when all of the evidence is examined, particularly the extensive 
  documentation relating to the share sale, it is simply unreasonable to conclude 
  that Morris did not know that he was selling his shares in IWS when he executed 
  the various documents.</p>
<p>
  [286] The second prong of the appellants' argument is based on alleged errors 
  in the processing of the evidence by the trial judge. The appellants argue that 
  the trial judge misapprehended evidence, failed to consider relevant evidence, 
  and reached factual conclusions in the absence of any evidence to support those 
  conclusions. For example, the trial judge found that Robert removed certain 
  SWRI documentation from Hayman's file. This finding, say the appellants, was 
  based on her understanding that Robert had testified that he may have removed 
  such documentation. The appellants claim that Robert gave no such evidence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [287] The third challenge advanced by the appellants takes aim at the trial 
  judge's credibility assessments. The appellants contend that even allowing for 
  the high deference that this court must accord the trial judge's credibility 
  assessments, many of those assessments are arbitrary, contrary to the overwhelming 
  weight of the evidence, or are flawed by the various processing errors referred 
  to above. For example, the appellants submit that the trial judge rejected Kumer's 
  evidence concerning the 1981-82 bonuses for a reason which, even allowing for 
  the widest deference, could not justify the rejection of that evidence.</p>
<p>
  [288] In this part of our reasons, we address the appellants' challenges to 
  the fact-finding of the trial judge on a general level with reference to some 
  specific submissions to clarify our approach to these submissions and our response 
  to them. Other specific submissions challenging findings of fact will be addressed 
  in subsequent parts of these reasons. We do not pretend to address each and 
  every factual argument made by the appellants. We are, however, satisfied that 
  none of the arguments can prevail. To the very limited extent that any of these 
  submissions demonstrate factual errors in the trial judge's reasons, those errors, 
  considered separately or cumulatively, do not justify appellate intervention.</p>
<p>
  iv. The Standard of Review: Palpable and Overriding Error</p>
<p> <a name="289"></a>[289] As Cameron J.A. observed in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney 
  General), [2002] S.J. No 702 (C.A.) at para. 11: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he business of appeal - the right of appeal and the jurisdiction and powers 
  of an appellate court - is very much that of statue and hence legislative policy 
  choice&#133;.</p>
<p>
  [290] Section 6(1)(b) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 ("CJA") 
  provides for an appeal from a final order of a judge of the Superior Court of 
  Justice. Unlike other rights of appeal (e.g. s. 6(1)(a)), s. 6(1)(b) puts no 
  limitation on the grounds that may be advanced on appeal from a decision by 
  a judge of the Superior Court. Questions of fact may be raised on appeal. Section 
  134(1) of the CJA gives the appellate court wide remedial powers. Section 134(4) 
  of the CJA recognizes that an appeal court can set aside findings of fact and, 
  to a limited extent, make its own factual findings.</p>
<p>
  [291] The Legislature has chosen not to address standards of review in the CJA. 
  In the absence of any legislative pronouncement, the courts must fix the appropriate 
  scope of appellate review. In doing so, the court must balance the goal of achieving 
  justice in the individual case with the need to preserve the overall effective 
  administration of justice. Jurisprudence from this court, and more importantly, 
  from the Supreme Court of Canada, has determined that in appeals on factual 
  findings, strong deference to the findings made at trial best strikes that balance. 
  Absent statutory direction to the contrary, appellate courts must defer to all 
  findings of fact made at trial unless the court is satisfied that the finding 
  was the product of a "palpable and overriding" error. As the majority 
  in Housen v. Nikolaisen, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at 256 said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  We conclude, therefore, by emphasizing that there is one, and only one, standard 
  of review applicable to all factual conclusions made by the trial judge - that 
  of palpable and overriding error.</p>
<p>
  [292] The "palpable and overriding" standard demands strong appellate 
  deference to findings of fact made at trial. Some regard the standard as neutering 
  the appellate process and precluding the careful second hard look at the facts 
  that justice sometimes demands. This viewpoint is tenable only if facts found 
  on appeal are more likely to be accurate than those determinations made at trial. 
  If findings of fact were to be made on appeal they might be different from those 
  made at trial. Most cases that go through trial and onto appeal will involve 
  evidence open to more than one interpretation. Merely because an appellate court 
  might view the evidence differently from the trial judge and make different 
  findings is not, however, any basis for concluding that the appellate court's 
  findings will be more accurate and its result more consistent with the justice 
  of the particular case than the result achieved at trial. </p>
<p>
  [293] Whatever may be the arguments in favour of more aggressive appellate review 
  of fact-finding, the policy reasons justifying strong appellate deference are 
  powerful and have been repeatedly accepted by our highest court: see Housen 
  at 248-51. The wisdom of the policy favouring appellate deference on questions 
  of fact is evident in a case like this one. The evidence at trial occupied over 
  two hundred days. The documents fill thousands of pages. The trial judge saw 
  the witnesses and heard the evidence unfold in a narrative with a beginning, 
  a middle, and an end. Our system of litigation is predicated on the belief that 
  it is through the unfolding of the narrative in the testimony of witnesses that 
  the truth will emerge. This court is not presented with a narrative, but instead 
  with a description or summary of that narrative from the trial judge in her 
  reasons, and from counsel in their written and oral arguments. The descriptions 
  provided by counsel are not designed to tell a story, but rather to support 
  an argument. Of necessity, and in keeping with their forensic role, counsel's 
  description of the narrative at trial is selective and focuses on parts of the 
  narrative or on a particular interpretation of a part of the narrative. </p>
<p>
  [294] In a case as lengthy and factually complex as this case, appellate judges 
  are very much like the blind men in the parable of the blind men and the elephant. 
  Counsel invite the court to carefully examine isolated parts of the evidence, 
  but the court cannot possibly see and comprehend the whole of the narrative. 
  Like the inapt comparisons to the whole of the elephant made by the blind men 
  who felt only one small part of the beast, appellate fact-finding is not likely 
  to reflect an accurate appreciation of the entirety of the narrative. This case 
  demonstrates that the "palpable and overriding" standard of review 
  is a realistic reflection of the limitations and pitfalls inherent in appellate 
  fact-finding.</p>
<p>
  [295] Despite the benefit of detailed reasons for judgment, lengthy and effective 
  argument by counsel, and many hours of study, we are entirely satisfied that 
  we cannot possibly know and understand this trial record in the way that the 
  trial judge came to know and understand it. Her factual determinations are much 
  more likely to be accurate than any that we might make.</p>
<p>
  [296] The "palpable and overriding" standard addresses both the nature 
  of the factual error and its impact on the result. A "palpable" error 
  is one that is obvious, plain to see or clear: Housen at 246. Examples of "palpable" 
  factual errors include findings made in the complete absence of evidence, findings 
  made in conflict with accepted evidence, findings based on a misapprehension 
  of evidence and findings of fact drawn from primary facts that are the result 
  of speculation rather than inference. </p>
<p>
  [297] An "overriding" error is an error that is sufficiently significant 
  to vitiate the challenged finding of fact. Where the challenged finding of fact 
  is based on a constellation of findings, the conclusion that one or more of 
  those findings is founded on a "palpable" error does not automatically 
  mean that the error is also "overriding". The appellant must demonstrate 
  that the error goes to the root of the challenged finding of fact such that 
  the fact cannot safely stand in the face of that error: Schwartz v. Canada, 
  [1996] 1 S.C.R. 254 at 281. </p>
<p>
  [298] For example, the trial judge found that by the late 1970s, Chester was 
  trying to take control of IWS and push Morris out of the company. In connection 
  with that finding, she analyzed evidence of a proposed trust drawn on Chester's 
  instructions in connection with a potential estate freeze. The trial judge found 
  that under the terms of the proposed trust, Chester would gain voting control 
  of IWS and that Chester kept this fact from Morris. The appellants contend that 
  the proposed trust did not give Chester voting control over IWS while Morris 
  was alive. They submit that the trial judge misapprehended the effect of the 
  document. </p>
<p>
  [299] We think the appellants are correct in their interpretation of the trust 
  document. However, the trial judge's conclusion that the relationship between 
  Chester and Morris was changing and that Chester was forcing Morris out of the 
  IWS operation in the late 1970s was based on many findings of fact. Her erroneous 
  interpretation of the terms of the proposed trust cannot override all of the 
  other relevant factual findings she made. This error may be "palpable", 
  but is clearly not "overriding". </p>
<p>
  [300] Housen provides a detailed analysis of the "palpable and overriding" 
  standard of review. Several specific points made in that analysis have direct 
  application to the arguments advanced by the appellants. First and foremost, 
  as indicated above, the "palpable and overriding" standard applies 
  to all factual findings whether based on credibility assessments, the weighing 
  of competing evidence, expert evidence, or the drawing of inference from primary 
  facts. This court cannot retry any aspect of this case. </p>
<p>
  [301] The same deference must be shown to primary findings of fact flowing directly 
  from credibility determinations (e.g. the trial judge's finding that Chester 
  and Morris did not meet at the Trocadero restaurant to discuss the share sale 
  in 1982), the interpretation of documents (e.g. the trial judge's interpretation 
  of Morris's "notes from the grave"), or the weighing of expert evidence 
  (e.g. the expert evidence concerning the valuation of IWS as of December 1983). 
  This court must also show equal deference to findings of fact flowing from the 
  drawing of inferences from primary findings of fact (e.g. the trial judge's 
  inference from the unfavourable terms of the share sale and accompanying lease 
  that Morris did not know he entered into those agreements): Housen at 248-56; 
  Hodgkinson v. Simms, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377 at 426; Geffen v. Goodman Estate, [1991] 
  2 S.C.R. 353 at 388-89. </p>
<p>
  [302] Housen is particularly important for its treatment of the standard of 
  review as applied to the inference-drawing process at trial. The majority and 
  dissent were divided on this issue. The dissent asserted at 296: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [T]he appeal court will verify whether it [the inference] can reasonably be 
  supported by the findings of fact that the trial judge reached.&#133;</p>
<p>
  [303] The majority at 253 would not draw any distinction for the purposes of 
  appellate review between "primary" findings of fact flowing directly 
  from assessments of the credibility and reliability of evidence and secondary 
  findings of fact based on inferences drawn from the primary facts. </p>
<p class="indent"> [T]he standard of review is not to verify that the inference 
  can be reasonably supported by the findings of fact of the trial judge, but 
  whether the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in coming to a 
  factual conclusion based on accepted facts, which implies a stricter standard 
  [emphasis added].</p>
<p>
  [304] The majority in Housen explained its opposition to a standard of review 
  based on an assessment of the reasonableness of factual inferences drawn at 
  trial at 253: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [W]e find that by drawing an analytical distinction between factual findings 
  and factual inferences, the above passage [from the dissent] may lead appellate 
  courts to involve themselves in an unjustified reweighing of the evidence. Although 
  we agree that it is open to an appellate court to find that an inference of 
  fact made by the trial judge is clearly wrong, we would add the caution that 
  where evidence exists to support this inference, an appellate court will be 
  hard pressed to find a palpable and overriding error. As stated above, trial 
  courts are in an advantageous position when it comes to assessing and weighing 
  vast quantities of evidence. In making a factual inference, the trial judge 
  must sift through the relevant facts, decide on their weight, and draw a factual 
  conclusion. Thus, where evidence exists which supports this conclusion, interference 
  with this conclusion entails interference with the weight assigned by the trial 
  judge to the pieces of evidence [emphasis added].</p>
<p> [305] After Housen, appellate courts will not review findings of fact, either 
  primary or those drawn by inference, by asking whether on the totality of the 
  record, those findings are reasonable. Cases from this court such as Keljanovic 
  Estate v. Sanseverino (2000), 186 D.L.R. (4th) 481 at 488-489 (Ont. C.A.), leave 
  to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 300 and Equity Waste Management 
  of Canada v. Halton Hills (Town) (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.) must be taken 
  as overruled to the extent that they contemplate appellate review of findings 
  of fact based on an independent albeit limited appellate reassessment of the 
  reasonableness of the findings of fact made at trial.<a href="#a">[1]</a><a name="1f"></a> 
</p>
<p>
  [306] That is not to say that the approach favoured by the majority in Housen 
  will change the result of many fact-based appeals. A process which yields findings 
  of fact that cannot pass the reasonableness standard of review will almost always 
  be tainted by at least palpable error. For example, in Equity Waste Management 
  of Canada v. Halton Hills (Town), the court concluded that a finding of bad 
  faith was unreasonable on the totality of the evidence. The court also found 
  that the finding was the product of at least two palpable errors. Similarly, 
  a finding of fact based on speculation and not logical inference will be subject 
  to appellate correction not because the finding is unreasonable, although it 
  clearly is, but because a process of fact-finding based on speculation is clearly 
  wrong and, therefore, constitutes a palpable error: Rodaro v. Royal Bank of 
  Canada (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 74 at 94 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [307] The emphasis in Housen on the application of the "palpable and overriding" 
  standard to the process by which findings of fact are made moves reasons for 
  judgment to the centre of the appellate review stage. Reasons for judgment can 
  be so cryptic or incomplete as to provide little or no insight into the fact-finding 
  process. Where reasons for judgment are so deficient that they effectively deny 
  meaningful appellate review on a "palpable and overriding" standard, 
  the inadequacy of the reasons may in and of itself justify appellate intervention: 
  Sheppard, supra; R. v. Braich (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 324 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p>
  [308] While inadequate reasons may short-circuit effective appellate review 
  of fact- finding and thereby justify appellate intervention, detailed reasons 
  for judgment, which fully explain findings of fact, make the case for a rigorous 
  application of the "palpable and overriding" standard of review. Reasons 
  for judgment which lay bare the fact-finding process at trial offer ample room 
  for meaningful appellate review without resort to an evaluation of the reasonableness 
  of the findings of fact made at trial.</p>
<p>
  [309] The reasons for judgment in this case are extensive, to say the least. 
  They offer a full review of the evidence, detailed findings of fact, extensive 
  explanations for those findings, and an insight into the evolution of the trial 
  judge's thought processes as this trial proceeded. The "palpable and overriding" 
  standard of review as explained in Housen is made for reasons like those delivered 
  by this trial judge. The reasons afford the appellants a meaningful right of 
  appeal from findings of fact made at trial while at the same time demonstrating 
  the wisdom of appellate deference to those findings of fact. </p>
<p>
  v. The Appellants' "Unreasonableness" Argument</p>
<p> <a name="310"></a>[310] The appellants rely heavily on the contention that 
  this court could conduct a reasonableness review of the findings of fact made 
  at trial. In particular, Mr. Lenczner argues that this court must consider whether 
  specific findings were "reasonably supported by the evidence. Not unreasonably, 
  but reasonably." He invites the court to weigh the evidence on contested issues, 
  submitting that in most cases the evidence of Morris stood alone against the 
  evidence of many other witnesses and the contemporaneous documentation. For 
  the reasons outlined above, we do not agree that it is our function to conduct 
  an independent review of the evidence to determine whether the trial judge's 
  findings are reasonable. Rather, we must examine the reasons for "clear and 
  palpable" error.</p>
<p>
  [311] In the course of his submissions, Mr. Lenczner also advocated a much broader 
  basis for factual review. In written submissions filed in reply, he described 
  the standard of review in these terms: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If a court has doubt whether a reasonable trier of fact, acting judicially could 
  come to the conclusion the trial judge did, it must interfere. It cannot allow 
  to stand a judgment it suspects as being unsafe.</p>
<p>
  [312] This "lurking doubt" standard of review has never been accepted 
  in civil appeals. It is close to the polar opposite of the "palpable and 
  overriding" standard of review. Indeed, the "lurking doubt" standard 
  has even been rejected in criminal appeals from conviction where s. 686(1)(a)(i) 
  of the Criminal Code mandates a reasonableness review of criminal convictions: 
  R. v. Biniaris, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381. We cannot review the findings of fact against 
  this standard.</p>
<p>
  [313] Apart entirely from the various formulations of the standard of review 
  articulated by counsel for the appellants, most of their fact-based arguments 
  came down to an invitation to reweigh the evidence. As seductive as some of 
  those arguments were, this court cannot do so.</p>
<p>
  [314] Mr. Lenczner's submissions on the share sale are perhaps the best example 
  of an argument that invites reweighing of the evidence. In his factum, Mr. Lenczner 
  spent pages reviewing the evidence relevant to the alleged share sale. He went 
  over much of the same ground in his oral argument. His review of the evidence 
  was done without regard to the findings of fact made by the trial judge. Indeed, 
  much of his review assumed findings of fact that were directly contrary to those 
  made by the trial judge. For example, he referred to Morris as having admitted 
  that he knew he signed a waiver of independent legal advice at the time of the 
  alleged share sale. Morris testified that he knew no such thing and the trial 
  judge believed him. Similarly, in counsel's review of the evidence, he asserts 
  that a meeting with a representative of Lasco on December 21, 1983 to advise 
  him of the share sale was "suggested by Morris at the meeting on December 
  20". The trial judge found, based on Morris's evidence, that there was 
  no meeting on December 20th and that Morris had no knowledge of the meeting 
  with the Lasco representative. </p>
<p>
  [315] This court cannot ignore findings of fact made at trial. It must accept 
  each and every finding of fact unless it is tainted by a palpable and overriding 
  error. Much of the appellants' argument on the facts ignores the requirement 
  that appellate review take the facts as found by the trial judge unless on limited 
  review of the facts there is cause to reject those findings.</p>
<p>
  [316] The appellants present this as a case where the evidence of Morris stood 
  virtually alone against all of the other evidence. Although it is true, as the 
  trial judge observed, that there was more evidence supporting Chester's position 
  on many of the contentious issues, we do not think that the trial judge's crucial 
  findings of fact rest solely on the evidence of Morris. That is not to say that 
  if they did, they would be subject to reversal on appeal. A trial judge conducts 
  a qualitative and not a quantitative analysis of the evidence.</p>
<p>
  [317] The trial judge's ultimate preference for Morris's version of events was 
  based not on unquestioning acceptance of his evidence, but rather on a full 
  assessment of the competing versions of events and a careful consideration as 
  to the appropriate inferences to be drawn from her primary findings of fact. 
  </p>
<p>
  [318] Once again, the evidence concerning the share sale provides the best example 
  of the complex nature of the fact-finding involved in this case. Morris testified 
  that he had no idea that he signed documents purporting to sell his shares in 
  IWS to Chester. Chester and Ennis testified that the sale was the product of 
  long negotiations and that Morris knew exactly what he was signing. Clearly, 
  the trial judge had to assess the credibility of these witnesses. In doing so, 
  she had to look at the other evidence relating to the sale. Some of that evidence, 
  for example Morris's signature on many documents relating to the transaction, 
  offered potentially strong support for Chester's position. Other parts of the 
  evidence, for example the evidence that the transaction and related lease as 
  structured were grossly unfair to Morris, supported Morris's claim that he did 
  not know about the sale or the lease. Still other evidence, for example Morris's 
  conduct in the days and months following the sale, was equivocal and the inferences 
  to be drawn from it depended very much on the trial judge's credibility assessments.</p>
<p>
  [319] As the trial judge's reasons demonstrate, she was alive to the competing 
  versions of events and to the evidence of prior and subsequent events that could 
  shed light on Morris's state of knowledge. She considered all of the evidence, 
  made her credibility assessments and assigned the weight to the evidence she 
  accepted that she deemed appropriate. In the end, she accepted Morris's version 
  of events. Clearly, the mass of evidence did not all point that way. It was 
  open to the trial judge on this evidence to find that Morris did know that he 
  was signing documents referable to the share sale. Other triers of fact might, 
  as the appellants urge this court to do, have placed reliance on the contemporaneous 
  documents and found in Chester's favour. The acknowledgement that a finding 
  for Chester would have been reasonable is, however, no basis upon which this 
  court can interfere with the contrary conclusion reached by the trial judge. 
  </p>
<p>
  [320] In the course of urging this court to redo the complex fact-finding exercise 
  undertaken by the trial judge and to place more significance on certain parts 
  of the evidence than did the trial judge, the appellants contend that the trial 
  judge was obliged to make findings of credibility "in harmony with the 
  objective contemporaneous documentation". We are unaware of any evidentiary 
  hierarchy that requires a trier of fact to treat contemporaneous documents as 
  the most probative form of evidence. Clearly, that kind of documentation was 
  very important in this case. The trial judge's reasons reflect their significance. 
  She referred at length to the mass of documentation placed before her. Sometimes 
  she relied on contemporaneous documents to make findings of fact; sometimes 
  she chose to make findings of fact that were not consistent with the contemporaneous 
  documentation. For example, the trial judge relied on Linton's contemporaneous 
  notes to reject the argument that the 1981-82 bonuses to Chester's sons were 
  agreed to before the Lasco transaction and were compensation for the sons giving 
  non-competition agreements to Lasco. </p>
<p>
  [321] Where the trial judge did not give effect to contemporaneous documents, 
  she provided detailed reasons for doing so. For example, in rejecting the argument 
  that Morris's signature on the share sale documents demonstrated his knowledge 
  of the sale, the trial judge referred to and accepted Morris's evidence that 
  he habitually did not read or even look at documents presented to him for signature 
  by Chester. The trial judge further found that Chester knew that Morris would 
  not examine documents Chester gave him to sign and that Chester relied on Morris's 
  usual practice when he placed the share sale documentation before him in December 
  1983. In view of these findings, the contents of the documents signed by Morris 
  shed little, if any, light on what Morris knew about the share sale. </p>
<p>
  [322] The trial judge's acceptance of Morris's evidence that he did not read 
  the share sale documents before he signed them was crucial to the outcome of 
  the entire litigation. It is fair to say that other judges may have rejected 
  this part of Morris's evidence and concluded that he did know, at least on some 
  level, that he was selling his shares. A holding that a reasonable trier of 
  fact could have relied on the documentation is, however, far from saying that 
  the trier of fact was obliged to make findings that were consistent with the 
  documentation. The documentation was part of the evidence and had to be considered 
  along with the rest of the evidence. </p>
<p>
  [323] The appellants' submissions concerning the trial judge's interpretation 
  of Morris's "notes from the grave" provide another example where this 
  court was invited to consider the evidence afresh and draw its own conclusions 
  rather than limit itself to a review of the trial judgment for "palpable 
  and overriding" error.</p>
<p>
  [324] The notes were prepared by Morris in late January 1984 just before he 
  went into the hospital for heart surgery. The notes were left with Wiseman and 
  Taylor and were to be given to Morris's sons if he died. Morris testified that 
  when he prepared the notes in late January, he knew that he had signed documents 
  purporting to sell his shares in IWS. He was upset with the way Chester had 
  treated him and was worried about his pending surgery. According to Morris, 
  the notes reflected his confusion and distress. The appellants argued at trial 
  that the notes clearly demonstrated that Morris knew he was selling his shares 
  when he signed the documents and that he had come to regret doing so. </p>
<p>
  [325] Some of the notes are cryptic and ambiguous. Morris was examined and cross-examined 
  at length on the meaning of the various items referred to in the notes. He testified 
  that in the notes he was not distinguishing between what he knew by the end 
  of January 1984 and what he knew when he signed the documents. He offered explanations 
  for all of the items, none of which supported the appellants' contentions that 
  he knew he was selling his shares. The trial judge analyzed this evidence over 
  some sixteen pages in her reasons. She acknowledged that parts of the notes 
  could be read to support the contention that Morris knew he was selling his 
  shares in December 1983. She found, however, that "read as a whole and 
  in context" they supported Morris's contention that he did not know what 
  he signed and that he had been tricked by his brother and Ennis. In coming to 
  that conclusion, the trial judge took into consideration Morris's explanation 
  of the notes, the vague and inarticulate nature of parts of the notes and Morris's 
  description of his state of mind when he prepared the notes. </p>
<p>
  [326] The appellants do not point to any error in the trial judge's lengthy 
  review of the evidence. Instead, they renew the positions advanced at trial. 
  For example, Item 12 in the "notes from the grave" reads: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Paul [Ennis] did not explain the documents to me except to make sure I signed 
  one that exonerated him.</p>
<p>
  [327] The appellants argued at trial, and again on appeal, that this note should 
  be read as indicating that when Morris signed the document waiving independent 
  legal advice, he knew what he was doing. The trial judge read this as indicating 
  that by the time Morris wrote the "notes from the grave", he appreciated 
  that he had signed a document purporting to exonerate Ennis from any liability 
  in connection with Morris's signing of the documents. We see no palpable error 
  in accepting Morris's explanation of what he meant when he wrote the note. It 
  is not for this court to second-guess the trial judge's interpretation of the 
  note.</p>
<p>
  [328] The appellants make similar submissions on the trial judge's interpretation 
  of Item 22 in the "notes from the grave". It reads: </p>
<p class="indent">
  If I had known that the Centennial property was not included, I would not have 
  signed even under my condition.</p>
<p>
  [329] The appellants argue that this was an admission by Morris that he knew 
  he was signing documents referable to the share sale. All parties agreed that 
  this item, if read literally, made no sense. Centennial Parkway was included 
  in the purported share sale in the sense that it was owned by IWS. Morris explained 
  that in writing the note, he meant to say that he would not have signed the 
  documents had he been given any information about their contents. Some might 
  find this a strained interpretation of the words in Item 22. It was, however, 
  the trial judge's job to interpret the words. She was entitled to consider Morris's 
  explanation in coming to that interpretation. In assessing that explanation, 
  she had the benefit of seeing and hearing Morris testify for many days. She 
  could assess his facility with the English language and factor that assessment 
  into her interpretation.</p>
<p>
  [330] The appellants have failed to demonstrate that the trial judge's treatment 
  of the "notes from the grave" reveals any "palpable and overriding 
  error".</p>
<p>
  [331] In summary, this section of our reasons makes two points: first, the trial 
  judge's findings of fact and credibility must be examined not against the reasonableness 
  standard of review, but against the standard of palpable and overriding error; 
  and second, our examination of the record reveals no such error.</p>
<p>
  [332] However, we do not want to leave the impression that the appellants' attack 
  on the trial judge's findings would have succeeded had we used a reasonableness 
  standard of review. It would not. In our view, all of the trial judge's fundamental 
  findings are reasonably supported - indeed, usually amply supported - by the 
  trial record. To show this we take but one example, one we have used earlier: 
  the trial judge's finding that Morris did not know he was signing away his interest 
  in IWS or signing the accompanying lease. As we have said, other trial judges 
  might have taken a different view of the evidence, but unquestionably Morris's 
  evidence combined with the unfair terms of the sale transaction and the even 
  more unfair terms of the lease, reasonably, even amply, supported the trial 
  judge's finding.</p>
<p>
  [333] We end this section with this observation: although "reasonableness" 
  and "palpable and overriding error" are different standards of review 
  they are not entirely distinct. The application of the one may inform the application 
  of the other. So in this case, our conclusion that the trial judge's fundamental 
  findings are reasonably supported by the evidence confirms, to a large degree, 
  our principal conclusion that none of these findings is tainted by a palpable 
  and overriding error.</p>
<p>
  vi. The Processing Error Argument </p>
<p> <a name="334"></a>[334] In addition to the all-out attack on the reasonableness 
  of virtually all of the trial judge's crucial findings on the central factual 
  issues, the appellants also contend that the trial judge made innumerable processing 
  errors in the course of her reasons. The phrase "processing errors" is borrowed 
  from Keljanovic Estate v. Sanseverino, supra, at 489-90 where O'Connor J.A., 
  for the majority, said: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The second kind of error that may warrant appellate interference is what might 
  be called a "processing error", that is an error in processing the 
  evidence that leads to a finding of fact. This type of error arises when a trial 
  judge fails to appreciate the evidence relevant to a factual issue, either by 
  disregarding or misapprehending that evidence. When the appellate court finds 
  such an error it must first determine the effect of that error on the trial 
  judge's reasoning. It may interfere with the trial judge's finding if it concludes 
  that the part of the trial judge's reasoning process that was tainted by the 
  error was essential to the challenged finding of fact. </p>
<p>
  [335] The appellants argue that there was no evidence to support various findings 
  of fact made by the trial judge. Clearly, a finding of fact in the absence of 
  any evidence is a processing error of a most serious kind and constitutes a 
  palpable error. It may or may not be an overriding error: Schwartz, supra, at 
  281. </p>
<p>
  [336] Many of the "no evidence" submissions made by the appellants 
  are, on closer examination, arguments that there was not enough evidence to 
  support findings of fact made by the trial judge. The sufficiency of evidence 
  is not open to review. Two examples from the many submissions made by counsel 
  will suffice to make this point. The appellants maintain that there was no evidence 
  that Morris's health in any way affected his cognitive functions in December 
  1983 when he signed the share sale documents. In the course of their submissions, 
  the appellants, however, had to acknowledge that evidence from Shirley, Morris's 
  wife, did support the contention that Morris was distracted and unable to concentrate 
  in December 1983 because of his health concerns. Michael and Morris gave evidence 
  to the same effect. The trial judge was entitled to accept the evidence of Shirley, 
  Michael, and Morris. A finding based on that evidence cannot be characterized 
  as a finding without evidentiary support.</p>
<p>
  [337] Similarly, the appellants argue that there was no evidence to support 
  the trial judge's conclusion that Chester's sons signed the necessary consents 
  to the transfer of the SWRI shares when it was reorganized. Hayman gave evidence 
  that it was his usual practice to obtain such consents, although he had no recollection 
  of what had happened in this case. Evidence that Hayman acted in a certain way 
  in performing routine legal duties is evidence that he acted in accordance with 
  that habit on a particular occasion. That evidence of practice may not be particularly 
  strong evidence does not mean that it amounts to no evidence. </p>
<p>
  [338] Other "no evidence" submissions made by the appellants mischaracterize 
  the nature of the challenged finding of fact made by the trial judge. For example, 
  the appellants argue that there was no evidence to support the trial judge's 
  finding that Morris was not financially astute and was virtually incapable of 
  understanding complex legal and financial matters. The appellants refer to evidence 
  of many instances where Morris was very involved in complex business dealings.</p>
<p>
  [339] As Mr. Harrison, counsel for Morris, demonstrated, however, the trial 
  judge did not make the broad finding that Morris was generally incapable of 
  understanding complex business negotiations and transactions. Rather, she found 
  that insofar as the affairs of IWS were concerned, the natural abilities of 
  Chester and Morris led to a clear division of responsibility between the two 
  of them. This division of authority extended to Morris's personal finances, 
  which in his mind were not distinct from those of IWS. Chester assumed responsibility 
  for financial and legal matters. Morris was not sophisticated in such matters 
  and trusted Chester totally, leaving decisions in those realms entirely to Chester. 
  Morris assumed responsibility for overseeing the physical operation of the business. 
  The trial judge found that it was this division in authority, combined with 
  Morris's total trust in his brother that rendered Morris vulnerable to Chester's 
  deception. There was ample evidence from sources as diverse as Linton, Taylor 
  and Michael to support these findings of fact.</p>
<p>
  [340] Some of the appellants' submissions that the trial judge ignored relevant 
  evidence fail on a more basic level. Evidence that the appellants claim was 
  ignored by the trial judge was in fact referred to, often more than once, by 
  the trial judge in her reasons. These references demonstrate that the trial 
  judge did not ignore the evidence. To the contrary, she considered it and rejected 
  it as she was entitled to do. </p>
<p>
  [341] For example, Chester argued at trial that the terms of the 1983 lease 
  included IWS's assumption of potentially very significant environmental liabilities. 
  On appeal, the appellants argued that the trial judge ignored this evidence 
  when considering whether the terms of the lease made good business sense for 
  both Morris and Chester. In fact, the trial judge referred to this evidence 
  on more than one occasion and gave reasons for rejecting Chester's evidence 
  that IWS's assumption of potential environmental liabilities was part of the 
  lease arrangements. </p>
<p>
  [342] On a first reading, the trial judge's reasons are impressive in both their 
  thoroughness and lucidity. Repeated rereading of those reasons, with the benefit 
  of thirteen days of oral argument and hundreds of pages of written argument, 
  strengthens the initial impression. There is no basis for finding that the trial 
  judge made important factual findings without any evidentiary support.</p>
<p>
  [343] A second "processing error" alleged by the appellants is the 
  failure of the trial judge to consider relevant evidence. The failure to consider 
  relevant evidence can amount to a palpable error if the evidence was potentially 
  significant to a material finding of fact. The appellants bear the onus of demonstrating 
  a failure to consider such evidence. The mere absence of any reference to evidence 
  in reasons for judgment does not establish that the trial judge failed to consider 
  that evidence. The appellants must point to something in the trial record, usually 
  in the reasons, which justifies the conclusion that the trial judge failed to 
  consider certain evidence. </p>
<p>
  [344] When assessing an argument that a trial judge failed to consider relevant 
  evidence, it is helpful to begin with an overview of the reasons provided by 
  the trial judge. If that overview demonstrates a strong command of the trial 
  record and a careful analysis of evidence leading to detailed findings of fact, 
  it will be difficult for an appellant to suggest that the mere failure to refer 
  to a specific piece of evidence demonstrates a failure to consider that evidence. 
  The failure to refer to evidence in the course of careful and detailed reasons 
  for judgment suggests, not that the trial judge ignored that evidence, but rather 
  that she did not regard that evidence as significant. The reasons for judgment 
  in this case leave no doubt that the trial judge knew this record, appreciated 
  the contentious factual issues, and understood the positions of the parties 
  and the evidence they relied on. </p>
<p>
  [345] The trial judge, as she acknowledged in her reasons, did not refer to 
  all of the evidence. No one would expect her to do so. For example, in considering 
  the fairness of the lease allegedly entered into at the same time as the share 
  sale, the trial judge made no reference to a lease for the same property entered 
  into between IWS and Philip some ten years later. The appellants argue that 
  the absence of any reference to this evidence demonstrates that the trial judge 
  ignored it. We take the absence of any reference to this evidence as an indication 
  that it had no significance to the trial judge in her consideration of the business 
  efficacy of 1983 lease. This sorting of the evidentiary wheat from the chaff 
  is the essence of the trial judge's job.</p>
<p>
  [346] The appellants allege a third kind of processing error, which they describe 
  as a failure to make consistent findings of fact. For example, they argue that 
  the trial judge rejected outright the evidence of Linton wherever it assisted 
  the appellants, but accepted those parts of his evidence that offered some support 
  for Morris. As we understand this submission, the appellants argue that these 
  inconsistent conclusions demonstrate that the trial judge treated the evidence 
  differently depending on whether it helped or hurt the appellants. </p>
<p>
  [347] We reject the premise of this argument. Consistency is not necessarily 
  a hallmark of sound judicial fact-finding. Triers of fact must consider the 
  entirety of the evidence of a witness in the context of the rest of the evidence 
  that impacts on various parts of that witness's testimony. It is quite common 
  for triers of fact to accept some, but not all, of a witness's testimony. For 
  example, the trial judge accepted the part of Linton's testimony concerning 
  the 1981-82 bonuses because that testimony was supported by credible documentation 
  produced during the trial. She rejected other parts of Linton's testimony, for 
  example his evidence concerning Greycliffe, because it was inconsistent with 
  other evidence that she accepted and was not supported by the documentation. 
  The trial judge's conclusion that Linton's evidence should be accepted in some 
  areas and rejected in others not only does not reveal any processing error, 
  but also offers strong support for Mr. Harrison's contention that the trial 
  judge engaged in a careful and critical analysis of the entirety of the evidence. 
  </p>
<p>
  [348] A fourth processing error alleged by the appellants is the failure of 
  the trial judge to make what the appellants described as "essential" 
  findings of fact. In support of this submission, the appellants referred to 
  the trial judge's failure to make any finding on whether the amounts of the 
  1982 bonuses were filled in on the minute referable to those bonuses when it 
  was signed by Morris. The appellants contend that the trial judge had to make 
  a finding on this factual issue before she could properly determine whether 
  Morris knew about the bonuses. </p>
<p>
  [349] We agree with the contention that a failure to make findings of fact that 
  are essential to the ultimate determination of the issues in dispute amounts 
  to a palpable and overriding error. We disagree, however, that the finding referred 
  to above was an essential finding of fact. There was no evidence before the 
  trial judge concerning the circumstances in which the minute was signed or the 
  contents of the minute when it was signed. Morris, while acknowledging his signature, 
  had no idea when and how he came to sign it. Neither Chester nor any of his 
  witnesses gave any evidence about the circumstances surrounding the signing 
  of the minute or its condition when it was signed. On the state of the evidence, 
  and of course depending on her credibility assessments, it was open to the trial 
  judge to conclude that whether or not the amounts were on the document when 
  it was signed, Morris did not know about the bonuses. Indeed, on the evidence 
  that she found credible, there was no basis upon which she could come to any 
  conclusion on whether the amounts had been filled in on the minute before it 
  was signed by Morris.</p>
<p>
  [350] A fifth processing error relied on by the appellants arises out of the 
  trial judge's alleged misuse of her rejection of evidence given by Chester and 
  others in support of Chester. The appellants contend that the trial judge used 
  the rejection of that evidence as evidence of the contrary facts. For example, 
  Ennis and Chester testified that they were unaware of any medical problems that 
  Morris was having in the fall of 1983. The trial judge rejected this evidence, 
  but according to the appellants went on to use the rejection of this evidence 
  as evidence that they in fact knew that he had serious medical problems in the 
  fall of 1983. </p>
<p>
  [351] Evidence that is rejected by the trier of fact has no evidentiary value 
  and cannot be used as a basis for findings of fact: R. v. Hibbert (2002), 163 
  C.C.C. (3d) 129 at 148-52 (S.C.C.); R. v. O'Connor (2002), 170 C.C.C. (3d) 365 
  at 374-77 (Ont. C.A.). It would have been palpable error had the trial judge 
  used the rejection of evidence given by Chester and Ennis as a basis for a finding 
  that they knew Morris's health was precarious in the fall of 1983. There was, 
  however, ample evidence from other sources to support that finding. Members 
  of Morris's family and at least one other business associate gave evidence of 
  Morris's obvious ill health in the fall of 1983. Morris fainted and had to be 
  taken to the hospital in October 1983. Chester was aware of this incident. It 
  was open to the trial judge, in the face of the evidence that Morris met and 
  dealt with Chester and Ennis on a daily basis, to conclude that what was obvious 
  to others concerning Morris's health would also be obvious to Ennis and Chester. 
  This evidence provided ample support for the trial judge's finding at para. 
  641 that: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Morris's health problems were becoming more evident in the fall of 1983. Chester 
  knew Morris was feeling the strain both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>
  [352] The rejection of the contrary evidence offered by Chester and Ennis, of 
  course, made it easier for the trial judge to draw the inferences she did from 
  the evidence she accepted. </p>
<p>
  [353] Mr. Lenczner also argues that the trial judge used her rejection of Chester's 
  explanation for not obtaining an independent valuation of the IWS shares before 
  the share sale as positive evidence that Chester did not obtain that valuation 
  because it would have brought the previous bonuses and profit diversions to 
  Morris's attention. Mr. Lenczner argues that this is another instance in which 
  the trial judge used the rejection of evidence as the basis for a finding of 
  fact. </p>
<p>
  [354] We do not agree with this submission. It was common ground that no independent 
  valuation of IWS was obtained in connection with the share sale, although one 
  had been obtained earlier in connection with the possible estate freeze. The 
  question for the trial judge was what inference, if any, should be drawn from 
  the absence of an independent valuation? Chester's evidence that there was no 
  need for an independent valuation because he and Morris knew the value of IWS 
  was rejected by the trial judge as an explanation for not obtaining an independent 
  valuation. She was left to decide what inference should be drawn from the absence 
  of any valuation without regard to Chester's rejected explanation. There was 
  evidence that Linton had warned Chester as early as February 1982 that the bonuses 
  might not survive outside scrutiny. In assessing what inference to draw from 
  the absence of any independent valuation, the trial judge was also entitled 
  to consider the evidence, which she accepted, that the amount paid to Morris 
  for his shares was well below fair market value. This evidence supported the 
  inference that an independent valuation might well bring to light matters that 
  Chester preferred left in the dark. The inference which the trial judge drew 
  from the absence of an independent valuation of the IWS shares flowed from the 
  evidence she accepted, not from her rejection of Chester's evidence.</p>
<p>
  [355] Although evidence rejected as unworthy of belief has no evidentiary value, 
  a finding that a party has fabricated evidence can be used as evidence against 
  that party. The trier of fact cannot infer fabrication simply because evidence 
  is rejected as untrue. There must be evidence of fabrication: R. v. O'Connor, 
  supra.</p>
<p>
  [356] The trial judge found that Chester and Robert fabricated evidence. For 
  example, Chester alleged that he gave a cheque for $1 million to Morris in connection 
  with the share sale on January 4, 1984. To support that evidence, he produced 
  a carbon copy of a bank deposit slip showing a deposit of $1 million into Morris's 
  account. The trial judge concluded that the deposit slip was a forgery. She 
  gave reasons for that conclusion, which included (1) the absence of any other 
  supporting banking documentation, although Chester, through IWS, had possession 
  of Morris's banking records until well after the litigation began, and (2) Taylor's 
  evidence that Morris deposited a $500,000 cheque from IWS and not a $1 million 
  cheque from Chester into his account on January 4, 1984. </p>
<p>
  [357] The evidence accepted by the trial judge permitted the inference that 
  the bank deposit slip was forged. That finding, considered in conjunction with 
  the other relevant findings, permitted both a rejection of Chester's evidence 
  as untrue and a finding that he did not make a $1 million payment to Morris 
  on January 4, 1984.</p>
<p>
  [358] No trial of this length and complexity will ever be error-free. Cloistered 
  appellate counsel with months to pour over the trial record will find mistakes 
  in the trial judge's processing of the evidence. We are satisfied, however, 
  that none of those uncovered on this appeal rises to the level of "palpable 
  and overriding" error. </p>
<p>
  vii. Alleged Errors in Credibility Assessments</p>
<p> <a name="359"></a>[359] Although the "palpable and overriding" standard of 
  review applies to all factual findings, Housen, at 254-55 recognizes that findings 
  of fact grounded in credibility assessments will be particularly difficult to 
  disturb on appeal. Credibility assessments are inherently partly subjective 
  and reflect the life experience of individual judges and their own perception 
  of how the world works. Credibility assessments are also grounded in numerous, 
  often unstated considerations which only the trial judge can appreciate and 
  calibrate. </p>
<p>
  [360] Deference to the findings of credibility includes giving full force and 
  effect to those findings. An allegation that a trial judge has made a palpable 
  and overriding error in assessing a witness's credibility can only be evaluated 
  by examining the entirety of the record touching on that credibility assessment. 
  Where a trial judge advances several reasons for rejecting a witness's testimony 
  in its entirety as incredible, a demonstrated error in relation to just one 
  of those reasons will not necessarily warrant reversal of the credibility assessment.</p>
<p>
  [361] The trial judge's assessment of Robert's credibility makes this point. 
  The trial judge disbelieved Robert's evidence on virtually every contentious 
  issue. On her findings, Robert's conduct from the middle of 1988 forward was 
  thoroughly dishonest. Her rejection of his evidence reflects the cumulative 
  assessment of his credibility.</p>
<p>
  [362] The appellants fasten on the trial judge's disbelief of Robert's evidence 
  that he did not remove documents from Hayman's file on SWRI. In making this 
  specific credibility finding, the trial judge relied on a single, ambiguous 
  answer given by Robert in cross-examination as evidence that he admitted he 
  may have removed the documents. We think she misapprehended this evidence. We 
  are, however, satisfied that this mistake had no effect on her overall assessment 
  of Robert's credibility or her findings of fact. Even if she was wrong in finding 
  that Robert removed the documents, this did not affect her findings that the 
  documents existed and at some point had been removed from the file. </p>
<p>
  [363] In disbelieving Robert on virtually every significant fact, the trial 
  judge relied on her finding that Robert had stolen documents, forged documents 
  to induce Philip to breach its contract with SWRI, and had failed to produce 
  and perhaps destroyed relevant Greycliffe documentation. We have no doubt that 
  she would have arrived at exactly the same position on Robert's credibility 
  had she not misunderstood his answer concerning the removal of documentation 
  from Hayman's file. A single isolated misapprehension of one bit of the evidence 
  does not justify interfering with the trial judge's rejection of Robert's evidence 
  as incredible on issues as diverse as the payment of the bonuses, the operation 
  of Greycliffe, and the operation of SWRI. </p>
<p>
  [364] Although credibility assessments, especially powerful ones such as those 
  made in this case, are difficult to reverse on appeal, they are not immune from 
  appellate review. For example, a credibility finding that is arbitrary in that 
  it is based on an irrelevant consideration or tainted by a processing error 
  can be set aside on appeal. </p>
<p>
  [365] The appellants contend that several of the trial judge's findings of credibility 
  reflect these kinds of errors. We reject those submissions. For the most part, 
  these arguments reflect a misapprehension of what the trial judge said or refer 
  only to part of the basis upon which the trial judge made the challenged finding 
  of credibility. </p>
<p>
  [366] For example, the appellants contend that Kumer's evidence was found to 
  be unreliable based entirely on the fact that Chester had provided financial 
  assistance to Kumer in 1979-80 when he was having trouble with the tax department. 
  The appellants submit that the trial judge found that because Kumer received 
  this assistance in 1979, he was prepared to lie in his testimony for Chester 
  many years later. Counsel refer to this finding of credibility as "irresponsible" 
  and arbitrary. </p>
<p>
  [367] Assuming that a disbelief of Kumer based entirely on the financial assistance 
  provided some years earlier by Chester would constitute an arbitrary finding 
  of credibility, that is not what the trial judge did. Kumer, like Chester and 
  his sons, gave evidence that the 1981-82 bonuses to Chester's sons had their 
  genesis before the completion of the Lasco transaction in 1980 and provided 
  compensation for the boys in exchange for their non-competition agreements. 
  The trial judge concluded, primarily on the basis of the evidence of Linton 
  and certain documents produced for the first time during the trial, that the 
  decision to pay these bonuses post-dated the Lasco transaction and had nothing 
  to do with the non-competition clauses. This finding was open to the trial judge 
  and was buttressed by the evidence of Morris and the common sense observation 
  that Chester's young sons hardly seemed entitled to half of the profits realized 
  from the sale of two divisions of a company built by the combined lifetime efforts 
  of Chester and Morris.</p>
<p>
  [368] Having found that Kumer lent his voice to a fabricated explanation for 
  the 1981-82 bonuses, the trial judge rejected his evidence as unreliable. She 
  rejected his evidence not only as it related to the 1981-82 bonuses, but also 
  as it related to other material matters in dispute such as Morris's knowledge 
  of the relationship between Greycliffe and IWS. Rejection of the entirety of 
  the contentious parts of a witness's evidence based on a finding of a single 
  material, deliberate falsehood is not arbitrary. Juries are routinely told that 
  they may reject a witness's evidence in its entirety if they are satisfied that 
  that witness has deliberately lied to them on a material matter. </p>
<p>
  [369] The appellants allege various other processing errors, which they say 
  undermine all of the crucial credibility findings. Various combinations of processing 
  errors are put forward in relation to various credibility findings. We do not 
  propose to address each and every one of these arguments. Mr. Lenczner's detailed 
  submissions directed at the trial judge's rejection of Wiseman's evidence concerning 
  his alleged discussions with Morris between December 26, 1983 and the end of 
  1983 are typical of this category of the appellants' arguments. We will address 
  those submissions in some detail. </p>
<p>
  [370] Wiseman testified that Morris told him on December 26th that he had sold 
  his shares to Chester. Morris was upset. According to Wiseman, he and Morris 
  discussed the sale on several occasions between December 26th and the end of 
  the year. Wiseman further testified that Morris produced the share sale documents 
  on December 28th and that he, Morris, and Taylor went over the documents. </p>
<p>
  [371] Morris denied that he had any discussions with Wiseman concerning the 
  share sale before the end of 1983. On his evidence, he only became aware of 
  the share sale in early 1984. He testified that he did not see the share sale 
  documents until much later.</p>
<p> [372] The trial judge rejected this part of Wiseman's evidence. In doing so, 
  she referred to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the inconsistencies between his trial testimony and his discovery;</li>
  <li>an inconsistency between his trial testimony and an affidavit he swore in 
    October 1988; and</li>
  <li>the inconsistency between his trial testimony and a notation on the October 
    1988 affidavit. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  [373] Mr. Lenczner contends that the trial judge's rejection of Wiseman's evidence 
  has no proper foundation in the record. He argues that the inconsistencies are 
  so trivial as to be non-existent, that the finding ignores Wiseman's status 
  as a "professional" and finally, that the notation referred to by 
  the trial judge on the October 1988 affidavit was not made by Wiseman and, therefore, 
  could have no relevance to his credibility.</p>
<p>
  [374] Mr. Harrison responds that the trial judge's rejection of this part of 
  Wiseman's evidence is not only free from any palpable and overriding error, 
  but is also firmly rooted in the evidence. He begins with the sound proposition 
  that one's status as a "professional" does not permit any presumption 
  about the credibility of that person's evidence. He then submits that Wiseman 
  testified at trial that Morris gave him the share sale on December 28, 1983. 
  His trial testimony was very specific. At discovery, Wiseman was much less certain 
  as to when he received these documents. In his October 1988 affidavit, he said 
  that he had received them "in about January 1984". </p>
<p>
  [375] Mr. Harrison argues that these answers reveal inconsistencies that were 
  potentially significant. In any event, he submits that the significance of the 
  inconsistencies was for the trial judge and not this court. </p>
<p>
  [376] Mr. Harrison does not suggest that the notation on the October 1988 affidavit 
  could assist in assessing Wiseman's credibility. Wiseman was not the author 
  of the notation. To this very limited extent, the trial judge's reasons are 
  in error, although it must be said that it is not at all clear that the trial 
  judge relied on the notation in assessing Wiseman's credibility. </p>
<p>
  [377] Mr. Harrison further contends that in considering whether the trial judge's 
  rejection of Wiseman's evidence reveals "palpable and overriding" 
  error, this court must look beyond the factors specifically referred to by the 
  trial judge in rejecting that part of Wiseman's evidence. Mr. Harrison says 
  that the court must look to the evidence accepted by the trial judge. He refers 
  to Taylor's evidence denying any meeting on December 28th and to the unchallenged 
  evidence that Morris went into the hospital for an angiogram on December 28th 
  and was indisposed for several days. Mr. Harrison submits that this evidence 
  was accepted by the trial judge and that Wiseman's evidence concerning the events 
  between December 26th and the end of the year simply cannot stand with that 
  evidence.</p>
<p>
  [378] Lastly, Mr. Harrison urges the court to have regard to the trial judge's 
  overall assessment of Wiseman's credibility in considering whether her credibility 
  finding on one part of his evidence reveals "palpable and overriding" 
  error. For example, based on the evidence of Ray Harris, an expert called by 
  Taylor Leibow, the trial judge found that Wiseman was not being truthful when 
  he attempted to explain why he had not included a related party note for Greycliffe 
  in the 1982 IWS financial statement. Mr. Harrison submits that having found 
  that Wiseman engaged in a deliberate falsehood on a material issue, it was entirely 
  appropriate for the trial judge to take a negative view of his credibility on 
  other material issues, especially where that evidence was contradicted by witnesses, 
  like Taylor, whose overall credibility was accepted by the trial judge.</p>
<p> [379] The competing arguments with respect to the trial judge's finding that 
  Wiseman's evidence was not credible as it related to the events between December 
  26 and December 31, 1983 demonstrate the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The trial judge had a difficult credibility assessment to make. There were 
    reasons to believe Wiseman's testimony and there were reasons to question 
    his credibility.</li>
  <li>Counsel diligently and effectively presented the competing positions before 
    the trial judge.</li>
  <li>The trial judge had a firm grasp of the trial record and the positions of 
    the parties. Any deficiencies in her recollection or understanding of the 
    evidence were insignificant.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [380] In the end, we see no reason to interfere with her assessment of Wiseman's 
  credibility, or her many other similar assessments. There was nothing arbitrary 
  about her assessment, it did not reflect any significant misapprehension of 
  the evidence, and it was not the product of an unfair balancing of the relevant 
  credibility considerations. This trial judge may have attached more or less 
  significance to certain factors going to the witnesses's credibility than other 
  trial judges. It was her responsibility to decide how much weight should be 
  given to the various factors. We are being asked to recalibrate her assessment 
  of those factors. We cannot do so.</p>
<p>
  [381] The appellants have not demonstrated any basis on which this court can 
  interfere with the powerful credibility assessments made by the trial judge. 
  </p>
<p>
  B. The Grounds of Appeal in the Main Action</p>
<p>
  i. Factual Issues in the Main Action </p>
<p> <a name="382"></a>[382] We turn now from the appellants' broad attacks to 
  their specific challenges to the core findings of fact in the main action. These 
  arise in the five most important episodes in the relationship between Morris 
  and Chester, which were so carefully scrutinized in the main action. We have 
  already dealt with a number of these challenged findings in addressing the appellants' 
  broad arguments. We do so again in order to address the specific challenges 
  raised by the appellants. </p>
<p>
  [383] The first episode concerned the 1979 bonuses. The trial judge found Chester 
  liable to Morris both for breach of fiduciary duty and, together with IWS, under 
  s. 248 of the OBCA in connection with the 1979 bonuses. Judgment was granted 
  against Chester and IWS for $125,000. Morris was also granted a tracing order 
  to determine whether any of the $125,000 in bonuses declared in 1979 remains 
  in the hands of persons other than a bona fide purchaser for value. In this 
  connection (as with the other tracing orders made), the trial judge declared 
  that Chester's sons, Robert, Warren, and Gary, are not bona fide purchasers 
  for value.</p>
<p>
  [384] The second episode concerned the 1981 and 1982 bonuses. The trial judge 
  found Chester liable to Morris for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with 
  those bonuses. She found Chester and IWS liable to Morris under s. 248 of the 
  OBCA. She also found Chester's sons liable to Morris under s. 248 and for knowing 
  receipt of the bonus monies they each received for these two years.</p>
<p>
  [385] She quantified the relief against Chester and IWS at $2,312,000, which 
  represents Morris's fifty per cent of the bonuses declared for those two years 
  less the amount Morris actually received as bonus monies for these years. She 
  also ordered that Morris could trace the bonus payments and recover them by 
  a constructive trust or personally against Chester and IWS. She ordered Chester's 
  sons to pay to Morris the sums of $622,000, $936,000 and $500,000 respectively, 
  provided that ultimately Morris recovered no more than $2,312,000 in connection 
  with the bonuses for these two years.</p>
<p>
  [386] The third episode, and by far the most important, was the agreement that 
  Chester said he made with Morris in December 1983 to buy Morris's shares in 
  IWS. The trial judge found that Chester's actions in this connection made him 
  liable to Morris for breach of fiduciary duty, undue influence, unconscionability 
  and pursuant to s. 248 of the OBCA. She also found IWS liable to Morris pursuant 
  to s. 248. </p>
<p>
  [387] By way of remedy, the trial judge ordered that Chester held these shares 
  on constructive trust for Morris from December 22, 1983 onward, and she ordered 
  that they be transferred to Morris as of June 27, 2002, the date of the trial 
  judgment. She also ordered that Morris's lost profits during the period of constructive 
  trust be quantified and that Morris is entitled to judgment against Chester 
  and IWS for this amount or to trace these profits into the hands of persons 
  other than a bona fide purchase for value without notice.</p>
<p>
  [388] In this episode, the trial judge also dealt with the lease to IWS signed 
  in December 1983 as part of the share sale. She found Chester liable to Morris 
  and Morriston for breach of fiduciary duty, undue influence, and unconscionability 
  in connection with that lease. She also found both Chester and IWS liable to 
  Morris and Morriston under s. 248 of the OBCA. However, given that the loss 
  to Morris and Morriston from this lease constituted a gain to IWS and that she 
  had restored Morris to his ownership position in IWS, the trial judge did not 
  order a separate remedy based on the lease.</p>
<p>
  [389] The fourth episode addressed the profit diversions. The trial judge found 
  Chester liable to Morris for breach of fiduciary duty, knowing assistance, and 
  under s. 248 of the OBCA in connection with the profits diverted from IWS to 
  Greycliffe and four other companies through which Robert provided trucking services 
  to IWS. She also found IWS, Robert, and Robert's companies liable to Morris 
  under s. 248. She quantified Morris's fifty per cent of these profit diversions 
  at $1,180,073 and ordered personal judgment in this amount against Chester, 
  IWS, and Robert. She also ordered judgment against Robert's companies in the 
  amounts of the profits diverted to them. She granted Morris a tracing order 
  in connection with these diversions. </p>
<p>
  [390] The final episode involves the Ancaster property. The trial judge found 
  Chester liable to Morris for breach of contract in connection with the Ancaster 
  property and awarded Morris damages of $98,000.</p>
<p>
  [391] Our evaluation of the appellants' specific attack on the fact-finding 
  by the trial judge must be made in the context of the proper role of appellate 
  review of facts as found at trial, which we have already described. The appellants 
  argue that the trial judge was palpably wrong in her assessment of Morris, and 
  in determining the fundamental facts that underpinned her conclusions in each 
  of the episodes we have just outlined. We will deal with each of these episodes 
  in turn.</p>
<p>
  (a) Morris's Financial Abilities</p>
<p> <a name="392"></a>[392] The appellants' attack is the finding, made in a number 
  of different ways, that Morris had a relative lack of sophistication in financial 
  matters. The appellants contend that the evidence compelled the opposite conclusion 
  and that, given his financial astuteness, Morris surely knew he was agreeing 
  to the bonus allocations, the share sale including the lease, and the profit 
  diversions to Robert's companies.</p>
<p>
  [393] Although there was evidence from which the trial judge might have drawn 
  the conclusion urged by the appellants, there was clearly ample evidence to 
  sustain the conclusion that she reached. There is no doubt that Chester, not 
  Morris, ran the financial affairs of IWS. Taylor, the company's accountant, 
  dealt with Chester, not Morris, regarding such matters. Linton, the company 
  comptroller, did the same and knew that Morris had no interest in or understanding 
  of corporate tax matters. Others carried on aspects of Morris's personal banking 
  for him. Michael testified about his father's limitations in this area. Indeed, 
  Morris did so himself. Most importantly, the trial judge heard evidence over 
  fifteen months that painted a picture of Morris's business abilities. She heard 
  Morris testify over almost twenty-five days about many subjects that necessarily 
  revealed his limited financial abilities. She was uniquely placed to draw the 
  conclusion she did. It is not palpable error; indeed it is well-founded. </p>
<p>
  (b) The 1979 Bonuses</p>
<p> <a name="394"></a>[394] The appellants attack the basic findings of the trial 
  judge concerning the 1979 bonuses, namely that Chester had never discussed them 
  with Morris, and that Morris never agreed to them and indeed was unaware of 
  them. The appellants point to Chester's evidence (that he discussed the 1979 
  bonuses with Morris and they agreed by early 1980 at the latest that all $250,000 
  would go to Chester's sons) and Morris's signature in three places on the 1979 
  bonus minute as necessitating the opposite finding. </p>
<p>
  [395] However, Chester's version of events was contradicted by contemporaneous 
  documentation produced by Linton and Ennis, which made clear that the 1979 bonuses 
  were the result of a reallocation of a prior allocation of those bonuses and 
  that this reallocation was not made until April 1981.</p>
<p>
  [396] Moreover, Morris said he did not know about the 1979 bonuses until after 
  the litigation began. His view that he and his brother should be building the 
  company for the equal benefit of his sons and Chester's sons was entirely inconsistent 
  with his agreeing to the 1979 bonuses going entirely to Chester's sons as Chester 
  alleged. As to his signature on the bonus minute, there was ample evidence of 
  Morris's practice of signing corporate documents brought to him by Chester without 
  reading them, which is exactly what he said happened in this instance.</p>
<p>
  [397] In all the circumstances, the conclusion of the trial judge that Morris 
  neither knew about nor agreed to the 1979 bonuses is not palpably wrong. It 
  is eminently supportable.</p>
<p>
  (c) The 1981 and 1982 Bonuses</p>
<p> <a name="398"></a>[398] One of the main issues in this action involves the 
  bonuses allocated and paid by IWS for 1981 and 1982. These bonuses totaled $6.6 
  million: $3.3 million for each of the two years. For each of these two years, 
  Morris and Chester were each to receive $700,000 and Chester's sons, Warren, 
  Robert and Gary were to receive $550,000, $600,000 and $500,000 respectively.</p>
<p>
  [399] The appellants do not contest the trial judge's finding that this $6.6 
  million represented the proceeds of two sales by IWS in which it sold its refuse 
  division and its ferrous division. However, their fundamental challenge is to 
  the findings that Morris did not know about these allocations, had no discussions 
  with Chester about them and did not agree to them. The appellants argue that 
  these findings fly in the face of the evidence of Chester, his sons, and his 
  brother-in-law, Kumer, and most importantly the two corporate minutes recording 
  the allocations for these years. Morris signed each minute in three places. 
  The appellants contend that the findings are palpably wrong and must be reversed, 
  thus sustaining the validity of the bonuses. </p>
<p>
  [400] We disagree with the appellants. There was ample evidence supporting the 
  trial judge's findings and contradicting the story told by Chester, his sons 
  and Kumer. That story was that the bonus allocations were all discussed with 
  Morris and settled before the closing of the sale of the ferrous division in 
  September 1981. However, Linton's evidence, supported by contemporaneous documentation 
  from both himself and Ennis, made clear that the idea for the final allocation 
  of these bonuses originated with Linton, not Chester, and was not raised until 
  October or early November 1981. Although he discussed the idea with Chester, 
  he never did so with Morris.</p>
<p>
  [401] Although Morris acknowledged his signatures on the corporate minutes, 
  he could not recall signing them. His evidence was that he did not read the 
  minutes, no one told him about the bonus allocations, and he did not agree to 
  them. The trial judge accepted this. In our view, it was clearly open to her 
  to do so.</p>
<p>
  [402] In addition to Morris's own evidence, there was evidence of his pattern 
  of signing corporate documents in the appropriate place when asked to do so, 
  but without reading their contents. There was evidence from Wiseman that when 
  he told Morris about the 1981 and 1982 bonuses in early 1985, he believed that 
  Morris was learning of this for the first time. Moreover, there was the fact 
  that Morris raised no complaint about the allocations until 1985, which was 
  completely inconsistent with his knowing about them at the time. It is inconceivable 
  that Morris would have accepted, without protest, a distribution of the proceeds 
  of the sale of two divisions created in large part through his own efforts where 
  the allocation was so skewed towards Chester and his sons.</p>
<p>
  [403] The appellants rely heavily on Morris's signatures on the two corporate 
  minutes to demonstrate that Morris must have known of these bonus allocations. 
  However, there was no evidence from anyone about the circumstances under which 
  Morris signed. The trial judge could not know whether he was hurried and distracted 
  and simply followed his previous pattern of signing corporate documents or whether 
  he had time to calmly review the corporate minutes. The corporate signatures 
  themselves, even where the allocations are on the same page an inch or two above 
  those signatures as in the 1981 minutes, do not compel the conclusion that Morris 
  knew of them, let alone agreed to them.</p>
<p>
  [404] In summary, there was a clear evidentiary foundation for the trial judge's 
  findings about Morris's lack of knowledge of these bonus allocations. She made 
  no palpable error in making them. </p>
<p>
  [405] The appellants also quarrel with the trial judge's finding that these 
  bonuses were a distribution of shareholder equity arising from the sale of the 
  two divisions of the company and the further finding that there was no valid 
  business reason for allocating millions of dollars to Chester's sons. However, 
  here again there was significant evidence in support of these findings. Linton 
  said exactly this in his testimony: he could see nothing to justify these bonuses 
  to Chester's sons. The divisions that were sold had been built over forty years. 
  Chester's sons were young men in their mid-twenties who had been with IWS for 
  relatively short periods of time and for whom these bonuses represented exorbitant 
  payments. The trial judge was perfectly justified in concluding that neither 
  their services nor the non-competition agreements they signed as part of the 
  two sales warranted these payments. She was equally justified in finding that 
  these bonuses represented a distribution of shareholder equity. </p>
<p>
  [406] In short, we conclude that the fact-finding of the trial judge in connection 
  with the 1981 and 1982 bonuses is well-founded and does not constitute palpable 
  and overriding error.</p>
<p>
  (d) The Share Sale and Lease</p>
<p> <a name="407"></a>[407] The share sale and the trial judge's findings of fact 
  in connection with it are at the heart of this appeal.</p>
<p>
  [408] The trial judge's core conclusion is that Morris did not participate in 
  any negotiations to sell his shares and had no idea, when he was asked to sign 
  the documents on December 22, 1983, that he was selling his shares or signing 
  a lease. The appellants attack these findings and argue that they must be set 
  aside and indeed reversed.</p>
<p>
  [409] The trial judge came to these conclusions in the context of a very careful 
  and detailed review of the evidence about the share sale and its aftermath. 
  That evidence covered the seven years from 1982 to 1989. Her review, complete 
  with numerous footnoted references to the evidence, encompasses some 740 paragraphs 
  and 190 pages of her reasons for judgment as reported. In evaluating the appellants' 
  attack on the trial judge's findings, three considerations, which we have already 
  discussed in detail, must be kept in mind.</p>
<p>
  [410] First, as with every other major episode in this very long trial, the 
  trial judge was presented with two starkly different versions of events. </p>
<p>
  [411] Chester, supported by Ennis, said that he and Morris negotiated the terms 
  of the share sale over a series of meetings running from the summer of 1982 
  through to December of 1983. Morris then executed the agreements at two meetings 
  on December 20 and 22, 1983 at which the documents were reviewed in detail. 
  Thereafter, for a number of years, Morris conducted himself in a way that revealed 
  that he was fully cognizant of the deal when he signed and that this conduct 
  also constituted his ratification of it. </p>
<p>
  [412] On the other hand, Morris said that he had no negotiations with his brother 
  concerning the sale of his shares. When he was asked to go to Ennis's office 
  on December 22, 1983 he was distracted by his own health problems and his imminent 
  angiogram. He assumed that he was simply being requested to sign routine corporate 
  documents. Receiving no contrary explanation, he signed as he was asked, without 
  reading the documents, just as he had done many times before. Only on January 
  5, 1984 did he learn what the documents contained and thereafter he consistently 
  and vehemently told his brother that he had to straighten out what had happened 
  and restore Morris's fifty per cent ownership of the company.</p>
<p>
  [413] The fact-finding required of the trial judge was thus necessarily shaped 
  by the parties, presenting as they did these fundamentally contradictory scenarios. 
  In determining the facts surrounding the share sale, any choice of a third scenario 
  lying between these stark alternatives would have faced the practical difficulty 
  that neither side was saying that it happened that way. Indeed, Mr. Lenczner 
  argued that this court (and therefore presumably the trial judge) could not 
  determine that the truth lay somewhere between the two alternatives - for example 
  that although there had been no negotiations, at some level Morris knew on December 
  22nd that he was signing away his shares. He submitted that to find these to 
  be the facts and attach legal consequences to them would deprive Chester of 
  due process since Morris had not pleaded his case on this basis. Thus, while 
  the trial judge was certainly not bound to choose one story or the other, the 
  way the evidence about the share sale was presented is a relevant factor in 
  considering whether her finding that it happened as Morris described was palpably 
  wrong.</p>
<p>
  [414] Second, in making her fundamental findings, the trial judge was also guided 
  by her overall credibility assessments of the major witnesses. These assessments 
  were reached over the fifteen months of the trial and, with Morris and Chester, 
  after seeing each of them in the witness box for a number of days. Particularly 
  in connection with the share sale, much of her task required her to weigh Morris's 
  word against Chester's. The trial judge was left with no doubt in her general 
  assessment of their credibility: overall, she found that Morris was credible 
  and Chester was not. Indeed, by the end of the trial she had concluded that 
  Chester had fabricated much of his story.</p>
<p>
  [415] Third, it must be remembered that this trial addressed a number of episodes 
  in the relationship between these two brothers. While the share sale was by 
  far the most significant, other episodes preceded it, such as the 1981-82 bonuses, 
  and episodes that followed it, such as the story of SWRI. The facts as found 
  by the trial judge reflect a significant degree of consistency in the behaviour 
  of the principal actors throughout all of these episodes. The overall picture 
  that emerges is one into which each episode fits coherently. The holistic nature 
  of fact-finding in a complex trial such as this, with its many interrelated 
  episodes, makes more difficult the finding of a palpable error at the core of 
  any one episode taken in isolation. The appellants implicitly recognize this 
  in asking that we find palpable error and reverse the fundamental findings of 
  fact not just in the share sale episode, but in all the other episodes as well. 
  </p>
<p>
  [416] These general considerations must be kept in mind in considering the appellants' 
  position that the trial judge's fundamental finding concerning the share sale 
  constituted palpable and overriding error.</p>
<p>
  [417] The trial judge accepted Morris's evidence that there were no negotiations 
  and that on December 22, 1983 he thought he was signing corporate documents 
  in the ordinary course, not selling his shares to his brother.</p>
<p>
  [418] The appellants argue that this finding cannot stand in the face of Chester's 
  evidence, supported by Ennis, of substantial negotiations initiated by Morris 
  leading to the execution of the agreement at two meetings on December 20th and 
  December 22nd, and in the face of Morris's repeated signatures on the sale documents 
  and Morris's own statements. The appellants contend that this evidence, taken 
  together with Morris's conduct over the ensuing five years, require the setting 
  aside of this finding and compel the conclusion that Morris knew he was selling 
  his shares and is bound by his signature. </p>
<p>
  [419] We do not agree. For a number of reasons, in addition to the general considerations 
  we have just outlined, it was open to the trial judge to accept Morris's version 
  of what happened.</p>
<p>
  [420] The trial judge's conclusion reflects her general assessment of Morris's 
  credibility. As we have already discussed, that assessment must be respected 
  in this court. Over the course of this very lengthy trial and with ample opportunity 
  to form her view, she found him a truthful witness. She acknowledged that she 
  began with an initial skepticism about Morris's professed lack of knowledge 
  of events, but as the trial unfolded and as she listened to the appellants' 
  version of events, this skepticism dissipated. She gave a number of examples 
  of instances where little and seemingly unlikely details of Morris's evidence 
  were borne out in ways he could not have predicted. In the end, her conclusion 
  about Morris's credibility was careful and considered, and based on reasoning 
  that withstands scrutiny. This is just the kind of finding that attracts very 
  significant deference in this court.</p>
<p>
  [421] Beyond the general assessment of Morris's credibility, his version of 
  events was also consistent with his clear and lifelong aspiration to pass the 
  business on to the next generation. For his part, that meant his sons, Michael 
  and Douglas. For Morris to negotiate and conclude the sale of his shares to 
  his brother would have been entirely inconsistent with his fundamental objective. 
  This reality strengthens the soundness of the trial judge's finding. </p>
<p>
  [422] Equally, the trial judge's analysis of the manifest unfairness of the 
  share sale provides important support for her findings about what happened. 
  The trial judge found that in December 1983 the shares of the company were conservatively 
  worth $8.735 to $8.963 million, apart from the $1 million dividend declared 
  in 1983 to fund the share sale. The fair market value of Morris's fifty per 
  cent interest would therefore have been about $5 million. Yet the share sale 
  nominally called for Morris to receive only $3 million.</p>
<p> [423] However, the trial judge found that Morris only received the equivalent 
  of $1,594,721 for his interest, far less than its fair market value of $5 million, 
  and even far less than the nominal sale price of $3 million. The trial judge 
  gave three reasons for her finding: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Some of the payments were in reality dividends to which Morris was entitled 
    to in any event;</li>
  <li>The payments were sourced in part from the reallocation of Morris's bonus 
    to Chester and a notional loan from Morris to Chester; and </li>
  <li>Other payments were made over several years and without interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [424] Finally, the lease signed as a part of the share sale required Morris, 
  through his holding company, to lease to IWS the land he owned together with 
  Chester for a term of fifty years at a rate well below market, with no inflation 
  protection or rent adjustment. Over the life of the lease the trial judge accepted 
  that this represented a rent that was $2,529,607 below market. </p>
<p>
  [425] Overall, as revealed by the trial judge's analysis of the share sale, 
  it was patently unfair, unconscionable, and manifestly disadvantageous to Morris. 
  Had Morris understood its terms, neither he nor any reasonable person in his 
  position would have agreed to it. This alone constitutes a powerful validation 
  of the trial judge's conclusion that there were no negotiations and that Morris 
  did not agree to sell his shares.</p>
<p>
  [426] Put together with the other considerations we have discussed, the trial 
  judge had good reason to accept Morris's version of events. On the other hand, 
  the trial judge had ample reason to reject Chester's story. She made no palpable 
  error in doing so.</p>
<p>
  [427] Here too, her assessments of general credibility are important, since 
  so much of the debate about whether there were any negotiations is simply Chester's 
  word against that of his brother. And as we have said, those assessments display 
  no reversible error. Beyond that, however, there was much to support her rejection 
  of Chester's story.</p>
<p>
  [428] One example is the alleged meeting at the Trocadero restaurant. Chester 
  testified that it was Morris who broached the share sale in the summer of 1982 
  when the brothers met over dinner at the restaurant. Chester made clear that 
  the tone of his response to Morris's proposal was markedly negative. Morris 
  denied that any such meeting took place. Chester's version was undermined by 
  the fact that this allegedly seminal event is not even mentioned in his very 
  detailed pleading. Moreover, his supposedly negative response is inconsistent 
  with other steps he had taken to diminish Morris's voice in the company and 
  with his desire to exclude Morris's sons from the company over the longer term. 
  </p>
<p>
  [429] A second example is Chester's testimony that he knew by the end of July 
  1983 that Morris was only interested in having Chester buy all of his shares. 
  Yet despite this knowledge, supposedly derived from the negotiations that Chester 
  said were going on, Ennis's notes reflect that as late as November 23, 1983 
  he and Chester were discussing an option to purchase the shares, not an outright 
  purchase of shares.</p>
<p>
  [430] A third example is Chester's testimony about extensive negotiations and 
  discussions between himself and Morris over a number of months. However, there 
  are no notes reflecting any such negotiations or discussions with Morris, or 
  demonstrating that any of the many draft documents prepared by Ennis made their 
  way to Morris. As the trial judge said, there are only notes of discussions 
  among Chester, Ennis, and Linton. </p>
<p>
  [431] A fourth example concerns Ennis's evidence. He attempted to support many 
  aspects of Chester's story that there were ongoing negotiations, but his evidence 
  was seriously undermined by his own documentation. Ennis said that he was first 
  consulted about the share sale in May 1983 when Morris approached him about 
  it at the synagogue, a conversation Morris denied. Ennis's own notes reveal 
  that well before that, as early as September 22, 1982, he was meeting with Chester 
  in Morris's absence to discuss share purchase alternatives. Similarly, Ennis's 
  evidence that he met with Chester on February 7, 1983 about another subject 
  was contradicted by his own notes, which recorded a general discussion about 
  the sale of shares. Ennis's records showed many meetings with Chester through 
  the fall of 1983 and many drafts of the sale documents. In cross-examination, 
  Ennis admitted that he never discussed share sale drafts or specific terms of 
  the deal with Morris before December 20, 1983. In the end, the trial judge had 
  an ample basis to find that Ennis's evidence provided no support for Chester's 
  story of negotiations with Morris, and instead supported her conclusion that 
  Chester conceived the sale entirely without Morris's knowledge and had Ennis 
  prepare documents for Morris to sign, without his having seen them before.</p>
<p>
  [432] A final example concerns Chester's testimony, again supported by Ennis, 
  that the share sale documents were signed at two meetings at Ennis's office 
  on December 20 and December 22, 1983. This testimony proved to be fraught with 
  difficulties. Chester said that at these meetings, the documents were reviewed 
  in detail, read aloud, and had changes made to them. This evidence was a vital 
  part of Chester's story that Morris knew all about the share sale and agreed 
  to it. </p>
<p>
  [433] Morris, on the other hand, said there was only one meeting, on December 
  22, 1983, and that without explanation he was asked to sign documents in his 
  various capacities as owner, officer, and director. He did as he was asked as 
  he had done many times before. He trusted his brother and his lawyer and signed 
  without reading the documents.</p>
<p>
  [434] The trial judge rejected Chester's evidence that there were two meetings 
  and found that the meeting of December 22nd took place as Morris described. 
  </p>
<p>
  [435] There was good reason for her doing so. Chester's original pleading, which 
  he reviewed and approved before it was issued, referred to only one meeting, 
  namely, December 22nd. Chester and Ennis gave accounts of the alleged December 
  20th meeting with Morris that were inconsistent in a number of respects. If 
  the chronology had unfolded as Chester described, several of the documents would 
  not have read as they did. These include a letter prepared by Ennis and used 
  by Chester on December 21st in a meeting to explain what was happening to Lasco. 
  The letter referred to the share sale as having an initial closing date of December 
  31, 1983, whereas Chester's and Ennis's evidence was that at the December 20th 
  meeting, a decision was made to amend the agreement to provide for a January 
  1984 closing date. </p>
<p>
  [436] Thus in the end, the trial judge rejected Chester's story about the negotiating 
  and signing of the share sale and accepted Morris's story. Her fundamental finding 
  at paras. 725-6 is as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> On one occasion only, on December 22, 1983, Morris was called 
  into Ennis' office to sign Share Sale documents. I accept Morris' evidence that 
  the meeting was brief. None of the documents were read aloud, reviewed, discussed 
  or explained.</p>
<p class="indent">Morris did not understand at the time that the documents he 
  was being asked to sign were out of the ordinary. He thought he was signing 
  IWS documents as its President in the usual course. He signed the documents 
  because Chester asked him to do so and because he trusted Chester and Ennis. 
  He did not want or intend to sell his shares. He had no idea that he was selling 
  his shares or signing a lease. </p>
<p>[437] In our view, this finding does not constitute palpable and overriding 
  error. </p>
<p>
  [438] The appellants also launch a number of very specific attacks on the trial 
  judge's fundamental finding.</p>
<p>
  [439] The appellants' most vigorous assault on her core finding is founded on 
  the fact that Morris signed and initialed the share sale documents, some of 
  which were highly distinctive, in more than fifty places. The appellants claim 
  that no one doing this could have been mistaken about what these documents so 
  clearly indicated. The appellants argue that Morris must have known that what 
  he was signing were documents effecting the sale of his shares.</p>
<p>
  [440] We do not agree. The context in which Morris signed all these documents 
  must be kept squarely in mind. The trial judge determined that over the months 
  before the signing, Morris had not been involved in any negotiations with Chester 
  to sell his shares and had no idea of the meetings between Chester and Ennis 
  to set up this sale. Morris came to Ennis's office on December 22nd, completely 
  trusting Chester, who was his brother and Ennis who was his lawyer. He simply 
  followed his usual pattern in such a business circumstance, signing where he 
  was asked to sign by two people he trusted implicitly. He was only a few days 
  away from an angiogram, which was to be followed by open-heart surgery shortly 
  after. He was understandably preoccupied with his own health. Moreover, given 
  the unfairness of the deal, the trial judge was not palpably wrong in finding 
  that Morris did not know what he was signing.</p>
<p>
  [441] The appellants also mount an attack on the trial judge's core finding 
  based on parts of Morris's own evidence. The appellants contend that taken individually, 
  and certainly taken collectively, these references compel the conclusion that 
  Morris knew he was selling his shares. The appellants cite a number of examples 
  of both what Morris said at the time and what he acknowledged had been said 
  to him.</p>
<p>
  [442] Morris testified that on December 14, 1983, when meeting with Ennis about 
  his will, he responded to a suggestion by Ennis that he sell his shares in the 
  company to Chester by saying "I don't want to, but if I ever did, Chester 
  wouldn't screw me and all the properties would have to remain 50/50." Morris 
  also testified that on December 22nd Chester said "this is the sale" 
  but that since he was out of sorts that day because of his health problems, 
  he did not know what Chester meant. Morris agreed that after he signed one of 
  the documents that day, Chester said to Ennis, "oh, this is to save your 
  ass". Morris also said that as he was driving back to the office he stopped 
  his car and vomited. When asked why, he said, "probably because I wasn't 
  feeling good. I could have been anxious, I could have been nervous about what 
  was happening to me. The possibility of subconsciously maybe knowing what happened 
  to me, I don't know. I don't know. I can't answer it. I just don't know. And 
  I don't remember today." That night he said that Ennis called him and seemed 
  drunk or crying. Ennis said not to blame Chester, that it was Robert's fault. 
  Morris did not know what he was talking about. Finally, on December 26, 1983 
  when Morris met with Ennis's associate, Hope, together with Wiseman to prepare 
  his will prior to entering the hospital, Hope told him that he did not own the 
  Centennial Parkway property. Morris acknowledged that he was very taken aback 
  and felt that he was "finished" and "a goner". However, 
  while he was upset at this news, he was so confused and concerned about his 
  looming angiogram that he did not understand what Hope told him. The appellants 
  claim that if Morris still thought he owned his shares he would not have reacted 
  so violently because as co-owner of IWS he would still have "owned" 
  the Centennial Parkway property. </p>
<p>
  [443] The trial judge was undoubtedly alive to all of this evidence. Indeed 
  she referred to virtually all of it in her reasons for judgment. None of Morris's 
  own statements is incompatible with the conclusion that Morris did not participate 
  in any negotiations and did not understand that he was selling his shares, and 
  simply did not comprehend the implication of the statements made to him. Moreover, 
  contrary to the appellants' submission, this evidence does not compel the contrary 
  conclusion to that reached by the trial judge, namely that Morris had negotiated 
  the deal and fully understood what he was signing. Even if taken in isolation, 
  this evidence does not provide significant support for such an inference. </p>
<p>
  [444] Although it would probably have been open to the trial judge to infer 
  from this evidence that while Morris had not negotiated a deal with his brother, 
  he did vaguely understand at some level what was happening on December 22nd, 
  it was certainly not necessary that she do so. And, as we have said, the way 
  the case was presented to her made this a less likely conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [445] In summary we cannot find that these statements by Morris render her findings 
  about the share sale palpably wrong.</p>
<p>
  [446] The appellants also rely on Wiseman's evidence regarding events on December 
  26 and December 28, 1983 to attack the core finding about the share sale. As 
  we have said at paras. 369-380 of our reasons, it was entirely open to the trial 
  judge to reject this evidence and conclude that Morris did not discuss the share 
  sale with Wiseman in this time period and that he first learned of the sale 
  on January 5, 1984.</p>
<p>
  [447] The appellants also submit that Morris's conduct after January 1984 demonstrated 
  that he knew about and affirmed the share sale. The appellants refer particularly 
  to Morris's acceptance of share sale payments, his investment and reinvestment 
  of some of these payments, his signing of annual tax returns, which included 
  capital gains from the sale of his shares, and his "notes from grave" 
  made in late January 1984.</p>
<p>
  [448] The appellants argue that in reaching her core finding on the share sale 
  in the face of these successive acts of ratification, the trial judge committed 
  reversible error. They urge this court to conclude that these events demonstrate 
  Morris's complete knowledge, awareness, and acceptance of the transaction of 
  December 1983.</p>
<p>
  [449] The trial judge considered all the post-sale evidence with care, including 
  this evidence, and rejected the conclusion advanced by the appellants. She found 
  that Morris did not accept the share sale but rather complained about it from 
  the time he first learned of it. This finding was well founded in the evidence. 
  Morris testified to this effect. Taylor, Wiseman, and Ennis each knew of Morris's 
  dissatisfaction with the sale from very early on. The trial judge accepted that 
  Morris's treatment of his tax returns simply reflected his view that it was 
  business as usual and his hope that Chester would respond to his complaint by 
  putting it right and in the meantime he did nothing to make the dispute public, 
  which was consistent with the strong family tradition of settling things internally. 
  As for the "notes from the grave", she accepted Morris's explanation 
  and read them as indicative of a very troubled man trying to grapple with a 
  growing recognition that his brother, whom he had loved and trusted implicitly 
  since childhood, had betrayed him. She did not interpret them as an admission 
  that Morris had known of the share sale all along and agreed to it. We see no 
  error in her interpretation. </p>
<p>
  [450] In addition to complaining about the trial judge's failure to draw the 
  inference from Morris's post-sale conduct that he had agreed to the deal, the 
  appellants argue that several of her particular findings are palpably wrong. 
  The appellants point first to her finding that Morris did not receive a cheque 
  from Chester for $1 million on January 4, 1984. However, the trial judge gave 
  clear reasons for this finding, weighed the evidence before her, and considered 
  what banking documents would have been available had there been such a cheque. 
  It is not the role of this court to second-guess such a finding.</p>
<p>
  [451] Second, the appellants claim that in rejecting Wiseman's evidence about 
  a meeting he had with Morris in April 1985, the trial judge misinterpreted an 
  exhibit, which Wiseman said he reviewed with Morris at that meeting. The respondents 
  concede this point, but claims that in a trial of this length and complexity 
  absolute perfection in interpreting every piece of evidence cannot be expected 
  and that this mistake is innocuous. We agree. The trial judge has a sound basis 
  to accept Morris's version of his conversation with Wiseman apart from this 
  exhibit, particularly given her findings of general credibility. Although the 
  trial judge's interpretation of the exhibit is an error, it is not a palpable 
  and overriding one.</p>
<p>
  [452] To summarize, we conclude that the trial judge committed no palpable and 
  overriding error in her fact-finding about the share sale. She was entitled 
  to apply the law to the factual basis that Morris had not negotiated the sale 
  and did not understand or agree to it.</p>
<p>
  (e) The Greycliffe Profit Diversions</p>
<p> <a name="453"></a>[453] The appellants make two major complaints about the 
  trial judge's fact-finding in connection with the profits diverted from IWS 
  to Greycliffe and four other companies through which Robert provided trucking 
  services to IWS. These services began in the late 1970s and continued until 
  Chester ended them in February 1984, shortly after the share sale.</p>
<p>
  [454] First, the appellants argue that the trial judge was palpably wrong to 
  find that while Morris knew Greycliffe was doing some trucking for IWS, he did 
  not know the rates being paid by IWS and had never agreed to them. The appellants 
  claim that this conclusion flies in the face of significant contrary evidence. 
  Chester and Robert testified that they discussed the entire arrangement with 
  Morris and that he consented to it. Linton gave evidence that Morris signed 
  cheques payable to Greycliffe. Morris was clearly interested in the trucking 
  being done by IWS and, on a daily basis, was in the yard, which the Greycliffe 
  trucks were constantly using. Indeed, Morris acknowledged that he was aware 
  that Greycliffe was providing some trucking services to IWS.</p>
<p>
  [455] In our view, the trial judge's conclusion does not represent palpable 
  and overriding error. She accepted Morris's evidence that he never discussed 
  these trucking services with Chester or Robert and was completely unaware of 
  the rates being charged to IWS. He said that he simply assumed that while Chester's 
  sons were providing some trucking services, he had no idea to what extent, and 
  he also assumed that when his own sons came into the business they would be 
  able to take equivalent amounts out of the company. Morris said that he had 
  no idea of the size of the actual profit diversions until after the lawsuit 
  started and that he viewed them as "sinful." It was entirely open 
  to the trial judge to prefer Morris's evidence over that of Chester and Robert. 
  This preference is consistent with and reflects her general credibility assessments, 
  which we have found to be unassailable on appellate review. Moreover, the appellants 
  produced no documentation to support his version of events, for example, IWS 
  cheques to Greycliffe that had been signed by Morris.</p>
<p>
  [456] Finally, the extent of the profit diversions provides solid support for 
  Morris's evidence. The trial judge found that Greycliffe's profit ratios for 
  these years were in the range of approaching fifty per cent of gross revenues, 
  some twelve times the broad industry average. Given Morris's concern that Chester's 
  side of the family not be preferred to his own, Morris would never have accepted 
  such exorbitant profits going to companies owned by Robert. He certainly would 
  never have agreed to this arrangement.</p>
<p>
  [457] Second, the appellants take issue with the trial judge's use of expert 
  evidence to assist her in determining how much Greycliffe overcharged, saying 
  that this was a matter of fact, not opinion. The appellants also argue that 
  the trial judge ought not to have accepted the particular expert evidence called 
  by the respondents.</p>
<p>
  [458] In our view, neither of these points has merit. The determination of what 
  are reasonable rates charged by various sectors of the trucking industry and 
  what reasonable profits result not information within the knowledge or experience 
  of a trier of fact and is properly the subject of expert evidence. See R. v. 
  Mohan (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (S.C.C.) at 413. Further, the appellants do 
  not offer any cogent reason to undermine the trial judge's decision to prefer 
  the respondents' experts over those of the appellants. Their opinions were reasonable 
  and well-founded. Although one of those experts had not served a pre-trial report, 
  he was called with leave in response to the appellants' unsuccessful challenge 
  of bias in relation to the respondents' first expert.</p>
<p>
  [459] In all, we see no palpable error in the trial judge's fact-finding in 
  connection with the profit diversions.</p>
<p>
  (f) The Ancaster Property</p>
<p> <a name="460"></a>[460] The last episode dealt with by the trial judge in 
  the main action concerned the Ancaster property. Morris acquired it in 1956 
  and on January 1, 1986 he conveyed it to Warren for $1. The trial judge found 
  that he did so in return for Chester promising him that Chester would "straighten 
  out", meaning he would undo the share sale. Chester denied any such conversation.</p>
<p>
  [461] The trial judge accepted Morris's version, concluded that there was a 
  contract on these terms, and found that Chester had breached it, since he had 
  not undone the share sale. She awarded Morris damages equivalent to the market 
  value of the property on January 2, 1986 which she found to be $98,000. </p>
<p>
  [462] Once again the appellants submit that Chester's evidence should have been 
  preferred to Morris's. Once again, we disagree. It was entirely open to the 
  trial judge to accept Morris's evidence over Chester's. She found him to be 
  a significantly more credible witness.</p>
<p>
  (g) The Valuation Findings</p>
<p> <a name="463"></a>[463] The final focus of the appellants' attack on the trial 
  judge's fact-finding in the main action concerned certain of her conclusions 
  about valuation.</p>
<p>
  [464] First, the appellants challenge her determination of the value of the 
  Centennial Parkway property owned by IWS, which was an important component of 
  the value of its shares as of December 1983. The appellants contend that the 
  trial judge was palpably wrong to base her conclusion on the evidence of Steven 
  Pocrnic, an expert witness called by the respondents, because his methodology 
  was flawed.</p>
<p>
  [465] We do not agree. The trial judge carefully reviewed and understood the 
  two different valuation methods used by Pocrnic in reaching his conclusion. 
  His report was prepared in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional 
  Appraisal Practice. His ultimate valuation was consistent with the price paid 
  by IWS for the property in 1980 multiplied by the average increase in sale prices 
  in the Hamilton region between 1980 and 1983. There was no palpable error in 
  the trial judge's acceptance of Pocrnic's expert opinion of the value of the 
  Centennial Parkway property.</p>
<p>
  [466] Second, the appellants challenge the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence 
  of the respondents' expert witness Frank Vettese about the value of IWS itself 
  as of December 1983. The appellants contend that it was palpably wrong for the 
  trial judge to accept this valuation since it was based on the inclusion of 
  the profits of Greycliffe in calculating the maintainable earnings of IWS.</p>
<p>
  [467] In our view, the trial judge did not err in this respect. There was no 
  need for IWS to use a separate trucking company. It could have gone forward 
  doing its own trucking. Indeed, Chester terminated the Greycliffe services soon 
  after the share sale. It was therefore entirely appropriate to value IWS by 
  including the Greycliffe enterprise. </p>
<p>
  [468] Third, the appellants argue that the trial judge erred in admitting and 
  relying on the opinion evidence of the witness Stephen Cole, who was called 
  by the respondents to assist in establishing the value of the IWS shares. The 
  appellants baldly assert that his evidence was argument, not opinion and, in 
  any event, he had not prepared a formal valuation report.</p>
<p>
  [469] We find nothing in this argument. No objection was taken to Cole's qualifications 
  to express the opinion that he did. Although he did not prepare a formal valuation 
  report, his evidence and his report provided an analysis of the financial aspects 
  of the transaction reflected in the share sale documents and the fairness of 
  it from a financial point of view. He was qualified to give this opinion and 
  the trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on it.</p>
<p>
  [470] Finally, the appellants argue that the trial judge committed palpable 
  and overriding errors in quantifying the unfairness of the lease that Morris 
  signed as part of the share sale. The errors alleged are that the trial judge 
  did not compare the rent under the lease to the rental amounts which Morris 
  had accepted for the land before the sale and that the expert opinion of Les 
  Robertson about fair market rent for the land, which the trial judge accepted, 
  was based on a flawed methodology.</p>
<p>
  [471] We do not agree. The trial judge was entitled to calculate the fairness 
  of the lease by comparing the rents it provided to fair market rents rather 
  than to what Morris had previously received. The lease was to have effect in 
  the context of Morris selling his interest in the company. As for the expert 
  witness Robertson, he explained that his methodology added value for the unused 
  lands surrounding the building covered by the lease. He did so because of the 
  extent of these surplus lands and because scrap yard properties derive considerable 
  economic value from open land area. The trial judge did not err in accepting 
  Robertson's opinion of the fair market rent based on this methodology.</p>
<p>
  ii. Contested Rulings in the Main Action</p>
<p> <a name="472"></a>[472] In addition to the appellants' attacks on the findings 
  of fact made by the trial judge, they also challenge two rulings and all of 
  the various legal bases on which the trial judge found liability in the main 
  action. We will deal with each of these in turn. </p>
<p>
  (a) The Pleadings Amendment Ruling</p>
<p><a name="473"></a>[473] At the end of January 1999, almost two months into 
  the trial, counsel for Morris sought leave of the court to amend three paragraphs 
  of the statement of claim in the main action. In essence, the proposed amendment 
  withdrew the assertion that at the December 22, 1983 meeting, Chester and Ennis 
  presented the share sale agreement to him with no forewarning and represented 
  that it was at fair market value, but that the Centennial Parkway property was 
  excluded. The proposed amendment substituted the assertion that at the December 
  meeting Morris was presented with papers to sign which he neither read nor understood. 
  It said nothing about any representations by Chester or Ennis.</p>
<p>
  [474] In support of the motion, counsel filed an affidavit of Michael who said 
  that he acted on his father's behalf in dealing with the lawyers in the preparation 
  of the statement of claim and that he thought that the original paragraphs were 
  an appropriate method of pleading representation by omission.</p>
<p>
  [475] Counsel for Chester brought a cross-motion seeking, among other things, 
  to cross-examine Michael on his communications with his lawyers.</p>
<p>
  [476] The trial judge dismissed the cross-motion and allowed the amendments. 
  In our view, she was correct to do so.</p>
<p>
  [477] The trial judge first dealt with a motion to amend under Rule 26, which 
  requires that at any stage of an action leave to amend be granted absent noncompensible 
  prejudice. Since Morris had clearly and consistently taken the position reflected 
  in the proposed new paragraphs of the claim from the time he was first examined 
  for discovery in 1991, the trial judge could find no prejudice to the appellants. 
  This conclusion is unassailable, the more so because, although the motion to 
  amend followed Morris's cross-examination, counsel offered to produce him for 
  further cross-examination on the amendment. Once the amendment was granted, 
  this offer was not taken up.</p>
<p>
  [478] The trial judge also dealt with this motion under Rule 51.05, which requires 
  leave of the court to withdraw an admission. She correctly looked to Antipas 
  v. Coroneos (1988), 26 C.P.C. (2d) 63 (Ont. H.C.J.) for the three-part test 
  required by the rule: that the proposed amendment raise a triable issue; that 
  the party provide a reasonable explanation for the change of position; and that 
  there be no non-compensable prejudice. She found that test met here.</p>
<p>
  [479] In our view, the paragraphs Morris sought to withdraw do not constitute 
  an admission for the purpose of the rule. They are not statements of fact relevant 
  to the case that Chester was seeking to make. Indeed, he expressly denied the 
  allegations in these paragraphs in his own statement of defence. Chester did 
  not rely on the misrepresentation alleged in those paragraphs; he did not seek 
  to prove that he made representations to Morris that Morris was receiving fair 
  market value.</p>
<p>
  [480] However, even if these paragraphs are treated as admissions, the trial 
  judge was correct in finding that the test in Antipas was met. The proposed 
  amendment raised a triable issue and caused no prejudice. The finding of the 
  trial judge that the explanation for the change in position offered by Michael 
  was reasonable was one clearly open to her and one with which we would not interfere.</p>
<p>
  [481] Moreover, that explanation - that Michael believed that the original pleading 
  represented a proper way to plead what happened - would not have been affected 
  by disclosure of the communications between Michael and Morris's solicitors. 
  The relevant fact was Michael's belief, not where it came from. In any event, 
  the trial judge properly ruled these communications to be privileged. She did 
  not err in refusing to permit cross-examination on these communications.</p>
<p>
  [482] We agree with the ruling of the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  (b) The Celia Butner Ruling</p>
<p> <a name="483"></a>[483] Counsel for Chester sought to have a signed statement 
  of Ms. Celia Butner dated July 29, 1991 admitted into evidence for the truth 
  of its contents. </p>
<p>
  [484] Ms. Butner had been a long-time employee of Ennis. She was present with 
  Ennis, Morris and Chester during all or part of the meeting in December 1983 
  at which the share sale documents were signed. As a legal assistant to Ennis, 
  she had known the Waxman brothers for several decades. At the time of trial 
  she was incapable of giving evidence due to her severe cognitive deficit.</p>
<p>
  [485] The trial judge dismissed the request, finding that while necessity had 
  been demonstrated, counsel had not shown sufficient indicia of reliability to 
  warrant admitting the written statement for its truth. The appellants challenge 
  that ruling in this court.</p>
<p>
  [486] We agree with the trial judge's ruling. She properly applied the criteria 
  of necessity and reliability required by the hearsay nature of the statement. 
  </p>
<p>
  [487] Ms. Butner's medical condition undoubtedly served to meet the necessity 
  criterion. However, there was ample basis for the trial judge to conclude that 
  the written statement lacked the threshold reliability to be admitted for its 
  truth. Ms. Butner was a long-time employee of Ennis and the statement was elicited 
  by Ennis's lawyer in the context of litigation against him at a time when Ms. 
  Butner was aware of key elements of her employer's defence and had helped to 
  gather documents to support it. The statement was made some seven years after 
  the events in question. The statement was reduced to writing by Ennis's counsel 
  after counsel's interview with her. Neither her statements at the interview 
  nor those as reduced to writing were made under oath or cross-examined upon. 
  The interview was not recorded verbatim in any form. The written statement could 
  possibly have been influenced by Ennis, as indicated by his letter to his counsel 
  in which he sought to discuss a draft of the statement. And finally there were 
  three drafts of the written statement. The last of these was signed by Ms. Butner, 
  but it differed from counsel's notes of the interview giving rise to the statement. 
  It was proper for the trial judge to conclude that the statement was not sufficiently 
  reliable to be admissible.</p>
<p>
  iii The Liability Issues in the Main Action</p>
<p> <a name="488"></a>[488] The trial judge began her discussion of liability 
  in the main action by setting out the basic positions of the parties - positions 
  which were reiterated in this court. We can do no better than to reproduce her 
  summary at paras. 1202-04: </p>
<p class="indent"> Counsel for the Defendants strongly urge me to take a very 
  technical, common-law/contractual approach to the issue of liability, and without 
  saying so directly, advocate that I should ignore equitable considerations. 
  They submit that all or most of the evidence to which I have already referred 
  is irrelevant to an appropriate resolution. They ask me to treat the Share Sale 
  as if it were a commercial transaction between two equally sophisticated and 
  knowledgeable arm's length businessmen, who should have been expected to protect 
  their own interests. They submit that one who signs a contract, without taking 
  the trouble to read it, is liable and cannot plead ignorance of its terms.</p>
<p class="indent">Submitting that this rule is a complete answer to Morris' claims, 
  they say Chester should be allowed to enforce documents signed by Morris, as 
  if Chester were an innocent arm's length commercial purchaser. They would have 
  it that, having established Morris signed the Share Sale documents, he has no 
  case. Having established that Morris signed the bonus minutes, he has no claim 
  to a larger share of the bonuses. On their view of the law, Morris slipped up. 
  He should have protected himself better, obtained more information, sought more 
  advice. Morris and only Morris must bear responsibility for his own carelessness. 
  "On all of the evidence, the only person responsible for this over-lengthy trial 
  is the very person who participated actively and willingly in every event - 
  Morris Waxman."</p>
<p class="indent">The Plaintiffs submit that Morris' signing of Share Sale documents 
  in December 1983 must be considered in context. Chester is not an innocent outsider 
  seeking commercial certainty. He is not trying to enforce documents signed in 
  circumstances about which he has no personal knowledge or involvement. Chester's 
  actions, as well as Morris', must be carefully scrutinised. These events took 
  place in a close family context. For Morris and Chester, business and family 
  were inseparable. Chester knew of Morris' pride of place in IWS, his perception 
  of self-importance arising out of responsibility for defined aspects of the 
  IWS business and his exceptional trust in Chester. Chester knew Morris could 
  not conceive that Chester would ever attempt to cheat him or IWS. Chester abused 
  Morris' trust. He took advantage of Morris' vulnerability resulting from his 
  dependence in financial matters exacerbated by poor health. Relief from contractual 
  obligations is widely and frequently given on equitable grounds including breach 
  of fiduciary duty, undue influence, unconscionability and under s. 248 of the 
  Business Corporations Act [footnotes omitted].</p>
<p>
  (a) The Fiduciary Duty Issue</p>
<p> <a name="489"></a>[489] The trial judge primarily based her conclusion that 
  Chester was liable to Morris on her findings that Chester had a fiduciary duty 
  to his brother in connection with the share sale, the bonuses, and the Greycliffe 
  profit diversions and that he breached that duty.</p>
<p>
  [490] She came to the fiduciary duty finding by two routes. First, given the 
  history of their lives and the way IWS had always been run, the brothers were 
  partners in the business. The incorporation of the business in 1956 did not 
  change that reality. She found that, as partners, Morris and Chester owed each 
  other fiduciary duties. Indeed Chester conceded as much in his evidence.</p>
<p>
  [491] Second, the trial judge applied the criteria developed in the jurisprudence 
  to determine the existence of a fiduciary duty absent a traditionally recognized 
  fiduciary relationship such as a partnership. She found that whether one uses 
  the approach of the majority or that of the minority in the seminal case of 
  Hodgkinson, supra, the conclusion is the same: the brothers owed each other 
  fiduciary duties. She summarized her finding as follows at para. 1262: </p>
<p class="indent">
  I find that, in all of the circumstances here, there was a fiduciary expectation 
  that arose from the conduct and the relationship of the parties. Chester owed 
  Morris fiduciary obligations in the exercise of his power and discretion over 
  financial and legal matters, even as they affected Morris personally. They had 
  a special and close personal relationship as brothers. They had a special and 
  close business relationship as 50/50 partners, who had built IWS together. In 
  the financial and legal sphere, Morris was dependent on Chester both in relation 
  to IWS and personally. By his conduct, Chester represented to Morris that their 
  personal and business interests were common, identical and without conflict. 
  Morris relied absolutely and completely on Chester in legal and financial matters. 
  Chester was fully aware of the trust and confidence that Morris reposed in him 
  and of Morris' vulnerability.</p>
<p>
  [492] The trial judge then went on to determine the scope of the fiduciary duty 
  owed by Chester to Morris and found that in the context of their relationship, 
  it encompassed a duty of good faith, a duty to avoid conflict and, most importantly, 
  a duty of disclosure.</p>
<p>
  [493] She set out her conclusion that Chester breached this duty to Morris in 
  connection with the share sale in these words at para. 1283: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Chester breached his fiduciary duty to Morris with respect to the Share Sale, 
  the lease and other documents signed on December 22, 1983, when he failed to 
  adequately disclose to Morris the fact of the sale and the nature of the documents. 
  It was not enough to simply say "this is the sale and look over the documents." 
  Chester asked Morris to sign documents he knew Morris had not read and would 
  not read, to transfer shares he did not want to transfer. Chester knew Morris 
  was ill. He did not disclose the other information set out above. I have found 
  that Chester did indeed "trick"/"hoodwink" Morris into signing 
  documents that day. Chester stood to benefit enormously. In all of the circumstances 
  here, Chester clearly breached his fiduciary duty to Morris.</p>
<p>
  [494] Her conclusion in respect of the bonuses was equally clear at paras. 1284-5: </p>
<p class="indent"> Morris relied upon Chester and reasonably expected he would 
  act in IWS' and his own personal best interest. Given his 50% ownership, Morris 
  was entitled to assume he would receive 50% of IWS profits and equity.</p>
<p class="indent">Given the division of responsibility within the partnership, 
  Chester's willing assumption of responsibility for financial matters, his cultivation 
  of Morris' trust, and Morris' resulting total dependence and reliance on Chester 
  in financial matters, his knowledge that Morris did not read corporate documents 
  before he signed because corporate documents were Chester's responsibility, 
  Chester owed Morris a duty to properly disclose the declaration of the 1979, 
  1981 and 1982 bonuses to Morris and obtain his consent. Chester did not do so.</p>
<p>
  [495] Turning to the Greycliffe profit diversions, the trial judge found that 
  Chester allowed Robert to use Greycliffe and related companies to extract exorbitant 
  amounts from IWS that should have remained with the company, and that he kept 
  Morris in the dark about this. She concluded as follows at paras. 1292-93: </p>
<p class="indent"> Chester knew that profit diversions to related companies were 
  affecting IWS' profitability. He had the power to stop the improper profit diversions. 
  He waited until shortly after the Share Sale to do so.</p>
<p class="indent">Chester breached his fiduciary duties to Morris in respect of 
  the profit diversions to Greycliffe and the other related companies. He failed 
  in his duty of good faith, his duty of disclosure, his duty to avoid a conflict.</p>
<p>
  [496] The appellants main challenge to these conclusions is to the findings 
  of fact which underpin them. Apart from this, however, the appellants mount 
  three legal attacks on these findings, all of which assume the facts as found 
  by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [497] First, the appellants contend that fundamental to the application of the 
  fiduciary principle is the intention to contract and that the principle can 
  be properly resorted to only if Morris intended to sell his shares to Chester. 
  The appellants argue that the fiduciary principle cannot be used to find liability 
  where a person signed documents but claimed he did not know the nature and character 
  of the documents he was signing. The appellants contend that unless Morris can 
  demonstrate the applicability of the concepts in cases like Marvco Color Research 
  Ltd. v. Harris, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 774 (concepts like fraud, misrepresentation, 
  and non est factum), the principle of personal responsibility requires that 
  he be bound by his signature. That signature cannot be touched by the principle 
  of fiduciary breach. This argument addresses the conclusions of the trial judge 
  both in relation to the share sale and the bonuses.</p>
<p>
  [498] Second, the appellants argue that no fiduciary duty can arise on the facts 
  as found because they involve no more than the sale of shares by one shareholder 
  to another and because Chester gave no express undertaking to act in Morris's 
  best interest in connection with that transaction. This argument addresses the 
  share sale but not the bonuses or the profit diversions. </p>
<p>
  [499] Finally, the appellants argue that, in connection with the share sale, 
  Chester did not breach his fiduciary duty should one be found to exist. The 
  appellants contend that he did not withhold any material facts about the condition 
  of the company or its value from Morris.</p>
<p>
  [500] We will deal with each of these arguments in turn, but first it is important 
  to be clear on the role of an appellate court in reviewing findings of fiduciary 
  duty made at trial.</p>
<p>
  [501] In Hodgkinson, at 425-26, La Forest J. made clear that significant deference 
  must be granted on appeal to findings at trial on whether or not there was a 
  fiduciary duty and whether or not there was a breach of such a duty. He said 
  that absent manifest error, such as a material and identifiable error of law 
  or a clear and identifiable error of fact in appreciating the evidence, an appellate 
  court should not interfere. </p>
<p>
  [502] We turn then to the appellants' first argument, namely that the fiduciary 
  principle cannot be used to relieve Morris from the consequences of his own 
  signature.</p>
<p>
  [503] We disagree with this proposition. As La Forest J. said in Hodgkinson, 
  at 405, the fiduciary principle is an equitable doctrine designed to protect 
  vulnerable parties in transactions with others. It focuses on the relationship 
  between the participants to the transaction and the presence of factors such 
  as loyalty, trust and confidence that characterize the relationship as fiduciary. 
  In La Forest J.'s words at 406 of Hodgkinson, "the fiduciary principle 
  monitors the abuse of a loyalty reposed". </p>
<p>
  [504] There is no suggestion in the jurisprudence that this principle can apply 
  only where the fiduciary relationship and the abuse of loyalty exist in a transaction 
  where a contract has been concluded by parties who mutually intend to do so. 
  Quite the opposite. In Guerin v. Canada, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335 at 384, Dickson 
  J. said: "It is the nature of the relationship, not the specific category 
  of actor involved that gives rise to the fiduciary duty. The categories of fiduciary, 
  like those of negligence, should not be considered closed."</p>
<p>
  [505] The existence of a fiduciary duty depends on the precise circumstances 
  of the particular relationship, not on the presence of any legal precondition 
  such as the existence of a contract. Apt here is the phrase of Lord Scarman, 
  repeated by La Forest J. in Hodgkinson, at 413-14: "[t]here is no substitute 
  in this branch of the law for a meticulous examination of the facts".</p>
<p>
  [506] Moreover, a scan of the jurisprudence on fiduciary duty quickly demonstrates 
  its application in many circumstances that do not require a contractual relationship: 
  see for example the relationships of parent/child (M. (K.) v. M. (H)., [1992] 
  3 S.C.R. 6); government/foster children (K.L.B. v. British Columbia, [2003] 
  2 S.C.R. 403); custodial/non-custodial parents (Frame v. Smith, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 
  99); and doctor/patient (McInerney v. MacDonald, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 138).</p>
<p>
  [507] To do as the appellants argue would dramatically limit the utility of 
  the fiduciary principle with untenable results. Where a dishonest fiduciary 
  has persuaded his beneficiary to sign contractual documents, the fiduciary ought 
  not to be better off because he has ensured that the beneficiary has no understanding 
  of the documents whatsoever. In the context of this case, the fiduciary principle 
  does not make Chester better off for ensuring that Morris did not understand 
  what he was signing than he would have been had he explained to Morris the contents 
  of those documents. </p>
<p>
  [508] Nor can it be said that this application of the fiduciary principle undercuts 
  the principle of personal responsibility reflected in cases like Marvco, supra. 
  Unlike that case, this was not a commercial transaction done at arm's length 
  between two business people. Morris and Chester had a relationship that developed 
  over a lifetime. It was one of complete loyalty and trust in connection with 
  the business of IWS and their interests in it. The evidence of the fiduciary 
  nature of this relationship was overwhelming. </p>
<p>
  [509] In these circumstances it was entirely appropriate for the trial judge 
  to apply the fiduciary principle despite Morris's signatures, given that Chester 
  had Morris sign knowing that he had no understanding of what was really going 
  on, either with the share sale or the bonuses. While the result might have been 
  different if Chester had persuaded the trial judge that Morris's signatures 
  were indeed fully informed, Chester's evidence to this effect was simply disbelieved. 
  Thus we would not give effect to the appellants' first argument.</p>
<p>
  [510] The appellants' second argument is that the fiduciary duty does not arise 
  on the sale of shares by one shareholder to another, particularly where there 
  has been no express undertaking by the selling shareholder to act in the other's 
  interest. </p>
<p>
  [511] Again, we do not agree. There is no reason to preclude the existence of 
  a fiduciary duty when one shareholder sells his or her interest to another. 
  It all depends on the relationship between them: see, for example, Tongue v. 
  Vencap Equities Alberta Ltd. (1994), 148 A.R. 321 (Q.B.), aff'd (1996), 184 
  A.R. 368 (C.A.); Dusik v. Newton (1985), 62 B.C.L.R. 1 (C.A.). Although a fiduciary 
  relationship between parties may not always extend to a share sale between them, 
  the evidence that it does so in this case is again overwhelming. We repeat the 
  trial judge's findings that make this clear: </p>
<p class="indent">
  They had a special and close personal relationship as brothers. They had a special 
  and close business relationship as 50/50 partners, who had built IWS together. 
  In the financial and legal sphere, Morris was dependent on Chester both in relation 
  to IWS and personally. By his conduct, Chester represented to Morris that their 
  personal and business interests were common, identical and without conflict. 
  Morris relied absolutely and completely on Chester in legal and financial matters. 
  Chester was fully aware of the trust and confidence that Morris reposed in him 
  and of Morris' vulnerability (para. 1262).</p>
<p>
  [512] Nor is it necessary that there be an express undertaking concerning the 
  specific transaction. The focus must be on the relationship and the mutual understanding 
  of trust and loyalty that goes with it. As the trial judge found, the lifelong 
  relationship between the brothers led Morris to the reasonable expectation that 
  he could completely trust Chester to look after his interest in IWS. In effect, 
  Chester represented this to Morris by the course of his conduct throughout their 
  relationship. He did not need to make any express representation to Morris about 
  this transaction in order for a fiduciary duty to be found in connection with 
  it. </p>
<p>
  [513] The appellants' third argument is that Chester did not breach his fiduciary 
  duty to Morris in connection with the share sale because he did not possess 
  any information material to the value of the share sale, which Morris did not 
  also have. In our view, this argument entirely misses the mark. Not only did 
  the trial judge find as a fact on the basis of ample evidence that Morris was 
  unaware of much material information relevant to the value of IWS prior to December 
  23, 1983, she also provided a number of other examples: see paras. 1271-72 of 
  her reasons.</p>
<p>
  [514] Even more importantly, she found that Chester did not explain to Morris 
  that he was being asked to sign share sale documents turning over his interest 
  in IWS to Chester. Chester had Morris sign knowing that Morris trusted him implicitly 
  and that Morris had no idea what was really going on. How could this be anything 
  other than a breach of the fiduciary duty Chester owed to his brother?</p>
<p>
  [515] In short, we find that the appellants' legal arguments relating to fiduciary 
  duty must all fail.</p>
<p>
  (b) The Undue Influence and Unconscionability Issues</p>
<p> <a name="516"></a>[516] The trial judge used both concepts as alternative 
  bases for the remedies she ordered against Chester in connection with the share 
  sale. The appellants argue that she erred in doing so in the absence of a finding 
  that the share sale was a concluded contract to which Morris, at some level, 
  consented. We find it unnecessary to address this issue. Given our other findings, 
  the answer to the question posed by the appellants could have no effect on the 
  outcome of this appeal.</p>
<p>
  (c) The Oppression Issue</p>
<p> <a name="517"></a>[517] The trial judge found that Morris was entitled to 
  relief under s. 248 of the OBCA in connection with the share sale, the December 
  1983 lease, the 1979, 1981 and 1982 bonuses, the wrongful termination of his 
  employment, and the profit diversions to Greycliffe and related companies. In 
  each case she found that there was oppression warranting a remedy, although 
  not always against the same defendants. </p>
<p>
  [518] For the share sale, the December 1983 lease, the 1979 bonuses, and Morris's 
  wrongful termination, Chester and IWS were found liable to Morris under s. 248. 
  For the 1981 and 1982 bonuses, Chester, IWS, and Chester's three sons were found 
  liable to Morris under s. 248. And for the profit diversions, Chester, IWS, 
  Robert, and Robert's companies were found liable to Morris under s. 248.</p>
<p>
  [519] Section 248 reads in part as follows: </p>
<p class="indent"> 248. (1) A complainant&#133;may apply to the court for an order 
  under this section.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where, upon an application under subsection (1), the court 
  is satisfied that in respect of a corporation or any of its affiliates,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) any act or omission of the corporation of any of its affiliates 
  effects or threatens to effect a result;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the business or affairs of the corporation or any of its 
  affiliates are, have been or are threatened to be carried on or conducted in 
  a manner; or</p>
<p class="indent">(c) the powers of the directors of the corporation or any of 
  its affiliates are, have been or are threatened to be exercised in a manner,</p>
<p class="indent">that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to or that unfairly 
  disregards the interests of any security holder, creditor, director or officer 
  of the corporation, the court may make an order to rectify the matters complained 
  of.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) In connection with an application under this section, the 
  court may make any interim or final order it thinks fit including, without limiting 
  the generality of the foregoing...</p>
<p class="indent">(h) an order varying or setting aside a transaction or contract 
  to which a corporation is a party and compensating the corporation or any other 
  party to the transaction or contract;</p>
<p class="indent">(i) an order requiring a corporation, within a time specified 
  by the court, to produce to the court or an interested person financial statements 
  in the form required by section 154 or an accounting in such other form as the 
  court may determine;</p>
<p class="indent">(j) an order compensating an aggrieved person;</p>
<p class="indent">(k) an order directing rectification of the registers or other 
  records of a corporation under section 250...</p>
<p>
  [520] The appellants raise a number of legal arguments to challenge the trial 
  judge's findings under this section. </p>
<p>
  [521] First, the appellants argue that Morris cannot resort to the oppression 
  remedy where the acts he complains of, particularly the share sale (including 
  the December 1983 lease) and the bonuses, were effected by his own signatures 
  on various corporate documents. The appellant looks for assistance to s. 129(1) 
  of the OBCA, which provides: </p>
<p class="indent">
  129. (1) A resolution in writing, signed by all the directors entitled to vote 
  on that resolution at a meeting of directors or a committee of directors, is 
  as valid as if it had been passed at a meeting of directors or a committee of 
  directors. </p>
<p>
  [522] We cannot agree with this submission. Morris's signatures were procured 
  through Chester's breach of his fiduciary duty. We do not think that the deemed 
  validity provided by s. 129(1) extends to signatures obtained in this way, at 
  least as against the signatories who were owed that duty. If the Legislature 
  had intended to eradicate such fiduciary obligations it would have done so explicitly. 
  Moreover, nothing in s. 248 suggests that Morris's signatures on the corporate 
  documents bar him from being a complainant under s. 248(1) or deprives the court 
  of its broad discretion to conclude that the various actions were oppressive 
  towards him. </p>
<p>
  [523] Finally, s. 248(3) gives the court a broad remedial authority where it 
  finds conduct that qualifies as oppressive. It may make any order it thinks 
  fit to rectify the matters complained of. This explicitly includes setting aside 
  a transaction or contract to which the corporation is a party or amending unanimous 
  shareholder agreements, corporate articles or by-laws. This statutory language 
  is to be given a broad interpretation consistent with its remedial purpose: 
  see Ferguson v. IMAX Systems Corp. (1983), 43 O.R. (2d) 128 at 137 (C.A.), leave 
  to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1983), 2 O.A.C. 158n.</p>
<p>
  [524] On the facts as found by the trial judge, Chester conducted the business 
  and affairs of IWS - the share sale, the lease, the bonuses, and the profit 
  diversions - in a manner that was clearly oppressive of Morris's interests. 
  The appellants do not contest that in this appeal. It was open to the trial 
  judge to use her remedial jurisdiction under s. 248 to rectify the acts of oppression 
  as she did even if there were otherwise valid corporate resolutions authorizing 
  those acts.</p>
<p>
  [525] The appellants' second argument is that only IWS can make a claim under 
  s. 248 in respect of the bonuses since the monies paid out were from the corporation. 
  The appellants claim that Morris cannot use s. 248 since his is a derivative 
  claim only. </p>
<p>
  [526] The simple answer to this argument is that Morris clearly qualifies as 
  a complainant for the purposes of s. 248 as it was he who was personally aggrieved 
  by the distribution of bonus monies for 1979, 1981 and 1982. This distribution 
  was done at the expense of his interest in the company. That these claims could 
  have been the subject of a derivative action does not prevent them from also 
  constituting a proper case of oppression: see Jabalee v. Abalmark Inc., [1996] 
  O.J. No. 2609 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [527] Third, the appellants contend that using s. 248 to find liability against 
  Warren, Robert, and Gary for receipt of the 1981 and 1982 bonuses is wrong in 
  law. None of the sons was a shareholder or director of IWS.</p>
<p>
  [528] Again there is a simple answer to this assertion. On the facts as found, 
  there is no doubt that the payment of these bonuses was oppressive of Morris's 
  interests. The recipients were not innocent strangers to this. As the trial 
  judge found, the sons could not reasonably have ever thought that they deserved 
  the bonuses or that Morris had agreed to them. Providing a remedy against them 
  for accepting those monies properly rectifies the oppressive actions. The trial 
  judge did not err in exercising her broad remedial authority under the statute 
  to do so.</p>
<p>
  [529] Fourth, the appellant argues that the oppression remedy ought not to be 
  applied to capture conduct that occurred before the remedy came into force and 
  that the trial judge erred in doing so. The oppression provisions of the OBCA 
  came into force on July 29, 1983.</p>
<p>
  [530] We do not agree. There is no doubt that the trial judge ordered relief 
  under s. 248 for events that occurred, or at least commenced, before July 29, 
  1983. The 1979 bonuses preceded that date. Payments of the 1981 and 1982 bonuses 
  began before that date but continued after it. So did the Greycliffe profit 
  diversions.</p>
<p>
  [531] The trial judge based this application of s. 248 on the finding that the 
  oppression provisions, although not procedural, were intended to be retrospective 
  in application: see Re Mason and Intercity Properties Ltd. (1986), 32 A.C.W.S. 
  (2d) 366 (Ont. Div. Ct.), varied on unrelated other grounds (1987), 59 O.R. 
  (2d) 631 (C.A.).</p>
<p>
  [532] We agree that the oppression provisions of the OBCA are not merely procedural. 
  They provide significant substantive rights and remedies. However, because of 
  the facts of this case, we need not decide whether there is a sufficiently clear 
  expression of legislative intent to require that these provisions be given full 
  retrospective application to conduct that was completely concluded before their 
  enactment. Rather, we think that the essence of the trial judgment is that starting 
  at least in 1979 and continuing well beyond July 1983, the appellants conducted 
  the business of IWS in a way that was oppressive of Morris. This pattern of 
  conduct, although it commenced before July 1983, was ongoing well after that 
  date. This is equally true of the subcomponents of that pattern, such as the 
  improper payment of bonuses and the Greycliffe profit diversions. They too were 
  going on well after July 1983. This ongoing pattern of oppression is what Professor 
  Sullivan describes as a continuing fact situation: see R. Sullivan, Driedger 
  on the Construction of Statutes, 3rd ed. (Markham: Butterworths, 1994) at 514-15.</p>
<p>
  [533] In providing remedies under s. 248 for conduct that took place in part 
  before July 1983, but that continued after this date, the trial judge was simply 
  doing what the legislation expressly contemplates, namely making orders to rectify 
  the pattern of oppressive conduct complained of. We do not need to decide if 
  the legislation may be applied to a pattern of conduct that was fully concluded 
  before the provisions became effective. </p>
<p>
  [534] Fifth, the appellants contend that the trial judge erred in applying the 
  oppression remedy to events that occurred five or more years before the claim 
  was made. </p>
<p>
  [535] Again, we disagree. The appellants seek assistance from Jaska v. Jaska 
  (1996), 141 D.L.R. (4th) 385 (Man. C.A.). In that case the court determined 
  that the counterpart Manitoba legislation could not reach back in time to the 
  extent sought by the respondents. In Jaska, however, the result depended on 
  a general limitation period imposed by the Manitoba Limitations of Actions Act, 
  R.S.M. 1987, c. L150, which has no counterpart in Ontario, and in part on an 
  exercise of the court's discretion in the circumstances of that case. </p>
<p>
  [536] The trial judge understandably found the Jaska case of little assistance 
  to her, because in this case there is no similar legislative provision and the 
  oppression of Morris continued right up until the commencement of the action. 
  The trial judge exercised her discretion to apply her broad remedial authority 
  to the pattern of oppressive conduct that started in 1979. In doing so she neither 
  abused her discretion nor ran afoul of any legislative limitation period.</p>
<p>
  [537] Sixth, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in applying s. 
  248 to order a remedy against IWS in connection with the share sale, since IWS 
  was not a party to the sale. In our view, the trial judge was correct to do 
  so. A dispute over a transaction that determined shareholder control of a corporation 
  is one "in respect of" that corporation as that phrase is used in 
  the opening paragraph of s. 248(2). As such, it clearly engages the court's 
  jurisdiction under this section: see GATX Corp. v. Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc. 
  (1996), 27 B.L.R. (2d) 251 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), per Blair J. </p>
<p>
  [538] Having found such a transaction here and having concluded that it was 
  oppressive to Morris, the trial judge found that part of the appropriate rectification 
  of that oppression was a remedial order against IWS itself because of its deep 
  involvement in the process. This order represents no error in the exercise of 
  her broad remedial authority, given the very significant participation of IWS 
  in the oppression, as the trial judge spelled out graphically at para. 1387 
  of her reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  The way in which the Share Sale was implemented deeply implicated IWS. Chester, 
  acting as if he were already the 100% owner of IWS, put the resources of IWS 
  at his own disposal to make his share purchase so that he would have 100% ownership 
  of IWS. By causing the corporation to act, he engaged s. 248(2)(a). He arranged 
  for IWS to declare a million-dollar dividend that he would use to pay for part 
  of Morris' shares; for IWS to reallocate $412,000 of Morris' 1982 bonus to himself 
  to pay for Morris' shares; for IWS to borrow $500,000 from Morris, interest-free; 
  for Linton, the IWS comptroller, to issue an IWS cheque in the amount of $500,000 
  payable to Morris, even though the Share Sale Agreement provided that payments 
  were to be made by Chester personally. By his actions and IWS' actions, Chester 
  secured control of IWS. Chester made IWS a party to the December 1983 lease.</p>
<p>
  [539] In short, the appellants' oppression arguments all must fail.</p>
<p>
  (d) The Knowing Receipt/Knowing Assistance issue</p>
<p> <a name="540"></a>[540] The trial judge employed the doctrines of knowing 
  receipt and knowing assistance in dealing with two aspects of the main action, 
  namely Morris's claim in connection with the 1981 and 1982 bonuses, and his 
  claim in relation to the profit diversions from IWS to Robert's companies, primarily 
  Greycliffe.</p>
<p>
  [541] She found Robert, Gary and, Warren liable to Morris for knowing receipt 
  of their 1981 and 1982 bonuses. She found that they had at least constructive 
  knowledge that these bonuses were paid to them in breach of Chester's fiduciary 
  duty to Morris. She ordered that they pay to Morris amounts equivalent to the 
  full payments they received. This relief duplicates the relief granted under 
  s. 248 of the OBCA to Morris against his three nephews in connection with those 
  bonuses. </p>
<p>
  [542] As to the profit diversions, the trial judge found Chester liable to Morris 
  for knowingly assisting Robert to dishonestly divert the profits to Robert's 
  companies in breach of his fiduciary duty to IWS (and therefore presumably to 
  Morris as well). In the same way, she found Robert's companies liable to Morris 
  for knowingly receiving these profits. </p>
<p>
  [543] The trial judge ordered Chester to pay Morris an amount equal to fifty 
  per cent of the profits diverted and ordered Robert's companies to pay to Morris 
  fifty per cent of the profits they each received. The relief ordered on this 
  basis against Chester duplicated the relief based on s. 248 of the OBCA and 
  the relief based on Chester's breach of fiduciary duty to Morris. The relief 
  against Robert's companies duplicates that ordered against them pursuant to 
  s. 248. </p>
<p>
  [544] The appellants argue that the trial judge made two errors of law in applying 
  the doctrines of knowing receipt and knowing assistance.</p>
<p>
  [545] First, the appellants argue that these doctrines cannot apply where there 
  is only a breach of fiduciary duty. Rather, they can only apply where the monies 
  wrongly paid out are trust monies and here, the 1981 and the 1982 bonuses are 
  simply corporate funds paid out pursuant to signed corporate resolutions.</p>
<p>
  [546] We do not agree that these two doctrines have such a narrow compass. We 
  agree with the trial judge that both are available in the context of a breach 
  of fiduciary duty and not simply where trust monies are involved. Thus she did 
  not err in applying these doctrines without concluding that either the 1981 
  and 1982 bonuses or the profit diversions constituted trust monies. </p>
<p>
  [547] Laskin J.A. made clear that a breach of fiduciary duty may trigger the 
  imposition of liability on third parties in Gold v. Rosenberg (1995), 129 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 152, aff'd on other grounds [1997] 3 S.C.R. 767. Speaking for this court, 
  he said at 154: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Beginning with the judgment of Lord Selborne in Barnes v. Addy (1874), L.R. 
  9 Ch. App. 244, courts have imposed the obligations of a trustee on third parties 
  who participate in another's breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty. Third 
  parties may be liable as "constructive trustees" if they knowingly 
  receive trust property obtained in breach of trust (the "knowing receipt" 
  cases) or if, without receiving trust property, they knowingly assist in its 
  misapplication (the "knowing assistance" cases).</p>
<p>[548] Paul Perell, in his article "Intermeddlers or Strangers to the Breach 
  of Trust or Fiduciary Duty", (1999) 21 Advocates' Q. 94, makes the same 
  point, namely that these equitable doctrines apply to both breaches of trust 
  and breaches of fiduciary duty. An example of the latter application is found 
  in MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Binstead (1983), 22 B.L.R. 255 (B.C.S.C.), cited 
  with approval in Soulos v. Korkontzilas, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 217 at 239. </p>
<p>
  [549] Moreover, in this context there is no reason in principle to differentiate 
  between the beneficiary of a trust obligation and the beneficiary of a fiduciary 
  obligation. Both are equally deserving of the protection of equity as against 
  a third party who knowingly assists in the dishonest breach of that obligation 
  or knowingly receives funds paid in breach of it.</p>
<p>
  [550] The appellants' second argument is that Robert, Warren, and Gary can be 
  found liable in knowing receipt for no more than one-half of the bonuses they 
  received for 1981 and 1982. </p>
<p>
  [551] We agree with this submission. The trial judge based her conclusion on 
  the finding that Chester's sons knew that the source of the money used to pay 
  those bonuses was the proceeds of the sale of the two divisions of IWS of which 
  Morris owned fifty per cent. She further found that reasonable young men in 
  their position would have known that the bonuses were a distribution of IWS 
  equity and not the payment of reasonable compensation. </p>
<p>
  [552] Although she did not say so expressly, the trial judge clearly concluded 
  from these findings that Chester's sons had constructive knowledge that half 
  their bonus monies represented Morris's equity in IWS and were paid to them 
  in breach of Chester's fiduciary duty to Morris. The trial judge did not conclude 
  that Chester's sons had constructive knowledge that Morris had a beneficial 
  interest in one hundred per cent of the bonus monies they received for these 
  two years. Nor could she have done so on these facts. As a distribution of equity, 
  Morris had a beneficial interest in only half of it.</p>
<p>
  [553] The elements of the doctrine of knowing receipt are set out in the Perell 
  article, supra, at 110: a trust or fiduciary relationship; the third party receiving 
  property from the trust or fiduciary relationship in his or her own personal 
  capacity; and the third party having actual or constructive knowledge that the 
  property was transferred in breach of trust or fiduciary duty. Thus liability 
  for knowing receipt does not extend beyond the property which the third party 
  knows (or is deemed to know) has been received in breach of trust or fiduciary 
  duty.</p>
<p>
  [554] In this case Chester's sons knew that their bonus monies for 1981 and 
  1982 represented a distribution of IWS equity, half of which was Morris's. Their 
  knowledge (either actual or constructive) that Chester was in breach of his 
  fiduciary duty to Morris by paying these bonuses could therefore extend only 
  to the fifty per cent in which Morris had a beneficial interest; they could 
  be liable in knowing receipt for no more than this amount.</p>
<p>
  [555] Although the appellants do not expressly argue the point, the same logic 
  applies to the remedy under s. 248 of the OBCA against Chester's sons in respect 
  of the 1981 and 1982 bonuses. The payment of those bonuses constitutes an act 
  of oppression against Morris in so far as the payment was made with Morris's 
  fifty per cent share of the proceeds from the sale of the two divisions of IWS. 
  And under s. 248(2), the order to rectify that matter must be limited to the 
  fifty per cent of the bonuses received by Chester's sons for 1981 and 1982. 
  </p>
<p>
  [556] In the body of her reasons, the trial judge found that an order may be 
  made against Chester's sons in respect of the receipt of the 1981 and 1982 bonuses 
  both under s. 248 of the OBCA and in knowing receipt. In her summary of liability 
  findings, the trial judge found Chester's sons liable to Morris for these bonuses 
  only in knowing receipt. The formal judgment orders that they pay Morris the 
  sum equivalent to the full amount of the bonuses. Whether that order is based 
  on only the doctrine of knowing receipt or also on s. 248 of the OBCA, we amend 
  it to provide for liability in an amount equal to fifty per cent of the bonuses 
  received by Chester's sons for 1981 and 1982.</p>
<p>
  (e) Remedy for the Greycliffe Profit Diversions Issue</p>
<p> <a name="557"></a>[557] As we have described, the trial judge found liability 
  on a number of different bases against Chester, IWS, Robert, Robert's companies, 
  and Gary in relation to the profits diverted from IWS to Greycliffe and the 
  related companies owned by Robert. </p>
<p>
  [558] Chester was found liable for breaching his fiduciary duty to Morris by 
  knowingly allowing the improper profit diversions. He was also found liable 
  to Morris under s. 248 of the OBCA and for knowingly assisting Robert in breaching 
  his fiduciary duty to IWS (and therefore presumably to Morris as a fifty per 
  cent owner) by charging IWS rates that far exceeded competitive rates.</p>
<p>
  [559] IWS was found liable to Morris under s. 248 of the OBCA as were Robert 
  and Robert's companies. Robert's companies were also found liable to Morris 
  in knowing receipt.</p>
<p>
  [560] The trial judge then went on to find that because all the services provided 
  by Greycliffe and related companies could have been done by IWS itself, all 
  the diverted profits could have been retained within IWS. She therefore ordered 
  Chester and IWS to pay to Morris an amount equivalent to fifty per cent of all 
  profits received from IWS by Greycliffe and related companies after allowing 
  for a modest additional management fee of $50,000 that IWS would have had to 
  incur to perform these services itself. The various companies were all ordered 
  to pay Morris fifty per cent of their individual profits from IWS. </p>
<p>
  [561] Against this backdrop, the appellants make two legal arguments. First, 
  the claim for profit diversions is a claim for the diversion of IWS corporate 
  revenue and can only be made by IWS or by way of a derivative claim, neither 
  of which was made here. The simple answer to this is that the trial judge found 
  liability against these various parties on a number of legal bases that are 
  quite independent of whether IWS could also have made a claim itself. The fact 
  that IWS might have done so does not in any way undermine the validity of claims 
  based on fiduciary breach, knowing receipt, knowing assistance, or s. 248 of 
  the OBCA.</p>
<p>
  [562] Second, the appellants argue that in ordering payment equivalent to fifty 
  per cent of all the profits made by Greycliffe and Robert's other companies, 
  the trial judge went too far. We agree with this. Morris was undoubtedly aware 
  that Robert was providing some trucking and related services to IWS through 
  companies like Greycliffe. His concern was that after the fact, he discovered 
  that the level of profits received by those companies was so excessive as to 
  be (in his own words) "a sin" rather than the reasonable rate of profit 
  he would have anticipated. He was also candid in admitting that "reasonable" 
  was to be assessed generously, since the profits were being earned by a member 
  of the family, and that he would expect the same treatment to be accorded to 
  his sons if and when they joined the business. </p>
<p>
  [563] This reality was recognized by the trial judge when she identified just 
  what it was that constituted Chester's breach of fiduciary duty to Morris, the 
  oppression under s. 248 and Robert's breach of fiduciary duty: it was that Robert 
  arranged for his companies to receive excessive profits for their services to 
  IWS and that Chester knowingly permitted this to happen. The gravamen of the 
  conduct was not that Robert's companies made any profit at all on these services, 
  but that these profits were more, indeed much more, than was reasonable.</p>
<p>
  [564] Having found that excessive profits were what attracted liability, the 
  trial judge's remedial order in Morris's favour could not properly extend beyond 
  his share of that portion of the profits received by Robert's companies that 
  was excessive. In basing her order on all profits received by these companies, 
  the trial judge reached beyond the fiduciary breaches and the oppression that 
  she had found. Her remedy also compensated for the payment of reasonable profits, 
  which were the product of neither. She erred in so doing.</p>
<p>
  [565] If the correct remedial order for the profit diversions should reflect 
  only those profits that were excessive or unreasonable, the question is whether 
  this court can make that order. While all parties made it clear that a new trial 
  was to be avoided at all costs, the state of the record before us makes the 
  challenge of fixing a proper remedial order a less precise exercise than is 
  desirable. Nonetheless, in the interest of finality we must attempt it.</p>
<p>
  [566] The evidence accepted by the trial judge showed that Greycliffe, the main 
  provider of trucking services to IWS, was operating at a profit ratio of approximately 
  fifty per cent or thereabouts, while the industry average hovered around five 
  per cent. For this purpose we will take Greycliffe to be typical of Robert's 
  other companies. Using this as a rough and ready tool of analysis we conclude 
  that a profit ratio of half that or twenty-five per cent would constitute a 
  reasonable level of profit for these companies in the circumstances. While still 
  significantly above the industry norm, this profit ratio reflects that the profits 
  were going to a family member and that the context here was the Waxman family. 
  </p>
<p>
  [567] On this basis, in operating at a fifty per cent profit ratio, half of 
  all the profits received by Robert's companies were beyond the reasonable level 
  of twenty-five per cent, and thus excessive. The order should therefore provide 
  Morris with his half of that half. We amend the part of the order relating to 
  profit diversions so that the amounts to be paid by Chester, IWS, Robert, and 
  his companies are half of those ordered by the trial judge in each case.</p>
<p>
  (f) The Ancaster Property Claim</p>
<p> <a name="568"></a>[568] The trial judge found that Morris transferred this 
  property to Warren because Chester promised that if he did so, Chester would 
  "straighten out" the share sale. She found that both brothers understood that 
  this meant returning the parties to their shareholdings prior to December 22, 
  1983. She concluded that since Chester breached his promise, Morris was entitled 
  to receive damages for breach of contract equal to the value of the property 
  at the time it was transferred to Warren. </p>
<p>
  [569] The appellants argue that the trial judge erred in failing to conclude 
  that this contract was fatally vague. We do not agree. The trial judge had ample 
  evidence to conclude that the brothers fully understood what Chester was obligated 
  to do in return for Morris transferring the property to Warren.</p>
<p>
  [570] The appellants also argue that Morris is not entitled to this relief if 
  he also succeeds in having the court return him to his shareholding position 
  as it existed prior to December 22, 1983. We agree with this and indeed counsel 
  for the respondents candidly conceded as much in argument. In effect, Morris 
  will have received Chester's performance of his promise through court order 
  and should not receive damages as well. Thus we order that the trial judgment 
  be amended in this respect.</p>
<p>
  (g) The Constructive Trust and Tracing Issues</p>
<p> <a name="571"></a>[571] The trial judge's findings of liability in the main 
  action were based fundamentally on breach of fiduciary duty, undue influence, 
  unconscionability, and oppression under s. 248 of the OBCA. While we have not 
  found it necessary to deal with undue influence and unconscionability, the breach 
  of fiduciary duty entitled the court to turn to equitable principles in devising 
  appropriate remedies. So too did s. 248. The task under s. 248 is very much 
  the same since s. 248(3) empowers the court upon a finding of oppression to 
  make any order "it thinks fit". It is important to keep in mind that the various 
  remedies the trial judge ordered were made in this context. </p>
<p>
  [572] In connection with the share sale, the trial judge imposed a constructive 
  trust. She ordered that Chester held fifty per cent of the shares of IWS on 
  constructive trust for Morris from December 22, 1983 (the date of the share 
  sale) to June 27, 2002 (the date of her judgment), when she ordered Chester 
  to transfer the shares from his name to Morris's name. She provided a remedy 
  for the profits and the equity taken out of the company during the existence 
  of the constructive trust by ordering that Morris could elect one of two ways, 
  which she described in detail, for calculating his fifty per cent of those amounts. 
  She then ordered that to recover his share of these post-sale payouts, Morris 
  could elect between a proprietary remedy, namely a constructive trust on his 
  portion of those amounts, or a personal remedy against both Chester and IWS 
  for damages equivalent to his portion of those amounts.</p>
<p>
  [573] In connection with the 1979 bonuses, the trial judge ordered that both 
  Chester and IWS were liable to pay Morris $125,000, which was equivalent to 
  fifty per cent of those bonuses. She ordered that Morris could elect a proprietary 
  remedy as an alternative which would yield an order that Chester had held Morris's 
  $125,000 on constructive trust for Morris since December 17, 1979.</p>
<p>
  [574] For the 1981 and 1982 bonuses her remedies were much the same. Morris 
  was entitled to a personal judgment against Chester for his fifty per cent (less 
  what Morris in fact received) or to elect an order that these sums were subject 
  to a constructive trust. She also held that Robert, Warren, and Gary were personally 
  liable for the bonus amounts they received for 1981 and 1982 (which, as we explained 
  earlier, we have reduced by one-half). </p>
<p>
  [575] The trial judge used the same approach for the profit diversions to Greycliffe 
  and Robert's other companies. Personal remedies were ordered against Chester, 
  IWS, and Robert for Morris's fifty per cent share of those profit diversions 
  and against each of the companies for fifty per cent of the profits they received. 
  She again permitted Morris to instead elect a proprietary remedy and to choose 
  that any portion of his fifty per cent be subject to a constructive trust.</p>
<p>
  [576] The trial judge also ordered Chester to pay punitive damages of $350,000 
  in connection with the share sale, the bonuses, and the profit diversions.</p>
<p>
  [577] Finally, to support the constructive trust remedy, the trial judge ordered 
  a tracing process to permit Morris to attempt to trace the amount subject to 
  constructive trusts into the hands of persons other than bona fide purchasers 
  for value without notice. She also found that none of Robert, Warren, or Gary 
  qualified as such persons. This process would permit Morris to make an informed 
  election between the personal and the proprietary remedies provided for as alternatives 
  by her judgment.</p>
<p>
  [578] The appellants argue that the trial judge erred in several respects in 
  this exercise of her remedial jurisdiction. Before turning to the specific arguments, 
  it is worth reiterating that the remedies ordered all flowed from the trial 
  judge's use of (1) the equitable tools of fiduciary breach, undue influence, 
  and unconscionability and (2) the broad remedial powers given by s. 248 of the 
  OBCA. All her remedies are therefore entitled to significant deference in this 
  court: see McBride Metal Fabricating Corp. v. H &amp; W Sales Co. (2002), 59 
  O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.); Sidaplex-Plastics Suppliers Inc. v. Elta Group Inc. (1998), 
  40 O.R. (3d) 563 (C.A.). </p>
<p>
  [579] The appellants first argue that the trial judge erred in the exercise 
  of her discretion in reinstating Morris as a fifty per cent shareholder with 
  the accompanying share of post-sale profits, since this is a business to which 
  he has not contributed and in whose management he has not participated for twenty 
  years. Rather, Morris should simply be entitled to damages for lost opportunity, 
  measured by the difference between the fair market value of IWS on December 
  23, 1983 and the price set in the share sale agreement.</p>
<p>
  [580] The answer to this is twofold and straightforward. First, it would effectively 
  ignore the trial judge's finding that Morris never intended to sell his shares. 
  Second, as La Forest J. said in Hodgkinson, at 440, equity's objective in a 
  circumstance like this is restitutionary, namely to put Morris in as good a 
  position as he would have been in had the fiduciary breaches not occurred. Moreover, 
  particularly where the breach is found to be dishonest, equity does not permit 
  the failed fiduciary to profit from his wrongdoing. The remedies ordered by 
  the trial judge in relation to the share sale and the post-sale profits accomplish 
  just that. They restore Morris to his ownership position as it was before December 
  23, 1983. They also recognize his entitlement as owner since that time. They 
  permit Chester and his sons reasonable bonuses beyond their generous salaries 
  for their contributions to IWS during the period of the constructive trust. 
  In our view, these remedies are appropriate. They represent no error in the 
  exercise of the trial judge's remedial discretion.</p>
<p>
  [581] The appellants also argue that the trial judge erred in making her tracing 
  orders, saying that she used them as an additional remedy. They contend that 
  a tracing order cannot be used as a remedy, but is merely a process. The appellants 
  also argue that the tracing orders are too invasive of the lives of Chester 
  and his sons to be a proper exercise of judicial discretion. </p>
<p>
  [582] We do not agree. The tracing orders here do not constitute additional 
  remedies. They simply provide the process by which Morris can attempt to trace 
  the property in which he has a beneficial interest through the remedy of constructive 
  trust. If the process is successful, it is the constructive trust that will 
  provide Morris with his remedy should he elect it. As that process unfolds, 
  those into whose hands the property can be traced will be able to advance any 
  defences available to them. </p>
<p>
  [583] While the trial judge has precluded Chester's sons from advancing the 
  defence of being bona fide purchasers for value without notice, her finding 
  in this regard is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence. Her order that the 
  1979 bonuses can be traced into their hands for the purpose of the constructive 
  trust remedy is quite consistent with her finding that they are not personally 
  liable in knowing receipt for these amounts. The former is simply a proprietary 
  remedy based on Chester's breach of fiduciary duty to Morris in paying the 1979 
  bonuses.</p>
<p>
  [584] Nor can it be said that these tracing orders, as invasive as they may 
  be, are so invasive of the lives of Chester and his sons as to be an erroneous 
  exercise of the trial judge's remedial discretion. These orders are the natural 
  corollary of the constructive trust orders made by the trial judge, which in 
  turn are the consequence of the egregious breaches by Chester and his sons of 
  their equitable obligations. </p>
<p>
  [585] The appellants' third submission is that the trial judge erred in ordering 
  punitive damages both because the circumstances lacked the necessary blameworthy 
  conduct and because there was no finding of an actionable wrong independent 
  of the breaches of fiduciary duty found by the trial judge. This argument also 
  fails. The trial judge concluded that Chester's conduct met or surpassed the 
  requirement that it be sufficiently malicious, oppressive, and high-handed as 
  to deserve public censure by the court. On the facts as found, that conclusion 
  is unassailable. </p>
<p>
  [586] Moreover, where liability is founded on breach of fiduciary duty, an independently 
  actionable wrong is not a precondition of punitive damages. Although that is 
  necessary in an action based on breach of contract, where this "private 
  law" agreed to by the parties defines the extent of their obligations to 
  each other, the situation is different where the common law imposes an obligation 
  on one to act as a fiduciary for another. In Norberg v. Wynrib, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 
  226 for example, McLachlin J., writing for herself and L'Heureux-Dub&eacute; 
  J., found an award of punitive damages for breach of fiduciary duty to be appropriate 
  without finding an independently actionable wrong. In doing so, she cited with 
  approval the following passage from M.V. Ellis, Fiduciary Duties in Canada (Don 
  Mills: Richard DeBoo, 1988) at 20-24: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Where the actions of the fiduciary are purposefully repugnant to the beneficiary's 
  best interests, punitive damages are a logical award to be made by the Court. 
  This award will be particularly applicable where the impugned activity is motivated 
  by the fiduciary's self-interest. </p>
<p>
  [587] Finally, in her supplementary reasons, the trial judge makes clear that 
  Robert, Warren, and Gary are personally liable in knowing receipt for the post-sale 
  profits they received. Although the appellants have not raised it, we amend 
  this part of her judgment by ordering that their liability is limited to one-half 
  of the sums so received. We do so on the same basis as we did for the 1981 and 
  1982 bonuses, namely that they could not have had constructive knowledge that 
  any more than one-half of these sums belonged beneficially to Morris.</p>
<p>
  [588] In summary, with the modest exceptions we have set out, we find no error 
  in the trial judge's legal analysis in the main action.</p>
<p>
  [589] We therefore vary the judgment in the main action but only in the following 
  respects: </p>
<p class="indent5"> a) Robert, Warren and Gary are liable for only one half of 
  the 1981 and 1982 bonuses that they received: see para. 556.</p>
<p class="indent5">b) Chester, IWS and Robert and his companies are liable for 
  only one half of the amounts ordered by the trial judge in relation to the Greycliffe 
  profit diversions: see para. 567.</p>
<p class="indent5">c) The order for damages in relation to the Ancaster property 
  is set aside: see para. 570. </p>
<p class="indent5">d) Robert, Warren and Gary are liable for only one half of 
  the post sale profits that they received: see para. 587.</p>
<p>
  C. The Grounds of Appeal Relating to SWRI</p>
<p> <a name="590"></a>[590] Three separate claims in the litigation involved SWRI. 
  In one action, Morris, Michael, and SWRI claimed that Chester, Robert, Gary, 
  and IWS had induced Philip to breach its contract with SWRI. Chester and his 
  children counterclaimed in that action, alleging that their shares in SWRI had 
  been transferred to Michael and Douglas improperly and without their consent. 
  The trial judge found Chester, Robert, and IWS liable to SWRI for inducing the 
  breach of the contract with Philip and assessed damages at large at $2.5 million 
  and punitive damages at $100,000. She dismissed the counterclaim, finding that 
  Chester's children had consented to transfer their shares in SWRI to Morris's 
  sons. </p>
<p>
  [591] In the main action, IWS counterclaimed against SWRI, Morris, Michael, 
  Shirley, and Douglas for theft of its business and corporate opportunities. 
  The trial judge dismissed the counterclaim, except on three minor matters, which 
  are not in question in this appeal. In dismissing the counterclaim she found 
  that Chester and IWS were aware of and consented to SWRI's handling of all of 
  the business that IWS had handled. </p>
<p>
  [592] Chester, Robert, and IWS appeal all three adverse findings. Their three 
  general submissions are: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The trial judge erred in finding Chester, Robert, and IWS 
  liable to SWRI for inducing the breach of its contract with Philip; in the alternative 
  she erred in her assessment of damages. </p>
<p class="indent">2. The trial judge erred in finding that Chester's children 
  consented to the transfer of their shares in SWRI to Michael and Douglas.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The trial judge erred in dismissing IWS's counterclaim for 
  theft of its business and corporate opportunities. </p>
<p>
  The factual background to these three submissions is set out at paragraphs 225 
  to 269 of these reasons.</p>
<p>
  i. The Inducing the Breach of Contract Claim</p>
<p> <a name="593"></a>[593] Beginning in 1982, Morris and then Michael developed 
  a close and valuable business relationship with Alan Fracassi, the principal 
  of Philip. SWRI provided the customers and invoiced them and Philip supplied 
  the trucking services to haul their waste. Morris issued his claim in the main 
  action in 1988 and in January 1989 IWS counterclaimed not only against SWRI, 
  Morris and Michael, but also against Philip for misappropriation of waste accounts 
  allegedly belonging to it. On March 7, 1989, Philip wrote to SWRI terminating 
  their six-year business relationship. That same day, IWS dropped its counterclaim 
  against Philip. The termination of Philip's relationship with SWRI had dramatic 
  financial consequences: SWRI was effectively put out of business, as its profits 
  decreased by ninety per cent, while Philip's profits skyrocketed, nearly doubling 
  in less than a year. </p>
<p>
  [594] It was in this context that the trial judge held IWS, Chester, and Robert 
  liable to SWRI for inducing the breach of its contract with Philip. In so holding 
  she applied the elements of the tort of inducing breach of contract to her factual 
  findings. The appellants do not challenge her legal analysis. Instead, they 
  attack her findings of fact and credibility. For the brief reasons that follow, 
  we conclude that her findings are well supported by the record, disclose no 
  palpable and overriding error and, therefore, are unassailable on appeal. </p>
<p>
  [595] To succeed in its tort action for inducing breach of contract SWRI had 
  to prove these five elements: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. It had a valid and enforceable contract with Philip;</p>
<p class="indent">2. The defendants, IWS, Chester, and Robert, were aware of the 
  existence of this contract;</p>
<p class="indent">3. The defendants procured the breach of the contract;</p>
<p class="indent">4. The breach was effected by wrongful interference on the part 
  of the defendants; and </p>
<p class="indent">5. As a result of the breach it suffered damages.</p>
<p>
  See Posluns v. Toronto Stock Exchange and Gardiner, [1964] 2 O.R. 547 (H.C.), 
  aff'd [1966] 1 O.R. 285 (C.A.), aff'd [1968] S.C.R. 330. The trial judge concluded 
  that SWRI had made out these five elements. We agree with her conclusion. </p>
<p>
  [596] Although Philip and SWRI had exchanged draft agreements, they never formalized 
  their arrangement in a written contract. Nonetheless, the trial judge found 
  that the parties had a valid and enforceable contract arising out of their negotiated 
  agreements to transport and process waste for every major SWRI customer. There 
  is no basis to interfere with that finding. It satisfies the first element of 
  the tort.</p>
<p>
  [597] The appellants acknowledged that they were aware of the contractual relationship 
  between SWRI and Philip. Their awareness satisfies the second element of the 
  tort. </p>
<p>
  [598] Both at trial and on appeal the main issue was whether SWRI had made out 
  the third element of its cause of action: did the appellants procure the breach 
  of the contract? Each side told a different story of why Philip terminated the 
  contract in March 1989. The appellants, bolstered by the testimony of Fracassi, 
  claimed that Philip ended its relationship with SWRI because it discovered that 
  SWRI had "cheated" it on the Lasco contract. According to Fracassi, 
  Michael gave him altered copies of the three agreements between SWRI and Lasco 
  that we referred to earlier - the letter agreement of October 24, 1986, the 
  settlement agreement of February 24, 1987, and the proposed letter of November 
  1988 - to hide the amount of profit SWRI was earning on the Lasco contract. 
  The altered copies showed reduced transportation charges to Lasco for hauling 
  its waste. Fracassi claimed that he first saw authentic copies of these agreements 
  between SWRI and Lasco in reviewing documents given to his lawyer by lawyers 
  for Robert, Chester, and IWS in March 1989. On discovering the discrepancies 
  he severed Philip's relationship with SWRI. </p>
<p>
  [599] Morris and Michael denied the appellants' version of what occurred. They 
  contended that the appellants pressured Philip to sever the relationship in 
  order to drive SWRI out of business. According to Morris and Michael, the appellants 
  offered two inducements: IWS would drop its counterclaim against Philip and 
  IWS would not compete for any of the business that SWRI and Philip had developed, 
  not even business that had originated with IWS. Morris and Michael claimed that 
  Robert altered the Lasco documents in early 1989 and gave them to Fracassi to 
  provide him with a pretext for ending Philip's business relationship with SWRI. 
  </p>
<p>
  [600] The trial judge accepted Morris and Michael's evidence and their account 
  of what occurred. She therefore found that the appellants had procured or caused 
  the breach of the contractual relationship between SWRI and Philip. She wrote: </p>
<p class="indent">
  After February 20, 1989, IWS did not release Philip from its counterclaim until 
  Philip agreed to stop doing business with SWRI. I find that Robert insisted 
  that Philip cease doing business with SWRI as a condition of the dismissal of 
  IWS' counterclaim against it. Philip at first refused to do so, eventually relenting 
  only after Robert provided them with forged documents, which suggested SWRI 
  had defrauded Philip and when Chester/IWS offered other financial incentives 
  (para. 1762).</p>
<p>
  She concluded that the appellants had induced the breach intentionally. At para. 
  1780, she wrote: "The termination of Philip's contractual relationship 
  with SWRI was precisely what Chester and Robert intended. They knew SWRI would 
  be severely damaged as a result." </p>
<p>
  [601] The evidence amply supports the trial judge's conclusion that SWRI had 
  proved the third element of its cause of action. This evidence includes the 
  following: </p>
<p class="indent"> a) The timing of Philip's termination of its relationship with 
  SWRI Philip ended the relationship with SWRI the very day IWS dropped its counterclaim 
  against Philip. The trial judge properly rejected Fracassi's evidence that the 
  timing was a coincidence.</p>
<p class="indent">b) The altering of the Lasco documents </p>
<p class="indent">The appellants alleged that Michael altered the documents and 
  used them to conceal SWRI's profits. Michael denied this allegation and the 
  trial judge accepted his denial, as she was entitled to do. Instead, she found 
  that Robert altered the documents in early 1989 and gave them to Fracassi, who, 
  knowing they were false, used them as a pretext to terminate his relationship 
  with SWRI. Her finding is supported by the invoices SWRI sent to Lasco, which 
  show transportation charges consistent with the authentic agreements; and by 
  the different stories Fracassi and Robert told about how each "discovered" that 
  the Lasco agreements had been altered. According to Robert, he met Fracassi 
  at the Centennial Parkway offices, and in the course of going through files 
  Fracassi had brought with him, discovered that some of the Lasco documents in 
  those files differed from those in SWRI's files. According to Fracassi, however, 
  no such meeting took place. Fracassi said he stopped doing business with SWRI 
  after Robert's lawyers sent the authentic documents to his lawyer and he compared 
  them with the altered documents. Not surprisingly, the trial judge rejected 
  these "confusing, inconsistent and unpersuasive" stories.</p>
<p class="indent">c) Fracassi's first exposure to the altered Lasco documents 
</p>
<p class="indent">This point is closely related to the last point. Fracassi's 
  story hinged on his claim that he received copies of the altered documents at 
  the time each was written, that is, in October 1986, February 1987, and November 
  1988. He said that because he was a joint venture partner with SWRI he received 
  copies of all contracts between SWRI and its customers. </p>
<p class="indent">Two pieces of evidence undermine Fracassi's claim: Michael's 
  evidence, which the trial judge accepted; and the nature of the arrangement 
  between Philip and SWRI on the Lasco account. Although SWRI and Philip were 
  joint venture partners for other customers, on the Lasco account they were contractor 
  and subcontractor. As a subcontractor Philip was not entitled to receive and 
  did not receive copies of the agreements between SWRI and Lasco. </p>
<p class="indent">d) Philip's motive </p>
<p class="indent">Philip obviously had a strong motive to end its contract with 
  SWRI. Because of the appellants' promise not to compete, Philip stood to maintain 
  all the SWRI business and to reap all the profits instead of having to share 
  them.</p>
<p class="indent">e) Philip's termination letter </p>
<p class="indent">This letter made no reference to the altered Lasco documents 
  or to Philip having been cheated as a basis for terminating its relationship 
  with SWRI. </p>
<p>
  [602] SWRI easily established the last two elements of its cause of action. 
  The appellants had no lawful grounds for interfering with the contract between 
  SWRI and Philip, let alone by proffering tampered documents to justify Philip's 
  termination of its relationship with SWRI. And SWRI sustained substantial damages 
  because of the breach of contract: its profits fell by approximately $2.7 million 
  in the first year after the breach. For these reasons we uphold the trial judge's 
  finding of liability. </p>
<p> [603] The appellants argue in the alternative that if they are liable for 
  inducing breach of contract, the damages "at large" awarded by the trial judge, 
  $2.5 million, are excessive and should be substantially reduced. We see no merit 
  in this submission. </p>
<p>
  [604] The trial judge largely accepted the evidence of the respondents' expert, 
  Vettese, and relied on one of his four alternative loss calculations. She set 
  out her key finding at para. 1800 of her reasons: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Based on Michael's evidence, I find that of the four sets of assumptions used 
  by Vettese, the assumptions in Alternative D and damages of $2,770,000 - $2,840,000 
  are the most appropriate. However I find that those assumptions are conservative 
  given the evidence of Michael, which I accept about expectations of growth in 
  the business. Vettese's calculations do not include all of SWRI's customers.</p>
<p>
  After making various adjustments she arrived at a figure of $2.5 million. </p>
<p>
  [605] The appellants challenge the assessment by challenging Vettese's assumptions. 
  In his loss calculation, which was relied on by the trial judge, Vettese assumed 
  that SWRI's customers at the date of breach would continue to do business with 
  SWRI for the expiry of their contract term and an additional renewal term. The 
  appellants submit that this assumption was not reasonable because Lasco, SWRI's 
  most important customer, and perhaps other customers, too were dissatisfied 
  with SWRI's rates and were looking for another waste handler. We do not accept 
  this submission for the simple reason that after the breach Philip maintained 
  the Lasco account and most other SWRI accounts. </p>
<p>
  [606] The appeal against the finding of inducing breach of contract and the 
  award of damages therefore fails. </p>
<p>
  ii. The Share Transfer Issue</p>
<p> <a name="607"></a>[607] As we have said, SWRI was incorporated in 1977 with 
  two thousand preference shares and one hundred common shares. IWS held the preference 
  shares. Ramsay Evans and Hayman, lawyers at the firm of Evans Husband, held 
  the common shares in trust: fifty for Morris's three children and fifty for 
  Chester's four children. By the time of trial, the IWS corporate records showed 
  that the preference shares had been eliminated and that Michael and Douglas 
  owned all of the common shares. </p>
<p>
  [608] The appellants alleged that they discovered this change in SWRI's shareholdings 
  in the summer of 1988. They counterclaimed for misappropriation of their shares 
  in SWRI. They pointed out that there was no board of directors resolution cancelling 
  the preference shares; there were no consents to the transfer of the common 
  shares; and there was no compliance with Article 9 of SWRI's letters patent, 
  which required written evidence of a share transfer. </p>
<p>
  [609] The trial judge dismissed the counterclaim. Although troubled by the absence 
  of corporate records documenting the restructuring, she found that the appellants 
  had knowingly consented to the elimination of the preference shares and the 
  transfer of the common shares. She found that the share restructuring took place 
  in Ennis's law office in 1982 and was backdated to 1979. She also found that 
  Chester actively directed the restructuring, largely to be able to claim that 
  he, his sons and Morris never had anything to do with SWRI, thus permitting 
  them to escape the scrutiny of anyone seeking to enforce the Laidlaw/Superior 
  non-competition covenants. The trial judge ordered that, if necessary, SWRI's 
  minute book and share registry be rectified to reflect what she found was everyone's 
  intention: that Michael and Douglas own and run SWRI, and that IWS, Chester 
  and his children have no further interest in it. </p>
<p>
  [610] The appellants make two arguments on appeal: first, that the trial judge's 
  finding of consent was unsupported by the evidence and contrary to the sworn 
  testimony of Chester's sons; and second, that the transfer of the common shares 
  was ineffective because of non-compliance with Article 9 of SWRI's letters patent. 
  We do not accept either argument.</p>
<p> [611] Ennis's account to Morris dated September 29, 1982, and his handwritten 
  notes show that his office effected the restructuring of SWRI in 1982. The corporate 
  records of SWRI showed that the restructuring was backdated to August 1, 1979. 
  A minute of that date shows that Hayman,<a href="#a">[2]</a><a name="2f"></a> 
  as trustee, transferred fifty common shares to Michael Waxman and fifty common 
  shares in trust to Cook, a legal assistant in Ennis's office. A later minute 
  dated May 4, 1981 shows that Cook transferred the fifty shares she held in trust 
  to Douglas Waxman. </p>
<p>
  [612] The principal question the trial judge had to resolve was whether Chester's 
  sons consented to the transfer of their common shares to Morris's sons. The 
  secondary question was who bore responsibility for eliminating IWS's ownership 
  of the preference shares. </p>
<p> [613] In support of their claim that Morris orchestrated the restructuring 
  of SWRI without their consent, the appellants pointed to the following evidence: 
  the sworn testimony of Chester's sons that they did not consent to the transfer 
  of their shares; Ennis's evidence that he took instructions on the restructuring 
  from Morris and Ennis's September 29, 1982 account, which was sent only to Morris; 
  the absence of any written consent; and the absence of any corporate records 
  reflecting the elimination of the preference shares. </p>
<p>
  [614] The trial judge, nevertheless, found that Chester directed the restructuring 
  of SWRI, including eliminating the preference shares, and that Chester's children 
  consented to transfer their common shares to their cousins. In our view, her 
  findings are not tainted by any palpable and overriding error. Instead, they 
  are supported by several important pieces of evidence. </p>
<p>
  a) The Evidence of Hayman</p>
<p>
  [615] Hayman, whose evidence the trial judge accepted, testified that though 
  he could not recall obtaining the consent of Chester's children or signing backdated 
  documents, his normal practice was to seek consents from the beneficiaries before 
  signing off on their behalf or agreeing to a backdating and he could think of 
  no reason why he would depart from his practice in this case. As we have said 
  at para. 337 of these reasons, Hayman's evidence of his normal practice may 
  not be especially strong evidence but it is some evidence of what occurred. 
  </p>
<p>
  b) The Timing of the Restructuring</p>
<p>
  [616] The restructuring took place in 1982. At that time SWRI was a near dormant 
  company with revenues of less that $40,000. It had no value to Chester or Robert. 
  </p>
<p>
  c) The Reasons for the Restructuring</p>
<p>
  [617] The trial judge accepted Morris's evidence that the restructuring of both 
  the common and preference shares was done for two main reasons: to ensure that 
  IWS, Chester, Robert, and Morris had no connection to the company and, therefore, 
  could not be found in breach of the non-competition covenants with Laidlaw/Superior; 
  and to give Michael a business to pursue, which would keep him away from IWS. 
  These reasons for the restructuring provided cogent support for the trial judge's 
  key finding of consent.</p>
<p>
  d) Chester's Role in Business Decisions Affecting IWS</p>
<p>
  [618] The trial judge rejected Ennis's evidence that Chester played no role 
  in the restructuring and instead found that he actively directed it. This finding 
  was open to her on the evidence. Indeed, it was consistent with Ennis's acknowledgement 
  that Chester was actively involved in all important business decisions affecting 
  IWS. </p>
<p>
  e) The Active Operations of SWRI</p>
<p>
  [619] SWRI carried on an active business from offices at the Centennial Parkway 
  building, as did IWS and Robert. It defies credulity that Chester did not know 
  until the litigation started who owned and ran SWRI. </p>
<p>
  f) The Disappearance of the Written Consents and Other Records of SWRI Reflecting 
  the Restructuring</p>
<p>
  [620] In 1988 or 1989, after the litigation started, Robert Waxman went to the 
  Evans Husband law office and went through the original SWRI file. The trial 
  judge found that when he did so, he removed the consents. This finding was based 
  on the evidence of opportunity and Robert's answers on his cross-examination, 
  referred to at para. 1902 of the trial judge's reasons: </p>
<p class="indent"> A. There may have been a file there one day I was there with 
  Ross Husband.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Right. And I suggest to you you were allowed to look through 
  it?</p>
<p class="indent">A. I don't know if I looked through it or not.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Is it reasonably possible that you did?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Not necessarily.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Do you deny looking through it?</p>
<p class="indent">A. No, I don't.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And in fact, did you take documents out of that file?</p>
<p class="indent">A. No.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. Are you sure?</p>
<p class="indent">A. No [emphasis in original].</p>
<p>
  [621] The appellants urged that the trial judge misunderstood the significance 
  of Robert's second "No". As we have said at para. 362 she may well 
  have misapprehended this piece of evidence. But in the light of the evidence 
  of opportunity and the trial judge's overall assessment of Robert's credibility, 
  she committed no palpable and overriding error in inferring that Robert used 
  his review of the SWRI files to purloin the consents. </p>
<p>
  [622] For all these reasons, the appellants' attack on the trial judge's finding 
  of fact that they consented to the restructuring of SWRI must fail. </p>
<p>
  [623] Nor can the appellants succeed in their alternative argument that the 
  restructuring did not comply with Article 9 of SWRI's letters patent. Article 
  9 provides that no share should be transferred "without the sanction of 
  the directors of the Corporation expressed either by resolution passed by the 
  board or by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by a majority of 
  the directors". The records of SWRI produced at trial did not contain any 
  documents transferring the common shares that would satisfy Article 9. Similarly, 
  the records of SWRI did not contain a board resolution or other document cancelling 
  IWS's preference share certificate.</p>
<p>
  [624] Still, the validity of the restructuring depended not on formal documentation, 
  but on the consent of the shareholders. Consent is a question of fact. And as 
  we have already said, the trial judge's finding of consent is supported by the 
  evidence, and reflects no palpable error. </p>
<p>
  [625] Moreover, we agree with the trial judge that s. 250 of the OBCA gave her 
  the discretion to rectify SWRI's corporate records to give effect to the restructuring 
  she found had occurred. Sections 250(1) and (2)(a) provide: </p>
<p class="indent"> 250. (1) Where the name of a person is alleged to be or have 
  been wrongly entered or retained in, or wrongly deleted or wrongly omitted from, 
  the registers or other records of a corporation, the corporation, a security 
  holder of the corporation or any aggrieved person may apply to the court for 
  an order that the registers or records be rectified.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) In connection with an application under this section, the 
  court may make any order it thinks fit including, without limiting the generality 
  of the foregoing,</p>
<p class="indent10">(a) an order requiring the registers or other records of the 
  corporation to be rectified;</p>
<p class="center">. . . </p>
<p>The discretion vested in the court under this section is broad: 
  see Re Teddy Bear Valley Mines Ltd., [1993] O.J. No. 1588 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)). 
  This discretion supports the trial judge's rectification order. </p>
<p>
  [626] Accordingly, we do not give effect to the appellants' appeal from the 
  dismissal of their counterclaim for misappropriation of the shares of SWRI.</p>
<p>
  iii. The IWS Claim for Theft of Business and Corporate Opportunities. </p>
<p> <a name="627"></a>[627] The appellants did not press this submission in oral 
  argument. In their factum, however, they contended that Morris breached his 
  fiduciary duty to IWS by misappropriating waste accounts and other corporate 
  opportunities belonging to it for the benefit of SWRI. They submit that the 
  trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of fiduciary duty. They focus 
  on four particular waste accounts: Stelco, Proctor and Gamble, Domtar, and Munroe. 
</p>
<p>
  [628] In advancing this submission the appellants rely on the principle exemplified 
  in Canadian Aero Service Ltd. v. O'Malley, [1974] S.C.R. 592: a person owing 
  a fiduciary duty to a company is precluded from appropriating for himself property, 
  a business advantage, or corporate opportunities belonging to the company. A 
  fiduciary who does so must disgorge the misappropriated profits. This principle 
  seeks to avoid conflicts between a fiduciary's personal interest and duty to 
  the company. </p>
<p>
  [629] Morris Waxman was a director and then the president of IWS. He therefore 
  owed a fiduciary duty to IWS during the period he transferred waste accounts 
  belonging to IWS to SWRI, the company run by his sons. </p>
<p>
  [630] However, Morris has a defence to his transfer of IWS's accounts to SWRI: 
  the informed consent of the shareholders of IWS. The only two shareholders of 
  IWS were Morris and Chester. The trial judge found as a fact that Chester and 
  IWS actively consented to the business activities of SWRI and the transfer of 
  the accounts from IWS to SWRI. She specifically found that Chester and IWS consented 
  to the transfer of the four waste accounts singled out by the appellants. The 
  absence of a directors' or shareholders' resolution formalizing IWS's and Chester's 
  consent was immaterial because consent is a question of fact, and in a closely-held 
  company such as IWS, where the brothers had ongoing discussions about the company's 
  business, a formal resolution would not be expected. </p>
<p>
  [631] Thus the appellants' submission that the trial judge erred in finding 
  Morris did not breach his fiduciary duty to IWS is nothing more than an attack 
  on the trial judge's finding of consent. Yet that finding is amply supported 
  by the evidence. As the trial judge pointed out, Chester had several good reasons 
  for consenting to the transfer of IWS's waste accounts to SWRI. Chester wanted 
  to mollify his brother about the share sale; he considered the waste business 
  unimportant and had no interest in it; he wanted a corporate vehicle to keep 
  Michael away from IWS; and the non-competition covenants with Laidlaw/Superior 
  precluded IWS from handling many of these waste accounts, one of which was Stelco. 
  </p>
<p>
  [632] The appellants did not demonstrate that the trial judge made any reviewable 
  error in her finding of consent. They submit, however, that to avoid liability 
  for breach of fiduciary duty, Morris needed more than the informed consent of 
  the shareholders. He also had to show that IWS was not in the waste business 
  or had wholly withdrawn from it. The appellants say Morris could not do this 
  because IWS remained in the waste business. </p>
<p>
  [633] As the trial judge accurately pointed out, the case law does not support 
  this second requirement. Informed consent alone provides a defence even if the 
  fiduciary is pursuing a business opportunity that conflicts with the business 
  of the company: see Canadian Aero Services v. O'Malley, supra at p. 606. </p>
<p>
  [634] Moreover, even if Morris had to satisfy this second requirement, the trial 
  judge found as a fact that he did so. IWS did not carry on and did not intend 
  to carry on a broad-ranging waste management business. It engaged in a very 
  limited waste business for a few of its scrap metal customers. The trial judge 
  found that the specialized industrial waste business pursued by SWRI did not 
  overlap with the limited waste business undertaken by IWS. We have no basis 
  to set aside this finding. </p>
<p>
  [635] For these reasons the appeal of the dismissal of the counterclaim for 
  misappropriation of IWS's waste accounts fails.</p>
<p>
  D. The Wrongful Dismissal Appeal</p>
<p> <a name="636"></a>[636] In Morris's action for wrongful dismissal, the trial 
  judge found that he was dismissed by IWS without cause on October 26, 1988. 
  She awarded Morris $64,672 in damages based on two years' notice. She calculated 
  this using only his basic annual salary of $33,185 exclusive of any draws or 
  other special payments from IWS, which he typically received prior to his discharge. 
  She did so on the basis that the latter would be encompassed in the determination 
  of post-sale profits described previously.</p>
<p>
  [637] We see no basis to quarrel with either the notice period or the damage 
  calculation and indeed the appellant IWS raises neither in argument.</p>
<p>
  [638] The appellant company contests only the findings of fact that sustain 
  the trial judge's conclusion, particularly those in relation to SWRI, which 
  it says constitute cause. Second, it argues that Morris's conduct after his 
  discharge should be found to constitute just cause.</p>
<p>
  [639] We have already found that there is no basis to interfere with the findings 
  of fact by the trial judge. And there is simply no basis in law to find that 
  his conduct after termination can constitute just cause for his earlier dismissal. 
  </p>
<p>
  E. Ennis's Appeal</p>
<p> <a name="640"></a>[640] As we have already noted, Ennis had been the Waxman 
  family's lawyer for many years. On the share sale he acted for both Morris and 
  Chester. In 1989, Morris and Morriston sued Ennis in a separate action for failing 
  to meet his legal obligations in connection with the share sale and lease. </p>
<p>
  [641] The trial judge found Ennis liable for breach of fiduciary duty, breach 
  of contract, and negligence. She largely rejected his explanation for his actions. 
  She concluded that he should not have acted for either brother on the sale because 
  of the inevitable conflict in acting for both. She found that, having decided 
  to act, he failed to meet even his most minimal obligations to Morris, including 
  failing to explain to him the share sale and lease documents. </p>
<p>
  [642] The trial judge concluded that had Ennis met his legal obligations, Morris 
  would not have sold his shares and Morriston would not have signed the lease. 
  Because of Ennis's breach of his fiduciary duty, Morris lost the profits from 
  his one-half interest in IWS and Morriston incurred losses on the December 1983 
  lease. The trial judge found Ennis jointly and severally liable for those losses 
  in the same amount that she had found Chester liable in the main action. </p>
<p>
  [643] Ennis appeals both the finding of liability against him and the damages 
  award. His appeal on liability depends on overturning the trial judge's finding 
  that Morris did not know that he was selling his shares. His appeal on damages 
  seeks to limit the equitable damages ordered by the trial judge or to substitute 
  common law damages. </p>
<p>
  i. Ennis's Appeal on Liability</p>
<p> <a name="644"></a>[644] Ennis challenges several adverse findings of fact 
  made by the trial judge. But his counsel fairly concedes that, if this court 
  upholds the trial judge's finding that Morris did not know he was selling his 
  shares, Ennis cannot succeed on his appeal against liability. </p>
<p>
  [645] We have upheld the trial judge's finding that Morris did not know that 
  he was selling his shares. Combined with Ennis's admission that he acted for 
  Morris and Chester on the share sale, that finding is fatal to his appeal on 
  liability. </p>
<p>
  [646] Ennis acknowledges that he had a fiduciary duty to Morris in connection 
  with the share sale. At the heart of the fiduciary duty lies the duty of loyalty, 
  which includes the duty to avoid conflicting interests: see R. v. Neil, [2002] 
  3 S.C.R. 631 and Davey v. Woolley, Hames, Dale &amp; Dingwall (1982), 35 O.R. 
  (2d) 599 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1982), 37 O.R. (2d) 499n. 
  Ordinarily a lawyer should not act on both sides of a transaction where the 
  interests of one client potentially conflict with the interests of the other. 
  If there are some simple or routine transactions where a lawyer can act for 
  both parties, the share sale is not one of them. In a transaction of this magnitude 
  Ennis simply could not act for Chester and Morris. By doing so he put himself 
  into a hopeless conflict of interest, and, as the trial judge found, he severely 
  compromised his representation of Morris. The trial judge was unquestionably 
  correct in concluding that merely by acting on the sale, Ennis breached his 
  fiduciary duty to Morris. </p>
<p>
  [647] Moreover, having decided to act, Ennis breached even the most basic obligations 
  of a lawyer to his client. Three obligations in particular come to mind. First, 
  Ennis did not raise with Morris the problem in acting for both him and his brother. 
  He did not explain the potential conflict, nor did he obtain Morris's consent 
  to act for both sides. Rather than recommend that Morris obtain independent 
  legal advice, Ennis arranged for Morris to sign a waiver of such advice. This 
  waiver was ineffective because it was uninformed, and, in any event, was obtained 
  only after the share sale documents had been signed. </p>
<p>
  [648] Second, Ennis showed no commitment to Morris's cause and, correspondingly, 
  Morris did not receive from Ennis the zealous representation to which he was 
  entitled. Ennis did not explain to Morris the pitfalls and dangers of the share 
  sale: see Clarence Construction Ltd. v. Lavallee (1980), 111 D.L.R. (3d) 582 
  (B.C.S.C.), aff'd (1981), 132 D.L.R. (3d) 153 (B.C.C.A.). He did not discuss 
  the terms of the sale with Morris, much less review the share sale documents 
  with him. He did not even discuss the clearly one-sided nature of virtually 
  every term of the lease (see para. 164 of our reasons). Instead he sat silently 
  at the meeting on December 22, 1983 when the documents were signed, thereby 
  lending a false aura of normalcy to the closing, as the trial judge found. </p>
<p>
  [649] Third, Ennis showed no regard for his obligation of candour to Morris. 
  As the trial judge accurately observed, quoting La Forest J. in Hodgkinson, 
  at 452, the duty to disclose "lies at the core of the fiduciary principle." 
  Ennis could not keep from Morris any relevant information that he received from 
  Chester. Yet the trial judge detailed nine pieces of relevant information that 
  Ennis did not disclose to Morris (para. 2295). These included the fact that 
  Morris was being asked to sign documents selling his shares, the fact that the 
  $3 million sale price did not reflect the 1979 and 1981-2 bonus allocations, 
  details about the terms of the lease with Morriston, and Linton's valuation 
  memo of November 1982. The trial judge's findings on Ennis's non-disclosure 
  are amply supported by the record. </p>
<p>
  [650] For all these reasons we decline to give effect to Ennis's appeal on liability.</p>
<p>
  ii. Ennis's Appeal on Damages</p>
<p> <a name="651"></a>[651] The basic rule of equitable compensation is that the 
  injured party will be reimbursed for all losses flowing directly from the breach. 
  The trial judge applied this principle in assessing damages against Ennis for 
  breach of his fiduciary duty. She held that from the time of the share sale 
  onwards Morris was deprived of all the benefits of his fifty per cent ownership 
  in IWS. The loss of these benefits flowed directly from Ennis's breach. Thus, 
  together with Chester, Ennis was jointly and severally liable for these losses. 
  He was also jointly and severally liable to Morris and Morriston for any losses 
  flowing from the December 1983 lease.</p>
<p>
  [652] Ennis contends that the trial judge's award of damages should be reduced 
  for any one of three reasons. First, he submits that the proper measure of damages 
  is the difference (if any) between the price at which Morris sold his shares 
  in IWS and the fair market value of those shares in December 1983. Second, he 
  submits that the trial judge erred in failing to consider that he neither controlled 
  nor profited from the business of IWS. Third, he submits that the trial judge 
  erred in failing to apply the common law principles that limit damages. We do 
  not accept the first two submissions, but we do give effect to the third.</p>
<p>
  [653] Ennis's first submission ignores the findings of the trial judge and the 
  principles of equitable compensation. The trial judge found that had Ennis fulfilled 
  his fiduciary duty Morris would not have sold his shares to his brother. Fixing 
  damages at the difference between the sale price and the fair market value of 
  the shares assumes a contrary finding: that Morris wanted to sell his shares 
  and, but for Ennis's breach of duty, would have obtained a better price. </p>
<p>
  [654] Moreover, the trial judge found that Ennis breached his fiduciary duty, 
  which is a duty that lies in equity. Therefore, at least as a starting point, 
  Ennis's damages must be assessed as the trial judge assessed them: damages flowing 
  from Morris's loss of his fifty per cent interest in IWS. Morris is entitled 
  to be put in as good a position as he would have been in if the breach had not 
  occurred and he had remained a half-owner of the family business. Accordingly, 
  we see no merit in Ennis's first submission. </p>
<p>
  [655] Ennis's second submission seeks to reduce the award of damages because 
  he had no control over IWS and did not profit from the business as Chester did. 
  In our view, neither of these factors affords a basis in equity to reduce the 
  award. </p>
<p>
  [656] That Ennis had no control over or interest in IWS leads to but a single 
  difference between the award against him and the award against Chester. Chester 
  was required to convey fifty per cent of his shares of IWS to Morris. Ennis, 
  obviously, had no such shares to transfer, nor was he required to pay Morris 
  the value of his fifty per cent interest. Otherwise, in our opinion, the damages 
  Ennis is required to pay should not be reduced because he did not exert any 
  control over IWS. </p>
<p>
  [657] Admittedly, in Canson Enterprises Ltd. v. Boughton &amp; Co., [1991] 3 
  S.C.R. 534, La Forest J. observed at 578 that "[t]here is a sharp divide 
  between a situation where a person has control of property which in the view 
  of the court belongs to another, and one where a person is under a fiduciary 
  duty to perform an obligation where equity's concern is simply that the duty 
  be performed honestly and in accordance with the undertaking the fiduciary has 
  taken on". But he made this observation simply to reject the argument that 
  the remedy for breach of fiduciary duty should automatically be the same as 
  the remedy for breach of trust. In breach of trust cases the object of the trust 
  must be restored to the beneficiary, or, if that is not possible, the beneficiary 
  must be compensated for the value of the object. In breach of fiduciary duty 
  cases the court assesses the losses flowing from the breach. </p>
<p>
  [658] Likewise, a damages award lower than that made against Chester should 
  not be made against Ennis simply because he did not profit from the business 
  of IWS. Lack of profit does not automatically reduce equitable compensation 
  for breach of fiduciary duty. Canson itself makes this clear. In that case the 
  defendant, a solicitor, failed to tell his clients of the secret profit earned 
  by a third party when the solicitor acted for them in buying a piece of land. 
  The clients were entitled to recover the secret profit. That was not disputed. 
  What was disputed was whether they could recover more because of the solicitor's 
  admitted breach of fiduciary duty. The court did not bar further recovery for 
  breach of fiduciary duty simply because the solicitor had not benefitted from 
  the breach of fiduciary duty, though on the facts further recovery was denied. 
  For these reasons, we decline to give effect to Ennis's second submission.</p>
<p>
  [659] That brings us to Ennis's third submission: that the amount of equitable 
  compensation awarded by the trial judge should be reduced because of limiting 
  common law principles such as remoteness, causation and intervening act. Based 
  on the Supreme Court's decisions in Canson and Hodgkinson, we accept this submission. 
  </p>
<p>
  [660] Traditionally, these common law limiting principles had no place in equity. 
  The rationale for keeping these concerns out of equity has been the desire to 
  enforce fiduciaries' strict standards of good faith. But as Canadian law has 
  changed to permit plaintiffs to sue "in whatever manner they find most 
  advantageous", correspondingly courts have recognized - as La Forest J. 
  said in Hodgkinson at 444 - that "equity is flexible enough to borrow from 
  the common law." Increasingly, courts seek to achieve similar compensation 
  for "similar wrongs", whether the action is framed in contract or 
  tort or as breach of fiduciary duty. Indeed, as La Forest J. commented in Canson 
  at 587: "[I]t would be odd if a different result followed depending solely 
  on the manner in which one framed an identical claim. What is required is a 
  measure of rationalization." </p>
<p>
  [661] Our former colleague, Finlayson J.A., made the same point in Martin v. 
  Goldfarb (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.) when he approved the following passage 
  from the reasons of the trial judge in that case at 173: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Regardless of the doctrinal underpinning, plaintiffs should not be able to recover 
  higher damage awards merely because their claim is characterized as breach of 
  fiduciary duty, as opposed to breach of contract or tort. The objective of the 
  expansion of the concept of fiduciary relationship was not to provide plaintiffs 
  with the means to exact higher damages than were already available to them under 
  contract or tort law. </p>
<p>
  [662] Thus, both the Supreme Court of Canada and this court have applied common 
  law principles to limit equitable compensation. Their application is subject 
  to two overriding considerations. First, the court can consider the principles 
  of "remoteness, causation, and intervening act where necessary to reach 
  a just and fair result": see Hodgkinson at 443. Second, these principles 
  should be applied only if doing so does not raise any policy concerns: see Canson 
  at 581 and Hunt v. TD Securities Inc. (2003), 66 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.) at 506.</p>
<p>
  [663] We apply these principles to the award against Ennis. We do so giving 
  a measure of deference to the trial judge's assessment. In our view, the principle 
  of intervening act warrants reducing the damages award. Specifically, we consider 
  Chester's repeated assurances to Morris that the share sale would be rectified 
  to be an intervening act that should limit the award of damages against Ennis. 
  </p>
<p>
  [664] Morris learned the truth about what he had signed from Taylor and Wiseman 
  in January 1984. He immediately objected to the sale and wanted it set aside. 
  He knew then the facts grounding a cause of action against Ennis and Chester. 
  But he did not sue them because Chester assured him that they would resolve 
  the matter privately, consistent with the Waxman family culture. Importantly, 
  the trial judge found at para. 1518 that "Morris was unduly influenced 
  by Chester and was not free of that influence until approximately the time he 
  filed suit. He did not seek legal advice because Chester led him on and because 
  he mistakenly believed that Chester would voluntarily 'straighten out.'" 
  The trial judge made no finding that Ennis led Morris on or that Ennis gave 
  Morris any false assurances. Instead, Chester's conduct - and Chester's conduct 
  alone - caused Morris to put off seeking legal advice or issuing a statement 
  of claim. For this reason, Chester's defence based on Morris's post-sale conduct 
  failed. </p>
<p>
  [665] Chester's assurances to Morris, his leading him on, amount to an intervening 
  act for which Ennis should not be held responsible. Ennis had no control over 
  Chester's conduct and he is entitled to point to that conduct to limit the award 
  of damages against him: see McKittericket al. v. Duco, Geist and Chodos et al. 
  (1994), 76 O.A.C. 310. The trial judge did not consider this intervening act 
  and her failure to do so justifies our intervening in the award. </p>
<p>
  [666] Finally, we must fix a cut-off point for the damages award against Ennis. 
  Any point necessarily entails a measure of arbitrariness, but we think it is 
  fair to assess Morris's damages against Ennis in the amount of his losses from 
  being deprived of a fifty per cent interest in IWS and from the December 1983 
  lease, to the end of January 1985. We choose that date for three reasons: First, 
  less than a month after having signed the share sale and lease documents Morris 
  knew that his brother had cheated him. From then on Morris's focus became not 
  so much Chester's trickery but whether Chester would make good on his assurance 
  that he would undo the sale. Ennis played no role in this.</p>
<p>
  [667] Second, even if Chester had acted on his assurance, undoing the sale would 
  have perhaps taken up to a year. Ennis must bear responsibility for this time 
  period.</p>
<p>
  [668] Third, after finding out that his brother would not undo the share sale, 
  Morris was entitled to a reasonable time to consider what to do. In the light 
  of these considerations, fixing a January 31, 1985 cut-off date for the damages 
  award against Ennis seems to be reasonable. </p>
<p>
  [669] We see no policy concerns standing in the way of this award. Morris still 
  recovers the full amount of his losses from Chester. Ennis must still pay a 
  substantial amount, but is responsible only for the earlier portion of Morris's 
  losses, not the later portion attributable to Chester's assurances. And Ennis 
  is not penalized for his breach. Instead, the award against him is closely tied 
  to the duty that he violated. </p>
<p>
  iii. Conclusion</p>
<p> <a name="670"></a>[670] In the light of the findings of the trial judge and 
  Ennis's admission that he acted for both brothers on the share sale, we dismiss 
  Ennis's appeal against liability. We allow his appeal against damages in part. 
  Because we consider Chester's assurances to Morris that the share sale would 
  be undone to be an intervening act for which Ennis cannot be held accountable, 
  we reduce the damages payable by him to all losses flowing to Morris from having 
  been deprived of a fifty per cent interest in IWS and from the lease, to the 
  end of January 1985. Ennis is jointly and severally liable for those losses. 
  If the parties cannot agree on the amount we direct a reference to quantify 
  these damages.</p>
<p>
  F. Morris's Appeal Against Taylor Leibow</p>
<p> <a name="671"></a>[671] In a separate action Morris and Morriston, sued IWS's 
  long-time auditor, Taylor Leibow, for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. 
  Morris advanced two principal claims: first, Taylor Leibow failed to ensure 
  that IWS's financial statements properly reflected related-party transactions, 
  especially transactions with Greycliffe, or to bring the extent of these related-party 
  transactions to his attention; and second, Taylor Leibow failed to discuss the 
  bonuses with Morris.</p>
<p>
  [672] The trial judge dismissed both claims. She found that if Taylor Leibow 
  owed a duty of care to Morris, it breached that duty by failing to advise him 
  that the related-party transactions between Greycliffe and IWS were not at fair 
  market value, and by failing to advise him that IWS had paid out excessive bonuses, 
  to his detriment. However, applying the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in 
  Hercules Managements Ltd. v. Ernst &amp; Young, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 165, she held 
  that though Taylor Leibow owed Morris a prima facie duty of care, that prima 
  facie duty was ousted by policy concerns about indeterminate liability. She 
  also held that Taylor Leibow did not owe a fiduciary duty to Morris. Additionally, 
  she held that Morris's claim on the related-party transactions with Greycliffe 
  was barred by an agreement and undertaking that he had signed in 1998 in order 
  to obtain copies of Taylor Leibow's working papers.</p>
<p>
  [673] Morris appeals and Taylor Leibow cross-appeals. The overriding issue on 
  the appeal is whether the trial judge erred in holding that Taylor Leibow did 
  not have a duty to warn Morris about the related-party transactions with Greycliffe 
  or about the bonuses. In contending that she erred, Morris makes four submissions: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The trial judge erred in relying on Hercules to limit the 
  scope of Taylor Leibow's liability.</p>
<p class="indent">2. The trial judge erred in failing to hold that Taylor Leibow 
  owed a duty to Morris separate and apart from its role as auditor of IWS, based 
  on its historical relationship with Morris and Chester.</p>
<p class="indent">3. The trial judge erred in failing to find that Taylor Leibow 
  owed a fiduciary duty to Morris.</p>
<p class="indent">4. The trial judge erred in finding that Taylor Leibow could 
  rely on the agreement and undertaking in defence to Morris's claim on the related-party 
  transactions.</p>
<p>
  [674] Taylor Leibow seeks to uphold the trial judge's finding that it owed no 
  duty to Morris and her finding on the agreement and undertaking. Moreover, on 
  its cross-appeal it seeks to set aside her findings of negligence on the ground 
  that they are not supported by the evidence. </p>
<p>
  i. Background</p>
<p> <a name="675"></a>[675] Taylor Leibow audited IWS's financial statements annually 
  for over thirty years. It also audited the statements of the companies related 
  to IWS, including Greycliffe. From the 1940s to the late 1970s, Taylor was the 
  partner in charge of the audits. From the late 1970s on, Wiseman took over as 
  the partner in charge, though Taylor was consulted and gave advice from time 
  to time.</p>
<p>
  [676] Beyond auditing IWS and the related companies, Taylor Leibow was retained 
  to give advice on special projects, for example the Lasco and Laidlaw transactions. 
  It gave advice about the estate freeze that Chester and Morris considered in 
  the 1970s. And it annually reviewed the individual tax returns of Morris and 
  Chester.</p>
<p>
  ii. The Trial Judge's Negligence Findings</p>
<p> <a name="677"></a>[677] To put Morris's submissions in context, we will briefly 
  review the trial judge's findings of negligence. These findings assume, of course, 
  that Taylor Leibow had a duty of care to warn him about the related-party transactions 
  with Greycliffe and the bonuses. </p>
<p>
  (a) Findings on the Related-Party Transactions</p>
<p> <a name="678"></a>[678] The 1981 financial statement of Greycliffe prepared 
  by Wiseman included a related-party note, which read as follows: "The rates 
  charged by the company are at market value for services rendered." </p>
<p>
  [679] The 1980, 1981, and 1982 financial statements of IWS, prepared by Linton 
  and audited by Taylor Leibow, contained no related-party notes about the transactions 
  between IWS and Greycliffe. In these transactions, according to the trial judge's 
  findings, Robert had diverted IWS profits of over $2.3 million to Greycliffe 
  and his other companies by the end of 1983. </p>
<p>
  [680] In light of the note on the 1981 Greycliffe financial statement and the 
  absence of any related-party notes on the IWS statements, the trial judge concluded 
  that Taylor Leibow fell below the standard of a reasonably competent auditor. 
  If Taylor Leibow owed a duty of care to Morris personally then it was liable 
  in negligence, either for failing to include a related-party note on the IWS 
  statements or for failing to alert Morris to its suspicions about the fairness 
  of Greycliffe's rates. In so concluding, the trial judge rejected Wiseman's 
  evidence that he saw no reason to discuss the fairness of Greycliffe's rates 
  with Morris because Morris knew what was going on in both companies. </p>
<p> [681] The trial judge's conclusion was amply supported by the evidence. This 
  evidence included: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Morris's expert, Al Rosen, whose opinion evidence the trial judge accepted, 
    testified that the 1981 Greycliffe note was a "very strong note". Under generally 
    accepted standards of auditing, the note required Taylor Leibow to gather 
    enough external corroborative evidence to verify its accuracy. Taylor Leibow 
    had to verify that Greycliffe was charging and IWS was paying fair market 
    rates. This it did not do. </li>
  <li>Because haulage costs amounted to over seven per cent of IWS revenues, Rosen 
    also testified that, in his view, IWS's related-party transactions with Greycliffe 
    were material and should have been disclosed in the 1981/1982 financial statements.</li>
  <li>Linton told Wiseman that Robert preferred not to include a related party 
    note on the IWS financial statements. In Rosen's opinion, this preference 
    for non-disclosure would have raised the suspicions of any reasonable auditor. 
  </li>
  <li>In 1982 an employee of Taylor Leibow, Demers, concluded that IWS's financial 
    statements should have reflected the company's related-party transactions 
    with Greycliffe. </li>
  <li>Taylor Leibow's 1982 working papers included an organization chart for IWS, 
    which showed Morris's diminished role in the company.</li>
  <li>Wiseman was concerned enough about Greycliffe's charges to IWS that he spoke 
    to Taylor about them. Taylor then apparently spoke to Chester, but neither 
    Taylor nor Wiseman spoke to Morris. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  (b) Findings on the Bonuses</p>
<p> <a name="682"></a>[682] Taylor Leibow was not consulted about the 1981/1982 
  bonuses before they were declared or about the 1983 reallocation of Morris's 
  bonus. However, it became aware of the bonuses and the reallocation during its 
  audits. The trial judge found that by early 1982, Wiseman knew from his audit 
  of IWS that much of the company's equity (attributable to the proceeds of the 
  Lasco and Laidlaw sales) had been distributed, apparently without justification, 
  to Chester's sons. She therefore concluded that if Taylor Leibow owed a duty 
  of care to Morris, it was negligent in failing to discuss with him both the 
  1981/1982 bonuses and the 1983 reallocation of Morris's own bonus.</p>
<p>
  (c) Findings on Causation and Remedy</p>
<p> <a name="683"></a>[683] The trial judge concluded that if Taylor Leibow had 
  voiced its concerns about the related-party transactions and the bonuses to 
  Morris, then his trust and confidence in his brother would have been eroded. 
  The trial judge inferred that had this happened, Morris would have obtained 
  independent legal and financial advice or would have talked to Michael. In the 
  trial judge's view, had Morris done either, the share sale would not have occurred. 
</p>
<p>
  [684] The trial judge did not assess damages against Taylor Leibow in connection 
  with the related-party transactions and bonuses. However, in the light of her 
  findings on causation, and assuming Taylor Leibow owed Morris a duty of care, 
  presumably the trial judge would have awarded damages against the auditor in 
  amounts similar to those she awarded against Chester. </p>
<p>
  [685] In this court, Mr. Harrison fairly acknowledges that the trial judge's 
  conclusion on causation may not be supportable because of concerns about remoteness. 
  Therefore, on appeal, Mr. Harrison limits the remedy he seeks for his client 
  to discrete sums for the failure to warn about IWS's transactions with Greycliffe 
  and about the bonuses. For the profits Greycliffe diverted from IWS, Morris 
  asks for damages of $1,180,073 and for the excessive bonus payments he seeks 
  damages of $2,312,000. These amounts track the amounts awarded against Chester 
  and IWS.</p>
<p>
  iii. Analysis</p>
<p>
  (a) Did the Trial Judge Err in Relying on Hercules to Limit the Scope of Taylor 
  Leibow's Liability?</p>
<p> <a name="686"></a>[686] Morris's principal submission is that the trial judge 
  erred in relying on the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Hercules to conclude 
  that Taylor Leibow did not have a duty of care to warn Morris about the bonuses 
  and related-party transactions. This submission has two branches. First, Hercules 
  was a negligent misrepresentation case and should not automatically be applied 
  to a duty to warn case. Second, even if Hercules applies, it recognizes exceptional 
  cases in which an auditor's prima facie duty of care is not ousted by policy 
  considerations. Morris argues that his relationship with Taylor Leibow establishes 
  one of these exceptional cases. We do not agree with either branch of Morris's 
  submission. </p>
<p>
  [687] Hercules was a negligent misrepresentation case. It concerned the extent 
  of an auditor's duty to shareholders of a company for negligently prepared financial 
  statements. Morris's claim against Taylor Leibow is not for negligently prepared 
  audited statements of IWS, but for failure to warn him about information Taylor 
  Leibow uncovered or should have uncovered during the course of its audits. Morris 
  frames his claim as a failure to warn rather than in negligent misrepresentation 
  because the latter cause of action requires proof of actual reliance. As Morris 
  maintains that he did not read the audited financial statements of IWS, he can 
  hardly claim that he relied on them. But, however framed, the claim against 
  Taylor Leibow - like the claim against the auditors in Hercules - arises out 
  of its audit retainer with the company.</p>
<p>
  [688] More important, Hercules did no more than apply the two-stage test from 
  Anns v. Merton London Borough Council, [1978] A.C. 728, which has consistently 
  been applied by the Supreme Court of Canada to determine the scope of liability 
  for a wide array of negligence claims, especially, as this one is, claims for 
  the recovery of pure economic loss. Under the Anns test the court asks first 
  whether the parties have a sufficient relationship of proximity to establish 
  a prima facie duty of care, and second, whether policy considerations negate 
  that prima facie duty. </p>
<p>
  [689] Although negligent misrepresentation imports considerations of reasonable 
  reliance not relevant to a negligent failure to warn, for either claim the general 
  framework in Anns will determine whether a duty of care exists. The Supreme 
  Court itself applied the general framework that La Forest J. set out in Hercules 
  in subsequent duty to warn decisions, such as Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd. 
  v. Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd., [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1210. Therefore, the trial 
  judge cannot be criticized for drawing on the analysis in Hercules to decide 
  whether Taylor Leibow owed the duty of care contended for by Morris. </p>
<p>
  [690] The more important question is whether the trial judge was correct in 
  concluding that Taylor Leibow had no duty of care to warn Morris that the bonus 
  allocations and related-party transactions were detrimental to his interests. 
  We think that she was. </p>
<p>
  [691] The two-stage Anns test recognizes that policy considerations play a significant 
  role in determining whether a duty of care exists. In its latest formulation 
  of the test - in Cooper v. Hobart, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537, decided after the trial 
  judgment in the present case - the Supreme Court concluded that policy infuses 
  both stages of Anns. McLachlin C.J.C. wrote at 550-51: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In brief compass, we suggest that at this stage in the evolution of the law, 
  both in Canada and abroad, the Anns analysis is best understood as follows. 
  At the first stage of the Anns test, two questions arise: (1) was the harm that 
  occurred the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's act? and 
  (2) are there reasons, notwithstanding the proximity between the parties established 
  in the first part of this test, that tort liability should not be recognized 
  here? The proximity analysis involved at the first stage of the Anns test focuses 
  on factors arising from the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. 
  These factors include questions of policy, in the broad sense of that word. 
  If foreseeability and proximity are established at the first stage, a prima 
  facie duty of care arises. At the second stage of the Anns test, the question 
  still remains whether there are residual policy considerations outside the relationship 
  of the parties that may negative the imposition of a duty of care.</p>
<p>
  [692] At the first stage of Anns the trial judge found, at para. 2441 of her 
  reasons, a sufficient relationship of proximity to establish a prima facie duty 
  of care: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In all of the circumstances, I find that the auditors owed a prima facie duty 
  of care to Morris. The test in Anns v. Merton London Borough Council, adopted 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada in Hercules has been met here. A sufficient relationship 
  of proximity or neighbourhood exists between the auditors and Morris such that 
  carelessness on the part of the auditors would be likely to cause damage to 
  Morris. The auditors were clearly aware that Morris was a 50% shareholder of 
  IWS and a client. It was foreseeable that Morris would reasonably rely on the 
  IWS financial statements [citations omitted]. </p>
<p>
  [693] Nonetheless, at the second stage of Anns, though "troubled" 
  by the result, she concluded at paras. 2447 and 2449 that this prima facie duty 
  was ousted by policy concerns about indeterminate liability: </p>
<p class="indent"> I agree with the submissions of counsel for Taylor Leibow that, 
  absent a specific request by Morris for protection by the Auditors or by Taylor 
  or by Wiseman, any duty of care arising from the audit engagement was owed to 
  IWS.</p>
<p class="indent">There was no evidence here to the effect that in respect of 
  the audit Taylor Leibow was specifically retained to provide information to 
  Morris. While I am troubled by this aspect of the case, I find that Taylor Leibow 
  owed no duty of care in respect of the audit to Morris personally, that policy 
  considerations about indeterminate liability override the prima facie duty of 
  care. The facts here do not fall within the exceptions discussed by the Supreme 
  Court in Hercules [citations omitted].</p>
<p>
  [694] In our opinion, policy concerns at both stages of Anns negate any prima 
  facie duty of care. We accept the trial judge's findings on the "proximity" 
  between the parties. Proximity here means that Morris and Taylor Leibow had 
  a sufficiently close relationship that in doing its audit work Taylor Leibow 
  had an obligation to be mindful of Morris's legitimate interests: see Hercules, 
  at 187-88. The evidentiary record supports this finding of proximity. For example, 
  although IWS was Taylor Leibow's client, Wiseman acknowledged that the "real 
  clients" were Morris and Chester. </p>
<p>
  [695] We turn from this finding of proximity to policy considerations. In Hercules, 
  La Forest J. concluded that in doing audit work for a company, in preparing 
  reports and in reviewing a company's financial statements, auditors normally 
  owe no duty of care to individual shareholders. Auditors perform these functions 
  to permit shareholders as a group to collectively oversee the administration 
  and management of a company. Ordinarily they do not do their work to enable 
  individual shareholders to make personal business decisions. </p>
<p>
  [696] Imposing a duty on auditors to look out for the interests of individual 
  shareholders raises the concern first articulated by Cardozo C.J. in Ultramares 
  Corp. v. Touche, 174 N.E. 441 (N.Y.C.A. 1931) at 444, and often repeated since: 
  that the defendant might be exposed to "liability in an indeterminate amount 
  for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class". The Supreme Court 
  of Canada has fastened on this concern as a policy consideration limiting the 
  circumstances in which a duty of care is established. In most cases this policy 
  concern will - at the second stage of Anns - negate any prima facie duty of 
  care owed by auditors to individual shareholders of a company. The trial judge 
  relied on this "residual" policy concern to negate the prima facie 
  duty that Taylor Leibow owed to Morris. We agree with her reasoning on this 
  point. </p>
<p>
  [697] Admittedly, in Hercules La Forest J. recognized that there might be exceptional 
  cases in which the policy concern about indeterminate liability did not arise 
  and, thus, the prima facie duty of care owed by an auditor to an individual 
  shareholder would not be negated. The exceptional case requires the shareholder 
  to show two things: the auditor knows the shareholder's identity; and the shareholder 
  uses the auditor's work for the specific purpose for which it was undertaken. 
  In his reasons in Hercules, La Forest J. discussed these two requirements several 
  times. For example, he wrote at 198: </p>
<p class="indent">
  In other words, in cases where the defendant knows the identity of the plaintiff 
  (or of a class of plaintiffs) and where the defendant's statements are used 
  for the specific purpose or transaction for which they were made, policy considerations 
  surrounding indeterminate liability will not be of any concern since the scope 
  of liability can readily be circumscribed. Consequently, such considerations 
  will not override a positive finding on the first branch of the Anns/Kamloops 
  test and a duty of care may quite properly be found to exist.</p>
<p>
  [698] Like the plaintiffs in Hercules, Morris has established the first requirement 
  but not the second. And as in Hercules, Morris's failure to establish the second 
  requirement negates the prima facie duty of care. </p>
<p>
  [699] Taylor and Wiseman had known Morris for a very long time. This relationship 
  alleviates any concerns about liability to an indeterminate class. However, 
  Morris did not seek to use Taylor Leibow's work for the purpose for which it 
  was undertaken. Taylor Leibow undertook its audit work for the typical purpose 
  of an audit engagement, to permit the controlling directors and shareholders, 
  Morris and Chester, to better administer and manage the business of IWS. It 
  did not perform its audit work to allow one shareholder, Morris, to make sure 
  he was not being cheated by the other shareholder, Chester. In other words, 
  by accepting an audit engagement for IWS, Taylor Leibow did not undertake to 
  conduct its work with an eye to the personal interests of either of the two 
  shareholders. To hold otherwise would expose Taylor Leibow, unknowingly, to 
  liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time, here potentially 
  over $50 million over the course of more than a decade. </p>
<p>
  [700] Taylor Leibow would only have had a duty of care to look out for Morris's 
  personal interests, and to warn him of any actions taken by his brother that 
  were detrimental to those interests, if it had agreed to such an expansion of 
  its mandate. Yet the evidence shows that Taylor Leibow never undertook or agreed 
  to do work that it was not specifically asked to do. And the evidence shows 
  that Morris never asked Taylor Leibow to expand its mandate to protect his interests 
  or warn him about actions that might detrimentally affect his position in IWS: 
  to the contrary, Morris's total reliance on Chester was central to his position 
  in the litigation. </p>
<p>
  [701] Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary. Morris never brought any of his 
  business concerns to the auditors even after the estate freeze discussions in 
  the 1970s aroused his suspicions about the future operations and control of 
  IWS. In other words, he never retained Taylor Leibow to give him personal advice 
  about his interests in IWS. Thus, in doing its audit work for IWS, Taylor Leibow 
  had no obligation to bring the information it discovered to Morris's attention.</p>
<p>
  [702] During its audits, Taylor Leibow did become concerned about whether the 
  seemingly excessive bonuses to Chester's sons could be justified. It also learned 
  about Robert's request not to include a related-party note for Greycliffe in 
  IWS's financial statements. Wiseman spoke to Taylor about both matters, and 
  Taylor then spoke to Linton and Chester, but not to Morris. In both instances 
  Taylor Leibow's concerns were tax concerns. Therefore, Taylor went to the two 
  people responsible for tax matters: Linton and Chester. Taylor Leibow had reason 
  to be concerned about Revenue Canada; it had no reason to be concerned about 
  one brother cheating the other. </p>
<p>
  [703] Morris's submission that Taylor Leibow owed him a duty of care raises 
  a second problem, a problem that arises out of the relationship between the 
  parties and, thus, at the first stage of the Anns test. The problem is one of 
  potential conflict of interest. Suppose Morris had gone to Taylor Leibow and 
  said: "I am concerned about the way my brother is running IWS. When you 
  do the audit, let me know if you find anything suggesting that my fifty per 
  cent interest in the company is being diluted." Most likely, Taylor Leibow 
  would have replied: "To comply with your request would put us into a conflict 
  of interest with your brother and our client IWS. We cannot act." </p>
<p>
  [704] During oral argument, counsel for Morris contended that the analysis in 
  Hercules did not apply to a closely-held company such as IWS, which was more 
  akin to a partnership between the two brothers. He argued that Taylor Leibow 
  had a "whistle blower" obligation, which included telling one brother 
  that the other was trampling on his interests. We take a different view. Especially 
  in a closely-held company such as IWS, unless both "partners" agreed 
  that the auditor would take on this whistle blower role, doing so would potentially 
  put it in an untenable conflict of interest. </p>
<p>
  [705] Therefore, concerns about Morris not using Taylor Leibow's work for the 
  purpose for which it was undertaken and about a potential conflict of interest 
  negate the prima facie duty of care that Taylor Leibow may have owed to Morris 
  Waxman. Accordingly, we decline to give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  (b) Did the Trial Judge Err in Failing to Hold that Taylor Leibow Owed a Duty 
  to Morris Beyond its Role as Auditor of IWS?</p>
<p><a name="706"></a>[706] Morris contends that in assessing Taylor Leibow's obligation 
  to him, the trial judge focused too narrowly on an auditor's duty to end users 
  of audited financial statements. Morris submits that Taylor Leibow owed him 
  a duty of care not just as the auditor of IWS, but as his long-time and trusted 
  financial advisor and personal accountant. Morris says that this duty included 
  the obligation to tell him of information contrary to his personal interests. 
  Thus, if Taylor or Wiseman knew that his fifty per cent interest in IWS was 
  being eroded, either had an obligation to tell him. </p>
<p>
  [707] In support of this submission Morris points to these considerations: his 
  long-standing relationship with Taylor and Taylor Leibow, stretching back nearly 
  forty years; his "notes from the grave" in which he claimed that in 
  business matters Taylor, Wiseman, and Chester were the people he most trusted; 
  and Taylor's own acknowledgement that Morris and Chester were as close to him 
  as any non-family members could be. Perhaps most important, Morris relies on 
  Wiseman's evidence that during the discussions about an estate freeze, he felt 
  an obligation and responsibility to make sure Morris understood that Chester 
  was contemplating a 60/40 split in the ongoing ownership interests of IWS.</p>
<p>
  [708] To us, this evidence falls short of establishing that Taylor Leibow had 
  a general duty to warn Morris any time it discovered information suggesting 
  his half-interest in IWS was being diminished. By themselves, neither the length 
  of Taylor Leibow's relationship with Morris nor the closeness of that relationship 
  can create the duty of care contended for by Morris. And Morris's "notes 
  from the grave" - handwritten comments that were never communicated to 
  Taylor or Wiseman - cannot create a duty of care either.</p>
<p>
  [709] Whether a duty of care existed must depend on what Taylor Leibow was retained 
  to do, and on the reasonable expectations of the parties arising from that retainer. 
  Here, Morris's submission contradicts the undisputed evidence. Taylor Leibow 
  was retained from time to time for very specific tasks: to review the tax returns 
  of the Waxman family, including Morris, and to advise Chester and Morris during 
  the estate freeze discussions, which explains why Wiseman brought the potential 
  60/40 split in IWS to Morris's attention.</p>
<p>
  [710] Tellingly, Morris never retained Taylor Leibow to look out generally for 
  his business or personal interests. He never looked on Taylor Leibow as his 
  trusted personal or financial advisor. Indeed he never asked Taylor Leibow to 
  provide him with financial or investment advice. And the trial judge found that, 
  historically, Taylor Leibow never did anything for Morris that it was not asked 
  to do. </p>
<p>
  [711] Morris and Chester made business decisions about IWS and personal investment 
  decisions within the Waxman family. They made them separately, or together, 
  but typically without the advice of their outside auditor. Taylor Leibow was 
  not consulted about the bonus payments. It was not consulted about the share 
  sale or any of the discussions leading to it. </p>
<p>
  [712] Absent a specific request to do so, Morris could not reasonably expect 
  that Taylor Leibow would advise him of the possible erosion of his fifty per 
  cent interest in IWS. Had Taylor Leibow been asked to accept such a retainer 
  it may well have refused. For by accepting it, as we said earlier, the firm 
  risked being in the middle of a conflict between two brothers and long-standing 
  friends, who were the directors of an important corporate client. </p>
<p>
  [713] Therefore, we conclude that Taylor Leibow owed no duty of care in tort 
  to Morris personally. It owed no duty as auditor and it owed no duty based on 
  its historical relationship with Morris and Chester. Taylor Leibow was the auditor 
  for IWS and it was to the company and to the shareholders collectively that 
  it owed a duty of care.</p>
<p>
  (c) Did the Trial Judge Err in Failing to Find that Taylor Leibow Owed a Fiduciary 
  Duty to Morris?</p>
<p> <a name="714"></a>[714] Morris submits that the trial judge erred by failing 
  to find that Taylor Leibow owed him a fiduciary duty, a duty that again would 
  include advising him of information contrary to his interests. We decline to 
  give effect to this submission for two reasons: the trial judge's express finding 
  to the contrary; and the absence of the traditional hallmarks of a fiduciary 
  relationship between Morris and Taylor Leibow.</p>
<p>
  [715] The trial judge found at para. 2448 of her reasons that, "[o]n the 
  facts of this case, given the authorities cited above, I find no specific circumstances 
  sufficient to give rise to a fiduciary duty owed to Morris personally in respect 
  of the audit."</p>
<p>
  [716] A finding on the existence of a fiduciary duty is typically a question 
  of mixed fact and law: the application of the well-recognized legal characteristics 
  of a fiduciary relationship to the specific facts of any given relationship. 
  Here, Morris does not suggest that the trial judge misapplied the law. Therefore, 
  her finding that Taylor Leibow owed no fiduciary duty to Morris personally is 
  largely factual and is entitled to deference on appeal: see Hodgkinson, supra 
  at p. 425-6.</p>
<p>
  [717] Morris seeks to escape the consequences of this finding by two alternative 
  arguments. He argues that although the trial judge found that Taylor Leibow 
  owed no fiduciary duty as auditor, she did not decide whether it owed an "independent" 
  fiduciary duty. Alternatively, he argues that the trial judge's conclusion on 
  fiduciary duty really just meant that Taylor Leibow owed no duty to Morris in 
  tort. We do not agree with either argument. </p>
<p>
  [718] We acknowledge that the trial judge's finding, uncharacteristically, is 
  not as clear as it might be. It comes in a section of her reasons dealing with 
  a duty of care in tort, and is in the middle of a series of three paragraphs 
  under the heading "Taylor Leibow Owed No Duty of Care to Morris in the 
  IWS Audit" (paras. 2447-49). Moreover, the scope of the phrase "in 
  respect of the audit" is perhaps somewhat confusing. Nonetheless, we have 
  no reason not to take the trial judge's words at face value. </p>
<p>
  [719] Unquestionably, the trial judge knew the difference between a duty of 
  care in tort and a fiduciary duty. No one could seriously suggest otherwise. 
  To say that the words "in respect of the audit" limited the scope 
  of the finding to Taylor Leibow's duty as auditor would mean that the trial 
  judge failed to address Morris's claim of an independent fiduciary duty, a failure 
  that would be inconsistent with the thoroughness of her reasons. Thus, we take 
  her finding to mean that Taylor Leibow owed no independent fiduciary duty as 
  well as no fiduciary duty as auditor to advise Morris of information contrary 
  to his interests learned during its audits. Morris accepts that if this is our 
  view of the scope of the trial judge's finding then, because of appellate deference 
  to that finding, his submission must fail. </p>
<p>
  [720] However, even if we were to accept the limited scope of the finding contended 
  for by Morris, we see no basis for an independent fiduciary duty. Simply because 
  Taylor Leibow is a firm of professional accountants and gave advice to Morris 
  personally from time to time does not automatically give rise to a fiduciary 
  relationship between them: see Brant Investments Ltd. v. Keep Rite Inc., (1991) 
  80 D.L.R. (4th) 161 at 172 (Ont. C.A.); Roman Corp. v. Peat Marwick Thorne, 
  (1994) 12 B.L.R. (2d) 10 at 28 (Ont. G.D.). Nor do Morris's assertions, largely 
  self-serving, that he "trusted" and "relied on" Taylor Leibow 
  create a fiduciary duty. We must consider whether their relationship is characterized 
  by the accepted badges of a fiduciary relationship: whether Taylor Leibow had 
  scope to exercise some discretion or power; if so, whether it could exercise 
  that discretion or power unilaterally to affect Morris's legal or practical 
  interests; and whether Morris was vulnerable to the exercise of that discretion 
  or power.</p>
<p>
  [721] None of these badges was present. When Morris consulted others about his 
  own business and financial affairs, invariably he went to Chester, occasionally 
  to Linton. He gave Taylor Leibow neither discretion nor power over his business 
  affairs. Taylor Leibow learned about decisions taken by IWS, for example the 
  bonuses, after they had been made. It had no power over the business interests 
  of Morris, or indeed of IWS. Equally, Morris had no particular vulnerability 
  to Taylor Leibow. He was the president of IWS, a director of the company and 
  active in its significant operations. Taylor Leibow provided very few services 
  to Morris personally. Save for preparing his tax returns, he did not rely on 
  Taylor Leibow.</p>
<p>
  [722] Either because of the trial judge's express finding or because the hallmarks 
  of a fiduciary relationship are not present, we decline to give effect to Morris's 
  submission that Taylor Leibow owed him a fiduciary duty. </p>
<p>
  (d) Did the Trial Judge Err in Finding that Taylor Leibow Could Rely on the 
  Agreement and Undertaking in Defence of Morris's Claim on the Related-Party 
  Transactions?</p>
<p><a name="723"></a>[723] Although it is unnecessary to consider this issue because 
  of our conclusion that Taylor Leibow owed no duty to Morris personally, for 
  the sake of completeness we will address it. </p>
<p>
  [724] In July 1998, after Morris had sued Taylor Leibow on the bonuses but before 
  he had sued on the related-party transactions, Taylor Leibow gave him copies 
  of its working papers. In exchange for doing so Morris signed - with legal advice 
  - an "agreement and undertaking" in which he undertook not to sue 
  Taylor Leibow for "any alleged negligence or other deficiency with respect 
  to their accounting and auditing work". The full text of Morris's undertaking 
  provided as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  IN CONSIDERATION of the making available by Taylor Leibow of its working paper 
  files for I. Waxman &amp; Sons Limited for 1979 through 1984, Greycliffe companies 
  for 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1983 and Icarus Leasing Inc. for 1982 and 1983, the 
  undersigned hereby agree and undertake that they shall not commence any civil 
  proceeding against Taylor Leibow claiming damages on the basis of any alleged 
  negligence or other deficiency with respect to their accounting and auditing 
  work with respect to the aforesaid companies for the fiscal years indicated 
  above.</p>
<p>
  [725] The trial judge concluded that the undertaking was akin to a release and 
  she held that it barred Morris's claim against Taylor Leibow for negligently 
  failing to include a note about the related-party transactions in IWS's financial 
  statements. </p>
<p>
  [726] Morris submits that Taylor Leibow cannot rely on the agreement and undertaking 
  to bar his claim for three reasons: first, the undertaking releases only claims 
  for a negligent audit, not for a failure to warn; second, the undertaking does 
  not release Morris's claim in tort or breach of fiduciary duty against Taylor 
  Leibow based on their long-standing relationship; and third, Taylor Leibow is 
  precluded from relying on the undertaking because, before Morris signed it, 
  Wiseman gave materially false evidence on discovery. </p>
<p>
  [727] The first two reasons advanced by Morris depend on limiting the scope 
  of the undertaking to release only claims for negligently performed audits. 
  We do not agree that the undertaking is so limited. Its scope turns on how broadly 
  the phrase "with respect to their accounting and auditing work" is 
  defined. </p>
<p>
  [728] In our view, the phrase is broad enough to bar Morris's claim of a failure 
  to warn. If Taylor Leibow had a duty to warn Morris about IWS's related-party 
  transactions with Greycliffe, that duty arose from its audit work. It was during 
  its audit work that Taylor Leibow learned of, or should have learned of, the 
  diversion of profits from IWS to Greycliffe. Thus, we think that the undertaking 
  Morris signed released Taylor Leibow from all future claims arising from its 
  audit work, whether the claim was for negligent misrepresentation or for a failure 
  to warn, and whether it was based on Taylor Leibow's duty as auditor or on an 
  independent duty derived from its long-standing association with Morris. </p>
<p>
  [729] Morris's final attack on the undertaking rests on his assertion that Wiseman 
  lied on discovery. Had Wiseman told the truth, Morris says he would have sued 
  Taylor Leibow for failing to warn him about the related-party transactions before 
  releasing any claims. We find Morris's position unpersuasive.</p>
<p>
  [730] Wiseman was examined for discovery in 1997. During his examination he 
  testified that when he conducted the 1981 and 1982 audits of IWS he was unaware 
  of any material related-party transactions. Later, at trial, Wiseman testified 
  that at the time of the 1981 and 1982 audits he was aware of the substantial 
  related-party transactions with Greycliffe. The trial judge accepted Wiseman's 
  evidence at trial.</p>
<p>
  [731] When Wiseman gave his discovery evidence about the related-party transactions 
  he qualified his answers by saying that he had not reviewed Taylor Leibow's 
  working papers before being discovered. Indeed, almost twenty years had passed 
  since he had last seen them. Wiseman later clarified his discovery evidence 
  in a letter from his counsel dated November 16, 1998. Morris did not complain 
  about this clarification. If Wiseman's original discovery evidence was inaccurate, 
  it was not deliberately so. Indeed the trial judge did not find that Wiseman 
  lied on his discovery. </p>
<p>
  [732] Moreover, Wiseman's answers did not preclude Morris from suing Taylor 
  Leibow on the related-party transactions. Before signing the undertaking Morris 
  knew the following: he knew IWS's transactions with Greycliffe were not noted 
  on IWS's financial statements; he knew Taylor Leibow had audited the statements; 
  he had, and therefore must be taken to have known, the contents of Linton's 
  working papers. And he had sued in the main action for alleged profit diversions. 
  He could have expanded that allegation to include a claim against Taylor Leibow 
  but chose not to do so. </p>
<p>
  [733] For all these reasons we are satisfied that the trial judge was correct 
  in her conclusion that Morris's undertaking barred his tort claim against Taylor 
  Leibow for failing to warn him of IWS's related-party transactions with Greycliffe.</p>
<p>
  iv. Conclusion on Morris's Appeal</p>
<p> <a name="734"></a>[734] We conclude that the trial judge was correct in holding 
  that Taylor Leibow owed neither a duty of care in tort nor a fiduciary duty 
  to Morris. We also conclude that she was correct in holding that the agreement 
  and undertaking that Morris signed barred his claim against Taylor Leibow on 
  the related-party transactions with Greycliffe. For these reasons, we dismiss 
  Morris's appeal against Taylor Leibow. </p>
<p>
  v. Taylor Leibow's Cross Appeal</p>
<p> <a name="735"></a>[735] Taylor Leibow cross-appealed against the trial judge's 
  findings of negligence. However, counsel for Taylor Leibow did not press us 
  to consider the cross-appeal if we dismissed Morris's appeal. As we have done 
  so, apart from what we have already said, we think it unnecessary to further 
  consider the cross-appeal.</p>
<p>
  G. Linton's Appeal</p>
<p> <a name="736"></a>[736] Wayne Linton has appealed the judgment against him 
  in the Taylor Leibow action. The trial judge found him liable for knowingly 
  assisting Chester in his dishonest breaches of fiduciary duty toward Morris. 
  In some parts of her reasons she also appears to have found Linton liable on 
  the basis of oppression. We need not consider whether in law Linton could be 
  liable under s. 248 of the OBCA, because we have determined that she properly 
  found him liable for knowing assistance, and liability under s. 248 would add 
  nothing to her remedy</p>
<p>
  [737] In concluding that he was liable for knowing assistance, the trial judge 
  underlined a number of the findings of fact involving Linton that she made in 
  the main action. She found that he was aware of all the reasons that made Morris 
  vulnerable to Chester's breaches of trust, including Morris's poor health in 
  late 1983, and his complete trust in Chester in the conduct of the financial 
  affairs of IWS.</p>
<p>
  [738] The trial judge then went on to highlight various actions of Linton throughout 
  the 1980s that demonstrate how faithfully he followed Chester's directions in 
  complete disregard of Morris's best interests. She provided a lengthy list of 
  these actions at para. 2565 of her reasons.</p>
<p>
  [739] The trial judge concluded that Linton was actively involved in helping 
  Chester to effect the 1979, 1981, and 1982 bonuses and to structure and implement 
  the share sale. She found that he did so knowing that these transactions were 
  dishonest breaches of fiduciary duty by Chester. </p>
<p>
  [740] Turning to the profit diversions to Robert's companies, the trial judge 
  found that Linton was aware of the nature and extent of those related-party 
  transactions, but did not reflect them in his drafts of the IWS financial statements 
  between 1980 and 1982. Indeed, he relayed to the auditors Robert's desire that 
  there be no such disclosure. In general, she found that Linton did Chester's 
  bidding in allowing Robert to improperly divert unreasonable profits to his 
  companies. The trial judge concluded that by doing these things, Linton participated 
  in Chester's dishonest breach of fiduciary duty to Morris.</p>
<p>
  [741] She ordered that Linton pay damages to Morris in the same amounts as ordered 
  against Chester for the consequences of the share sale during the period of 
  constructive trust; for the 1979, 1981 and 1982 bonuses; and for the profit 
  diversions before the share sale. She found IWS vicariously responsible for 
  Linton's conduct and therefore held it liable in like measure. However, because 
  in most instances Linton acted at Chester's behest and did not personally benefit, 
  she did not assess punitive damages against him.</p>
<p>
  [742] In this court, counsel argued that Linton cannot be liable in knowing 
  assistance in relation to the bonuses or the consequences of the share sale 
  because no trust monies were involved. However, as we have explained earlier, 
  this doctrine applies equally where the knowing assistance is of a dishonest 
  breach of fiduciary duty. The findings of the trial judge make graphically clear 
  that this was such a case, both concerning the bonuses for 1979, 1981 and 1982 
  and concerning the share sale.</p>
<p>
  [743] Counsel also argues that the trial judge found Linton liable for the bonuses 
  based on "collusion and knowing assistance of oppression", neither 
  of which are pleaded nor viable in law. Although both phrases appear in her 
  reasons, we think a fair reading is that neither served as a basis for liability. 
  Rather, liability is squarely and expressly founded on Linton's knowing assistance 
  of Chester's breaches of fiduciary duty. The trial judge's findings of fact 
  amply sustain this conclusion.</p>
<p>
  [744] Counsel's final argument in relation to Linton's liability for the bonuses 
  and the share sale challenges the trial judge's findings of fact. In dealing 
  with the appeal in the main action we have addressed the broad and detailed 
  factual picture painted by the trial judge of the sorry history of IWS from 
  1979 to the time of trial and her detailed description of the roles of the various 
  players in it. We have found no reason to interfere with her factual findings. 
  </p>
<p>
  [745] Counsel also says that the trial judge erred in finding Linton liable 
  for the profit diversions based only on Linton's conveyance to the auditors 
  of Robert's wish that the 1982 IWS financial statement not disclose related-party 
  transactions. He argues that the real fault is that of the auditors, who made 
  the final decision not to disclose, and since Morris did not read the statements, 
  Linton's acts had no adverse effect in argument. </p>
<p>
  [746] We do not read the reasons of the trial judge that way. We see her conclusion 
  concerning Linton's role in the profit diversions to be based on her finding 
  that he was actively involved in this particular dishonest breach of fiduciary 
  duty by Chester. Although not expressly stated in her reasons, the trial judge's 
  findings throughout concerning Chester, Morris and Linton make this conclusion 
  inevitable. </p>
<p>
  [747] We therefore dismiss Linton's appeal from the finding of liability against 
  him. However, just as we did in the main action (and for the same reasons) we 
  vary the judgment against Linton to provide for half the amount of profit diversions 
  ordered by the trial judge. Otherwise Linton's appeal is dismissed. </p>
<p>
  VII</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION</p>
<p> <a name="748"></a>[748] As indicated at the outset, we agree with the trial 
  judge's disposition except in minor ways. For convenience we repeat these minor 
  variations here. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Robert, Warren and Gary are liable for only one half of the 1981 and 1982 
    bonuses that they received: see para. 556.</li>
  <li>Chester, IWS and Robert and his companies are liable for only one half of 
    the amounts ordered by the trial judge in relation to the Greycliffe profit 
    diversions: see para. 567.</li>
  <li>The order for damages in relation to the Ancaster property is set aside: 
    see para. 570. </li>
  <li>Robert, Warren and Gary are liable for only one half of the post sale profits 
    that they received: see para. 587.</li>
  <li>Ennis is liable for all losses flowing to Morris from having been deprived 
    of a fifty per cent interest in IWS and from the lease, only to the end of 
    January 1985: see para. 670.</li>
  <li>Linton is liable for only one half of the amounts ordered in relation to 
    the Greycliffe profit diversions: see para. 747.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  [749] Despite these minor variations, overall we have found the trial judge's 
  reasons thorough, lucid and fully reasoned. Our repeating reading of them in 
  the course of preparing our own reasons have amply enhanced this view. The trial 
  reasons represent a significant achievement at the end of a long and complex 
  proceeding. </p>
<p>
  [750] The parties have not yet addressed the issue of costs. We invite counsel 
  to do so by written submissions. Before filing those submissions, counsel are 
  to meet with Goudge J.A., who will determine the appropriate procedure. </p>
<p>
  [751] The appeals are dismissed save in the limited respects we have indicated.</p>
<p>
  [752] As we leave this case two impressions linger: the tragedy of a family 
  shattered and the service accorded to the administration of justice by counsel 
  and a trial judge who, in difficult circumstances, performed their roles in 
  exemplary fashion.</p>
