<p>On appeal from order of the Superior Court of Justice (Divisional Court) (Regional 
  Senior Justice Robert Blair, Justice Dennis G. Lane and Justice Gloria Epstein) 
  dated June 26, 2002.</p>
<p>
  BY THE COURT: </p>
<p>
  [1] The action underlying this appeal involves former employees of Kmart Canada 
  ("Kmart") whose employment was terminated when several Kmart stores 
  were closed as a result of the Hudson's Bay Company acquiring Kmart's shares. 
  The claimants allege that they were wrongfully dismissed. Brockenshire J. certified 
  the action and, subsequently, the respondents agreed that class members who 
  were not dismissed for cause were entitled to reasonable notice or pay in lieu 
  thereof. There are approximately 4,000 members in the class across Canada, excluding 
  British Columbia and Quebec. </p>
<p>
  [2] The motion judge also established a procedure for determining individual 
  issues, predominantly the issue of what notice period any individual employee 
  was entitled to and whether or not the respondent provided this notice period 
  to the employee. The motion judge ordered that in Ontario the class members' 
  claims would be determined by way of individual "references". At the 
  request of counsel for the representative plaintiff and the class members, retired 
  judges of ADR Chambers were appointed to conduct these references. That process 
  proved to be expensive in relation to the size of the claims and the amount 
  of the awards. Counsel for the representative plaintiff and the class members 
  then brought a motion to change many aspects of the reference procedure and 
  it is the order made on that motion that is the subject of this appeal. </p>
<p>
  [3] The relevant part of the motion judge's order is as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">
  1. This Court orders that where a class member residing in Ontario has a claim 
  for $25,000 or less, exclusive of interest and costs, a Deputy Judge of the 
  Ontario Small Claims Court shall be appointed as the Referee to hear the claim 
  as follows</p>
<p class="center"> &#133;</p>
<p class="indent"> 2. This Court orders that where a class member residing in 
  Ontario has a claim for more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and costs, 
  a Judge, Master, or Case Management Master of the Ontario Superior Court of 
  Justice may be appointed as the Referee to hear the claim as follows.</p>
<p>
  [4] For both types of claims, the class member is to provide the trial co-ordinator 
  for the appropriate court with specified documents, including a copy of the 
  order and a "Request for Appointment of Referee". Further, the trial 
  co-ordinator is directed to endeavour to obtain the consent of the deputy judge, 
  judge, master, or case management master of the Superior Court named in the 
  draft order and to provide it to the local registrar who, unless a problem arises 
  which requires the involvement of the motion judge, is to issue the order appointing 
  the referee. The motion judge assumed that the deputy judges of the Small Claims 
  Court would receive their ordinary remuneration from the government. </p>
<p>
  [5] The respondent sought and obtained leave to appeal asking that the Divisional 
  Court set aside the two paragraphs of the motion judge's order referred to in 
  para. 3 above. The Divisional Court allowed the appeal. In its reasons, the 
  Divisional Court concluded that the appointment of deputy judges of the Small 
  Claims Court constituted an improper exercise of the power reserved to the Chief 
  Justice of the Superior Court under s. 14(1) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. C.43. The Divisional Court also struck the order appointing Superior 
  Court judges, masters and case management masters for claims over $25,000 for 
  the same reason. The Divisional Court remitted to the motion judge the matter 
  of the appointment of persons to conduct references.</p>
<p>
  [6] The issue on this appeal is whether the Divisional Court erred when it held 
  that the motion judge exercised the power reserved to the Chief Justice under 
  s. 14(1) of the Courts of Justice Act when he appointed judicial officers to 
  conduct references under s. 25(1)(b) of the Class Proceedings Act, 1992, S.O. 
  1992, c.6 .</p>
<p>
  [7] Section 14(1) of the Courts of Justice Act provides: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Justice shall direct 
  and supervise the sittings of the Superior Court of Justice and the assignment 
  of its judicial duties.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> </p>
<p>
  [8] The appellant's first submission is that the respondent failed to raise 
  the s. 14(1) issue at first instance and ought not to be allowed to raise it 
  now.</p>
<p>
  [9] We do not accept that submission To begin, the respondent did not ask that 
  the motion judge appoint deputy Small Claims Court judges as referees. The motion 
  judge did it on his own initiative. In any event, on the appeal to the Divisional 
  Court, the respondent did raise the s. 14(1) issue in its factum. </p>
<p>
  [10] Next, the appellant submits that the order of the motion judge appointed 
  the deputy judges of the Small Claims Court as referees in their individual 
  capacities and not in their capacities as judges and, as such, s. 14(1) has 
  no application. We do not agree. The terms of the order refer to those judges 
  as judges. Moreover, the order contemplates the use of court staff in an administrative 
  capacity in the conduct of references and the motion judge, in his reasons, 
  assumed that the deputy judges of the Small Claims Court would be paid by the 
  government. Clearly, the motion judge intended that the deputy Small Claims 
  Court judges conduct the references in their judicial capacity.</p>
<p>
  [11] The appellant then submits that the order does not violate s. 14(1) for 
  two reasons. First, although the Class Proceedings Act was enacted relatively 
  recently, the appointment of referees by judges without the intervention of 
  the Chief Justice is a longstanding element of our judicial system. For example, 
  rule 54.03(1) authorizes a reference to a judge, with that judge's consent, 
  to a registrar or "other officer of the court", or to a person agreed 
  on by the parties. </p>
<p>
  [12] We do not think that the fact that references may be ordered in other contexts 
  without case-by-case compliance with s. 14(1) of the Courts of Justice Act answers 
  the concern about compliance with that section for appointments under the Class 
  Proceedings Act. Appointments under rule 54.03 have been an accepted part of 
  the judicial landscape in Ontario for generations and the use of judicial resources 
  for that purpose is done either with the express or implied approval of the 
  Chief Justice. The same cannot be said of appointments of referees under s. 
  25(1)(b) of the Class Proceedings Act.</p>
<p>
  [13] The Class Proceedings Act was first enacted in 1992. Section 25(1)(b) creates 
  a process for establishing references under the Act. Given the very nature of 
  class proceedings, the potential number of references that might be ordered 
  under s. 25(1)(b) is enormous. Significantly, the Legislature has not limited 
  the scope of those who may be appointed to conduct references to judges or other 
  judicial officers. Instead, the Legislature has specified that the court may 
  appoint "one or more persons".</p>
<p>
  [14] Clearly, the "persons" referred to s. 25(1)(b) may include judges 
  or judicial officers and, subject to what we say below, it would be open to 
  a court acting under s. 25(1)(b) to appoint such a person. However, given that 
  such an appointment falls outside the responsibilities that have historically 
  been exercised by judges or other judicial officers, and given the potentially 
  enormous impact of such appointments upon the deployment of judicial resources, 
  we are of the view that a court should not appoint a judge or judicial officer 
  to conduct a reference under s. 25(1)(b) of the Class Proceedings Act without 
  first complying with the requirements of s. 14(1) of the Courts of Justice Act 
  by obtaining authorization of the Chief Justice or her designate.</p>
<p>
  [15] The appellant's second argument is that the requirement in the motion judge's 
  order that the appointees consent to serve as referees amounts to compliance 
  with the requirements of s. 14(1). We do not agree. Section 14(1) confers on 
  the Chief Justice the responsibility of directing and supervising the sittings 
  of Superior Courts in assigning judicial duties. The consent of individual judicial 
  officers to their own appointment is not an adequate substitute for the role 
  played by the Chief Justice under s. 14(1). </p>
<p>
  [16] The functional realities of the administration of justice require that 
  the Chief Justice or her designate, not individual judges, have the overarching 
  responsibility and control of judicial assignments. To hold otherwise could 
  seriously impair the ability of the Chief Justice to coordinate and prioritize 
  the allocation of already scarce resources. Absent a direction from the Chief 
  Justice, the consent of individual judicial officers to serve in the manner 
  specified in the order does not satisfy the requirements of s. 14(1).</p>
<p>
  [17] There is no evidence in this record that the Chief Justice assigned the 
  judges, or other judicial officers named in the motion judge's order, to conduct 
  the references contemplated by that order. Accordingly, we are satisfied that 
  the Divisional Court was correct in striking the two impugned paragraphs from 
  the order and remitting the matter of appointments of referees to the motion 
  judge.</p>
<p>
  [18] We are sympathetic to the efforts of the motion judge to bring about an 
  expeditious resolution of these claims. If the motion judge had appointed Small 
  Claims Court judges as individuals in their private capacity to be paid in accordance 
  with the direction of the referee rather than by the government, and without 
  the involvement of the court's administrative staff, we do not think that s. 
  14(1) of the Courts of Justice Act would have been contravened. Indeed, we hope 
  that counsel will be able to agree upon an approach to appointing referees that 
  will result in the individual claims being dealt with in an expeditious and 
  cost-effective manner.</p>
<p> [19] Neither the motion judge nor the Divisional Court awarded costs. We award 
  costs of this appeal to the respondent and fix those costs in the amount of 
  $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T., provided that such costs are 
  not payable until the proceedings underlying this appeal are finally disposed 
  of.</p>
