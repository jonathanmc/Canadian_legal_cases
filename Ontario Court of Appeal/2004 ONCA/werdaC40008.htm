<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p class="boldcenter">Released Orally: June 18, 2004</p>
<p>[1] The appellant is a paralegal and private investigator. He was charged with 
  the offence of attempting to obstruct justice contrary to s. 139(2) of the Criminal 
  Code. The charge arose out of his dealings with a complainant in a domestic 
  assault case in which he had been retained by the accused. The accused had been 
  released on an undertaking which prohibited him from contacting the complainant 
  either directly or indirectly. In spite of this order, the appellant, after 
  he was retained by the accused, tracked down the complainant and went to her 
  residence to take a statement. The appellant was aware of the non?communication 
  order that bound his client.</p>
<p>[2] The appellant was tried before Justice J. Robert MacKinnon, sitting with 
  a jury. He was found guilty and received a one year conditional sentence. The 
  appellant appeals his conviction on three grounds. We note that defence counsel 
  at trial made no objection with respect to any of these grounds.</p>
<p>[3] First, the appellant contends that the trial judge failed to give a Vetrovec 
  warning with respect to the testimony of the complainant.</p>
<p>[4] We disagree. The complainant had a single criminal conviction for impaired 
  driving, which hardly relates to her credibility. Moreover, defence counsel 
  at trial did not seek a Vetrovec warning. In R. v. Glasgow (1996), 110 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 59 at 60 (Ont. C.A.) Doherty J.A. said:</p>
<p class="indent">It is well established that a trial judge has a discretion as 
  to whether to give a "Vetrovec" warning. An appellate court must show 
  deference when reviewing the exercise of that discretion. If a trial judge was 
  not asked to give the warning, it is difficult to understand how the trial judge 
  can be said to have erred in the exercise of his or her discretion.</p>
<p>For these reasons, we see no merit in the first ground of appeal.</p>
<p>[5] The appellant contends that the trial judge failed to properly instruct 
  the jury with respect to the theory of the defence as it related to the complainant's 
  motive to fabricate, and failed to outline the evidence supporting the theory.</p>
<p>[6] We disagree. In the context of a relatively short and uncomplicated trial, 
  the trial judge's summary of the defence evidence and theory was both full and 
  accurate. In particular, the trial judge instructed the jury that if the complainant's 
  statement to the appellant was false that act would constitute an attempt to 
  obstruct justice by her. He also instructed that the appellant denied threatening 
  the complainant in any way or telling her not to go to court, and put the defence 
  position that the appellant's evidence should, at the very least, raise a reasonable 
  doubt as to the essential elements of the offence.</p>
<p>[7] The appellant's third submission is that the trial judge's charge to the 
  jury with respect to the actus reus of the offence was vague, imprecise and 
  incorrect.</p>
<p>[8] We disagree. In our view, the trial judge's identification of the aspects 
  of the appellant's conduct that could serve as the actus reus of the offence 
  was entirely accurate.</p>
<p>[9] The appeal is dismissed.</p>
