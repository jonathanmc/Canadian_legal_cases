<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Ronald G. Thomas of the Superior 
  Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on May 5, 1998.</p>
<p>
  MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>
  A. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>
  [1] Sonia Run was viciously beaten and strangled to death in her home. The appellant, 
  Ernest Westergard, was convicted of first degree murder at the conclusion of 
  a long trial presided over by Justice Ronald G. Thomas.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant appeals on several grounds relating to the availability of 
  a verdict of first degree murder, and the trial judge's instructions to the 
  jury concerning the appellant's statements to the police, after-the-fact conduct 
  evidence and identification evidence.</p>
<p>
  [3] At the conclusion of the hearing, the panel indicated that the appeal was 
  dismissed, with reasons to follow. These are the reasons.</p>
<p>
  B. FACTS</p>
<p>
  [4] Sonia Run was killed in her home on September 26, 1994. Her naked and badly 
  beaten body was found on the upstairs bathroom floor. Jonathan Newman, a qualified 
  expert in blood stain analysis, testified that Ms. Run had been killed in the 
  master bedroom and then moved to the bathroom, where she had been washed. The 
  box spring in the master bedroom was exposed during the assault. Given the transference 
  of blood from the box spring to the mattress, it was likely that the mattress 
  was placed back on the box spring immediately after the murder, while the blood 
  was still wet.</p>
<p>
  [5] Dr. John Deck was qualified as an expert in the area of forensic pathology. 
  He testified that Ms. Run suffered significant trauma to her head, caused by 
  blows of "considerable force". There were also extensive injuries 
  to the front of her neck. There was a "branching kind of split" in 
  her anus. She suffered numerous defensive wounds, including to her hands and 
  forearms. The cause of death was strangulation associated with blunt force injury 
  to the head.</p>
<p>
  [6] The appellant was employed at the Benchmark Carpet store in Mississauga, 
  which was about a five minute drive from the Run home. He had been at the Run 
  home several times in the two months before the murder, taking measurements 
  for carpets and attending when they were installed.</p>
<p>
  [7] On September 26, 1994, the appellant left Benchmark Carpet at about 9:30 
  a.m. Shortly after 11:00 a.m., he called a La Cache store in Oakville where 
  he had a morning appointment and reported that he was lost. After receiving 
  directions, he arrived at the La Cache store between 11:15 and 11:20 a.m.</p>
<p>
  [8] Upon leaving the La Cache store, the appellant went to the Oakville Mall 
  where he paid a bill and bought a tie between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p>
  [9] The Crown's theory was that the appellant drove to the Run home and sexually 
  assaulted and killed Ms. Run between 9:45 and 11:00 a.m. The two key components 
  of the Crown case were forensic evidence linking the appellant to the crime 
  scene and evidence relating to his use, within hours of the murder, of make-up 
  to hide facial injuries he had received.</p>
<p>
  [10] The forensic evidence against the appellant was formidable. In particular, 
  the appellant's DNA profile was found under the fingernails on both of the victim's 
  hands. Pamela Newall, the head of the Biology Section of the Centre for Forensic 
  Sciences in Toronto, testified about the relationship between the appellant's 
  DNA sample (which he had provided to the police) and the DNA found under the 
  victim's fingernails: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Now dealing then with your conclusions with respect to [the] 
  item that was submitted to the Centre as item C39, the right hand fingernail 
  scrapings from the body of Sonia Run, what are your conclusions?</p>
<p class="indent">A. The dominant DNA profile from the right hand fingernail scrapings, 
  C39, from Sonia Run matches the DNA profile from Ernest Westergard at 17 polymorphic 
  PCR loci and comes from a male.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And are you able to tell us what is the frequency of occurrence 
  of that dominant matching profile which matches Ernest Westergard?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Based upon data from the Causcasian population of Ontario, 
  the frequency with which this DNA PCR 17 locus profile of Mr. Westergard would 
  be expected to occur is less than one in the population of the world.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And what is the approximate population of the world?</p>
<p class="indent">A. The approximate population of the world is six billion.</p>
<p>[11] Other forensic evidence linking the appellant to the crime 
  scene, and Ms. Newall's expert testimony concerning it, were a hair found under 
  the mattress ("one in 60,000"), a blood stain on the water faucet in the bathroom 
  ("one in 14 million"), and a semen stain with a blood component found on the 
  box spring in the bedroom ("a partial match at three loci to Ernest Westergard").</p>
<p>
  [12] The Crown also led evidence that when the appellant attended the Oakville 
  Mall on September 26 (which he admitted), he went to the Caryl Baker Visage 
  store and purchased make-up supplies and had store staff apply make-up to his 
  face. In addition, numerous witnesses testified that in the days following September 
  26, the appellant had fairly obvious facial injuries and wore considerable make-up 
  to hide them.</p>
<p>
  [13] The Crown called 80 witnesses during the six week trial. The appellant 
  did not testify; indeed the defence called no evidence. The appellant made two 
  statements to the police in the two weeks after the murder. These statements 
  were introduced at the request of the Crown. The Crown relied on them as potential 
  evidence of a concocted alibi or consciousness of guilt. The appellant relied 
  on them as evidence of a partial alibi and to raise a doubt based on his limited 
  opportunity to commit the crime.</p>
<p>
  [14] The jury deliberated for nine hours. They asked one question about the 
  difference between first and second degree murder. They returned a verdict of 
  first degree murder.</p>
<p>
  C. ISSUES</p>
<p>
  [15] The issues on appeal are: </p>
<p class="indent"> (1) Did the trial judge err by failing to instruct the jury 
  that s. 231(5) of the Criminal Code did not apply if the sexual assault took 
  place after the murder?</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Did the trial judge err in his treatment of the appellant's 
  statements to the police?</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Did the trial judge err in failing to give an appropriate 
  limiting instruction in relation to the after-the-fact conduct evidence?</p>
<p class="indent">(4) Did the trial judge err in his instruction in relation to 
  the identification evidence of the staff at the Caryl Baker Visage strore?</p>
<p>
  D. ANALYSIS</p>
<p>
  (1) First degree murder</p>
<p>
  [16] The appellant was charged with first degree murder pursuant to s. 231(5) 
  of the Criminal Code: </p>
<p class="indent"> 231(5) &#133; murder is first degree murder in respect of a 
  person when the death is caused by that person while committing &#133; an offence 
  under one of the following sections: &#133;</p>
<p class="indent">(b) section 271 (sexual assault) &#133;.</p>
<p>
  [17] The trial judge charged the jury in accordance with the 'single transaction' 
  principle. He stated that if the jury was satisfied that the appellant was guilty 
  of murder, they then had to consider if he caused the murder "while committing 
  or attempting to commit a sexual assault". He continued: </p>
<p class="indent">
  While committing or attempting to commit, does not require that the sexual assault 
  and the murder occur simultaneously. It is sufficient if the murder and the 
  sexual assault are connected and form part of the same transaction. In other 
  words, it is sufficient if the act causing the death and the acts constituting 
  the assault are all part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single 
  transaction.</p>
<p>
  [18] Dr. John Deck was the only witness who testified about the temporal relationship 
  between the sexual assault on, and the time of death of, Ms. Run: </p>
<p class="indent"> Q. Sir, is this injury that you have described to Mrs. Run's 
  anus, is that consistent with an attempted act of anal intercourse or an actual 
  act of anal intercourse?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And you say that could have happened before death or after 
  death?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Yes.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And are you able to say &#133;.</p>
<p class="indent">A. I can't make the distinction.</p>
<p class="indent">Q. And are you able to say, either before or after death, how 
  recent to death this injury was caused?</p>
<p class="indent">A. Well it's fresh. I mean, it's not any significant time before 
  death. It's fresh like all the other injuries so I can say it didn't occur some 
  time before, but as I say, I can't say whether it was around the time of death 
  but before death had actually occurred, or after death. If tissues are torn 
  after death, there may be a little bit of blood appears at the site. Blood vessels 
  throughout the body still have blood in them and if they're torn, there may 
  be some blood present. Now there's minimal blood here, externally, and none 
  internally. So the possibility that this occurred after the heart had stopped 
  beating is something I cannot exclude. It may well have done - been at that 
  time.</p>
<p>
  [19] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in two respects in his 
  charge to the jury on first degree murder: (1) he did not instruct the jury 
  that if the sexual assault occurred post-mortem, the appellant could not be 
  found guilty of first degree murder; and (2) he failed to relate the evidence 
  to the law by not telling the jury that the testimony of Dr. Deck could raise 
  a doubt about first degree murder because it left open the question of the sequence 
  of the sexual assault and the murder.</p>
<p>
  [20] The 'single transaction' principle for the interpretation of s. 231(5) 
  of the Code was first enunciated by Martin J.A. in R. v. Stevens (1984), 11 
  C.C.C. (3d) 518 at 541 (Ont. C.A.): </p>
<p class="indent"> Thus, it appears clear that where death is caused after the 
  underlying offence is complete and the act causing death is committed for the 
  purpose of facilitating the flight of the offender, the murder is not ss. 213 
  and 214(5)(b) [now s. 231(1) and (5)] murder.</p>
<p class="indent">I do not wish, however, to be taken as holding that where the 
  act causing death and the acts constituting the rape, attempted rape, indecent 
  assault or an attempt to commit indecent assault, as the case may be, all form 
  part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction, that 
  death would not be caused during the commission of the offence, even though 
  the underlying offence in s. 213 in a sense could be said to be then complete. 
  [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>
  [21] Justice Martin's interpretation of s. 231(5) of the Code was approved by 
  the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Par&eacute; (1987), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 97. 
  In that case, the accused indecently assaulted a seven year old boy. He then 
  got dressed. At that point the boy told the accused that he intended to tell 
  his mother about the incident. The accused said that he would kill him if he 
  told his mother. The accused made the boy lie on his back. He waited for about 
  two minutes with his hand on the boy's chest. He then strangled and beat the 
  boy to death.</p>
<p>
  [22] The accused admitted these facts at his trial and was convicted of first 
  degree murder. The Quebec Court of Appeal reversed. However, the Supreme Court 
  of Canada allowed the appeal and restored the conviction for first degree murder. 
  Justice Wilson specifically adopted the passage from Stevens set out above and 
  continued, at p. 108: </p>
<p class="indent"> The offences listed in s. 214(5) are all offences involving 
  the unlawful domination of people by other people. Thus an organizing principle 
  for s. 214(5) can be found. This principle is that where a murder is committed 
  by someone already abusing his power by illegally dominating another, the murder 
  should be treated as an exceptionally serious crime. Parliament has chosen to 
  treat these murders as murders in the first degree.</p>
<p class="indent">Refining then on the concept of the "single transaction" referred 
  to by Martin J.A. in Stevens, supra, it is the continuing illegal domination 
  of the victim which gives continuity to the sequence of events culminating in 
  the murder. The murder represents an exploitation of the position of power created 
  by the underlying crime and makes the entire course of conduct a "single transaction". 
  This approach, in my view, best gives effect to the philosophy underlying s. 
  214(5).</p>
<p>
  [23] Stevens and Par&eacute; are cases where the aggravating offence listed 
  in s. 231(5) was committed first and the murder followed. In the present case, 
  the appellant contends that Dr. Deck's evidence gives rise to the possibility 
  of a reverse sequence - Ms. Run was murdered and then the perpetrator engaged 
  in sexual activity with her dead body. This subsequent conduct would not amount 
  to the aggravating offence of sexual assault because a dead body cannot be assaulted.</p>
<p>
  [24] In support of this submission, the appellant relies on R. v. Quesnel (1991), 
  4 C.R. (4th) 118 (Man. C.A.). In Quesnel, the accused gave a statement to the 
  police in which he admitted breaking into a woman's apartment, choking her and 
  stabbing her several times with a knife. He then inserted a pen in her vagina 
  and masturbated on a towel beside her. The Manitoba Court of Appeal set aside 
  the conviction for first degree murder and substituted a verdict of second degree 
  murder. Justice Twaddle reasoned, at p. 123: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Depending upon the jury's view of the sequence of events it is possible, even 
  likely, in the present case that the acts which caused the death precede the 
  sexual assault. If that was so, it cannot be said that there was an illegal 
  domination of the victim prior to the acts which caused her death. There being 
  no underlying sexual assault, the murder cannot be said to be the culminating 
  act of domination. The single transaction concept in reverse does not, in my 
  opinion, bring the murder within the ambit of s. 231(5) as a "death caused 
  by a person while committing" a sexual assault. In consequence, a properly 
  instructed jury might reasonably acquit the accused of first degree murder.</p>
<p>
  [25] The appellant relies heavily on Quesnel and contends that it was incumbent 
  on the trial judge to instruct the jury that if they had a reasonable doubt 
  about the sequence of events inside the Run home - in particular, whether the 
  sexual act or acts were performed on the victim after she was dead - they could 
  not find the appellant guilty of first degree murder.</p>
<p>
  [26] For several reasons, I do not agree with the appellant's submissions on 
  this issue.</p>
<p>
  [27] First, in the pre-charge conference the trial judge explicitly raised the 
  issue of the interpretation of s. 231(5) of the Code. He informed counsel of 
  his proposed charge on this issue and obtained their concurrence with it: </p>
<p class="indent"> The Court: The Crown has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
  that the accused committed or attempted to commit a sexual assault against Sonia 
  Run. It is the underlying offence which turns murder into first degree. If the 
  jury are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed or attempted 
  to commit a sexual assault. As I understand the law, while committing, which 
  is found in s. 231(5), does not require that the underlying offence, meaning 
  sexual assault, and the murder occur simultaneously. It is sufficient if the 
  murder and the sexual assault are connected and form part of the same transaction. 
  That is the way I propose to put it to the jury. I don't think anybody can object 
  to that. If you do, now is the time.</p>
<p class="indent">[Defence Counsel]: No, we're fine.</p>
<p>
  [28] It is understandable that trial counsel regarded the proposed charge as 
  "fine". The defence position did not turn on seconds or minutes or 
  on the specific sequence of events. Rather, the defence position was to challenge 
  whether there was a sexual assault at all. As expressed by defence counsel near 
  the end of her closing address to the jury: </p>
<p class="indent">
  Are you able to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that during the course of 
  this attack Sonia Run was either sexually assaulted or an attempt was made to 
  sexually assault her? And when you think about that issue, bear in mind, as 
  you must, there is nothing about the examination of the vaginal area, or the 
  internal examination of the anus, or the swabs that were tested by Jonathan 
  Newman to support such a position. Don't, members of the jury, stretch the science 
  more than it is capable of.</p>
<p>
  [29] Second, unlike Par&eacute; and Quesnel, there is no air of reality to the 
  appellant's position on this issue. In both of those cases, there was direct 
  evidence from the accused about the sequence of events. Here, in his statements 
  to the police, the appellant denied any knowledge of, or participation in, the 
  crime. He did not testify.</p>
<p>
  [30] Moreover, there was ample evidence of a sexual assault. Ms. Run was killed 
  in her bedroom. There was semen, without sperm (the appellant had earlier had 
  a vasectomy), on the box spring in the bedroom. The semen was mixed with the 
  victim's blood. Ms. Run was found nude. She had an anal split. She was viciously 
  beaten and strangled. Without evidence to contradict these facts, the conclusion 
  that the sexual assault and the murder were part of a single transaction is 
  inescapable. There simply is no air of reality to the theory that after being 
  murdered, Ms. Run's body was sexually violated in a separate transaction unrelated 
  to her murder.</p>
<p>
  [31] Third, with respect, I do not agree with the decision in Quesnel. In my 
  view, it is inconsistent with Par&eacute; and with several recent appellate 
  decisions, including one from the Manitoba Court of Appeal, which I prefer.</p>
<p>
  [32] Put succinctly, Quesnel articulates a view of s. 231(5) that is both too 
  narrow and too artificial. In Par&eacute;, Wilson J. cautioned against an overly 
  refined or technical approach to s. 214(5) (now s. 231(5)) of the Code. In that 
  case, defence counsel contended that the words "while committing" 
  in that provision meant that the aggravating offence (indecent assault) and 
  the murder had to be committed simultaneously. Justice Wilson rejected this 
  argument and adopted the 'single transaction' approach from Stevens. She said, 
  at p. 107: </p>
<p class="indent">
  A second difficulty with the exactly simultaneous approach is that it leads 
  to distinctions that are arbitrary and irrational. In the present case, had 
  the respondent strangled his victim two minutes earlier than he did, his guilt 
  of first degree murder would be beyond dispute. The exactly simultaneous approach 
  would have us conclude that the two minutes he spent contemplating his next 
  move had the effect of reducing his offence to one of second degree murder. 
  This would be a strange result. The crime is no less serious in the latter case 
  than in the former; indeed, if anything, the latter crime is more serious since 
  it involves some element of deliberation. An interpretation of s. 214(5) that 
  runs contrary to common sense is not to be adopted if a reasonable alternative 
  is available.</p>
<p>
  [33] In R. v. Richer (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 394 (Alta. C.A.), Fraser 
  C.J.A. made observations quite similar to Wilson J.'s comments in Par&eacute;: </p>
<p class="indent"> Were it necessary to determine whether sexual activity with 
  a murder victim following the moment of death could ever constitute first degree 
  murder, I would be inclined to the view taken by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal 
  in R. v. Ganton (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 259, 32 W.A.C. 126, 105 Sask. R. 126. 
  Wakeling J.A. concluded that a murder in these circumstances could fall within 
  the parameters of s. 231(5)(b) providing the Crown had established the necessary 
  linkage between the two acts. I tend to share his view. That is because I have 
  difficulty with the proposition that a murderer intent on silencing his victim 
  or rendering her compliant for sexual activity should be able to argue that 
  murder in these circumstances is not first degree murder simply because his 
  victim died by his hand before he could complete, or for that matter, begin 
  the sexual assault.</p>
<p class="indent">This entire debate on whether the precise moment of the victim's 
  death preceded or followed the precise moment of sexual assault is highly artificial. 
  This "chicken and egg" approach to which came first, the murder or the sexual 
  assault, obscures the essence of the rationale for Parliament's decision to 
  classify a murder committed during a sexual assault as first degree. That rationale 
  does not involve punishing a person for committing two separate crimes in a 
  specific order - first sexual assault, then murder - but rather punishing a 
  person because he has committed both in circumstances in which a temporal and 
  causal connection exists between the two. What is important is not the order 
  of commission but the linkage between the two crimes. When the required linkage 
  is found to exist, it is the two crimes - sexual assault and murder - committed 
  together, regardless of the order, which represent the ultimate exploitation 
  of the position of power over a victim and arguably mandate a conviction for 
  first degree murder.</p>
<p>
  [34] I agree with Fraser C.J.A.'s analysis. I am also attracted to the comment 
  of Steel J.A. in R. v. Muchikekwanape (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 144 at 172-73 
  (Man. C.A.) - "The continuous transaction concept adopted by the Supreme 
  Court in Par&eacute; &#133; prevents the law from being brought into disrepute 
  by requiring a debate of the precise second of the victim's death."</p>
<p>
  [35] For these reasons, I conclude that the trial judge did not err by failing 
  to instruct the jury that s. 231(5) of the Code did not apply if the sexual 
  assault took place after the murder. His instruction on first degree murder 
  was sound and in full compliance with the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada 
  in Par&eacute;.</p>
<p>
  (2) The appellant's statements to the police</p>
<p>
  [36] The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in two respects in his 
  treatment of the appellant's two statements to the police, which were introduced 
  as evidence: (1) he failed to instruct the jury in accordance with R. v. W.(D.) 
  (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.); and (2) he failed to adequately instruct 
  the jury about when they could use the appellant's statements as positive evidence 
  of guilt.</p>
<p>
  [37] I disagree. The giving of a W.(D.) instruction is within the discretion 
  of the trial judge. The appellant did not testify. The defence called no evidence. 
  Defence counsel did not request a W.(D.) instruction with respect to the appellant's 
  statements, nor object to the trial judge's charge on reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>
  [38] In W.(D.), Cory J. said that the failure to give a W.(D.) instruction is 
  not fatal. The fundamental question is whether "the charge, when read as 
  a whole, makes it clear that the jury could not have been under any misapprehension 
  as to the correct burden and standard of proof to apply" (p. 409).</p>
<p>
  [39] The trial judge gave careful and accurate instructions about the presumption 
  of innocence and the burden of proof. The jury was well-equipped to perform 
  its duties.</p>
<p>
  [40] Nor do I think that the trial judge erred in his instruction concerning 
  the use the jury could make of the appellant's statements. The trial judge told 
  the jury that they could believe all, some or none of the statements. He continued: </p>
<p class="indent"> It is critical that you appreciate that such remark or utterance 
  may be evidence for or against its maker, the accused. Accordingly, should there 
  be anything in the remark, utterance or statement which you feel in any way 
  assists the accused, you must give it your careful attention. Similar care ought 
  to be given to those portions which you find to tell against the accused. They 
  are not to be viewed in isolation, but rather assessed in light of the circumstances 
  under which the words were spoken and in light of the evidence adduced in this 
  case.</p>
<p class="indent">It will be for you, as with any items of evidence, to determine 
  what weight ought to be assigned to them. In so determining the weight, you 
  are entitled to consider of course, the accused's emotional condition and state 
  of mind at the time of making of such remarks and/or utterances as are attributed 
  to him. You will want to examine all of the circumstances in determining what 
  weight to attach to his remarks, utterances or statements attributed to the 
  accused person.</p>
<p>
  I regard this as a succinct, balanced and sensible instruction.</p>
<p>
  (3) After-the-fact conduct evidence</p>
<p>
  [41] The appellant contends that the trial judge gave an insufficient limiting 
  instruction in relation to the after-the-fact conduct evidence relied on by 
  the Crown - the application of make-up to hide facial injuries, the disposal 
  of items in garbage receptacles on two occasions, and the alteration of an invoice 
  at the store where the appellant worked.</p>
<p>
  [42] I disagree. The trial judge gave a limiting instruction in this area. Importantly, 
  his charge reflected almost entirely the position defence counsel took on this 
  issue during the pre-charge conference. The appellant cannot now object to the 
  charge that he sought.</p>
<p>
  [43] In any event, the trial judge's charge on after-the-fact conduct evidence 
  was appropriate. He specifically instructed the jury that "if there is 
  some innocent explanation for the conduct, you can use the evidence to infer 
  guilt only after you have rejected the innocent explanation." He then carefully 
  reviewed the explanations advanced by the defence to explain the appellant's 
  conduct.</p>
<p>
  (4) Identification evidence</p>
<p>
  [44] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct 
  the jury to disregard the evidence of the aestheticians who testified that they 
  applied make-up to the appellant on the day of the murder. I disagree. The aestheticians' 
  evidence was far removed from a 'non-identification' scenario.</p>
<p>
  [45] The appellant also contends that the trial judge's instruction about the 
  frailties of identification evidence was insufficient. I disagree. The trial 
  judge's instruction in this domain was comprehensive and in full compliance 
  with the leading authorities.</p>
<p>
  E. DISPOSITION</p>
<p>
  [46] I do not want to leave this appeal without making a final observation. 
  Having read a considerable portion of the transcript of this long trial, I was 
  struck by the exemplary performance of the trial judge throughout the trial. 
  His treatment of the jury, counsel and witnesses was consistently informative 
  and courteous. He presided with firmness, but without ever being abrupt or contentious. 
  He genuinely sought the assistance of counsel and was alive to the difficult 
  role of counsel in a murder case. The end result of the trial judge's skill 
  and conduct was the desired result - a palpably fair trial.</p>
<p>
  [47] I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
