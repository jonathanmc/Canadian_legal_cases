<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] At the outset of the appeal, the appellant abandoned the grounds relating 
  to the admissibility of his statement. The narrow remaining issue on this appeal 
  is whether the trial judge, in response to the jury's final question, erred 
  in failing to repeat to them his earlier re-instruction on the question of the 
  intent required under s. 229(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code, namely, that it must 
  be subjective. </p>
<p>
  [2] Both counsel agree, in response to the defence counsel's objection to the 
  original charge, that the trial judge committed no error in his recharge. The 
  recharge made it abundantly clear that the intent required was subjective, not 
  objective. So, too, did the trial judge's response (at p. 734) to the first 
  question posed by the jury. </p>
<p>
  [3] We note, as well, in the context of his brief charge as a whole, that the 
  trial judge made it known on no less than fourteen occasions that it was the 
  subjective intent of the appellant that had to be the focus of their deliberations. 
  In our view, the final question from the jury reflected a concern on its part 
  as to whether the inference that a sane and sober person intends the natural 
  consequences of his actions is permissive or presumptive. The trial judge's 
  response in repeating what he had originally told the jury made it clear that 
  it is an inference that is permissive rather than presumptive.</p>
<p>
  [4] In all of the circumstances, while it would not have been improper for the 
  trial judge to repeat what he had said on the recharge about the subjective/objective 
  dichotomy, we are not persuaded that his failure to do so constituted reversible 
  error. Reading the record as a whole, we are satisfied that the jury would have 
  understood that in order to convict the appellant of murder, they had to be 
  satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the requisite subjective 
  intent.</p>
<p>
  [5] As for the other grounds, we are satisfied that the trial judge's review 
  of the defence evidence was adequate in the circumstances. </p>
<p>
  [6] We are further of the view that a W.(D.) instruction was not mandatory in 
  this case: see R. v. Westergard, [2004] O.J. No. 1500. This is so, particularly 
  given the trial judge's instructions at (p. 667) to the effect, on the crucial 
  issue of intent, that since the evidence was circumstantial, the jury could 
  only convict if they were satisfied &quot;that the only rational and logical 
  conclusion is that the accused is guilty.&quot; While that instruction was not 
  necessary on the issue of intent, it inured to the benefit of the appellant 
  and leaves us without concern as to the jury's proper understanding of the principles 
  that give rise to the need for a W.(D.) instruction.</p>
<p>
  [7] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
