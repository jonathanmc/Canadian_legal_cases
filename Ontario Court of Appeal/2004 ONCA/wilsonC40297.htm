<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The crown appeals the sentence on two grounds: (1) the trial judge's comments 
  to the Crown during the sentence hearing displayed a lack of impartiality which 
  constituted, or at least bordered on, bias; and (2) a conditional sentence for 
  this offence and this offender was an unfit sentence.</p>
<p>
  [2] Several of the trial judge's comments to the Crown during the sentence hearing 
  were inappropriate. Crown counsel tried to make an entirely proper submission 
  about sentence. The trial judge almost made this impossible with repeated ill-conceived 
  remarks about the cases being relied on by the Crown. Civility in the courtroom 
  must always be vigilantly guarded.</p>
<p>
  [3] Moreover, the trial judge's substantive comments about the Crown's cases 
  were misplaced - many of the cases were in fact relevant to some of the factors 
  that the trial judge needed to consider in imposing sentence. Put succinctly, 
  the trial judge should have listened to the Crown's submissions, not launched 
  into several entirely inappropriate harangues. </p>
<p>
  [4] Having said that, the interventions do not indicate that the trial judge 
  prejudged the matter of sentence. He conveyed to counsel, as he was entitled 
  to do, his view that a conditional sentence was a sentence that needed to be 
  addressed.</p>
<p>
  [5] The Crown also argues that a conditional sentence is inappropriate in this 
  case given that: (1) the respondent fled the scene and did not seek assistance 
  for the victim, or contact the authorities for several hours; (2) the respondent 
  consumed a significant amount of alcohol; and (3) the respondent had been warned 
  in the past not to drive after drinking. In those circumstances, the Crown asserts 
  that a conditional sentence is not in the interests of justice. It does not 
  challenge the twelve-month term of the conditional sentence imposed by the trial 
  judge.</p>
<p>
  [6] The respondent has filed fresh evidence on this appeal, without objection 
  from the Crown, that establishes that the respondent has complied with the terms 
  and conditions of her conditional sentence, she has not had a drink since the 
  date of this incident, and she has taken all rehabilitation courses recommended 
  to her. More significantly, she has now completed almost ten months of the twelve-month 
  conditional sentence imposed by the trial judge.</p>
<p>
  [7] There is no doubt that this case had unfortunate and tragic consequences 
  and that the offence is most serious. However, in our view, a one-year conditional 
  sentence, with the punitive terms imposed by the trial judge, was within the 
  appropriate range having regard to the circumstances of this offence and this 
  offender. In addition, having regard to the fresh evidence filed with this court, 
  it would not be in the interests of justice to incarcerate the respondent at 
  this time. Had a custodial sentence been imposed from the outset, as the Crown 
  argues should have been the case, the respondent would already be on some form 
  of release. </p>
<p>
  [8] Accordingly, to incarcerate the respondent now would not serve either the 
  public interest or the interests of the respondent.</p>
<p>
  [9] For the reasons given, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the sentence 
  appeal is dismissed. </p>
