<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant was charged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of 
  trafficking and trafficking in cocaine. Both charges arose out of the same incident. 
  The appellant was acquitted of the possession charge but convicted of the trafficking 
  charge. </p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant appeals his conviction on two grounds: </p>
<p class="indent"> 1. The trial judge erred in charging the jury on party liability; 
  and</p>
<p class="indent">2. The Crown unfairly cross-examined him. </p>
<p>
  First ground</p>
<p>
  [3] In answer to a question from the jury suggesting the appellant might have 
  been a middleman, and at the suggestion of his counsel, the trial judge charged 
  the jury on party liability under s. 21 of the Criminal Code. We agree with 
  the appellant that whether he was a middleman was irrelevant and the jury should 
  have been so told. The Crown's case was based on the appellant having made an 
  offer, regardless of his role. </p>
<p>
  [4] Even accepting, however, that the instruction on s. 21 amounted to an error 
  of law, it occasioned no substantial wrong. To convict, the jury still had to 
  find the appellant made an offer to sell. And the jury was properly told three 
  times that to convict the appellant of trafficking it had to find the appellant 
  had made an offer. We have to assume that in convicting the appellant, the jury 
  found that the Crown had proved the appellant's offer beyond a reasonable doubt. 
  </p>
<p>
  Second Ground</p>
<p> [5] The appellant submits that the Crown unfairly cross-examined him in two 
  ways: first, by asking several times whether he thought the police were lying; 
  and, second, by suggesting that he had breached his bail conditions, thus introducing 
  bad character evidence although the appellant did not put his character in issue. 
</p>
<p>
  [6] The questions directed to whether the police lied must be viewed in context. 
  The defence's theory was that the police fabricated their evidence. In this 
  context, the questions, though unnecessary, were not prejudicial. </p>
<p> [7] On the cross-examination of the appellant's breach of bail we consider 
  that the questions were proper. Whether the appellant was being truthful about 
  where he lived and whether he complied with a court order were relevant to his 
  credibility. Defence counsel did not object to these questions. Moreover, the 
  trial judge gave an appropriate limiting instruction. </p>
<p>
  [8] For these reasons the conviction appeal is dismissed. </p>
