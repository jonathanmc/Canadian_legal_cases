<p>On appeal from a disposition of the Ontario Review Board dated October 7, 2003.</p>
<p>SHARPE J.A.: </p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant appeals the Ontario Review Board's decision to refuse him 
  an absolute discharge on the ground that he continues to pose a significant 
  threat to public safety. In my view, the appeal should be allowed and an absolute 
  discharge granted.</p>
<p>
  [2] The appellant has a long history of mental illness. In 1981, at the age 
  of 26, he was charged with attempt murder and other related offences. He was 
  found not guilty by reason of insanity, and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, 
  alcohol abuse, and underlying personality disorder. Over the past twenty-three 
  years, he has made steady progress. He was detained at Oak Ridge for over four 
  years. He then was detained at Lakehead Psychiatric Hospital until 1999, when 
  he was moved into the community. In September 2001, the Board granted him a 
  conditional discharge. His psychiatric illness had been in remission since 1989 
  and he accepts the continuing need for biweekly injections of anti-psychotic 
  medication. He no longer suffers from a personality disorder. The appellant's 
  problems with alcohol were major obstacles to his reintegration into the community. 
  While the potential risk posed by alcohol consumption remains an issue, the 
  appellant has controlled his drinking in recent years.</p>
<p> [3] The Board's central findings were the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The accused has only recently been free of problems, so far as the evidence 
    indicates, as to the use of alcohol and as to criminal activity;</li>
  <li>He does not apparently have a residence as yet to which he can go;</li>
  <li>Without the Board's Order, in all likelihood, he would revert to the use 
    of alcohol with the consequence of criminal behaviour;</li>
  <li>He continues to have evidence of personality disorder with antisocial traits; 
  </li>
  <li>A further sustained period of stability is required before the accused can 
    be considered to have effected changes in his behaviour and insight which 
    are likely to continue once the Board Order is removed. The Board continues 
    to have concerns about the ongoing potential for impulsive anti-social and 
    potentially criminal behaviour; </li>
  <li>A further year under a conditional discharge would assist Mr. Wood in finding 
    accommodation which would be satisfactory for him and would allow him another 
    year in which to exhibit good conduct, while under the Board's Order. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  [4] The Board's decision is entitled to deference in this court and will only 
  be interfered with if it is found to be unreasonable. In R. v. Owen, [2003] 
  1 S.C.R. 779 at paragraph 46, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the standard 
  of reasonableness, discussed in Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) 
  v. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748, applies to appeals pursuant to s. 672.72 
  from dispositions of the Board: </p>
<p class="indent">
  [A] court reviewing a conclusion on the reasonableness standard must look to 
  see whether any reasons support it. The defect, if there is one, could presumably 
  be in the evidentiary foundation itself or in the logical process by which conclusions 
  are sought to be drawn from it. An example of the former kind of defect would 
  be an assumption that had no basis in the evidence, or that was contrary to 
  the overwhelming weight of the evidence. An example of the latter kind of defect 
  would be a contradiction in the premises or an invalid inference.</p>
<p>
  [5] In my view, the Board's finding that the appellant poses a significant threat 
  to the safety of the public is, on the record, unreasonable. On several crucial 
  points, the Board's findings are contrary to the evidence and on other points 
  they are unsupported by evidence. </p>
<p>
  (i) Alcohol abuse</p>
<p>
  [6] The Board found that the appellant has only recently been free from alcohol 
  related criminal activity and "that without the Board's Order, in all likelihood, 
  he would revert to the use of alcohol with the consequence of criminal behaviour". 
  At best, this finding is unsupported by the evidence; at worst, it is contrary 
  to the evidence. The appellant was convicted of sexual assault and assault in 
  1999 and received a sentence of five months imprisonment, but there has been 
  no repetition of any criminal activity since that time. Indeed, there has been 
  only one incident - when his breath smelled of alcohol in 2001 - to indicate 
  that he had even consumed alcohol. The evidence was that even with progressively 
  lessened restrictions on his liberty and infrequent monitoring, the appellant 
  had control over his drinking problem. The report of his treating physician 
  stated that while there was some potential for alcohol abuse, and while the 
  continuing jurisdiction of the Board provided external motivation, it "seems 
  speculative however, and not supported by the available evidence to suggest 
  that he would return to uncontrolled drinking if granted an Absolute Discharge." 
  </p>
<p>
  (ii) Place of residence</p>
<p>
  [7] The Board found that the appellant did not have a residence to which he 
  could go. The evidence was that he lived with his brother and that he was welcome 
  to continue living there. The appellant enjoys the full support of his siblings. 
  There was no evidence of any threat to public safety arising from the appellant's 
  current living arrangements. Moreover, under the Board's proposed disposition, 
  he would continue his current living arrangements in any event.</p>
<p>
  (iii) Mental health</p>
<p>
  [8] The evidence does not support the Board's finding that the appellant "continues 
  to have evidence of personality disorder with antisocial traits." There 
  was nothing to contradict the opinion of the appellant's treatment team that 
  "there are no current indications that Mr. Wood's personality characteristics 
  indicate a significant risk of aggressive behaviour in the future" or the 
  evidence of Dr. Sheppard that the diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder 
  no longer applies. </p>
<p>
  (iv) Significant threat to the safety of the public</p>
<p>
  [9] Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 
  625 at paragraph 49, holds that restrictions can only be imposed if the evidence 
  demonstrates that the not criminally responsible ("NCR") accused actually 
  constitutes a significant threat to public safety. Such a threat is not to be 
  presumed and there is no onus on the NCR accused to demonstrate that he or she 
  is not a significant threat: see paragraph 57.</p>
<p>
  [T]he threat posed must be more than speculative in nature; it must be supported 
  by the evidence. The threat must also be "significant", both in the 
  sense that there must be a real risk of physical or psychological harm occurring 
  to individuals in the community and in the sense that this potential harm must 
  be serious. A minuscule risk of grave harm will not suffice. Similarly, a high 
  risk of trivial harm will not meet the threshold. Finally, the conduct or activity 
  creating the harm must be criminal in nature [citations omitted].</p>
<p>
  [10] The appellant's treatment team stated that he is not a significant threat 
  to the public and recommended an absolute discharge. There was no evidence to 
  contradict this opinion. The overall effect of the Board's reasons is to cast 
  upon the appellant the burden of proving that he no longer poses a significant 
  threat to public safety contrary to Winko. While there is no doubt that the 
  Board is entitled to take into account the NCR accused's past in assessing the 
  risk he or she poses to the public, there must be a factual basis to support 
  a finding of significant threat. The appellant has been living in the community 
  on increasingly lenient conditions without incident for several years. His treatment 
  team gave evidence that he was cooperative and that he recognized and accepted 
  his continuing need for medication and to avoid alcohol. The Board's fears were 
  speculative in nature and unsupported by the evidence. </p>
<p> [11] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the Board's order 
  and in its place grant the appellant an absolute discharge.</p>
