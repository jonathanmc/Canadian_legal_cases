<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>CATZMAN and LASKIN JJ.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The appeal to this court is from the order of Gans J., not the reasons 
  of Gans J. On its face, the order, which dissolves two earlier orders made by 
  Nordheimer J., is interlocutory. Counsel for the responding parties submits 
  that, on the principle in Ball v. Donais (1993), 13 OR (3d) 322, Gans J.'s determination 
  in his reasons that the plaintiffs did not have standing is a final determination 
  appealable as of right to this court. We do not agree. </p>
<p>[2] In our assessment, Gans J. did not intend to, and did not, finally dispose 
  of the issue of standing. Had he intended to so, he would have dismissed the 
  action instead of making the order he did. In this connection, we note that 
  the moving parties had made a second motion before Gans J., based on Rule 21, 
  that has not yet been decided by him. We are buttressed in the view that we 
  take by the undertaking, given in this court by counsel for the moving parties 
  on behalf of their clients, that they will not take the position in future proceedings 
  in this action that the order of Gans J. is res judicata or gives rise to an 
  issue estoppel. </p>
<p>[3] We would grant the motions and quash the appeal. With respect to motion 
  M30755, costs are fixed in the sum of $5,000, plus G.S.T. With respect to motion 
  M30710, costs are fixed in the sum of $7,500, plus G.S.T. </p>
<p>Signed: &quot;M.A. Catzman J.A.&quot;<br>
  &quot;John Laskin J.A.&quot; </p>
<p>BORINS J.A. (dissenting):</p>
<p>[4] It is necessary for the court to look at the order under appeal and the 
  effect of the order in determining whether it is a final or interlocutory order 
  for purposes of appeal. Approached from this perspective, in my view, the order 
  of Gans J. is final.</p>
<p>[5] This order finally resolved a substantive issue between the parties, i.e., 
  the plaintiffs' entitlement to an interlocutory injunction given by s. 101 of 
  the Courts of Justice Act. The effect of Gans J.'s order is to preclude the 
  plaintiffs from again seeking injunctive relief until the trial of this action. 
  Thus, the order finally disposes of the plaintiffs' claim for interlocutory 
  injunctive relief and thereby deprives the plaintiffs of a substantive right 
  under s. 101. </p>
<p>[6] The order, therefore, is final and I would dismiss the motions to quash 
  the appeal.</p>
<p>Signed: &quot;S. Borins J.A.&quot;</p>
