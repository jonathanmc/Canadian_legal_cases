<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Francine E. Van Melle of the 
  Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury, on October 18, 2002.</p>
<p>
  CHARRON J.A.:</p>
<p>
  [1] The appellant appeals her conviction for importing 2.2 kilograms of cocaine. 
  The only live issue at trial was whether she knew that the cocaine was concealed 
  in the lid of her suitcase when she returned to Canada from a trip to Jamaica. 
  The trial judge was convinced that she did, and consequently convicted her. 
  The appellant, through counsel, rightly concedes that the trial judge's ultimate 
  finding on the issue of knowledge was open to her on the evidence. However, 
  the appellant submits that the trial judge, in her appreciation of the evidence, 
  made two errors that necessitate a new trial. I will deal with each in turn. 
  </p>
<p>
  [2] First, the appellant challenges the trial judge's finding that "[a] 
  person lifting the lid [of the suitcase] to close it, would have noticed that 
  the lid was heavier than it had been before and that there was something in 
  the lid." The appellant contends that this inference was contrary to the 
  evidence. In support of this contention, the appellant relies on the evidence 
  of the customs officer who first examined the suitcase. The customs officer 
  testified that she noticed an inconsistency in the lid when she viewed the x-ray 
  image of the suitcase. It would appear from her evidence that she first emptied 
  the suitcase of its contents and then carried it to the x-ray machine. The witness 
  was never asked if she noticed anything different about the suitcase prior to 
  viewing the x-ray. Nonetheless, the appellant argues that one can infer from 
  the custom officer's testimony that, but for the x-ray, no inconsistency was 
  noticeable. The appellant therefore argues that the custom officer's failure 
  to notice the heavy weight of the lid supports the appellant's assertion that 
  she "didn't suspect anything" when she packed the lid of her suitcase 
  just prior to her departure from Jamaica. </p>
<p>
  [3] The appellant submits that the customs officer's testimony should be contrasted 
  with that of the investigating officer. The investigating officer, who examined 
  the suitcase after it had been emptied of its contents, concluded that the lid 
  was heavy. The appellant argues that the customs officer's testimony should 
  have been afforded greater weight because she had more experience in cases of 
  importation than the investigating officer. Also, she had contact with the suitcase 
  when it was in the same state as when the appellant had it, that is, when it 
  was fully packed.</p>
<p>
  [4] We do not know whether this argument was made at trial because the submissions 
  of counsel were not transcribed. If the argument was not made, the trial judge 
  can hardly be faulted for failing to address it in her reasons. In any event, 
  even if the argument was made, it was within the trial judge's purview to reject 
  it and to accept the investigating officer's testimony on this point. Further, 
  we do not accept the appellant's contention that the trial judge's finding regarding 
  the weight of the lid was contrary to the evidence. In addition to the testimony 
  of the investigating officer about its heavy weight, the actual exhibits were 
  filed and were available for examination. The appellant was asked in cross-examination 
  to lift the lid of the suitcase with the 2.2 kilograms of cocaine in it. While 
  she conceded that it was "pretty heavy", she maintained that she did 
  not suspect anything. Finally, it is apparent from the record that the trial 
  judge herself examined the exhibits. She expressly reserved her decision to 
  consider the evidence and "take a look at the exhibits." </p>
<p>
  [5] In all the circumstances, we see no reason to interfere with the trial judge's 
  finding on this issue. </p>
<p>
  [6] Second, the appellant contends that the trial judge, in reaching her decision, 
  failed to consider cogent circumstantial evidence that supported the defence 
  position. The appellant states that this error is apparent from the trial judge's 
  statement that "[t]he only evidence against knowledge is Ms. Zeynabo's 
  testimony" [emphasis added]. The appellant argues that, in addition to 
  her testimony, other items of circumstantial evidence supported her position 
  that she did not know of the narcotics, including: that the reason for her trip 
  to Jamaica was her mother-in-law's funeral, a fact that was evidenced by the 
  production of a death certificate at her trial; that nothing about her behaviour 
  upon her arrival at the airport in Toronto was suspicious; and that she did 
  not take any steps to conceal the fact that the suitcase was hers when she collected 
  it at Pearson airport.</p>
<p>
  [7] Again, on this ground, it is our view that it was entirely within the trial 
  judge's domain to draw any reasonable inferences that were open to her on the 
  evidence. The trial judge concluded that there was "strong circumstantial 
  evidence of knowledge." Counsel fairly concedes that there was evidence 
  to support this conclusion. It is not our function to retry this case. We would 
  not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
<p>
  [8] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
