<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] On May 13, 2002, Wright J. stayed the appellant's action against the respondents 
  because the appellant failed to pay a series of costs awards relating primarily 
  to other proceedings. He then dismissed the action, finding that it was frivolous 
  and vexatious. The appellant moved under rules 37.14(1)(a), 37.14(1)(b) and 
  59.06 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, for an order setting 
  aside the order of Wright J. On June 12, 2003, O'Connell J. refused the appellant's 
  request that he be permitted to examine Mr. Barniske, a court administrator, 
  as a witness on the motion and also dismissed the appellant's motion. This is 
  an appeal from the order of O'Connell J. In addition, the appellant requests 
  leave to introduce fresh evidence on appeal.</p>
<p>[2] In our view, the appellant has not met the test for filing fresh evidence 
  on appeal. The evidence that the appellant seeks to introduce relates primarily 
  to his submission that he is impecunious and to circumstances that post-date 
  the order of O'Connell J. Aside from the issue of the costs of the motion before 
  O'Connell J., the question of whether the appellant is impecunious is not relevant 
  to the matters that were in issue on the motion, namely the specific tests under 
  rules 37.14(1)(a), 37.14(1)(b) and 59.06. The proposed evidence therefore is 
  not relevant to, nor potentially decisive of, any issue on this appeal. The 
  appellant's request to introduce fresh evidence is accordingly dismissed.</p>
<p>[3] We see no merit in the appellant's submissions concerning his appeal of 
  O'Connell J.'s order. The motion judge gave thorough reasons and concluded, 
  correctly, that he was not entitled, on a motion to set aside a final order, 
  to consider issues properly dealt with by way of appeal, such as alleged errors 
  in law, or bias, on the part of Wright J. Moreover, as we read his reasons, 
  the motion judge accepted the appellant's statement of Mr. Barniske's proposed 
  evidence. The motion judge did not therefore err in refusing to permit the appellant 
  to examine Mr. Barniske as a witness. </p>
<p>[4] As for the appellant's submission that the motion judge erred in finding 
  that he had not met the requirements of any of the rules permitting a final 
  order to be set aside, we note that the motion dealt with by Wright J. had been 
  pending since January 2000. The appellant was aware that Wright J. had set a 
  hearing date for the motion and, in fact, had confirmed that he was available 
  on the date that was set. In these circumstances, we agree with O'Connell J.'s 
  reasons and his conclusions that rule 37.14(1)(a) was not applicable; that the 
  appellant failed to attend the motion before Wright J. &quot;because he decided 
  not to do so for his own reasons&quot; and not because of mistake, accident 
  or insufficient notice; and that the appellant had not established fraud, or 
  facts arising or discovered after the motion, capable of justifying an order 
  to set aside the order of Wright J. </p>
<p>[5] The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs fixed at $10,000 inclusive 
  of disbursements and applicable G.S.T. In accordance with the directions of 
  the list judge, the appellant's motion for an order extending the time to appeal 
  the order of Wright J. is adjourned to no fixed date returnable on three days 
  notice before a single judge of this court sitting in chambers.</p>
