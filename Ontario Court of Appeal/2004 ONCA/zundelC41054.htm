<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT</p>
<p>[1] The appellant appeals from the judgment of Senior Justice Benotto staying 
  proceedings on his application for a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum with 
  certiorari in aid. At the conclusion of oral argument we indicated to the parties 
  that the appeal was dismissed with reasons to follow.</p>
<p>[2] The appellant, a permanent resident of Canada, is presently the subject 
  of a hearing before Blais J. of the Federal Court of Canada reviewing a certificate 
  issued under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, declaring 
  him to be inadmissible on grounds of security. The appellant was arrested on 
  May 1, 2003 after he was deported to Canada from the United States. He has remained 
  in custody since that time. Blais J. has also conducted a review of the appellant's 
  detention. On January 21, 2004, he found that the appellant's detention should 
  be continued because the appellant is a danger to national security. The hearing 
  to determine whether the certificate is reasonable is still on going.</p>
<p>[3] If Blais J. should uphold the security certificate, the appellant is subject 
  to removal from Canada. There is no appeal from that decision. It appears that 
  the appellant will be deported to Germany where he faces prosecution.</p>
<p>[4] The appellant claims that the provisions of the Immigration and Refugee 
  Protection Act that govern the procedure at the certificate review hearing and 
  the detention review hearing are unconstitutional. He also claims that Blais 
  J. was in violation of the statute because of the delay in completing the detention 
  review.</p>
<p>[5] It was conceded before the application judge that the Superior Court of 
  Justice and the Federal Court of Canada have concurrent jurisdiction to deal 
  with the constitutional issues. Only the Superior Court of Justice can deal 
  with the habeas corpus application. The application judge found that the respondent 
  had shown that the available review process in the Federal Court is not inappropriate 
  or less advantageous than the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the Superior Court 
  of Justice and in view of the expertise and experience in immigration and security 
  matters in the Federal Court, that court was the appropriate forum.</p>
<p>[6] The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act contains a comprehensive scheme 
  to review the validity of security certificates. The Associate Chief Justice 
  or a designated judge of the Federal Court is given sole jurisdiction to deal 
  with all matters concerning the reasonableness of the certificate. This includes 
  jurisdiction over confidential or sensitive information. The process mandated 
  by statute involves issues of immigration and national security for which the 
  Federal Court has particular expertise.</p>
<p>[7] As this court held in Re Peiroo and Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1989), 69 O.R. (2d) 253 at 257 [leave to appeal to S.C.C. dismissed, 62 D.L.R. 
  (4th) viii)], &quot;habeas corpus is an extraordinary remedy and, generally 
  speaking, does not lie where there is an alternative remedy available&quot;. 
  In the absence of a showing that the available alternative process established 
  by Parliament is inappropriate or less advantageous than the habeas corpus jurisdiction, 
  the Superior Court should decline jurisdiction. It seems to us that this is 
  particularly the case where the process in the Federal Court is on-going and 
  there is a risk of conflicting results.</p>
<p>[8] The appellant puts his argument for the Superior Court of Justice assuming 
  jurisdiction on the basis that there is no court that can provide him a remedy 
  within a reasonable time to vindicate his constitutional claims. He submits 
  that established jurisprudence in the Federal Court of Canada establishes that 
  the designated judge has no jurisdiction to consider his constitutional arguments, 
  a position also taken by the respondent in this court and before the Federal 
  Court. He also submits that the alternative procedure of an action in the Federal 
  Court could take up to five years to complete and during that time he would 
  remain in custody, possibly in solitary confinement, as he is at this time.</p>
<p>[9] With respect to the jurisdiction of the designated judge, that issue is 
  presently an open one. While the case law under the former Act established that 
  the designated judge has no jurisdiction to consider constitutional issues, 
  recently in Re Charkaoui, 2003 F.C. 1419, N&ouml;el J. held that under the present 
  Act, the designated judge does have jurisdiction. </p>
<p>[10] In this case, the appellant filed a Notice of Constitutional Question 
  with the Federal Court in May 2003, but he subsequently withdrew that Notice. 
  He has never brought a motion before Blais J. to attempt to raise the constitutional 
  issues. In our view, the comments made by Blais J. during the hearing do not 
  establish that he would refuse to entertain such a motion, should it be brought.</p>
<p>[11] More importantly, in our view, it has not been shown that an action in 
  the Federal Court would be less advantageous. The appellant has provided statistics 
  to show the average time taken for an action to be heard in the Federal Court. 
  However, he has not shown that those statistics have any relevance to his case. 
  He has not brought an action in the Federal Court and has not shown that the 
  Federal Court would not expedite his case given the fact that he remains in 
  custody in solitary confinement.</p>
<p>[12] In Reza v. Canada, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 394 at 403 the Court approved of a 
  portion of the reasons of Abella J.A. which was summarized as follows:</p>
<p class="indent">In her view there was no obligation on the part of the Ontario 
  Court (General Division) to hear every case presented for adjudication in which 
  there is a constitutional issue raised. She held that the discretion to decline 
  to hear such a case surely exists when not only does the Federal Court have 
  concurrent jurisdiction to deal with the matter, it also has expertise and experience 
  in immigration law, administrative law and Federal Court procedure, the core 
  issues of the respondent's application. She also found it significant that the 
  Federal Court has an exclusive mandate over immigration matters and found the 
  principles from Peiroo v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1989), 
  69 O.R. (2d) 253 (dealing with habeas corpus), were applicable. Abella J.A. 
  noted that the failure to decline to exercise jurisdiction would raise concerns 
  over forum-shopping, inconsistency and multiplicity of proceedings.</p>
<p>[13] In our view, those principles apply in this case. In light of this conclusion, 
  it is unnecessary to consider the application judge's obiter statement that 
  in any event she would have dismissed the application on its merits. Accordingly, 
  the appeal is dismissed.</p>
