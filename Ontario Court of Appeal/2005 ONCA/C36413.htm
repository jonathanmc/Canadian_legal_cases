    Latoski stabbed one person to death and seriously wounded another in an alley 
    outside a tavern in Windsor, Ontario. He was charged with second degree murder 
    and attempted murder, and was tried before Thomson J. and a jury. The jury 
    found him guilty of both charges. The trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment 
    with no eligibility for parole for twenty five years on the murder conviction, 
    and twenty five years imprisonment to be served concurrently on the attempted 
    murder conviction.</p>

    Latoski appeals both his convictions and his sentence. He raises numerous 
    grounds of appeal against conviction, which he has grouped into four areas: 
    the trial judge misdirected the jury on the <i>mens rea</i> for attempted 
    murder; the trial judge misdirected the jury on the meaning of recklessness 
    in the second prong of the <i>mens rea</i> for murder; the trial judge failed 
    to answer a question from the jury properly; and the trial judge committed 
    several errors in his conduct of the trial and in his charge, which cumulatively 
    had the effect of unfairly denigrating the defence. On his sentence appeal, 
    the appellant submits that imposing the maximum parole ineligibility period 
    was excessive.</p>

    </span> The two victims, the deceased Bill Dodd and Clarence “Bobby” Boutilier 
    were “regulars” at a Windsor tavern, known as the Spotted Dog. On the evening 
    of May 16, 1999, they were in the tavern playing cribbage and celebrating 
    Dodd’s twenty ninth birthday. The appellant was also in the tavern that evening. 
    He approached Dodd and Boutilier, and made a racist comment. Boutilier took 
    exception to the comment and told the appellant to stop bothering them. This 
    rebuff, apparently, was the appellant’s motive for his later attack. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> When Dodd and Boutilier left the Spotted Dog they were both drunk. 
    They went out by a back door, which led to an alley. They were no more than 
    a few steps beyond the door when the appellant came up to Boutilier and stabbed 
    him in the shoulder with a knife. Boutilier kicked at the appellant, who then 
    stabbed him a second time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The bartender then came out into the alley. She realized that Dodd 
    had forgotten his sunglasses and went to look for him. She saw Boutilier holding 
    his bleeding chest. He pointed at the appellant and said “he stabbed me.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The bartender went back inside the tavern to telephone 9-1-1. She 
    asked two other patrons in the bar<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>- 
    Tom Savage and Detlef Kelbert – to get Boutilier inside, but he refused to 
    go.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Kelbert and Savage remained outside. Dodd walked toward the appellant 
    but stayed about five feet away, with the palms of his hands up. The appellant, 
    who was a much bigger man, had his back to the wall. He repeatedly stabbed 
    Dodd in the chest. Savage, Kelbert and Boutilier all saw the stabbing. After 
    Dodd staggered and fell down, the appellant hurried off up the alley. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    he put his knife in a flower pot. The police searched the area and retrieved 
    the knife. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant claimed that Boutilier and Dodd tried to rob him at 
    knifepoint, and that he fended them off with his own pocket knife. He said 
    that he stabbed at Boutilier and then Dodd because he feared for his own safety 
    and wanted to prevent them from stabbing him. Neither of the two witnesses 
    to the altercation – Kelbert and Savage – saw a knife in either Boutilier’s 
    or Dodd’s hands. In their admittedly cursory search of the area the police 
    found only one knife, the appellant’s.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The medical evidence disclosed that Dodd had seven stab wounds to 
    his chest and various defensive wounds to his left arm and hand. He died from 
    shock and the hemorrhaging caused by these wounds.</p>
  <h1 style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'>C. THE 
    <span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>Conviction APPEAL</span></span></h1>
  <h1 style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'>I. The 
    trial judge’ s instruction on the <i>mens rea</i> for attempted murder</span></h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge told the jury that the <i>mens rea</i> for attempted 
    murder is the same as the <i>mens rea</i> for murder – that is, the person 
    must mean to cause the victim’s death (section 229)(a)(i) of the <i>Criminal 
    Code</i>) or must mean to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to 
    cause his death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not (section 229(a)(ii) 
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>). The Crown acknowledged that this instruction 
    is contrary to the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>R. v. Ancio</i> 
    (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 385. In that case the Supreme Court held that the <i>mens 
    rea</i> for attempted murder is only the specific intent to kill and does 
    not include the “lesser” intent in Section 229 (a)(ii) of the <i>Code</i>. 
    Although the trial Crown brought <i>Ancio</i> to the trial judge’s attention, 
    he failed to re-charge the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The prejudice to the appellant 
    flowing from the trial judge’s erroneous instruction is that it permitted 
    the jury to find the appellant guilty of attempted murder when he had something 
    less than the specific intent to cause death. For that reason, the conviction 
    for the attempted murder of Boutilier cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> However, counsel for the appellant fairly concedes that the trial 
    judge’s instruction would sustain a conviction for the included offence of 
    aggravated assault. The trial judge’s charge on the elements of aggravated 
    assault was correct. At trial, the defence conceded that Boutilier was wounded 
    and that his life was endangered. If the jury found the appellant guilty of 
    attempted murder on the basis of an intent to cause bodily harm that would 
    likely cause death, then the jury necessarily would also have convicted the 
    appellant of aggravated assault. Accordingly, I would set aside the conviction 
    for attempted murder and substitute a conviction for aggravated assault.</p>
  <h1 style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'>II. The 
    trial judge’s instruction on recklessness </span></h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant submits that in reviewing the second prong of the <i>mens 
    rea</i> for murder under section 229(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the 
    trial judge misdirected the jury on the recklessness component. The trial 
    judge told the jury that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Recklessness is the attitude and conduct of one 
    who sees the risk and takes the chance. In other words, recklessness is found 
    in the attitude of one who is aware that there is danger, that his conduct 
    could bring about certain results, and persists despite the risk. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant contends that this instruction diluted the intent required 
    to meet the <i>mens rea</i> for murder under section 229(a)(ii). He says that 
    by using the phrase: “. . . danger, that is his conduct could bring about 
    certain results” the trial judge invited the jury to convict on a lower standard 
    – knowledge of possible consequences – than the standard required by the statute 
    - likely consequences. The appellant contends that the trial judge’s formulation 
    prejudiced his defence. He points out that in defence of the charges he relied 
    on provocation and self-defence. He testified that he did not realize the 
    knife swings he used to fend off his attackers had connected. He submits that 
    the jury may have convicted on the trial judge’s formulation but may have 
    found a reasonable doubt on a proper formulation. </p>

    </span> Looked at in isolation, the trial judge’s direction on recklessness 
    appears to be wrong. In <i>R. v. Czibulka</i> (2004), 189 C.C.C. (3d) 199 
    at paras. 66-68 (Ont.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2004] S.C.C.A. 
    No. 502,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rosenberg J.A. affirmed what 
    the Supreme Court of Canada had said over a decade earlier in <i>R. v. Cooper</i> 
    (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 295: “[I]t is not sufficient that the accused 
    foresee simply a danger of death; the accused must foresee a likelihood of 
    death flowing from the bodily harm that he is occasioning the victim.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> However, the trial judge’s direction on recklessness has to be assessed 
    in the context of his entire instructions on the <i>mens rea</i> for murder. 
    As the Crown points out in her factum the trial judge correctly recited the 
    <i>mens rea</i> for murder six times. Each time the trial judge told the jury 
    that to convict on this second prong it must be satisfied beyond a reasonable 
    doubt that the appellant intended to cause bodily harm he knew was likely 
    to cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not. His third and 
    fourth recitals bracketed the impugned passage on recklessness. Thus that 
    entire portion of the charge read as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>The 
    first branch of that intent, that is, an intention to kill is given its plain 
    meaning and is readily understood. The second branch requires that the accused 
    intended to cause bodily harm of such grave nature that he knew his actions 
    were likely to result in the victim’s death or the wound to Boutilier. <u>The 
    accused must one, foresee that his intentional causing of bodily harm was 
    likely to cause death, and two, deliberately disregard the fatal consequences, 
    that is, he must be reckless whether death ensues or not.</u></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>Recklessness 
    is the attitude and conduct of one who sees the risk and takes the chance. 
    In other words, recklessness is found in the attitude of one who aware that 
    there is danger, that his conduct could bring about certain results, and persists 
    despite the risk. You will consider whether you have been satisfied beyond 
    a reasonable doubt that when the accused inflicted the fatal wound, he intended 
    firstly, to kill Dodd and wound Clarence Boutilier or secondly, <u>to cause 
    them bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether 
    death ensued or not</u> [emphasis added]. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> As the underlined parts show, the trial judge properly focused the 
    jury’s consideration on likely consequences. Heard in context, the jury would 
    have taken the judge’s reference to “danger” to mean simply the danger or 
    risk that the appellant’s actions would cause bodily harm that the appellant 
    knew was likely to cause death. Defence counsel likely understood it the same 
    way for he did not object to this part of the charge: see <i>R. v. Edelenbos</i> 
    (2004), 187 C.C.C. (3d) 465 (Ont. C.A.). Accordingly, I would not give effect 
    to this ground of appeal.</p>

  </p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:

    Do you want attempt murder and attempt as well?</span></p>

    </span> The trial judge responded to the request by reading out the relevant 
    sections of the <i>Criminal Code </i>and giving copies of these sections to 
    the jury. Neither the Crown nor the defence asked him to do anything more. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> On appeal, however, the appellant argues that the trial judge should 
    have explained the various elements of these offences as he did in his main 
    charge, and should also have re-charged on the defences of provocation and 
    self-defence. The appellant says that his failure to do so amounts to a reversible 
    error. I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> First, the trial judge gave the jury what it asked for.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The jury did not express any concern that it 
    wanted anything more. Moreover, when he had complied with its request, the 
    trial judge specifically asked the jury “does that cover your request?” The 
    jury obviously signalled that it did because the trial judge then said “all 
    right”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Second, the copies of the sections of the <i>Code</i> given to the 
    jury were not annotated. And the trial judge twice told the jury – once at 
    the beginning of his charge and once at the end – that they were required 
    to take the law from him. Thus I see no real risk that the jurors would have 
    put their own interpretation on the elements of the offences. I would not 
    give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

    </span> The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in six ways in his 
    conduct of the trial and his charge and that, taken together, these errors 
    denigrated the defence and resulted in an unfair trial. We called on the Crown 
    only on the first two alleged errors. </p>

    </span> The trial judge instructed the jury that it could take into account 
    the appellant’s conduct after the stabbing when he encountered the police, 
    in determining whether he was aware he had committed a culpable act and whether 
    he acted in self-defence. The appellant acknowledges that the trial judge 
    was entitled to instruct the jury on the appellant’s post-offence conduct 
    but submits that he did not do so fairly because he did not tell the jury 
    the appellant’s innocent explanation for his conduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I agree that the trial judge’s review of the appellant’s position 
    was not as thorough as it should have been. But I am also of the view that 
    his charge on the appellant’s post-offence conduct did not cause a miscarriage 
    of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant’s conduct after the stabbing was as follows. As the 
    police arrived on the scene, the appellant threw his knife in a flower pot. 
    One of the officers testified that the appellant walked past him “calm, cool 
    and collected”. The officer told the appellant to stop. But the appellant 
    kept walking, went around the corner, and stopped only after the officer drew 
    his gun and repeated his command. Another officer retrieved the knife from 
    the flower pot. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The Crown argued that the jury could use this evidence to support 
    an inference the appellant did not act in self-defence: a man claiming to 
    be the victim would be expected to run to the police, not to try to avoid 
    them and hide his weapon. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant, on the other hand, denied fleeing the police. He claimed 
    that he was glad to see the police cruiser, and walked right up to it. He 
    testified that although he threw the knife in the flower pot because he did 
    not want the police to see him walking down the street with<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>it, he deliberately put it in a place where 
    it would easily be found.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge reviewed the Crown’s position in detail. By contrast, 
    he dealt with the appellant’s explanation for his conduct summarily, telling 
    the jury only that the appellant’s position was “that he felt the whole thing 
    would be cleared up shortly”. The trial judge compounded his inadequate review 
    of the appellant’s position by telling the jury that the appellant did not 
    say anything to the police officer when he had an opportunity to do so. This 
    was perhaps unfair. The appellant’s position was that he did give an explanation 
    to the officer but the trial judge refused to let him give this explanation 
    in the witness box on the ground that it would be self-serving.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Although I consider the trial judge’s charge on the appellant’s post-offence 
    conduct to have been inadequate, I do not think that it caused a miscarriage 
    of justice for at least four reasons. First, the appellant’s post-offence 
    conduct was not an important element of the Crown’s case. The Crown’s case 
    turned primarily on the evidence of Boutilier and the two independent witnesses, 
    Savage and Kelbert. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Second, the appellant offered no convincing explanation for the most 
    incriminating aspect of his conduct, his throwing away the knife. Third, the 
    appellant never claimed that he acted in panic, so the jury was unlikely to 
    have misinterpreted his conduct. Finally, the defence did not object to this 
    part of the charge. I would therefore not give effect to the appellant’s submission 
    on the charge on post-offence conduct.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant testified that before the stabbing in the alley and 
    for much of the evening he sat in the tavern with Mr. Matt Zanatta. The appellant 
    denied approaching Boutilier and making racist remarks; instead he claimed 
    Boutilier approached Zanatta and said something rude to him. Although he could 
    not recall the specific remark, the appellant said that he was sufficiently 
    concerned about it to walk Zanatta out of the bar. Boutilier denied making 
    any such remark. Neither side called Matt Zanatta as a witness at the trial. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Twice in his charge the trial judge said that Zanatta was not called 
    as a witness. The appellant contends that the trial judge’s two comments invited 
    the jury to draw the adverse inference that Zanatta’s evidence would not have 
    helped the defence and that therefore the appellant’s version of what occurred 
    in the tavern was not truthful. I do not accept the appellant’s contention. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In my view the trial judge’s two comments did not prejudice the defence. 
    He first said that Zanatta was not called as a witness during his review of 
    the bartender Margaret Stanley’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Marg Stanley was there. She had seen the accused 
    earlier in the week when he bought drinks for some people and paid with a 
    hundred dollar bill. She did not see any objectionable interaction between 
    Latoski, Billie or Bobby. Latoski approached them but she did not hear any 
    of the discussion. She knew Matt Zanatta but did not recall him being there 
    that evening. It is important for you to remember that Matt Zanatta was never 
    called as a witness in this trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> He said it a second time during his review of the appellant’s evidence. 
  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Latoski also denied he made any racist remarks to 
    either Bobby or Tom Savage. You might well find it strange that Bobby recounted 
    certain words attributable to Latoski. Some time later in a totally unrelated 
    scenario, Savage said Latoski used much the same words. Again, for you to 
    decide. He denied he was a general and said that was just a story. He said 
    he had been carrying a knife since he was a little boy. He said he was concerned 
    about Matt Zanatta and the interaction between Matt Zanatta and Bobby. We 
    never heard from Matt Zanatta. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Both references were neutral and, in my view, harmless. In neither 
    instance did the trial judge say that the defence should have called Zanatta. 
    And in neither instance did the trial judge tell the jury that it could or 
    should draw an adverse inference from the defence’s failure to call Zanatta. 
    Moreover, although in his closing the Crown referred to the appellant’s story 
    about Zanatta, the Crown did not comment on the appellant’s failure to call 
    Zanatta and indeed had not tried to cross examine him on his not doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I expect as well that even had the trial judge said nothing about 
    Zanatta, the jury’s common sense would have led it to conclude that Zanatta’s 
    evidence could not have helped the defence. Matt Zanatta was eighty years 
    old and a “regular” at the tavern. Both the bartender and the owner described 
    him as a “pet” and said that other “regulars” were protective of him. This 
    made it highly unlikely that regulars such as Boutilier would make the remark 
    the appellant attributed to him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    6 The Reports 67 to prevent the appellant from eliciting certain evidence 
    in his defence because that evidence had not been put to Crown witnesses. 
    We were not persuaded that the trial judge erred in applying <i>Browne v.</i> 
    <i>Dunn</i>. But, equally important, neither application of the rule prejudiced 
    the appellant.</p>

    questioning, or to discuss the matter in the absence of the jury, or to ask 
    that the Crown witness (Boutilier) be recalled. In the second instance the 
    evidence that the trial judge sought to preclude came out anyway. Thus, the

    dismissed it. On appeal, the appellant argued that the<span

    (1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 1 at 6, this court held that in<span style="mso-spacerun:

    </span> First, the trial judge ruled that certain utterances made by the appellant 
    to the police officers on the scene were admissible though the appellant had 
    not yet been given his right to counsel. He so ruled because he found that 
    the appellant was not detained when he made the utterances. That finding is 
    likely unsupportable. However, the trial judge’s ruling was immaterial because 
    the Crown did not seek to elicit these utterances at trial.</p>

    </span> Second, the appellant complained that effectively he was denied his 
    right to counsel because one of the officers at the station would not permit 
    him to use a phone in private unless he told the officer the lawyer whom he 
    intended to call. I think that the officer was justified in insisting that 
    the appellant first provide him with the name of the lawyer he wished to call.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>But even if the officer was not justified, within a short time two 
    other officers gave the appellant his right to counsel and ample opportunity 
    to exercise it. The appellant chose not to do so because he wanted to hear 
    what the officers had to say and because he did not think that he had done 
    anything wrong. In the words of the trial judge, he had an almost irresistible 
    urge to tell his side of the story.</p>

    </span> Third, the appellant testified on the <i>voir dire</i> and then the 
    Crown cross examined him. The trial judge rejected much of the appellant’s 
    evidence. The appellant complained that parts of the Crown’s cross examination 
    were impermissible. He pointed to the Crown’s cross examination on aliases 
    he had used, on parole violations, on whether he was on parole at the time 
    of the incident, and on the details of his criminal record beyond the details 
    permitted under the <i>Canada Evidence Act </i>R.S. 1985, c.C-5.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I accept that the cross examination on the 
    parole violations was improper because under section 12 of the <i>Canada Evidence</i> 
    <i>Act</i> parole violations are not convictions. I also accept that the cross 
    examination on the details of the appellant’s record probably went further 
    than it should have. However, these transgressions were minor at best. In 
    the light of the appellant’s lengthy criminal record, they had little bearing 
    on the trial judge’s adverse credibility assessment.</p>

    </span> The appellant submitted that the trial judge unnecessarily exhorted 
    the jury and by doing so gave the jury the impression this was a simple case 
    and it ought to have no trouble rendering a guilty verdict. We disagreed with 
    this submission. </p>

    </span> The jury retired to consider its verdict on June 20, 2001 at 1:35 
    p.m. It was called back for a brief re-charge and also came back to ask two 
    questions. At 9:50 p.m., the trial judge gave the jurors a mild exhortation. 
    He said: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:
"Times New \(W1\)";text-transform:uppercase'>The court</span>: Ladies and gentlemen, 
    you have been here since early this morning and you have been deliberating 
    about eight and a half hours or so at the present time. It appears you are 
    having some difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. Will some more time 
    this evening assist you in arriving at a unanimous verdict?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:
"Times New \(W1\)";text-transform:uppercase'>Juror</span>: I don’t think so.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:
"Times New \(W1\)";text-transform:uppercase'>The court</span>: I’m sorry, you 
    don’t think so? All right, it’s a yes or no answer. I don’t want to hear anything 
    more about it. All right, if that’s the case we are going to adjourn for the 
    evening. I understand hotel accommodations have been made for you and staff 
    will be able to accommodate you. Do you think you will be able to arrive at 
    a verdict tomorrow?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:
"Times New \(W1\)";text-transform:uppercase'>Juror</span>: Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:
"Times New \(W1\)";text-transform:uppercase'>The court</span>: Okay, let me just 
    address you briefly and perhaps refresh you on what we are all doing here. 
    While it is not imperative that you do so, it is obviously desirable that 
    you reach a unanimous verdict. You have sworn to give a true verdict based 
    upon the evidence and that you must do your utmost to achieve that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I have the discretion to discharge you from giving 
    a verdict where it appears that further deliberations will be futile. However, 
    this power should not be exercised lightly or too quickly. Frequently when 
    juries are given more time to deliberate, they are able to reach an agreement. 
    My objective is not to convince you to change your minds but rather to encourage 
    you to present your own view of the evidence to your fellow jurors to ensure 
    that everyone’s opinion has been duly considered.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While you may have already formed an opinion as 
    to the proper verdict, I would ask that you still keep an open mind and carefully 
    consider your colleagues’ viewpoints. However, in reconsidering your position 
    I remind you that at the beginning of the trial each of you took an oath to 
    return a true verdict according to the evidence. It is crucial that no one 
    betray that oath. Therefore, your verdict must be based on the evidence alone 
    and you must not allow yourselves to be influenced by any extraneous considerations. 
  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The essence of the jury system is the process of 
    reasoning together by exchanging views and deliberating together. It is expected 
    that you will pool your views of the evidence and listen carefully to one 
    another. This means that there must be some give and take in the exchange 
    of opinion. I must emphasize that this does not<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>mean you should subordinate your own genuinely held view of the evidence 
    for the sake of reaching a consensus. It is of course desirable that a unanimous 
    verdict be rendered but this may be one of those occasions when you are unable 
    to do so. This will not reflect badly upon you provided that you have made 
    an honest effort to try the case to the best of your abilities.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore, I would ask you tomorrow to try once 
    again to reach a verdict.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>This is the time to reflect further on the evidence and see if by 
    listening to each other and thinking overnight you can come to an agreement 
    and render a unanimous verdict…</p>

    </span> In her factum, Crown counsel fairly acknowledged that there was “no 
    pressing need to exhort the jury”. These were serious charges; the jury had 
    not been deliberating for a long time; and the jury had not indicated that 
    it was deadlocked.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> However, the exhortation was harmless. It amounted to nothing more 
    than encouraging the jury to carry on with its deliberations the next day. 
    The trial judge did not denigrate the defence. He did not suggest that this 
    was a simple or overwhelming Crown case. He did not impose a time limit or 
    a deadline. And he did not introduce extraneous or inappropriate factors into 
    the jury’s deliberations. See <i>R. v. Kwoba</i> [1998], O.J. No. 81 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> For these brief reasons I am not persuaded that the trial judge’s 
    conduct of the trial or his charge deprived the appellant of a fair trial. 
    I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> On the appellant’s conviction for the murder of Dodd, the trial judge 
    imposed the maximum parole ineligibility period of twenty five years. On his 
    conviction for the attempted murder of Boutilier, the trial judge sentenced 
    the appellant to twenty five years imprisonment to be served concurrently. 
    As I would set aside the conviction for attempted murder and substitute a 
    conviction for aggravated assault, I would also set aside the twenty five 
    year sentence and substitute a sentence of fifteen years imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The key issue on the sentence appeal is whether a twenty five year 
    parole ineligibility period is demonstrably unfit. The appellant says that 
    it is and argues for a period between eighteen and twenty years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In determining whether to increase the parole ineligibility period 
    for second degree murder beyond the mandatory ten years, the sentencing judge 
    must take into account the jury’s recommendations, the character of the offender, 
    the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission: 
    see section 745.4 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The trial judge took account 
    of these considerations. Although the maximum period is rarely imposed I am 
    not persuaded that the trial judge committed a reviewable error in imposing 
    it in this case. I will summarize the evidence that supports the trial judge’s 
    disposition. </p>

    </span> <u>(a) The jury recommendations</u>:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none'>Seven jurors 
    recommended twenty five years; one recommended twenty years; two recommended 
    fifteen <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>years; and two made no recommendation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> <u>(b) The character of the offender</u>:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none'>The appellant 
    is not a youthful offender. He was fifty four years old at the time of the 
    offences and fifty five at the time of sentencing. He is an incorrigible criminal. 
    His criminal record dates back to 1963. It includes numerous offences of violence: 
    four convictions for robbery, and convictions for assault causing bodily harm, 
    assaulting a police officer, and assault with a weapon.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In the past twenty five years the appellant has spent less than one 
    hundred and eighty days in the community. During this twenty five years, he 
    was released on parole six times, and each time violated his parole conditions 
    and was returned to custody. Indeed the appellant had been released on parole 
    less than one month before he committed these offences. He breached the conditions 
    of his parole the same day he was released when he failed to report to the 
    British Columbia parole authorities. These parole authorities learned of his 
    whereabouts only when contacted by the Windsor police in connection with the 
    current offences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge found no mitigating considerations that would favour 
    any leniency for the appellant. His counsel on appeal could not suggest any 
    either. The appellant has shown no remorse for what he did. He has made no 
    effort to rehabilitate himself while incarcerated or even to acknowledge his 
    two major problems: anger management and substance abuse. The parole authorities 
    consider that if released he is likely to commit yet another offence of violence. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> <u>(c) The nature of the offences and the circumstances surrounding 
    their commission</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none'>The appellant 
    perpetrated his violent acts on two unsuspecting, unarmed and inebriated persons. 
    He took Boutilier by surprise, stabbing him right after he left the tavern. 
    Dodd, who was killed, was especially vulnerable. Not only was he highly intoxicated, 
    he was much smaller than the appellant. Yet the appellant stabbed him in the 
    chest seven times. These offences were unprovoked and committed with no apparent 
    motive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Upholding the maximum parole ineligibility period means that the appellant 
    will be eighty years old when he is eligible to be released. That said, the 
    evidence I have summarized supports the trial judge’s sentence. I would not 
    interfere with it.</p>
  <h1 style='text-align:justify'><span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'>E. CONCLUSION</span></h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I would set aside the conviction for the attempted murder of Mr. Boutilier 
    and the sentence of twenty five years imprisonment and would substitute a 
    conviction for aggravated assault and a sentence for that offence of fifteen 
    years imprisonment. I would dismiss both the conviction and sentence appeal 
    in respect of the murder of Mr. Dodd. </p>
