  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>On appeal from the conviction and sentence entered 
    by Justice Eugene G. Ewaschuk and a jury of the Superior Court of Justice, 
    dated January 14, 2001.</h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>Laskin J.A.:</h4>
  <h1>A.             Introduction</h1>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
         On Sunday afternoon, June 13, 1999, in a parking lot next to a housing 
    complex in the Jane and Finch area of Toronto, Warren Blackstock was shot 
    five times in the chest as he was getting ready to drive away in his car with 
    his three-year-old daughter, Brianna Davy. Blackstock survived the shooting, 
    though he was paralysed from the waist down. Tragically, Brianna was struck 
    in the head by a stray bullet and died instantly.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
         The appellant, Craig Patrick, was charged with the first-degree murder 
    of Brianna and the attempted murder of Blackstock. He was tried before Ewaschuk 
    J. and a jury. The issue at trial was whether the appellant was the shooter. 
    No eyewitnesses identified him, and no forensic evidence linked him to the 
    crime scene. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
         The Crown’s case relied in part on circumstantial evidence of motive, 
    opportunity, and the appellant’s conduct after the shooting. But it was mainly 
    based on Blackstock’s identification of the appellant as the shooter. The 
    appellant testified and denied that he was the shooter. He maintained that 
    at the time of the incident he was playing basketball with a group of people 
    at a nearby court.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
         The jury found the appellant guilty on both counts. On the count of first-degree 
    murder he was sentenced, as the law requires, to life imprisonment with no 
    eligibility for parole for twenty-five years. On the count of attempted murder, 
    he was sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [5]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
         The appellant appeals both convictions. He raises numerous grounds of 
    appeal. His principal ground is that the trial judge erred in law in refusing 
    to give a <i>Vetrovec<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""> [1] </a></i> 
    warning for the evidence of Blackstock. He submits that a warning to the jury 
    about the danger of relying on Blackstock’s evidence was mandatory because 
    Blackstock was unsavoury, his identification testimony was fraught with inconsistencies, 
    and yet his evidence was central to the Crown’s case. I agree with this submission. 
    On this ground of appeal alone, I would set aside the convictions and order 
    a new trial.  Because the trial judge’s failure to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> 
    warning is decisive of the appeal, I will not deal with the other grounds 
    of appeal raised by the appellant.</p>
  <h3>B.             Overview of the evidence</h3>
  <h3>(a)       The relationship between Blackstock, the appellant, and Gardness</h3>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [6]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    At trial, Blackstock identified the appellant – known to him as “Titus” – 
    as the shooter. He said they had first met about six months before the shooting 
    at a Boxing Day dance. Blackstock had financed the dance with a man named 
    Gardness. The appellant knew Gardness and was helping as a doorman. After 
    the dance, Blackstock and Gardness had a falling out. According to Blackstock, 
    Gardness kept most of the profits from the dance. Yet he was spreading rumours 
    that Blackstock had robbed him.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [7]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Blackstock testified that after the Boxing Day dance, he saw the appellant 
    only about three times. On June 12, the day before the shooting, they saw 
    each other at a beach party at Wasaga Beach. According to Blackstock, the 
    appellant was “clocking him” – watching him closely and giving him dirty looks. 
    The appellant, however, testified that they neither spoke nor made eye contact 
    at the beach party. That evening the two saw each other again at a party in 
    downtown Toronto in a building called “The Palisades.”</p>
  <h3>(b)             Evidence of the appellant’s motive: the pistol whipping 
    at The Palisades</h3>
  <p style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'> [8]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Ironically the Crown’s evidence of motive came not from Blackstock but from 
    the testimony of the appellant and of a mutual friend, Kwami Mingo. The testimony 
    concerned an incident at the party at The Palisades the night before the shooting.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [9]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The appellant arrived at the party at about midnight and left at about 2 a.m. 
    As he stepped out of the elevator on the ground floor, he saw Blackstock getting 
    off another elevator. According to the appellant, Blackstock approached him, 
    grabbed his shoulder, and spun him around. The appellant tried to walk away, 
    but Blackstock grabbed him again and ripped his shirt. Blackstock then pulled 
    out a gun and shoved it in the appellant’s face and said that if the appellant 
    and his friends thought they were all so tough he would “wipe all of you guys 
    out.” Later, a girl who had witnessed the assault told the appellant that 
    Blackstock was sorry for what had happened. The appellant testified that this 
    made him feel a little better and “glad at least there would be no further 
    problems between me and this man.”</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Kwami Mingo testified that he had seen Blackstock on the Sunday morning before 
    the shooting. Blackstock told Mingo that he had pistol-whipped someone the 
    night before. According to Mingo, Blackstock appeared remorseful and was on 
    his way to extend an apology through Mingo’s sister. Just after noon, Mingo 
    saw Blackstock again. Blackstock admitted to pulling a gun on the appellant 
    the night before and appeared to be embarrassed about the incident.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [11]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    A short while later, Mingo saw the appellant near a basketball court. The 
    appellant did not look well and his face was scratched. The appellant told 
    Mingo that Blackstock had pistol-whipped him the night before. Mingo told 
    the appellant not to worry about it. The appellant seemed “pissed” at Blackstock 
    but told Mingo that he had spoken to “one of the girls,” that everything was 
    all right, and that he had put the incident behind him. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [12]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    After speaking to both the appellant and Blackstock, Mingo thought that their 
    argument was not serious and that any hostilities between the two had dissipated.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [13]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Blackstock gave an entirely different version of what had occurred at The 
    Palisades. He admitted that he had seen the appellant there, near the elevators. 
    He confronted him and said,  “This is not your argument. This is me and Gardness, 
    right.” However, Blackstock denied that he pulled out a gun and pistol-whipped 
    the appellant. He testified that after speaking to the appellant they went 
    their separate ways.</p>
  <h3>(c)       The shooting</h3>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [14]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    On Sunday afternoon June 13, Blackstock went to his mother’s house to pick 
    up his daughter Brianna. He saw the appellant in the neighbourhood near a 
    basketball court with four or five other men.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [15]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    After picking up Brianna, Blackstock walked toward the lot where his car was 
    parked. As he did so, Mingo, who was nearby, called out to him, “it done happened 
    already” and mumbled something that Blackstock could not hear. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [16]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Blackstock testified that he unlocked his car doors and put Brianna in the 
    front passenger seat. The windows were rolled up and the sunroof was slightly 
    ajar.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [17]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Blackstock closed the passenger door and walked around to the driver’s side 
    of the car. He testified that as he opened the door he saw “shadows” in the 
    mirror, which he thought were caused by two men moving toward him. While he 
    was outside the car Blackstock heard a gunshot. He thought that he had been 
    shot in the back. He heard two more shots. He thought that these had hit him 
    in the back as well. Then he passed out. However, he recalled struggling with 
    the shooter, whom he identified as the appellant. He pushed the gun away and 
    managed to open his car door. The shooter fired another shot at Blackstock 
    and then ran from the parking lot.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [18]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Blackstock testified that he got into the car, started it, and reversed it.  
    He could not move the left side of his body. The car rolled back and hit a 
    van. However, he managed to roll down the window and tell a friend, who had 
    arrived at the scene, to call his mother. He then lapsed into unconsciousness.</p>
  <h3>(d)             Blackstock’s previous inconsistent statements to the police 
  </h3>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [19]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Blackstock gave two key statements to the police: the first on the morning 
    of June 15 – two days after the shooting – while he was still in the hospital; 
    the second on June 21 – after the appellant had been arrested. The two statements 
    were entirely different. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [20]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    In his June 15 statement, Blackstock said that he was sitting in his car when 
    he saw the shooter in a side-view mirror. There was only one shooter and he 
    wore a blue bandana over the lower part of his face. Blackstock could not 
    identify him. When the police asked who had shot him, Blackstock replied, 
    “It could be a lot of people.” He named Gardness and the appellant. Blackstock 
    then asked to see a photographic lineup. The police produced one that included 
    the appellant. However, Blackstock did not identify the appellant or anyone 
    else in the lineup. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [21]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    At trial, Blackstock testified that he did not remember making the June 15 
    statement. In cross-examination he was asked whether he was telling the truth 
    when he told the police that he did not know who shot him. He said “no.” He 
    was then asked, “You lied to her [the officer] at that time?” and he answered, 
    “Yeah.” </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [22]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    By the time Blackstock gave his June 21 statement to the police, he knew the 
    appellant had been arrested, he had read several newspaper articles about 
    the arrest, he had seen the appellant’s picture in the paper, and he had been 
    visited by members of his family.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [23]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    In his second statement, Blackstock told the police that two men had approached 
    his car. One hour and twenty minutes into his interview with the police, he 
    claimed that one of the men was the appellant, whose face was uncovered. The 
    other man, whom Blackstock could not identify, left the scene and did not 
    take part in the shooting. The police questioned Blackstock about the appellant. 
    Blackstock said that he had no idea why the appellant would shoot him because 
    they were not enemies. In neither his June 21 nor his June 15 statement did 
    Blackstock tell the police he had spoken to or even seen the appellant at 
    The Palisades. </p>
  <h3>(e)       The forensic evidence </h3>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [24]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Blackstock had three wounds on the front of his body and two wounds on his 
    back. The doctors removed two bullets. One bullet that had been lodged in 
    the right side of his abdomen likely caused his paralysis. The defence’s position 
    was that Blackstock was seated in the driver’s seat of his car at the time 
    of the shooting and moved his body toward the passenger side when he was shot 
    so that he was unlikely to have seen his assailant. The Crown’s position was 
    that Blackstock was outside the car when he was shot and was able to identify 
    the appellant. The forensic evidence led at trial was neutral. It certainly 
    did not support the Crown’s position. </p>
  <h3>(f)        The “Titus” statements</h3>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [25]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Two witnesses testified that before he was taken into the hospital, Blackstock 
    identified the appellant as the shooter. One witness was Althea Eldemire, 
    a good friend of Blackstock. The other was Delroy McGregor, Blackstock’s stepfather. 
    However each one’s evidence conflicted with the other’s, and both of their 
    accounts were inconsistent with the evidence of the officers at the scene 
    and with the evidence of Blackstock. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [26]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Eldemire, McGregor, and a third person, Vernon Khan, drove Blackstock to the 
    hospital. Once there, Eldemire took Brianna’s body into the emergency ward. 
    She then went back out to the car and stood near Blackstock’s head. Eldemire 
    said,  “[i]f you know who did this to you tell us before you go in there and 
    something should happen to you.” According to Eldemire, Blackstock whispered 
    “Titus” three times. However she had trouble hearing what he said; she was 
    upset and she was confused. She was even unsure whether she had told the police 
    officers about the Titus statements.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [27]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    McGregor gave a different version of what had occurred outside the hospital. 
    He testified that when Eldemire took Brianna into the emergency ward, he said 
    to Blackstock “tell me who did this to you.” Blackstock replied, “Titus did 
    it.” He said it only once. A police officer nearby asked McGregor whom Blackstock 
    had named. McGregor  responded, “don’t ask me that question now.” Then, according 
    to McGregor, the officer asked him, “did he say Titus?” and McGregor replied, 
    “yes, that’s the name he used”. At trial McGregor testified that Blackstock 
    was having trouble talking and that he may have misheard what Blackstock was 
    saying.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [28]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    None of the three police officers present outside the hospital saw or heard 
    Blackstock being questioned by either Eldemire or McGregor. One of the officers 
    described Eldemire as “hysterical.” This officer asked Blackstock if he knew 
    who shot him. Blackstock did not answer. The officer described Blackstock’s 
    condition as follows: </p>
  <p>“He didn’t even acknowledge me. There was no verbal response and no physical 
    response even looking up at me.”</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [29]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Another officer spoke to Eldemire, McGregor, and Khan at the hospital. The 
    Crown did not seek to elicit the contents of this conversation. However, during 
    the officer’s evidence the Crown played an audiotape of a police radio call 
    about ten minutes after the initial 9-1-1 call. In the tape, officers state 
    that they are looking for a man named Titus.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Blackstock testified that at the hospital he told both Eldemire and McGregor 
    that Titus was the shooter. However, he cannot remember whether he told anyone 
    before he got to the hospital. Moreover, in his June 21 statement he said 
    that he did not say anything to anyone in the car. All he remembered saying 
    was “yes” to questions posed by Eldemire.</p>
  <h3>(g)       The appellant and his alibi evidence</h3>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [31]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    At the time of his arrest the appellant was twenty-one-years old. He worked 
    as a forklift operator at a Grand &amp; Toy warehouse. He also did volunteer 
    work with children at a local recreation centre. He had youth court convictions 
    for property-related offences, and an adult criminal record for possession 
    of a narcotic, trafficking, carrying a concealed weapon (a knife), and being 
    unlawfully at large.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [32]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    He testified that after he saw Mingo in the early afternoon on Sunday June 
    13, he met up with a group of fifteen friends who were “chilling” out at the 
    local basketball court. The appellant played some basketball with them. While 
    he was at the court, the appellant saw Blackstock ride by on a bicycle. Twenty 
    minutes later, a neighbourhood kid nicknamed “So-For-Real” came by and told 
    the group that someone had been shot. He had heard that the victims were Warren 
    Blackstock and a baby. The appellant and the others in the group walked toward 
    the parking lot to see what had happened. As they did so, Blackstock’s sister 
    Juleen Blackstock confronted the appellant. She yelled, “if it’s you or any 
    of your friends who shot my brother you guys are gonna get it,” to which the 
    appellant replied, “Listen, man, I don’t have anything to do with anything 
    so could you please leave me out of whatever you’re trying to yell at me about 
    or whatever.”</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [33]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Neither the Crown nor the defence called Juleen Blackstock as a witness at 
    the trial. The appellant did not call So-For-Real and he neither called nor 
    named any of the fifteen people who were playing basketball. He testified 
    that when he was arrested he assumed that people from his neighbourhood would 
    come forward to tell the police that he had nothing to do with the shooting. 
    However, he also explained that his neighbourhood was ruled by the “G Code” 
    or Gangster Code. According to this Code, people would not speak to the police 
    even if they knew something about a crime. Those at the top, older people 
    who had “done more bad things,” would exact retribution on anyone who assisted 
    the police.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [34]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Both Blackstock and Mingo confirmed the existence of this neighbourhood Code. 
    Blackstock testified that people “straightened things out themselves” without 
    the assistance of the police. Mingo, who claimed not to remember anything 
    about the day of the shooting until the trial judge found him in contempt 
    of court, said that the culture of “the Jane” meant the police would have 
    difficulty finding witnesses who would cooperate. </p>
  <h3>(h)       The appellant’s conduct after the shooting</h3>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [35]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    At 9 p.m. on the night of the shooting the appellant went to work at Grand 
    &amp; Toy. At 2 a.m. his sister came to see him and told him that people in 
    the neighbourhood were saying that he was involved in the shooting. The appellant 
    left work early and accompanied his sister to her house in Scarborough. He 
    testified that he was concerned his life would be in danger if he went to 
    his own house. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [36]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The next morning the appellant met with his lawyer and talked to his mother 
    and other members of his family. That evening he returned to his own residence 
    at Jane and Finch, and then left for work. As he was driving, he heard on 
    the radio that he was wanted for the shooting.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [37]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The appellant testified that on hearing his name on the radio he started “freaking 
    out.” Instead of going to work, he stopped at a mall, called his cousin Rory 
    Ellis, and went to Ellis’s home in Ajax. That night he slept in the basement 
    of his cousin’s home. The next morning he sought advice from another cousin 
    named Patrick. After speaking with Patrick, the appellant decided to contact 
    his lawyer and turn himself in the following morning. He went out to get something 
    to eat for dinner, returned to Ellis’s house at about 10 p.m., and fell asleep 
    in the basement. The next day the police entered the house with a search warrant 
    and arrested the appellant. According to the arresting officer, the appellant 
    was hiding underneath a blanket behind a washing machine. </p>
  <h3>C.        The issues on the appeal</h3>
  <p><b>1.         The failure to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning</b></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [38]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in law in refusing to give 
    the jury a <i>Vetrovec </i>warning about the evidence of Warren Blackstock. 
    The appellant contends that the trial judge was required to give a clear, 
    sharp warning of the danger of acting on Blackstock’s evidence without confirmation 
    of it. The Crown argues that the trial judge acted within his broad discretion 
    in refusing to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning. Alternatively, the Crown contends 
    that the trial judge’s refusal to warn the jury about Blackstock’s evidence 
    caused no substantial wrong and that therefore this court should apply the 
    curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""> 
    [2] </a></i></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [39]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    A <i>Vetrovec</i> warning is “a clear and sharp warning to attract the attention 
    of the juror to the risks of adopting, without more, the evidence of the witness” 
    (at p.17). Although no particular language is required, the warning should 
    focus the jury’s attention on the potential untrustworthiness of the witness’s 
    evidence. It should refer to the characteristics of the witness that raise 
    serious questions about the witness’s credibility. And it should emphasize 
    the danger of convicting the accused on the witness’s evidence, unless that 
    evidence is confirmed by independent evidence: see <i>R. v. Brooks</i> (2000), 
    141 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) at para. 94.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [40]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Defence counsel asked the trial judge to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning for 
    Blackstock’s evidence. The trial judge would not do so. Although he did not 
    give a formal ruling, in his dialogue with counsel the trial judge indicated 
    that a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning was inappropriate because Blackstock was a 
    victim:</p>
  <p>The Court: Generally it would, and I’ve never seen it applied to a victim, 
    quite frankly. Generally it would apply to a situation where he or she participated 
    in a crime, which is the accomplice; or somehow he or she was a recipient 
    of a confession and had something to gain by testifying in favour of the Crown. 
    Neither of those situations apply here. He’s the victim, his daughter is the 
    victim.</p>
  <p>.  . . </p>
  <p>The Court: I don’t necessarily understand why I should give an unsavoury 
    witness direction with respect to the victim of the crime. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [41]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    I take a different view of the law. I believe Dickson J.’s judgment in <i>Vetrovec</i> 
    itself  indicates that no category of witness is exempt from being the subject 
    of a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning. Although giving a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning for 
    the evidence of a complainant or a victim is perhaps unusual, the principles 
    that underlie the warning do not distinguish between complainants or victims 
    and other witnesses. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [42]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    In the Supreme Court of Canada’s most recent <i>Vetrovec</i> case, <i>Brooks</i>, 
    <i>supra</i>, Major J. pointed out at para. 80 that whether a <i>Vetrovec</i> 
    warning is needed turns on the interplay of two factors: the importance of 
    the witness’s evidence to the Crown’s case and the witness’s credibility:</p>
  <p>In summary, two main factors are relevant when deciding whether a <i>Vetrovec</i> 
    warning is necessary: the witness’s credibility, and the importance of the 
    witness’s testimony to the Crown’s case. No specific threshold need be met 
    on either factor before a warning becomes necessary. Instead, where the witness 
    is absolutely essential to the Crown’s case, more moderate credibility problems 
    will warrant a warning. Where the witness has overwhelming credibility problems, 
    a warning may be necessary even if the Crown’s case is a strong one without 
    the witness’s evidence. In short, the factors should not be looked to independently 
    of one another but in combination.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [43]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    If the trial judge had applied the analysis suggested by Major J. in <i>Brooks</i>, 
    he should have concluded that a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning for the evidence of 
    Blackstock was necessary. Although in many cases a trial judge has broad discretion 
    whether or not to give a warning, this, in my view, is one of those cases 
    where a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning was mandatory. It was mandatory because Blackstock’s 
    evidence was critical to the Crown’s case, and yet he was a most unsavoury 
    witness. Thus the failure to give the warning amounts to an error in law. 
    I will briefly elaborate on why I consider that the warning was mandatory. 
  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(a)       <u>The importance of Blackstock’s evidence 
    to the Crown’s case</u></h4>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [44]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    No physical or forensic evidence linked the appellant to the shooting. The 
    crucial evidence against him was Blackstock’s identification evidence. I agree 
    with Mr. Lockyer’s submission that apart from Blackstock’s evidence, the Crown’s 
    case rested on circumstantial evidence, which, standing alone, was likely 
    insufficient to make out even a <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> case against the 
    appellant. Even if I were to accept the Crown’s contention that overall its 
    case against the appellant was very strong, the Crown still acknowledges that 
    the centerpiece of its case was Blackstock’s identification of the appellant 
    as the shooter. Thus, on either side’s view of the case, Blackstock’s evidence 
    was essential to the prosecution. Indeed, during a discussion with counsel, 
    the trial judge remarked that, “it would be inconceivable to think of a scenario 
    where the Crown could obtain a conviction unless the jury believed the testimony 
    of Mr. Blackstock.” </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(b)             <u>Blackstock’s credibility</u></h4>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [45]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    During his dialogue with counsel, the trial judge commented that Blackstock 
    “isn’t unsavoury. . . . he doesn’t have, really, what you would call an unsavoury 
    criminal record.” In my view, the trial judge’s assessment of Blackstock’s 
    credibility was unreasonable. On my reading of the transcript, Blackstock’s 
    criminal record was but one of numerous and compelling reasons to be very 
    wary of trusting his evidence.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [46]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    First, Blackstock’s June 15 statement to the police, his June 21 statement 
    to the police, and his trial testimony differed materially from each other 
    on four crucial points: whether Blackstock could identify the appellant as 
    the shooter, the number of his assailants, whether Blackstock was inside or 
    outside of the car when he was shot, and whether the shooter’s face was covered. 
    The following chart summarizes these material inconsistencies in Blackstock’s 
    account:</p>

    Second, on the crucial issue of motive, Blackstock directly contradicted the 
    Crown’s theory. In neither his pretrial statements to the police nor in his 
    trial testimony did Blackstock acknowledge that at The Palisades the night 
    before the shooting he had pulled out a gun and pistol-whipped the appellant. 
    In his June 21 statement to the police Blackstock told the interviewing officer 
    that he could not even remember whether the appellant had been at The Palisades. 
    When cross-examined at trial about why he would lie to police, he first claimed 
    he didn’t know and then said, “You know, really, them days you know what, 
    I was saving everything for the courts . . . . I figure if I said yeah there 
    was an argument and that I might have got a charge for something ‘cause I 
    don’t have no luck.”</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [48]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Third, Blackstock had a criminal record, and it was not a minor record. As 
    a youth he was convicted of four counts of robbery. As an adult his record 
    showed two convictions for assault, a conviction for mischief, and most importantly, 
    a 1993 conviction for manslaughter. His manslaughter conviction arose from 
    the 1991 shooting death of Dwight Kelly. Initially Blackstock and a man named 
    Ferrier were charged with first-degree murder. Ferrier fired the fatal shots. 
    Blackstock pleaded guilty to manslaughter. At his guilty plea, he admitted 
    that he was armed with a gun, which he had brandished on hearing the shots 
    being fired. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment in addition to eighteen 
    months pretrial custody.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [49]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Fourth, Blackstock’s evidence concerning his manslaughter conviction shows 
    that he has no hesitation in lying when he thinks to do so is advantageous. 
    Despite having agreed to the facts read at his guilty plea, at the appellant’s 
    trial Blackstock maintained that he had not been carrying a gun. When confronted 
    with the contradiction, Blackstock testified that he had lied to his own lawyers 
    about having a gun. He was then reminded that while serving his sentence for 
    his manslaughter conviction he had told the corrections authorities he was 
    carrying a gun the night Kelly was killed and indeed, always carried a gun 
    when he went to certain areas. However, Blackstock testified at the appellant’s 
    trial that he had lied to the corrections authorities because he figured he 
    needed to “tell them what they want to hear” to obtain early parole. In short, 
    he either lied to his lawyers and the corrections authorities and knowingly 
    permitted his lawyers to mislead the court, or he lied under oath at the appellant’s 
    trial. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [50]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    In the light of Blackstock’s evidence concerning his manslaughter conviction 
    and his refusal to acknowledge that he had pistol-whipped the appellant, which 
    was the central underpinning of the Crown’s case, it is hardly surprising 
    that in closing argument the Crown told the jury, “I must say to you it’s 
    also very clear that Warren Blackstock has a motive to lie when the truth 
    might incriminate him. In fact he admits as much”; and, “Warren Blackstock 
    isn’t going to tell the truth when his doing so will put him in jail.”</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [51]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Fifth, at the time of the shooting, Blackstock was facing outstanding charges 
    of assault with a weapon and uttering threats, and two counts of failing to 
    comply with his recognizance. The assault with a weapon charge related to 
    an incident in February 1999. Blackstock allegedly got into an argument with 
    three men and brandished a handgun at one of them. In cross-examination, Blackstock 
    denied the allegation.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [52]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The uttering threats charge concerned telephone calls to the mother of two 
    of his children in the period of January-June 1995, while he was on mandatory 
    supervision for his manslaughter conviction. He allegedly made twenty-two 
    calls to the woman, threatened to shoot her in the head, and said, “a pussy 
    like you deserves to be dead.” Blackstock denied the allegations. He claimed 
    that the woman telephoned the police to have him returned to the penitentiary.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [53]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Blackstock admitted that he had violated several conditions of his recognizance 
    for his assault with a weapon charge. These included the conditions that he 
    not associate with anyone he knew had a criminal record, that he live with 
    his surety, and that he obey a curfew. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [54]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Sixth, other evidence suggested Blackstock was a drug dealer and led a dubious 
    lifestyle. At trial, he denied that he was a drug dealer, even though in his 
    June 21 statement he acknowledged to the police that he was involved with 
    drugs and “was dealing with good stuff.” He also denied that he had ever used 
    cocaine even though his urine samples taken the day after the shooting revealed 
    traces of cocaine metabolite. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [55]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Blackstock admitted that he never filed an income tax return and that he kept 
    large sums of cash “stashed away.” Shortly before the shooting, he and a friend, 
    an admitted drug dealer, wire transferred $9,000 to Jamaica. Blackstock claimed 
    that the money had been sent to buy music for his disc jockey business. On 
    the day before the shooting, on his way to Wasaga Beach, he stopped to visit 
    two strippers. One of the women gave him money, but he denied that it was 
    for drugs. Blackstock also denied knowing about the rumours Gardness was spreading, 
    accusing him of selling drugs. But he did agree his problems with Gardness 
    were so serious “word on the street” was that Blackstock was dead. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [56]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    These six considerations show that Blackstock was an unsavoury and untrustworthy 
    witness. He had no regard for telling the truth, no regard for the law, and 
    no regard for the judicial system. Yet his evidence was crucial to the Crown’s 
    case. The jury ought to have been warned about his evidence.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [57]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The Crown seeks to defend the trial judge’s refusal to give a warning as a 
    valid exercise of his discretion. The Crown makes three points. First, it 
    submits that a warning was not required because the untrustworthiness of the 
    witness’s evidence would have been apparent to the jury. Second, though a 
    <i>Vetrovec</i> warning may be required in cases where there is a risk that 
    the witness is testifying in order to curry favour with the authorities, here 
    there is no evidence that Blackstock was attempting to do so in connection 
    with his outstanding charges.  Third, the Crown submits that Blackstock had 
    no motive to falsely accuse the appellant of killing his three-year-old daughter. 
  </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [58]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    I do not accept the Crown’s submissions. That Blackstock’s untrustworthiness 
    would have been apparent to the jury does not do away with the need for a 
    warning. The same point about an unsavoury witness could be made in virtually 
    every case where a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning is required. The considerations 
    that determine whether a warning is needed concern the witness’s credibility 
    and the importance of the witness’s evidence to the prosecution’s case. Indeed, 
    often a warning will be most needed where the problems with the witness’s 
    credibility are most obvious. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [59]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Nor do I accept that the absence of any evidence showing Blackstock was currying 
    favour with the authorities does away with the need for a warning. No one 
    consideration is decisive of whether a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning must be given: 
    see <i>Brooks</i> at para. 79. Instead, the question is whether on a common 
    sense assessment there are considerations that should lead a court to suspect 
    the witness’s credibility. The considerations that I have listed above show 
    that Blackstock’s evidence should be approached cautiously. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [60]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Finally, I think it is speculative to accept the Crown’s contention that when 
    Blackstock identified the appellant he had no motive to lie. He might well 
    have had a motive to lie that would not be readily apparent to the jury. For 
    example, it is just as plausible that Blackstock’s first statement to the 
    police was truthful, and that when he later identified the appellant he was 
    lying in order to give the authorities the evidence that they lacked. I do 
    not consider it at all clear that the jurors’ experience and common sense 
    would enable them to assess Blackstock’s motives when he testified at the 
    trial.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [61]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    In refusing to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning for Blackstock’s evidence, the 
    trial judge erred in two ways. He erred in principle in refusing to give a 
    warning on the ground that Blackstock was a victim. And he erred by making 
    an unreasonable assessment of Blackstock’s credibility. I conclude that a 
    <i>Vetrovec</i> warning for the evidence of Blackstock was mandatory. The 
    failure to give it amounted to an error of law. The remaining question is 
    whether the Crown can rely on the curative proviso by showing that the lack 
    of a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning caused no substantial wrong.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(c)             <u>Application of the proviso 
    in section 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Code?</i></u></h4>
  <p style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'> [62]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Section 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Code</i> may be applied to cure the absence 
    of a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning: see <i>Brooks, supra,</i> and <i>R. v. Armstrong 
    </i>(2003),<i> </i>179 C.C.C. (3d) 37 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. 
    refused, [2003] S.C.C.A. No. 554. The Crown bears the burden of showing that 
    if the trial judge had properly warned the jury of the danger of relying on 
    Blackstock’s evidence without confirmation, the jury’s verdict would necessarily 
    have been the same. Or, as Major J. stated in <i>R. v. Bevan</i>, [1993] 2 
    S.C.R. 599 at para. 42, if “there is any reasonable possibility that the verdict 
    would have been different had the error at issue not been made,” the court 
    should not apply the proviso. I do not think that the Crown can meet its burden. 
    I have come to that conclusion for the following reasons. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [63]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    First, Blackstock’s identification evidence was crucial to the Crown’s case 
    and the failure to warn the jury about his evidence was a serious error. Without 
    Blackstock’s evidence, the Crown’s case against the appellant was not overwhelming. 
    The other evidence on which the Crown relied – circumstantial evidence of 
    the appellant’s opportunity, motive, and post-offence conduct and the alleged 
    Titus statements – was not sufficient to sustain the conviction. This much 
    the Crown acknowledges. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [64]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Second, unlike in <i>Armstrong</i>, the trial judge in this case did not caution 
    the jury in words that approximated or came close to a proper <i>Vetrovec</i> 
    warning. In <i>Armstrong</i>, at 40, the trial judge told the jury that it 
    should approach the evidence of the suspect witness “with care and caution.” 
    He then gave a standard instruction on the use of the witness’s criminal record 
    and he exhaustively reviewed the inconsistencies in the witness’s testimony. 
    These aspects of the charge prompted Rosenberg J.A. at para. 32 to conclude 
    that although the trial judge did not give a proper <i>Vetrovec</i> warning, 
    he did “go a long way to alerting the jury to the fact that [the witness] 
    occupied a special place in the trial and why his evidence had to be approached 
    with caution.”</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [65]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    In this case, the trial judge did not similarly caution the jury. He did give 
    the jury a standard instruction on using Blackstock’s criminal record to assess 
    his credibility and an instruction on how Blackstock’s inconsistent statements 
    to the police “may or may not undermine his credibility.” But he did not clearly 
    warn the jury of the need to approach Blackstock’s evidence cautiously, or 
    of the need to be wary of accepting that evidence. Perhaps the closest the 
    trial judge came to doing so was in his instructions on identification. After 
    telling the jury about the general frailties of identification evidence he 
    did point out that “there are serious weaknesses in Warren Blackstock’s identification 
    of the accused” as the shooter. But this caution was directed to the reliability 
    of Blackstock’s identification evidence. <i>Vetrovec</i> is a warning directed 
    to the credibility of the witness’s evidence.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [66]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    This distinction is important here.  Reliability goes to the accuracy of the 
    witness’s testimony; credibility goes to its truthfulness. If warned only 
    about reliability, the jury may be left with the impression that it should 
    consider the witness’s conflicting accounts and then weigh each account to 
    determine the one it feels was most accurate. In contrast, a warning about 
    credibility puts all of a witness’s testimony in doubt: see <i>R. v. Mezzo</i>, 
    [1986] 1 S.C.R. 802 at para. 78.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [67]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Third, nowhere in his charge did the trial judge catalogue for the jury the 
    numerous considerations that would trigger concern about Blackstock’s trustworthiness. 
    Instead, several aspects of the trial judge’s charge may well have had the 
    opposite effect of partially rehabilitating Blackstock’s credibility in the 
    eyes of the jury.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [68]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    For example, the trial judge downplayed the seriousness of Blackstock’s conviction 
    for manslaughter. During the defence’s cross-examination of Blackstock, the 
    trial judge had twice said, “the fact he had a gun is irrelevant.” Then in 
    his charge the trial judge told the jury: </p>
  <p>[I]n January of 1993 he was convicted of manslaughter. That did not involve 
    him shooting anybody. He was a secondary party to it. He was given two years 
    in the penitentiary. It is the lowest sentence you can get in the penitentiary.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [69]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    From these comments the jury may have thought Blackstock’s manslaughter conviction 
    was of little significance to his credibility. Yet Blackstock received a two-year 
    sentence in addition to eighteen months of pretrial custody, which effectively 
    meant that he received a five-year sentence. Moreover, through his lawyer, 
    Blackstock admitted to the court that he was brandishing a gun when Kelly 
    was shot, an admission he then disavowed at the appellant’s trial. The manslaughter 
    was a serious offence and Blackstock’s contradictory accounts about whether 
    he had a gun were significant to his credibility. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [70]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Also, the trial judge did give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning for the evidence 
    of Kwami Mingo. The contrast between the warning for Mingo’s testimony and 
    the absence of a warning for Blackstock’s evidence could not have escaped 
    the jury’s consideration. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [71]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Further, the trial judge, in effect, made excuses for Blackstock’s failure 
    to identify the shooter in his June 15 statement to the police.  The trial 
    judge repeatedly reminded the jury that Blackstock was in intensive care at 
    the time, and speculated that Blackstock likely did not then know he was permanently 
    paralysed and “consequently, he may not have wanted to tell the police the 
    whole truth at that time.” The record, however, does not suggest that either 
    Blackstock’s physical disability or the medication he was taking impaired 
    his coherence, or his ability to communicate when he gave his statement to 
    the police – as he was entitled to do.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [72]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Fourth, in cases where a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning is given, the trial judge 
    still retains the discretion to list the evidence capable of supporting the 
    witness’s testimony even though the effect of doing so may be to neutralize 
    the impact of the warning. In this case, although the trial judge did not 
    give a warning, he listed for the jury – as he was entitled to do – the five 
    pieces of evidence relied on by the Crown to support Blackstock’s identification 
    of the appellant: the appellant had motive; the appellant had the opportunity 
    to commit the crime and he did not call an alibi witness; the killer ran out 
    of the same housing complex from which the appellant emerged minutes later; 
    Blackstock named the appellant as his shooter within fifteen minutes of the 
    shooting; and the appellant went into hiding when he learned from his sister 
    that Blackstock had survived. Thus the appellant did not have the benefit 
    of a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning, and yet he still had put against him the evidence 
    capable of confirming Blackstock’s testimony. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [73]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Undoubtedly, there was evidence apart from the testimony of Blackstock that 
    implicated the appellant. However, for the reasons that I have set out above, 
    I cannot conclude that the verdict would have necessarily been the same if 
    a proper <i>Vetrovec</i> warning had been given. Therefore, this is not an 
    appropriate case for the application of the curative proviso in 686(i)(b)(iii) 
    of the <i>Code</i>. On this ground alone, I would set aside the appellant’s 
    convictions and order a new trial.  </p>
  <h3>D. Conclusion</h3>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [74]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The failure to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning for Blackstock’s evidence was 
    a serious error in law, which cannot be cured by the application of the proviso 
    in section 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. Thus the appellant 
    was deprived of a fair trial on a first-degree murder charge.  I would allow 
    the appeal, set aside the convictions, and order a new trial. </p>
