'> [1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>The 
    appellant R.B. and his wife ran a foster home for adolescent boys. Four boys 
    in their care alleged that the appellant had sexually abused them. The sexual 
    abuse included genital fondling, masturbation, and for two of the boys, anal 
    intercourse. The alleged abuse took place between 1983 and 1991, when the 
    complainants were twelve to eighteen years old. The allegations were first 
    reported to the police in 1999.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>In 
    April 2002, the appellant was tried on a ten-count indictment before Lederman 
    J. and a jury. Each of the four complainants gave evidence. The appellant 
    testified and denied the allegations against him. His wife testified in his 
    defence, as did several character witnesses. Nonetheless, the jury found the 
    appellant guilty on all ten counts. The trial judge sentenced him to ten years 
    in the penitentiary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>The 
    appellant appeals both his convictions and his sentence. The two main issues 
    on the conviction appeal are whether the trial judge erred in admitting the 
    evidence of each complainant as similar fact evidence, and , if properly admitted, 
    whether he erred in instructing the jury on how this evidence could be used. 
    The main issue on the sentence appeal is whether the trial judge properly 
    applied this courts decision in <i>R. v. D.(D.)</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 
    471.</p>
  <h3 style='text-align:justify'><span style='text-transform:uppercase;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Each of 
    the four complainants  D.T, C.W., T.B., and O.C.  came to the appellants 
    foster home from a troubled family upbringing. Each had previously been in 
    the care of the Childrens Aid Society. Each came to view the appellant as 
    a father figure. Apart from the sexual abuse, each complainant described living 
    at the foster home in positive terms. Life there was wonderful, the appellant 
    was a good person, and he and his wife gave the complainants the family 
    they had never had before. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In each 
    case, the alleged abuse began when a complainant was particularly vulnerable 
     because of injury, illness or inebriation. In each case the abuse began 
    with fondling. In respect of C.W. and O. C., the abuse escalated to repeated 
    acts of anal sex. In respect of D.T. and T.B., the abuse consisted of genital 
    touching, and oral sex, and occurred mainly after each boy had left the foster 
    home. There was no evidence led at trial that the complainants colluded with 
    each other, or even discussed the appellants misconduct with each other. 
    The following is a brief synopsis of each complainants evidence:</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;'><u><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>i. 
    D.T.</span></u></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>D.T. moved into the foster home when he was 
    sixteen years old. He stayed there six months, and then went to live with 
    his mother. No abuse occurred during this period. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>However, when he was seventeen, D.T. got into 
    a fight with his sister for which he was charged criminally. He was released 
    on bail. The appellant acted as his surety. The terms of D.T.s bail required 
    him to live at the appellants foster home. He stayed eight months. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>One evening after school, D.T. told the appellant 
    that he suffered a hamstring or groin pull from running. The appellant offered 
    to give him a massage. He rubbed D.T.s leg for five minutes and then moved 
    his hands closer to D.T.s genitals. D.T. ended the massage and went to his 
    room. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>On another occasion, D.T. and the appellant 
    were on the balcony of the foster home. The appellant grabbed D.T.s genitals. 
    D.T. kept telling the appellant to stop. Eventually D.T. broke free. He stayed 
    at the foster home for another four or five months. While he was there, no 
    further acts of sexual impropriety took place.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>After D.T. left the foster home he kept in touch 
    with the appellant. Despite the incidents of abuse, D.T. regarded the appellant 
    as a good person who had helped him a lot. Occasionally, they went driving 
    together so they had a chance to talk. Three or four times, the appellant 
    put his hand on D.T.s thigh, moved it up and down, and tried to touch his 
    genitals. After these incidents, D.T. ended all contact with the appellant. 
    He did not want the appellant to touch him any more. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>ii. C.W.</span></u></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>C.W. came to 
    live at the appellants foster home when he was twelve years old. The first 
    incident of sexual abuse he described occurred when he was sick with a fever. 
    The appellant put him in a shower to make him sweat out his illness. The 
    appellant washed his groin area in a way that seemed inappropriate to C.W. 
    Later that night, C.W. woke up in his bed to find the appellants hand under 
    his clothes touching, fondling and massaging his groin. The appellant kept 
    doing so until C.W. got an erection.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>A month or two 
    later the appellants conduct escalated significantly. He forced C.W. to have 
    anal sex. C.W. was unsure how often, but said that it happened more than five 
    or six times. The appellant tried to reassure C.W. by telling him that he 
    was a special person and that anal sex was normal. When he was sixteen or 
    seventeen, C.W. moved out of the foster home. However, the appellant found 
    him and the sexual activity continued.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>iii. T.B.</span></u></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>T.B. went to 
    live at the foster home when he was thirteen or fourteen. He stayed six months 
    to a year. Nothing improper occurred while he lived with the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>However, T.B 
    testified about one incident of sexual abuse, which occurred a few months 
    after<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>he left the foster home. T.B. 
    had been out late, past midnight, drinking with some friends. He could have 
    gone to his grandmothers house, but it was late and he did not want to wake 
    her, so he went to the appellants residence. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>The appellant 
    answered the door in his bathrobe. T.B.told him that he had been drinking, 
    and asked if he could come in and go to sleep. He lay down on the couch with 
    his head on the appellants lap. The appellant rubbed T.B.s leg and his stomach, 
    undid his belt and pants, and continued to rub his stomach. Then the appellant 
    put his hands on T.B.s penis and began rubbing it. Finally the appellant 
    took out his own penis, held T.B.s head to it and moved T.B.s head up and 
    down. The appellants penis became erect but he did not ejaculate. The incident 
    lasted five to ten minutes. After a while, the appellant got up and went away. 
    T.B. left the appellants residence early in the morning and never returned.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><u><span style='font-size:

    in the appellants foster home when he was eleven or twelve years old. He 
    had been living there about one year when one day he got a cold. The appellant 
    suggested a hot shower to sweat out the cold. The heat made O.C. dizzy, and 
    the appellant helped him to bed. O.C. was lying naked under the sheets. The 
    appellant started playing with O.C.s penis until he ejaculated. The appellant 
    cleaned it up and then left. O.C. told some other boys in the residence what 
    had happened but they did not believe him.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>A few months 
    after this first incident, the appellants sexual abuse of O.C. became more 
    frequent and more serious. It progressed to masturbation, to O.C. performing 
    oral sex on the appellant, and finally to anal sex. The appellant always initiated 
    the sexual activity.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>O.C. stayed at

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In his oral 
    argument, counsel for the appellant advanced four grounds of appeal against 
    conviction: the trial judges ruling on the similar fact evidence; his instruction 
    to the jury on how to use that evidence; and two grounds on which we did not 
    call on the Crown  whether the trial judge properly instructed the jury on 
    the evidence of the appellants good character, and whether the trial judge 
    properly instructed the jury on the complainants delayed reporting of their 
    allegations of sexual abuse. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>First issue: did the trial judge 
    err in admitting the evidence of each complainant as similar fact evidence? 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> At the beginning 
    of the trial, the defence brought a motion for severance so that the charges 
    relating to each complainant would be tried separately. The Crown brought 
    a motion to have the evidence of each complainant admitted as similar fact 
    evidence on the counts relating to the other complainants. The trial judge 
    dismissed the defences motion and granted the Crowns motion. The appellant 
    does not appeal the ruling denying severance. He does, however, appeal the 
    similar fact ruling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellant 
    attacks the trial judges similar fact ruling on two grounds. First, he argues 
    that the trial judge erred in holding that the similar fact evidence was relevant 
    to each complainants credibility because that invited admitting the evidence 
    merely for proof of general disposition. Second, he argues that the trial 
    judge ought to have distinguished between the evidence of C.W. and O.C. on 
    the one hand, and the evidence of D.T. and T. B. on the other. The sexual 
    assaults on C.W. and O.C. included anal intercourse and were more serious 
    than the assaults on D.T. and T.B.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The appellant acknowledges that the evidence 
    of C.W. is admissible as similar fact evidence on the counts relating to O.C. 
    and <i>vice versa</i>. He argues, however, that the prejudicial effect of 
    admitting the evidence of C.W. and O.C. on the counts relating to D.T. and 
    T.B. outweighs its probative value and should not have been permitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In the Supreme 
    Court of Canadas leading similar fact decision, <i>R. v. Handy</i> (2002), 
    164 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 522, Binnie J. affirmed that a trial judges decision 
    to admit similar fact evidence is entitled to substantial deference. But 
    he also stated that [a] trial judge has no discretion to admit similar fact 
    evidence whose prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. I would 
    defer to the trial judges ruling. I am not persuaded that he erred in concluding 
    that the probative value of the evidence of each complainant<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>on the other counts in the indictment outweighed its prejudicial effect. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellants first argument concerns whether the trial judge properly 
    identified the issue for which the similar fact evidence was relevant. The 
    trial judges similar fact ruling was given in early April 2002, and therefore 
    he did not have the benefit of the Supreme Courts decision in <i>Handy</i>, 
    which was released in late June 2002. As in many pre-<i>Handy</i> similar 
    fact rulings, the trial judge held that this evidence could be used to enhance 
    each complainants credibility. In <i>Handy</i>, at pages 514-15, however, 
    Binnie J. cautioned that [I]dentification of credibility as the issue in 
    question may, unless circumscribed, risk the admission of evidence of nothing 
    more than general disposition (bad personhood). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I do not think that was a risk here. The trial judges ruling showed 
    that he admitted the similar fact evidence not to show a general propensity 
    to engage in sexual misconduct but to show the appellants specific propensity 
    to engage in sexual misconduct with boys in his care who came to him in a 
    vulnerable condition. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, the evidence has significant probative 
    value beyond mere propensity of the accused to engage in a particular type 
    of conduct or to show a general criminal disposition to commit this type of 
    crime. The similar fact evidence would be tendered to infer the accuseds 
    disposition to engage in sexual activity with boys with whom he has had or 
    continues to have a father relationship which is initiated at a time when 
    the boy is in a vulnerable condition and under the guise of trying to assist 
    him. From that, it is open for a trier of fact to infer that the accused acted 
    in conformity with such disposition to commit the subject offence. It is through 
    these inferences that the evidence may be capable of corroborating each complainants 
    story and thereby enhancing their credibility and establishing design or rebutting 
    any defences such, as innocent association, that may be raised by the accused. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none'>The question 
    to be decided was whether the sexual assaults occurred. The similar fact evidence 
    was probative of the <i>actus reus</i> of the offences, which in turn depended 
    on the credibility of the complainants evidence about the assaults, See <i>R. 
    v. T.C.</i> , (11 January 2005), Ontario C39114 (Ont.C.A.) at para. 56.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I turn to the appellants second argument, whether in his ruling the 
    trial judge should have distinguished between the evidence of C.W. and O.C., 
    and the evidence of D.T. and T.B. The appellant accepts that there is sufficient 
    connectedness between the evidence of C.W. and O.C. to make eachs admissible 
    as similar fact evidence on the counts relating to the other. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellants concerns are first that there is not the same level 
    of connectedness between the evidence of C.W. and O.C. and the evidence of 
    D.T. and C.B.; and second that the prejudicial effect of using the evidence 
    of C.W. and O.C. on the counts pertaining to D.T. and T.B. is very high. The 
    appellant points out that the assaults on D.T. and T.B. were less serious 
    and that, unlike the assaults on C.W. and O.C., they occurred mainly after 
    these two boys had left the foster home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I do not agree with the appellants position. In my view, although 
    the assaults on D.T. and T.B. did not escalate to anal intercourse, as they 
    did with C.W. and O.C., there remained a high degree of connectedness (<i>Handy, 
    supra,</i> at 505) or, to use the trial judges word, similarity among all 
    the acts in question. The trial judge dealt with these similarities in his 
    ruling. As I largely agree with his analysis I will review the similarities 
    briefly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In each case the appellant first engaged in sexually abusive conduct 
    when the complainant was especially vulnerable, be it from injury, illness 
    or inebriation; in each case he engaged in his first act of sexual abuse under 
    the guise of assisting the complainant; in each case the appellants first 
    sexual assault amounted to genital fondling; in each case the sexual assaults 
    began in the appellants home; in each case the complainant came to view the 
    appellant as a father figure. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> These considerations show a high degree of connectedness. The number 
    of complaints and the absence of any material gap in time when the appellant 
    was not allegedly engaged in this abusive conduct adds to the connectedness. 
    That the assaults on D.T. and T.B. occurred after they had left the appellants 
    home is not a difference that materially diminishes the level of connectedness. 
    The appellant was able to commit these offences on D.T. and T.B. because he 
    had developed a relationship of trust with each of them while each was under 
    his care at the home. For example, T.B. went to the foster home when inebriated 
    because he knew from his previous experience there that the appellant would 
    be home and would care for him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I accept that the potential prejudicial effect of using the evidence 
    of C.W. and O.C. on the counts relating to T.B. and especially to D.T. is 
    a concern. The acts of anal intercourse were somewhat more serious than the 
    assault on T.B. and considerably more serious than the assaults on D.T.. These 
    acts could arouse in the jury sentiments of revulsion and condemnation that 
    might arguably risk a fair trial for the appellant on the charges relating 
    to D.T. and T.B. (See <i>R. v. Thomas</i> (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 31 (Ont. 
    C.A.) at paras. 35-36.) Balanced against this potential prejudicial effect, 
    however, is the strong probative value of this evidence both because of its 
    high degree of connectedness and, as the trial judge found, because of the 
    absence of collusion among the complainants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge was aware of the possible prejudicial effect of admitting 
    the evidence of each complainant as similar fact evidence on the other counts. 
    He undertook the balancing exercise that the law requires. I cannot say he 
    was wrong in concluding that the probative value of the evidence outweighed 
    its prejudicial effect. I would therefore not give effect to this ground of 
    appeal. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText style='text-align:justify'>Second issue: Did the trial 
    judge err in instructing the jury on how to use the similar fact evidence?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant also challenges the trial judges jury instruction on 
    the use of the similar fact evidence. The appellant contends that the trial 
    judge erred by failing to explain to the jury how a pattern of similar behavior 
    supported the credibility of each complainants allegations. The absence of 
    such an instruction, according to the appellant, would have caused the jury 
    to convict the appellant by reasoning improperly that he had a general propensity 
    to commit the crimes. The appellant complains about the following two passages 
    in the trial judges charge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, you may but do not have to find that there 
    is a pattern of similar behaviour that confirms each complainants testimony 
    that the offences took place. It is for you to say.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In considering this evidence, bear in mind the relationship 
    between Mr. Burke and the complainants as well as the circumstances of each 
    of the situations. In deciding whether such a pattern of similar behavior 
    exists, you should consider the similarities and differences of each of the 
    circumstances pertaining to each of the complainants.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>and, </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is for you to decide whether there are sufficient 
    similar features to the context of each of the allegations such that they 
    would enhance the credibility of each complainant. If you are not satisfied 
    that the evidence demonstrates a pattern of similar behavior, then evidence 
    on each count must be considered without regard to the evidence of the other 
    complainants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I do not accept the appellants contention. Indeed the trial judge 
    began his instruction on similar fact evidence by cautioning the jury in words 
    that answer the appellants concern. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Each count requires its own proof. The real issue 
    for you to decide in this case is whether the offences alleged by each complainant 
    or any of them ever actually took place. Be careful not to jump to the conclusion 
    that if you believe that one complainant is telling the truth, the others 
    must be telling the truth as well. Nor should you jump to the conclusion that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>because the complainants allege similar conduct they all must have 
    occurred if any one of them is proved. It is up to the Crown to prove each 
    charge independently of the others. I caution you that you are not to use 
    the evidence on one count to generally infer that Mr. Burke is of such a bad 
    character or disposition that he is likely to have committed the offences 
    charged in any of the other counts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In other words, the trial judge warned the jury not to use general 
    propensity reasoning to convict the appellant. The balance of the trial judges 
    charge on similar fact evidence steered the jury toward how it might properly 
    use this evidence. He told the jury it could, but need not find that the evidence 
    disclosed a pattern of similar behavior, which would confirm each complainants 
    testimony about the allegations. He instructed the jury that in deciding whether 
    a pattern existed it should consider both the similarities and the differences 
    in the circumstances pertaining to each complainant, which he then outlined. 
    He specifically described the pattern alleged by the Crown.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown submits that there is such a pattern of 
    similar behaviour in the way Mr. Burke acted towards each complainant that 
    would support the credibility of the particular allegation of the other complainants, 
    namely, first, that he would wait to initiate sexual touching until a time 
    when each of the complainants was ill or incapacitated in some way. O.C. and 
    C.W. were ill with colds. D.T. had an injured leg. T.B. was in an intoxicated 
    condition. Secondly, that Mr. Burke would engage in the first incident of 
    sexual abuse under the guise of trying to help or assist the complainant in 
    some fashion. And thirdly, that the first incident of sexual abuse on each 
    of the complainants began with limited sexual conduct such as the touching 
    of the genital area.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge cautioned the jury on the need for sufficient similar 
    features to use each complainants evidence to enhance the credibility of 
    the other complainants. And finally he cautioned the jury that, regardless 
    of its finding on whether a pattern of similar behavior existed, it could 
    convict the appellant of an offence only if the Crown had met its burden on 
    all elements of that offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In the light of these instructions, I am not persuaded that there 
    existed any real risk that the jury would have used the similar fact evidence 
    improperly, that is to convict because of the appellants general bad disposition 
    (<i>Thomas, supra</i>, at paras 38-44). Defence counsel apparently did not 
    think so either for he neither sought an additional instruction during the 
    pre-charge conference nor objected to this portion of the charge once it had 
    been given. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>

    </span> The appellant also submitted that the trial judge failed to instruct 
    the jury properly on the use of good character evidence and on the complainants 
    delay in reporting the sexual abuse. We found no merit in these submissions 
    and did not call on the Crown to respond to them. </p>

    the defence to draw the inference that [the appellant] is not the type of

    evidence is not so diminished. I am not persuaded that this instruction was 
    called for. Defence counsel did not ask for it. There were no credibility

    </span> In his forceful reasons in <i>D.(D.), </i>Moldaver J.A. suggested 
    these sentencing ranges in cases where adults in a position of trust sexually 
    abuse young children: where the abuse is regular and persistent and occurs 
    over a substantial period of time, a mid to upper single digit penitentiary 
    term; where the sexual abuse includes full intercourse and is accompanied 
    by other physical violence, threats of physical violence or extortion, an 
    upper single digit to low double digit penitentiary term; and where these 
    elements are accompanied by severe psychological, emotional and physical brutality, 
    an even higher penitentiary term (<i>D.(D.), supra</i>, at pp. 480-481, 484). 
    Moldaver J.A. properly recognized that, in sentencing adults who sexually 
    abuse children, denunciation, general and specific deterrence, and the need 
    to separate offenders from society should take precedence over the other recognized 
    objectives of sentencing. In <i>D.(D.)</i> itself this court upheld an effective

    </span></span> The trial judge gave thorough and careful reasons for sentence. 
    He canvassed the mitigating and aggravating considerations bearing on a fit 
    sentence. He identified the principal aggravating consideration that called 
    for a lengthy penitentiary sentence: the appellant exploited his position 
    of trust and authority to prey on these vulnerable boys, and as a result irretrievably 
    damaged them. That said, while I agree that the appellants misconduct justified 
    a severe sentence, I agree with his submission that it warranted a lesser 
    sentence than that imposed in <i>D.(D.)</i> or by the trial judge in this 
    case. Although the appellants sexual abuse was similar to that of the accused 
    in <i>D.(D.)</i>, it was not accompanied by the numerous aggravating factors 
    present in <i>D.(D.).</i></p>

    </span> The following considerations suggest that the appropriate <i>D.(D.)</i> 
    range is a mid to upper single digit penitentiary term, not the range applied 
    by the trial judge, an upper single digit to low double digit pentitentiary 
    term.</p>

13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>Most important, 
    the accused in <i>D.(D.)</i> used violence during sex and threatened his victims 
    to keep them silent. For example, he dangled a child over a balcony thirty 
    stories high because he feared that the child might report him. He also extorted 
    his victims with pictures. </span></p>

    did not engage in any similar conduct. He did not use physical violence, threats

    term. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:

    </i>and this case there were four victims. Both the accused in <i>D.(D.)</i> 
    and the appellant abused positions of trust, and the appellants breach was 
    particularly serious because he took advantage of adolescent youths who were 
    looking for a safe haven from their troubled upbringing. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormalIndent style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:

    </span> At the time of trial the appellant was fifty seven years old. He and 
    his wife had been foster parents for nearly twenty years. He had a strong 
    marriage of twenty seven years. He was a leader in his church. He had a sterling 
    reputation in the community. And he did considerable volunteer work for which 
    he received numerous awards. Taking into account these mitigating considerations, 
    together with the features that I have outlined distinguishing this case from 
    <i>D.(D.)</i>, I consider a fit sentence is seven and a half years in the 
    penitentiary.</p>

    </span> I would dismiss the conviction appeal. In my view the trial judge 
    did not err in admitting the evidence of each complainant as similar fact 
    evidence, and he did not err in his instruction to the jury on how to use 
    that evidence. </p>

    </span> I would, however, grant leave to appeal sentence, and reduce the appellants 
    global sentence from ten years to seven and a half years in the penitentiary. 
    I would give effect to this sentence by reducing the sentences on count one 
    (sexual assault on O.C.) and count six (sexual assault on C.W.) from four 
    years to three years, and the sentence on count three (sexual assault on D.T.) 
    from one year to six months.</p>
