    by Carosi and consider any information those references gave concerning Carosi’s 
    prior work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Counsel also acknowledges, 
    again quite properly, that Niagara was entitled to reject Carosi’s tender 
    bid if Niagara decided that it did not want to do business with Carosi based 
    on the information it received from the references provided by Carosi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Nor, was Niagara under any obligation to advise Carosi of the substance 
    of the references.<span

    Carosi because of the negative reference, it is wrong to characterize that

    owed no obligation of good faith to Carosi until proper tender documents were

    There was absolutely nothing in their testimony [the witnesses for Niagara]

    information and that Niagara made all reasonable efforts to acquire that information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    error.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There was ample evidence to 
    support the trial judge’s findings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mr. 
    O’Connor’s arguments certainly demonstrate that there was an evidentiary basis 
    for different findings than those made by the trial judge.<span

    </span>There was, however, other evidence supporting the contention that the 
    inadequacies were important and undermined any attempt to effectively assess

    rejected the evidence relied on by Carosi to support the insignificance of 
    the inadequacies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is not this court’s 
    function to reassess the relative merits of the competing descriptions of

    </span> The trial judge made two errors in principle in awarding costs on 
    a substantial indemnity basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First, 
    she characterized Carosi’s allegations made in his pleadings and at trial 
    as allegations of “improper conduct by professionals in respect of their professional

    is an overstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Allegations of 
    institutional bad faith made in the context of contractual negotiations do 
    not, in our view, equate with the kind of personal allegations of dishonesty

'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The second error in principle arises out of the trial judge’s holding 
    that Carosi’s previous counsel’s behaviour was so egregious as to warrant 
    a cost sanction against Carosi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She 
    found that the conduct of prior counsel was unprofessional and increased the 
    length of and complexity of the proceedings.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We also agree that counsel’s conduct merited 
    a cost sanction against Carosi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, 
    prior counsel left the case a year before the trial commenced.<span

    counsel who was retained a year before the trial and who conducted the trial 
    was anything but appropriate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 
    trial judge erred in principle in holding that the conduct of counsel discharged 
    a year before the trial justified an order of costs on a substantial indemnity 
    basis through to the end of the trial. <span style="mso-spacerun:

    the complexity of the case, the conduct of the parties, the amount in issue

    costs in this case, we also bear in mind the amount of the partial indemnity 
    bill submitted by counsel at trial and the fact that the trial judge reduced 
    the substantial indemnity bill by some 25 percent.<span style="mso-spacerun:
