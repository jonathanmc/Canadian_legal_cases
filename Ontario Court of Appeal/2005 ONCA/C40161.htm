    establishes that a letter (as well as a card and an envelope) were authored 
    by the complainant, J.B., in or around January 1966.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The complainant had denied at trial that she was the author of the

    that she had been repeatedly raped by the appellant over the fourteen months 
    prior to the date of the letter.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The fresh evidence also has potential impeachment value as it applies 
    to the evidence of J.B.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It demonstrates 
    at a minimum that her recollection as to authorship of the letter was wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>A jury could, however, infer that she deliberately lied when she denied 
    writing the letter.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Either finding, but particularly the second, 
    could have a strong adverse effect on her credibility.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>J.B.’s evidence was crucial to the Crown’s 
    case on counts one (rape of J.B.) and three (indecent assault of J.B.).<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The Crown argued that the evidence should not be admitted because 
    the appellant had failed to demonstrate due diligence.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The exercise of due diligence is not a prerequisite 
    to the admission of fresh evidence in criminal appeals.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the interests of justice require that the 
    evidence be admitted, it will be received even though due diligence was not 
    exercised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In any event, we are satisfied 
    that the appellant has demonstrated due diligence.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Trial counsel made many efforts to obtain a 
    contemporaneous sample of J.B.’s handwriting which could be compared with 
    the letter by a qualified expert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Counsel’s 
    task was made difficult by the passage of some thirty-five years.<span

    the complainant authored the letter and that he received it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is true that the appellant could have done 
    so, but the availability of the appellant’s testimony that J.B. authored the 
    letter has nothing to do with whether trial counsel exercised due diligence 
    in respect of obtaining the appropriate expert evidence.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The appellant’s evidence that the complainant 
    authored the letter depended entirely on his credibility and was in no way 
    comparable to the opinion evidence of a qualified expert that the letter was 
    written by the J.B.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    demonstrate that there was no other evidence available at trial relevant to 
    the issue on which the fresh evidence is adduced.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The fact that the appellant could have testified 
    as to the authorship of the letter has nothing to do with whether counsel 
    exercised due diligence in obtaining an expert’s opinion as to the authorship

    </span> In some circumstances, the failure of the defence to lead the evidence

    and support the argument that the fresh evidence could not have affected the 
    verdict.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That is not the case here:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>the authorship of the letter was a significant feature of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    could have affected the verdict on all counts on which the appellant was convicted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The fresh evidence has a direct impact on counts one and three where 
    J.B. was the named complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It 
    has an indirect impact on the indecent assault charges in counts six, seven 
    and eight involving three other complainants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The jury was told that it could consider J.B.’s evidence relating to 
    count three (the indecent assault against her) when considering their verdicts 
    on counts six, seven and eight.</p>

    </span> Furthermore, J.B.’s evidence of the repeated rapes by the appellant 
    (count one) could have impacted on the jury’s consideration of counts six, 
    seven and eight given the unsatisfactory limiting instruction provided by 
    the trial judge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

    </span> Although it is not necessary for us to go further, we wish to add 
    an additional comment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With respect 
    to the severance argument advanced by the appellant, we do not read <i>R. 
    v. Thomas</i> (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 31 (Ont. C.A.) as holding that severance 
    must automatically be granted whenever a trial judge determines that certain 
    charges may not be considered as similar fact evidence in relation to other 
    charges in the indictment because they are more egregious than the other charges 
    and carry with them a risk of moral prejudice reasoning.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If severance is not ordered in such cases, 
    however, then it is incumbent on the trial judge to warn the jury in the clearest 
    of terms about the impropriety of engaging in moral prejudice reasoning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Unfortunately, as indicated above, we are not satisfied that the trial 
    judge gave that instruction in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>There was a real risk that the jury would misuse the evidence tendered 
    on count one (rape) when considering counts six, seven and eight (the indecent 
    assault charges involving the other complainants).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appeal is allowed, the convictions are quashed and a new trial 
    is ordered in all counts on which the appellant was convicted.<span
