    unusual one.</p>
  <p class=HeadingQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>This case is much different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    of whether or not the bank insists on immediate payment by the mortgagor on 
    maturity of the mortgage.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span> [T]he most compelling words, in my view, 
    are those which state that the liability of the guarantor shall continue

    </span>In 1987, the mortgagor sold the property to the transferee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>In 1991, when the five-year term expired, the mortgagee agreed with 
    the transferee to renew the mortgage for a further five years at a reduced 
    rate of interest. The mortgagor was not notified of the renewal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>When the transferee defaulted, the mortgagee sold the property under 
    power of sale and sued the mortgagor for the deficiency. On motion by the 
    mortgagor for summary judgment dismissing the mortgagees claim, the motion 
    judge held that the agreement between the mortgagee and the transferee was 
    a renewal and not an extension agreement and that the renewal clause did not 
    bind the mortgagor to an agreement of which he had no notice. She granted 
    the mortgagors motion, and the mortgagee appealed.</span></p>

    </span>Rosenberg J.A., speaking for the court, held that, when read together,

    the mortgagor did not remain liable on the covenant once the mortgage was 
    renewed with the transferee without notice to the mortgagor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>This was so because the renewal clause distinguished between renewals 
    and extensions and the default clause did not refer to renewals.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Speaking for the court, Rosenberg J.A. noted 
    (at para. 15) there was an important difference between the position of the 
    guarantor in <i>Manulife</i> and that of the mortgagor in <i>Citadel General</i>.<span

    contained a guarantor clause, it did not apply to the mortgagor.<span

  <p class=HeadingQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[S]ince the liability

    </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-GB>Bank of Montreal v. Negin </span></i><span
lang=EN-GB>was decided by this court in December 1996, a little over a month after 
    the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Manulife</i>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Judgment in <i>Negin </i>was deliberately reserved 
    to await the release of that decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Upon a consideration of the reasons for judgment and of the language 
    of the guarantee provisions in <i>Manulife</i>, this court distinguished that 
    case and held the guarantor liable under his guarantee in the original mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>As I have noted, the relevant provisions of the guarantee in the present 
    case are, for present purposes, identical with those found in the guarantee 
    in <i>Negin</i>.<span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Counsel for the appellant in the present case 
    did not suggest, either in his factum or in oral argument, that <i>Negin </i>was 
    incorrectly decided.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In such circumstances, 
    this court will not readily depart from a previous decision on the same issue: 
    <i>Bates v. Bates</i> (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 1 at paras. 30-31.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>It follows, in my view, that this court should apply <i>Negin </i>as 
    conclusive of the issue in this case and that this court is bound to apply 
    it in deciding this appeal.<span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Although I find that <i>Negin</i> is dispositive 
    of this appeal, I should like to address three submissions made by counsel 
    for the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First, he argued 
    that this case is directly on point with the decision in <i>Manulife</i>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This submission overlooks the fact that, unlike 
    the agreement in <i>Manulife</i>, the mortgage in this case does not contain 
    a separate clause that casts doubt on the certainty of the language in the 
    guarantee clause.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the present case, 
    the terms dealing with extensions of time to pay and the amendment of other 
    terms were all set out in a single guarantee clause.</span></p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Second, counsel for the appellant argued that 
    <i>Manulife </i>stands for the principle that the provision of a signature 
    line on a renewal agreement indicates that a guarantor is not waiving her 
    rights to protection, and that he or she must specifically consent to the 
    renewal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In <i>Negin</i>, however, 
    McKinlay J.A. observed (at p. 325) that she did not take <i>Manulife </i>to 
    state that one can use the line in an extension or renewal agreement marked 
    for execution by a guarantor to assist in the interpretation of another document.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Third, counsel for the appellant argued that 
    the agreement between the mortgagor and the mortgagee in the present case 
    was a renewal agreement as opposed to an extension, and that <i>Manulife </i>stands 
    for the proposition that a renewal agreement requires the explicit consent 
    of the guarantor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I do not agree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The reason <i>Manulife </i>distinguished between renewals and extensions 
    was because, in that case, the guarantee and indemnity clause referred only 
    to extensions, whereas the renewal or extension of time clause referred 
    both to renewals and extensions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There is no such asymmetry in the present case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span><i>Negin</i>, <i>Laurentian Bank </i>and <i>Tkachuk</i> all conclude 
    that the very clause used in the present case is clear and unambiguous.</span></p>
