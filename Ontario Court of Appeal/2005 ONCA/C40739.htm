    issues in this lawsuit are whether the respondent chartered accounting firm, 
    Orenstein &amp; Partners (“Orenstein”), breached the standard of care required 
    of it in performing a review engagement; and, if so, whether its breach caused 
    the loss claimed by the appellant Bernard Sherman.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>Sherman 
    is an astute businessman, an experienced investor, and the chair of Apotex 
    Inc., Canada’s largest generic drug manufacturer. In the mid 1980s, Sherman 
    invested in two tax shelters by purchasing all the units of two Limited Partnerships: 
    the Great Gatsby and Elegance. These and seventy-seven other similar limited 
    partnerships were formed to invest in luxury sea-going yachts. Overseas Credit 
    and Guarantee Corporation (“OCGC”) was the general partner of all the limited 
    partnerships.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> OCGC loaned 
    Sherman the money to buy the units in Gatsby and Elegance. Sherman made monthly 
    interest payments on the loans, which he deducted along with other expenses 
    and losses for Gatsby and Elegance on his income tax returns for 1985 – 89.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The Limited 
    Partnerships turned out to be a sham. They did not conduct the business they 
    claimed to conduct. OCGC became insolvent and its principals were convicted 
    of fraud. After an audit, Revenue Canada disallowed the tax losses and interest 
    deductions that Sherman had claimed for the years 1985 – 88. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Orenstein 
    performed review engagements of the financial statements of twenty-two of 
    the limited partnerships, including Gatsby and Elegance. The respondent Albert 
    Title, a partner at the firm, did the work. The respondent Peter Browning, 
    another partner, reviewed Title’s work and also did some accounting and tax 
    work for OCGC.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Sherman 
    sued the respondents for negligence. He claimed that they negligently failed 
    to include in the financial statements of Gatsby and Elegance a “going concern” 
    note. He claimed this note would have alerted him that the Limited Partnerships 
    would not likely become operating businesses. He alleged that had the respondents 
    included a going concern note, he would have stopped making interest payments 
    much sooner than he did. He quantified his loss at more than $600,000. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In comprehensive 
    reasons, Cullity J. dismissed the action. He concluded that the respondents 
    did not breach the standard of care required for a review engagement. He also 
    concluded that even if the respondents had included a going concern note, 
    Sherman either would not have noticed it, or, if he did, would not have stopped 
    making interest payments. </p>

    </span> Gatsby was formed in 1985. Sherman acquired all the Gatsby partnership 
    units in December 1985. However, he was not satisfied with the documentation. 
    He refused to close the transaction until April 29, 1986, when he reached 
    a settlement agreement with OCGC and Bellfield. Under the terms of that agreement, 
    OCGC and Bellfield guaranteed any deficiency in Sherman’s expected tax write-offs 
    and gave him the right to set off the deficiency against his monthly interest 
    payments. </p>

    </span> From January 1, 1986 to December 31, 1989 (when he stopped paying 
    OCGC), Sherman made monthly interest payments on his Gatbsy loan in the amount 
    of $12,999.84. From January 1, 1987, to December 31, 1989, Sherman made monthly

    partnerships. The respondents knew about the audit. Browning dealt with Revenue 
    Canada on behalf of OCGC. As a result of its audit, Revenue Canada disallowed

    his 1986 income tax return would not be processed until the audits of Gatsby 
    and Elegance were completed. In October 1987, OCGC sent a memorandum to its 
    limited partners, including Sherman, advising them of the Revenue Canada audit.

    </span> In May 1989, Revenue Canada concluded that the businesses of the limited

    Canada wrote Sherman to tell him that his 1985, 1986, and 1987 income tax 
    returns would be reassessed, and that his claims for partnership losses, interest 
    expenses, and other costs related to Gatsby would be disallowed. Revenue Canada’s 
    letter said that “the general partner failed to demonstrate that the partnership 
    was properly constituted and carrying on a business,” and that the loans given 
    by OCGC appeared “to have no substance and in any event were not laid out 
    to earn income.”</p>

    Gatsby and Elegance. Sherman claims that the respondents should have added 
    this note in the 1987 financial statements, and that he would have seen that 
    note in the spring of 1988. He therefore seeks damages equivalent to his monthly

    of care required of an accountant doing a review engagement. The trial judge 
    held that the respondents owed Sherman a duty of care, but he also held that 
    they had met the standard of care required of them.</p>

    </span> Sherman submits that in so holding, the trial judge erred in law by 
    applying the wrong standard of care. His submission has two branches: the 
    trial judge wrongly held that the standard is sufficiently vague and elastic 
    to make differences of opinion inevitable; and the trial judge misstated what 
    information ought to trigger an accountant’s further enquiries and decision 
    to include a going concern note. I do not accept either branch of this submission.

    </span> The standard of care required of an accountant performing a review 
    engagement has already been canvassed by my colleague MacPherson J.A. in <i>Bloor 
    Italian Gifts Ltd</i>. <i>v. Dixon</i> (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 760 (C.A.). I 
    do not intend to repeat his thorough discussion of that standard. I will simply 
    summarize the principles relevant for this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> First, the <i>Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants’ Handbook</i> 
    (<i>CICA Handbook)</i> is a persuasive guide to the applicable standard of 
    care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Second, the <i>CICA Handbook<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1'
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'> [1] </span></span></a></i> stipulates 
    that a review engagement has a limited objective: the accountant must assess 
    the information reported on against the standard of plausibility. The <i>Handbook</i> 
    states that a review engagement consists “primarily of enquiry, analytical 
    procedures and discussion related to information supplied to the public accountant 
    by the enterprise with the limited objective of assessing whether the information 
    being reported on is plausible within the framework of appropriate criteria.” 
    “Plausible” means “appearing to be worthy of belief.” See <i>Bloor Italian 
    Gifts </i>at para. 28. An accountant has an obligation to make further enquiry 
    only if the information supplied by management casts doubt on its plausibility. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> A review engagement is therefore less demanding than an audit. Unlike 
    an audit, an accountant doing a review engagement does not undertake to verify 
    the accuracy of the information provided by the client. Instead, the accountant 
    assumes that the client is telling the truth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Third, although an accountant performing a review engagement must 
    have enough knowledge of the enterprise to make intelligent enquiries, the 
    accountant’s assessment of plausibility is largely<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>a matter of professional judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Fourth, a review engagement does not rule out the possibility of undetected 
    fraud or error. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In assessing the conduct of the respondents, the trial judge applied 
    the principles set out by MacPherson J.A. in <i>Bloor Italian Gifts</i>, including 
    those that I have outlined. Nonetheless, Sherman submits that Justice Cullity 
    fell into error because of the following passage in his reasons (at paras. 
    73-74):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I believe, also, that there is sufficient vagueness 
    in the concept of “plausible” financial statements to make it inevitable that 
    there would be differences of opinion in the accounting profession with respect 
    to its interpretation generally as well as in its application to particular 
    facts. This was borne out by the conflicting views of the experienced and 
    well-qualified chartered accountants who gave expert evidence in this case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The general standard applicable to review engagements 
    must, therefore, be considered to be somewhat elastic and this – as well as 
    the fact that errors of judgment are not necessarily negligence – must, I 
    believe, affect the degree of latitude permitted to the accountant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Sherman says that the required standard of care is neither vague nor 
    elastic, but clear and firm. However, I see no error in the trial judge’s 
    statement. As I read his reasons, he was simply stating the obvious: plausibility 
    is a general standard, and thus, at the margins, accountants exercising their 
    professional judgment may differ on whether information supplied by an enterprise 
    is or is not worthy of belief. Indeed, as the trial judge pointed out, the 
    two experts who testified in this case – Irving Rosen for Sherman, and Laurence 
    Rosen for Orenstein – did disagree on the plausibility of the information 
    Title relied on. And, as the trial judge also noted, differences in professional 
    judgment do not automatically lead to a finding of negligence. </p>

    engagements and a going concern note</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> A “going concern” is an enterprise that will continue in business. 
    In accountants’ terminology, the enterprise neither intends to nor needs to 
    liquidate or cease its operations within at least twelve months from the date 
    of its balance sheet. Thus, when an accountant attaches a going concern note 
    to an enterprise’s balance sheet, the accountant alerts its readers that within 
    the next year the enterprise is unlikely to continue to operate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> A going concern note is obviously a serious addition to an enterprise’s 
    financial statement. It may destroy the business of the enterprise. Accountants 
    understandably exercise caution before including such a note. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Moreover, the respondents’ expert Laurence Rosen testified that because 
    the inclusion of a going concern note is so serious, it requires of an accountant 
    the kind of enquiry that is incompatible with a review engagement. In his 
    view, an accountant would have to “stumble over something before he would 
    pursue it.” Nothing less would trigger the kind of investigation required 
    before an accountant could justifiably include a going concern note in an 
    enterprise’s financial statement. The trial judge preferred Laurence Rosen’s 
    opinion on the interplay between a going concern note and a review engagement 
    to that of Sherman’s expert, because it was more “practical and persuasive.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Sherman argues that we should reject Laurence Rosen’s opinion. Instead, 
    he says,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>we should hold that an accountant 
    doing a review engagement is required to consider adding a going concern note 
    and that much less than a “stumble” test is required to trigger an investigation 
    leading to the inclusion of such a note.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>There are two answers to this 
    argument. First, the trial judge was entitled to accept the opinion of the 
    respondents’ expert. It was, as the trial judge noted, supported by the absence 
    of any reference to a going concern note in the section of the <i>CICA</i> 
    <i>Handbook</i> dealing with review engagements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Second, however, the trial judge still acknowledged that cases might 
    arise where information gathered in the course of a review engagement should 
    prompt an accountant to add a going concern note to an enterprise’s financial 
    statement. In the words of the trial judge, “however, if in the mind of a 
    reasonable accountant, the information obtained in the course of a review 
    would raise real doubts as to the ability of the business to continue as a 
    going concern, I do not think such doubts could properly have been ignored.” 
    Sherman could not legitimately ask for a more onerous standard than this.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In my view, the trial judge applied the correct standard of care to 
    the respondents’ review engagement of the financial statements of Gatsby and 
    Elegance. </p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText2>2. Did the trial judge err in concluding that the respondents 
    were not negligent in failing to include a going concern note in the 1987 
    financial statements of Gatsby and Elegance?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> At trial, Sherman advanced two related arguments why the respondents 
    were negligent or in breach of the standard of care required of them. They 
    failed to make adequate enquiries in the face of “material information” or 
    “red flags” that should have prompted these enquiries; and largely because<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>they did not make these enquiries, they also failed to add a going 
    concern note to the 1987 financial statements of Gatsby and Elegance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge rejected these arguments. He concluded that Title 
    asked proper questions of management, received plausible answers, and acquired 
    no information that called for further enquiries. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Also, in even considering including a going concern note in the 1987 
    financial statements, Title arguably went beyond, but at the very least met, 
    the standard of care required of an accountant performing a review engagement. 
    Indeed, Sherman’s expert Irving Rosen acknowledged as much. The trial judge 
    certainly concluded that Title had exercised reasonable care and skill. I 
    am not persuaded of any basis to interfere with that conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I will nonetheless address the three errors Sherman alleges the trial 
    judge made in coming to his conclusion. They are these: the trial judge did 
    not take account of the information Browning possessed by virtue of his work 
    for OCGC; the trial judge considered the so-called “red flags” individually, 
    but did not assess their cumulative impact on the plausibility of the financial 
    statements; and the trial judge erred by failing to hold that Title’s work 
    for Scace in 1990 was similar to a review engagement, and that therefore Title 
    could have discovered OCGC’s fraud two years earlier when it mattered to Sherman. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Browning apparently did not typically share information with Title. 
    I agree with Sherman that if Browning acquired information through his work 
    for OCGC<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>that was relevant to the 
    plausibility of the Gatsby and Elegance financial statements, Orenstein was 
    bound to use that information in doing the review engagements. I do not agree, 
    however, that Browning had any information that would have caused Title to 
    make further enquiries. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Sherman focuses on two pieces of information available to Browning. 
    Because he reviewed OCGC’s draft answers to the Revenue Canada audit, Browning 
    knew construction financing had not been drawn down; and according to Sherman, 
    Browning knew that the 1986 financial statement of OCGC, which originally 
    showed net earnings of $23 million was revised drastically downwards to show 
    a net loss of $11.7 million. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge addressed both pieces of information. As the trial 
    judge pointed out, the lack of financing was hardly a surprise. The need for 
    financing was evident from the outset. Browning did not prepare OCGC’s audited 
    statements, and the trial judge accepted his evidence that he did not recall 
    seeing the 1986 statement with the revised earnings figure. In addition, the 
    trial judge accepted the evidence of Title, Browning, and Laurence Rosen that 
    the earnings write-down was done for tax planning purposes, and did not reflect 
    the “financial health” of OCGC.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The other so-called “red flags” were considered by Title, and in turn 
    by the trial judge. They included: the Revenue Canada audit; the absence of 
    any yacht for Gatsby; the absence of any revenues for Gatsby or Elegance; 
    and OCGC’s lack of financing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> By itself, the Revenue Canada audit could not be classified as a “red 
    flag”. Sherman and the respondents were well aware that investing in these 
    limited partnerships was an aggressive form of tax planning that might attract 
    the interest of Revenue Canada. The lack of a yacht for Gatsby, and Gatsby’s 
    consequent failure to earn income were plausibly explained by problems with 
    the original shipbuilder and the substitution of a new builder. Elegance was 
    not expected to earn any income until 1990. Far from being without funds, 
    OCGC was receiving a steady flow of money in the form of interest payments. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In the light of the answers he received from management, Title concluded 
    that none of these “red flags” warranted further enquiry. The trial judge 
    agreed. To say otherwise would judge the respondents with the benefit of hindsight.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Still, Sherman contends that the trial judge erred by assessing the 
    impact of each piece of information available to Title individually, instead 
    of cumulatively. The trial judge’s reasons contradict this contention. At 
    para. 95 of his reasons, he held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Despite Mr. Jack’s meticulous and painstaking attempts 
    to find warning signals in an accumulation of information acquired by Mr. 
    Title, together with that to be attributed to him through the knowledge of 
    Mr. Browning, I do not believe that, without the benefit of hindsight, the 
    signals were anything like as clear as counsel submitted, or that the attention 
    and the responses they received from Mr. Title were inadequate. For these 
    reasons, I am dismissing the claims against the defendants for negligent provision 
    of services. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none'>This holding 
    completely answers Sherman’s contention. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In 1990, Scace, on behalf of the limited partners, asked Title to 
    investigate OCGC’s finances. Title did so, and discovered that OCGC had committed 
    fraud. Title described his mandate from Scace as “a review consisting primarily 
    of enquiry analytical procedures and discussion relating to information provided 
    by … OCGC.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Sherman submits that Title’s own description of his mandate parallels 
    an accountant’s task in doing a review engagement. Thus, Sherman argues that 
    what Title did in 1990, he should have done in the spring of 1988. Sherman 
    submits that the trial judge erred in failing to so find. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge rightly rejected Sherman’s argument. Despite the language 
    Title used to describe his mandate for Scace, as the trial judge pointed out, 
    Title’s investigation in 1990 was “more thorough and penetrating” than would 
    be required for a review engagement. And there were two other important differences 
    between what Title did for Scace and what Sherman wanted him to do. First, 
    Title’s work for Scace took place in 1990. The trial judge reasonably observed 
    that it was unclear Title would have arrived at a similar conclusion two years 
    earlier. Second, Scace asked Title to inquire into the financial<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>ability of OCGC. That is quite different from an enquiry into the plausibility 
    of the financial statements of the Limited Partnerships.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> In my view, Sherman has failed to establish that the trial 
    judge erred in concluding the respondents had not breached the standard of 
    care required of them. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge dealt with these two causation issues together, and 
    so will I. Although the trial judge found that in failing to include a going 
    concern note, the respondents had not fallen below the standard of care required 
    of them, he nonetheless considered whether the inclusion of such a note would 
    have altered Sherman’s conduct. He found that it would not have done so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge found that even if a going concern note had been included 
    in the financial statements of Gatsby and Elegance, Sherman either would not 
    have noticed it, or if he did notice it, he would not have stopped making 
    interest payments earlier than he did. In essence, the trial judge held that 
    once Sherman had made his investments, he paid virtually no attention to them. 
    In paras. 97 and 98 of his reasons, the trial judge sets out his important 
    findings on causation:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Nor would I find that Dr. Sherman would have decided 
    to cease payments of interest if the financial statements for 1987 had contained 
    such a note drawing the unit holder’s attention to delays in obtaining financing, 
    and in the acquisition of yachts, and the effect that this might have on the 
    operation of the businesses for which the limited partnerships had purportedly 
    been established. <u>I am not</u> <u>satisfied that he would have noticed 
    a going concern note or, if he had done so, that he would have taken any action. 
    The absence of any evidence of his discussions with his professional advisers 
    is consistent with my general impression that, once the investments were made, 
    he paid little, if any, attention to them.</u> His inaction and passivity 
    continued after he had received the initial letter of August 25, 1987 from 
    Revenue Canada while other investors were voicing their concerns at the annual 
    meetings of the limited partnerships. It was not until November 1988, when 
    he asked Mr. Florence to attend the meeting to be held on December 6, that 
    he first showed any interest in the tax issues that threatened to destroy 
    the value of his investment. Even then there was no evidence of any report 
    received from Mr. Florence or, indeed, that he had attended the meeting. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given the lack of any evidence of information or 
    advice received from his professional advisers, the suggestion that they were 
    paying attention for him was not persuasive. <u>It was more probable, I believe, 
    that he had too many business concerns and other responsibilities to enable, 
    or motivate, him to attend to his investments in the limited partnerships.</u> 
    The burden of proving that any loss he suffered by continuing to pay interest 
    after April 1988 was caused by the accountants’ failure to place a going-concern 
    note in the financial statements for 1987 is on Dr. Sherman. <u>On a balance 
    of probabilities, I am not satisfied that he, or his advisers, would have 
    read such a note or that, if he had done so, it would have affected his decision. 
    In the circumstances, I would find that the burden of proving causation was 
    not discharged</u>. [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> These findings are, of course, findings of fact, protected in this 
    court by a highly deferential standard of review. In order to overturn them, 
    Sherman must demonstrate that these findings are tainted by palpable and overriding 
    error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Sherman submits that he can meet this stringent standard of review. 
    He contends that these findings reflect palpable and overriding error because 
    they conflict with evidence the trial judge had already accepted: the evidence 
    that Sherman stopped making payments in 1990 after hearing rumours of fraud 
    and consulting with his professional advisers. At para. 19 of his reasons, 
    during his review of the narrative, the trial judge observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the end of 1988, Dr. Sherman continued his practice 
    of sending post-dated cheques for interest payable each month in the coming 
    year. He did not comply with the request for cheques for 1990. He testified 
    that he had heard rumours that suggested the possibility of fraud and, after 
    consulting Mr. Florence and his tax counsel, David Nathanson, he decided not 
    to make further payments. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Sherman argues that this paragraph conflicts with the trial judge’s 
    later findings on causation, and that therefore those findings cannot stand. 
    He says that either he or his advisers would likely have reviewed the financial 
    statements of Gatsby and Elegance. And, his later action in stopping payments 
    shows that it was inconceivable he would have ignored a going concern note 
    if one had been included. </p>

    </span> If the trial judge’s findings of fact on causation were not rooted 
    in the evidence – in other words, if there was no evidence to support them 
    – then they would amount to palpable and overriding errors. But that is not 
    the case. I see nothing inconsistent between the trial judge’s observation 
    at para. 19 of his reasons, and his later findings on causation. More importantly, 
    there was a good deal of evidence to support these causation findings. </p>

    </span> The main evidence supporting the finding that Sherman would not have 
    noticed a going concern note came from him. He testified that he did not recall 
    reviewing the financial statements of Gatsby and Elegance. Indeed, he gave 
    evidence that he could not even recall whether he requested these statements 
    or received them. Although Sherman also gave evidence that his advisers would 
    likely have reviewed the financial statements on his behalf, not one of his 
    advisers testified at trial. </p>

    </span> More broadly, I think the record also shows that in deciding to invest 
    and to continue to make interest payments, Sherman relied not on the advice 
    of the respondents or on the financial statements prepared by them, but on 
    the assurances given by OCGC and its sole shareholder, Bellfield. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Sherman at first refused to close the transaction because he had not 
    received documents and assurances that satisfied him. Eventually, on April 
    29, 1986, Sherman, OCGC, and Bellfield entered into a settlement agreement. 
    Under that agreement, OCGC and Bellfield guaranteed Sherman’s income tax deductions 
    and write-offs, and agreed that he could set off any deficiency against his 
    monthly interest payments. With these assurances and security, Sherman closed 
    his investment transactions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Sherman admitted at trial that he required the April 1986 agreement 
    to satisfy himself that the business was legitimate. From the outset, he was 
    aware that Revenue Canada might disallow his tax deductions and write-offs. 
    However, having sought and obtained guarantees from OCGC and Bellfield, he 
    was comfortable with the risk. By contrast, during the entire period, he never 
    once sought the respondents’ advice on his investments. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Sherman had the burden to show that on a balance of probabilities 
    he would have acted on a going concern note, if the respondents had included 
    one in the financial statements of Gatsby and Elegance. The evidence that 
    I have reviewed supports the trial judge’s finding of fact that even if the 
    respondents had included such a note, Sherman would not have noticed it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge’s finding – which I would uphold – that Sherman would 
    not have noticed a going concern note disposes of the causation issue. However, 
    the record amply supports the trial judge’s alternative causation finding: 
    even if Sherman had noticed a going concern note, he would not have acted 
    differently. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Admittedly, by 1990 Sherman did stop making interest payments. The 
    trial judge, however, had a lot of evidence to indicate that even a going 
    concern note would not have prompted Sherman to stop payments earlier. That 
    evidence consists of the numerous pieces of information bringing into question 
    the viability and legitimacy of Sherman’s investments – information that Sherman 
    knew about, yet ignored, all the while continuing to make his monthly interest 
    payments. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> For example, as early as 1986, Sherman knew that the Gatsby yacht 
    would have to be replaced or rebuilt because of problems with the shipyard. 
    By late 1988, Sherman was aware of the concerns expressed by purchasers of 
    units of other limited partnerships at the annual meeting of investors held 
    in August. In late November 1988, Sherman received a letter from OCGC advising 
    him and the other investors of the uncertain status of their investments and 
    of their tax write-offs. As early as January 1989, his professional advisers 
    told Sherman that his tax write-offs might be disallowed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Most telling of all, in June 1989, Sherman received a letter from 
    Revenue Canada advising him that OCGC had failed to demonstrate Gatsby was 
    properly constituted and carrying on business, and that OCGC’s loans appeared 
    to have no substance and did not appear to have been made with any intent 
    to earn income. Revenue Canada’s letter was at least as dire a warning about 
    OCGC’s viability as a going concern note would have been. Yet, in the face 
    of this letter, Sherman made no enquiries about the status of the two yachts, 
    and he continued to make monthly interest payments for another six months.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the light of this evidence, the trial judge 
    can hardly be said to have been palpably wrong in concluding that Sherman 
    would not have taken any action on a going concern note.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I make one concluding observation. This was a thirteen-day trial. 
    The trial judge lived through this trial and, unlike this court, heard all 
    the evidence as it unfolded. He had the opportunity, unavailable to us, to 
    observe the appellant testify over two days. He was left with the impression 
    of a man with too many businesses and other responsibilities and interests 
    to pay much attention to his investments once he had made them. Much of the 
    evidence confirming this impression came from Sherman himself. This court 
    would not be justified in interfering with the trial judge’s assessment of 
    Sherman and of his likely inaction even if the respondents had done what the 
    appellant claims they should have done. Cases such as this one demonstrate 
    the wisdom of a highly deferential standard of appellate review. I would dismiss 
    the appeal.</p>
  <h3>D. CONCLUSION </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge did not apply the wrong standard of care for a review 
    engagement. Nor did he err in concluding that the respondents were not negligent 
    in failing to include a going concern note in the financial statements of 
    Gatsby and Elegance. Moreover, even if the respondents had included a going 
    concern note, the trial judge did not commit a palpable and overriding error 
    in finding either that Sherman would not have noticed such a note, or that 
    if he did notice it, he would not have acted on it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondents on a partial 
    indemnity basis. Counsel advised the court that they likely could agree on 
    the amount of costs. If they are unable to do so, they may make written submission 
    to the court within thirty days of the release of these reasons. Finally, 
    I thank both counsel for a well-argued appeal. </p>
