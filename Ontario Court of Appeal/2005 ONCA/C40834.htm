  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>On appeal from the judgment of Stinson, J. of 
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated September 29, 2003. </h4>
  <h4>BY THE COURT:</h4>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>This is an appeal 
    from the judgment of Stinson J., given after a thirty-three day trial. The 
    trial judge awarded the respondent, Mason Homes Limited, $4,026,660 in damages 
    for its lost opportunity to develop a shopping plaza, a loss that he found 
    was caused by The Oshawa Group Limiteds repudiation of its agreement to be 
    the plazas anchor tenant. By cross-appeal, the respondent challenges the 
    trial judges 50% reduction of its costs, more specifically, the 50% reduction 
    of its disbursements.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal;mso-list:none'><b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>The Trial Decision</b></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>The trial judge 
    found that the parties agreement regarding the appellants tenancy was initially 
    reflected in a December 1989 Letter of Intent. That Letter of Intent provided 
    that the agreement was subject to contract; that is, subject to subsequent 
    settlement of the particulars of the lease within a set period of time (45 
    days). On the factual findings of the trial judge, that set date was extended 
    several times by mutual agreement. It finally expired on June 29, 1990 without 
    settlement of the lease terms.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>After the June 
    1990 expiry date, the parties continued to negotiate the terms for a lease. 
    The trial judge determined that these negotiations were no longer subject 
    to contract and that the parties reached a new, final, oral, independent 
    agreement on all the terms of a lease on or about December 11, 1990. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>Subsequently, 
    the respondent attempted to vary the terms of the December 1990 agreement 
    in three respects: first, to change the construction date; second, to change 
    the basement retail space; and, third, to amend the construction schedule. 
    The trial judge determined, however, that the parties never reached an agreement 
    to vary the December 1990 agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>In April 1991, 
    the appellant repudiated the December 1990 agreement. Given changes in the 
    economy and a competitors decision to open a near-by store, the appellant 
    no longer favoured a large flagship store at the respondents location. Instead, 
    it would only commit to a significantly smaller store.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>As a result of 
    the appellants repudiation, the trial judge found that the respondent lost 
    its opportunity to develop the plaza. After applying a 35% deduction for contingencies, 
    the trial judge assessed the respondents damages at $4,026,660. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span

    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>The appellant 
    appeals on six grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First, it 
    alleges, to the prejudice of the appellant, that the trial judge found liability 
    on the basis of a breach of an independent oral contract that was neither 
    pleaded, nor advanced at trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Second, apart from the question of pleadings, the trial judge made 
    a palpable and overriding error of fact by finding a December 1990 oral contract. 
    Third, the trial judge erred by failing to consider the whole of the evidence, 
    including the respondents subsequent conduct, in determining whether the 
    parties had reached a binding agreement in December 1990. Fourth, in view 
    of the respondents claim for specific performance, the trial judge erred 
    in concluding that the respondent, after affirming the contract, was relieved 
    from performance of its obligation under that contract. Fifth, the trial judge 
    erred in the date chosen on which to assess damages. Sixth, the trial judge 
    erred in assessing the respondent's damages on the basis of a 75,000 sq. ft. 
    plaza rather than on the basis of the 90,000 sq. ft. plaza originally contemplated 
    by the parties. </span></p>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>1.<span

  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>The appellant 
    argues that the trial judge erred in finding an independent oral agreement 
    on or about December 11, 1990 when the pleadings and evidence had been directed 
    to an agreement arising from the Letter of Intent, and, accordingly, an agreement 
    subject to contract. Once the trial judge concluded that there was no continuing 
    Letter of Intent, the appellant argues that the respondent necessarily could 
    not succeed in its claim. Further, the appellant argues that the respondent 
    pleaded only an agreement in December 1989, or an agreement in February 1991, 
    but not an oral agreement on or about December 11, 1990. Finally, the appellant 
    claims that the respondents trial counsel (not Mr. Pape) made clear in his 
    submissions that, in relation to the December 1990 negotiations, he relied 
    on the December 1989 Letter of Intent as the underlying contract and no other. 
    The appellant cannot succeed on these arguments for several reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span></span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>First, while the 
    respondent did plead that agreements were reached in 1989 and 1991, it also 
    pleaded that &quot;[f]urther negotiations ensued with respect to the settlement 
    of the lease and the lease form was settled on or about December 11, 1990&quot; 
    (Amended Amended Amended Amended Statement of Claim, para. 8). In addition, 
    paragraph 17 of the amended claim refers to the lease agreement as agreed 
    at December 11, 1990. From these paragraphs, as well as paragraphs 24 and 
    25 of the amended claim, it was reasonable for the trial judge to conclude 
    that the pleading raised the issue of the existence and breach of an agreement 
    to lease between the parties, reached on or about December 11, 1990. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>Second, the negotiations 
    over the terms of a lease were the central focus of considerable evidence 
    called at trial, as well as in the parties openings and submissions at trial. 
    The reasons of the trial judge, both for judgment and in the later motion 
    to amend the Statement of Claim, clearly reflect that the parties were alert 
    to the question of whether a binding agreement was reached on or about December

    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>Whether the December 
    agreement was pursuant to the Letter of Intent or an independent agreement 
    depended on the trial judges application of the law to his factual findings. 
    In our view, he was entitled to conclude that this agreement was independent 
    of the Letter of Intent. Neither the manner of the respondents pleading nor 
    the conduct of the trial prejudiced the appellant. The appellant was alert 
    to the issue of a December 1990 agreement and called evidence to meet that 
    case. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span

    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>The centrality 
    of the December 1990 agreement at the trial is also apparent from the trial 
    judges reasons where he cited the appellants theory that the Letter of Intent 
    lapsed and that, thereafter, the argument was directed to the negotiation 
    of a new binding agreement, a goal that was never attained. (Reasons, para. 
    114). In effect, the appellant raised the very issue that it now claims took 
    it by surprise.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span

    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>Third, the trial 
    judge was entitled to his finding that in December 1990, the parties were 
    not dealing with each other subject to contract, an argument that he specifically 
    considered in paras. 208-212 of his reasons. Indeed, the trial judge concluded 
    that the new December 1990 agreement included the complete text of a lease. 
    Viewed in this context, the words subject to contract in the original Letter 
    of Intent had no application to and were irrelevant to the subsequent agreement.

    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>Fourth, we see 
    the facts pleaded as supporting the trial judges factual finding that the 
    lease was settled in December 1990. From that finding, the trial judge was 
    entitled to apply the law to determine that the settled lease amounted to 
    an enforceable agreement, and to find a breach of that agreement. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>We reject the 
    appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to consider the evidence 
    as a whole and erred in finding an oral agreement made on or about December 
    11, 1990. In careful and detailed reasons, the trial judge explained why he 
    accepted certain evidence, why he rejected other evidence, and why he drew 
    certain inferences. The trial judge's factual findings were supported by the 
    evidence and the appellant has failed to persuade us of any palpable or overriding 
    error in those findings. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>The appellant 
    argues that the trial judge was obliged to consider the conduct of the parties 
    post-December 1990 to see whether the parties had reached an agreement on 
    that date. In this case, the appellant argues, the parties subsequent conduct 
    in pursuing negotiations post-December 1990, and the respondents conduct 
    in continuing negotiations with Sobeys as a potential anchor tenant, were 
    clear evidence that the parties had not concluded an agreement in December 
    1990. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>In our view, however, 
    the trial judge was alive to the post-December 1990 conduct. He determined 
    that the subsequent negotiations did not support a finding that there was 
    no December 1990 agreement. Rather, he determined that those negotiations 
    represented a desire by the respondent to vary the terms of the December 1990 
    contract. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>In our view, the 
    evidence about Sobeys was not potentially significant to the trial judges 
    findings of fact. That evidence did not establish that the respondent was 
    in negotiations with Sobeys at the time. A reading of the trial judges reasons 
    indicates that he was alive to the parties positions, but he simply did not 
    consider that post-contract conduct to be significant. While it may have been 
    preferable if the trial judge had directly addressed this and other evidence 
    relating to post-December 1990 conduct, we are not persuaded that the trial 
    judge fell into reversible error on this issue.</span></p>

    <i>Waxman v. Waxman</i> (2004), 186 O.A.C. 201 at para. 344, where the trial 
    judges reasons demonstrate a strong command of the trial record and a careful 
    analysis of evidence leading to detailed findings of fact, it will be difficult 
    for an appellant to suggest that the mere failure to refer to a specific piece 
    of evidence demonstrates a failure to consider that evidence. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>In view of the 
    respondents claim for specific performance, the appellant argues that the 
    trial judge was obliged to dismiss the respondents claim because the respondent 
    had not proceeded with construction of the plaza by the date agreed upon. 
    The trial judge, however, found that the respondent was no longer able to 
    construct the plaza as a result of the appellants repudiation. This was a 
    finding supported by the evidence. In these circumstances, the trial judge 
    was entitled to assess damages on the respondents alternative claim for damages.

    </span></span> <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>In our view, the 
    trial judge properly exercised his discretion in considering information available 
    at the date of trial to assess damages. While generally damages are assessed 
    without reference to events occurring after the date of breach, exceptions 
    have been recognized to arrive at a fair assessment of damages. See <i>Laurentide 
    Motels v. Beauport City</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 705 at 829. The trial judge gave 
    cogent reasons for exercising his discretion to use available relevant information 
    in the assessment of damages. We see no reason to interfere with that exercise 
    of discretion. </span></p>

  <p style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> As found by the trial judge, the agreement reached by the parties 
    presumed a 90,000 sq. ft. plaza (Site Plan 2). Even though the trial judge 
    specifically found there was no agreement to build at 75,000 sq. ft. (Site 
    Plan 3), he assessed damages on the basis of Site Plan 3. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In addition to the difference in size, Site Plan 3 changed the location 
    of the appellants store within the plaza. Further, while phasing of construction 
    over two years was part of the Site Plan 2 proposal, Site Plan 3 involved 
    no phasing of construction. The appellant submits that these differences precluded 
    a proper assessment of damages.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> We see no error in the approach taken by the trial judge. The expert 
    testimony of both parties used Site Plan 3 as the template for the calculation 
    of damages. The trial judge was obliged to use the evidence presented to attempt 
    to arrive at a reasonable assessment of damages. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Here the appellant has not explained how the difference in the location 
    of the store would affect the damage calculation. The trial judge adverted 
    specifically to the difference in size and concluded that using the smaller 
    plaza as a model for the damage calculation would not be unfair. While both 
    the size and phasing of the plaza could be factors affecting damages, in the 
    absence of evidence showing that both the size and phasing of the plaza were 
    differences that impacted on the calculation of damages, it was open to the 
    trial judge to use the evidence relating to Site Plan 3 as a basis for calculating 
    the damages for the breach of the agreement to build Site Plan 2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    issue with the 50% reduction of its disbursements. While the respondent concedes 
    that the trial judge had a discretion to reduce disbursements, it argues that 
    the trial judge did not do so judicially. In our view, just as it was open 
    to the trial judge to deny costs altogether, it was within his discretion 
    to reduce both costs and disbursements for the reasons he gave: to reflect 
    the respondents failures with respect to production of documents and to reflect 
    the respondents failures in proceeding to trial in a timely manner. We see
