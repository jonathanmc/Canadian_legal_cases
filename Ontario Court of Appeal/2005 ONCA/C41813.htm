  <p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the order of Justice William Somers of the 
    Superior Court of Justice dated October 3, 2003.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>MACFARLAND J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The plaintiff appeals from an order of Somers J. striking out paragraphs 
    17(i), (ii) and the second sentence of paragraph 17(iv) of the statement of 
    claim without leave to amend pursuant to Rules 21 and 25 of the <i>Rules of 
    Civil Procedure</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The plaintiff is a woman of colour of Sri Lankan origin who claims 
    she was constructively dismissed by the defendant on the basis of race and 
    ethnic origin.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In her statement of claim the plaintiff states that she was recruited 
    by the defendant and offered a position as an Accident Benefits Claims Specialist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>She was told that because of her specialized training as a solicitor, 
    her role would focus on alternative dispute resolution files and management 
    of the litigation aspect of accident benefit claims proceedings before the 
    Financial Services Commission of Ontario.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>She pleads that on the basis of these assurances and the express assurance 
    that she would not be employed as a claims adjuster she accepted the offer 
    and began employment with the defendant on June 1, 1999.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Around August 31, 2002 the plaintiff pleads that she was demoted, 
    her work assignment was changed and her position became one of adjusting insurance 
    claims.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She concluded that she had 
    been constructively dismissed and left her employment with the defendant on 
    October 18, 2002.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> She brings this action against the defendant seeking damages for breach 
    of her contract of employment and for punitive damages.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Paragraph 17 of her statement of claim provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>17.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 
    plaintiff further states that Allianz breached an implied term of the employment 
    contract that the plaintiff would be employed without discrimination on the 
    basis of race.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The plaintiff, a woman 
    of colour, applied for three internal promotion positions while she was employed 
    at Allianz and, although in each case she was the most qualified candidate, 
    the position was granted to a Caucasian woman (see paras. 7, 9 and 12 above). 
    Without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the plaintiff states 
    that the discriminatory conduct of Allianz is evidenced by the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
mso-list:l5 level6 lfo70;'> (i) <i>Historically the Company has systemically discriminated 
    against employees of colour by invoking a “slow track” for promotion that 
    is not invoked for Caucasian employees</i>;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
mso-list:l5 level6 lfo70;'> (ii) <i>The Company promotes Caucasian employees notwithstanding 
    the existence of applicants of colour with superior qualifications</i>;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
mso-list:l5 level6 lfo70;'> (iii) The Company discriminated against the plaintiff 
    on grounds of race in her applications for internal promotion on three occasions, 
    where the position applied for was granted to a Caucasian employee of lesser 
    qualifications;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
mso-list:l5 level6 lfo70;'> (iv) The plaintiff was denied equal access to company 
    seminars and leadership conferences, including being dis-invited from the 
    April 2002 Leadership Fundamentals Workshop. <i>The Company has historically 
    denied access to Company seminars and leadership conferences to employees 
    of colour on a disproportionate basis relative to Caucasian employees; and</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
mso-list:l5 level6 lfo70;'> (v) The plaintiff was paid less in salary and bonuses 
    than Caucasian employees of similar or lesser seniority and job performance 
    were. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The motions judge struck the italicized portions of the pleading. 
    In his reasons the motions judge referred to this court’s decision in <i>L’Attiboudeaire 
    v. Royal Bank</i> (1996), 17 C.C.E.L. (2d) 86 and stated in part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In <i>L’Attiboudeaire </i>[<i>supra</i>], the Ontario 
    Court of Appeal distinguished the <i>L’Attiboudeaire</i> case on the grounds 
    that the racist actions were directed specifically at the plaintiff and formed 
    the atmosphere, which he felt was sufficiently poisoned that he could not 
    continue to work at that place and continue to experience the conduct, which 
    he specifically complained of.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In 
    my opinion, the cases to which the court was referred, such as <i>L’Attiboudeaire 
    v. Royal Bank</i> [<i>supra</i>] and <i>Shah v. Xerox Canada Ltd.</i> (2000) 
    O.J. 849 are ones in which the acts complained of were directed specifically 
    against the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I am of the 
    opinion that allegations alleging racist actions, or failure to take action, 
    or activities of any sort committed against nonparties to this action are 
    not relevant and ought not to be subject matter of the litigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> On the basis of <i>L’Attiboudeaire</i> he was prepared to let stand 
    only the claims based on discriminatory conduct specifically directed to the 
    plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was not prepared to 
    let stand the pleas of systemic discrimination which he considered to be actions 
    “… committed against nonparties to this action …”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The law is clear since the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Board 
    of Governors of Seneca College of Applied Arts &amp;Technology v. Bhadauria</i> 
    (1981), 124 D.L.R. (3d) 193 that no cause of action lies for breach of the 
    <i>Ontario Human Rights Code</i> or at common law based on an invocation of 
    the public policy expressed in the <i>Code</i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In this case as in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>L’Attiboudeaire</i> 
    the plaintiff had been in an employment relationship with the defendant. To 
    prove conduct on the part of the defendant which amounted to constructive 
    dismissal she does not need to invoke the policy of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Ontario Human Rights Code</i> or the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Canadian Human Rights Act.</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, 
    to quote from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>L’Attiboudeaire</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This does not mean that its terms could not be relevant 
    factors to take into account in assessing the defendant’s conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> For the purposes of pleading discriminatory conduct as a basis for 
    a wrongful dismissal claim I see no principled basis for distinguishing between 
    allegations of direct discrimination aimed at the plaintiff and allegations 
    of systemic racism which target a class or group of which the plaintiff is 
    a member.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In either case the allegation 
    is one of discrimination against the plaintiff offered to support the wrongful 
    dismissal claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> It is important I think to recognize the difficulty in proving allegations 
    of race discrimination by way of direct evidence.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As others have noted, rarely are there cases 
    where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The motions judge expressed concern that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… the plea as it stands would be a wholesale investigation 
    of all of the personnel files of the defendant …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I am satisfied that the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> and specifically 
    those which relate to the ability of the Defendant to require particulars, 
    and which govern the scope of both documentary and oral discovery are adequate 
    to meet any concerns about the breadth of these pleadings.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Further, the defendant always has the option 
    to move for a stay of the action on the basis that the Human Rights Commission 
    is the more appropriate forum in the particular circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In my view the motions judge erred in striking out paragraphs 17(i), 
    (ii) and the second sentence of paragraph 17(iv).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I would therefore allow the appeal and set 
    aside paragraph 1 of the motions judge’s order made October 3, 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant’s Bill of Costs on a partial indemnity basis totalled 
    $21,828.00 and the respondents $21,345.07.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In my view these amounts are much too high in an appeal of this 
    nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The time spent in relation 
    to the appeal was inordinate when one considers these same issues had already 
    been addressed before the motions judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I would fix costs to the appellant in the sum of $11,000.00 inclusive 
    of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
