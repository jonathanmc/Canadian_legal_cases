    and take up new jobs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The capital 
    they refer to is the value to employees of their seniority, benefits and job-specific 
    skills that accumulate with service.<span

    of the capital loss an employee suffers from the loss of employment as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Certain benefits

    job assignment, pension benefits, longer vacation periods and accumulated 
    sick leave are all fringe benefits which may result in significant loss if 
    the employee is forced to move from one job to another.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    pay only to those situations in which it is appropriate is a pressing and 
    substantial legislative objective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 
    Attorney General submits that the objective of the severance pay provisions 
    in the <i>Act </i>is to “ease the financial needs of those who lose their 
    jobs but who are likely to find alternative employment albeit at a reduced 
    compensation.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Attorney General

    </span> While I agree that the government is entitled to balance the interests 
    of employers and employees by limiting the availability of severance pay, 
    I am not convinced that this objective is sufficiently compelling to override 
    the right of disabled persons to equal treatment in employment. However, regardless 
    of my disposition of this issue, the appellant’s argument fails at the next 
    stage of the s. 1 analysis because there is no rational connection between 
    the objective of granting severance pay to those employees who will rejoin 
    the workforce and the law which denies severance pay to employees whose contracts 
    have been frustrated due to illness or injury.<span

    the contrary, the generalization that is offered as the rational connection 
    reflects a stereotypical presumption about the adaptability, industry, and

    generalization can only have the effect of perpetuating and even promoting 
    the view that disabled individuals are less capable and less worthy of recognition

    </span> Further, to the extent that severance pay is intended to ease the 
    transition of terminated employees to other employment, the need of disabled 
    employees for support in retraining and the acquisition of new skills may 
    be even more pressing than that of other terminated employees.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Denying them the benefit of severance pay therefore

    </span> Finally, s. 58(5)(c) does not impair the griever’s <i>Charter</i> 
    rights as minimally as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First, 
    to the extent that compensating terminated employees for their past contributions 
    to the employer’s business is one purpose of severance pay, employees who 
    are not likely to return to the workforce are entitled to be compensated for 
    their past contributions to the employer’s business in the same way as other 
    employees who receive severance pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    other government benefits as a result of their disabilities, this does not 
    minimize the extent to which their rights to equal treatment in employment 
    are impaired by the impugned law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, 
    to the extent that one purpose of severance pay is to provide assistance for 
    employees to rejoin the workforce, s. 58(5)(c) denies its benefits to all 
    persons whose contracts of employment have been frustrated due to disability 
    without regard to whether or not they attempt to rejoin the workforce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
