    </span> The appellant Lakeport Beverages has a unionized workforce. The respondent 
    Teamsters Local Union 938 represents the employees. Under the parties collective 
    agreement, employees who have completed their probationary period attain seniority, 
    which gives them significant rights and benefits. The collective agreement 
    also permits Lakeport to hire seasonal employees at lower wage rates and without 
    any of the benefits given to seniority employees. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>In the fall 
    of 2002, Lakeport laid-off sixty-eight seniority employees because of a downturn 
    in its business. In early 2003, it proposed to hire over seventy seasonal 
    employees to meet increased summer demand.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Lakeport told the union that it would recall seniority employees 
    before hiring new employees, but<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>proposed 
    to recall the laid-off seniority employees as seasonal employees and pay them 
    the seasonal employee wage rate. The union objected. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Lakeport filed 
    a policy grievance to resolve the dispute. Arbitrator Stephens concluded that 
    Lakeport would not violate the collective agreement by recalling seniority 
    employees as seasonal employees and paying them the lower wage rate. The union 
    applied to quash the award. The Divisional Court granted the application. 
    It held that the arbitrators interpretation of the collective agreement was 
    irrational, principally because the arbitrator mischaracterized seasonal 
    employee as an employment classification under the collective agreement when, 
    in fact, it was an employment status. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Lakeport appeals 
    with leave to this court. It raises two issues. First, is the applicable standard 
    of review of the arbitrators decision reasonableness or patent unreasonableness? 
    Second, on the applicable standard, did the Divisional Court err in quashing 
    the award? For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the applicable standard 
    is patent unreasonableness. I also conclude that the arbitrators decision 
    was patently unreasonable, and therefore the Divisional Court did not err 
    in quashing it. </span></p>

    a five-year collective agreement. This agreement governs the dispute between 
    the parties. </span></p>

    collective agreement, new employees at Lakeport must work a probationary period 
    of four hundred and eighty hours within a twelve-month period in order to 
    attain seniority. Seniority employees enjoy the full range of benefits under 
    the collective agreement, including entitlement to a comprehensive health 
    and welfare plan, the right to be recalled from layoff to perform available 
    work, the right to apply for posted jobs, the right to be disciplined or discharged

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Lakeports 
    business fluctuates during the year. To enable the company to respond to these 
    fluctuations, Article 20.02 of the collective agreement permits Lakeport to 
    hire seasonal employees during its busy seasons, which fall between April 
    1 and September 15, and between November 15 and December 31 each year. Typically, 
    seasonal employees are hired to work in positions that are already occupied 
    by seniority employees and that fall within classifications set out in the 
    collective agreement, such as<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>machine 
    operator,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>filler operator, or<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>brew house operator. Article 20.02 (b) expressly 
    provides that seasonal employees are not hired with the intent of becoming 
    seniority employees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>More significantly, 
    under the collective agreement, seasonal employees are not entitled to any 
    of the rights and benefits accorded seniority employees, and are paid wage 
    rates ranging from $7 and $14 per hour less than seniority employees, even 
    though they perform the same type of work.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>In the summer of 2002, for legitimate business 
    reasons, Lakeport did not hire seasonal employees. Seniority employees continued 
    to do all the companys work throughout the summer. In September 2002, however, 
    Lakeports business slowed down. It laid-off sixty-eight seniority employees.

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>In early 2003, 
    Lakeport announced that it would likely need to hire seventy-seven seasonal 
    employees to meet its anticipated increased summer demand. Lakeport told the 
    union that it proposed to recall the laid-off seniority employees before hiring 
    new employees, but that during the recall period it would treat these laid-off 
    employees as seasonal employees. The union objected. It contended that seniority 
    employees could not be recalled to be paid seasonal employee wage rates and 
    deprived of their rights under the collective agreement. </span></p>

    this dispute, in March 2003, Lakeport filed a policy grievance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It asked the arbitrator to resolve two issues. 
    First, because there was no available full-time work for laid-off employees, 
    could Lakeport recall laid-off full-time employees as seasonal employees, 
    and offer them the seasonal employee wage rate of $13 per hour?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Second, did the collective agreement allow 
    the company to hire seasonal employees, as contemplated by the collective 
    agreement, while there were full-time employees already on layoff?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>The first issue became the focus of the arbitration. 
    </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>C. The arbitrators decision</h4>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The arbitrator 
    gave his award in May 2003. On the first issue in the policy grievance, he 
    concluded that under the collective agreement Lakeport was entitled to recall 
    the laid-off seniority employees as seasonal employees at the seasonal employee 
    wage rate. In reaching this conclusion, the arbitrator made three important 
    findings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>First, and 
    critical to his decision, he rejected the unions argument that seasonal 
    employee was a type of employment status; instead, he found that it was a 
    separate employment classification. He held that Lakeport had the right to 
    classify employees under the management rights provision in the agreement 
    (Article 4.01), and that no other provision of the agreement precluded Lakeport 
    from defining classifications as it saw fit. Although Article 10 of the collective 
    agreement gave laid-off employees the right to be recalled, it did not stipulate 
    a right to recall to any specific classification or at any specific rate of 
    pay. Therefore the arbitrator held that Lakeport would not violate any provision 
    of the collective agreement by recalling seniority employees as seasonal employees 
    for the period between June and August 2003.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Second, the 
    arbitrator found that Lakeports proposal would not breach Article 20.02 of 
    the collective agreement because Lakeport did not intend that these seasonal 
    employees become seniority employees. Instead, they would be hired for the 
    summer period as stipulated in Article 20.02 (a).</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Third, the 
    arbitrator found no evidence of bad faith on the part of the employer. The 
    evidence showed that the sixty-eight employees in question had been laid-off 
    because of a downturn in the economy. However, the arbitrator noted that if 
    Lakeport were to engage in this practice every summer, its actions would raise 
    a possible violation of Article 20.02 (f), which provides that seasonal employees 
    shall not displace seniority or probationary employees.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The arbitrator 
    does not appear to have expressly considered the second issue in the policy 
    grievance: whether the collective agreement permits Lakeport to hire seasonal 
    employees while seniority employees are on layoff. In his award, however, 
    he seems to have accepted that Lakeport could do so. He noted that seasonal 
    employee positions could be created and posted at the employers discretion 
    so long as the conditions in Article 20.02 were met.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He also found that using seasonal employees 
    as Lakeport intended to do would not displace any seniority employees. This 
    was because, in the arbitrators view, displaced in Article 20.02 (f) means 
    removing a seniority employee from a position he or she currently occupies.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The arbitrator 
    summarized his findings in the following passage from his award: </span></p>
  <p>As a result, I find that the employer has a right to create positions within 
    the seasonal employee classification while seniority employees are laid-off, 
    and to pay employees in the positions, including any seniority rated employees 
    who are recalled to such positions, the wage rate of the seasonal employee 
    classification as set out in Article 20.01.</p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Nonetheless, 
    the arbitrator concluded by noting that he had made no finding on the interplay 
    between seniority rights and any other conditions of employment and more 
    specifically on how seniority rated employees in the seasonal employee classification 
    would be treated with respect to seniority, benefits, or other terms of employment 
    aside from wages. He therefore said that he remained seized of the matter 
    to deal with any issues arising out of the implementation of his decision.

    endorsement, the Divisional Court quashed the arbitrators award. The court 
    held that seasonal employee was a job status, not, as the arbitrator held, 
    a job classification. Moreover, as laid-off seniority employees have the right 
    to be recalled to perform available work, it could not have been the parties 
    intention that they be paid as seasonal employees during the busy time of 
    the year, absent express language to that effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    Under s. 48 (1) of Ontario<i>s Labour Relations Act</i>, S.O. 1995, c. 1, 
    his decision is final and binding. For many years, both the Supreme Court 
    of Canada and this court have held that where Ontario labour arbitrators are 
    called on to interpret provisions of a collective agreement their decisions 
    are reviewable on a standard of patent unreasonableness. See for example: 
    <i>Volvo Canada Ltd. v. International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace

    refused [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 646. Both courts have so held when there were 
    only two standards of review - correctness and patent unreasonableness - and 
    after the Supreme Courts decision in <i>Canada (Director of Investigation

    Union of Provincial Employees v. Lethbridge Community College,</i> [2004] 
    1 S.C.R. 727  the Supreme Court adopted a standard of reasonableness instead 
    of patent unreason-ableness for reviewing decisions of labour arbitrators

    In <i>Elementary</i> <i>Teachers</i> the Divisional Court held that the proper

    Writing for the court (at para. 13), Swinton J. read <i>Voice Construction</i>

    that the Alberta cases can be distinguished on the basis of the different

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The Alberta 
    cases reaffirmed - if reaffirmation were needed  that the overriding question 
    is the extent of judicial review that the legislature intended for a particular 
    decision of the administrative tribunal. The Alberta cases also reaffirmed 
    that to answer that question the court must invoke a pragmatic and functional 
    approach and apply the following four well-established contextual factors: 
    the presence or absence of a privative clause or a statutory right of appeal; 
    the expertise of the tribunal relative to the expertise of the reviewing court 
    on the questions at issue; the purpose of the legislation and of the particular 
    provision; and the nature of the question at issue. To determine the legislatures 
    intent, all four factors must be taken into account; no one factor is determinative.

style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The application of these four factors shows 
    a legislative intent to maintain a highly deferential standard of review of 
    Arbitrator Stephens decision. First, as has historically been the case in 
    Ontario, his decision is protected by a reasonably strong privative clause. 
    Section 48 (1) of the <i>Labour Relations Act, supra,</i> provides for final 
    and binding arbitration and the <i>Act</i> contains no express right of judicial 
    review or appeal. Although not a full privative clause, s. 48 (1) does signal 
    a large measure of deference to the arbitrators decision.<span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Second, the 
    interpretation of a provision of a collective agreement lies at the heart 
    of an arbitrators expertise, an expertise ordinarily greater than that of 
    courts. This factor, therefore, weighs heavily in favour of deference. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Third, the 
    purpose of s. 48 (1) of the Act - the grievance and arbitration provision 
    - is to secure the prompt, efficient and cost-effective settlement of disputes 
    arising out of an interpretation and application of a collective agreement. 
    This purpose can best be achieved with minimal interference from the courts. 
    The issue in this case is precisely the kind of issue that warrants minimal 
    interference. The arbitrator was required to interpret the relevant provision 
    of the collective agreement, and thus was required to decide a question squarely 
    within his jurisdiction. In <i>Toronto (City) Board of Education v. Ontario 
    Secondary School Teachers Federation, District 15,</i> [1997] 1 S.C.R. 487 
    at paras. 35-7, Cory J. emphasized the reasons why a highly deferential standard 
    of review should be applied to an arbitrators interpretation of the provisions 
    of a collective agreement: </span></p>
  <p>The field of labour relations is sensitive and volatile. It is essential 
    that there be a means of providing speedy decisions by experts in the field 
    who are sensitive to the situation, and which can be considered by both sides 
    to be final and binding. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>In particular, it has been held that the whole 
    purpose of a system of grievance arbitration is to secure prompt, final and 
    binding settlement of disputes arising out of the interpretation or application 
    of collective agreements. . . This is a basic requirement for peace in industrial 
    relations, which is important to the parties and society as a whole. . . </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>It was for these reasons that <i>PSAC No. 2</i> 
    stressed that decisions of labour tribunals acting within their jurisdiction 
    can only be set aside if they are patently unreasonable. That is very properly 
    an extremely high standard, and there must not be any retreat from this position.

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Finally, the 
    nature of the question in issue in this case points to a highly deferential 
    standard of review. Here, the arbitrator was required to apply his interpretation 
    of the provisions of the collective agreement to the facts of this case. His 
    decision has little precedential value. It did not require him to determine 
    a question of law or fact going to his jurisdiction, a question of law or 
    fact concerning the interpretation of an external statute, or a general question 
    of law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>What then 
    of the Alberta cases? I think that they are largely explained by the relatively 
    weak privative clause in the Alberta statute. Section 142 of the Alberta <i>Labour 
    Relations Code</i> states merely that an arbitrators decision is binding, 
    and s. 143(2) expressly stipulates that an arbitrators decision is open to 
    judicial review if notice is filed with the court within thirty days after 
    the date of the award. By contrast, although the final and binding clause 
    in s. 48 (1) of the Ontario statute is not the strongest privative clause 
    imaginable, it does provide more protection than its counterpart in s. 142 
    of the Alberta<i> Code</i>. And the Ontario <i>Act</i> has no provisions comparable 
    to s. 143(2) of the Alberta <i>Code</i> expressly permitting judicial review.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>I conclude 
    that the Supreme Courts decisions in <i>Voice Construction </i>and<i> Lethbridge 
    Community College</i> do not alter the standard of review applicable to the 
    arbitrators decision in this case. The standard remains patent unreasonableness. 
    In my view, until we have a clear statement from the Supreme Court of Canada, 
    we should not depart from a highly deferential standard of review of decisions 
    of Ontario labour arbitrators  a standard of review that harkens back to 
    Dickson J.s seminal decision in <i>Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 
    963 v. New Brunswick Liquor Corp</i>., [1979] 2 S.C.R. 227, and that has served 
    the labour relations community in this province so well for over a quarter 
    of a century. </span></p>

    in this conclusion by the similar views of David Mullan, one of the countrys 
    pre-eminent administrative law scholars. Professor Mullan has recently written 
    that it would be premature to lament the passing of an era of deference. 
    More particularly, he wrote,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I 
    believe that that cannot be justified at least until such time as the Court 
    applies a reasonableness standard of review to the interpretation of a collective

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The principal 
    issue before the arbitrator was the first issue in the policy grievance, whether 
    Lakeport could recall laid-off seniority employees as seasonal employees and 
    pay them the seasonal employee wage rate of $13 per hour. Indeed, the union 
    says that this was the only issue before the arbitrator because on the second 
    issue  whether under the collective agreement the company could hire seasonal 
    employees while seniority employees were on layoff<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span> Lakeport had agreed that seniority employees were entitled to be 
    recalled when there was work available. The unions view of the focus of the 
    grievance is supported by the tenor of the arbitrators award and by the Divisional 
    Courts endorsement. I too will focus on this first issue in the grievance, 
    but will also comment briefly on the second issue.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Lakeport submits 
    that although the arbitrators interpretation of the collective agreement 
    may have been unpalatable to the union, it was not patently unreasonable. 
    Article 20.01 of the agreement, Lakeport argues, expressly provides that seasonal 
    employee is a classification.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The arbitrator therefore adopted a reasonable 
    interpretation of the collective agreement by holding that seasonal employee 
    is a job classification, and that the management rights clause does not restrict 
    the employers right to classify employees.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lakeport submits that in quashing the award, 
    the Divisional Court erroneously substituted its opinion for that of the arbitrator 
    and ignored the plain language of the collective agreement. </span></p>

lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>I cannot accept 
    Lakeports submission. In my view, the arbitrator mischaracterized seasonal 
    employee as a job classification and effectively rewrote Article 20 to do 
    so. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>He also ignored other provisions 
    of the collective agreement and paid lip service to the importance of seniority. 
    Because of these errors in interpreting the agreement, the arbitrator produced 
    a result that borders on the absurd. It is thus patently unreasonable. </span></p>

    </span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>As I have said, the 
    critical finding of the arbitrator on which his award rested was his conclusion 
    that seasonal employee is an employment classification. Because a laid-off 
    employee has no right to be recalled to any particular classification, the 
    arbitrator held that a seniority employee could be recalled to work as a seasonal 
    employee in the same way that, for example, a machine operator could be 
    recalled to work as a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>stationary 
    engineer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In so holding, the arbitrator 
    relied on Article 20, titled,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wage 
    Rates and Classifications, and on the accompanying chart in Article 20.01.

    example, a machine operator or a stationary engineer, because seasonal 
    employees are hired to do the job of a machine operator or a stationary engineer. 
    The title in the chart may lend a superficial plausibility to the arbitrators

    that seniority employees cannot be recalled as seasonal employees. In holding 
    otherwise, the arbitrator interpreted parts of Article 20.02 contrary to its

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Further, relying 
    on Article 20.02 (b), the arbitrator held that in recalling the laid-off seniority 
    employees as seasonal employees, there is no intention that such employees 
    will become seniority employees. This holding makes no sense because the 
    laid-off employees already were seniority employees. Indeed, Article 20.02 
    (b) emphasizes that the parties never contemplated, much less agreed, that 
    recalled seniority employees could be reclassified as seasonal employees.

    Article 20.02 (c) and (d) stipulate that seasonal employees are not entitled 
    to the benefits given to seniority employees under the collective agreement. 
    These provisions reinforce the conclusion that employees who have already 
    attained seniority and already have rights and benefits under the collective 
    agreement do not fit the concept of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>seasonal

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The arbitrator 
    appears to have ignored Article 20.02 (c) and (d), because while he allowed 
    Lakeport to recall seniority employees at the seasonal employee wage rate, 
    he remained seized of issues that may arise pertaining to seniority or other 
    benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Article 20.02 (c) and (d), 
    however, stipulates that not only are seasonal employees to be paid at a lower 
    wage rate, they are not entitled to any other rights or benefits under the 
    collective agreement. In short, on the arbitrators interpretation of the 
    collective agreement, there was nothing for him to remain seized of, because 
    once the seniority employees were recalled as seasonal employees, they had 
    no seniority or benefits to protect. </span></p>

    </span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The arbitrator also 
    appears to have rewritten Article 20.02 (e), which gives seasonal employees 
    an opportunity to become full-time employees once they have completed four 
    hundred and eighty hours of work in the year. In that case, a seasonal employee 
    need not work a probationary period. This subsection cannot possibly apply 
    to seniority employees, because by definition they have already worked the 
    probationary period of four hundred and eighty hours within a year. To reach 
    the arbitrators result requires rewriting Article 20.02 (e) to read, In 
    that circumstance the employee will not have to complete. . .a <i><u>second</u></i> 
    probationary period</span><span style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'>. .<span

    holding that Lakeport had the right to recall laid-off seniority employees 
    as seasonal employees, the arbitrator seemed to rely on Article 20.02(f), 
    which precludes seasonal employees from displacing seniority employees. However, 
    Article 20.02 (f) does not confer rights; it merely limits Lakeports right 
    to hire seasonal employees. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Overall, Article 
    20.02 demonstrates that seasonal employee is an employment status, not an 
    employment classification, and that laid-off seniority employees cannot be 
    recalled as seasonal employees. Unquestionably, laid-off seniority employees 
    could be recalled to a different job classification and paid the rate corresponding 
    to that classification. For example, a brewhouse operator paid $22.15 an hour 
    before being laid-off could be recalled to the classification of filler operator 
    and paid $21.90 an hour. But this does not have the effect of transforming 
    the employees job status and depriving that employee of previously acquired 
    collective agreement rights. The arbitrators inter-pretation does not merely 
    change a seniority employees job classification. It takes away all the rights 
    he or she acquired under the collective agreement.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>If the arbitrator 
    was correct in holding that seasonal employee is an employment classification 
    then so too is probationary employee. And yet that would mean seniority employees 
    could be recalled to fill positions in a probationary classification even 
    though they had already passed their probationary period and the parties had 
    never before treated probationary employees as a classification. Respectfully, 
    this would be an absurd result.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>It is not 
    just Article 20.02 that undermines the arbitrators characterization of seasonal 
    employee as a job classification; other provisions of the agreement do so 
    as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The agreement should be looked 
    at as a whole. And yet the arbitrator appears not to have considered other 
    relevant articles, especially Articles 8 and 9.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Article 8 
    addresses seniority and gives employees who have completed their probationary 
    period seniority rights from the date of hire. Under the arbitrators decision, 
    recalled seniority employees lose their seniority rights. He has thus effectively 
    read Article 8 out of the agreement. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>As I have 
    noted, Article 9 deals with the termination of seniority. Article 9.01, which 
    I have already reproduced, does not give the employer the authority to terminate 
    an employees seniority by reclassifying the employee as a seasonal employee. 
    The arbitrators decision effectively rewrote Article 9.01 to create an additional 
    circumstance in which seniority may be terminated. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Finally, although 
    in his decision the arbitrator referred to the importance of seniority, in 
    my respectful view he paid no more than lip service to it. Seniority, of course, 
    is vital to employees, a cornerstone of the collective bargaining relationship. 
    A long-established principle of labour law is that seniority can only be affected 
    or altered by express language in the agreement. Arbitrator Reville put it 
    this way in <i>Re United Electrical Workers, Local 512, and Tung-Sol of Canada 
    Ltd. </i>(1964), 15 L.A.C. 161 at 162:</span></p>
  <p>Seniority is one of the most important and far-reaching benefits which the 
    trade union has been able to secure for its members by virtue of the collective 
    bargaining process. An employees seniority under the terms of a collective 
    agreement gives rise to such important rights as relief from lay-off, right 
    to recall to employment, vacations and vacation pay, and pension rights, to 
    name only a few. <u>It follows, therefore, that an employees seniority should 
    only be affected by very clear language in the collective agreement concerned 
    and that arbitrators should construe the collective agreement with the utmost 
    strictness wherever it is contended that an employees seniority has been 
    forfeited, truncated or abridged under the relevant sections of the collective 
    agreement</u> [emphasis added]. </p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>In the light of this 
    principle, Lakeport cannot rely on its general authority in the management 
    rights clause to deprive seniority employees of the rights they have already 
    attained. Express language, not just the general management rights clause, 
    would be required to alter their seniority status. No such language can be 
    found in this collective agreement.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>In summary, the arbitrators 
    decision permits Lakeport to recall seniority employees and classify them 
    as seasonal employees. Thus the decision permits Lakeport to convert seniority 
    employees with collective agreement rights into seasonal employees with no 
    rights. These seniority employees would be recalled to perform work they had 
    performed before their lay off, yet paid $7-$14 per hour less to do so, and 
    without any of the rights and benefits they had acquired under the collective 
    agreement. The Divisional Court concluded that this was an irrational interpretation 
    of the collective agreement. I agree. This is not a case where the arbitrator 
    chose between two reasonable interpretations of the collective agreement. 
    Even on a highly deferential standard of review, the arbitrators decision 
    on this first issue cannot stand. It is patently unreasonable to interpret 
    the collective agreement to permit Lakeport to recall laid-off seniority employees 
    as seasonal employees. </span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>I turn briefly to 
    the second issue in the policy grievance: whether Lakeport was entitled to 
    hire seasonal employees while seniority employees were laid-off. Lakeport 
    submits that the arbitrator answered this question affirmatively and that 
    his answer is not patently unreasonable. Indeed, Lakeport submits that the 
    only limit in the collective agreement on its right to hire seasonal employees 
    during the two specified periods is found in Article 20.02 (f): seasonal 
    employees shall not displace seniority or probationary employees.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lakeport argues that the arbitrators interpretation 
    of displace to refer only to active employees, not to laid-off employees, 
    was reasonable.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>I suspect that the 
    union is correct in asserting that the second issue was not a live issue 
    before the arbitrator or in the Divisional Court. Both sets of reasons seem 
    to assume that if work were available, seniority employees would be recalled, 
    leaving only the question whether they would be recalled as seniority employees 
    or seasonal employees.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>However, even 
    if the second issue had been a live issue before the arbitrator, his narrow 
    interpretation of displace to refer only to seniority employees actively 
    working at Lakeport seems to make little sense. Lakeports workforce is seniority 
    rated, and laid-off seniority employees still have an employment relationship 
    with Lakeport. Hiring seasonal employees to the prejudice of laid-off seniority 
    employees amounts to displacing these seniority employees. I agree with the 
    union that Lakeport could hire seasonal employees while there were laid-off 
    seniority employees only if these laid-off employees had been recalled and 
    failed to report to work in accordance with Article 9.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>CONCLUSION</h4>
  <p style='line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>In my view, the collective 
    agreement does not permit Lakeport to recall seniority employees as seasonal 
    employees. The arbitrators interpretation of the agreement, permitting it 
    to do so, was patently unreasonable. I would therefore dismiss the appeal. 
    The union is entitled to its costs of the appeal, which I would fix in the 
    amount agreed on by counsel, $15,000 inclusive of the motion for leave to 
    appeal and of disbursements and GST.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span></span></p>
