    appellants were committed to stand trial by Forsyth J. of the Ontario Court 
    of Justice for the first degree murder of Matthew Daly.<span

    for <i>certiorari</i> before Durno R.S.J. of the Superior Court of Justice 
    to quash their committals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They sought

    judge had committed two types of jurisdictional error:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(1) by denying natural justice occasioned by 
    the failure to hear submissions on a legal issue, i.e. the significance of 
    the post-offence conduct evidence; and (2) by committing the appellants to 
    stand trial on the charge of first degree murder in the absence of any evidence 
    to support a committal for any offence beyond manslaughter. The reviewing 
    judge held that with respect to the first jurisdictional issue, the preliminary 
    inquiry judge had committed a jurisdictional error through a denial of natural 
    justice but nonetheless dismissed the application on the basis that the appellants 
    had suffered no prejudice thereby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He 
    upheld the order that each of the appellants stand trial for first degree 
    murder as he found that there was some evidence upon which the preliminary 
    inquiry judge could have reasonably concluded that the sufficiency test had 
    been met.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

    stand trial for manslaughter or second degree murder, or alternatively, that 
    the matter be remitted back to the committing judge for reconsideration of 
    the issue of committal after full submissions in respect of the post-offence 
    conduct evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>[<i>A portion of

    </span> The answer to this apparent anomaly lies in the nature and scope of 
    the authority of the superior court as a court of general jurisdiction and 
    the inherent jurisdiction that is a component of the broad powers accompanying 
    the general jurisdiction authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In an article entitled, “The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court”, 
    (1970) 23 <i>Current Legal Problems </i>23, I.H. Jacob describes the inherent 
    jurisdiction of a superior court in the following terms (at pp. 51-52):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In this light, the inherent jurisdiction 
    of the court may be defined as being the reserve or fund of powers, a residual 
    source of powers, which the court may draw upon as necessary whenever it is 
    just or equitable to do so, and in particular to ensure the observance of 
    the due process of law, to prevent improper vexation or oppression, to do 
    justice between the parties and to secure a fair trial between them. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It may be objected that this view of 
    the nature of the inherent jurisdiction of the court postulates the existence 
    of an amplitude of amorphous powers, which may be arbitrary in operation and 
    which are without limit in extent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 
    answer is that a jurisdiction of this kind and character is a necessary part 
    of the armoury of the courts to enable them to administer justice according 
    to law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The inherent jurisdiction 
    of the court is a virile and viable doctrine which in the very nature of things 
    is bound to be claimed by the superior courts of law as an indispensable adjunct 
    to all their other powers, and . . . it operates as a valuable weapon in the 
    hands of the court to prevent any clogging or obstruction of the stream of 
    justice.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> This jurisdiction, in our view, empowers the reviewing judge to exercise 
    a “proviso-like” discretion to refuse to quash a committal where the accused 
    has suffered no prejudice because the committal would otherwise have been 
    inevitable, even where there has been a denial of natural justice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>In this case, the reviewing judge declined to grant the extraordinary 
    relief of <i>certiorari </i>because the alleged error ultimately made no difference.</p>

    </span> The decision whether to grant or not to grant a prerogative remedy 
    is ultimately a matter of discretion, exercised by the superior court as part 
    of its general and inherent jurisdiction: <i>R. v. Nat Bell Liquors Ltd.</i> 
    (1922), 37 C.C.C. 129 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Workmen’s Compensation Board Ex parte 
    Kuzyk</i>, [1968] 2 O.R. 337, (C.A.); and <i>Re Krawkowski and the Queen</i> 
    (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 188 (S.C.C.).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While 
    this authority must be exercised in accordance with established principles, 
    there are cases where the court has exercised its jurisdiction not to award 
    the remedy whether or not there was jurisdictional error – e.g., where there 
    has been unnecessary delay in applying for the writ, or where the applicant 
    has not acted in good faith in seeking the order: see for example, <i>Young 
    v. Attorney-General of Manitoba, Boxall and Fryer</i> (1960), 129 C.C.C. 110 
    (Man. C.A.) and <i>Krawkowski, supra</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>In general, where the legal grounds for quashing a committal are made 
    out, the writ will issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is 
    so, “unless”, as Sir Wilfred Greene M.R. noted in <i>R.&nbsp;v. Stafford Justices 
    Ex parte Stafford Corp.</i>, [1940] 2 K.B. 33 at 44, “there is something in 
    the circumstances of the case which make it right to refuse the relief sought.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    </span> We see no reason in principle why, if the discretion may be exercised 
    to refuse a prerogative remedy in the face of jurisdictional error in some 
    circumstances – such as those referred to above – it may not be exercised

    approach in <i>Cardinal</i> by accepting that there are rare circumstances 
    in which the court may exercise its discretion and not grant a remedy for 
    a breach of procedural fairness where the result is otherwise inevitable (see 
    paras. 52-54).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This approach was acknowledged 
    by Rothstein&nbsp;J.A. in <i>Gale </i>at para. 13, although in the circumstances

    that there had been a breach of procedural fairness; the court concluded that
