  <h1><span lang=EN-US>A. OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>The 
    transaction giving rise to these two appeals took place in Pembroke in 1988.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>William 
    Morglan, the owner of Upper Valley Dodge Chrysler Limited, agreed to loan 
    $160,000 to Marcel Cronier Trucking Limited at an interest rate of 14 per 
    cent per annum. As security for the loan, Cronier Trucking gave a chattel 
    mortgage against the equipment it owned and a mortgage against real property 
    which was owned by Marcel Cronier and his wife, Jacqueline Cronier, and which 
    included the matrimonial home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The purpose 
    of the loan was to consolidate a $90,000 debt already owing by Cronier Trucking 
    to Upper Valley and various debts to other creditors, and to assist in financing 
    a potentially lucrative federal government contract Cronier Trucking had obtained.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The respondent 
    law firm acted on both sides of the transaction. The senior partner, Allan 
    Huckabone, acted for Upper Valley and Morglan who had been clients of his 
    for many years. Another partner in the firm, Grant Radley-Walters, acted for 
    the Cronier interests, as he had done for the previous decade.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The loan 
    soon went into default. However, no doubt at least in part because of the 
    long personal relationship between Morglan and Marcel Cronier, Upper Valley 
    did not begin this litigation until 1998, a year after Marcel Cronier had 
    died. Initially, Upper Valley sued only the Cronier defendants. Its claim 
    was based on default in its two pieces of security: the chattel mortgage and 
    the real property mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>The 
    Cronier defendants delivered a statement of defence. In the statement of defence, 
    Jacqueline Cronier pleaded unconscionability, undue influence, and non est 
    factum. She alleged that she did not receive independent legal advice before 
    signing the mortgage and that neither the mortgage nor the risk of signing 
    it was explained to her. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Jacqueline 
    Cronier’s defence prompted Upper Valley to amend its statement of claim and 
    to sue the respondent law firm and Huckabone. It alleged that Huckabone and 
    the law firm were negligent and in breach of their fiduciary duty in failing 
    to ensure that Jacqueline Cronier had independent legal advice and that she 
    understood the nature of the mortgage she was signing. In turn, the Cronier 
    defendants amended their statement of defence to assert a cross-claim against 
    the law firm, essentially making the same allegations against the firm as 
    had Upper Valley.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> By judgment 
    dated May 27, 2004, Maranger J. ordered the Cronier defendants to pay Upper 
    Valley the sum of $296,551.78, inclusive of pre-judgment interest. However, 
    he dismissed both the claim and the cross-claim against Huckabone and the 
    law firm. It is from these dismissals that Upper Valley and the Cronier defendants 
    appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Upper Valley submits that by acting on both sides of this loan transaction, 
    the law firm put itself in a position of irreconcilable conflict. On this 
    ground alone, Upper Valley argues, it is entitled to judgment against the 
    law firm for the amount of its loan. We do not agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge considered but rejected Upper Valley’s claim that 
    the law firm had put itself in a position of conflict. Instead, he concluded 
    that no conflict arose largely because the two parties, Morglan and Cronier, 
    had agreed on the terms of the transaction before they sought legal advice. 
    They had gone to Huckabone and Radley-Walters simply to “paper” the transaction. 
    In the trial judge’s words at para. 42 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view the examination of this issue has to 
    be considered in its proper context. This matter occurred in a small Town 
    in 1988. The lawyers involved had represented each client for a number of 
    years. It was accepted practise in this community to act on both sides of 
    a transaction of this type. This transaction was not a complex matter. The 
    lawyers were not cognisant of an old account of the Croniers when rendering 
    the services. The parties to this loan were not in a situation of conflict 
    at the time the deal was closed. The terms of the security being provided 
    were not negotiable. The house was either mortgaged or there was no loan. 
    It became a condition precedent. By the time Allan Huckabone was retained 
    it was not a situation of conflict but simply the implementation of an agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Lawyers and law firms must, of course, be wary of acting on both sides 
    of a transaction. The law reports contain many cases where acting on both 
    sides gives rise to a disqualifying conflict of interest. However, we think 
    that on the record before him, it was open to the trial judge to find that 
    no conflict arose requiring separate representation. We therefore decline 
    to interfere with it.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>2. Failure 
    to advise of the real risk </span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Jacqueline Cronier was required to sign the mortgage on the real property, 
    which was being given as partial security for the loan. Therefore, Huckabone 
    properly advised his client Morglan that he should not advance the funds unless 
    Jacqueline Cronier obtained independent legal advice. Morglan rejected his 
    lawyer’s advice. The trial judge accepted Huckabone’s evidence – which was 
    supported by his contemporaneous notes – that Morglan said he would take his 
    chances in court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> On appeal, Upper Valley argues that Huckabone understated the real 
    risk in proceeding without ensuring that Jacqueline Cronier had independent 
    legal advice. Apparently Huckabone thought that the mortgage being given by 
    Marcel and Jacqueline Cronier covered only the lot on which their home was 
    located. In fact, this lot was contiguous to three other lots owned by the 
    Croniers, which they used for various other purposes. The mortgage had to 
    be given, and was given, over all four lots, not just the lot on which the 
    house was situated. Huckabone knew the true state of the title before closing, 
    but apparently did not advise Morglan of any change in the risk of proceeding 
    without independent legal advice for Jacqueline Cronier.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> We do not think that any further advice would have deterred Morglan 
    from proceeding with the transaction. The evidence is overwhelming that he 
    wanted to advance the money, principally because he would become a secured 
    instead of an unsecured creditor. Moreover, the principal security he was 
    looking to in order to protect his loan was not the real property mortgage 
    but the chattel mortgage over the equipment. Upper Valley’s argument must 
    therefore fail on the issue of causation.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>3. Compound

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge rejected Upper Valley’s claim for compound interest, 
    and reduced the 14 per cent interest rate under the loan to the rate provided 
    in the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>. He did so for two reasons: Upper Valley’s 
    delay in bringing the action, a delay he considered “commercially unreasonable,” 
    and Upper Valley’s failure to provide a proper accounting over the years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> On appeal, Upper Valley contends that the trial judge erred in failing 
    to award compound interest. We do not accept this contention. The loan went 
    into default nine months after it was made, yet Morglan took no action to 
    collect the debt for nine years, all the while letting interest accumulate 
    at 14 per cent per annum. We think that it was within the trial judge’s discretion 
    to make the interest award that he did. Accordingly, we decline to give effect 
    to this ground of appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge ordered Upper Valley to pay the law firm its costs 
    of the trial on a partial indemnity basis. He rejected Upper Valley’s arguments 
    that it was reasonable to add the law firm as a defendant and that therefore 
    it should not pay the law firm’s costs. Upper Valley renews this argument 
    on appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span

    </span> The trial judge recognized the validity of Upper Valley’s arguments, 
    but concluded that “they do not displace the more important consideration 
    of the result achieved at the end of this trial.” This was a proper exercise 
    of the trial judge’s discretion on costs. We see no basis to interfere with 
    it. Thus this ground of appeal also fails. </p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Both Jacqueline 
    Cronier’s mental health and her illiteracy were issues at trial. Her counsel 
    advanced defences of non est factum, unconscionability, and ineffective legal 
    representation. The trial judge did not give effect to any of these defences.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>On the basis 
    of expert and other evidence, he found that Mrs. Cronier had “the requisite 
    mental capacity” to execute the mortgage documents and thus he rejected her 
    plea of non est factum. He found that there was nothing unfair about the loan 
    transaction. In doing so, he noted that a 14 per cent interest rate from a 
    private lender in 1988 was “within the realm of reasonable.” Finally, the 
    trial judge found that Grant Radley-Walters was a meticulous solicitor, and 
    that he both carefully explained the mortgage to Mrs. Cronier and recommended 
    she obtain independent legal advice. She, however, refused to do so. Although 
    Mrs. Cronier challenged these findings on appeal, they are well supported 
    by the record and we defer to them. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Jacqueline 
    Cronier’s principal argument on appeal is that the trial judge erred in failing 
    to hold that she should not be held liable on the mortgage because the law 
    firm failed to insist on her obtaining independent legal advice. In other 
    words, she contends that hers was a case where it was not enough for the law 
    firm to advise her to obtain independent legal advice; it had to insist and 
    ensure that she do so.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Jacqueline 
    Cronier did not want to give a mortgage as security for the loan. Her husband 
    could have sold the equipment that the trucking company owned and dispensed 
    with the need for a loan altogether, but he was unwilling to do so. On the 
    other hand, Upper Valley would not advance the money without the security 
    of both a chattel mortgage and a real property mortgage. Mrs. Cronier eventually 
    capitulated and signed the mortgage.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Although it 
    obviously would have been better had Jacqueline Cronier obtained independent 
    legal advice before signing the mortgage, on the basis of the trial judge’s 
    findings of fact and the record before us, we are persuaded that even if she 
    did obtain independent legal advice she would have nonetheless signed the 
    mortgage so that her husband and his company could obtain the loan. Thus this 
    argument must fail, as did Upper Valley’s principal argument, on the issue 
    of causation.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>The trial 
    judge recognized the desirability that Jacqueline Cronier obtain independent 
    legal advice. As he said, “I have little difficulty in agreeing with the view 
    of both experts, that ideally Mrs. Jacqueline Cronier should have received 
    independent legal advice.” However, he then considered whether her doing so 
    would have made a difference. He concluded that it would have made no difference. 
    Even if she had obtained independent legal advice she would have gone through 
    with the loan. The loan benefited her family and the family’s livelihood. 
    It allowed the family’s debts to be consolidated, and it provided extra money 
    for the federal government contract. In short, the loan was a significant 
    benefit, not just to Mr. Cronier but also to Mrs. Cronier. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>In the following 
    paragraph of the trail judge’s reasons, he sets out his important findings 
    on this issue:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>In 
    this case, Mrs. Jacqueline Cronier needed this loan. She received a direct 
    benefit. Mrs. Cronier and Mr. Cronier <u>both</u> owed Upper Valley Dodge 
    Chrysler Limited about $90,000.00. The mortgage loan was, in part, being obtained 
    to retire that debt. A series of creditors were demanding payment. Grant Radley-Walters 
    successfully used rapid repayment as a tool to reduce the total obligation. 
    Furthermore, the loan in question was also to obtain financing in order to 
    obtain a contract for the family-run business. The evidence was clear that 
    Mrs. Cronier derived a livelihood together with her husband and their daughter 
    from the Cronier family business. Although, she did not have a direct interest 
    in the business (i.e. she did not co-own the business with her husband) she 
    was nonetheless involved in its day-to-day operation. This is not a case of 
    someone putting up their house for someone else’s clearly foolhardy loan, 
    this is a case where the individual in question had a vested interest<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>in obtaining a loan to consolidate and potentially reduce an overwhelming 
    debt load. It is more probable than not that Mrs. Cronier would have gone 
    through with this loan even with the benefit of independent legal advice.

lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>These findings 
    are unassailable on the record. So too is the trial judge’s companion finding 
    that Jacqueline Cronier failed to make out undue influence. We therefore do 
    not give effect to her principal ground of appeal.</span></p>
