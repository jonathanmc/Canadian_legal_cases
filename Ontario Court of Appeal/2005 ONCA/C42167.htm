  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Matrix Contractors &amp; Building Services Inc. (“Matrix”) appeals 
    from the judgment of J.G. Quinn J., which dismissed Matrix’s action against 
    National Bank of Canada (“the Bank”). Although, according to the Notice of 
    Appeal, Business Ventures Inc. (“B.V.I.”) also appealed, that appeal has since 
    been abandoned and is dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Matrix's action against the Bank was framed in misrepresentation, 
    breach of trust, deceit, and unjust enrichment. Matrix contracted to renovate 
    space in a strip mall owned by Latif Inc. (“Latif”). Latif required the renovations, 
    which were to cost an estimated $150,000, to accommodate Bi-Way, its proposed 
    anchor tenant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Matrix argued that it relied on a representation by the Bank that 
    the Bank would advance the $150,000 to Latif to pay Matrix for its work. The 
    Bank never made the advance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When 
    Matrix was unable to collect from Latif, it sued the Bank. At trial, the Bank 
    took the position that the Bank never intended to advance further funds to 
    this project for renovations or for any other purpose and that it made no 
    representations to Matrix that it would make the advance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The trial judge found, to the contrary, that the Bank did represent 
    to Matrix that the renovation loan would be advanced to Latif. However, the 
    trial judge also found that the Bank told Matrix that the loan was conditional 
    upon the Bank obtaining a guarantor's signature for the loan and that the 
    Bank had therefore not misrepresented its position to Matrix. Accordingly, 
    on that basis alone, he<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>concluded 
    that Matrix had failed to make out a case against the Bank for either fraudulent 
    or negligent misrepresentation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Although the trial judge accepted the appellant's evidence, he characterized 
    the Bank representation as one that may have &quot;under emphasized the [need 
    for the] guarantor's approval&quot;. However, the trial judge accepted the 
    evidence of Gary Anderson who testified on behalf of Matrix, that the Bank 
    never made any mention of any guarantor to Matrix. The trial judge summarized 
    Anderson’s evidence about the representations as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> 1. <span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Prior to the construction contract 
    being signed, Anderson, Jankowski and Arabo were in B.V.I.’s offices. Jankowski 
    and Arabo spoke to either Murphy or Widdifield. Gary Anderson testified that 
    while he has no first hand knowledge of what was said on the phone, it was 
    his understanding that the financing was going forth and the bank had given 
    its assurance to proceed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> 2. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">     </span>The day after the telephone call referred<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>to above, Gary Anderson went to the defendant’s premises on Ouellette 
    Avenue in Windsor. Mr. Anderson met Mr. Widdifield and Mr. Widdifield told 
    Mr. Anderson: “. . . I was correct in my understanding of the financing. The 
    i’s were dotted, the application had been the made, the i’s were dotted, the 
    t’s were crossed, they were however waiting on one signature but don’t lose 
    that tenant, it makes the plaza or something of those terms.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> 3. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">      </span>On the day the contract was signed, April 
    12, 1999, Anderson, Jankowski and Arabo were again in B.V.I.’s offices and 
    a telephone call was placed to the defendant bank. Anderson did not speak 
    to the bank’s representative but understood similar assurances were given 
    as in number 1 above. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;mso-list:none'>4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">    </span>After 
    the renovation work had started and the first invoice was sent to Latif Inc., 
    Gary Anderson telephoned Eric Widdifield. Gary Anderson testified: “. . . 
    he seemed a bit more evasive, but the essence of his statements were somewhat 
    parallel to what he had told me at this, as you deem it, the cigarette meeting 
    whereby he’s saying he’s still waiting for a signature. And I said, ‘You know, 
    I thought that signature was coming a week and a half to two weeks ago, and 
    maybe even a week and a half prior to that’, from what his, you know, what 
    I understood. And he said, well, he reinforced the fact that this gentleman 
    was from out of town, he traveled a lot, but you know, and again he kind of 
    shyed away.’”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Given this evidence, in our view, in otherwise careful reasons, the 
    trial judge misapprehended the evidence about the required signature. On the 
    evidence, the Bank told Matrix that the Bank was only waiting for one further 
    signature; that the Bank had been in frequent contact with the signatory; 
    and that the signature would be forthcoming at any time as soon as the signatory 
    returned from his travels. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> That the Bank represented that that signature was a mere formality 
    is the only inference reasonably to be taken from its statement to Matrix, 
    in the only direct meeting between Anderson and the Bank’s representative, 
    that all the &quot;i's&quot; were dotted and that all the &quot;t’s” were 
    crossed with respect to the loan. There is a significant difference between 
    needing the signature of a guarantor not yet requested and awaiting the formality 
    of a signature of a person who has already agreed to sign. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In considering Anderson's evidence, particularly his evidence about 
    the direct discussion, the trial judge commented that Anderson &quot;only 
    had one reason to meet with [the Bank's employee] and that was to receive 
    assurances that funding was in place. Gary Anderson had a clear and specific 
    recollection of the conversation.&quot; Further, the Bank had reason to give 
    that assurance. It considered the outstanding loan on the mall to be in jeopardy; 
    it was very much in the Bank's interest for Matrix to proceed with the renovations, 
    which would secure the necessary anchor tenant for the mall. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In addition to Anderson’s evidence, the trial judge considered the 
    evidence of Rabah Arabo, a principal shareholder of Latif. Arabo’s evidence 
    supported Anderson’s recollection. Thus, the trial judge determined that the 
    &quot;evidence referred to above of Gary Anderson and Rabah Arabo captures 
    the essence of the representations.&quot;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> There was no evidence that Arabo told Anderson of any need for a guarantor's 
    signature before Matrix signed the renovation contract and began the work. 
    Indeed, Arabo’s evidence was that the Bank only informed him of its requirement 
    for the guarantor's signature after Matrix had completed much of the renovations. 
    Only then, it seems, did the Bank consider the loan, process the application 
    through the Bank channels, and contact the guarantor – who, according to the 
    Bank, then refused to sign. Accordingly, the trial judge erred in attributing 
    Arabo’s later knowledge about the need for a guarantor’s signature to Matrix 
    at the time it entered into the contract and began the renovations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> When the Bank represented to Matrix that the loan was, in effect, 
    a sure thing, it not only knew this was untrue, but that Matrix would rely 
    on that representation. As the trial judge said in his reasons on costs dated 
    February 8, 2005, the Bank’s representations &quot;were instrumental in persuading 
    Plaintiff Matrix to proceed with the renovations to its detriment.&quot; That 
    finding contradicts the trial judge’s finding, in his reasons for judgment, 
    that Matrix did not rely on the Bank’s representation. In his reasons for 
    judgment, the trial judge looked to Matrix’s after the fact conduct to find 
    an absence of reliance at the time the contract was entered into. We are of 
    the opinion that Matrix's post-renovation conduct was consistent with its 
    reasonable efforts first to collect from Latif and, when unable to do so, 
    to pursue the Bank. Thus, while the trial judge was entitled to have regard 
    to Matrix’s after the fact conduct, that conduct does not support the inference 
    he drew from it and, in any event, is not determinative in view of the trial 
    judge’s further finding that the Bank induced Matrix to enter into the contract 
    to proceed with the renovations.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Given our conclusion that the evidence established the Bank’s misrepresentation 
    and Matrix’s reliance, it is unnecessary to deal with the other grounds of 
    appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the judgment below is set aside. 
    Judgment is entered in favour of Matrix in the undisputed amount of $148,180 
    plus pre-judgment interest at the contract rate. In addition, as found by 
    the trial judge, Matrix is entitled to legal costs of $2,470.51 for the lien. 
    The appellant is also entitled to its trial costs on a partial indemnity basis 
    following assessment. The appellant is entitled to its costs of this appeal 
    fixed in the amount of $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST. </p>
