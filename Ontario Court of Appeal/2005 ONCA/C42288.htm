    </span></span> Moreover, I note that at the hearing before Dorval&nbsp;J., 
    counsel for the only subject of the search warrants who made submissions, 
    Michael Edelson representing A.A., pitched his submissions almost entirely 
    in terms of “the stigmatization to name and reputation that would follow from 
    publication” and “a certain stigma or stain attached to the name of the individual”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>This is precisely the risk that can be overcome by a non&#8209;publication 
    order.</p>

    </span></span> In summary, the <i>Mentuck</i> test requires a balancing between 
    the salutary and deleterious effects of any order that would impinge on freedom 
    of the press.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The test also commands 
    a focus on “reasonably alternative measures”.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The word “balancing” conjures the image of 
    neutrality or even&#8209;handedness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In 
    my view, this image is misplaced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because 
    of the centrality of a free press and open courts in Canadian society and 
    in the Canadian constitution, there is almost a presumption against any form 
    of secrecy in all aspects of court proceedings in Canada.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As stated by Dickson&nbsp;J. in <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>MacIntyre</i> at p.&nbsp;185, “covertness is 
    the exception, and openness the rule.” <i><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></i></p>

    </span></span> The presumption against secrecy applies, specifically, to sealing 
    orders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As expressed by Iacobucci 
    and Arbour JJ. in <i>Vancouver Sun</i> at para.&nbsp;50, “the present facts 
    clearly illustrate the mischief that flows from a presumption of secrecy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Secrecy then becomes the norm, is applied across the board, and sealing 
    orders follow as a matter of course”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 
    courts need to be vigilant to guard against this progression.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>In this case, an order combining press access to the names of the subjects 
    of the search warrants with a prohibition on publishing those names strikes 
    a proper balance.</p>
