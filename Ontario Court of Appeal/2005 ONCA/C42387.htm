  <p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Ellen M. Macdonald 
    of the Superior Court of Justice dated August 13, 2004, reported at [2004] 
    O.J. No. 5019.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>LASKIN J.A.:</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> This appeal turns on the interpretation of s.&nbsp;263 of the <i>Insurance 
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.I.8, which deals with compensation for damage to an 
    automobile caused by a motor vehicle accident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Under this section, an automobile owners own motor vehicle liability 
    insurer must pay for the damage to the extent that its insured was not at 
    fault for the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In this case, the damaged vehicle was insured under two policies: 
    a collision insurance policy issued by The Associates Insurance Company, and 
    a liability insurance policy issued by The Travelers Indemnity Company.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Associates paid for the damage to the vehicle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>It then launched a subrogated claim against Travelers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The sole issue on this appeal is whether s. 263(5) of the <i>Insurance 
    Act </i>bars Associates subrogated claim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Section 263(5) provides that if the section applies, an insurerhas 
    no right of indemnification from or subrogation against any person for payments 
    made to its insured under this section.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>On a motion for summary judgment, the motions judge held that s. 263(5) 
    applied, thus barring Associates claim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>I disagree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Section&nbsp;263(5) 
    only applies if the insurer paid for the damage to its insureds automobile 
    under a motor vehicle liability policy. Because the Associates policy is not 
    a motor vehicle liability policy, s.&nbsp;263 does not apply to it and Associates 
    is therefore not precluded from exercising its right of subrogation.</p>

    </span> On June 14, 2000, Robert Tuttle was driving his tractor-trailer on 
    the Queen Elizabeth Way near Fort Erie when he was rear-ended by a truck driven

    died as a result of the accident.<span

    </span> At the time of the accident, Mr. Tuttle lived in New York State.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Both of the insurance policies on his tractor-trailer were issued in 
    the United States.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Associates policy insured for collision 
    damage only; it was not a motor vehicle liability policy.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(The Associates policy could not have been 
    issued in Ontario, because third party liability coverage is mandatory under 
    the Ontario automobile insurance regime.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>However, the Travelers policy was a motor vehicle liability policy; 
    and moreover, in 1999 Travelers had filed an undertaking with Ontarios Superintendent 
    of Insurance to be bound by s.&nbsp;263.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mr. Batemans truck was insured under a motor 
    vehicle liability policy issued by Markel Insurance, which was licensed to

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mr. Tuttle also made a personal claim against 
    Travelers to recover his deductible. Both Associates and Mr. Tuttle moved

    </span> The motions judge dismissed the motion for summary judgment on a number 
    of grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She held that because 
    Travelers had signed an undertaking to be bound by s.&nbsp;263(5), Associates 
    was barred from bringing a subrogated claim against Travelers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In addition, she held that Travelers Statement 
    of Defence raised triable issues relating to the quantum of damages, liability, 
    and the applicability of the one-year limitation period in s.&nbsp;9(4) of 
    the statutory conditions in the <i>Insurance Act</i>.<span

    </span> At the beginning of oral argument, the panel expressed its concern 
    that the motions judges order was interlocutory and that therefore this court 
    had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Counsel for both parties, however, 
    persuaded us that although the motions judges order was interlocutory, her 
    holding on the application of s.&nbsp;263(5) was a final determination, appealable 
    as of right to this court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was 
    on this determination alone that we heard oral argument.</p>

    </span> Before the enactment of what is now s. 263 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, 
    automobile damage claims were largely governed by the tort system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>When an insureds vehicle was damaged as a result of a car accident, 
    the insured would claim against the tortfeasors insurer, or, if the insured 
    had purchased optional collision coverage, against his or her own insurer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The insureds insurer would then bring a subrogated claim against the 
    tortfeasors insurer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This regime 
    often required not one, but two insurers to settle a single claim; it caused 
    unnecessary delays; and it produced unnecessary increases in transaction costs, 
    resulting in higher premiums.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> By contrast, under the current regime, even if a car owner does not 
    purchase collision coverage, the insureds insurer  not the tortfeasors 
    insurer  pays for the damage to the insureds car to the extent that the 
    insured was not at fault for the accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The insurer pays for the damage under the third party liability 
    section of the insureds own motor vehicle liability policy.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And the insurer has no right of subrogation 
    for the payments made to its own insured.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Moreover, an insured can no longer sue the tortfeasor for damage to 
    his or her car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The insured can recover 
    the at-fault portion of the damages only by buying collision coverage.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This system works on the law of averages:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>the losses even out for automobile insurers, and at the same time, 
    transaction costs are substantially reduced.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Under the previous 
    system insurers subrogated against each other when they paid their insured 
    for automobile damage in circumstances where their insured was not wholly 
    responsible for the accident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even 
    though most insurers were signatories to a settlement agreement which cut 
    down on the number of disputes as to liability, that system still cost money.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>On average a given insurer would pay out approximately $10 million 
    a year to all other insurers for such subrogated claims and would collect 
    the same amount from all other insurers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>All that was happening was that moneys were changing hands and incurring 
    substantial transaction costs along the way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>In effect, there were transaction costs in the system which produced 
    no savings to insurers or insureds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thus, 
    under the new system subrogation has been abolished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Thus, we have a knock for knock system whereby each insurer absorbs 
    most of its policyholders property damage claims without attempting to recover 
    same from the insurers of tortfeasors causing such claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In any individual case, the result can be unfair to the insurer 
    but in the totality of such claims, the result is fair to all insurers.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Insureds are not affected because they are 
    not surcharged in premium for accidents that are not their fault.</p>

    </span> The motions judge held that, because Travelers had signed an undertaking

    subrogated claim against Travelers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However,

    is whether Associates payment to Mr. Tuttle was a payment under s.&nbsp;263.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    (ii)&nbsp;the damaged automobile is insured under a motor vehicle liability 
    policy; and (iii)&nbsp;at least one other automobile involved in the accident 
    is insured under a motor vehicle liability policy.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Where those three conditions are met, insureds

    </span> Because Associates did not insure Mr. Tuttle under a motor vehicle 
    liability policy, its payment to him was not made under s.&nbsp;263(2).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Therefore, Associates is not bound by the prohibition against subrogation 
    in s.&nbsp;263(5)(b).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It may bring a subrogated claim against Travelers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

  <p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Mr. Tuttle is also entitled to

    </span> Travelers, on the other hand, is bound by s.&nbsp;263.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It issued a motor vehicle liability policy 
    to insure Mr. Tuttles tractor-trailer, and it filed an undertaking with the 
    Superintendent to be so bound.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 
    other vehicle involved in the accident  Mr.&nbsp;Batemans truck  was also 
    insured under a motor vehicle liability policy.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    </span> I make two other comments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First, 
    Travelers submitted that because Associates, the collision insurer, extracted 
    a premium from Mr. Tuttle, it should pay for the damage to the tractor-trailer. 
    At first blush, this seems to produce a fair result, but this seemingly fair 
    result has been overtaken by the statutory regime in s.&nbsp;263.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Under that regime, the third party liability coverage in a motor vehicle 
    liability policy must respond to a claim for damage to an automobile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Therefore, subject to the other issues the motions judge ordered to 
    be tried, requiring Travelers to pay for the damage to Mr. Tuttles tractor-trailer 
    is consistent with the purpose of s.&nbsp;263.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Second, this is a highly unusual case involving the applicability 
    of an Ontario statute to an insurance policy that could not have been issued 
    in Ontario.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because such a policy 
    could not be sold in Ontario, it is unlikely that similar cases will arise 
    in the future.</p>

    </span> I would set aside the motions judges holding that Associates is precluded 
    from asserting a subrogated claim against Travelers and hold that it is entitled 
    to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, my holding does 
    not entitle Associates to summary judgment.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The motions judge found that there were other 
    triable issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Accordingly, I would 
    not disturb either her dismissal of the motion for summary judgment or her 
    costs order.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The appellants are entitled
