    dated October 14, 2004, the motions judge granted Nesbitt Burns motion. He 
    struck out those parts of the amended defences and counterclaim that made 
    general allegations about Nesbitt Burns recruiting practices. However, he 
    granted the defendants leave to amend to plead specific instances of recruitment 
    or specific recruitment materials of which they had personal knowledge. The 
    motions judge also held that the defendants could not plead Nesbitt Burns 
    recruiting policies, practices and directives as a defence to the plaintiffs 
    claim for equitable relief or its claim for punitive damages. In the motions

    He concluded that Nesbitt Burns recruiting practices relating to persons 
    other than the defendants were relevant to whether the employment contracts 
    contained implied terms <i>but only</i> to the limited extent that [the transferring

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Nesbitt Burns has sued for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of 
    confidence, and has claimed equitable relief. In response, the defendants 
    have sought to invoke the clean hands doctrine. They have pleaded that Nesbitt 
    Burns is not entitled to equitable relief because it has used the very same 
    recruiting practices and policies it now alleges are improper. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The motions judge struck out the defendants pleading of the clean 
    hands doctrine on the ground that it relates to general allegations of alleged 
    conduct by Nesbitt on unspecified occasions in the recruitment of investment 
    advisors <i>other than</i> the defendants (emphasis in original). In his 
    view, to sustain the pleading the allegation must relate to the specific 
    resignations of the Nesbitt defendant employees. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The defendants concede that they cannot point to any improper conduct 
    by Nesbitt Burns that relates either to their contracts of employment or to 
    their resignations. The defendants also concede that the general morals or 
    unrelated bad conduct of a plaintiff are irrelevant when the defendant seeks 
    to rely on the principle that those who seek equity must come to court with 
    clean hands. The question is how close a connection between the plaintiffs 
    conduct and the contract to be enforced need exist for a defendant to rely 
    on the principle as a defence to a claim for equitable relief?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Here, the defendants submit that similar conduct in the same marketplace 
    is a sufficient connection. In other words, the defendants argue that in deciding 
    whether to grant equitable relief a court is entitled to consider whether 
    Nesbitt Burns secured its own competitive position in the marketplace through 
    practices it now seeks to deny to a competitor. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Nesbitt Burns, on the other hand, submits that to rely on the clean 
    hands principle the defendants must show a direct connection between the plaintiffs 
    conduct and the relief sought. In other words, the plaintiffs misconduct 
    must relate to the very contract it now seeks to enforce. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> It is tempting to accede to the defendants position for two reasons. 
    First, as the plaintiff has already accepted, many of the facts on which the 
    defendants will likely rely are relevant to the first issue, the issue of 
    implied terms; and second, the plain and obvious test for striking out a 
    defence is a high threshold to meet. However, in relying on Nesbitt Burns 
    past recruiting practices and policies to support a clean hands defence, the 
    defendants seek to cast a wider net than they did on the first issue. They 
    seek to rely not just on practices and policies of which they had knowledge 
    while employed at Nesbitt Burns, but also on practices and policies that might 
    come to their knowledge from others. More important, in my view, resort to 
    similar conduct in the marketplace to support the defence of clean hands is 
    not tenable in law. Our court has repeatedly said that a more direct connection 
    is required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> For example, in <i>City of Toronto v. Polai</i> (1970), 1 O.R. 483 
    at 493-4 (C.A.), Schroeder J.A. stressed that the clean hands principle is 
    applicable only where the plaintiffs impugned conduct is directly related 
    to the transaction it has sued on. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The maxim he who comes to equity must come with 
    clean hands which has been invoked mostly in cases between private litigants, 
    required a plaintiff seeking equitable relief to show that his past record 
    <i>in the transaction</i> is clean [emphasis in original]. . . </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The misconduct charged against the plaintiff as 
    a ground for invoking the maxim against him must relate directly to the very 
    transaction concerning which the complaint is made, and not merely to the 
    general morals or conduct of the person seeking relief; or as is indicated 
    by the reporters note in the old case of <i>Jones v. Lenthal</i> (1669) 1 
    Chan. Cas. 154, 22 E.R. 739: . . . that the iniquity [sic] must be done to 
    the defendant himself. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In <i>Raso v. Dionigi</i> (1993), 100 D.L.R. (4th) 459 at 469, this 
    court quoted from and applied the statements of Schroeder J.A. More recently, 
    in <i>SBS Sealants Inc. v. Robroy</i> <i>Industries Ltd.</i> (2002), 59 O.R. 
    (3d) 257 at 265, Carthy J.A. affirmed the need for a direct connection between 
    the plaintiffs conduct and the equitable relief sought. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Sharpe J.A. discusses the doctrine of clean hands 
    in his text <i>Injunctions and Specific Performance</i>, loose leaf (Toronto: 
    Emond Montgomery Publications Ltd., 2001) at para. 1.1030. The author makes 
    it clear through the authorities cited that <u>the misconduct complained of 
    must have secured a person an advantage in the very contract sought to be 
    enforced</u>. It is not a doctrine admitting of a general moral assessment 
    of the plaintiff [emphasis added]. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> It seems to me that the requirement of a direct connection between 
    the plaintiffs conduct and the contract to be enforced is sensible. Even 
    at the pleading stage, permitting the defendants to argue a broader connection 
    based on the plaintiffs general recruiting practices is not justified. And, 
    as I have said, the defendants do not allege any direct connection. In seeking 
    to rely on the clean hands doctrine, they do not allege that Nesbitt Burns 
    breached its contractual obligation to any of the defendants or that it otherwise 
    behaved inequitably towards any defendant. Because the defendants pleadings 
    do not come within the scope of the clean hands doctrine set out by this Court, 
    I see no error in the motions judges ruling on this issue. Therefore, I would 
    not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

mso-ansi-language:EN-CA'>Third issue: Are the defendants entitled to plead and 
    prove properly particularized recruiting practices, policies and directives

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Nesbitt Burns seeks punitive damages from each of the defendants. 
    The defendants wish to defend the claim for punitive damages by arguing that 
    Nesbitt Burns built its own business by the very same conduct it now describes 
    as arrogant, high-handed and reprehensible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The motions judge held that the defendants general allegations about 
    Nesbitt Burns recruiting practices had no relevance to the claim for punitive 
    damages. In my view, the motions judge ought to have permitted the defendants 
    to plead the plaintiffs recruiting practices, policies and directives as 
    a defence to the punitive damages claim. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The typical case where the plaintiffs conduct is relevant to its 
    punitive damages claim is where the conduct led to or caused the misconduct 
    of the defendant  in other words, where there is a causal connection between 
    the plaintiffs conduct and the defendants conduct. For example, in the case 
    of assault, any provocation by the plaintiff will usually diminish the impropriety 
    of the defendants reaction. See for example <i>T.L.C. v. Vancouver (City)</i> 
    [1996] 2 W.W.R. 529 at paras. 95-96 (B.C.S.C.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> This, however, is not the typical case. The defendants do not allege 
    that Nesbitt Burns conduct in recruiting others caused the wrong doing on 
    which the plaintiff relies. Nonetheless, I think the defendants should be 
    able to argue that the conduct of which Nesbitt Burns now complains does not 
    attract the kind of outrage associated with punitive damages because it is 
    widely accepted in the industry and indeed has been employed by the plaintiff 
    in its own recruitment of investment advisors. In <i>Hill v. Church of Scientology</i> 
    [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130 at 1208, Cory J. pointed out that an award of punitive 
    damages is the means by which the jury or judge expresses its outrage at 
    the egregious conduct of the defendant. Here the defendants contend that 
    any outrage at their conduct will be diminished because the plaintiff itself 
    has engaged in the very same conduct. It is not plain and obvious that this 
    argument cannot succeed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> I appreciate that allowing the defendants appeal on this issue may 
    expand the discovery to which Nesbitt Burns is subjected. As they did in respect 
    of the clean hands defence, the defendants seek to plead and prove not just 
    the recruiting practices and policies of Nesbitt Burns that they knew of while 
    employed there, but recruiting practices and policies they have become aware 
    of from others. On my holding, they are entitled to do so in defending the 
    punitive damages claim. Having asserted this claim, the plaintiff cannot escape 
    relevant questioning about its recruiting practices. The requirement for particulars 
    will put manageable limits on the production and discovery process. I would 
    allow the defendants appeal on this issue. </p>

    costs of the appeal. I would not disturb the costs order of the motions judge.</p>
