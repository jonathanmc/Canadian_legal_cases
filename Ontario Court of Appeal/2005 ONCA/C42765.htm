    search and seizure under s. 8 and excluded the counterfeit bills pursuant

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. <span

    </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. <span

    a customs officer in authority. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. <span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>There is the most highly intrusive category 
    of search - sometimes referred to as the body cavity search - in which customs 
    officers have recourse to medical doctors, X&#8209;rays, emetics, and to other 
    highly invasive means.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Dickson C.J.C. emphasised that each of the different categories of

    more the requisite justification and the constitutional protection.<span

    (2004), 185 C.C.C. (3d) 308 (S.C.C.) to distinguish the degree of difference 
    in intrusiveness of searches such as frisk and pocket are of little assistance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

    </span></span> I conclude, therefore, that the trial judge erred by failing 
    to recognize that a pocket search is a non-invasive routine screening procedure 
    within the legitimate purpose of border crossings, which does not raise <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Charter</i> 
    issues.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In doing so, she wrongly decided that s. 98 
    of the <i>Customs Act </i>applied.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, 
    given my conclusion that there was no breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>, 
    it follows that the trial judge erred in excluding the evidence pursuant to 
    section 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>. </p>

    the order excluding evidence and the judgment of acquittal, and order a new 
    trial. </p>
