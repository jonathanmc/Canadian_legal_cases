    </span> That said, our task at this point in time differs from that of the 
    sentencing judge. We are not required to impose the sentence he should have 
    imposed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rather, we are required to 
    fashion a fit and just sentence taking into account all of the relevant facts 
    and circumstances, including the fresh evidence filed by the respondent with 
    the consent of the Crown and the Crowns submission that at this juncture, 
    we should set aside the conditional sentence (of which the respondent has 
    successfully completed five and one-half months) and send him to jail for 
    a period of six or seven months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Much as we appreciate the Crowns position and regard it as reasonable, 
    we do not believe that the interests of justice would be served by sending 
    the respondent to jail at this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On 
    the contrary, taking into account his faithful compliance with the terms of 
    his conditional sentence order and the strides he has made and continues to 
    make in his program of treatment, we believe that the interests of the respondent 
    and society are best served by allowing the respondent to go forward with 
    his rehabilitative efforts while at the same time, requiring that he comply 
    strictly with the punitive terms of his conditional sentence order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Returning to the issue of deference, there are two reasons for concluding 
    that we need not show deference to the sentence imposed by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> First, we take a dim view of the manner in which the trial judge conducted 
    the sentence hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His conduct 
    was precipitous and injudicious and it should not be repeated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> That said, allowing for some informality in the proceeding and bearing 
    in mind that in the end, through the admirable persistence of Crown counsel, 
    the trial judge did listen to and consider the Crowns position on sentencing, 
    we would stop short of adopting the submission of Crown counsel on appeal 
    that the trial judges conduct gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Nonetheless, we take it into account in our overall determination that 
    we owe no deference to the sentence imposed by him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The second reason for holding that deference need not be shown stems 
    from the trial judges reasons for sentence.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>In short, the trial judge gave virtually no reasons and he engaged 
    in almost no analysis in arriving at the impugned sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In the circumstances, when that deficiency is considered along with 
    the trial judges injudicious conduct, we have serious concerns that he may 
    not have applied the correct principles of sentencing in arriving at the impugned 
    sentence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Indeed, given its inadequacy, 
    it is reasonable to infer that he focussed almost entirely on the respondents 
    prospects for rehabilitation and virtually ignored the principles of denunciation 
    and deterrence and the need to protect society from persons who pose a serious 
    risk to its safety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> With deference not an issue, we agree with Juriansz J.A. (largely 
    for the reasons outlined by him) that the trial judge erred in imposing a 
    conditional sentence at the time of sentencing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the circumstances existing then, a conditional 
    sentence did not offer sufficient protection to the public and it failed to 
    adequately reflect the principles of denunciation and general and specific 
    deterrence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As we stated earlier, 
    at the time of sentencing, this case called for a mid to upper reformatory 
    term to be followed by a lengthy period of probation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> That said, although we accept that the case is a close one, we do 
    not share our colleagues view that the respondent should be sent to jail 
    at this time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Over the past five and 
    one-half months, he has faithfully complied with both the punitive and rehabilitative 
    terms of his conditional sentence order.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Significantly, the fresh evidence confirms 
    that he is progressing well in his program of treatment and with every passing 
    day, his positive behaviour lends credence to Dr. Shepphards prognosis, offered 
    somewhat tentatively at the sentence hearing, that the likelihood of a recurrence 
    of behaviour similar to that at the time of the offence is, in my opinion, 
    low.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Turning to the principle of denunciation, we note that the respondents 
    criminal conduct attracted a good deal of notoriety in the Thunder Bay community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>In the circumstances, this may be one of those situations, referred 
    to by Lamer C.J.C. in <i>R. v. Proulx</i> (2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), 
    where a conditional sentence does have a denunciatory impact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>At para. 105, the Chief Justice observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The stigma of 
    a conditional sentence with house arrest should not be underestimated. Living 
    in the community under strict conditions where fellow residents are well aware 
    of the offenders criminal misconduct can provide ample denunciation in many 
    cases. In certain circumstances, the shame of encountering members of the 
    community may make it even more difficult for the offender to serve his or 
    her sentence in the community than in prison.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> With respect to the principle of general deterrence, these reasons 
    are meant to send a clear message to the community at large. People who wilfully 
    disobey firearms prohibition orders and who knowingly engage in dangerous 
    and disruptive behaviour can expect to receive severe sentences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> As for the principle of specific deterrence, apart from the punitive 
    aspects of the respondents conditional sentence order, he should know with 
    certainty that if he breaches the terms of his order, he will likely serve 
    the duration of the order in jail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As 
    well, if he chooses to engage in further criminality, he should not expect 
    lenient treatment from the courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In sum, having regard to the relevant principles of sentencing, we 
    think that it would be counterproductive at this time to send the respondent 
    to jail for the six or seven months sought by the Crown.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To do so would run the risk of frustrating 
    the positive steps that the respondent has taken towards his ultimate rehabilitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Such an approach would not serve the interests of the respondent or 
    the community at large. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> In our view, at this juncture, society is best protected by permitting 
    the respondent to go forward with his rehabilitative efforts, while at the 
    same time requiring that he adhere strictly to the punitive aspects of his 
    conditional sentence order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Accordingly, while we would grant leave to appeal, we would dismiss 
    the Crowns appeal from sentence.</p>
