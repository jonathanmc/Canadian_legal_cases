lang=PT>      </span><span lang=EN-GB>The applicant seeks bail pending appeal.
    He was sentenced to two years in prison plus three years probation following a
    guilty plea to one count each of creation and distribution of child pornography.
    When the applicant, who is now twenty-six, was twenty-two years old, he had a
    relationship with a fifteen-year-old girl. When she ended the relationship, he
    was upset and used some pictures he had taken of them having sex together with
    her name to make a collage, which he posted on the Internet.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      After serving several months of his sentence, the applicant
    was released on parole on the three conditions that are also the conditions of
    his probation: (1) no contact with the complainant; (2) attend for psychiatric
    or psychological counselling; and (3) he could not own, possess or operate a
    computer or device that had access to the Internet.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      The applicant is appealing both his conviction and his
    sentence, the former based on ineffective representation by counsel. The appeal
    is expected to be heard before the summer.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      The applicant wants the condition of his parole that restricts
    his access to computers to be suspended at this point because he wants to
    pursue a career in computers that he began before these charges.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      The Crown opposes the application on both jurisdictional and
    substantive grounds. The jurisdictional issue is raised by the wording of s.
    679 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which allows a judge of the Court of Appeal to
    release an appellant from “custody” pending the determination of his or her
    appeal. The question is, when a person has been released on parole, is the
    person still in custody within the meaning of s. 679?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      A body of case law has developed around this question across
    the country. In Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia, the issue has arisen in
    the context of a conditional sentence. The Courts of Appeal in all three
    provinces have held that a conditional sentence is a sentence of imprisonment
    under s. 742 of the <i>Code</i> and a form of custody for the purpose of s.
    679: <i>R. v. Vallance</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 1615 (C.A.)<i>; R. v. Cantin</i>,<i> </i>[1999] Q.J. No. 2610 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Hornby</i>, [2003] B.C.J. No. 2793
    (C.A.). Similarly, in Nova Scotia, the Court of Appeal considered the issue
    where the appellant had been released on day parole, so that he was returning
    to prison in the evenings. Again the court held that the person was in custody
    for the purpose of s. 679: <i>R. v. Wood</i> (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 468 and
    475 (N.S.C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      The difference in this case is that the applicant is on full
    parole and will not return to jail unless he is guilty of a breach of
    conditions of release. Section 128(1) of the <i>Corrections and Conditional
    Release Act</i>, S.C. 1992, c. 20, provides that while at large on parole the
    offender continues to serve his sentence. Subsection (2) distinguishes day
    parole and provides that a person on parole is “not liable to be returned to
    custody” unless the parole is revoked.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      Despite the use of the word “custody” in s. 128(2) of the <i>Corrections
    and Conditional Release Act</i> to mean actual incarceration, the term has been
    given a broader meaning as it is used in s. 679 of the <i>Code</i>. In <i>Vallance</i>,
    Abella J.A. said: “In my view, a conditional sentence is a form of custody
    sufficient to trigger the release provisions of the <i>Code</i>.” In <i>Wood,</i> Cromwell J.A. reasoned at pp. 472-3:</span></p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>In my view, this application
    cannot be resolved simply by parsing the meaning of the word “custody” divorced
    from the particular context in which the word is used. Custody is a word capable
    of having a wide variety of meanings, depending on the context. A parent has
    custody of a child. A prisoner may be in custody while attending a medical
    appointment at a hospital, or while sitting in a court room. The word takes its
    meaning form the particular context in which it is used and so it is necessary
    to examine the context here.</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>What is at issue on this
    application is the jurisdiction of the Court to address the risk that an appeal
    may have no practical effect because of the time required to hear and determine
    it. For example, if all, or most, of a sentence has been served by the time an
    appeal is heard, the sentence cannot be undone if the appeal is successful. On
    the other hand, the general rule must be that court orders, including sentences
    imposed for crimes, are enforceable when made unless and until the orders are
    varied on appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      Cromwell J.A. also pointed out that an offender is deemed to
    be serving his or her sentence while on day parole. Under s. 128(1) of the <i>Corrections
    and Conditional Release Act</i>, the same is true about full parole. However, I
    do note that Glube C.J.N.S., in upholding the decision, referred to the fact
    that a day parolee must return to the institution at night [(1999), 139 C.C.C.
    (3d) 475 (N.S.C.A.)]. Although this observation distinguishes full parole, in
    my view the distinction is not determinative. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Read together, the relevant <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions plus the case law to date allow courts of appeal to grant release
    from all forms of sentence pending appeal, except for parole. The <i>Code</i> expressly gives a judge of a court of appeal the authority to release, pending
    appeal, an appellant who is incarcerated (s. 679), and to suspend, pending
    appeal, the obligation to pay a fine, an order of forfeiture or disposition of
    forfeited property, a restitution order, an order to pay a victim surcharge,
    and conditions prescribed in a probation order (s. 683(5)). The decisions
    already referred to have interpreted s. 679 to allow a court of appeal to
    release an appellant from a conditional sentence and from day parole pending
    appeal. In my view, a person on parole who continues to serve his sentence is
    in no different position, and is under a form of custody sufficient to engage
    the jurisdiction of the court under s. 679. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB> The Crown also points out that the applicant is
    not without remedy, as he could seek a parole variation. I agree that he also
    has that avenue to pursue. However, that does not derogate from the
    jurisdiction of this court to allow release pending appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>On the substantive issue, the Crown is concerned
    about the applicant’s ability to access computers and the Internet, given the
    nature of the offence. I note that this is not the more typical situation where
    an offender is using the Internet as a business or a hobby to view or
    distribute child pornography. This was a one time, immature and very
    unfortunate response to a personal life event. The applicant is now in a stable
    relationship and would like to be able to work with computers and possibly to
    study as well. The applicant has filed a letter from his parole officer
    recommending if bail is granted, that the computer restriction on the applicant
    be removed or modified to allow him to access computers for employment
    purposes. The parole officer also recommends that access to the Internet be
    limited because of the nature of the offence. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The final issue is counselling which the
    applicant is now undergoing, and which is paid for as part of the parole
    regime. The Crown submits that it would be counter-productive to interrupt the counselling
    at this point, but the cost of $125.00 per week is not affordable for the
    applicant on his own.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In the circumstances of this case, bail will be
    granted pending appeal on the following conditions: (a) the condition that the
    applicant have no contact with the complainant remains in effect; (b) the
    applicant may use computers and the Internet for employment purposes, not
    including self-employment, on the understanding that in employment, his
    Internet use will be monitored and/or supervised; and (c) the applicant is to
    continue the present counselling if the authorities can arrange for payment.
