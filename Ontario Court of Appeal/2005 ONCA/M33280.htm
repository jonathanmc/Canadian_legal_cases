style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a review under s. 680 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46
    (the “<i>Code</i>”) of the order of Lally J. of the Superior Court of Justice
    (the “bail judge”) dated July 19, 2005 detaining the appellant in custody
    pending trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was arrested on March 17, 2005 on a charge of first degree murder.  After
    approximately four months in custody, he sought bail pending trial.  The
    bail judge ordered the continued detention of the appellant based solely
    on s.&nbsp;515(10)(c) of the <i>Code</i>, the Crown having conceded at the
    bail hearing that ss. 515(10)(a) and (b) of the <i>Code</i> are not engaged
    in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 19, 2005, the Chief Justice of Ontario ordered a review of the detention
    order pursuant to s. 680(1) of the <i>Code</i>.  In accordance with s. 680(2)
    of the <i>Code</i>, the parties agreed that a single judge could hear the
    review.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that the appellant has demonstrated that
    his continued detention pending trial is not necessary within the meaning
    of s. 515(10)(c) of the <i>Code</i>.  Consequently, the detention order cannot
    stand. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        Background Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 17, 2005, the appellant was arrested and charged with the first degree
    murder of Adam Bender.  The appellant is 23 years of age.  At the time of
    his arrest, he resided in Bowmanville with his wife and infant son.  He was
    employed by his brother-in-law at a welding and fabricating business in that
    town.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Approximately
    two months after the appellant’s arrest and following an extensive police
    search, Kyle James Odette was also arrested and charged with first degree
    murder in relation to Bender’s death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the proceedings before the bail judge, the Crown suggested that Bender had
    been selling crack cocaine and that the appellant, Odette and Bender were
    associated and involved together in the drug trade.  The Crown also asserted
    that, on the day in question, the appellant and Odette drove together to
    Bender’s home in the appellant’s car to collect a drug debt from Bender,
    that Bender was subsequently seriously beaten and ultimately shot at, and
    that he later died either as a result of this beating or from hypothermia
    caused by exposure to freezing temperatures, in association with the beating.  No
    bullet was found in Bender’s body following his death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 9, 2005, a post-mortem examination report concerning the victim, which
    was not available at the time of the bail hearing, was provided to counsel
    for the appellant.  It confirmed that the cause of Bender’s death was hypothermia
    due to exposure to cold environment.  “Acute ethanol intoxication (ethanol-induced
    cold susceptibility)” was described in the report as a significant contributing
    factor to the cause of death.  On consent, this report was introduced as
    fresh evidence on this review hearing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, two forensic reports from the Ministry of Community Safety and
    Correctional Services became available after the bail hearing.  These reports,
    filed on this review hearing without objection from the appellant’s counsel,
    detail the results of forensic testing, including DNA analysis, on various
    items.  They disclose that a small amount of Bender’s blood was detected
    on one of the appellant’s shoes and in the trunk of his car following the
    appellant’s arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective
    Pat Finnegan, an investigating police officer, testified at the bail hearing
    on behalf of the Crown.  He said that, at the time of his death, Bender was
    living with his girlfriend, Jenoa Meagher, in Belleville.  According to Finnegan,
    Meagher told the police that Bender had been selling drugs, including crack
    cocaine, in the Belleville area, that a man named Odette from Oshawa was
    his crack cocaine supplier, and that Bender was indebted to Odette in the
    amount of $1,500.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Meagher
    provided a statement to the police.  She said that on March 12, 2005, Odette
    and the appellant, who was a stranger to Meagher, went to Meagher’s apartment.  Sometime
    thereafter, the two men left the apartment with Bender to go to a local strip
    club.  Later that night, Odette and the appellant returned to the apartment.  Bender
    arrived subsequently.  He was drunk and appeared to have been beaten up.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Bender discovered Odette in his girlfriend’s bedroom, he threw a cup of coffee
    in Odette’s face.  This caused Odette to rush Bender out of the apartment
    and  to begin beating him.  When the beating stopped, Meagher attempted to
    clean Bender up with a towel.  He appears to have been bleeding profusely.  Meagher
    asked the men to leave.  Odette and the appellant did so, indicating that
    they would take Bender with them and drop him off at his mother’s house in
    Oshawa.  According to Meagher, Bender expressed no reluctance to accompany
    Odette and the appellant.  The trio left in the appellant’s car.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Meagher
    also told the police that she did not see the appellant participating at
    any time in the beating of Bender at the apartment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bender’s
    body was later discovered by the police in a field following a report from
    nearby residents that they had found bloodied clothes in a ditch and that
    they had heard two gunshots in the vicinity during the early hours of March
    13, 2005.  The body was naked notwithstanding below zero temperatures.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finnegan
    testified that only one set of footprints was visible leading through the
    field to the spot where Bender’s body was found.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the recovery of Bender’s body, the police interviewed various witnesses at
    the strip club.  They confirmed that an altercation occurred at the club
    and that one male was slapped.  None of these witnesses said that they saw
    the appellant hitting Bender at the club.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Odette
    was interviewed by the police at the time of his arrest.  A copy of his statement
    was filed at the bail hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Odette
    made several important admissions in his statement.  He told police that
    after he left Meagher’s apartment with the appellant and Bender, they pulled
    the car over to the side of the road.  Odette said that he opened the door
    to the back seat of the car where Bender was sitting and started hitting
    Bender and demanding his money back.  He told Bender to strip because he “just
    wanted him to be cold and…to suffer like…I didn’t want him to suffer this
    bad….”.  He also stated, “I remember shooting the gun this way and he was
    here and I shot it over here…”.  Odette claimed that although he kicked Bender
    when he was on the ground and fired his gun near Bender, Bender ran away
    and he, Odette, did not know how Bender died.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Odette
    also told the police that the appellant never got out of the car and that
    the appellant did not have a gun.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.       Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the bail judge erred in his refusal of bail based on
    s. 515(10)(c) of the <i>Code</i>, the tertiary ground, by ignoring the presumption
    of innocence and by misapplying the principles set out in <i>R. v. Hall</i> (2002),
    167 C.C.C. (3d) 149 (S.C.C.) to the facts of this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    515(10) of the <i>Code</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>s. 515(10)  For the purpose of this section, the
    detention of an accused in custody is justified only on one or more of the
    following grounds:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>where
    the detention is necessary to ensure his or her attendance in court in order
    to be dealt with according to law;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>where
    the detention is necessary for the protection or safety of the public, including
    any victim of or witness to the offence, having regard to all the circumstances
    including any substantial likelihood that the accused will, if released from
    custody, commit a criminal offence or interfere with the administration of
    justice; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>on
    any other just cause being shown and, without limiting the generality of
    the foregoing, where the detention is necessary in order to maintain confidence
    in the administration of justice, having regard to all the circumstances,
    including the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case, the gravity of
    the nature of the offence, the circumstances surrounding its commission and
    the potential for a lengthy term of imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the Crown conceded at the bail hearing that the detention of the
    appellant could not be justified under either the primary or secondary grounds
    for detention set out in ss. 515(10)(a) and (b).  Instead, the Crown sought
    the continued detention of the appellant based solely on the tertiary ground
    set out in s. 515(10)(c).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Hall,
      supra</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada emphasized that bail can be denied
      pursuant to s. 515(10)(c), that is, on the basis of maintaining confidence
      in the adminis-tration of justice, only in limited circumstances.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Hall</i> also
    establishes that, in determining whether detention is necessary under s.
    515(10)(c), consideration must be given to all the circumstances of the case
    including, especially: (i) the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case;
    (ii) the gravity of the nature of the offence; (iii) the circumstances surrounding
    the commission of the offence; and (iv) the potential for lengthy imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court elaborated at para. 40:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 515(10)(c) sets out specific factors which
    delineate a narrow set of circumstances under which bail can be denied on
    the basis of maintaining confidence in the administration of justice.  As
    discussed earlier, situations may arise where, despite the fact the accused
    is not likely to abscond or commit further crimes while awaiting trial, his
    presence in the community will call into question the public’s confidence
    in the administration of justice.  Whether such a situation has arisen is
    judged by all the circumstances, but in particular the four factors that
    Parliament has set out in s. 515(10)(c) – the apparent strength of the prosecution’s
    case, the gravity of the nature of the offence, the circumstances surrounding
    its commission and the potential for lengthy imprisonment.  Where, as here,
    the crime is horrific, inexplicable and strongly linked to the accused, a
    justice system that cannot detain the accused risks losing the public confidence
    upon which the bail system and the justice system as a whole repose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    presumption of innocence is a foundational principle that animates the entirety
    of Canadian criminal law.  In this context, s. 11(e) of the <i>Charter of
    Rights and Freedoms</i> provides that a person charged with an offence has
    the right not to be denied reasonable bail absent demonstration of just cause
    for detention.  This right rests on the presumption of innocence and recognizes
    the right to a fair trial before punishment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this review hearing, the issue is whether the appellant has met his burden
    of demonstrating that his detention pending trial is not necessary in order
    to maintain confidence in the administration of justice within the meaning
    of s. 515(10)(c) and the developed jurisprudence.  The applicable test was
    enunciated in <i>Hall</i> as follows (at para. 41): </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the end of the day, the judge can only deny
    bail if satisfied that in view of these factors [the factors identified in
    s.&nbsp;515(10)(c)] and related circumstances a reasonable member of the
    community would be satisfied that denial is necessary to maintain confidence
    in the administration of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    515(10)(c) of the <i>Code</i> thus seeks to strike an appropriate balance
    between the rights of an accused prior to trial and the need to maintain
    justice in the community: <i>Hall</i>, at para. 41. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the appellant has met his burden to demonstrate that his continued
    detention pending trial is not necessary for the purpose described in s.
    515(10)(c) of the <i>Code</i> and that the bail judge erred in denying bail
    on the basis of s. 515(10)(c).  I say this for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    in my view, the import of the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Hall</i> is
    that s. 515(10)(c) can only be used sparingly to deny bail.  Where, as here,
    the Crown places no reliance on ss. 515(10)(a) and (b) of the <i>Code</i> to
    oppose bail, the detention of an accused under s. 515(10)(c) will be justified
    only in rare cases.  I did not understand the Crown to challenge this proposition
    on this review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the nature of the offence charged, by itself, cannot justify the denial of
    bail.  As observed by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Blind</i> (1999),
    139 C.C.C. (3d) 87 at para. 15, under Canadian criminal law there are no
    categories of offences for which bail is not a possibility.  While murder
    is undeniably a grievous crime, Parliament has not chosen to place pre-trial
    bail beyond the reach of those accused of murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    can a detention order under s. 515(10)(c) rest solely on a strong Crown case
    against an accused.  Were it otherwise, the presumption of innocence would
    be undermined.  The force of the Crown’s case is but one factor, albeit an
    important one, to be considered in the s. 515(10)(c) analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    I am of the opinion that the bail judge overstated the strength of the Crown’s
    case against the appellant.  He stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Applying the Chief Justice’s remarks [in <i>Hall</i>]
    to this case, there is no doubt in my mind that both Mr. Odette and Mr. Laframboise
    are guilty of culpable homicide.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I agree with [defence counsel] that the chances
    of Mr. Laframboise being convicted of first degree murder are slim.  But
    I agree with [Crown counsel] that he is a party with Odette to the killing
    of Adam Bender.  And the Crown has a strong case against Mr. Laframboise
    for culpable homicide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, having regard to the statements made to the police by the victim’s
    girlfriend and the co-accused Odette, I do not believe that it can be said
    that the Crown’s case against the accused is overwhelming for either murder
    or manslaughter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this record, the evidence suggests that there is a significant difference
    between the appellant’s interactions with Bender and those of Odette.  In
    addition, the fresh evidence in the form of the post-mortem examination report
    further weakens the Crown’s case against the appellant.  Although the DNA
    testing results may augment the appellant’s connection to Bender’s death,
    there are a variety of possible explanations for the presence of Bender’s
    blood on the appellant’s shoe.  Bender’s beating at the apartment, for example,
    apparently caused considerable bleeding.  Moreover, the thesis that Bender
    was transported in the trunk of the appellant’s car appears to be inconsistent
    with the balance of the evidence.  It is significant, in this regard, that
    Odette’s statement to the police places Bender in the back seat of the appellant’s
    car prior to the second beating and that Bender appears to have accompanied
    Odette and the appellant willingly.  Odette’s statement is hearsay in respect
    of the appellant, but I find it of assistance in considering the potential
    impact of the appellant’s release.  It demonstrates that Odette and the appellant
    are very differently situated.  Proof that the appellant was present at the
    crime scene is a start, not the finish, to fixing the appellant with criminal
    responsibility for Bender’s death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    and perhaps most importantly, the reasons of the bail judge do not support
    the conclusion that the facts here are sufficient to elevate this case to
    that narrow category of cases where detention may be justified exclusively
    under s. 515(10(c) of the <i>Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    bail judge based his detention order on: (i) his view that the Crown had
    a strong case against the appellant for culpable homicide; (ii) his conclusion
    that there is a real potential in this case for lengthy imprisonment; (iii)
    the apparent circumstances surrounding Bender’s death; and (iv) the fact
    that the offence charged is grave.  No other reason for the continued detention
    of the appellant is articulated in the reasons of the bail judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Blind</i>,
    the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal stressed that a detention order under s.
    515(10)(c) requires a showing of ‘something more’ than the fact that the
    charge is grave, potential punishment may be lengthy and the Crown has a
    strong case in the context of the circumstances surrounding the commission
    of the offence.  The Court of Appeal stated at para. 15:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There are few crimes of violence or of murder where
    one could not say that the gravity of the offence, considered on its own,
    without regard for the purpose of bail, justifies detention.  There are also
    many cases where the strength of the Crown’s case appears, at the pre-trial
    stage, to be overwhelming only to have it unravel as the trial progresses.  It
    is also dangerous to place too much emphasis on the possibility of a lengthy
    prison term as all serious crimes carry the possibility of such.  Giving
    undue weight to this factor becomes a means to start punishment before conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the ‘something more’ is the circumstances surrounding the com-mission
    of the crime.  They are egregious.  As the bail judge observed, it appears
    that Bender was “stripped naked, beaten, shot at and left naked in the woods
    where he froze to death”.  But this factor must be considered with what seems
    to be the appellant’s limited involvement and the question of the strength
    of the Crown’s case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that there is nothing that sets this case apart from those in which
    detention was denied because it could not be justified on the ground that
    it was necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV.       Disposition</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    for the reasons given, I would set aside the detention order and substitute
    in its stead an order granting bail to the appellant on the terms agreed
    by counsel, attached hereto as Schedule “A”, pending trial or further court
    order.</p>
