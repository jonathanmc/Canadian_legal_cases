  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction
      entered on February 20, 1999 and sentence imposed on March 29, 1999 by
      Justice Terrance A. Platana of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with
      a jury.</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>LASKIN J.A.:</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>A. OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant Jamie Perlett was convicted of murdering his parents, James and
    Carole Perlett, on March 22, 1996. The Crown alleged that he went into his
    parents’ bedroom in the middle of the night, and using his father’s target
    pistol, shot them both at close range as they lay sleeping. The Crown adduced
    an overwhelming body of circumstantial evidence pointing to the appellant’s
    guilt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified in his own defence. He claimed that he had fallen asleep
    watching television in the basement of the family home. He awoke to the sound
    of gunshots and went upstairs where he encountered a masked intruder armed
    with a gun. He grabbed for the gun. As he did so, he was shot in the abdomen.  He
    still managed to pry the gun away from the intruder, who then ran from the
    house. The Crown contended that the appellant had fabricated the story about
    the intruder. Instead, he had shot himself to cover up the murders of his
    parents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. However, at
    the end of the Crown’s case, the trial judge directed verdicts of acquittal
    on the first-degree murder charges. The trial continued on the lesser and
    included offence of second-degree murder. The entire trial took three months.  After
    deliberating for six days, the jury found the appellant guilty on both counts.
    The trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment, without eligibility for
    parole for eighteen years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals his convictions and asks for a new trial. The Crown appeals
    the directed verdicts of acquittal, but seeks a new trial on first-degree
    murder only if the appellant succeeds on his appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises six grounds of appeal against his convictions. He submits
    that the trial judge erred: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. In taking away the theory of the defence by
    telling the jury large parts of it were based on speculation.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. In instructing the jury on motive, both by leaving
    certain evidence relied on by the Crown as evidence of motive, and by failing
    to relate the evidence of absence of motive to the theory of the defence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3. In instructing the jury on post-offence conduct
    and in leaving to the jury demeanour evidence as post-offence conduct capable
    of supporting an inference of guilt.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4. In failing to correct Crown counsel’s invitation
    to the jury to shift the burden of proof.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5. In excluding the evidence of Dr. Loftus, an
    expert on memory, or in failing to instruct the jury on the frailties of
    memories formed in traumatic situations.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6. In admitting the opinion evidence of the Crown’s
    expert forensic pathologist, Dr. Pan, because it was unreliable and unscientific.
    In connection with this ground of appeal, the appellant seeks leave to introduce
    fresh evidence challenging the reliability of Dr. Pan’s opinion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    I undoubtedly do a disservice to the thorough and skilful arguments put forward
    by the appellant’s counsel, I propose to canvass the grounds of appeal relatively
    briefly. I propose to do so because, in my view, the evidence of the appellant’s
    guilt is so overwhelming that any verdict other than a conviction could not
    be rationally supported.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the appellant can show that the trial judge committed a serious error – and
    I do not think that he did – I would uphold the convictions by applying the
    proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>. Only the
    fourth ground of appeal pertaining to the burden of proof is not amenable
    to the proviso and I see no merit in that ground. I agree with the Crown
    that the alleged errors of the trial judge do not cast doubt on the fairness
    of the trial, or on the reliability of the verdicts. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B. THE CROWN’S OVERWHELMING
      CASE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    dealing with the appellant’s grounds for appeal, I propose to deal with the
    Crown’s case, which I consider overwhelming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    the appellant murdered his parents seems inexplicable, impossible to fathom.
    One strains to find otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the murders, the appellant seemed to be a normal nineteen year-old,
    living at home with his mother, his father and his sister on a quiet residential
    street in Fort Frances, Ontario. He had no record of criminality; he had
    no evidence of a mental disorder; and by all accounts, he had no animosity
    toward either of his parents. Indeed, to the contrary, the Perletts appeared
    to be a close-knit family.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
    there were frictions. The appellant depended financially on his parents,
    and knew that his mother had recently inherited a sizeable sum of money.
    The appellant wanted to move to Red Deer, Alberta with his fiancée, to go
    to school there. However, his parents were reluctant to assist him unless
    he showed a greater sense of ambition and responsibility. Evidence was led
    that the appellant was possessive of his fiancée, that Mrs. Perlett had tried
    to interfere in their relationship, and that he and his fiancée had had a
    disagreement or at least some tension between them the evening before the
    murders. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of these frictions seems severe enough to have precipitated the appellant’s
    actions. And yet the Crown’s web of circumstantial evidence shows that the
    appellant must have committed these murders. I will review this evidence,
    and as did the Crown both at trial and on appeal, will separate it into five
    categories:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>evidence
    that the murders were an “inside job”;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>evidence
    that the appellant was the only “insider” who had the opportunity to commit
    the murders;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>physical
    evidence that strongly pointed to the appellant’s guilt;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>evidence
    that undermined the appellant’s story about an intruder; and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>evidence
    showing that the appellant repeatedly gave inconsistent accounts of what
    occurred and made false statements in order to mislead the police.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>            1. Evidence that
      the murders were an
    “inside job”</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant’s parents were killed with a high standard semi-automatic target
      gun owned by Mr. Perlett.  The murderer had to know where both the gun
      and ammunition were stored and where the keys to obtain each were located.  Only
      an
    “insider” would have had this knowledge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      murder weapon was stored in a locked gun locker inside of the garage along
      with several other firearms.  Nothing about the appearance of the locker
      would give an outsider to the Perlett household any idea that guns were
      stored inside it.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
      obtain the gun from the locker required two keys: a key to open the locker,
      and a key to release the trigger lock, which further secured the murder
      weapon.  There were many keys to the trigger lock, but only one key to
      the gun locker.  That key was on James Perlett’s key ring.   The appellant
      and his sister knew this.  They also knew that their father kept his key
      ring in one of three places</span>:<span lang=EN-US> his jacket pocket,
      a key rack behind the door or an ashtray.  After the murders, the key ring
      was found in the pocket of James Perlett’s jacket, which was hanging on
      the back of a chair in the dining room.  The keys to the gun locker and
      trigger lock were missing.  Several weeks after the murders, when the snow
      had thawed, a</span> neighbour<span lang=EN-US> found these keys in his
      backyard.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      addition to Mr. Perlett’s key ring, there were many other sets of keys
      in the house.  None of the keys, including those on Mr. Perlett’s key ring,
      was labeled.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
      Perlett stored his ammunition for his guns in a filing cabinet in the garage.  It
      was not apparent from looking at the cabinet that ammunition was stored
      there.  The key to the filing cabinet was also on Mr. Perlett’s key ring.  In
      the filing cabinet were two boxes of the type of ammunition used in the
      murder weapon.  Both boxes were full; each contained fifty bullets. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
      partially used box of this type of ammunition was found in the pantry in
      the basement, in a box of hunting gear.  It contained forty unused bullets.  Ten
      bullets were accounted for as follows: four bullets were used to kill the
      Perletts; one bullet injured the appellant; three bullets were fired by
      the appellant, on his account, at the fleeing intruder; and two bullets
      remained in the gun.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That
      an insider committed the murders was evidenced not just by the knowledge
      required to obtain the gun and ammunition, but also by the entire absence
      of any evidence of a home invasion.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      was no evidence of a forced entry into the house, the garage, the gun locker
      or the filing cabinet.  There was no indication that the gun locker or
      the filing cabinet had been searched.  Although the gun locker contained
      several firearms, the killer went directly to the high standard gun, which
      was the only semi-automatic weapon.  The gun itself was found in the hallway.  The
      appellant’s blood alone was on it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      was no indication of an attempted robbery, ransacking of the house or,
      random selection of the Perlett home to do violence.  At the time of the
      murders, four cars were parked outside the house.  When the police arrived,
      the house was mostly in darkness, yet there was no evidence of any disturbance
      that might have been caused by a person unfamiliar with the house searching
      about in poor lighting.  Nothing had been stolen.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      all this evidence, the conclusion that the murders were an inside job seems
      inescapable.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>2.      Evidence that the appellant was the
      only
    “insider” who had the opportunity to commit the murders</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was home alone with his parents the night of the murders.  He was
    the only insider who could have committed these murders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His
    sister Kelly and her boyfriend slept at his parents’ farm that evening.  The
    appellant’s fiancée was at home with her mother.  The appellant’s uncle had
    a key to the garage and knew how to use guns, but he was at home in bed with
    his wife when the murders took place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bradley
    Holmes, Carole Perlett’s brother, was targeted as a suspect by the defence.  He
    was a substance abuser and had a criminal record, but not for offences of
    violence.  He had never threatened any member of the Perlett family.  He
    did not match the appellant’s description of the “intruder”.  He had been
    hospitalized recently for alcoholism.  Most important, on the night of the
    murders he was staying at a motel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    the conclusion that the appellant was the only insider with the opportunity
    to commit these murders seems inescapable.</p>
  <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>3. Physical evidence strongly pointing to the
      appellant’s guilt</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    items of physical evidence implicated the appellant in the murders: shoe
    print evidence, and the partially used box of ammunition in the basement
    pantry </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i) Shoe print evidence  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    expert witnesses testified that shoe impressions left on papers in front
    of the filing cabinet in the garage, where the ammunition was stored, matched
    the appellant’s Nike running shoes.  The shoes were well worn and had distinct
    wear patterns.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    shoe imprints were made in dust on papers that had fallen to the floor.  The
    papers were not on the floor earlier in the afternoon.  Witnesses familiar
    with Jim Perlett’s habits testified that he kept the garage neat and that
    he almost certainly would not have left a pile of paper on the floor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant had first told the police that he was wearing his Nike running
    shoes the night of the murders.  The day after the shootings, however, he
    asked the police whether they could get impressions from footwear in the
    same way as they could from fingerprints and footprints.  The next day he
    told his sister to “correct” the information he had first told the police
    and instead tell them that he was wearing a new pair of shoes his mother
    had bought for him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    the appellant’s sister nor his fiancée ever saw him wearing his new shoes.  The
    appellant’s closest friend, who was out with him the night of the murders,
    testified that the appellant was wearing his Nike running shoes.  The appellant
    wore these shoes so often that their battered condition was an ongoing joke
    with his friends. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii) The partially used box
      of ammunition in the basement pantry</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that he was in the basement when he awoke to the sound
    of gunshots.  On his account, the intruder never came into the basement.  Yet
    a partially used box of ammunition (of the type used in the murder weapon)
    was found in the basement pantry.  No other partial or empty boxes of this
    type of ammunition were found anywhere else at the scene.  The number of
    shells left in the box (forty) and the number used in committing the murders
    (ten) added up to a full box of fifty<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>.  The
    box of shells was found in a container of hunting gear.  Items surrounding
    the box were dusty; but the box itself was free of dust, suggesting it had
    been placed there recently.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    two pieces of physical evidence – the shoe prints and the partially used
    box of ammunition – pointed strongly to the appellant’s guilt.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>4. Evidence that undermined
      the appellant’s story about an intruder</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to its inherent implausibility, numerous pieces of circumstantial
    evidence and the lack of any supporting evidence undermine the appellant’s
    story about an intruder.  The following are some of the evidentiary considerations
    contradicting the appellant’s account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    there was no physical evidence supporting the appellant’s claim that he struggled
    with the intruder.  Nothing in the house was destroyed, damaged or even disturbed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    although the appellant claimed that he shook his parents after he was shot,
    there was no blood on his parents’ bed covers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the blood evidence did not square with the timing of the appellant’s account.  The
    appellant called the 911 operator at 5:11 a.m.  He testified that just a
    couple of minutes had elapsed from the time he heard the shots until he made
    the call.  The blood evidence showed otherwise.  The police constable arrived
    at the scene at 5:16 a.m. and viewed the deceased by 5:20 a.m.  Both he and
    another constable observed that the blood on Jim Perlett’s face was dried
    and crusted.  It was no longer flowing and it was dark.  The forensic pathologist,
    Dr. Pan, testified that the blood that the constables observed on Jim Perlett’s
    face likely would have been there for 20 to 30 minutes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also,
    a large amount of the appellant’s blood was found on the floor of his parents’ bedroom
    and in the kitchen.  In Dr. Pan’s, opinion it would take fifteen minutes
    or more for that amount of blood to flow from the appellant’s wound.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the appellant claimed that he turned the light on in his parents’ bedroom
    after he was shot.  Yet, there was no blood on the light switch, though a
    good deal of blood from the appellant’s wound was found on the floor of his
    parents’ bedroom.  Moreover, when the appellant turned the kitchen light
    on as the police arrived, he did leave blood on that light switch.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    the Perletts’ two dogs would have likely have reacted to the presence of
    an intruder.  Yet, they were silent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sixth,
    the partially used box of ammunition was found in the basement of the house.  The
    appellant, however, testified that the intruder never went down to the basement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seventh,
    the gun locker contained several pistols.  There was no evidence that the
    locker had been searched.  Yet, the killer took the one pistol that could
    be used as a semi-automatic weapon.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>5. Evidence showing that the
      appellant repeatedly gave inconsistent accounts of what occurred and made
      false statements in order to mislead the police</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant told his story many times, first to the 911 operator, then to the
    police, and then to friends.  Throughout his various accounts he maintained
    that he was shot by an intruder.  But his account of the surrounding details
    varied considerably.  These variations included the following: </p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>How
    he got the gun: first he said that he grabbed it from the intruder; in a
    later account he said that the intruder dropped it;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether
    there was one intruder or more than one;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    kind of weapon that he was shot with; and</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    in the house he was shot: in some accounts he said that he was shot on the
    main floor landing; in other accounts he said that he was shot as he climbed
    the stairs to the second floor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also made false statements reflecting an intent to mislead, and “planted” exculpatory
    suggestions intended to be given to the police.  A few of the more cogent
    statements and suggestions were the following:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    he was in the hospital, the appellant told a friend that he had lost his
    keys, including his key to the gun locker.  He said that he had gone to the
    Fort Frances General Supply Store to get duplicates made, left keys there,
    and never picked them up.  The Crown called the owner and three employees
    from the store to establish that the appellant’s statement to his friend
    was false.</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Knowing
    that his sister was going to be interviewed by the police, the appellant
    told her to tell them that he was wearing his new shoes when he went out
    on the night of the murders.  As I have already noted, all the evidence,
    including the appellant’s initial statement to the police, established that
    he was wearing his old Nike running shoes the night of the murders.  Prints
    from these shoes at the foot of the filing cabinet where the ammunition for
    the murder weapon was stored strongly implicated the appellant in the shootings.</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    he was in the hospital the appellant told his sister Kelly Perlett that a
    few days before the murders their father had commented about some keys missing
    from his key ring.  Kelly did not recollect her father saying anything about
    missing keys.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    cumulative effect of these five planks of the Crown’s case
    – especially, in my view, the first three planks – points inexorably to the
    appellant’s guilt.  Nonetheless, it is still necessary to assess whether
    any of the appellant’s grounds of appeal calls into question the reliability
    of the verdicts or the fairness of the appellant’s trial. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>C. THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1. The trial judge took away
      the theory of the defence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence’s theory was that a masked intruder shot Mr. and Mrs. Perlett.  The
    defence argued that the trial judge’s charge took away this theory.  The
    argument has two branches.  One branch concerns three specific pieces of
    evidence that the defence contended supported its intruder theory: missing
    beer in the refrigerator; unidentified fingerprints on the gun locker; and
    unidentified DNA on the appellant’s sweatshirt.  The appellant submits that
    the trial judge devalued this evidence supporting the defence by cautioning
    the jury not to speculate about it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second branch of the argument concerns the defence’s contention that the
    police’s investigation was marred by tunnel vision.  The defence argued that
    from the beginning the police tried to build a case against the appellant
    and ignored other possibilities.  The appellant submits that the trial judge
    failed to instruct the jury how to relate the absence of evidence arising
    from gaps in the Crown’s case to the burden of proof.  I will deal with each
    branch of this argument. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(a)            Inference and
      speculation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not convinced that the trial judge took away the defence theory by cautioning
    the jury not to speculate.  In his closing argument, defence counsel invited
    the jury to find that several pieces of evidence – the missing beer, the
    unidentified prints and the unidentified DNA among them – established “positive
    proof of innocence” or showed “the stamp of the killer”.  Perhaps because
    of the way the defence, and indeed the Crown, put their closing arguments,
    early in his charge the trial judge instructed the jury, properly in my view,
    on the distinction between inference and speculation.  He did so in part
    to warn the jury not to convict the appellant on guess work:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I should also caution you that an inference is
    a much stronger kind of determination than conjecture or speculation.  If
    there are no proven facts from which an inference can be logically drawn,
    it is impossible to draw an inference; at best you would be speculating or
    guessing – and that is not good enough.  No accused person, and certainly
    Mr. Jamie Perlett before you in this case, should ever be convicted on a
    guess, no matter how shrewd that guess might be. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also gave specific examples of inferences both the Crown and
    the defence had asked the jury to draw, which he suggested were not supported
    by the evidence.  These general instructions were balanced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    two of the examples used by the trial judge dealt with two of the pieces
    of evidence the defence relied on to support the appellants’ account of an
    intruder: the missing beer and the unidentified fingerprints.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i) The missing beer</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jim
    Perlett had put a new case of beer in a refrigerator in the garage the morning
    before the murders occurred.  After the murders, several bottles in the case
    were empty.  The appellant may have had one beer, but a testing of his blood
    showed no excess alcohol.  No evidence was led to suggest that anyone else
    had drunk this beer.  The defence argued to the jury that they were entitled
    to infer the intruder drank the beer.  The trial judge, however, suggested
    that this argument was speculative:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Brodsky, in his closing, asked you to consider
    that the intruder may have consumed the beer that was apparently missing
    in the garage.  The only facts you have are that a full box was placed in
    the garage on Thursday morning and that when it was checked following the
    killings, the box was partially empty.  You cannot infer from that any particular
    individual who may have drank the beer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    instruction is literally correct but the example is, perhaps, unfortunate.  I
    think the jury was entitled to infer that an intruder drank the missing beer.  The
    trial judge did not entirely preclude the jury from drawing this inference.  When
    reviewing for the jury the many pieces of evidence the defence relied on
    as “positive evidence of innocence”, the trial judge included “that someone
    disposed of up to twelve beers and returned the empty bottles to its case.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Still,
    an instruction from the trial judge ordinarily carries more weight with the
    jury than does a review of the defence’s position.  See for example, <i>R.
    v. Belowitz</i> (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A).  Therefore, although
    by the end of the charge, the inference from the missing beer sought by the
    defence was left for the jury to consider, they might have been discouraged
    from doing so by the trial judge’s earlier instruction not to speculate.  However,
    I consider the inference very weak at best.  If the trial judge’s charge
    on the missing beer amounted to a legal error, it was not a serious error.  I
    would apply the proviso to it.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii) Unidentified fingerprints</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police found fingerprints on the gun locker that they could not identify.  They
    ruled out family and known friends of the Perletts.  The defence claimed
    that the fingerprints were those of the intruder.  Early in his charge, however,
    the trial judge told the jury, “…you have evidence about an unidentified
    fingerprint on the gun vault.  The evidence is just that and no more.  It
    is an unidentified print.  And you must not speculate in any way as to who
    that print may belong to.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant complains that this instruction eliminated from the jury’s consideration
    a legitimate inference available to them.  However, especially in the light
    of the appellant’s evidence about the intruder, I think that the trial judge
    was correct to caution the jury as he did.  The appellant testified that
    the intruder was wearing gloves to conceal his identity.  As Crown counsel
    pointed out, it seems highly speculative, if not silly, to think that the
    intruder would have removed his gloves before touching the gun cabinet.  The
    reality is that any number of persons could have touched that cabinet and
    left a fingerprint.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    despite his initial caution to the jury, later in his charge the trial judge
    listed “the presence of an unidentified fingerprint on a restricted access
    locker where the murder weapon was stored before the killings” as one of
    the pieces of evidence the defence relied on to support its intruder theory.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(iii) Unidentified DNA</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    small sample of unidentified DNA mixed in with the appellant’s blood was
    found on the sweatshirt the appellant wore the night of the murders.  The
    defence contended that this DNA may have come from the intruder.  The appellant
    submits that the trial judge also incorrectly took this inference away from
    the jury.  I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge made no mention of the unidentified DNA except for listing it
    as another piece of evidence on which the defence relied.  Moreover, I cannot
    see that the inference the defence sought to draw is at all reasonable.  The
    head of biology at the Centre of Forensic Sciences testified that a mixed
    DNA sample is “very common” and could result even from “talking in an animated
    fashion.”  Moreover, I find it hard to fathom how the appellant’s submission
    squares with his own description of the intruder as fully clothed, gloved,
    and wearing a ski mask over his face.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overall,
    I am not persuaded that the trial judge’s charge on the distinction between
    legitimate inference and speculation or the examples he used to illustrate
    the distinction so undermined the defence that it deprived the appellant
    of a fair trial.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(b)            Tunnel vision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argued that because of the police’s tunnel vision and resulting
    failure to properly investigate the crime, there were gaps in the Crown’s
    case against him.  For example, the empty beer bottles in the garage refrigerator
    were not tested for fingerprints or DNA, and the employees from the store
    where the gun locker was bought were not called to possibly shed light on
    the unidentified fingerprints.  The appellant submits that the trial judge
    failed to properly instruct the jury on how these gaps in the Crown’s case – the
    absence of evidence – could give rise to a reasonable doubt.  I do not accept
    this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Bero</i> (2000), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 545 at 563-4, this Court said that
      although a jury was not entitled to speculate, it was entitled to consider
      whether the Crown’s failure to investigate or preserve evidence raised
      a reasonable doubt.  In <i>Bero</i>, however, the trial judge removed from
      the jury’s consideration whether the absence of evidence could raise a
      reasonable doubt.  In contrast, in this case the trial judge correctly
      instructed the jury that a reasonable doubt could arise from the absence
      of evidence.  And, although the trial judge properly told the jury not
      to speculate why certain witnesses were not called, he did not instruct
      them to ignore any gaps in the Crown’s case.  He referred expressly to
      what the defence characterized as a
    “misguided police investigation” and to the alleged police failures suggesting
    that characterization.  Perhaps the trial judge could have done more to relate
    the defence position to the burden of proof, but in my view this aspect of
    his charge was certainly adequate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    I was not persuaded of any obvious or glaring deficiencies in the police
    investigation.  Criticism in hindsight is always easy.  But, for example,
    blaming the prosecution for failing to call the employees of the store where
    the gun locker was purchased seems to me to be a counsel of perfection, if
    not of excess.  Blaming the police for failing to test the empty beer bottles
    for fingerprints or DNA might have been a cogent criticism were the Crown’s
    case based on the appellant’s exclusive opportunity.  However, the Crown’s
    case was based not on exclusive opportunity, but on insider exclusive opportunity,
    which is quite different.  Overall I am not satisfied that the defence’s
    case was unfairly removed from the jury’s consideration.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2. The trial judge erred in
      instructing the jury on motive</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge told the jury that they may consider whether the appellant had
    a financial motive to murder his parents.  The appellant contends that in
    doing so the trial judge erred in two respects.  First, he submits that the
    trial judge should not have left with the jury the question whether the appellant
    had a motive for murder because the appellant’s dependence on his parents
    was consistent with a normal family relationship.  Second, he submits that
    the trial judge erred by failing to relate the evidence of the appellant’s
    normal family relationship to the absence of motive.  I do not agree with
    either submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the first submission, motive was not an essential part of the Crown’s case.  And
    the appellant was not in dire financial straits.  But he had often borrowed
    money from his mother.  Moreover, because of his financial situation, he
    needed his parents’
    help to move with his fiancée to Alberta, and his parents had withheld their
    support.  The appellant knew, as well, that he stood to benefit financially
    from his parents’ death, as his mother had inherited some money.  Thus there
    was evidence of motive, though I accept that the evidence was not strong.  Nonetheless,
    as the evidence existed, the trial judge had the discretion to leave it for
    the jury to consider whether they viewed it as evidence of motive, and if
    so, what weight to give it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    decided to charge the jury on the evidence of motive, the trial judge did
    so in neutral terms.  If anything, he devalued the evidence by his following
    instructions:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s request to borrow money from his uncle after his parents’ death
    was insignificant;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    suggestion that the appellant resented his parents was speculative;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was no evidence to contradict the appellant’s testimony that he was making
    the loan payments on one of his cars;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was no evidence to show that the appellant did not buy insurance on any of
    the three cars he owned because he could not afford to do so; and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the appellant knew of his mother’s inheritance, he did not know the specific
    amount.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In my view the trial judge’s
    charge on motive was fair.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the second submission, the trial judge expressly instructed the jury that “…if
    you are of the view there is no motive established, or you have a reasonable
    doubt concerning the presence of motive, that is a circumstance which you
    might take into account as supportive of innocence.”  In another part of
    his charge the trial judge also told the jury that the appellant had a typical
    or normal family relationship with his parents.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s complaint, however, is that the trial judge failed to put those
    instructions together – in other words, he failed to put his instructions
    on the Perletts’ normal family relationship in a proper context.  The appellant
    says that the trial judge should have told the jury that the evidence of
    a normal family relationship was a strong piece of circumstantial evidence
    from which the jury could infer an absence of motive.  From the absence of
    motive, the jury could also infer that the appellant was unlikely to have
    committed the murders. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge did not expressly connect the Perlett family relationship
    to the question of motive, I think that the connection would have been obvious
    to the jury.  The trial judge told the jury at some length about the “normal”
    relationship between the appellant and his family:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>One of the other circumstances, aspects of circumstantial
    evidence, which you may take into account is the relationship between Jamie
    and his family.  You have heard that in all respects the Perlett family seemed
    to be what we would certainly call normal.  Kelly described nothing unusual
    in terms of the relationships of her family.  And her evidence, I would suggest,
    shows nothing other than a typical family relationship between parents and
    teenagers.  Kelly said that her relationship with Jamie was good and she
    did not see anything out of the ordinary in the relationship between Jamie
    and her parents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this part of his charge the trial judge did not say that the Perletts normal
    family relationship was evidence of absence of motive.  But we must credit
    the jury with some common sense.  Any reasonable juror would have questioned
    why a teenager in a typical relationship with his parents would murder them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    adequacy of the trial judge’s instructions on motive is supported by defence
    counsel’s position at trial.  In the pre-charge conference, defence counsel
    requested two instructions: that there was no evidence the appellant resented
    his parents for requiring him to prove himself before assisting him financially
    with his schooling; and that an inference of absence of motive was available
    on the evidence.  The trial judge satisfied both these requests.  Not surprisingly,
    defence counsel did not object to the trial judge’s charge on motive.  I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3. The trial judge erred in
      instructing the jury on post-offence conduct and in leaving to the jury
      demeanour evidence as post-offence conduct capable of supporting an inference
      of guilt</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in his instructions
    on the appellant’s post-offence conduct.  This ground of appeal has two branches:  the
    trial judge did not give the jury enough guidance on how to assess whether
    the appellant’s inconsistent accounts and allegedly false statements could
    be used as circumstantial evidence of guilt; and the trial judge failed to
    instruct the jury that it should not use the appellant’s demeanour after
    the shootings to infer guilt.  I will deal separately with the two branches.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(i)            The appellant’s
      post-offence statement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    assess whether the trial judge sufficiently assisted the jury to evaluate
    the appellant’s post-offence statements I will briefly summarize what the
    trial judge did tell them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge began by telling the jury that to use the appellant’s post-offence
    statements as circumstantial evidence pointing to guilt, they had to find
    that the appellant made the statements, that the statements were false or
    concocted, and that they were intended to mislead.  The appellant does not
    complain about these instructions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then left two categories of the appellant’s post-offence statements
    for the jury to consider: the inconsistencies in his accounts of what occurred;
    and his allegedly false statements and exculpatory suggestions.  I have referred
    to both categories earlier in these reasons in reviewing the Crown’s case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge told the jury that he was not going to review all of the inconsistencies
    because they had been reviewed by counsel in their closing addresses.  He
    did, however, specifically remind the jury of the appellant’s allegedly false
    statements: his statement to his friend about taking keys to the supply store
    for duplicating, his statement to his sister about his shoes, and his statement
    to his sister about his father’s missing keys.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    the trial judge also expressly cautioned the jury that they need not find
    the statements false in the ways that the Crown had alleged.  He urged the
    jury to consider the circumstances in which the appellant made the statements,
    that the statements were not recorded, and whether the witnesses were recalling
    what the appellant said or rather what they understood him to have said.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also directed the jury to consider other reasonable explanations: “I
    caution you not to jump too fast in coming to a conclusion that just because
    a false statement was made, that it was necessarily made to conceal guilt
    or divert suspicion.  You must consider whether there are any other reasonable
    explanations.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me that the trial judge’s charge on post-offence conduct was balanced
    and gave the jury considerable guidance on how to assess the appellant’s
    statements.  The appellant, however, contends that the trial judge needed
    to go farther than he did in two ways.  First, he should have told the jury
    that they were entitled to infer fabrication from the giving of inconsistent
    statements only if the inconsistencies were material or compelling.  Second,
    he should have told the jury that the appellant did not admit to making two
    of the false statements the Crown attributed to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inconsistencies
    in a witness’ account will be relevant to credibility.  However, only material
    or compelling inconsistencies are capable of giving rise to an inference
    of fabrication.  See <i>R. v. Bennett</i> (2003), 179 C.C.C. (3d) 244 (Ont.
    C.A.) at para. 115.  This limitation helps ensure that a jury does not automatically
    equate disbelief of an accused’s statement with an accused’s guilt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did list several areas of inconsistency in the appellant’s account:
    where the appellant was standing when he met the intruder, how he got the
    gun, when he went upstairs, what shoes he was wearing, and the timing of
    his 911 call.  Ideally, the trial judge should also have told the jury that
    they could infer fabrication from these inconsistencies only if they were
    satisfied that the inconsistencies were compelling.  However, I doubt that
    this further instruction would have benefited the appellant.  If he gave
    the requested instructions, he likely would have also have told the jury
    that if they found the inconsistencies compelling they could infer the appellant
    could not keep his story straight because that story was false.  This was
    a cogent argument for the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellant did not admit making a statement to his friend about getting
    duplicate keys or a statement to his sister about his father’s missing keys,
    he did not deny making these statements.  He simply claimed that he could
    not remember making them.  The trial judge put the appellant’s position a
    little differently: “Jamie’s own evidence was that he acknowledged that he
    didn’t say that anybody was lying.”  I do not think that much turns on this
    difference.  By far the most important of the appellant’s statements was
    his direction to his sister to inform the police that he was wearing his
    new shoes, not his old Nike running shoes, the night of the murders.  That
    statement the appellant did acknowledge making.  I would not give effect
    to this branch of the appellant’s argument on post-offence conduct.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii)            Demeanour evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second branch of this ground of appeal concerns what the defence characterizes
    as demeanour evidence.  In his closing argument, the Crown pointed out that
    the appellant failed to call out to his parents after he was shot, and that
    he failed to call up to ask if they were all right or if they had been shot.  The
    Crown argued that the appellant’s lack of interest in his parents was not
    a normal human reaction.  In effect, the appellant’s silence showed that
    he knew his parents were already dead because he had killed them.  In his
    charge the trial judge reviewed the Crown’s position by telling the jury “he
    [the Crown] asks you to review areas where Jamie Perlett simply has no explanation
    to offer you for his actions or inactions.”  The trial judge did not otherwise
    instruct the jury on the appellant’s failure to call out for or ask about
    his parents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the Crown’s argument invited the jury to rely on
    evidence of demeanour, which courts now consider an unreliable indicator
    of guilt.  The appellant submits that the trial judge was obliged to instruct
    the jury not to draw any inference from this evidence, or at least to instruct
    them to exercise caution in relying on it.  I agree that the trial judge
    should have done so.  However, I do not consider his failure to do so to
    be a serious error or that it deprived the appellant of a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s opposing argument is that the appellant’s failure to call out to
    his parents goes well beyond the classic “demeanour” evidence that can too
    often be misinterpreted.  The Crown relied on the context, which it says
    it significant.  The appellant showed a lack of concern for his parents before
    their deaths were confirmed.  Yet, on his evidence he cared a lot for his
    mother and his father.  Thus his failure to call out to them after supposedly
    hearing shots upstairs – for which he had no answer – had considerable probative
    value.  In the Crown’s submission, the jury could legitimately infer that
    the appellant showed no concern for his parents because, having killed them,
    he already knew that they were dead.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not think that the Crown’s argument is correct.  The probative value of
    the appellant’s behaviour rests on the assumption that the normal reaction
    of an innocent person in his situation – and, on this account, one who has
    just been severely wounded – would be to call out for his parents.  That
    assumption is suspect.  Our court has cautioned against inferring consciousness
    of guilt from an accused’s silence or unusually calm reaction.  I can do
    no better than to quote the words of Rosenberg J.A. in <i>R. v. Levert</i> (2001),
    159 C.C.C. (3d) 71 (Ont. C.A.) at paras. 26 – 27:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[26] Since it was not suggested that the appellant
    had adopted the allegations, the only possible basis upon which the evidence
    of the appellant’s demeanour on being confronted with the allegation could
    be relevant in this case is that his unusually calm reaction was evidence
    of consciousness of guilt.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[27] The probative value of this type of evidence
    is highly suspect.  In two recent cases of Susan Nelles and Guy Paul Morin
    use of the accuseds’ demeanour was found to have played a part in the wrongful
    prosecution.  The <i>Report of The Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy
    Paul Morin</i>, 1998, vol. 2, pp. 1142 to 1150, contains an extensive discussion
    of the dangers of admitting such demeanour evidence.  The expert and other
    evidence introduced at the Commission strongly suggests that this evidence
    can be highly suspect and should be admitted at a criminal trial with caution.  Perceptions
    of guilt based on demeanour are likely to depend upon highly subjective impressions
    that may be difficult to convey to the jury and in any event the significance
    of the reaction will often be equivocal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the potential prejudicial effect of the evidence of the appellant’s behaviour
    likely outweighed its probative value, I do not consider that the trial judge’s
    failure to caution the jury about relying on this evidence caused an unfair
    trial.  Although the Crown made his position clear, he did not overly emphasize
    it.  More important, the trial judge did not instruct the jury that they
    could draw any inference from this evidence.  He simply outlined the Crown’s
    position, and he did so in very general terms.  If the trial judge’s omission
    was an error, it was not a reversible one.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>4. The trial judge erred in
      failing to correct counsel’s invitation to the jury to shift the burden
      of proof</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his cross-examination of the appellant, the Crown asked him who else could
    have shot his parents.  In his closing address to the jury, the Crown called
    on the jury to ask themselves who other than the appellant could have committed
    these murders: “I ask you again.  Who else could have killed Jim and Carole
    Perlett?  And on the basis of everything you have heard and seen in this
    trial, I suggest to you that no one else but Jamie Perlett.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that by this cross-examination and closing argument, the
    Crown shifted the burden of proof to the defence to show that someone other
    than the appellant killed his parents.  Effectively, the Crown invited the
    jury to find the appellant guilty because there were no other suspects.  The
    appellant submits that the Crown’s invitation to the jury was improper and
    that the trial judge was obliged to correct it.  I do not accept this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not consider the Crown’s cross-examination or his closing to have been
    improper.  Instead, in my view, they were fair advocacy.  Moreover the trial
    judge repeatedly and correctly instructed the jury on the burden of proof.  The
    jurors could not have misapprehended their duty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s cross-examination and closing has to be viewed in the context of
    the defence’s intruder theory.  The Crown had to prove the intruder theory
    false.  The implausibility of that theory was central to the Crown’s case.  Thus,
    whether anyone else had a motive to kill the Perletts became a relevant consideration.  The
    appellant, the son of the deceased, might reasonably be expected to know
    whether anyone else had such a motive.  In this context, the Crown’s cross-examination
    was a fair line of questioning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in this context, the Crown’s rhetorical question to the jury “who else could
    have killed Jim and Carole Perlett?” was fair argument.  The Crown built
    its case on exclusive insider opportunity.  It was logical for the Crown
    to point out that Jamie Perlett was the only person with knowledge of the
    house and the location of the murder weapon who had the opportunity to commit
    the murders.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore
    I do not see anything in either the Crown’s cross-examination or the Crown’s
    closing argument that the trial judge was obliged to correct.  Most important,
    in addition to giving the jury the standard charge on reasonable doubt and
    twice instructing them on the principles in <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i> (1991),
    63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.), the trial judge expressly cautioned the jury
    that even though the appellant testified he had no onus or duty to prove
    anything.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You ought, nonetheless, to keep in mind that whether
    or not he gave testimony, there is no onus or duty upon him to prove anything.  The
    onus rather is the other way around.  It rests upon the Crown to provide
    each and every essential element of an offence before a finding of guilt
    can be made in respect of that offence.  Even if you disbelieve every word
    of evidence uttered by Jamie Perlett from the witness box, the onus, rests
    upon the Crown to prove the elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the light of this caution and the trial judge’s unassailable instructions
    on reasonable doubt, the jury could not have misapprehended the Crown’s burden
    of proof.  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>5. The trial judge erred in
      excluding the evidence of Dr. Loftus, or in failing to instruct the jury
      on the frailties of memories formed in traumatic situations</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Elizabeth Loftus is a renowned American psychologist.  She has studied and

    the field.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence sought to call Dr. Loftus as an expert witness for two purposes:
    to establish that a significant minority of the population mistakenly believe
    people are better able to remember details of traumatic events; and to establish
    that a witness to a traumatic event may have false memories of that event.  By
    tendering Dr. Loftus’ opinion evidence, the defence sought to counter the
    Crown’s argument that the appellant’s false statements and inconsistent accounts
    of what occurred showed he had fabricated his intruder story.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge, however, refused to permit the defence to call Dr. Loftus.  The
    appellant submits that he erred in law in doing so because he incorrectly
    applied the test in <i>R. v. Mohan</i> (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (S.C.C.)
    for the admission of expert evidence, and he mischaracterized the nature
    of Dr. Loftus’ evidence.  Alternatively the appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred by failing to include the essence of Dr. Loftus’ evidence in
    his jury charge, as he had said he would.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge heard Dr. Loftus’ proposed testimony on a <i>voir dire</i>.  In
    his ruling he summarized the essence of her testimony concerning people’s
    misconceptions about the memories of those who have had traumatic experiences:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>She testified that studies have shown that a significant
    minority – sometimes as great as fifty percent – of the general population
    have misconceptions about various aspects of human memory.  In particular
    she testified that studies have shown that it is common for lay people to
    believe that traumatic experiences will leave participants with an imprinted
    memory of that event.  However, she said that scientific evidence in fact
    contradicts this belief.  She testified that memory of violent events is
    in fact weaker than that of non-violent events.  Moreover, she said that
    witnesses to traumatic events often have false or illusory memories of these
    events.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then applied the <i>Mohan</i> test for the admission of expert
    evidence and decided to exclude Dr. Loftus’ testimony.  The <i>Mohan</i> test
    turns on four criteria: a properly qualified expert; relevance; necessity;
    and the absence of any exclusionary rule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    not ruling definitively on the first criterion, the trial judge seemed willing
    to accept that “Dr. Loftus’ area of research was an established and recognized
    area of scientific research.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also seemed to accept, albeit reluctantly, that the defence had
    established the second criterion, relevance.  Initially, the trial judge
    held that as the defence tendered Dr. Loftus’
    testimony to explain inconsistencies in the appellant’s account, the defence
    was simply seeking to bolster the appellant’s credibility.  Ordinarily evidence
    used solely to bolster credibility is inadmissible.  However, the trial judge
    quoted McLachlin J.’s reasons in <i>R. v. Marquard</i> (1993), 85 C.C.C.
    (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at 228-9, in which she said that “expert evidence of human
    conduct and the psychological and physical factors which may lead to certain
    behaviour relevant to credibility is admissible provided the testimony goes
    beyond the ordinary experience of the trier of fact.”  This type of expert
    evidence puts the witness’ testimony in its proper context.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge therefore accepted that although “Dr. Loftus’s proposed testimony
    does indirectly go toward bolstering Mr. Perlett’s credibility, it might
    be admissible if that testimony is needed because the problem is beyond their
    [the jury’s] ordinary experience.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s decision to exclude Dr. Loftus’ evidence was based on his application
    of the third criterion of the <i>Mohan</i> test, necessity.  He ruled that
    her evidence was not
    “necessary.”  He correctly stated the test for necessity: for expert evidence
    to be admissible “the subject matter of the inquiry must be such that ordinary
    people are unlikely to form a correct judgment about it, if unassisted by
    persons with special knowledge.”  He held that Dr. Loftus’ proposed evidence
    did not meet this test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge noted that Dr. Loftus could not say how large a segment of the
    population shared a misconception about memory of traumatic experiences.  The
    most she could say was a significant minority, perhaps as high as fifty percent.  The
    defence argued that her evidence suggested that at least some members of
    the jury were likely to have this opinion.  The trial judge, however, was
    not convinced “that it is necessary to have expert opinion evidence every
    time it is statistically likely that a juror will have a relevant misconception
    about human behaviour”.  He referred to this Court’s decision in <i>R. v.
    McIntosh</i> (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 394-5 where Finlayson J.A. wrote
    that most people were aware that memories of brief and stressful incidents
    may be faulty.  Thus the trial judge concluded that all that was needed was
    to caution the jury not to “draw too hasty a conclusion from any inconsistencies
    they may perceive in Mr. Perlett’s statements.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also dealt with the fourth <i>Mohan</i> criterion and concluded
    that it provided an alternative basis to exclude Dr. Loftus’ testimony.  In
    his view the cost of admitting the testimony, including its potential to
    overwhelm the jury, substantially outweighed its “marginal probative value.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant makes two complaints about the trial judge’s ruling on the admissibility
    of Dr. Loftus’ testimony.  His first complaint is that the trial judge wrongly
    characterized her testimony as being relevant only to bolster his credibility.  I
    do not agree.  As my summary of the trial judge’s reasons endeavoured to
    show, the trial judge did acknowledge that although Dr. Loftus’ evidence
    was relevant to the appellant’s credibility, it might still be admissible
    to put the appellant’s evidence in a proper context.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s second and main complaint is that the trial judge misapplied
    the test for necessity.  The appellant argues that to be admissible, Dr.
    Loftus’ evidence does not have to go as far as to demonstrate that every
    juror would likely have this misconception.  Instead necessity will be met
    if the risk of misconception among the jurors is material.  Here, the appellant
    argues, the risk is material because Dr. Loftus’
    scientific findings show that a significant portion of the population, albeit
    less than fifty percent, perceive that human memories of traumatic experiences
    will be keen and clear.  And, critically, the perception is a misconception
    because it does not accord with the scientific evidence, but runs counter
    to it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a cogent and attractive argument.  I found it a difficult argument to
    resolve.  However, two things support the trial judge’s ruling that Dr. Loftus’
    evidence does not meet the necessity criterion.   First, Dr. Loftus’ evidence
    about the extent of the population harbouring this misconception was not
    terribly precise; indeed it was quite vague.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge’s ruling was consistent with this Court’s judgments in <i>McIntosh</i> and <i>R
    v. M.(B.)</i> (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 353.  Admittedly, Dr. Loftus’ evidence
    did not suffer from some of the frailties of the proposed experts in those
    two cases.  Those frailties, however, related to the first <i>Mohan</i> criterion,
    a properly qualified expert.  On the necessity criterion, both Finlayson
    J.A. in <i>McIntosh</i> and Rosenberg J.A. in <i>M.(B.)</i> accept that jurors
    are likely to understand that people have faulty perceptions and memories
    of brief and stressful events.  Contrary to Dr. Loftus’
    opinion, these cases hold that it is within jurors’ normal experience, not
    outside their experience, and thus expert assistance is not necessary.  In
    the light of these cases and the vagueness of Dr. Loftus’ evidence I am not
    persuaded that the trial judge erred in exercising his discretion to exclude
    her testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s alternative submission is that the trial judge erred by failing
    to incorporate the essence of Dr. Loftus’ evidence in his jury charge, as
    he said he would do.  Although the trial judge did not say that he would
    do so, this submission has some merit.  As Rosenberg J.A. said in <i>M.(B.)</i> warning
    or reminding the jury about the frailties of particular kinds of evidence
    is part of the trial judge’s duty.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case the trial judge did give the jury some guidance.  For example,
    at the beginning of his charge, he listed some questions the jurors should
    ask themselves when assessing the credibility of a witness.  Among these
    questions were: “[w]as the witness, because of the turmoil surrounding the
    event at the time it occurred, easily and understandably in error as to detail?
    Was it a situation of panic or a relatively calm period?”  Later in his charge – in
    a passage that I referred to earlier – the trial judge cautioned the jury,
    largely in the terms that he had promised in his ruling: “I caution you not
    to jump too fast in coming to a conclusion that just because a false statement
    was made, that it was necessarily made to conceal guilt or to divert suspicion.  You
    must consider whether there are any other reasonable explanations.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    those instructions were helpful, in my view the trial judge could have better
    assisted the jury had he directly reminded them that persons may have faulty
    memories and misperception of traumatic incidents.  He probably should have
    focussed on the inconsistencies in the appellant’s various accounts of his
    struggle with the intruder, and cautioned the jury that in traumatic situations
    a person’s recall of detail is not as accurate as one might normally expect.  Thus
    the jury should not necessarily infer that the inconsistencies are evidence
    of a false story.  However, I do not consider the trial judge’s failure to
    give these additional instructions to amount to legal error.  This aspect
    of his charge was adequate.  Moreover, as I discuss later in these reasons,
    even if I am wrong, I would cure any error by applying the proviso in s.
    686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>6. The trial judge should not

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown led expert opinion evidence from Dr. Peter Pan, a forensic pathologist.  He
    gave an opinion about the amount of time that must have elapsed from when
    Mr. and Mrs. Perlett were shot until the police arrived.  His opinion was
    based on the amount of blood the deceased lost and on changes in the colour
    and consistency of their blood.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel did not challenge the admissibility of Dr. Pan’s evidence and did
    not call any expert evidence to refute it.  Now, on appeal, the appellant
    contends that his trial counsel<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a> made an error in judgment – falling
    short of incompetence – by failing to challenge the admissibility of Dr.
    Pan’s testimony.  The appellant argues that Dr. Pan’s opinion evidence was
    unreliable and had no scientific foundation, yet it was crucial to the Crown’s
    case.  He submits that the trial judge erred by failing to exclude this evidence.
    Alternatively, the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to properly
    instruct the jury about the weaknesses in Dr. Pan’s opinion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    connection with this ground of appeal, the appellant asks leave to introduce
    fresh evidence.  The proposed fresh evidence consists of an agreed statement
    of facts, which explains defence counsel’s strategy in dealing with Dr. Pan’s
    evidence, and the affidavit and testimony of a forensic pathologist, Dr.
    Chiasson, which casts doubt on Dr. Pan’s opinion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that I will elaborate on, I would not give effect to this ground
    of appeal.  I see no basis in the trial record to exclude Dr. Pan’s evidence.  The
    trial judge’s charge on the weaknesses in Dr. Pan’s testimony was adequate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proposed evidence of Dr. Chiasson does not meet the criteria in <i>Palmer
    and Palmer v. The Queen</i> (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (S.C.C.) for the admission
    of fresh evidence on appeal.  Although his evidence is undoubtedly credible
    and relevant to the plausibility of the appellant’s intruder story, it fails
    to meet the due diligence criterion, and more important, even if admitted,
    could not reasonably be expected to have affected the verdicts.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii) The context</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that he called the 911 operator within “a couple of minutes” of
    the gunshots.  The police arrived about five minutes later.  The Crown led
    evidence, principally from Dr. Pan, to contradict the appellant’s testimony.  The
    Crown’s evidence, if accepted, showed a significant gap in time between when
    Mr. and Mrs. Perlett were shot and when the police arrived.  The Crown relied
    on Dr. Pan’s evidence, along with numerous other pieces of circumstantial
    evidence, to establish that the appellant made up his story about an intruder.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(iii) Dr. Pan’s evidence and
      the Crown’s argument on it</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Pan conducted the post-mortem examination of Mr. and Mrs. Perlett but he
    did not go to the crime scene.  His opinion evidence on the passage of time
    was partly based on his observation of photographs of the deceased, and on
    the testimony of two police officers and a paramedic who had answered the
    911 call.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown produced several photographs of the crime scene taken more than ten
    hours after the murders.  The victims’ blood, as shown in these photographs,
    was described as clotted, dried and dark brown.  The two officers and the
    paramedic testified that these photographs represented what they saw when
    they arrived at the Perletts’ house.  One officer testified that he saw no
    blood flowing from either Mrs. Perlett’s or Mr. Perlett’s body.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    in part on these photographs, Dr. Pan gave an opinion about the passage of
    time based on blood loss (“pooling”), blood clotting and blood drying.  On
    blood pooling, however, the probative value of his opinion was undermined
    by two important concessions he made during cross-examination.  In his examination
    in chief, Dr. Pan initially gave an opinion that the victims had lost or
    shed a
    “considerable” amount of blood, suggesting that their hearts would have had
    to beat for at least thirty minutes after they were shot and before the police
    arrived.  In cross-examination, however, Dr. Pan acknowledged that the pooling
    of blood is not an exact science, and he reduced his estimate of thirty minutes
    or more to fifteen minutes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Pan also retracted his time estimate for blood clotting.  In his examination
    in chief, Dr. Pan opined that it would take eight to eighteen minutes for
    the victims’ blood to clot.  In cross-examination, he conceded that in cases
    of traumatic death blood would clot in three to four minutes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    blood drying, Dr. Pan testified that after blood clots, it changes colour
    from bright red through stages of brown and then to black.   In his opinion
    the “brownish black” colour of the blood in the photographs showed that the
    victims’ blood was “over twenty minutes to half an hour old.”  However, Dr.
    Pan also conceded that colour is “subjective” and that an individual’s view
    of colour resides “only in the eye of the beholder.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the weaknesses in Dr. Pan’s opinion, the Crown relied on his evidence to
    argue that the appellant fabricated his story about an intruder.  The Crown
    invited the jury to find that the passage of time between the gunshots and
    the arrival of the police was at a minimum thirty-five minutes, and more
    likely forty to sixty minutes.  The Crown reached this estimate by adding
    together Dr. Pan’s minimum estimate on blood loss time (fifteen minutes)
    and clotting-drying time (twenty minutes).  Even this conservative estimate
    contradicted the appellant’s story.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(iv) Defence counsel’s trial
      strategy </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellant’s trial counsel brought a motion to exclude Dr. Pan’s evidence.  However,
    he later abandoned the motion, conceded Dr. Pan’s expertise as a forensic
    pathologist, and decided not to object to Dr. Pan’s testimony or to call
    his own expert to challenge it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead,
    defence counsel pursued a different strategy, which appeared to consist of
    three planks.  First, he obtained the Crown’s consent to have Dr. Spencer,
    the surgeon who treated the appellant’s wound, read and adopt the evidence
    of Dr. Tilstone, a forensic serologist.  On the appellant’s pre-trial motion,
    Dr. Tilstone had testified that he knew of no reliable technique to use the
    colour and consistency of blood to measure the passage of time.  At trial,
    as agreed by counsel, Dr. Spencer read and adopted this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    defence counsel obtained the Crown’s agreement and Dr. Pan’s concurrence
    that during his testimony Dr. Pan would adopt the following opinion of Dr.
    Chiasson:
    “the colour and consistency of blood at the scene of traumatic death are
    not reliable indices upon which one can rely to establish the post-mortem
    interval/time of death.”  Dr. Pan did so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    in cross-examination, defence counsel extracted concessions from Dr. Pan.  These
    included Dr. Pan’s concession that blood pooling is not an exact science,
    the reduction in his time estimates, and his concession that the appellant
    also lost a great volume of blood, which would have taken a long period of
    time to shed.  The defence used this last concession to argue that Dr. Pan’s
    opinion showed the appellant and his parents were shot close in time to each
    other, and that this supported the appellant’s story.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(v) The trial record affords
      no basis to exclude Dr. Pan’s evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant now submits that his lawyer should have objected to the admissibility
    of Dr. Pan’s evidence and that the trial judge should have excluded this
    evidence because it failed to meet the <i>Mohan</i> test.  Throughout his
    argument, the appellant emphasized that he was not suggesting his trial lawyer
    was incompetent or ineffectively represented him.  Instead, he said simply
    that his lawyer had made a mistake or an error in judgment by failing to
    argue that Dr. Pan’s evidence was not reliable and lacked a scientific foundation.  The
    appellant points to two specific areas of unreliability: Dr. Pan’s admission
    that the pooling of blood is not an exact science and the absence of any
    accurate measure of the blood lost by either victim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    think that the argument for excluding Dr. Pan’s testimony is difficult if
    not virtually impossible to sustain when the defence chose not to challenge
    the admissibility of that testimony at trial.  As Doherty J.A. explained
    in <i>Bero</i> at paras. 12-13: “an appellant who can show no more than a
    possibility that evidence may have been excluded had it been challenged has
    not established an error in law or a miscarriage of justice.”  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[12] It would be wrong for this court to undertake
    the analysis required to decided whether the evidence was admissible based
    on a record in which none of the relevant considerations were explored because
    the defence chose not to litigate the admissibility of the evidence at trial.  Absent
    any suggestion of ineffective representation at trial, or some other adequate
    explanation for the absence of any objection to admissibility at trial, I
    would not give effect to an argument that comes down to the contention that
    an accused should receive a new trial on the ground that had he chosen to
    challenge the admissibility of evidence at trial he might have been successful.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[13] In so holding, I do not suggest that the failure
    to object at trial is fatal to any challenge to the admissibility of evidence
    at trial.  Our law does not require timely objection as a condition precedent
    to appellate complaint.  I do hold, however, that an appellant who can show
    no more than a possibility that evidence may have been excluded had it been
    challenged has not established an error in law or a miscarriage of justice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    passage applies directly to this case.  Dr. Pan is now deceased but in his
    lifetime he performed over 10,000 post-mortem examinations, including 200
    homicides.  The defence conceded his expertise as a forensic pathologist.  Moreover,
    the defence did not impugn Dr. Pan’s ability to appraise the amount of blood
    loss.  The defence did not suggest to Dr. Pan or through other evidence that
    his opinion on the volume of blood loss exceeded the scope of his expertise.  And
    the defence did not suggest to Dr. Pan or through other evidence that his
    opinion based on changes in the consistency and colour of blood lacked a
    scientific foundation.  Whatever weaknesses emerged from Dr. Pan’s testimony
    seem to me to be matters of weight, not admissibility
    – which was the very position taken by defence counsel at trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    Dr. Pan’s agreement with Dr. Chiasson that a forensic pathologist cannot
    determine the post-mortem interval – that is, the time of death – based on
    the colour and consistency of blood did not preclude Dr. Pan’s quite distinct
    opinion on the minimum time required for blood to achieve a certain appearance.  In
    short, I am not persuaded that the trial record affords any basis to now
    exclude Dr. Pan’s evidence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(vi) The trial judge’s charge
      on the weaknesses in Dr. Pan’s opinion was adequate</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to properly instruct the
    jury on the weaknesses in Dr. Pan’s opinion evidence.  I disagree.  In my
    view his charge was at least adequate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant makes two specific complaints and one general complaint about the
    trial judge’s charge.  The two specific complaints are: the trial judge failed
    to correct the Crown’s argument that Dr. Pan’s time estimates for blood pooling
    and for changes in the colour and consistency of blood could be added together
    to produce an overall estimate of the minimum interval of time between the
    shootings and the arrival of the police; and the trial judge failed to instruct
    the jury that the colour and consistency of blood could not be reliably used
    to fix the post-mortem passage of time.  The general complaint is that the
    trial judge failed to warn the jury that they should give no weight to an
    expert opinion if the facts on which the opinion is based are not proven.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not think that the appellant’s specific complaints are well founded.  First,
    although admittedly Dr. Pan’s evidence is not entirely clear, the following
    portion of his testimony supports the Crown’s argument on adding Dr. Pan’s
    time estimates:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q: How does that blood flow
    come to stop?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A: When the heart stops.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q: <i>After the blood flow
      stops</i>, can you describe a process by which – what happened <i>then</i> to
      whatever blood is left on the forehead?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A: Well, a clotting mechanism <i>starts</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    although Dr. Pan agreed with Dr. Chiasson that the colour and consistency
    of blood could not reliably be used to estimate the time of death, he could
    nonetheless give an opinion about the minimum time that must have elapsed
    between the shootings and the arrival of the police.  The two are distinct.
    Dr. Pan could give a conservative estimate on the passage of time, but the
    actual time of death may have occurred much earlier.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave the jury standard instructions on how to evaluate expert
    testimony.  As Dr. Pan’s opinion obviously suffered from underlying factual
    weaknesses, he might well have cautioned the jury that an expert’s opinion
    merits weight only if the underlying facts on which it is based are proven.  The
    trial judge did not do so in the general terms urged by the appellant.  But
    he did specifically instruct the jury on the underlying weaknesses in Dr.
    Pan’s opinion.  For example:</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    cautioned the jury about relying on witnesses’
    observations about the colour of blood;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    reminded the jury that the photographs on which Dr. Pan relied were taken
    hours after the shootings and that the constables were not entirely certain
    that these photographs accurately represented the colour of the blood they
    observed;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    gave other examples where photographs did not represent the true colour of
    objects;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    told the jury that Dr. Pan agreed with Dr. Chiasson’s opinion that blood
    cannot be used to reliably establish the time of death;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    reminded the jury that Dr. Pan “did not attempt in any way” to provide determinative
    evidence of the time of death;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he

  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he
    pointed out the discrepancy between Dr. Pan’s opinion that the appellant

    instructions were undoubtedly helpful to the jury.  They alerted the jury
    to specific weaknesses in both the scientific methodology and the factual
    foundation underlying Dr. Pan’s opinion.  In the light of these instructions,
    I am satisfied that the trial judge’s charge on Dr. Pan’s evidence was at
    least adequate.  Moreover, it could not have escaped the jury’s attention
    that the defence’s cross-examination extracted important concessions from
    Dr. Pan.  I doubt that the jury would have given undue weight to Dr. Pan’s
    opinion.  I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(vi) The motion to introduce

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks leave to introduce as fresh evidence an agreed statement
    of facts explaining defence counsel’s failure to deal adequately with Dr.
    Pan’s evidence, and the affidavit of Dr. Chiasson together with the cross-examination
    on that affidavit.  The Crown filed the affidavit of Jonathan Newman, a forensic
    biologist, to answer Dr. Chiasson’s affidavit.  The appellant does not object
    to admitting Mr. Newman’s affidavit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant asks for leave to introduce this fresh evidence either under the
    test in <i>Palmer,</i> <i>supra</i>, or at least to better evaluate the reliability
    of Dr. Pan’s opinion.  See <i>R. v. W.(W.)</i> (1995), 100 C.C.C. (3d) 225
    (Ont. C.A.).  On either basis I am not persuaded that the fresh evidence
    should be admitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Palmer</i> criteria
    are well established.  Fresh evidence that addresses a factual issue raised
    at trial will be admitted if it meets four criteria: </p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>it
    must not have been available by the exercise of due diligence</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>it

  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>it
    could if believed and taken together with the rest of the evidence reasonably
    be expected to have affected the verdict</p>
  <p>Fresh evidence admitted under <i>Palmer</i> results in a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only
    the first and fourth <i>Palmer</i> criteria are in issue on the appellant’s
    motion.  The Crown accepts that the proposed evidence is relevant to the
    plausibility of the appellant’s intruder story and is credible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will deal first with the due diligence criterion.  Although the failure to
    exercise due diligence is not fatal in cases where the interests of justice
    call for the admission of fresh evidence, it nonetheless remains an important
    criterion.  As Doherty J.A. said in <i>R. v. M. (P.S.)</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C.
    (3d) 402 at 411 (Ont. C.A.): “The due diligence criterion is designed to
    preserve the integrity of the process and it must be accorded due weight
    in assessing the admissibility of ‘fresh’ evidence on appeal.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here
    the appellant failed to meet the due diligence criterion.  The proposed fresh
    evidence of Dr. Chiasson was unquestionably available at trial by the exercise
    of due diligence.  The defence was well aware of the “blood issues” about
    which Dr. Pan would testify.  The defence discussed these very issues with
    Dr. Chiasson.  The defence met with Dr. Pan and even obtained his agreement
    to the contents of Dr. Chiasson’s opinion letter.  Having carefully considered
    these “blood issues”, the defence made a tactical or strategic decision not
    to call Dr. Chiasson and instead to impugn Dr. Pan’s evidence on cross-examination.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence now says that its strategy was an error in judgment.  However, the
    reassessment in hindsight of a tactical decision made at trial provides an
    unsatisfactory explanation for the failure to exercise due diligence.  We
    are not being asked to find that this tactical decision resulted in a miscarriage
    of justice, as the appellant does not argue ineffective representation.  It
    seems to me then, the appellant must acknowledge that he failed to meet the
    first criterion of the <i>Palmer</i> test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if this court is willing to excuse the appellant’s failure to exercise due
    diligence, in my view this is not one of those cases where the interests
    of justice call for the admission of the fresh evidence.  The proposed evidence
    of Dr. Chiasson, though credible and relevant, could not reasonably be expected
    to affect the verdicts for two reasons.  First, the fresh evidence does not
    provide any grounds to exclude Dr. Pan’s opinion.  Nor, especially when considered
    together with Mr. Newman’s evidence, does it even significantly undermine
    Dr. Pan’s opinion.  Second, and more important, the fresh evidence relates
    to an issue – the minimum time interval between the shootings and the arrival
    of the police – that was not crucial to the Crown’s case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the murders, Dr. Chiasson was the Chief Pathologist for Ontario.  Later
    he became the Deputy Chief Coroner for Ontario.  He is obviously qualified
    to give opinion evidence in the field of forensic pathology.  I accept that
    in his affidavit, Dr. Chiasson calls into question the reliability of Dr.
    Pan’s time estimates.  He takes issue both with Dr. Pan’s estimate on blood
    loss and with his estimate on clotting and drying.  He summarizes his opinion
    in the following paragraph of his affidavit:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is my view that during his testimony at Mr.
    Perlett’s trial, Dr. Pan ventured into areas which were beyond his expertise.  In
    fact, Dr. Pan ventured into areas that are not within the purview of forensic
    pathology.  It is inconceivable to me, as a forensic pathologist, how Dr.
    Pan could determine the length of time blood loss would have taken in this
    case as there is no scientific basis for such a calculation.  His testimony
    on this issue is, therefore, not reliable.  His testimony regarding the clotting
    and drying processes is equally unreliable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in his cross-examination on the amount of blood loss, Dr. Chiasson seemed
    to soften his opinion somewhat.  He agreed that the Perletts did not die
    instantaneously and that “it did take some time.”  He conservatively estimated
    the time to be up to five minutes.  But he allowed that Dr. Pan’s opinion
    was “not unreasonable” if the blood loss was
    “based solely on the entrance wounds.”  Dr. Chiasson’s real concern was that
    the basis for Dr. Pan’s opinion was not clear to him.  He said, “Dr. Pan
    may well be right, but he could just as well be wrong.  I don’t see the basis
    for the opinion that he has rendered.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    Dr. Chiasson maintained that Dr. Pan’s opinion on clotting and drying was
    unreliable, he acknowledged that his own expertise in that area was limited.  In
    his letter to defence counsel before trial, he said “[p]lease note that my
    personal experience in the area of scene investigation is limited and therefore
    an opinion from a forensic biologist with expertise in blood pattern interpretation
    might be of greater value to you.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s expert, Jonathan Newman, is a forensic biologist.  In his affidavit
    filed in answer to Dr. Chiasson’s evidence, he gives an opinion on clotting
    and drying time based on scientific studies and techniques.  His opinion,
    to a large extent, supports the time estimate given by Dr. Pan and relied
    on by the Crown.  Indeed, Mr. Newman suggests that Dr. Pan’s estimate was
    conservative.  Thus, Mr. Newman says in his affidavit:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>“textual
    authorities in this field support the time range for clotting given by Dr.
    Pan and confirmed by Dr. Chiasson;”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>“Crown
    counsel, in its closing address…, by estimating clotting time at three minutes
    and collapsing it with drying time, urged an extremely conservative view
    of how long the clotting process would have taken;”
    and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>“…in
    my opinion, a conservative estimate of the time to have elapsed that would
    result in the drying of the blood, as observed on the head of the deceased
    in the photographs, would be in excess of 30 minutes.  This does not take
    into account the time for the cessation of the blood flow.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[150]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    the fresh evidence leaves the court with two experts, Dr. Pan and Dr. Chiasson,
    who disagree on the issue of blood loss; and two experts, Dr. Pan and Mr.
    Newman, who largely agree on the issue of blood clotting and drying, and
    one expert, Dr. Chiasson, who does not agree.  I am not persuaded that Dr.
    Chiasson’s opinion, either on its own or taken together with Mr. Newman’s
    opinion, so undermines the reliability of Dr. Pan’s opinion that the interests
    of justice warrant admitting the fresh evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if I were persuaded of the importance of Dr. Chiasson’s opinion, I do not
    regard the issue to which his evidence relates as crucial to the Crown’s
    case.  The evidence relates to the minimum time interval between the shootings
    and the arrival of the police.  That time interval was one of the considerations
    the Crown relied on to argue that the appellant’s intruder story was false.  But
    it was only one consideration. I appreciate that the jury asked several questions
    about Dr. Pan’s evidence.  But the Crown also relied on a litany of other
    considerations, some of which I have listed earlier in these reasons (see
    paragraphs 34 to 36 and 37 to 42) to show that the appellant’s story about
    an intruder was false.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, I do not view the fresh evidence to relate to a crucial or central issue
    in the case.  In my view, it could not reasonably be expected to affect the
    verdicts.  I would dismiss the appellant’s motion to introduce fresh evidence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>D. THE APPLICATION OF SECTION
      686(1)(b)(iii) OF THE CRIMINAL CODE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the trial judge made a “wrong decision on a question of law,” under s.
    686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, this court may dismiss the appeal
    where “it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
    has occurred.”  I have concluded that the trial judge did not make any serious
    errors in his charge to the jury or in his ruling on the admissibility of
    expert evidence.  However, even if I am wrong in that conclusion, I would
    apply s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Code</i> and hold that no substantial wrong
    or miscarriage of justice has occurred.  I would do so because, as I outlined
    at the beginning of these reasons, and using the words of Arbour J. in <i>R.
    v. Khan</i> (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at para. 31 “the evidence
    pointing to the guilt of the accused is so overwhelming that any other verdict
    but a conviction would be impossible.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    other words, not just harmless errors of law, but even serious errors of
    law are amenable to the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) if “the evidence is
    so overwhelming that a trier fact would inevitably convict.”  See <i>R. v.
    S. (P.L.)</i> (1991), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 202.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of
    course, the court must cautious in applying the proviso, particularly if
    the error of law is the improper exclusion of evidence that might be exculpatory.  See <i>R.
    v. Wildman</i> (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.).  But here, even if the
    trial judge erred in excluding Dr. Loftus’
    evidence, I would apply s. 686(1)(b)(iii).  Dr. Loftus’ evidence does not
    touch the three crucial planks of the Crown’s case: an insider must have
    committed the murders; the appellant was the only insider with the opportunity
    to do so; and the physical evidence at the scene pointed to his guilt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    killer was intimately familiar with the Perlett household.  He knew how and
    where to get the murder weapon and the ammunition for it.  The appellant
    was the only person who had both the knowledge and the opportunity.  The
    physical evidence inescapably implicated him.  His distinct shoeprints were
    found on papers in the garage where the gun and ammunition were located.  There
    was no reasonable possibility that those prints could have been left at another
    time by another person.  Once he became aware of the incriminating implication
    of shoeprint evidence, the appellant tried to change his story about what
    shoes he wore on the night of the murders.  A partially empty box of ammunition
    missing the exact number of shells used in the murders was found in the basement
    of the Perlett home where, even on the appellant’s story, the intruder did
    not enter.  This is all overwhelmingly powerful evidence of the appellant’s
    guilt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    contrast, the appellant’s intruder story is inherently implausible and has
    not a shred of any real evidentiary support.  On the appellant’s account,
    a stranger must have entered the Perlett home although it was visibly occupied
    (cars were present and lights were on); found obscurely located keys to the
    gun locker and filing cabinet; figured out that these were the right keys
    even though they were not marked; found the gun locker and filing cabinet
    even though their outward appearance gave no indication that they contained
    guns or ammunition; killed the Perletts without any apparent motive to do
    so; stolen nothing from the household, nor ransacked or disturbed any part
    of it; and then disappeared into the night.  This account of what occurred
    defies credulity.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>E. CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss both the motion to introduce fresh evidence and the appeal.  The
    evidence so overwhelmingly points to the appellant’s guilt that a new trial
    is not warranted.  It is therefore unnecessary to deal with the Crown’s appeal.</p>
