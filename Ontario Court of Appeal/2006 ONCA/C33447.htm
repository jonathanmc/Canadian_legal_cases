    Trafford assigned Mr.&nbsp;Lafontaine to act as <i>amicus curiae </i>to ensure that all issues favouring the appellant’s
    position were placed before the court.  On his appeal to this court, the appellant similarly refused to retain
    counsel and the court appointed Mr. Lafontaine as <i>amicus</i>.  Mr.&nbsp;Lafontaine
    carried out those responsibilities at trial and before this court with
    admirable tenacity and skill in the face of ill-considered and abusive comments
    from the appellant.  I reiterate what the
    Associate Chief Justice said at the conclusion of the oral argument:  this court is indebted to Mr.&nbsp;Lafontaine

    an adjournment to retain counsel.  From
    the time he was charged, efforts have been made to convince the appellant to
    retain counsel.  It has been over six
    years since the conclusion of the trial.  The appellant placed no material before this court to demonstrate that
    he had any real intention to retain counsel or that he had taken any steps to
    do so.  The court informed the appellant
    that the appeal would proceed.  The
    appellant accepted this ruling and indicated that he would be ready to proceed
    with his submissions the following day.  We acceded to his request as to the timing of his submissions.  Accordingly, we heard submissions of <i>amicus</i> and the Crown in reply to those
    submissions and then adjourned the appeal to the following day.  The following day, Mr. Lafontaine completed
    his reply submissions.  The appellant was
    then called upon to make his submissions.  He declined, stating that he would not participate in an “unlawful
    assembly”.</p>

    customers to the back of the café where they began to rob them.  In the course of the robbery, one of the men
    shot and killed Georgina Leimonis, a white woman.  The initial entrance of the four men and the

    trial.  In order to understand this
    submission it will be necessary to set out in detail the procedure followed by
    the trial judge.  However, that process
    was a result of the particular circumstances and context of this unique
    case.  I therefore intend to begin with a
    very brief explanation of that context.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            <i>The Context</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have said that race became an important feature of
    this case.  The killing of an innocent
    bystander to a brutal robbery shocked the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto
    community.  Media coverage of the murder
    was intense and some of it, unfortunately, came to focus on the colour of the
    perpetrators and the victim.  The accused
    and some of their counsel alleged that the justice system was racist and that
    they could not get a fair trial.  The
    wider
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto
    community became engaged in this discussion.  In their factum, Crown counsel describe the context in which this trial
    took place:  “Some of the media coverage
    was inflammatory and racist and had the effect of encouraging an emergent
    ‘anti-black’ and ‘anti-immigration’ sentiment in the City of Toronto.  Voices amongst minority members of the
    community, meanwhile, expressed worry about the effect of racism on the
    fairness of these particular criminal proceedings.”  The trial judge, in his ruling dismissing the
    application by the accused for various forms of <i>Charter</i> relief and a stay of proceedings for abuse of process,
    described some of the media coverage:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The topics
    covered by the media include the events at the restaurant, the death of Ms.
    Leimonis and its tragic effect on her immediate relatives, the videotape of the
    incident, the investigation by the police, the arrest of the accused, the bail
    hearings and reviews, the delays in the prosecution, the immigration policies
    of Canada and the related parliamentary debates, the value of stricter gun
    control, the increase in violent crime in Toronto, the fund-raising for the
    related civil litigation, the other charges against the accused, the
    involvement of immigrants from Jamaica in criminal activity, the existence of
    racism in Canada, the value of harsher sentences for violent crimes, the
    interference with the investigation by the press, the comments by the Minister
    of Justice, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Mayor of
    Toronto, the letters to the editors, the editorial comments of the newspapers,
    the vigil on the anniversary of the death of Ms. Leimonis, the funding of the
    police, the selection of the jury and the stay of proceedings against Emile
    Mark Jones.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his ruling permitting a relatively wide challenge
    for cause, the trial judge described the effect of the media coverage on the
    perceived fairness of the system:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Suffice it to
    say by way of overview that race played a part in the media coverage and it
    was, at times, inflammatory in its tone. Photographs reinforced the
    inter-racial nature of the crime and commentaries described
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto as a city losing its innocence. The
    incident was described as “… urban terrorism …”. This coverage affected the
    perception by the public of this case and, in particular, the perception of it
    by white people who do not know any black people and the perception of the
    police as saviours in a decaying society. It also tended to reinforce in
    minority groups the feelings of unfair treatment they experience in this society.
    It leads some to believe there is a correlation between race and crime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The impact of this context is fully revealed in the
    trial judge’s many rulings.  I do not
    need to set out all the allegations made by the defence or the evidence they
    called to support these allegations.  Suffice to say that, by the time it came to select a jury the trial
    judge was justifiably concerned about whether the accused and the people of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto could have
    confidence in the criminal justice system’s response to this prosecution and,
    accordingly, confidence in any verdict delivered by a jury in those
    circumstances.  That concern, in the end,
    was grounded in the colour of skin of the accused and the victim.  The trial judge believed that he had to
    address that issue and that it was important to do so in the jury selection
    process.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>The Jury Selection Method </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Twelve hundred people were summoned for this
    trial.  In the end, approximately one
    thousand persons responded to the summons.  The potential jurors were summoned in four groups to attend on different
    days.  The exact fashion in which the one
    thousand people were divided into the four groups is unknown, but it is not
    suggested that anything turns on this aspect of the case.  I assume the selection was made randomly by a
    court official.  The names of the
    approximately two hundred and fifty persons who attended on any given day were
    placed in a drum.  The court registrar
    then randomly drew the names from a drum in groups of twenty-five.  Each group of twenty-five was assigned a date
    and time to return to the court to complete the jury selection process.  The assignment of date and time was done
    randomly by the trial judge except in one respect.  Groups of twenty-five with black people or
    people from other identifiable groups were assigned a date more likely to be
    reached before the jury was selected. Throughout these reasons I will refer to
    this process as the “come-forward” process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is this last feature of the come-forward process
    that <i>amicus</i> submits fundamentally
    undermined the validity of the jury composition.  The trial judge gave these reasons for his
    decision:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The return dates
    could be randomly selected by drawing them from a box. Alternatively, I, as the
    trial judge, could randomly pick a return date subject to ensuring those groups
    of twenty-five with black people on them are assigned a return date that is
    likely to be reached before the twelve jurors are selected. Similar efforts
    could be made to facilitate the participation of all other identifiable groups
    in the process. This latter method is not a fully random one but it does tend
    to foster the value of representativeness in the process of selecting the jury
    by ensuring the black people on the panel a reasonable chance of being selected
    as a juror. This is not to give black people an undue preference in the
    selection of the jury. It merely ensures they and all other identifiable groups
    will be considered by the triers and counsel as prospective jurors. In the
    unique circumstances of this case, this is an appropriate step by the court
    because it will tend to increase the public confidence in the administration of
    justice. Black people on the jury panel and all other identifiable groups will
    have a reasonable chance of being selected as jurors. In my opinion, s. 631 of
    the Code does not contemplate the selection of return dates. Accordingly, the
    discretion of the trial judge should be exercised to ensure the essential
    fairness of the process and to give recognition to the values of the Charter
    impacting upon jury selection. I will randomly select the return days for each
    group of twenty-five jurors subject to ensuring all identifiable groups,
    including those with black people in them, will be assigned a date likely to be
    reached before the jury of twelve is selected.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel has attempted to analyze the impact of
    the trial judge’s decision on the randomness of the jury pool.  There are gaps in the available information
    but the following demonstrates what some of the information shows.  The first group to return for the selection
    process was labelled DD.  In this group
    of twenty-five, only four persons identified themselves as something other than
    “white”.  Group Y was the second group.  Six people identified themselves as something
    other than white.  The last complete group
    to attend for the selection process was group R.  Three persons identified themselves as
    something other than white.  Group L was
    the second last complete group to attend.  Five persons identified themselves as something other than white.  Group C returned to the court roughly in the
    middle of the selection process.  Ten
    persons identified themselves as something other than white.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Statistics
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    information for 2001 indicates that in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto
    56.5 per cent of people identified as white, 7.9 per cent as black and 35.6 per
    cent as “other”.  Approximately half of
    the one thousand person jury pool took part in the come-forward process.  Of that group, 67.4 per cent identified as
    white, 5.9 per cent as black and 26.7 per cent as “other”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is difficult to draw any firm conclusions from the
    materials put together by the Crown.  However, one thing is clear.  The
    trial judge’s intervention into the random selection process had virtually no
    real impact on the make-up of the come-forward group when compared to the
    racial make-up of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  The come-forward group was still
    overwhelmingly populated by white persons.  The trial judge’s intervention did no more than provide some assurance
    that the accused would have access to some non-whites.  Because there is no material relating to the
    groups that never returned to court, it is impossible to otherwise tell what
    impact the trial judge’s decision had on the make-up of the come-forward
    group.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, although the trial judge canvassed the
    proposed come-forward process with the parties, only counsel for one accused
    and the Crown expressed reservations on jurisdictional grounds.  The trial judge gave the accused a veto over
    his suggested process.  No counsel
    clearly objected to the process on the basis of unfairness or prejudice to
    their ability to exercise their peremptory challenges.  The appellant, who was otherwise very vocal
    about most aspects of the trial, raised no objection to the process.  I do not say that the parties consented to
    the process, but the lack of objection is telling when the submission is now
    made that the process was unfair.  I now
    turn to that submission.</p>

    special arrangements for jury selection.  First, because of the intense pre-trial
    publicity, all potential jurors would be challenged for cause.  It was reasonable to believe that a number of
    jurors would be eliminated because of the impact of the publicity on their
    ability to judge the case impartially.  Second, the three accused and the Crown had amongst them a total of
    eighty-eight peremptory challenges.  Finally, it was expected that the trial would be a very long one and
    that many potential jurors would be excused on hardship grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, a large pool of jurors would be needed, far
    beyond what a literal interpretation of s. 631 could accommodate.  That section contemplates a process whereby
    out of an array of, perhaps, two hundred persons, the names of twenty to thirty
    persons are pulled from the drum on a random basis.  If the first group of persons is insufficient
    to complete the jury, the court resorts to s. 631(5) and the procedure is
    repeated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, that process was not feasible.  It was not possible to keep one thousand
    people waiting.  It was not possible to
    assemble one thousand people every time a pool of twenty or thirty jurors had
    been exhausted.  To apply s. 631 would
    have resulted in intolerable inconvenience to potential jurors.  It would have been unfair to the jurors.  As Wein J. said in <i>R. v. VandenElsen</i> (2005), 29 C.R. (6th) 325 (Ont. S.C.J.) at para.
    15:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A system, which
    requires hundreds of persons to wait unnecessarily, perhaps in uncomfortable
    surroundings, does not support the goals of enhancing the administration of
    justice. In participating in the selection process, a prospective juror forms
    direct impressions concerning the court system. The impression left should be
    that the jury service process is a worthwhile participation in democracy. An
    unnecessarily inefficient system will not enhance those goals. [Footnote
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since it was not possible to proceed in accordance with
    s. 631 without causing intolerable inconvenience to potential jurors, the trial
    judge had an inherent jurisdiction to adopt a process that was consistent with
    the spirit of s. 631.  In my view, the
    process adopted by the trial judge in this case (dividing the array into groups
    of twenty-five and having these groups attend on successive days for the
    selection procedures) was a reasonable one.  It was a process that he was entitled to adopt and he did not require
    the consent of the parties to proceed in this manner.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My only concern with the process adopted by the trial
    judge is his decision to determine the order in which the groups of twenty-five
    would return by the presence of persons of colour in the group.  This process did not give the Crown any
    unfair advantage but, arguably, it violated s. 631(4).  I also do not consider it to be an advisable
    procedure and it should not be used in the future.  There are an almost infinite number of
    characteristics that one might consider should be represented in the petit
    jury: age, occupation, wealth, residency, country of origin, colour, sex,
    sexual orientation, marital status, ability, disability and so on.  It would be impossible to ensure this degree
    of representation in any particular jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To determine whether this part of the process was
    reversible error it is necessary to situate the argument in the larger context
    of the role of the jury.  In <i>R. v. Sherratt</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d)
    193 at 203, the Supreme Court of Canada described the rationale for the current
    criminal jury system:  “The jury, through
    its collective decision making, is an excellent fact-finder; due to its
    representative character, it acts as the conscience of the community; the jury
    can act as the final bulwark against oppressive laws or their enforcement; it
    provides a means whereby the public increases its knowledge of the criminal
    justice system and it increases, through the involvement of the public,
    societal trust in the system as a whole.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two characteristics of impartiality and
    representativeness contribute to the aims described in <i>Sherratt</i>.  In fact, in <i>Sherratt</i> at p. 204, the court suggested
    that “without the two characteristics of impartiality and representativeness, a
    jury would be unable to perform properly many of the functions that make its
    existence desirable in the first place”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and the provincial jury legislation attempt, within reason, to foster
    these two characteristics.  One way in
    which these two characteristics are encouraged is through random procedures at
    each stage of the selection process: from the time when the sheriff randomly
    selects the persons to be members of the array to the random selection of
    jurors’ names from the drum.  However,
    randomness is not a goal in and of itself.  It is a means by which impartiality and representativeness are
    optimized.  The attack on the procedure
    adopted by the trial judge in this case, based solely on the interference with
    absolute randomness, fails to take into account that the procedures adopted by
    the trial judge ensured the necessary impartiality and representativeness.  To repeat: the potential jurors were randomly
    selected from the list of all eligible jurors in Toronto, the names of all
    potential jurors were randomly selected from the drum and potential jurors were
    randomly assigned to groups of twenty-five.  These procedures were enough to ensure randomness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his carefully crafted argument, <i>amicus</i> suggests that the trial judge undermined impartiality and
    representativeness.  There is no
    foundation for this submission.  The
    trial judge’s decision as to the order in which these randomly selected groups
    of twenty-five returned to the courtroom did not and could not undermine the
    inherent random nature of the jury.  All
    that the trial judge did was attempt to foster one element of
    representativeness, racial diversity, that he felt needed emphasis in this
    case.  In his view, that element required
    emphasis to promote the goals of the jury serving as the conscience of the
    community and societal trust in the system as a whole.  This jury was honestly and fairly chosen; its
    integrity was not compromised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Amicus</i> also
    submits that by focusing on colour to determine the order in which the groups
    came forward, the trial judge ignored other characteristics that the accused
    might believe were better suited to the issues in this case.  He submits that the accused might have
    preferred to focus on other factors.  This is pure speculation and no basis for interfering with the verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, <i>amicus</i> places particular emphasis on this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Rowbotham</i> (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1.  That case was decided under the former
    provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  In short, the trial judge in <i>Rowbotham </i>failed
    to follow mandatory provisions of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> concerning the order in which jurors stood aside by the Crown were
    recalled.  The result of the trial
    judge’s decision was that the jury was continuously expanded without the
    stand-asides being reached.  This court
    was particularly concerned that the trial judge may have been motivated by an
    attempt to redress the balance between Crown and defence (see p. 37).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  In doing so, the trial judge deprived the
    accused of a statutory right.  That is
    not what occurred here.  Even if the
    process violated s. 631(4), the accused were not prejudiced in any way.  The departure from the strict requirements of
    s. 631, which did not prejudice the accused nor deprive them of any benefit,
    does not undermine the validity of the trial.  This is confirmed by s.&nbsp;643(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which provides that: “Failure to comply with the
    directions of … section 631 … does not affect the validity of the proceeding.”</p>

    admissible if it accurately and fairly presented the information it purported
    to convey.  He could easily reach the
    conclusion that it did by viewing the videotape against the backdrop of the
    expert and other evidence.  He explained
    why he reached his conclusion based on the expert and other evidence.  He also explained why he discounted the
    opinions of the defence expert.  I expect
    that the trial judge’s reference to the appearances of the accused in the
    courtroom was nothing more than a way of checking the decision he made based on
    the other evidence.  Had he been the
    trier of fact, the trial judge would have been required to compare the
    appearance of the accused in court with the appearances of the perpetrators on
    the videotape.  Similarly, at the stage
    of threshold reliability, the trial judge was entitled to make the same
    comparison.  He did not begin his
    analysis from the impermissible starting point that the accused must be the
    perpetrators depicted in the videotape.</p>

line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial judge, in effect, was invited by
    counsel for Francis to engage in this exercise.  Counsel for Francis, who led this part of the defence case, gave one of
    his experts photographs of Francis for the purpose of comparing them with the
    images of the perpetrator alleged to be Francis.  As Crown counsel points out, defence counsel
    implicitly acknowledged that taking the appearance of the accused into account
    was a relevant consideration in assessing the reliability of the videotape.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Admissibility

line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown proposed to call a large number of witnesses
    who knew the accused, including the appellant, and were able to recognize them
    from the videotape.  After hearing the
    evidence of all these witnesses, the trial judge permitted the Crown to call
    only some of them.  He also imposed
    limits on Crown counsel concerning the admission of evidence of the circumstances
    under which the witnesses came into contact with the appellant.  He did this to limit the prejudicial effect
    of the evidence since some of the witnesses knew the appellant because of his
    involvement in criminal or discreditable conduct.  Crown counsel adhered to these
    directions.  In his cross-examination of
    some of the witnesses, the appellant elicited some of his own discreditable
    conduct, despite being warned by the trial judge against doing so.</p>

    that the recognition witnesses should not have been called because they
    provided inadmissible non-expert opinion evidence and the witnesses could not

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This last issue can be dealt with in short order.  As I have said, Crown counsel was scrupulous
    in adhering to the trial judge’s directions.  It was the appellant, conducting his own defence, who elicited most of
    the prejudicial information.  The trial
    judge assisted the appellant to ensure that he understood the consequences of
    some of the questions he asked and, on occasion, the appellant would move on to
    another area.  This was not a case where
    the prejudicial evidence was necessary to understand the frailties of the
    testimony of the Crown witnesses.  If
    that had been the case, the balance might have shifted in favour of excluding
    the evidence.  Finally, the trial judge
    gave the jury directions as to the limited use they could make of the evidence
    of discreditable and criminal conduct.</p>

    satisfied that the trial judge was correct to admit the evidence.  In <i>R.
    v. Leaney</i> (1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 303, the Supreme Court of Canada
    held that this type of non-expert opinion evidence is admissible provided that
    the witness has a prior acquaintance with the accused and is thus in a better
    position than the trier of fact to identify the perpetrator.  All the witnesses whose testimony was
    admitted by the trial judge fell into this category.  For example, one witness was the appellant’s
    aunt and had known him for years.  Another witness had been his partner for some time.  The recognition evidence was also important
    because the appellant had changed his appearance since the robbery, five years
    earlier, and the recognition witnesses were familiar with the appellant’s
    appearance at times close to the robbery.  The various witnesses explained why they recognized the appellant as the
    man in the videotape.  The jury was thus
    in a position to evaluate the probative value of their evidence.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
    Charge to the Jury on Identification </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    two concerns with the charge to the jury on the identification issue.  First, he submits that the trial judge erred
    in inviting the jurors to compare the image of the perpetrator alleged to be
    the appellant with the appearance of the appellant in the courtroom by
    superimposing their mental image of the appellant on the image in the
    videotape. <i>Amicus </i>submits that this part of the charge undermined the
    presumption of innocence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I admit to some doubt as to the purpose, feasibility or
    value of this exercise.  However, I
    cannot see that it had any prejudicial impact on the appellant.  In one way or another, the jury would have to
    compare the images.  The trial judge told
    the jury to be “extremely cautious in making this comparison”.  He went on to give the jury very helpful
    instructions for using the videotape evidence.  Looking at the directions as a whole, I am satisfied that this
    particular part of the charge did not have the effect of undermining the
    presumption of innocence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second concern that <i>amicus </i>raises concerns
    the use of the recognition witness evidence.  He submits that the trial judge should have told the jury that even
    people who have known someone for a very long time can make mistakes in
    recognition.  I doubt that any such
    direction was called for in this case.  This was not a case where the recognition witnesses only had a fleeting
    opportunity to observe the person.  The
    recognition witnesses had repeated opportunities to view the videotape and
    adequate time to make the identification.  The trial judge gave a very full direction about the frailties of
    identification evidence.  He told the
    jury that mistakes have been made by identification witnesses and that
    convincing and honest witnesses can be mistaken.  Since there was no eyewitness evidence (none
    of the people in the restaurant purported to identify the perpetrators), the
    jury would understand that these directions applied to the recognition
    witnesses.  In my view, the charge to the
    jury was entirely adequate.</p>

    accidental.  The appellant objected to
    the witnesses being called.  The trial
    judge held that the appellant’s position was not so unreasonable that he should
    interfere with his conduct of his defence.  He refused to call the witnesses.  The trial judge’s decision was correct.  The appellant was entitled to conduct his own defence.  That included deciding whether to testify or
    call witnesses.  The appellant’s decision
    not to call these witnesses and not to have the trial judge call them was
    reasonable.  The value of their evidence
    as to the accidental discharge was questionable.  Their police statements were inconsistent
    with all the other evidence in the case and may have been a product, in part,
    of the fact that English was not their first language and they were speaking
    with the assistance of interpreters.  Further, these witnesses would also have testified that it was the
    tallest perpetrator who shot the victim.  The appellant was the tallest of the three accused.  Thus, the proposed evidence had little
    probative value and the potential for significant prejudicial effect.</p>
