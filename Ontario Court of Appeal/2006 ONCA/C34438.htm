    </span> Following a five and one-half month trial before Then J. and a jury, 
    the appellant was convicted of first degree murder.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He appeals his conviction on the grounds that 
    the trial judge erred in rulings made during the course of the trial and alleged 
    errors in his charge to the jury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Following 
    oral argument, we dismissed the appeal with reasons to follow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>These are our reasons.<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The theory of the Crown was that the appellant anally raped and killed 
    Amin Sajadin (&#8220;Amin&#8221;), the sixteen-year-old son of his estranged lover, Akram 
    Sajadin (&#8220;Akram&#8221;), in an act of revenge, out of anger and in retaliation for 
    having been humiliated and spurned by her a few days earlier. In addition 
    to having been raped, Amin had been struck over the head multiple times and 
    repeatedly fatally stabbed in the chest. Over a period of a few days, the 
    appellant, with experience as a butcher, de-fleshed and dismembered the body, 
    and secreted body parts in various places to cover up his crime.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>During this time, when Akram, distraught, called 
    the appellant looking for Amin, he pretended to comfort her and to help her 
    to look for her son.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The smell of 
    decaying flesh in the apartment led the appellant&#8217;s roommates to parts of 
    the body and they called the police. The Crown presented circumstantial evidence 
    against the appellant, which included motive, exclusive opportunity and a 
    cogent body of post-offence conduct pointing to the appellant as the killer.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The theory of the defence was that the appellant had a close but platonic 
    relationship with Amin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The appellant 
    claimed that he was helping Akram to sell opium brought into the country by 
    her husband.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Persons alleged by the 
    appellant to be connected with the Zarifian family stole the opium from him 
    and threatened him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Later, two enforcers acting for the thieves complained to him about 
    the quality of the drugs, as well as the sale of opium in their territory 
    and slashed his hand with a knife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They 
    were also upset because Akram had threatened to go to the police.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the date of the murder, these two enforcers 
    came to his apartment with Amin, demanding more opium.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They raped Amin, and forced the appellant to 
    do the same thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He claimed that 
    he escaped from his apartment in order to go and protect Akram, as he feared 
    that the assailants would go to her for opium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>When he returned to his apartment, he found Amin lying dead in the 
    bathtub.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Afraid that he would be blamed 
    for the murder, the appellant decided to dispose of the body and cleaned up 
    his apartment to remove evidence of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Crown counsel attacked the appellant&#8217;s story by pointing out a number 
    of inconsistencies, contradictions, and gaps in logic, common sense and human 
    experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Only the appellant&#8217;s semen 
    was found in the body of the victim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> Although there was some evidence that the appellant and Akram had 
    involvement with opium, there was no evidence to indicate any connection between 
    the drug-related activities and the murder, save for the appellant&#8217;s account 
    of the events. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> The appellant told the police that he had buried the head and arms 
    of the victim in a nearby ravine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The 
    Crown wanted to lead forensic evidence relating to the head because the blunt 
    force injuries on the scalp of the victim were consistent with a hammer in 
    the possession of the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Following 
    a <i>voir dire</i>, the trial judge ruled that certain statements made by 
    the appellant were inadmissible on <i>Charter</i> grounds.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These included the appellant&#8217;s agreement to 
    disclose the location where he had buried the head and arms of the victim.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The trial judge held that this evidence, which 
    resulted from the conscription of the appellant against himself, would inevitably 
    taint the fairness of the trial as he was not satisfied that these body parts 
    would have been discovered without the appellant&#8217;s assistance.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The discovery of the severed head and arms 
    was therefore inadmissible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The trial 
    judge issued clear directions to counsel that neither the discovery of the 
    head nor its condition was to be used to advance the case for either side.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> On two occasions during the cross-examination of Akram, defence counsel 
    made references to the appellant&#8217;s statements that had earlier been excluded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>Crown counsel objected to the references to the excluded statements 
    and put the defence counsel on notice that, if this practice continued, he 
    would seek a reconsideration of the ruling. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> When the forensic pathologist took the stand, counsel had to be careful 
    on how to introduce his evidence without referring to the head of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The doctor&#8217;s report was edited for presentation to the jury and the 
    doctor was instructed not to refer to the head or its relevance to the determination 
    of the gender of the body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>The proceedings 
    seemed to proceed satisfactorily in accordance with the ruling until defence 
    counsel suggested to the doctor that he had taken oral swabs.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The doctor alertly understood the difficulty with the question and 
    asked directions from the trial judge, who directed defence counsel to continue 
    without an answer to the question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> This was the first clear reference to the victim&#8217;s head.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Given the mention of the oral swabs and the 
    leading nature of the question, it could not have escaped the jury that the 
    head had been located and been subject to forensic examination.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Crown raised &#8220;vociferous&#8221; objection and 
    submitted that it had been so seriously prejudiced that a mistrial might be 
    required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span> According to the Crown, the defence question clearly indicated that 
    the head had been examined by the pathologist and it created a real danger 
    that the jury would surmise that the Crown had concealed material evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The transgression was all the more serious because the appellant was 
    expected to testify that Amin was struck over the head by two intruders with 
    hammer-like weapons depicted in a diagram prepared by the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
    </span>The jury would wonder why the Crown had not tested the head or, alternatively, 
    assume from the absence of evidence that the Crown could not rebut the appellant&#8217;s 
    assertion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In fact, the Crown had 
    wanted to lead the forensic evidence to the effect that the pattern of injuries 
    was consistent with the head of a hammer found in the appellant&#8217;s apartment 
    but had been prevented from doing so by the trial judge&#8217;s ruling.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The question concerning oral swabs suggested 
    that the defence wanted material evidence placed before the jury and the Crown 
    did not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Crown submitted that 
    this sort of prejudice could not be cured through judicial instruction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span

    the victim&#8217;s family from holding a proper burial.<span

    stated that when he returned to his apartment he saw the hammer in his apartment

    inadequate and did not go far enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    the jury to assess the explanation given by the appellant.<span

style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In his view, the pursuit of the proposed line 
    of cross-examination would not further the resolution of the issues in the 
    case but may serve to distract and confuse the jury while needlessly prolonging 
    the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Nonetheless, the trial 
    judge was prepared to allow defence counsel to cross-examine Akram to the 
    effect that she had concocted the threats because it bore on her credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
