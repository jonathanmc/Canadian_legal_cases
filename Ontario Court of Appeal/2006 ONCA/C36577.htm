    after noon on January 11, 1999, four balaclava-clad men entered the Toronto-Dominion
    Bank branch located at 230 Sandalwood Drive, Brampton, Ontario. At least
    three of the four were armed, one with a shotgun and the others with handguns.
    The employees and customers of the bank were ordered to lie down on the floor.
    Three of the bank employees, Manjinder Sihota, Connie Lowry and Joanne Wylie,
    were forced into the vault by one of the robbers, where they were ordered
    to open the compartments. All three were, to varying degrees, manhandled
    and physically brutalized by the robbers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    Kidd’s desk was located near the vault entrance. When the robbery began,
    she was seated at her desk with a customer, Ian Kosher, who was an off-duty
    police officer. She and Kosher lay on the floor on opposite sides of her
    desk with Mrs. Kidd on the side closest to the vault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were two cameras in the bank and the robbery was recorded on video. The range
    of the cameras, however, did not reach the interior of the employees’ offices
    and the areas inside and just outside of the vault. Accordingly, the shooting
    of Mrs. Kidd and the violence directed against the bank personnel in the
    vault were not recorded on video.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    robber with the shotgun was inside the vault with Wylie and Lowry, who were
    trying to open one of the compartments. Sihota was also inside the vault
    near its entrance, and a second robber was standing beside her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third robber stood close to Mrs. Kidd and Mr. Kosher. Kosher observed that
    this robber’s handgun was about five and one-half inches long with a one
    and one-half inch barrel. He saw a brass casing in the chamber and observed
    that the gun was cocked. It appeared to him that the gun had live ammunition
    and was ready to be fired.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    Wylie and Lowry succeeded in unlocking the compartment, they heard a popping
    noise outside the vault, which Lowry recognized as a gunshot. Several witnesses
    outside the vault also heard this noise, but no one saw the shot being fired
    and it took place out of the field of view of the security cameras. It was
    subsequently determined that the shot was fired from a handgun. Only one
    of the robbers in the vault area was so armed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the shot was fired, and while Lowry was in the vault making efforts to spin
    her combinations to open the compartment, she testified that the robber who
    stood by Mrs. Kidd’s desk yelled inside to them: “they don’t think we mean
    business”; and “you’d better hurry up or your friend out here is going to
    get it.”  Lowry remembers this “distinctly” and she remembered she was “spinning
    really fast”. About 10 or 15 seconds after that threat, when she got to the
    last number of the combination, she “distinctly remembers” hearing a “pop” sound.
    She knew it was from a gun. Shortly after the shot, Lowry heard the same
    voice (as she had previously heard), again from outside of the vault yelling
    into them: “tell them I’ve just shot their friend out here.”  The robber
    inside the vault then “repeated or reinforced the shooter’s message” and
    said: “we’ve just shot your friend out there and you’re all next if you don’t
    hurry up.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of Wylie, Sihota nor Kosher heard any threats uttered before the gunshot.
    All three heard the threat uttered after Mrs. Kidd was shot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lowry
    and Wylie succeeded in opening the compartment shortly after hearing the
    shot but it was empty. Soon after, another teller (Sandy Chau) entered the
    vault and opened a safe deposit box holding about $20,000 cash. The robber
    with the shotgun took this money and left the vault. All four robbers then
    left the bank.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the immediate efforts of those in the bank after the robbers left, Mrs. Kidd
    had no vital signs <i>en route</i> to the hospital and was pronounced dead
    shortly after her arrival. The cause of her death was exsanguination secondary
    to a gunshot wound. On the medical evidence, Mrs. Kidd would have died within
    three to five minutes of being shot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 15<sup>th</sup>, four days after the robbery, the police found the
    stolen minivan used in the robbery in the underground parking garage of the
    apartment building where Jacqueline Thompson lived. The appellant was Thompson’s
    husband’s former employee, and she had known him for a few years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the day of the robbery, the appellant came to Thompson’s apartment with his
    cousin, Dwayne Lawes, and two other men she did not know. While they were
    in her apartment, she overheard one of the men say: “the fucking lady didn’t
    want to open the safe”. At the beginning of her testimony at trial, Thompson
    attributed this statement to the appellant, but by the end of her cross-examination,
    she was no longer sure who said this. She asked the appellant what the comment
    was about, and he told her that: they were in Brampton; they robbed a bank;
    he shot a lady accidentally, and he hoped she did not die. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the men arrived at Thompson’s apartment, they had two gym bags with them – one
    small, one large. Thompson’s young son opened the small bag and, when he
    did, she could see that there was “crumpled up” money in it. She called two
    taxis for the four men and they left. Before leaving, the appellant asked
    Thompson if he could leave the larger bag with her and said that he would
    come back for it. She later looked in the bag and saw three or four jackets,
    masks and a “shot – tall gun” that was about three feet long. She got scared
    and took the bag to the appellant’s grandmother. Neither the bag nor its
    contents were ever recovered by the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the Crown introduced a statement made by the appellant to Rhyll Carty,
    a man known to some in the Toronto Jamaican community as “Brother Tony” – a
    self-styled “spiritualist” and “psychic counsellor”. Carty ran a shop on
    Davenport Road in Toronto; the sign outside his shop read
    “O’Shanti’s Herbal Store – Religious Articles – Candles – Herbs”. The sign
    also advertised counselling services. Some in the community, including Thompson,
    considered Carty to be a “very religious man” with mystical powers. In the
    past, for example, she had consulted him about marital and family problems
    and explained that she “went to see him the same way other people would go
    see a priest”. Carty’s main business was performing “psychic” or “spiritual” readings
    for clients from the Caribbean community. He invented mystical rituals, based
    on things he had read about. While Carty himself denied practising Obeah<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> and claimed minimal knowledge of Jamaican
    supernatural beliefs and traditions, the appellant’s aunt Sonia Gallimore,
    who was a regular client, testified it was understood within the Jamaican
    community that Carty was an Obeah practitioner. Carty conceded that he knew
    he had this reputation and did nothing to discourage it. He conceded he had
    no genuine spiritual powers and that he could be described as a “con man
    and a charlatan” because he misled his clients into believing otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    few days after the appellant and his three confederates had visited Thompson
    (right after the robbery), she sought advice from Carty. She told him about
    the visit to her apartment shortly after the crime and that she had overheard
    the appellant tell one of the men, “the fucking woman didn’t want to open
    the safe”. She also relayed that the appellant told her that the four of
    them had committed a robbery and that he had accidentally shot a woman. She
    told him that the men had left a bag at her apartment, which she discovered
    contained a shotgun with a wooden handle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
    six weeks before the robbery, the appellant and Lawes had been introduced
    to Carty by their aunt, Sonia Gallimore. Lawes had requested Carty’s “help … doing
    certain illegal activities” and told Carty that they could make him “a lot
    of money.”  They explained to Carty that they robbed banks and wanted Carty’s
    protection against apprehension.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    couple of weeks later, the appellant and Lawes again met with Carty at his
    shop on a Saturday. They told Carty then that they were going to be robbing
    a bank on the following Tuesday or Wednesday. At this meeting, they described
    their operation as “bursting in, yelling, shouting, jump over the counter,
    kind of creating a kind of fear, so to speak, and they do what they do”.
    Carty never saw any news of a robbery in that following week, and he next
    encountered the appellant and Lawes on the night of January 10, 1999, at
    Gallimore’s apartment. The two took Carty aside and told him they were planning
    to rob a bank in Brampton the next morning and needed some protection. Carty
    responded by telling them not to do anything “crazy or stupid” and that if
    anyone was hurt, he would turn them in to the police. It was the very next
    day that the robbery and murder of Mrs. Kidd took place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Carty
    heard about the robbery between 5 and 6 p.m. on the day of the robbery on
    his car radio as he drove down Highway 10. He said he was shocked but “immediately
    my mind rushes to what I was told the night before”
    and he made the link between the robbery and what the appellant and Lawes
    had said.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Carty
    testified that he did not immediately go to the police, but took some time
    to think the situation through. He went to the police on the evening following
    the robbery and told police what he knew.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    Carty went to the Peel police, he agreed to co-operate with the police and
    assist them in their investigation. As of January 13, 1999, Carty was considered
    to be acting as a police agent. He was paid by the police and, in addition,
    made a claim for the $200,000 reward money offered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
    the police obtained an authorization to intercept certain communications.
    Carty consented to having his phone tapped and to have video- and audio-recording
    equipment installed in his shop. The police wanted him to set up a meeting
    with the perpetrators, and he agreed to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 16, 1999, at 4:19 p.m., the appellant, in response to an earlier
    call from Carty, contacted Carty and asked if it was safe for him to leave
    the country. Carty insisted the appellant come and meet him at the store
    later that evening. The appellant agreed to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    this conversation, recorded by police, it was learned that Lawes (or “Champ” as
    he was known), and one of the other robbers had already left the city. Only
    the appellant and Dain Campbell remained, and both were to meet Carty at
    his shop at 6:30 p.m. Carty asked the appellant during this conversation
    if Campbell “[believed] in the things I do” and was assured by the appellant
    that he did. Both were instructed to place an egg in a black sock and knot
    the sock twice and bring the socks with them to the meeting. The appellant
    was instructed not to wear anything black.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Carty
    met privately with each, first with the appellant and thereafter with Campbell.
    It is important to note that the first contact between Carty and the appellant
    after the robbery was initiated by Carty and not the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    explained to both that in order for him to help them, they would each have
    to relate to him a detailed account of the robbery events. In doing so, the
    appellant admitted the robbery, gave the names of the other three participants
    and said that he had accidentally shot Nancy Kidd.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Carty
    began his interview with the appellant by telling him that he was willing
    to help him because the appellant looked like his son. He said he could help
    the appellant but it was going to cost him because he (Carty) had “to pay
    a few people still”. Carty took some money from the appellant and told him
    that he could pay the rest later. When the appellant told Carty that Champ
    had three thousand dollars for him, Carty responded that he wanted his money
    because he had earned it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant told Carty they had used a shotgun and a handgun. He stated: “I
    just climbed in there. I saw this woman. So I grabbed her … I cocked it and
    the bullet flew out. I didn’t even know that the safety was off at the time.
    Then boom the bullet in her in the chest. I got frightened, then boom it
    was the woman that got killed, I grabbed her and … the gun went boom boom
    and the woman got killed.”  He told Carty he planned to go to Maryland where
    he had an aunt living. At the conclusion of the interview Carty reminded
    the appellant that his was not a free business and that he appellant had
    to pay him money along the way. Some money was placed on the table by the
    appellant and Carty told him to put a candle on top of it.</p>

    factum, these included:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(a) A Roman Catholic Priest would not offer a citizen protection against arrest
    for past crimes – the notion of sanctuary was struck down in the middle ages.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(b) Similarly, a priest would not offer protection for future crimes. As put
    by Father Lynch: “You can never counsel someone to do evil”. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(c) It would fall outside of the usual mandate of a religious priest to counsel
    or assist a person seeking to flee the jurisdiction after the commission
    of a crime.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(d) “It goes without saying” that a priest could not rightly or knowingly take
    possession of the proceeds of crime.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(e) A Catholic priest is not allowed to charge a fee for sacrament. This practice,
    known as “simony” has been against church law since approximately 1215.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(f) There were few if any signs of “penance” on the tape. Carty did not provide
    moral guidance to the appellant or advice on how he might make his life better.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(g) The tape disclosed no articulable prayer or appeal to a deity,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(h) The encounter was lacking in the appropriate degree of solemnity that would
    ordinarily characterize a Catholic confessional.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(i) If the purpose of an encounter was to facilitate future crimes, further
    the appellant’s “career” as an armed robber, or assist with flight from the
    jurisdiction, this would generally be seen as an insincere confession.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(j) The encounter between the appellant and Carty was marked by a large secular
    component.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(k) The Church seeks to protect penitents who are truly seeking forgiveness
    for their sins. It does not wish to enshrine or protect criminals who are
    seeking to avoid the consequences of their actions.</p>

    He was willing to acknowledge only that the exchange “can suggest many things”,

    He said that many of Carty’s actions in the January 16<sup>th</sup> meeting

    resembled “not so good theatre”. And as he put it:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            I
    would say in terms of whether it was a genuine Obeah session or not from

'>And later:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>            It

    was, he said, important for clients to be truthful with the practitioner
    lest the practitioner be led “off into a direction that is not warranted,
    and therefore the effect of what he’s trying to do would not be as great
    as if he had been told the truth.” Clients generally expect the consultation

    tape which suggested the client was expressing remorse or a desire to be
    forgiven for the robbery. Indeed, he agreed with Crown counsel’s suggestion
    that the whole process (recorded on the tape) might have given the client
    more confidence to go out and rob banks which, he agreed, would outrage most
    legitimate Obeah practitioners.</p>

    did use some real Obeah practices such as the lavish use of oil and water
    in his encounters with the two men. As well, he gives them sufficient explanation
    as to how he can help them by ‘reversing’ bad influences around them. He
    even suggests that he can supply them with physical help in getting out of
    the country but his primary assistance comes about as a result of his special
    relationship with supernatural forces. Also evident is a relationship between
    client and practitioner based on trust, confidentiality and above all, faith
    in the efficacy of this belief system. All of these factors suggest to me
    that what happens on these videos, even if ‘staged’ can be interpreted as

    appellant relies on the judgment of Lamer J. (as he then was) in <i>Rothman
    v. The Queen </i>(1981), 59 C.C.C. (2d) 30 (S.C.C.). In <i>Rothman</i>, the
    accused had been arrested on a charge of possession of narcotics for the
    purpose of trafficking; and he refused to give a statement. He was then put
    in a cell at the police station. Soon after, a police officer dressed in
    old clothes was placed in the same cell. The accused told the officer that
    he thought he was a “narc” but the officer told him he was a fisherman who
    had been arrested for failing to pay a traffic ticket. The accused then engaged
    in conversation with the officer and made several inculpatory statements.
    The trial judge found that the officer was a person in authority, and he
    excluded the statements since the use of the disguise was an improper way
    of eliciting the statements. The accused was acquitted, the Crown offering
    no further evidence. The Crown’s appeal to this court was allowed and a new
    trial was ordered. The accused’s further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
    was dismissed.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Lamer wrote at pp. 73-75:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Therefore, the
    rules regarding the admissibility of statements by an accused to persons
    in authority may be enunciated in the following manner.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>1.            A
    statement made by the accused to a person in authority is inadmissible if
    tendered by the prosecution in a criminal proceeding unless the Judge is
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that nothing said or done by any person
    in authority could have induced the accused to make a statement which was
    or might be untrue;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>2.            A
    statement made by the accused to a person in authority and tendered by the
    prosecution in a criminal proceeding against him, though elicited under circumstances
    which would not render it inadmissible, shall nevertheless be excluded if
    its use in the proceedings would, as a result of what was said or done by
    any person in authority in eliciting the statement, bring the administration
    of justice into disrepute.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I would emphasize
    that under the above-mentioned second rule the Judge is not exercising a
    pure discretion to exclude, as is the case under s. 178.16(2) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, and that his finding is to be dealt with in appeal as any other
    finding, subject to the differences and limits of the Appeal Court’s jurisdiction
    as defined by s. 603 [am. 1974-75-76, c. 105, s. 13] and s. 605 [am. 1974-75-76,
    c.105, s. 15] of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I hasten to
    say also that, if the second portion of the rule is not a true discretion,
    it is even less a blanket discretion given Judges to repudiate through an
    exclusionary rule any conduct on the part of the authorities a given Judge
    might consider somewhat unfortunate, distasteful, or inappropriate. There
    first must be a clear connection between the obtaining of the statement and
    the conduct; furthermore that conduct must be so shocking as to justify the
    judicial branch of the criminal justice system in feeling that, short of
    disassociating itself from such conduct through rejection of the statement,
    its reputation and, as a result, that of the whole criminal justice system,
    would be brought into disrepute.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Judge, in
    determining whether under the circumstances the use of the statement in the
    proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, should
    consider all of the circumstances of the proceedings, the manner in which
    the statement was obtained, the degree to which there was a breach of social
    values, the seriousness of the charge, the effect the exclusion would have
    on the result of the proceedings. It must also be borne in mind that the
    investigation of crime and the detection of criminals is not a game to be
    governed by the Marquess of Queensbury rules. The authorities, in dealing
    with shrewd and often sophisticated criminals, must sometimes of necessity
    resort to tricks or other forms of deceit and should not through the rule
    be hampered in their work. What should be repressed vigorously is conduct
    on their part that shocks the community. That a police officer pretend to
    be a lock-up chaplain and hear a suspect’s confession is conduct that shocks
    the community; so is pretending to be the duty legal- aid lawyer eliciting
    in that way incriminating statements from suspects or accused; injecting
    pentothal into a diabetic suspect pretending it is his daily shot of insulin
    and using his statement in evidence would also shock the community; but generally
    speaking, pretending to be a hard drug addict to break a drug ring would
    not shock the community; nor would, as in this case, pretending to be a truck
    driver to secure the conviction of a trafficker; in fact, what would shock
    the community would be preventing the police from resorting to such a trick.</p>

    people overcome their errors by forgiving their sins has no application to

    to avoid police detection and apprehension in his chosen life’s work
    – bank robbery. This was the only purpose evident in the video recording

    be inferred that he adhered to the religious beliefs of Carty, other than
    the opinions expressed by the expert witnesses in this regard. He merely
    followed Carty’s instruction as he was directed to do. There is no evidence
    that he approached Carty in any religious sense. His only association had
    a marked secular purpose that was criminal in nature. The entire basis of
    the relationship was corrupt.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown originally commissioned a report from York University professor <i>emeritus </i>Dr.
    Frances Henry on Obeah practices. The report was, at the request of the defence,
    made an exhibit on the <i>voir dire</i>. At trial, following the trial judge’s
    decision to admit the appellant’s statement to Carty, the defence called
    Dr. Henry as its own expert in Obeah. The position of the defence was that
    the appellant believed Carty possessed supernatural powers and, therefore,
    the appellant would have been truthful with him, particularly, when telling
    Carty that his gun fired accidentally. In chief, defence counsel asked:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is
    it necessary, in terms of the belief system of Obeah, for the practitioner
    to help the petitioner, that the petitioner be truthful with the practitioner?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>A. Absolutely. The client when he or she comes to a practitioner has to
    be totally honest and open otherwise the ritual that the practitioner prescribes
    will not work. Not only will it not work but the client could, in theory,
    go back to the practitioner and say, look, whatever it is you prescribed
    for me didn’t work, and the practitioner said, well, maybe you weren’t truthful
    with me. So the chances are almost 100 percent that an individual will be
    absolutely truthful to an Obeah practitioner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, Crown counsel asked Dr. Henry whether she would “go the
    whole distance then and say that Marlon Rowe was truthful on the tape”. Her
    response was:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Well, all I
    can say is that my assessment of what I have seen on the tape is that I believe
    he is truthful, insofar as I believe any person who confesses … extremely
    negative things to an Obeah practitioner as being truthful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s complaint in relation to the trial judge’s charge to the jury
    in respect to Dr. Henry’s evidence is set out in his factum as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The trial judge
    castigated Dr. Henry repeatedly during his jury instructions for improperly
    usurping the jury’s fact-finding function, returning to this point on three
    separate occasions in his charge. Early on, during an overview of the law
    of opinion evidence, he stated:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>… Frances
    Henry had no business coming in here and stepping into your area and attempting
    to usurp your function to determine what is the truth. So I am going to go
    over it in fairness, but she had absolutely no business. She got her Ph.D.
    in 1958. She knows better and she should not have done it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Later in his
    charge, after summarizing Dr. Henry’s evidence-in-chief, the trial judge
    read a <i>verbatim</i> transcript of virtually the entire Crown cross-examination,
    interspersed with his own comments. After reading Dr. Henry’s evidence that
    she
    “put [the Appellant] in the category of a believer [in Obeah] because he
    went to see a practitioner for this particular purpose”, the trial judge
    remarked:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>Here is
    another assumption that she has made. She has just referred to it. He went
    to see a practitioner for this particular purpose. She put him in the category
    of believer because he went there for that purpose. <u>Now, where would you
    get that from? Did you hear anything about that? Another assumption. This
    woman was off the track, off the wall</u>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A short while
    later, he read the following exchange from the transcript:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q:            Don’t
    you think it would be nice to know what happened inside the bank before pronouncing
    on whether or not this confession was true?</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='
text-align:left;'>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I’m
    afraid I can’t answer that. I don’t understand the relationship between the
    two of them.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The trial judge
    then commented:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>“I don’t
    understand the relationship between the two of them.”  What a curious answer.
    Now, that is my opinion. You do not have to pay attention to it, but a very
    curious answer coming from a well-educated woman.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The trial judge
    continued reading the Crown’s cross-examination, until he came to an exchange
    where the Crown had suggested that Carty was a “criminal” because he had
    asked for money that he knew was the proceeds of crime, and Dr. Henry had
    replied:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>A.            Yes,
    [Carty] may very well be a criminal but all I was asked to do was judge whether
    or not he was practising Obeah and whether he was a practitioner.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>This prompted
    the following comment from the trial judge:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>That is
    what she was asked to do. You will ask yourself, where did she go?  Did she
    go from the North to the South Pole?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    can be no doubt that the trial judge’s forceful comments in relation to Dr.
    Henry’s evidence were ill-advised and unfortunate. Indeed, it appears from
    his charge that even the trial judge recognized that he had gone too far.
    When his charge continued after the luncheon break, the trial judge revisited
    the issue of Dr. Henry’s evidence in the following terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Ladies and gentlemen,
    before we broke for the lunch period, I had reviewed the defence evidence
    and I dealt with the evidence of Dr. Henry.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Now, it is important
    that you realize that I went over that testimony and gave you a thorough
    thumbnail outline of the role of experts in a trial for a reason. I read
    at length from the questions that were asked by Mr. Midanik and in the cross-examination,
    because you will understand that no one here, Mr. Sherriff or myself, are
    suggesting that Mr. Midanik caused this problem and Mr. Sherriff fairly,
    in his jury address or in comments about it, indicated that he was not suggesting
    that at all. So I want to make it clear to you that there is no suggestion
    by me or by Crown counsel that this was intentional. All Mr. Midanik asked
    was a fairly straightforward question: was the truth an important feature
    in Obeah? And the answer he got was developed. It was important for you to
    know that is all he asked, is it important that the petitioner be truthful
    with the practitioner? And what developed thereafter was what I dealt with,
    but there is no suggestion that Mr. Midanik did this intentionally or caused
    it. All he asked was a simple question and the best evidence of that is that,
    in his jury address—which I am about to deal with now—he simply told you
    her opinion is inadmissible. I believe he said that it is your job to determine
    if he was being truthful or if you have a doubt about it, but he told you
    that her opinion was inadmissible. He made very little use of her testimony.
    Mr. Sherriff suggested, after dealing with her testimony, that you probably
    should place very little weight, if any, on any of her evidence and he is
    entitled to do that. I am not suggesting that to you because I told you before
    you can select from testimony of a witness what you believe or what you do
    not believe or you choose to not act upon for whatever reason. That is your
    role. Mr. Midanik only made reference to her evidence when he was talking
    about the practice of Obeah and the various features of it. He was attempting
    to demonstrate for you that in fact his client, Mr. Rowe, believed that Carty
    was practising Obeah. Mr. Midanik goes further to say that he was, but even
    if he was not and only pretending to be, his client thought he was and that
    is an important part of the defence. But, I want to make it clear that it
    is up to you to use what part of the testimony of Dr. Henry appeals to you.
    That is your role, but I also should make it quite clear—and to be fair to
    Mr. Midanik and to Mr. Rowe—that there certainly was no intention of suggesting
    that this was deliberately caused or in any way should be taken into serious
    account when you are examining the defence. But you see, in the adversarial
    system when you call a witness, you call that witness for good or for bad
    and so that is one of the risks when you are counsel; but I am suggesting
    to you that you recognize that she was only called as an expert to deal within
    the field of Obeah and the various concepts that are involved and she straightened
    that out near the end, but there was quite a flurry in between. She went,
    in my opinion, far too far. I have made that clear to you. I do not want
    you to in any way take that as any adverse inference against Mr. Midanik
    or his client. That happened and it may very well be that Mr. Midanik was
    surprised by that, I do not know; but I think, in fairness, you should look
    at it and perhaps decide what weight you will put on her testimony in the
    context of the manner in which she testified. Did she go too far, was she
    too zealous and that sort of thing; and decide what weight you will put on.
    I do not think it should be blown out of proportion from the point of view
    of the overall defence of Mr. Rowe.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge was correct to instruct the jury to disregard Dr.
    Henry’s evidence that, in her opinion, the appellant was being truthful with
    Carty during their meeting. In this respect, clearly her evidence usurped
    the function of the jury and called for a clear warning from the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    trial counsel for the defence in his closing address told the jury that Dr.
    Henry’s opinion in this respect was inadmissible, it was not sufficient,
    in my view for the trial judge to leave it at that. The jury are told to
    take the law from the judge and, in my view, this was important evidence
    which the trial judge was required to address. It was his function to state
    clearly for the jury what use they could and could not make of it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    his remarks went well beyond what was required. His personal attack on the
    witness’s integrity was uncalled for. While Dr. Henry possesses impressive
    and extensive credentials in her area of expertise, she is the equivalent
    of a layperson, however, in terms of the admissibility of evidence. The evidence,
    which motivated the trial judge’s rebuke, was elicited by Crown counsel in
    cross-examination. She was asked by Crown counsel whether in this case she
    would “… go the whole distance and say that Marlon Rowe was truthful on the
    tape …” to which she responded that from what she had seen on the tape she
    believed he was being truthful. In so doing she merely responded to the questions
    put to her and, as such, was quite undeserving of the castigation she received
    in the trial judge’s charge. It would have been sufficient for the trial
    judge to point out that it was not for Dr. Henry to express an opinion on
    who was being truthful, that this is the sole function for the jury, and
    that they must ignore her evidence in this respect. Because the entire defence
    (once the statement to Carty was admitted) was that the shooting was accidental,
    it was particularly important for the trial judge to exercise caution in
    his remarks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Henry’s evidence, along with that of Dr. Case, was of vital importance to
    the defence. Essentially, that evidence was that, from their observations
    of the tapes: Carty was practising Obeah; that the appellant appeared to
    believe in Obeah; and it was important for the believer to be truthful with
    the practitioner or else there would be, in effect, no benefit to the believer.
    The appellant told Carty that the shooting was accidental. If the jury accepted
    that the appellant was truthful when he made this statement, or even that
    it raised a reasonable doubt in that regard, the jury would have been obliged
    to acquit him of the murder charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am satisfied, however, that the trial judge’s remarks after the luncheon
    recess went a long way to ameliorating his criticisms of Dr. Henry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    the trial judge stressed that while Dr. Henry had overstepped her bounds,
    this was neither the fault of nor contemplated by defence counsel. As the
    trial judge noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>She went, in
    my opinion, far too far. I have made that clear to you. I do not want you
    to in any way take that as any adverse inference against Mr. Midanik or his
    client.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the defence also had the benefit of Dr. Case’s evidence, which
    was essentially the same as Dr. Henry’s, namely that, from his observations:
    Carty was practising Obeah; the appellant appeared to be a believer; and
    it was of the utmost importance for the believer to be truthful with the
    practitioner. In his charge to the jury the trial judge referred to Dr. Case’s
    evidence in some detail including Dr. Case’s expert opinion that “it would
    be impossible for a practitioner to help a client if the client does not
    tell the truth.” The trial judge’s fair and detailed treatment of Dr. Case’s
    evidence, which was so similar to that of Dr. Henry, was an effective antidote
    to the denigration of Dr. Henry. Ultimately the defence position in relation
    to the expert evidence was fairly put to the jury. The defence also had the
    non-expert evidence of Thompson, who reported that the appellant had told
    her on the very day of the killing and robbery that he had “accidentally” shot
    Mrs. Kidd and that he was remorseful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    importance of the appellant’s belief in Carty and whether he was truthful
    in everything he said to Carty was also brought home for the jury in the
    recharge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Now, there is
    one point that I actually had clearly intended to tell you and I did not;
    and I slipped up for sure, but it is a point that should have been made in
    the context just like any other point. When you are considering the position
    of the defence and the question of whether the Crown has proved beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the shooting was not an accident and you are looking
    at Mr. Rowe talking to Carty … you should realize that the fact that the
    accused man might have been there for the purpose of getting protection for
    escape, the fact that it even could be a conversation that has criminal connotations
    and could be described as a criminal conversation, does not mean that he
    did not believe in Carty. It is Mr. Rowe’s belief system at the time. When
    he was talking to Mr. Carty, was he such a believer of Obeah—believing in
    the experience from what you viewed on the tape—that he would be telling
    the truth to Mr. Carty?  The fact that there might have been criminal implications
    or he might be devising a plan to escape or protection to assist him to escape
    within the Obeah spiritual world does not matter. What you are looking at
    is, does what Mr. Rowe told Mr. Carty raise a reasonable doubt in your mind
    as to whether or not the shooting was intentional? Was Rowe telling the truth
    to Carty or are you left in a state of reasonable doubt about that?  The
    fact that they are talking about escape or when it is safe to leave, money
    and all of these other things is not prohibitive or is not determinative
    of the issue; and that is, was Rowe telling the truth or are you left in
    a state of reasonable doubt as to whether he was telling the truth and therefore
    left in a state of reasonable doubt on the question of whether the shooting
    was accidental? Knowing that the Crown must prove that the shooting was not
    an accident.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Now, there is
    one other point in connection with this. You remember how Mr. Midanik sort
    of apologized, but went through—and carefully—how the 25 areas mentioned
    in the statement are confirmed by other evidence. He went through it and
    showed you. I did not list all 25 like Champs going to Jamaica and on and
    on. The point of doing that was to show you that he was telling the truth.
    It can be independently established by other evidence—and it was—that, on
    25 points in this session, he was telling the truth to Carty. Therefore,
    why wouldn’t he be telling him the truth about how the shooting occurred?
    That is the point of that. I did not go through all 25 and I do not intend
    to. You will remember when he did and you have got the transcript, you will
    be looking at the tape and you will be able to remember, from your recollection
    of the evidence, the items in the statement that were proved by other evidence
    in the case to be reliable and trustworthy. That was the point of that.</p>

    trial judge disallowed this question and properly so in my view. Here, the
    defence did not meet its burden of showing an “air of reality”
    to its assertion that the appellant’s apparent or professed belief in Obeah
    had the realistic potential or possibility for partiality against him. There
    was no evidentiary foundation for the assertion, nor was there any reasonable
    basis upon which to take judicial notice of what was asserted. I would dismiss
    this ground of appeal.</p>

line-height:normal'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this court noted in <i>R. v. McLean</i> (2002), 170 C.C.C. (3d) 330 at 333,
    trial judges have a wide discretion in matters involving the challenge for
    cause process and, as such, “a highly rigid, technical approach”
    in assessing the adequacy of instructions given to the triers should be avoided.
    Instead, the correct approach is to consider whether, “viewed in their entirety,
    the instructions provided [the triers] with an adequate understanding of
    the nature of their task and the procedure they were to follow in order to
    select an impartial jury”. In <i>R. v. Brown </i>(2005), 194 C.C.C. (3d)
    76 at 85 Simmons J.A. of this court noted: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he fact that
    a trial judge may not have recited the precise words used in <i>Hubbert</i>,
    or may have omitted one or more of its recommended elements, does not necessarily
    give rise to reversible error. Rather, the issue to be determined is whether
    the circumstances of the particular case reveal a reasonable likelihood that
    the triers misunderstood the nature of their task and the procedure they
    were to follow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge did not instruct the triers that they were to determine whether
    a prospective juror was indifferent between the accused and the Crown on
    the balance of probabilities and that they could retire to the jury room
    to deliberate if necessary, when his instructions are reviewed in their entire
    context, I am not persuaded that there is any real likelihood that they misunderstood
    their task, the procedure they were to follow, or the importance of the process
    in which they were engaged. I would give no effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

    appellant acknowledges that the trial judge correctly directed the jury that
    utterances made in furtherance of the robbery were admissible against the
    appellant. The complaint here, not the subject of an objection at trial,
    is that the trial judge erred in failing to tell the jury that the utterances
    of other robbers had “absolutely no probative value as evidence of whether
    or not the appellant had fired his gun accidentally”. In essence, the complaint
    is that the co-conspirators’ utterances had no probative value on the issue
    of intent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept the Crown’s submission in response to this complaint that the defence
    of accident had to be considered within the context of the robbery as a whole
    and, most importantly, the events that occurred immediately before and after
    the shooting. Further, while the weight to be attached to the evidence was
    for the jury to determine, a “no probative value” instruction would, in the
    circumstances of this case, have amounted to reversible error. I would dismiss
    this ground of appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant complains that, when reviewing the evidence bearing on the issue
    of intent, the trial judge erroneously told the jury that Sihota and Wylie
    confirmed Lowry’s evidence about the threats uttered by the robber outside
    the vault (presumably the appellant) after the shooting. It is the appellant’s
    position that these witnesses, in reality, contradicted Lowry’s evidence
    and that, in telling the jury they corroborated her evidence, the trial judge
    erred in law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it is clear from a reading of this section of the charge as a whole,
    that the trial judge made it perfectly clear to the jurors that Lowry was
    the only one who heard the threat uttered by the appellant before the shot
    was fired and the only one who heard the appellant say, immediately after
    the shot was fired: “tell them I’ve just shot their friend out here”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not tell the jury that Sihota and Wiley actually heard the
    utterances made by the appellant from outside the vault. It is clear that
    the only utterances they heard were from inside the vault. I accept the Crown’s
    submission on this point that the <u>effect</u> of their evidence was to
    confirm that a message had been relayed from one robber to the other and
    then passed on to the captives. There was no misstatement of the evidence,
    and I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>

    S.C.C. refused, [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 29 the jury would have had to conclude,
    in the circumstances of this case, that the appellant was guilty of first
    degree murder, and any challenge advanced against the trial judge’s charge
    could not prevail. I agree. This ground was advanced principally to preserve
    the right of the appellant to advance it in the event of further appeal to
    the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>
