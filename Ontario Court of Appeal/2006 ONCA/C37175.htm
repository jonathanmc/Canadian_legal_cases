style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant Jody Robinson appeals from an order declaring him to be a dangerous
    offender and from a sentence of indeterminate detention.  At the appellant’s
    request, this appeal was dealt with in writing.  We have received extensive
    written submissions from counsel for the appellant and from Crown counsel.  For
    the following reasons the appeal is allowed, the dangerous offender order
    is set aside, and a new hearing is directed.  We have reached this conclusion
    principally on the basis that the trial judge did not consider the effect
    of the long-term offender provisions as required by <i>R. v. Johnson</i> (2003),
    177 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) and because of procedural defects resulting from
    by the prosecution experts’ and the trial judge’s reliance on findings stemming
    from convictions that were subsequently set aside by this court: see <i>R.
    v. Robinson</i> (2001), 153 C.C.C. (3d) 398 (Ont. C.A.).  We give no effect
    to the appellant’s argument that a dangerous offender finding was unreasonable
    and that this court should impose a fixed sentence or find the appellant
    to be a long-term offender.</p>

    appreciate the impact of the principal grounds of appeal, it is important
    to understand at least an outline of the chronology. We set out the essential
    features below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>1993      Appellant acquitted of sexual assault but convicted of anal
    intercourse.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>1995      Court of Appeal enters acquittal on anal intercourse charge.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>April 4, 1996      Appellant first sees Dr.&nbsp;Girgla, a psychiatrist,
    for counselling.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>March to July 1996      Appellant allegedly commits a series of offences
    involving L.S. [the London complainant]; the offences allegedly occurred
    in London and Mississauga, but were tried in London.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>July 27, 1996      Appellant attacks S.N. [the Toronto complainant]; this
    attack gives rise to the predicate offences.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>July 29, 1996      Appellant keeps regular appointment with Dr. Girgla;
    Dr.&nbsp;Girgla notices nothing unusual despite the fact that two days earlier
    the appellant viciously assaulted S.N.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>August 1, 1997      Amendments to Part XXIV of <i>Criminal Code</i>, including
    long-term offender provisions, come into force.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>November 1997      Appellant convicted of some, but not all, charges involving
    L.S. and sentenced to thirty months imprisonment; he appeals from these convictions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>April 19, 1999      With respect to the attack involving S.N., the appellant
    pleads guilty before McRae J. to sexual assault with a weapon, sexual assault
    causing bodily harm, unlawful confinement and uttering death threats.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    and imposes an indeterminate sentence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    orders a new trial; Crown draws up two indictments for London and Mississauga
    charges</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>October 9, 2001      Crown withdraws London indictment</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>September 26, 2003      Supreme Court of Canada releases reasons for judgment
    in <i>R. v. Johnson</i> and companion cases:  <i>R. v. Edgar</i> (2003),
    177 C.C.C. (3d) 122; <i>R. v. Kelly</i> (2003), 177 C.C.C. (3d) 126; <i>R.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    because the complainant is unwilling to return to Canada to testify at a
    new trial.</p>

      FACTS</span></h4>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      predicate offences</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge characterized the offences against S.N. as offences of a brutal
    nature.  We agree with that characterization.  The following brief summary
    can hardly capture the seriousness of the crimes committed by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    Saturday, July 27, 1996, the appellant met S.N. and her friend in a bar.
    He made a number of attempts to have S.N. agree to go home with him. Eventually,
    she agreed to go to his car to exchange business cards so that they could
    make a future date. Once in the car, the appellant drove off with S.N. and
    headed to an isolated area, north of Toronto.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    S.N. trapped in the car, the appellant began a series of horrendous acts
    against her. Over the course of the evening and in several locations he beat
    her, anally raped her on multiple occasions and forced her to put a stick
    in her anus and vagina. While terrorizing S.N. with threats of death, he
    repeatedly forced her to perform fellatio on him. He held a knife to her
    throat, whipped her with his belt and burnt her breast with a cigarette.
    She was compelled to burn herself, to play with herself for the appellant,
    and to ejaculate him. On several occasions the appellant defecated or urinated
    in S.N.’s mouth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    string of brutal acts continued until the appellant suddenly backed away
    from S.N. as if in shock and said: “Oh my God, I’m sorry. I can’t believe
    I did this to you.” He picked up a rope that he had removed from his trunk
    and said he was going to hang himself; he did not and he returned to the
    car. The appellant began to cry and said that he did not see S.N., but rather
    his ex-girlfriend (L.S.). He then drove S.N. back to the bar where she retrieved
    her car. She went home and called the police.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      impact on the victim</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s offences have had a devastating impact on the victim.  She initially
    attempted to return to work, but remained only a couple of months before
    she had to resign.  She was also unable to return to school.  Her relationship
    with a man that she was considering marrying ended.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    February 1997, the victim had a complete break down.  She had had a kidney
    transplant before the attack.  The transplanted kidney went into irreversible
    rejection, possibly as a result of the stress from the attack.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    years later, the victim’s life was beginning to return to some semblance
    of normalcy when she was told by the police that these proceedings were beginning.  She
    began to have nightmares again and needed to take tranquilizers.  She has
    begun a new relationship with another man, but the relationship is strained
    and she remains fearful of men and of walking alone.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant’s therapy before the attack</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    April 1996, the appellant attended at a Toronto area hospital and was referred
    to Dr. Girgla for counselling.  The appellant reported that he had difficulty
    with a relationship with a woman in London.  He said that he had moved to
    London to be with her, but later found out that she was seeing other men.  He
    reported that he was very jealous and believed that he had problems controlling
    women.  Dr. Girgla saw the appellant weekly from May 10 to July 29, 1996.  Remarkably,
    when Dr. Girgla saw the appellant on July 29, only two days after the attack
    on S.N., the appellant seemed normal.  Nothing in his presentation on that
    day suggested that anything was disturbing him or that he had done anything
    unusual.  He said he was finally getting over the break-up with his ex-girlfriend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Girlga testified that, having spent so much time with the appellant without
    detecting any indication of the type of activity displayed in the predicate
    offences, it was apparent that the appellant had deep-seated problems. These
    problems far exceeded those for which Dr.&nbsp;Girgla was providing assistance.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      expert evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only
    the Crown called expert evidence at the dangerous offender hearing.  Of the
    three experts, only Dr. Wilson, a psychologist, had spoken to the appellant.  The
    appellant refused to speak to the Crown’s two expert psychiatrists, Dr. Glancy
    and Dr. Klassen.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(a)       <i>Dr.
        Wilson</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Robin Wilson met with the appellant at the Toronto Gaol where he was awaiting
    the Crown’s decision as to whether to proceed with the dangerous offender
    application.  The purpose of the interview was to provide an opinion whether
    the appellant should be held until expiry of the 30-month sentence on the
    London charges.  Dr. Wilson was aware of the facts underlying the Toronto
    convictions and a 1993 sexual assault allegation of which the appellant had
    been acquitted on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Wilson testified that the appellant was eager to talk to him.  However, because
    the appellant had been advised not to talk about the Toronto offences he
    said very little about them.  He also said very little about the London charges
    and the London victim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Wilson concluded that the appellant suffered from a sexual behavioural disorder
    known as paraphilia.  The paraphilia included components of sadism (deriving
    sexual pleasure from inflicting pain on others), rape proneness (deriving
    sexual pleasure from non-consensual sex), urophilia (sexual interest in urine),
    and coprophilia (sexual interest in feces).  Dr. Wilson considered certain
    actuarial measures of dangerousness including the Psychopathy Checklist Revised
    (PCL-R) and the Sexual Offender Risk Appraisal Guide (SORAG), but concluded
    that he did not have sufficient information about the appellant to use those
    tests. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    concern with all of the expert evidence was that the experts had originally
    been given a great deal of information.  That information did not accord
    with the evidence placed before the trial judge.  More importantly for the
    purposes of this appeal, the experts to some degree relied upon a version
    of facts relating to the London convictions.  However, all the experts were
    asked whether they could make the sexual sadism diagnosis on the basis of
    the Toronto offences alone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Wilson testified that his diagnosis could be made on the basis of the Toronto
    offences alone.  He also testified that the abnormality of the Toronto facts
    lead to a diagnosis of sadism that is predictive of future sadistic behaviour:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Using the information
    found in the agreed statement of fact, the description of the events and
    the nature of the behaviour that took place … it is my opinion that any ...
    clinician of reasonable competence would arrive at a diagnosis much the same
    as mine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    Dr. Wilson also relied on the London convictions and their underlying facts
    to support his conclusions.  He noted similarities between the facts of the
    two sets of offences, especially the urination, defecation and use of foreign
    objects, which added a certain degree of reliability to his diagnosis:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The information
    available with respect to the offence history for Toronto is in and of itself
    sufficient to make the diagnosis.  The information from London adds a certain
    degree … of reliability to that …
    diagnosis.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>While
    he went on (in response to a leading question from Crown counsel) to affirm
    that his diagnosis stands even if he were to “factor out” the London offences,
    he continued to refer to information relating to the London offences during
    his testimony.  For example, he referred to the psychological impact on the
    London victim, and relied on the London occurrence as an indication that
    the appellant’s behaviour in the Toronto occurrence was not an isolated incident.  However,
    he also testified that “on an actuarial basis, [it] would be highly improbable” that
    the Toronto incident was an isolated event since he had
    “great difficulty conceiving how anybody could … commit the types of offences
    that Mr. Robinson committed without meeting [his] diagnosis [of sexual sadism]”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notably,
    Dr. Wilson testified that the two sets of offences revealed a pattern of
    behaviour that could be the basis for a dangerous offender finding.  However,
    since the Crown does not rely on a pattern of behaviour as a basis for the
    dangerous offender finding, we need not further consider this part of Dr.
    Wilson’s opinion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Wilson considered the appellant to be at high risk to re-offend on the basis
    of the Toronto offences alone.  He testified that there is no cure for a
    paraphilic disorder. While treatment stands a reasonable chance of aiding
    an offender to remain offence free, it would be particularly difficult for
    the appellant to achieve success even with treatment to control his urges
    to engage in aggressive sexual behaviour.  He believed that the appellant
    would still be at risk to re-offend after serving a lengthy (14-year) penitentiary
    sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Wilson also pointed out the high cost of failure because of the seriousness
    of the harm (including death) a sexual sadist may inflict on his victim.
    He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>However, being
    that is my opinion that [sexually sadistic behaviour] is his preference,
    and given that if he should happen to have a momentary lapse and fall back
    into that preference, the risk of him harming somebody to the extent that
    the victims in these cases were harmed is a risk that I don’t think the community
    can take.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Wilson testified that the treatment that might be available for the appellant
    would have to include relapse prevention therapy and medication to reduce
    his sex drive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Wilson was asked about the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
    Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) definition of sexual sadism.  He acknowledged that
    to make a diagnosis of paraphilia, including sexual sadism, the DSM-IV requires
    that the relevant fantasies, urges or behaviour persist for a period of at
    least six months. This requirement safeguards against making a diagnosis
    with an insufficient basis.  Dr.&nbsp;Wilson, however, considered that he
    could make the diagnosis in the appellant’s case using his own definition
    which, in his view, was more generally accepted in the sexological community
    than the DSM-IV definition.</p>

    of dangerous offender proceedings.  Dr. Glancy knew and respected Dr. Wilson
    and relied on his findings, particularly given the fact that Dr. Wilson had
    the opportunity to meet with the appellant.  His findings were generally
    consistent with Dr. Wilson’s, although he considered rape proneness, urophilia
    and coprophilia as incorporated in the sexual sadism diagnosis.  </p>

    Glancy was also asked to “factor out” the London offences.  He too was still
    prepared to make the sexual sadism diagnosis: “[B]ut it could not be made
    as firmly if there were not the two incidents but nevertheless the Toronto
    incident or series of incidents in and of themselves clearly suggests the
    diagnosis and it’s not uncommon that we see people with just one incident
    of a sexually sadistic nature”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Glancy agreed that based only on the Toronto offences, the appellant did
    not fit the DSM-IV criteria, but he explained that for the purposes of making
    the diagnosis in this case that was not important.  In the course of his
    explanation Dr. Glancy seemed to rely upon the “supportive evidence from
    the London incident”.  He also seemed to engage in the somewhat circular
    reasoning that since sexual sadists are known to have engaged in thoughts,
    fantasies and urges for a long period of time prior to engaging in the sexually
    sadistic behaviour, “this would fulfill the DSM-IV criteria”.  Dr. Glancy
    came to this conclusion with no information that the appellant had in fact
    engaged in those kinds of thoughts and fantasises before the London or Toronto
    offences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Glancy was also of the view that the Toronto incident could not be viewed
    as an isolated incident in response to the break-up of the appellant’s relationship
    with the London victim.  As he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>When we add
    in the Toronto incident, which was more brutal, more clearly indicated some
    planning and rehearsal and also wasn’t directly in the setting of the break-up
    of the relationship, it was some time after the break-up of the relationship
    and in fact at a time where he was in psychiatric treatment and appeared
    to be resolving the feelings engendered by the break-up of the relationship,
    it actually suggests that this was more clearly evidencing acting out on
    a sexually sadistic fantasy than being related to the break-up of the relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Glancy testified that many people in the field believe that sexual sadists
    are not treatable through cognitive behavioural therapy and that there is
    little evidence that sadists have been successfully treated.  He also testified
    that “many in the field would feel uncomfortable treating [sexual sadists]
    in the community even by [sex drive reducing medications]” because “there’s
    very little documented evidence that any methods actually work with sexual
    sadists, and second of all, the risks are so high if treatment fails”.  Dr.&nbsp;Glancy
    surmised that the offences that the appellant committed in the future would
    likely be of a similar nature because of what seemed to be an ingrained sexual
    preference.  He also pointed out that the crimes of some sexual sadists escalate
    and that “even the two groups of offences before the Court seem to show some
    element of escalation in a short period of time”.</p>

    Glancy predicted that the appellant would be difficult to manage in the community
    because of his demonstrated ability to deceive his therapist.  If he were
    released into the community, he would require lifelong monitoring.  However,
    Dr.&nbsp;Glancy also testified that if various other problematic aspects
    of the appellant’s character could be managed, such as his drinking, then “it’s
    possible that he could be managed with sex drive reducing medication”.</p>

    Philip Klassen is also a forensic psychiatrist.  He is a consultant at the
    Clarke Institute of Psychiatry and head of the forensic consultation service
    at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.  He has dealt with over a
    thousand sex offenders and one of his areas of expertise is in the diagnosis
    of disorders suffered by violent and sexual offenders.  As with the other
    experts, Dr. Klassen originally came to his opinion based upon the London
    and Toronto offences.  An additional concern with Dr.&nbsp;Klassen’s opinion
    was that he had completed actuarial assessments of the appellant using the
    SORAG and the Static-99 test based on information from the London and Toronto
    offences as well as other information not in evidence before the trial judge.  During
    the hearing, he was asked to redo the assessments without this information.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like
    the other experts, it was Dr. Klassen’s opinion that, on the basis of the
    Toronto offences alone, the appellant suffers from paraphilia consistent
    with sexual sadism.  Taking into account the London offences shows the escalation
    in the seriousness of conduct usually seen with sexual sadists.  Dr. Klassen
    pointed out a number of aspects of the Toronto incident that were highly
    consistent with sexual sadism.  He did not believe that the appellant was
    a psychopath, but he did opine that the appellant suffered from a personality
    disorder.</p>

    Klassen testified that, until they are apprehended, sadists will continue
    to offend.  There is little information about recidivism among sadists because
    there are so few and they are rarely released from custody due to the seriousness
    of their crimes.  The actuarial tools that Dr. Klassen used showed that the
    appellant was in a category of persons with a high likelihood to re-offend.  If
    he were released, the appellant would need to receive psychological treatment
    and treatment with sex-drive reducing drugs for the foreseeable future.</p>

    Code</i>.  In making these findings the trial judge appeared to rely upon
    the London and Toronto offences except in relation to s.&nbsp;753(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii).  That
    finding was based solely on the Toronto offences.  Section 753(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii)
    provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>753. (1) The

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(<i>a</i>) that
    the offence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Even in the

    August 1, 1997, amendments to Part XXIV of the <i>Criminal Code</i> came
    into force.  These amendments created a long-term offender regime.  On this
    appeal, Mr.&nbsp;Leibovich, who was not Crown counsel at trial, concedes
    that the trial judge should have considered the new provisions.  The applicability
    of the long-term offender provisions was authoritatively determined by the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Johnson</i> in 2003, some three years
    after the hearing concluded in this case.  In <i>Johnson, </i>the Supreme
    Court held that the accused was entitled to the benefit of the new regime,
    which was in force at the time of his second trial, even though he committed
    the predicate offence before the regime came into effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    importance of the new regime to a potential candidate for a dangerous offender
    designation lies principally in the availability of the less Draconian designation
    of long-term offender.  As the court pointed out in <i>Johnson</i> at para.
    31:  “Almost every offender who satisfies the dangerous offender criteria
    will satisfy the first two criteria in the long-term offender provisions.”  The
    first two criteria for a long-term offender designation as set out in s.
    753.1(1) are that (a) it would be appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment
    of two years or more; and (b) there is a substantial risk that the offender
    will reoffend.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    the court held that even if an offender meets the criteria for a dangerous
    offender designation, the sentencing judge must still consider the applicability
    of the long-term offender provisions.  Thus, leaving aside all the other
    arguments raised by the appellant in this case, it is no answer to his appeal
    that the trial judge found that he was a dangerous offender.  Put another
    way, a court need not determine that the appellant does not meet the dangerous
    offender criteria before it can find the appellant to be a long-term offender:
    see <i>R. v. Johnson</i> at para. 39.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that this appeal should be dismissed notwithstanding this error
    in law because the evidence adduced at the hearing did not demonstrate the
    third pre-requisite for a long-term offender designation, namely that “there
    is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community.”  We
    will consider this submission further after dealing with the other errors
    alleged by the appellant.</p>

    indicated in the above chronology, at the time of the dangerous offender
    hearing the appellant had been convicted of offences in relation to L.S.  Although
    those convictions were under appeal, Crown counsel at trial argued that he
    could rely on them and their underlying facts without calling L.S.  The trial
    judge agreed and held that the Crown could rely upon the findings of fact
    made by the London trial judge in sentencing the appellant.  The trial judge
    also held that the transcript of evidence from the London trial was admissible
    for its truth and as proof of the underlying facts of the convictions.  Finally,
    the trial judge ruled that, by reason of the <i>res judicata</i> doctrine,
    it was not open to the appellant to challenge those facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated in the chronology, after the appellant was found to be a dangerous
    offender and sentenced, this court set aside the London convictions and ordered
    a new trial.  The Crown has since stayed those charges as it has apparently
    been unable to convince the London complainant to return to Canada to testify.  Crown
    counsel on this appeal concedes that the prosecution cannot rely upon the
    transcripts of the London trial as proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the
    underlying facts.  We agree with that concession. As Crown counsel fairly
    points out, with the overturning of the convictions, the whole basis for
    the trial judge’s ruling as to the conclusiveness of the London trial judge’s
    findings and use of the London trial transcript had been removed.  This court
    set aside the appellant’s convictions at the London trial because of serious
    errors in the conduct of the trial that deprived the appellant of a fair
    trial.  It would not be appropriate to permit the prosecution in this proceeding
    to rely upon findings that were tainted in this way.  It would also not be
    appropriate to permit the Crown at this stage to rely upon the transcript
    of the London complainant’s evidence as proof of the facts of those offences
    when, because of the trial judge’s ruling, the appellant had no opportunity
    to challenge those facts. Because the trial judge based his ruling on application
    of the <i>res judicata</i> doctrine he did not have to consider whether the
    transcript might be admissible on some other basis as, for example, as an
    exception to the hearsay rule. However, we should not be taken as having
    decided that a dangerous offender finding can never be upheld because some
    of the convictions upon which the finding was based were subsequently set
    aside on appeal.  That issue was not fully argued in the written submissions.  </p>

    counsel on this appeal argues that no substantial wrong was occasioned because
    a close examination of the expert evidence indicates that their opinions

    London case.  The Crown also argues that the trial judge would have found
    the appellant to be a dangerous offender even in the absence of the London
    findings.  Again, we will consider this issue after dealing with the appellant’s

    identified any particular principle of fundamental justice that is engaged
    by its admission. The appellant was convicted and sentenced in London before
    a superior court.  That verdict and sentence was lawful and the appellant
    was serving a lawful sentence.  He availed himself of the statutory right
    of appeal but, until the conviction was set aside, he was lawfully held in

    Dr. Wilson’s evidence was lawfully obtained, the exclusionary rule in s.&nbsp;24(2)
    of the <i>Charter</i> has no application.  We note that where the admission

    of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, that evidence must be excluded:
    see <i>R. v. Harrer</i> (1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at paras. 16

    para. 16, La Forest J. held that “in determining whether evidence should
    be admitted into evidence, [Canadian courts must] be guided by our sense

    the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Jones</i> (1994),

    the accused had been examined, on a court-ordered remand, by two psychiatrists
    and a psychologist to determine whether he was fit to stand trial.  He was
    not told that the results of the examinations might be used to determine
    whether he was a dangerous offender.  The Crown later did bring a dangerous
    offender application and sought to rely upon the evidence of the psychiatrists
    and the psychologist.  A majority of the Supreme Court held that the evidence
    was properly admitted and that the accused’s <i>Charter</i> rights were not
    infringed.  Speaking for the majority at p. 396, Gonthier J. stressed the
    importance of a court being given access to the widest possible range of
    information in a dangerous offender hearing.  He concluded that where psychiatric
    evidence has been legally obtained pursuant to a court-ordered remand the
    evidence should be admitted.  As he said at p. 399, s. 7 “does not extend
    to a denial of critical evaluative evidence from psychiatrists legally gained
    at the pre-trial evaluation that may show whether the offender could qualify
    as a dangerous offender.”  Dr. Wilson’s examination was lawfully conducted
    and the evidence was lawfully obtained.  Its admission at the dangerous offender

    appellant submits that the order declaring him to be a dangerous offender
    was unreasonable.  There is no merit to this submission.  There was sufficient
    evidence based solely on the Toronto offences to satisfy a finding that the
    appellant is a dangerous offender within the meaning of s. 753(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii).  For
    convenience we repeat that provision:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>753. (1) The
    court may, on application made under this Part following the filing of an
    assessment report under subsection 752.1(2), find the offender to be a dangerous
    offender if it is satisfied</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(<i>a</i>) that
    the offence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal
    injury offence described in paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the definition of that
    expression in section 752 and the offender constitutes a threat to the life,
    safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons on the basis of
    evidence establishing</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(iii) any behaviour
    by the offender, associated with the offence for which he or she has been
    convicted, that is of such a brutal nature as to compel the conclusion that
    the offender’s behaviour in the future is unlikely to be inhibited by normal
    standards of behavioural restraint; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, a trier of fact could reasonably find that the appellant’s treatment
    of the Toronto victim was of “such a brutal nature as to compel the conclusion
    that the offender’s behaviour in the future is unlikely to be inhibited by
    normal standards of behavioural restraint”.  The brutality of the crimes
    committed by the appellant is self-evident and this conduct is so beyond
    the normal range of behaviour that it is a reasonable inference that the
    appellant was unlikely to be inhibited by normal standards of behavioural
    restraint.  The experts were able to diagnose the appellant as a sexual sadist
    based solely on the Toronto offences.  Given that diagnosis, the appellant
    fit comfortably within the definition of a dangerous offender in s. 753(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. Contrary to the appellant’s submissions, the
    dangerous offender finding did not depend on the London convictions.  The
    facts of the London convictions simply strengthened the experts’ opinions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant points out that when the information relating to the London convictions
    was removed from Dr. Klassen’s actuarial assessments, the appellant achieved
    lower scores on these tests.  Counsel for the appellant has also conducted
    a thorough review of the scoring of the various tests to show their frailties
    given the evidence available in this case.  There is no doubt that this hearing
    was a difficult one because of the need to sort out the admissible and reliable
    evidence upon which the experts’ opinions could be based.  This problem was  exacerbated
    in this court because of the removal of the London convictions as a basis
    for making a dangerous offender finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s argument, however, overlooks the core concern in this case.  The
    appellant was diagnosed by three experts as a sexual sadist, the most extreme
    form of paraphilia.  The experts explained why they were confident in their
    opinions even though the appellant did not meet the DSM-IV definition.  A
    trier of fact would be entitled to accept this evidence and their explanations.  These
    experts testified that there was no known effective treatment for this disorder
    (short of castration) that could protect the public.  The appellant offered
    nothing at the hearing to rebut this evidence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Johnson</i> at para. 50, the Supreme Court of Canada held that it will
      only be in the rarest of cases that a new hearing will not be required
      where a judge has failed to consider the long-term offender provisions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Where the error
    of law consists of the sentencing judge’s failure to consider the availability
    of the long-term offender provisions, it is in only the rarest of circumstances,
    if any, that there will be no reasonable possibility that the sentencing
    judge would have imposed a different sentence but for the error. The criteria
    set out in the long-term offender provisions are substantially different
    from the criteria set out in the dangerous offender provisions. Therefore,
    the evidence and arguments that are relevant under the long-term offender
    application are not precisely the same as the evidence and arguments that
    are relevant under the dangerous offender application. <i>Absent a thorough
    inquiry into the suitability of the long-term offender provisions at the
    sentencing hearing, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for an appellate
    court to be satisfied that the sentencing options available pursuant to the
    long-term offender provisions would have been incapable of reducing the threat
    of harm to an acceptable level</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues that this is one of those rare cases.  Counsel submits that
    based on the predicate (Toronto) offences alone the evidence shows that the
    appellant is a sexual sadist.  The Crown also submits that the evidence at
    the hearing demonstrates that there is no reasonable prospect of treatment
    within the period of a determinate sentence and the maximum (ten-year) community
    supervision order available pursuant to a long-term offender designation.  He
    submits that the viability of control in the community was canvassed with
    the experts and that the evidence shows that the appellant’s condition is
    untreatable and that he will remain a significant danger in the foreseeable
    future.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    there is much to this submission, we are unable to accept it.  The risk of
    harm if the appellant were sentenced to a determinate sentence was canvassed
    with the experts and they were all of the view that the appellant would remain
    a high risk to the community after serving a determinate sentence.  They
    were, moreover, relatively pessimistic about the possibility of any kind
    of effective treatment at any time and they pointed out the high cost of
    failure.  However, the question of risk following a determinate sentence
    and a ten-year supervision order was not canvassed with the experts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “<i>Johnson</i> problem” is
    complicated in this case by the use of the London allegations.  While the
    experts were all prepared to come to a conclusion that the appellant was
    a sexual sadist solely on the basis of the Toronto offences, it is also fair
    to say that their opinions were strengthened by their knowledge of the appellant’s
    conduct with the London victim.  The London evidence also seems to have been
    a factor in the experts’ conclusions as to the likelihood of re-offending.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, although Dr. Wilson was prepared to make his diagnosis solely on
    the basis of the Toronto offences, we think it fair to say that the strength
    of his opinion as to the likelihood that the appellant would re-offend depended,
    in part, on his understanding that the appellant had engaged in prior sexual
    assaults of a similar nature.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are also concerned that, although the experts were prepared to give an opinion
    solely on the basis of the Toronto offences, this was never the case that
    the appellant had to meet.  He was always confronted with both sets of offences.  It
    is not possible to say what evidence the appellant might have been able to
    adduce if he had only had to meet the Toronto offences or if he had been
    in a position to challenge the evidence of the London complainant.</p>

    while we are not prepared to find that the dangerous offender designation
    in this case was unreasonable, we also cannot be satisfied that no miscarriage
    of justice resulted from the failure to consider the long-term offender provisions
    against the background of a record limited to the Toronto offences.  Accordingly,
    there must be a new hearing.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    add that we should not be taken as having decided that evidence of the London
    conduct is inadmissible at a new hearing in some form.  That issue was not
    before us.  It may be that the London complainant will be prepared to testify
    at the new hearing or that her trial evidence will be admissible in some
    fashion, perhaps as an exception to the hearsay rule.  That will be a matter
    for the judge presiding at the new hearing. </p>
