style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Mitchell appeals from his conviction, by a jury presided over by Justice
    Jennings, for sexual assault with a weapon.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  The
    conviction arose out of a series of events that took place in the appellant’s
    apartment on the night of February 5-6, 2000, after he and the complainant
    had been drinking, and which involved what the appellant says was the consensual
    enactment of a bondage fantasy.  The Crown says it was a non-consensual sexual
    assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises two issues on appeal.  First, he submits that the trial
    judge erred in his charge to the jury in failing to correct various comments
    made by Crown counsel in closing, which comments were (a) not based on the
    evidence, (b) unfairly prejudicial to the defence, and (c) in some cases
    inflammatory.  Secondly, he argues that the trial judge erred by analyzing
    the defence expert evidence about alcohol blackouts in his charge in a way
    that (a) misstated some of the that evidence, (b) ignored another part of
    the expert evidence, and (c) encouraged the jury to consider the wrong question
    in relation to the expert evidence as it pertained to the heart of the defence
    theory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>The Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, a lawyer, met the complainant, N.H., in the summer of 1999.  She
    was living on the street.  He gave her some money, spoke to her sympathetically,
    and took her to dinner.  They became friends and developed a platonic relationship.  The
    complainant sometimes slept on the couch in the living room in his apartment
    when she had nowhere to go.  Prior to the events in question, there had been
    no sexual interaction between them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    Saturday, February 5, 2000, the complainant called the appellant around 6:00
    o’clock in the evening because she needed a place to stay.  The appellant
    agreed she could stay with him and she went to the apartment.  They smoked
    some crack cocaine and drank alcoholic “mudslides”
    together.  “Mudslides” are an alcoholic drink each containing three ounces
    of spirits (one ounce of Kahlua, one ounce of vodka and one ounce of Baileys).  This
    much is not contested.  How much they consumed, and what happened thereafter,
    however, are the subjects of somewhat differing testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the complainant, she drank two mudslides between 8:00 p.m. and 11:30 or
    12 midnight.  She was lying on the couch and the appellant was sitting on
    the end.  They talked and watched television and she fell asleep, awakening
    around 3:00 or 3:30 the next morning.  When she awoke, she was lying on her
    stomach with her hands behind her back.  The appellant was straddling her
    and was tying her hands with a scarf.  She started screaming and he told
    her to shut up and to do what he said, and everything would be okay.  He
    pushed her face into the pillows, then got up, went somewhere, and came back
    with a knife and some duct tape.  He tightened the scarf around her wrists
    and put duct tape around her head and mouth.  Her hand was cut by the knife
    as she struggled, but she managed to roll over on her back and told the appellant
    she was going to vomit.  The appellant then helped her pull down the duct
    tape and got her scissors to help her cut the tape from her hair.  She put
    the knife away and the appellant gave her cab fare to go to the hospital
    to get medical treatment for the cut on her hand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s version of events is somewhat different.  He says that after
    the complainant arrived at his apartment around 5:30 or 6:00 o’clock, they
    each had two mudslides and agreed to smoke some crack.  The complainant left
    to get some crack and returned.  They smoked it and continued drinking mudslides.  Over
    the course of the evening, they consumed a thirteen-ounce bottle of Bailey’s,
    a thirteen-ounce bottle of Kahlua, and half of a twenty-six ounce bottle
    of vodka.  They were both extremely drunk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the appellant, he and the complainant continued to drink past midnight.  At
    some point they began to talk about sexual fantasies.  He talked about a
    group sex fantasy.  They both talked of fantasies of bondage, forced sex
    and rape.  He suggested they act out a fantasy of forced sex and the complainant
    agreed.  He got some scarves.  She lay on her stomach and put her hands behind
    her back.  The appellant tied the scarf around her wrists and then went to
    get some more “props”.  He returned with duct tape and a buck knife.  He
    put the duct tape on the complainant, but when he saw that she was genuinely
    struggling, he let her turn around and helped her get the tape off.  At that
    point he realized her hand was cut.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not in dispute that the appellant told the complainant either to shut
    up or to be quiet, to do what he said, and then everything would be alright.  The
    appellant says this was part of the role-play.  Nor is it disputed that he
    wrapped the duct tape around her head twice, including on her hair, covering
    from just below her nose to about her chin.  The complainant cut the duct
    tape out of her hair using scissors the appellant either got for her or told
    her where to find.  He gave her cab money to go to the hospital to have her
    cut hand treated.  When at the hospital, the complainant told the hospital
    staff, and later the police, that she had been sexually assaulted by the
    appellant and that the bondage fantasy had been done without her consent.  She
    did not tell the medical staff or the police that she and the appellant had
    been using crack.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant was a seasoned drinker.  She was drinking heavily and using crack
    cocaine during this period in her life.  On most weekends she got drunk.  She
    had experienced blackouts in the past because of excessive consumption of
    alcohol.  During these episodes, she had done things while drinking and then,
    after the fact, had been unable to remember what happened.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence theory was that the complainant went into an alcohol-induced blackout
    starting at about 11:30 -12 midnight and that, while in the blackout state,
    agreed to act out the consensual bondage fantasy.  This led to consensual,
    drunken activity, during which she emerged from the blackout, not remembering
    the discussions leading up to the events or her giving consent.  When the
    appellant realized that something was wrong, he immediately ceased the enactment
    of the fantasy, helped the complainant remove the tape and gave her money
    to go to the hospital for treatment of the cut.  The activity, while stupid
    and shameful, was not criminal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence called Dr. Douglas Gourlay, a doctor at the Centre for Addiction
    and Mental Health, as an expert on drug and alcohol use and abuse, including
    alcoholic blackouts.  The Crown led no evidence about blackouts.  Dr. Gourlay
    testified that alcoholic blackouts can last for minutes, hours or days, and
    that someone in a blackout continues to function normally<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a> but does not form long-term memory.  People
    around someone in a blackout would not know that the person was in such a
    state.  A person who has suffered blackouts in the past will generally require
    less alcohol over time to induce more blackouts.  The use of crack increases
    cravings for alcohol.  People can emerge from blackouts suddenly as a result
    of some shock, such as being cut with a knife.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Gourlay was asked about two hypothetical scenarios that roughly paralleled
    the versions of the appellant and the complainant, respectively, about how
    much they had had to drink, and the likelihood of a blackout resulting in
    such circumstances.  On the appellant’s version – at least six drinks, containing
    three ounces of liquor each, over the period of time between 5:30 - 6:00
    p.m. and 3:00 a.m. the following morning, plus some crack cocaine – Dr. Gourlay
    was of the opinion that “the likelihood of a blackout would be quite high,
    very high”.  On the complainant’s scenario – two such drinks between 8:00
    p.m. and 11:30 - midnight – his opinion was that the risk of blackout was
    lower but unpredictable.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    respects, arguing that her comments were prejudicial, not based on the evidence,
    and inflammatory.  He submits the trial judge failed to correct the improper

            had blacked out even if one accepted her evidence that she had only
            two 3-ounce drinks.  That “possibility” contrasted with his opinion
            that it was
          “very likely” that the complainant experienced a blackout if the appellant’s

            11:30, she would only have had about two or three ounces of alcohol
            in her body.  The Crown was entitled to use the expert evidence to
            point out that it would be very unlikely that the complainant blacked
            out from that level of alcohol in her system if one accepted her
            evidence.</span></p>

    Lindsay and Ms. Arnup agree on the law that applies to counsel’s jury addresses.  It
    is summarized in <i>R. v. Rose</i> (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at
    para. 104:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The purpose
    of the jury address was accurately described by Robert White, Q.C., in <i>The
    Art of Trial</i> (1993), at p. 213, as being “to present the party’s case
    clearly and in a way that is of help to the court in the performance of its
    duty.”  Generally speaking, counsel are
    “limited to reviewing and commenting on the evidence and to the making of
    submissions which may properly be supported by the evidence adduced”: see <i>Gray
    v. Alanco Developments Ltd.</i>, [1967] 1 O.R. 597 at p. 601, 61 D.L.R. (2d)
    652 (C.A.).  Nonetheless, few would deny the powerful persuasive force which
    well-crafted and skilfully presented submissions may have in a jury trial.</p>

    counsel, in particular, must show fairness and restraint.  He or she must
    be accurate and dispassionate and not misstate the evidence or make assertions
    for which there is no evidence.  This court commented on Crown counsel’s
    obligations in addressing the jury in <i>R. v. Nugent</i> (1995), 100 C.C.C.
    (3d) 89 (Ont. C.A.) at 96:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Crown’s

    by Chief Justice Lamer in <i>R. v. Swietlinski</i> (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d)
    449 at pp. 458-9, 119 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 309, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 481 [translation]:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    civil litigation.  [The] functions are quasi-judicial.  [The Crown’s] duty
    is not so much to obtain a conviction as to assist the judge and the jury
    in ensuring that the fullest possible justice is done.  [The Crown’s] conduct
    before the court must always be characterized by moderation and impartiality.  [The
    Crown] will have properly performed his duty and will be beyond all reproach
    if, eschewing any appeal to passion, and employing a dignified manner suited
    to [the] function, [the Crown] presents the evidence to the jury without
    going beyond what it discloses.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the case
    on appeal it is impossible to imagine that the cumulative effect of the uncorrected,
    inappropriate inferences and unsupported remarks by the Crown did not prejudice

    based on evidence that did not exist or that were contrary to the uncontradicted
    evidence of the defence expert, engaged in attempted oath-helping in respect
    of the complainant’s evidence, and inappropriately stereotyped the “status” of
    the complainant as compared to that of the appellant.  The appellant’s thirteen
    complaints about the Crown’s address, and his position with respect to them,

    Crown acknowledges that counsel’s address to the jury “may have contained
    a few remarks that were at the outer edge of permissible advocacy”, but argues
    that the trial judge’s charge as a whole, and the jury’s common sense, would
    have “neutralized any negative impact of the Crown’s hyperbole”.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"

    the Crown was entitled to ask the jury to draw from the evidence,<a

    the trial judge adequately corrected the two remarks the Crown agrees were

    Crown’s position with respect to each of the appellant’s thirteen complaints
    about the Crown address is also summarized in the foregoing chart.  On the
    record before us, and having particular regard to counsels’ addresses and
    the trial judge’s charge to the jury, read as a whole, I am satisfied that

    two most serious complaints relate, first, to the Crown’s remark in relation

    resistance that Mr. Mitchell finds gratifying”, and, secondly, to the Crown’s
    submissions about the possibility of a blackout.  </p>

    Crown concedes that there was no evidence to support the former statements
    or the Crown’s submission that the appellant did not derive sexual satisfaction
    unless his partner was not consenting.  However, the trial judge specifically
    instructed the jury that they were not permitted to draw such an inference.  He
    told the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Secondly, it
    was suggested that because of his rape fantasy, Mr. Mitchell could not obtain
    sexual gratification if there was consent to sexual activity.  That’s an
    example of an inference that cannot be drawn because of the lack of an evidentiary
    foundation.  No evidence was led as to the effects of rape fantasies on sexual
    gratification in general.  Mr. Mitchell simply stated that he had had rape
    fantasies in the past.</p>

    Crown’s remarks about the possibility of a blackout raise a more difficult
    concern.  As noted above, Dr. Gourlay testified that, on what amounted to
    the appellant’s version of consumption of alcohol, there was a very high
    likelihood that a woman in the complainant’s position would suffer a blackout,
    and that, on what amounted to the complainant’s scenario, the risk of blackout
    would be “lower”, but
    “unpredictable”.  In short, a blackout was possible based on the evidence
    of either the appellant or the complainant.  In her address to the jury,
    Crown counsel submitted that the complainant would not have had enough alcohol
    in her blood to suffer a blackout, even on the defence theory, but went on
    to say:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>The blackout
      defence depends upon you believing the accused’s version of the pattern
      of drinking.</i>  That is what forms the foundation of Dr. Gourlay’s opinion.  The
      accused cannot admit that [N.H.] had only two drinks.  On [N.H.’s] evidence,
      that she was only drinking between 8:00 and 11:30, the doctor had to say
      it was less likely she would have a blackout.  If she was not drunk, there
      would be no blackout.  No blackout, no consent [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    the extent this comment suggested the jury could only conclude the complainant
    suffered a blackout if they accepted the appellant’s version of consumption,
    it is clearly at odds with Dr. Gourlay’s testimony.  Ms. Arnup candidly acknowledges
    this.  However, Crown counsel immediately went on to say in her address that “on
    [N.H.’s] evidence, that she was only drinking between 8:00 and 11:30, <i>the
    doctor had to say it was less likely she would have a blackout</i>.”  This
    statement was consistent with Dr. Gourlay’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the trial judge correctly reviewed the expert’s evidence and made it clear
    to the jury that, although it was less likely on the complainant’s version
    of what had been consumed, a blackout was still possible even if they accepted
    her evidence.  He told the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The defence
    relies upon the evidence of Dr. Gourlay, who has experience in treating alcohol
    and drug addicted persons.  Dr. Gourlay gave you his opinion that if a 22-year-old
    woman who had used alcohol since she was 14, had frequently drunk to excess
    and was drunk most weekends, had experienced blackouts, if that woman was
    to drink six three-ounce drinks between 5:30 p.m. and 3:00 a.m., as well
    as smoke cocaine, the likelihood of blackout was quite high, was very high.  <i>He
    gave his opinion that if that person had two three-ounce drinks, as [the
    complainant] testified was the case, between 8:30 p.m. and 11:30, the risk
    of blackout would be lower.  The occurrence of a blackout is unpredictable,
    but there is still a risk.</i>  He gave his opinion that such a woman, if
    in an alcoholic blackout, could continue to talk, drink, and agree to act
    out a bondage fantasy during which she could come out of a blackout, having
    no memory of the agreement that had taken place in the blackout and be furious
    [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of the foregoing, the jury would not be left with the impression that
    they could only accept the “blackout” defence if they accepted the appellant’s
    version of what happened.  Thus, to the extent that Crown counsel may have
    overstepped the evidence in the first part of her remarks cited above, any
    prejudice that may have resulted to the appellant from that alone was adequately
    addressed by Crown counsel’s subsequent clarification and by the trial judge’s
    clear and accurate charge in this regard.  I would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel does not misstate the evidence simply because he or she asks the
    jury to view it differently than the accused urges.  As long as there is
    evidence to support a suggested inference, the Crown is not obliged to put
    to the jury a different inference that may be favoured by the defence.  This
    principle applies to dispose of the appellant’s complaints about (i) the
    Crown’s reference to the complainant’s knowledge of the appellant’s financial
    circumstances<a href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[6]</span></a>, (ii)
    the statements that the bruising on the complainant’s wrists and the cut
    on her hand were only consistent with the complainant’s version of non-consensual
    activity<a href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[7]</span></a>, and
    (iii) the Crown’s submission that the blood stains on the appellant’s shirt
    were more consistent with the complainant’s version of a more extensive struggle
    than that of the appellant.  The complaint about the Crown’s statement that
    the appellant held the knife against the complainant is inconsequential,
    since the knife must have been “against” the complainant at some point if
    she was cut by it and, in any event, no prejudice could have arisen from

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant complains that Crown counsel improperly undermined Dr. Gourlay’s
    expertise by suggesting that the jury was in as good a position as he to
    evaluate whether the complainant had had a blackout, since the evidence was
    that there is no test available to verify whether someone has experienced
    a blackout.  This was perhaps an unfortunate choice of phrase, but the Crown
    was entitled to point out weaknesses in the expert’s qualifications and I
    am not persuaded that the jury would have been influenced one way or another
    by the Crown’s remark; they knew Dr. Gourlay had been qualified by the trial
    judge as an expert, were aware of his extensive credentials, and could well
    arrive at their own conclusion as to his skills. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that Crown counsel engaged in impermissible oath-helping
    regarding the complainant’s testimony by stating –
    incorrectly, on the evidence – that she had been consistent from the outset
    about how much she had had to drink and that if the defence counsel had detected
    any inconsistency he would have cross-examined on it.  The Crown was in error
    in suggesting that the complainant had been completely consistent.  However,
    defence counsel pointed out these inconsistencies in his closing address,
    the jury was clearly instructed that they were to decide the case on the
    basis of the evidence before them alone, and I am not satisfied that there
    was any prejudice to the appellant from this erroneous statement by the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    I am not persuaded that any prejudice resulted from the Crown’s unfounded
    remark that because the complainant was not interested in engaging in group
    sex she was less likely to be interested in playing out a bondage fantasy,
    or from her remark about the appellant and the complainant having a different
    status in society.  The jury was warned by the trial judge to ignore speculative
    inferences, told to avoid prejudice or sympathy, and directed to base its
    verdict on the evidence.  This, and the jury’s own common sense, were sufficient
    to overcome any difficulties that may have been created by the Crown’s comments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant argues that Crown counsel misstated the evidence when she said
    the defence was being unfair in suggesting the complainant was lying to make
    her story more believable and that the complainant did not lie.  In considering
    this complaint, it will be helpful to note exactly what it was that Crown
    counsel said to the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>You heard [the
    complainant] testify about her fear of not being believed because she has
    no status in society.  It was the reason that she didn’t tell the doctors
    at Toronto Western Hospital and the police about smoking crack.  Defence
    counsel has characterized that as lying to make her story more believable.  That
    is completely unfair.  She did not lie.  She did not tell the police about
    the crack because she thought they would stop listening, that they wouldn’t
    care about what happened to her and that they would judge her for what she
    was, rather than what she was telling them had happened to her.  That is
    common sense.  Before the preliminary hearing, even before she had been examined
    in-chief, never mind cross-examined, she did tell the police about smoking
    crack; and because of that, defence counsel was able to cross-examine her
    about that at the preliminary inquiry and, of course, here in front of all
    of you.  [The complainant] didn’t have to tell the police about the crack.  If
    she had not told us, there would not have been any way of finding out. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my opinion, the appellant seeks to place much more emphasis on the sentence “She
    did not lie” than it deserves.  It was incorrect, in a literal sense, to
    suggest that the complainant had not lied; the complainant herself admitted
    that she misled the doctors and nurses at the hospital. The “lie” relied
    on was the failure to tell the medical staff at the hospital and the police
    that she and the appellant had been smoking crack cocaine that evening.  Crown
    counsel was not suggesting that anything other than that scenario was the
    case.  She was simply trying to attenuate the defence characterization of
    the failure to disclose as a “lie” by pointing out the complainant’s reason
    for having done so.  The jury could not have been under any misapprehension
    from Crown counsel’s statement that the complainant had not misled the medical
    staff and police that evening.  In addition, the trial judge told the jury
    clearly that the complainant “did not tell the doctors and, at first, did
    not tell the police about the use of cocaine at Mr. Mitchell’s flat.”  Nothing
    turns on the statement “She did not lie” by Crown counsel, in my opinion.</p>

line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, while Crown counsel regrettably overstated the evidence and her
    position in several instances during her closing address, I am not convinced
    that those statements prejudiced the appellant in any way that would justify
    the ordering of a new trial.  The trial judge clearly corrected the two most
    egregious instances and in other respects the criticized remarks either conformed
    to the evidence, when considered in their context, or constituted inferences
    that the Crown was entitled to ask the jury to draw, or were comments that
    the jury’s common sense and the trial judge’s instructions as a whole would
    overcome.</p>

    addition, the appellant attacks the following passage in the trial judge’s
    charge to the jury, dealing with the elimination of alcohol from the bloodstream,
    as factually misleading and prejudicial to the defence and, in substance,
    as a failure to put the defence position fairly to the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Dr. Gourlay
    said that the body eliminates one standard drink an hour, and perhaps something
    less for a woman, and he defined a standard drink as being one of one and
    a half ounces.  If two persons drank six three-ounce drinks, that would be
    the equivalent of 12 one and a half-ounce drinks over 9 to 10 hours.  It
    would appear from that evidence that 9 to 10 drinks would have been eliminated,
    leaving two or three drinks in the body.  If you accept that, in the light
    of [N.H.’s] evidence, it will be for you to determine whether Dr. Gourlay’s
    hypothetical situation is of assistance to you [in] determining whether or
    not [N.H.] went to sleep or stayed awake and had a blackout.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    Mr. Lindsay argues that in this passage the trial judge mischaracterized
    the defence position in a material way.  The defence position was that the
    complainant had gone into a blackout at around 11:30 - 12 midnight and emerged
    from the blackout at around 3:30 a.m. when the bondage incident took place.  Mr.
    Lindsay contends that by suggesting the drinking took place “over 9 to 10
    hours” the trial judge was asking the jury to consider whether the complainant
    went into the blackout at around 3:30 a.m. and was thereby positing the wrong
    question to the jury in a way that was detrimental to the defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span

    would not give effect to this submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the first place, I do not accept that the impugned passage forms part of
    the trial judge’s charge dealing with the theory of the defence.  Although
    the reporter’s reproduction of the charge indicates no break in the transcript
    at this point, it is clear from a reading of the charge that the trial judge
    had finished his summary of the Crown and defence positions some time prior
    to the passage in question, and had turned to a review of the evidence of
    the defence expert.  He says, “The defence relies upon the evidence of Dr.
    Gourlay, who has experience in treating alcohol and drug addicted persons”.  There
    follows an accurate outline of Dr. Gourlay’s testimony regarding the likelihood
    of a blackout based upon the respective versions of consumption put forward
    by the appellant and the complainant, and a summary of the complainant’s
    position with respect to the blackout.  The trial judge then says, “There’s
    another matter”, and the passage that is attacked follows immediately.  I
    am satisfied that the trial judge’s comments in this connection were not
    made in the context of his summary of the theory of the defence (although
    admittedly they were pertinent to that theory).  Rather, they were made as
    an additional matter to be commented on following his review of Dr. Gourlay’s
    testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the trial judge was simply posing an example to assist the jury
    in its consideration of Dr. Gourlay’s evidence.  He was entitled to do that
    and did not have to accept the defence hypothesis for that purpose.  The
    appellant’s evidence was that he and the complainant were drinking throughout
    the entire period from 5:30 or 6:00 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. (the nine to ten hours
    alluded to by the trial judge); the appellant did not say they consumed all
    six drinks each by 11:30.  Thus, there was a basis for suggesting that the
    drinking continued for a nine to ten hour period, and the trial judge’s example
    of the possible blood alcohol level of the complainant at the time of the
    incident was not faulty in that respect.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that defence counsel may have attempted to frame the issue differently
    for the jury does not make the trial judge’s comment improper.  Defence counsel’s
    hypothesis to the jury was that the complainant went into a blackout at about
    11:30 - 12 midnight and that the discussions about acting out the bondage
    fantasy took place thereafter, during which she consented to the acts that
    took place around 3:30 a.m.; at that time she came out of the blackout and
    protested.  While the trial judge did not put the defence theory to the jury
    in terms of that specific time line, he did squarely put the theory to the
    jury that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[the complainant]
    did not go to sleep, that she entered into a blackout in which she carried
    on normally, engaged in a joking conversation of a sexual nature, and ultimately
    agreed to be tied up, bound with tape and mock raped.  Upon snapping out
    of the blackout, she had no memory of her conversation or agreement and became
    outraged with the situation in which she found herself whereupon she was
    released.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no danger, in my view, that the impugned passage from the trial judge’s
    charge would undermine the jury’s grasp of that defence position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    Mr. Lindsay submits that the trial judge misstated the evidence, and failed
    to refer to evidence that he should have referred to, on the issue of alcohol
    elimination from the blood.  Dr. Gourlay had testified that a person eliminates
    more than one ounce and less than one and one-half ounces of alcohol per
    hour.  But the trial judge telescoped this to “one standard drink an hour,
    and perhaps something less for a woman” in the passage cited above, suggesting
    that the complainant may have eliminated more alcohol at a given point, thus
    making a blackout less likely than indicated by the evidence.  In addition,
    the appellant asserts that the trial judge made no reference at all to the
    expert evidence that it would take only two-thirds of the alcohol for a woman
    to achieve a given blood alcohol level as compared to a man, thus making
    a blackout more likely in the case of the complainant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    the extent that the trial judge’s mathematics may have been affected by his
    reference to a standard drink being one and one-half ounces of alcohol – as
    opposed to the more than one ounce and less than one and one-half ounces
    testified to by Dr. Gourlay – I do not think this seriously overstated the
    amount of alcohol that may have been eliminated from the complainant’s blood
    (thus making a blackout seem less likely).  The trial judge told the jury “the
    body eliminates one standard drink an hour, <i>and perhaps something less
    for a woman</i>”.  This would alert the jury to the possibility that the
    complainant may have eliminated less than one and one-half ounces per hour.  There
    is no risk that the jury was misled by the trial judge’s example, in my opinion.  As
    noted above, this passage in the charge did not form part of the trial judge’s
    outline of the positions of the Crown and defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    was it necessary for the trial judge to allude to Dr. Gourlay’s evidence
    that it would take only two-thirds the amount of alcohol for a woman to achieve
    a given blood alcohol level as compared to a man.  The trial judge told the
    jury elsewhere that an average woman eliminates about two-thirds the amount
    of alcohol that an average man does.  Moreover, the expert had agreed that
    an experienced female drinker could eliminate alcohol as quickly, or perhaps
    more quickly, than an average man.  The complainant was an experienced drinker.  The
    two-thirds alcohol level issue, it seems to me, opens up an entirely different
    area of the evidence for examination.  A trial judge is obliged to be balanced
    and fair, but has no obligation to pursue every piece of evidence that counsel
    may possibly be able to link, directly or indirectly, to any given point.  Had
    the trial judge pursued the “two-thirds” issue, as the appellant urges, he
    would have had to outline all of the foregoing, the end result of which would
    have been no more than neutral for the appellant.  In my view, it was not
    necessary for the trial judge to do so.  </p>

    the end, I am not persuaded that the impugned passage from the trial judge’s
