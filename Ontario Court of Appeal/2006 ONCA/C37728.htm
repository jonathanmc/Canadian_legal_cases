    appellants were tried on an indictment charging that they committed various
    weapons offences and crimes of violence against the two complainants, Brian
    Morrison and Paul Dulmage.  The indictment concerned three separate incidents
    in 1997 involving Morrison and one incident in 1998 involving Dulmage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span

      twelve-count indictment alleged criminal activity by James Zebedee, his
      two sons, Shane and Charles Lang, and two family friends, Jason Brooks
      and Jason Wyse.  </span>Morrison and Dulmage identified their attackers
      as the appellants, people who were well known to them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specifically,
    it was alleged that Zebedee and his family members sold cocaine to Morrison
    and Dulmage and that when they did not honour their debts, the appellants
    assaulted them in an effort to collect on what was owing.  The central issue
    at trial was the credibility of the complainants having regard to their close
    friendship, their extensive criminal backgrounds and their numerous and inconsistent
    prior statements to the police, including initial denials that the appellants
    were responsible for their injuries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morrison
    and Dulmage had been friends since childhood.  Both had extensive criminal
    records, including entries for which they had been convicted as co-perpetrators.  Both
    Morrison and Dulmage purchased drugs from Zebedee and his family members,
    often on credit.  Both alleged that the appellants had assaulted them as
    a means of encouraging repayment of their drug debts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morrison
    alleged that he was assaulted by the appellants in three separate incidents:
    (i) in the summer of 1997, at an apartment on Bleecker Avenue in Belleville,
    Charles Lang and Zebedee beat him with a pipe and pointed a gun at him; (ii)
    on August 18, 1997, at Zebedee’s farm, Wyse and Zebedee shot him with a flare
    gun and a revolver, resulting in his being treated at a hospital for a bullet
    wound; and (iii) on December 18, 1997, at Morrison’s apartment, Shane Lang,
    Charles Lang, Brooks, and another man engaged him in a fistfight and waved
    a knife at him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dulmage
    alleged that late in the evening on February 4, 1998, Brooks and Wyse came
    to an apartment where he was visiting a female friend.  Brooks used a ruse
    to get Dulmage to go to the parking lot.  Once he was outside, Wyse pulled
    a gun on him.  Wyse and Brooks forced Dulmage into the back seat of a taxi.  Dulmage
    was driven to Zebedee’s residence where Shane Lang threw him down the stairs
    into the basement and Zebedee, Lang, Brooks and Wyse kicked, punched and
    beat him with pipes and baseball bats.    </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    two weeks of evidence and two days of deliberations, the jury delivered guilty
    verdicts on all charges against all defendants.  The verdicts in relation
    to counts four and eleven were stayed by the trial judge as a result of the
    rule against multiple convictions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge sentenced Charles Lang to four years imprisonment (which amounted
    to time served in pre-trial custody), Shane Lang and Jason Brooks to twelve
    years, Jason Wyse to fifteen years and James Zebedee to twenty-four years,
    along with an order delaying his eligibility for parole.  </p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND </span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       Morrison</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    the summer of 1997, Morrison had known Zebedee for about eight years.  He
    knew Zebedee to live at
    “the farm” and, between 1992 and 1997, he went to the farm once or twice
    a week to obtain narcotics.  He came to know Zebedee’s wife, his sons, Shane
    and Charles Lang, and his daughter.  Morrison would sometimes pay Zebedee
    or another family member for the narcotics.  Usually, he received the drugs
    on credit and he would pay down the debt over time.  Morrison testified that
    he had known Jason Wyse for ten years.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(a)       The first incident</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morrison
    testified that May or June 1997 was the first time something happened because
    of his failure to pay Zebedee money he was owed.  He was at a tavern and,
    at about 3:00 p.m., was approached by Charles Lang, who told him that his
    father wanted to see him.  Lang said that his father had something for Morrison,
    which Morrison presumed meant drugs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morrison,
    Lang and “a pool player” from the tavern drove to Bleecker Avenue.  He had
    been to an apartment at this address once before with Zebedee and some others.  Zebedee
    slid a gun across the table and Charles Lang grabbed it.  Zebedee then hit
    Morrison with a pipe that was more than a foot long, leaving bruises on his
    forearms, which he had used to block the pipe from hitting his head.  Morrison
    thought he had been hit about ten times.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morrison
    described the gun as a “small gun” and believed that it was a .25 calibre,
    or perhaps a .22.  Lang merely pointed the gun at him while Zebedee hit him
    with the pipe.  Morrison told Zebedee that he would get Zebedee’s money but
    needed time.  Zebedee told him that he had better hurry and continued hitting
    him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the beating, Morrison was driven back downtown to the tavern.  He received
    no medical attention for this assault.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(b)       The second incident</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morrison
    continued to buy drugs from Zebedee and became further indebted to him.  By
    August 18, 1997, he owed about $4,000.  On this occasion, Wyse convinced
    Morrison to leave his apartment on a ruse. Lured inside a car with Wyse and
    another man, Morrison was taken to Zebedee’s farm because, according to Wyse, “the
    man wants to speak to you” and Morrison
    “probably was not going to like it”.  Morrison believed that he was going
    to get a beating. When they arrived at “the farm”, Zebedee came outside and
    told Morrison that he was a “no good”
    and a “piece of shit”, then pulled out a flare gun.  Zebedee fired the gun,
    hitting Morrison on the outside of his knee. The flare then went into the
    grass and the grass ignited.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morrison
    said that after the flare gun, Zebedee pulled out a handgun, which Morrison
    thought was .25 calibre.  Zebedee pointed the gun at Morrison’s knees and “unloaded
    it”.  Morrison said that he “did a lot of dancing” around to avoid being
    shot, and that the shooting continued until no more bullets came out.  He
    was shot once in the left leg.  Zebedee instructed his daughter to take Morrison
    wherever he wanted to go.  Plastic was draped over the seat in the car and
    the daughter drove Morrison back to town.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morrison
    subsequently went to the hospital and obtained treatment.  Morrison originally
    lied to the police about what had happened.  Police Constable Jeffrey Ling,
    who attended at the hospital on August 18, said that Morrison told him that
    he was shot while walking on Dundas Street.  He asked Morrison to accompany
    him to the location where he had been shot, which Morrison did.  P.C. Ling
    was suspicious of Morrison’s account, but Morrison would not recant.  No
    shooting had been reported in the area Morrison showed him.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(c)       The third incident</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 18, 1997, while Morrison was living with his girlfriend, Charles
    Lang, Shane&nbsp;Lang, Brooks and Derek Pang visited him.  They pushed their
    way into the apartment and said that Morrison owed Zebedee $8,000, plus interest.  They
    rummaged through the house, including through Christmas presents under the
    tree.  Shane Lang told Morrison that the money owed was doubled, that they
    wanted $1,000 a month, and that he was going to be beaten regardless.  There
    was also some discussion about taking Morrison “for a ride”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morrison
    suggested that they should “be men about it” and that just one of them should
    beat him up.  Brooks volunteered and the group went outside.  There, Brooks
    swung at Morrison and missed; Morrison swung and hit Brooks, knocking him
    down.  Morrison then ran to a convenience store where he stayed for a while.  He
    then ran back to his apartment building.  The four men followed him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morrison
    testified that Charles Lang had a big butcher knife, which he was waving
    while saying that he would cut Morrison.  The group left, saying “you’re
    going to get yours” to Morrison.  His girlfriend let him back into the building
    and he called the police twenty to thirty minutes later.  One reason for
    calling the police, he said, was that he was “sick of them”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morrison
    testified that he told Sergeant Graham about what had happened to him in
    the three incidents because he had nowhere to go, and that he just wanted
    to get it off his chest so that “if anything ever did happen to me, at least
    he’d know what happened”.  Morrison testified that the next month, in January
    1998, he packed his bags and “left town”.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Dulmage</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of trial, Dulmage was thirty-four years old.  His nickname was “Tiger”.  He
    had lived in Belleville until 1999, at which point he left because of this
    case.  His lifestyle until 1999 had been that of a thief and drug addict
    who used alcohol, marijuana and cocaine.  He stole merchandise and traded
    it for drugs.  He also ran up debts.  He testified that he had so many criminal
    convictions that he could not remember them all.  He said that while he obtained
    cocaine from different places, mostly it was from Zebedee through individuals
    including Wyse, Shane Lang, Charles Lang and Brooks.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    said that he regularly went to a house on Old Cannifton Road or to Zebedee’s
    farm to obtain the cocaine.  He testified that he had no difficulties in
    relation to his debts until he was beaten on February 4, 1998.  At that point,
    he testified that he owed Zebedee about $1,500.  He had previously had debts
    as high as $3,000, which he had paid down by stealing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between
    3:30 and 4:00 a.m. on February 4, Dulmage said that he was in the townhouse
    of his girlfriend when Jason Brooks arrived.  Brooks used a ruse to get Dulmage
    to go to the parking lot.  Once outside, he saw Jason Wyse leaning into a
    cab talking to the driver.  Wyse looked over and said, “You’ve got the fucking
    goof” and pulled a gun from out of his front pants pocket and pointed it
    at Dulmage’s head.  Dulmage described the gun as appearing to be a black
    .32 automatic handgun.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dulmage
    said that he was “forcibly pushed” into the cab where they tried to wrap
    a sweater around his head.  The driver was told to take them to Old Cannifton
    Road and he did so.  In the car ride, he was told that he owed money, that
    he was a “fucking goof” and that he had to sit and shut his mouth.  He struggled,
    but they kept the gun to his head and he stopped yelling.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Michael
    Gervais was working as a taxi cab driver in February 1998.  He testified
    about events during which Jason Wyse, whom he had known for a few years,
    asked him to go to an apartment complex.  Someone got out of the cab and
    said he would be back in five minutes.  Someone then came out, jumped into
    the cab, and the other guys got back in.  Gervais said that it was
    “Tiger” who came out.  He then drove to Old Cannifton Road, dropped them
    at a parking lot, and did not see where they went.  Less than an hour later,
    he picked Jason Wyse up at Old Cannifton Road and drove him downtown.   He
    said that there could have been three people in the cab at the time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gervais
    was a Crown witness.  In the course of his examination in chief, he was declared
    an adverse witness and Crown counsel was permitted to cross-examine him on
    a prior inconsistent statement that he had provided to Sergeant Graham. In
    cross-examination, he acknowledged that from his perspective, “Tiger” had
    been forced into his cab. He also recalled that once “Tiger” was in the cab,
    the two other men covered his head and told him to shut up or they would “cap” him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dulmage
    testified that after being taken into a house on Old Cannifton Road, he was
    grabbed by Shane&nbsp;Lang, who said something about
    “you’ve got the goof”.  Shane then threw him down the stairs to the basement
    and he landed on his shoulder.  He was dragged, kicked and beaten with a
    baseball bat while he thrashed around on the cement floor.   He was then
    dragged to a little room and left there for an hour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dulmage
    said that Zebedee hit his left shin with a steel bar.  Someone else hit his
    right leg, mostly on the shin, with a baseball bat.  Zebedee, Shane Lang,
    Brooks and Wyse all kicked him in his ribs and chest.  Dulmage said that
    he had been hit with the metal bar between ten and twenty times, and with
    the baseball bat about ten times.  He said Wyse held his leg for Zebedee
    to break it.  Dulmage thought that Brooks had hit him ten to fifteen times,

    testified that while he was in the basement, Wyse pulled out the same gun
    as earlier, stuck it to his head, and told him “you’re going to fucking die.  Tell
    the truth”.  Wyse also told him that if he kept his mouth shut, he would
    live through this.  Shane Lang told him that he was no good and that Lang
    should cut his fingers off.   There was a set of hedge trimmers that Lang
    said he would use to cut off Dulmage’s fingers or toes.  They also discussed
    whether they would leave him in the woods or cut a hole in the Bay of Quinte
    for him.</p>

    said that later, Zebedee’s daughter came downstairs and gave him a couple
    of strong pills and a glass of what tasted like vodka.  After that, they
    removed his grey sweatshirt, which was ripped, and put a burgundy t-shirt
    on him.  Wyse took him out the back door and, together with Brooks, dragged
    him to a car.  There was plastic on the seats.  Shane Lang and Wyse drove
    him to Bleecker Avenue, where he was put on the side of the road in a snow
    bank and “told to keep my mouth shut or I’d get killed”.  They said they
    would call an ambulance and told him to “stay solid”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dulmage
    crawled to a house on Bleecker Avenue, and when he received no response to
    his banging on the door, he crawled back to the road where he was met by
    an ambulance and taken to Belleville General Hospital.  He told the police
    that he had been hit by a car and refused to permit Sergeant Graham to take
    his photograph.  His explanation was that he felt “scared for my life, scared
    for my family’s life” and that he had decided that he was not going to say
    what happened and was not going to testify, particularly because Shane&nbsp;Lang
    had told him in the basement that they knew where each of his family members
    lived and that they “would be all hurt”.  Police attended the area where
    Dulmage said he was hit by a car but it revealed no glass or tire marks or
    any other indicators consistent with an automobile accident.  </p>

    was initially treated in the emergency department of Belleville General Hospital.  He
    had a number of lacerations and abrasions to either side of his face, bruising
    over his back, tenderness in the abdominal cavity, and an open wound on the
    right upper leg.   He also had fractured ribs, a hole in his lung, bruising
    over the right knee, and a left lower leg abrasion and contusion.  As well,
    he suffered a fractured knee, and fractures to both his right and left legs.  Dulmage
    refused to allow the police to take photographs of him.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dulmage
    was transferred to Kingston General Hospital, where he was treated.  Dr.&nbsp;Taylor
    said that Dulmage had a punctured right lung and primarily musculoskeletal
    injuries, although he did not require surgery. He suffered from a scalp laceration,
    a couple of lacerations to his right shin that went down to the bone, a fractured
    right kneecap, a fractured lower fibula slightly above the ankle and a fractured
    left fibula just below the knee.  There was a rib fracture on the right side
    and it was the displaced rib that had punctured the lung.  It was Dr. Taylor’s
    expert opinion that the injuries were not consistent with Dulmage having
    been hit by a car. They were, he said, consistent with Dulmage having been
    beaten repeatedly with a blunt object.</p>

    that they were going to take $500 off his debt.  Dulmage said that they gave
    him some flowers and a get-well card.  The flowers were put on the table

    as follows: “Get well soon” from “Honest Jim and Company”.  The name “Honest
    Jim” was a name Dulmage had used to refer to Zebedee.  Subsequently, Graham
    observed Zebedee in a parking lot wearing a shirt to which a white tag appeared
    to be affixed.  The tag said, “Honest Jim”.  As well, in the context of an
    unrelated investigation, police seized several photographs from the residence
    of Jason Wyse’s mother.  These photographs show the flowers in Dulmage’s

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue 1: Did the trial judge
      misdirect the jury on the definition of reasonable doubt?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge made four errors in his instructions
    on reasonable doubt. First, he failed to instruct the jury that a reasonable
    doubt could be derived from a lack of evidence. Second, he erred in using
    the morality-laden phrase “satisfies your conscience” when describing the
    level of certainty needed to convict. Third, he erred in<span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'> telling the jury that
    a reasonable doubt is not a doubt “conjured up in the mind of a timid or
    irresponsible juror to avoid doing [his or her] duty.”
    Fourth, he erred in failing to adequately distinguish the criminal burden
    of proof from the civil burden of proof and in failing to instruct the jury
    that the level of proof required was much closer to absolute certainty than
    to proof on a balance of probabilities.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s instructions on reasonable doubt are set out below. Notably,
    they were preceded by full and complete instructions on the presumption of
    innocence and the burden of proof.  The jury was also told, in no uncertain
    terms, that if at the end of the trial, they had “a reasonable doubt after
    weighing the evidence as a whole as to whether [a particular] accused committed
    the offence with which he [was] charged”, they must give the benefit of that
    doubt to the accused and find him not guilty. The trial judge continued as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As I said, given our human condition it is virtually
    impossible to prove anything with absolute certainty. So the burden which
    is on the Crown is to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. That is
    what the Crown is required to achieve. That term, beyond a reasonable doubt,
    has been used for a very long time. It is part of the history and traditions
    of our system of justice, deeply ingrained in the criminal law. But there
    is no mystical or magical formula of law which defines the term.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I tell you that a reasonable doubt is a real, honest
    doubt. It is not some fanciful, frivolous or imaginary doubt. It must not
    be based on sympathy or prejudice. Such doubt is not one that is conjured
    up in the mind of a timid or irresponsible juror to avoid doing their duty.
    It is a doubt which is based on reason and common sense, and is logically
    derived from the evidence. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When the totality of the evidence that you find
    credible convinces your mind and satisfies your conscience, and you are sure
    of the guilt of any one of the men charged, then you should convict. Proof
    beyond a reasonable doubt has been achieved. But if the totality of the evidence
    falls short of such a persuasion in any way, then proof beyond a reasonable
    doubt has not been achieved and you must acquit. And the belief that an accused
    is probably or likely guilty is not sufficient.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So let me just repeat that. When the totality of
    the evidence that you find credible convinces your mind and satisfies your
    conscience, and you are sure of the guilt of the person charged, you should
    convict. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt had been achieved. But if the totality
    of the evidence falls short of such persuasion in any way, then proof beyond
    a reasonable doubt has not been achieved and you must acquit. And the belief
    that an accused is probably or likely guilty is not sufficient.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    analyzing the alleged errors in that instruction, it is useful to recall
    the test that must be applied in every case in which a trial judge’s instructions
    on reasonable doubt are challenged. It is found at para. 233 of <i>R. v.
    Starr</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A charge must be examined in its entirety to determine
    whether the essential elements of a fair and accurate instruction on reasonable
    doubt are present and have been properly explained. <i>The question in every
    case in which a trial judge’s instructions on reasonable doubt are impugned
    is whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury was under a misapprehension
    as to the correct standard of proof to apply</i> [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    that test in mind, we turn to the alleged errors.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(a)       Lack of evidence
      can give rise to a reasonable doubt</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his instructions, the trial judge failed to tell the jury that a reasonable
    doubt could be derived from a lack of evidence. He should have done so. (See <i>R.
    v. Lifchus</i> (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at paras. 36 and 39.) Lack
    of evidence is a factor that the jury can consider in deciding whether or
    not the Crown has met its burden of proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ideally,
    the “lack of evidence” instruction should be provided explicitly. However,
    when that does not occur, the omission will be harmless if the message is
    otherwise adequately conveyed to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the message was adequately conveyed in two ways. First, the jury
    was repeatedly told that they were to consider the evidence “as a whole” in
    deciding whether the Crown had met its burden of proof. As such, it would
    have been evident to the jury that “gaps and silences in the evidence must
    be factored into their reasonable doubt assessment”. (See <i>R. v. Archer </i>(2005),
    202 C.C.C. (3d) 60 at para. 40 (Ont. C.A.) per Doherty J.A.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in recharging the jury following objections to the charge, the trial judge
    told the jury that in considering the defence position, they could consider
    not only “the many identifiable inconsistencies in the testimony of Messrs.
    Morrison and Dulmage” but also “the lack of confirmatory evidence in some
    areas”. He then provided the jury with several examples of
    “missing” evidence that defence counsel had stressed in their closing addresses
    to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking
    those instructions into account and considering the charge as a whole, we
    have no doubt that the jury would have understood that they could consider
    a lack of evidence in deciding whether the Crown had met its burden of proof.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(b)       “Morality-laden” language</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge used the expression “satisfies your conscience” in describing
    the level of certainty that had to be achieved in order to convict. In light
    of <i>Lifchus, supra</i>, at paras. 26 and 37, morality-laden expressions
    of that nature should be avoided. That said, such expressions are not automatically
    fatal to a charge on reasonable doubt.  Rather, they must be considered in
    the context of the charge as a whole with a view to determining whether they  raise
    a “serious concern about the validity of the jury’s verdict, and lead to
    the conclusion that the accused did not have a fair trial”.  (See <i>R. v.
    Russell</i> (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 66 at para. 23 (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v.
    Pan</i> (2001), 155 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at para. 128 (S.C.C.))</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Pan,
      supra</i>, is of particular significance on the issue of “morality-laden” language.
      In <i>Pan,</i> the learned and experienced trial judge told the jury, among
      other things, that proof beyond a reasonable doubt
    “is that degree of proof which convinces the mind and satisfies the conscience
    so you, as conscientious jurors, feel bound or compelled to act upon it.
    You must be able to say to yourself, ‘He is really guilty. Of that I am morally
    certain.’”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    is apparent, the “morality-laden” language in <i>Pan</i> went much further
    than the language used by the trial judge in this case. And yet, the Supreme
    Court found that the charge in <i>Pan </i>did not cross the <i>Russell</i> line.
    We reach the same conclusion here. When the charge on reasonable doubt is
    read as a whole, we do not believe that the jurors would have viewed the
    reasonable doubt standard as a shifting standard that could move up or down
    depending on their individual consciences. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(c)       The “timid” juror
      instruction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge told the jury that a reasonable doubt was not a doubt “conjured
    up in the mind of a timid or irresponsible juror to avoid doing [his or her]
    duty”. He should have avoided that language. (See <i>R. v. Karthiresu</i> (2000),
    129 O.A.C. 291 at para.&nbsp;8 (C.A.)) Nonetheless, a similar instruction
    was given in <i>Pan</i>, <i>supra</i>, and, as indicated above, the Supreme
    Court found that the charge did not cross the <i>Russell</i> line. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same holds true in this case. The jury deliberated the fate of the appellants
    for the better part of fifteen hours over the course of two days. That hardly
    speaks to a jury that was willing to shirk its responsibilities and defy
    its oath to avoid being labelled “timid”. On the contrary, bearing in mind
    that none of the appellants testified, it attests to a jury who approached
    this case with considerable care and caution. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(d)       Failure to adequately
      distinguish the criminal and civil standards of proof</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge failed to adequately distinguish the
    civil and criminal standards of proof. In particular, they contend that as
    a result of his instructions, the jury would have been left with the erroneous
    impression that the level of proof required did not have to be “much closer
    to absolute certainty” than to proof on a balance of probabilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    submission, which we view as the appellants’ chief complaint, has two components.  First,
    the appellants submit that the instructions on reasonable doubt were facially
    deficient; second, they argue that these deficiencies were aggravated by
    the trial judge’s admonition that the jury was to take the law from him and
    ignore what counsel had said in their closing addresses. (In their closing
    addresses, two of the five defence counsel told the jury that the reasonable
    doubt standard fell much closer to absolute certainty than to proof on a
    balance of probabilities).  We propose to address those complaints in reverse
    order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Commencing
    with the trial judge’s admonition, some background is required to put this
    complaint into its proper perspective.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> At
    the outset of the trial, after the jury had been selected, the trial judge
    provided the jury with some opening instructions. Included in them were instructions
    on the presumption of innocence, the burden of proof and the definition of
    reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the first witness was called, one of the defence counsel raised a concern
    about the trial judge’s instructions on reasonable doubt. In particular,
    he referred the trial judge to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada
    in <i>R. v. Starr, supra, </i>and maintained that in view of that decision,
    it was now incumbent on trial judges to “tell the jury that proof beyond
    a reasonable doubt is, in the words of [the Supreme Court], much closer to
    absolute certainty than to a balance of probabilities”. The trial judge replied
    that he was familiar with <i>Starr</i> but that it was not his intention
    to instruct the jury along the lines requested because “[<i>Starr</i>] goes
    too far and it just confuses juries. It leaves it open for juries to come
    back – how far is, you know, the distance between probability and certainty.
    You and I both know that you can’t draw a line and do that.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then told defence counsel that while the issue could be revisited “in
    the pre-charge conference or discussion that we’ll have”, he had “considered
    very closely the direction in <i>Starr</i>” and he did not “share [counsel’s]
    view that it’s obligatory that I tell the jury what you have suggested”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, as a result of that interchange, defence counsel knew or should have
    known that while the matter could be revisited at a later stage in the trial,
    the trial judge was not about to give the jury the “closer to absolute certainty” instruction
    referred to in <i>Starr</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge was entitled to take the position he did. The issue
    raised by counsel involved a question of law and it was for the trial judge,
    not counsel, to decide the content of his legal instruction on reasonable
    doubt. If it turned out that the trial judge was wrong, he could be corrected
    on appeal. That is basic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    defence counsel did not revisit the matter with the trial judge at the pre-charge
    conference or at any other time. Instead, two of the defence counsel incorporated
    into their closing addresses the language from <i>Starr</i> that the trial
    judge had indicated he was not about to use. They did not seek the trial
    judge’s permission before doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, while defence counsel’s remarks were correct in law, we
    think that they should have sought permission from the trial judge before
    using language that the trial judge felt would only serve to confuse the
    jury.  In that regard, we note that the trial judge was correct in holding
    that the “closer to absolute certainty” language mentioned in <i>Starr</i> is
    not mandatory. (See <i>R. v. Archer, supra,</i> at para. 37.) </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    that background in mind, the trial judge prefaced his instructions on the
    presumption of innocence, the burden of proof and the definition of reasonable
    doubt with the following remarks:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Lastly I want to again, as I did at the outset,
    review the very important legal concepts discussed in my opening remarks,
    namely the presumption of innocence, burden of proof and reasonable doubt.
    These have been offered to you by all counsel – almost all counsel who addressed
    you yesterday. <i>And I tell you now to ignore counsel’s definition of these
    concepts or any words used in their description. This is an area of law,
    and you must accept it as I am about to give it to you</i> [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge’s instruction to
    “ignore” defence counsel’s accurate depiction of the reasonable doubt standard
    was the functional equivalent of telling the jury that what defence counsel
    had said was wrong. As a result, the jury would have been left with the impression
    that the standard of proof to be met need not be closer to absolute certainty
    than to proof on a balance of probabilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to that submission. Admittedly, the impugned instruction
    should have been phrased differently. The trial judge should have told the
    jury to ignore what counsel had said “to the extent that it differed from
    his instructions”. That said, we do not accept that his failure to include
    those additional words would have led the jury to believe that what defence
    counsel had said was “wrong”, as opposed to “less helpful”
    than what they were about to hear from the trial judge. In so concluding,
    we take comfort from the fact that a few pages earlier in the charge, when
    he was explaining to the jury how his role differed from theirs, the trial
    judge stated: “[s]o forget any statements that counsel have made to you about
    the law <i>if they differ from what I am about to tell you</i>” [emphasis
    added]. Importantly, in his instructions on reasonable doubt, while the trial
    judge did not use the same language that the two defence counsel had used
    in defining the reasonable doubt standard, he did not say anything that would
    have led the jury to believe that what defence counsel had said differed
    in any substantial way from what he was telling the jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regardless,
    as pointed out earlier, the ultimate question to be asked in connection with
    this ground of appeal is whether, having regard to what the trial judge actually
    told the jury, there was a reasonable likelihood that the jury did not appreciate
    the correct standard of proof to apply. That brings us to the appellant’s
    first complaint, <i>i.e</i>. that the instruction on reasonable doubt was
    facially deficient and it failed to adequately differentiate between the
    criminal and civil standards of proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    we do not agree. The trial judge told the jury that they could only convict
    a particular accused if they were sure, based on credible evidence that convinced
    their minds, that the accused was guilty. He then directed the jury that
    if the totality of evidence fell “short of such persuasion <i>in any way</i>,
    then proof beyond a reasonable doubt [will] not [have] been achieved and
    you must acquit” [emphasis added]. Finally, he concluded by admonishing the
    jury that probable or likely guilt was not sufficient. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, by telling the jury that probable guilt was insufficient, that
    they could only convict if they were sure of the accused’s guilt based on
    credible evidence that convinced their minds, and that they must acquit if
    the totality of the evidence fell short of such persuasion in any way, we
    are satisfied that the jury would have appreciated the very high standard
    that must be met before a conviction could be registered. Put differently,
    nothing in the charge causes us “serious concern about the validity of the
    jury’s verdict [or] leads us to the conclusion that the [appellants] did
    not have a fair trial.” (See <i>Russell, supra,</i> at para. 23.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, in the future, the trial judge would do well to follow the model instructions
    suggested by Cory J. in <i>Lifchus</i>, with perhaps some augmentation along
    the lines suggested in <i>Starr</i>. There was no excuse for not doing so
    in this case and the charge contained deficiencies that it should not have.
    Quite frankly, post-<i>Lifchus</i> and <i>Starr</i>, we find it remarkable
    that this ground continues to raise its head. There is no reason for this
    and trial judges should take extra care to ensure that their instructions
    on reasonable doubt are not open to the kind of attack brought here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    indictment in this case was a multi-count indictment involving multiple accused.
    The various counts related to four separate incidents, three of which involved
    the complainant Morrison and one the complainant Dulmage. Morrison was not
    involved in the Dulmage incident and Dulmage was not involved in the Morrison
    incidents. In some of the incidents, not all of the appellants were charged;
    in others, they were all charged. The jury of course heard all of the evidence
    as it related to each of the counts, each of the complainants, and each of
    the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his charge, the trial told the jury that apart from one limited exception,
    they were to determine the guilt or innocence of each accused on each count
    solely on the basis of evidence admissible against that accused. As for the
    one exception, he told the jury that they could look at the evidence on the
    various counts to see if it contained similarities on matters such as patterns
    of conduct, motive, and late reporting, and if so, the jury could consider
    those similarities in assessing the overall strength of the Crown’s case
    on any particular count or group of counts. At the same time, the trial judge
    told the jury that they could also consider dissimilarities in the evidence
    and take those into account in assessing what, if any, value the evidence
    on one or more counts had in relation to other counts. Finally, he warned
    the jury that they could not use the similar evidence to show that the accused
    (or any of them) were persons of bad character who deserved to be punished
    or that they were the type of persons likely to commit the crimes with which
    they were charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, we disagree. Stripped to its essentials, what the jury was being
    told was that they could look to the evidence on the various counts to see
    if it established a <i>modus operandi</i> or set of business practices that
    the appellants employed when enforcing and collecting drug debts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the evidence was sufficiently probative to warrant its reception
    for that purpose. The strong limiting instruction given by the trial judge
    ensured that its prejudicial effect would not outweigh its probative value.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,

      fail to provide an adequate <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the appellants took the position that Morrison and Dulmage were thoroughly
    disreputable and that they could not be trusted to tell the truth. In that
    regard, they pointed to the unsavoury background and character of both men,
    the many frailties and inconsistencies in their testimony, the strong motive,
    particularly in the case of Dulmage, for falsely accusing the appellants<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> and
    the lack of confirmatory evidence that should, in some instances, have existed
    if the complainants were telling the truth. In sum, the appellants maintained
    that the evidence of the complainants was fraught with difficulties and that
    it could not be relied upon to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, the trial judge correctly concluded that this was a case
    in which a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning was required. The appellants contend that
    the warning he gave was inadequate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    addressing the adequacy of the warning, it is important to put the appellants’ submission
    into its proper perspective. Unlike the situation in <i>R. v. Brooks</i> (2000),
    141 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.), where a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning, though mandated,
    was not given, the complaint here is that the warning given was not  “strong” enough
    or
    “detailed” enough. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, considerable restraint should be exercised before giving effect
    to a submission of that nature, lest we begin to slip back into the “blind
    and empty formalism” and “ritualistic incantation” that marked the pre-<i>Vetrovec</i> era.
    (See <i>Vetrovec v. The Queen,</i> [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811 at 823.) For trial
    judges of that era who faced the daunting task of crafting instructions that
    did not run afoul of the inflexible rules then in force, <i>Vetrovec</i> was
    like a breath of fresh air. It put a premium on common sense and it recognized
    that juries were intelligent and they could be trusted to do the right thing.
    It sought to simplify an area of the law that had become “unduly and unnecessarily
    complex and technical”. (See <i>Vetrovec, supra,</i> at 830.)  Elaborate
    instruction, the Court said, was not needed. All that was required, in the
    case of some witnesses, was
    “a clear and sharp warning to attract the attention of the juror to the risks
    of adopting, without more, the evidence of the witness.” (See <i>Vetrovec,
    supra</i>, at 831.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Vetrovec</i> provided
    much-needed guidance. It sent a clear message that common sense and the law
    need not be strangers and that the purpose of legal instruction was to educate,
    not complicate.<i> </i> That message is as important today as it was twenty-five
    years ago – perhaps more so. And yet, the appellants’ submissions, if accepted,
    could well start us down a road towards the reintroduction of a set of rules
    and formulas reminiscent of those that existed in the pre-<i>Vetrovec</i> era.  That
    is a disturbing prospect. It should not be permitted to take root. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hence,
    in a case like this, where the issue on appeal is not whether a <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction
    should have been given, but whether the instruction given was adequate, appellate
    courts will not test the adequacy of the instruction against some pre-formulated
    format or prescribed terminology, but will decide whether the instruction,
    read in the context of the case and the rest of the charge, serves the purpose
    intended by a <i>Vetrovec</i> caution.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a> If the instruction meets that criterion,
    there is no misdirection. Trial judges are owed considerable deference in
    determining how best to frame the <i>Vetrovec</i> caution. They are much
    better situated than appellate courts to determine how to provide a particular
    jury with an effective and balanced <i>Vetrovec</i> caution tailored to the
    circumstances of the particular case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, where a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning has been given, appellate intervention
    will be justified only where the appellant can show that in all of the circumstances,
    the warning as framed clearly failed to convey to the jury the appropriate
    degree of caution required for the particular witness or witnesses to whom
    the caution was addressed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    brings us to the case at hand. In his charge, before providing the jury with
    a “formal” <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction, the trial judge drew the jury’s attention
    to the lengthy criminal records of the complainants and he explained how
    those records could be used in assessing the complainants’
    credibility. In that context, he described the complainants as having lived “a
    life of crime” and he told the jury that this was something that they could
    “take … into account in considering whether [the complainants] were credible;
    whether you believe them”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then turned to <i>Vetrovec</i>. He began his instruction by observing
    that in view of the background of the complainants and their prior criminal
    involvement, the jury would, as a matter of “common sense”, want “to look
    at their evidence with <i>great care and caution</i>”
    [emphasis added]. In that regard, he suggested that although it was not
    “absolutely necessary”, the jury might wish to have “some confirmation” of
    their evidence from “somebody or something other than their testimony standing
    alone.” He then reminded the jury of the need to “<i>closely scrutinize</i>”
    the evidence of the complainants in deciding whether the Crown had proved
    its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Thereafter, he repeated his instruction
    that it would not be “unreasonable for [the jury] to seek confirmation from
    other evidence” although such confirmation was not mandatory. Finally, he
    admonished the jury that the “<i>caution</i>” he had just given applied only
    insofar as the jury was inclined to use the complainants’ evidence to convict
    the appellants; it did not apply if their evidence assisted the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge next alerted the jury to aspects of the evidence that might serve
    as “possible confirmation” of the complainants’
    evidence. He introduced this segment of the <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction in
    the following neutral terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You may find there is some evidence that confirms
    or supports parts of Mr. Dulmage or Mr. Morrison’s testimony. It is for you
    to say, and to determine, how such testimony affects whether or how much
    you will believe or rely upon the evidence of the two complainants in arriving
    at your verdicts. The evidence to which I am about to refer illustrates the
    kind of evidence you may find that confirms or supports the Dulmage or Morrison
    accounts. It may help you and it may not. It is for you to say.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge then outlined, in
    point form, without any elaboration, various items of evidence that the jury
    could consider as “possible confirmation”. With that, he completed his <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants complain that the <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction was inadequate for
    three reasons. First, it failed to alert the jury to all of the characteristics
    that called the evidence of the complainants into serious question. Second,
    it was not enough to tell the jury that they should proceed with “great care
    and caution” and “closely scrutinize” the evidence of the complainants before
    acting on it, without more, to convict; the jury should have been told that
    it would be “dangerous” to do so. Third, the instruction left the jury with
    the erroneous impression that confirmatory evidence was more of a luxury
    than a necessity in deciding whether they could act on the evidence of the
    complainants, without more, to convict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beginning
    with the third complaint, we agree that it was unnecessary and unhelpful
    for the trial judge to emphasize that the jury need not find confirmatory
    evidence before acting on the evidence of the complainants to convict. While
    the instruction was legally sound, it bore little relationship to the case
    at hand. And that is precisely why it could not possibly have prejudiced
    the appellants. There was no lack of confirmatory evidence here; if anything,
    there was an abundance of it. And some of it was extremely powerful. Had
    the trial judge chosen to delve into it in detail, he could have done considerable
    damage to the defence position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the case of Dulmage, the taxi driver’s evidence was very damaging.  Standing
    alone, it virtually sealed the appellants’ fate. But it did not stand alone.
    Equally compelling was the evidence surrounding the hospital visit, including
    the get-well card from
    “Honest Jim [Zebedee] and Company”, the picture of the flowers taken in Dulmage’s
    room, and the picture of the appellant Wyse standing outside of the Kingston
    General Hospital. And that is not all. There was the evidence of Dr. Taylor
    confirming that Dulmage’s injuries were consistent with a beating, not a
    car accident, and Morrison’s evidence confirming the “business practices” that
    “Honest Jim and Company” employed to enforce and collect drug debts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for Morrison, in addition to the support emanating from Dulmage’s evidence,
    there was the medical evidence establishing that he had been shot on August
    18, 1997, and the evidence of his complaint to Sergeant Graham on December
    18, 1997, in which he outlined the various incidents of violence perpetrated
    against him. That complaint was highly significant. It rebutted the appellants’ allegation
    that Morrison’s evidence was the product of recent fabrication and it lent
    credence to his testimony. It also left a gaping hole in the appellants’ collusion
    theory, <i>i.e.</i> that Morrison and Dulmage had put their heads together
    and falsely concocted evidence against the appellants for their own personal
    reasons. In that regard, it is noteworthy that Morrison had nothing to gain
    by falsely implicating the appellants; if anything, he stood to lose a good
    deal by putting his own life at risk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the second complaint, <i>i.e.</i> the trial judge should have told the
    jury that absent confirmation, it would be “dangerous” to convict on the
    complainants’ evidence, we see little difference between that warning and
    the one actually given. The trial judge instructed the jury to proceed with “great
    care and caution” and to “closely scrutinize” the evidence of the complainants
    before relying on it, without more, to convict. In the circumstances of this
    case, we view the difference between the two as largely one of semantics.
    The particular wording chosen to caution the jury lies within the discretion
    of the trial judge. So long as the discretion is exercised reasonably, appellate
    courts will not interfere. In our view, the wording chosen by the trial judge
    in the instant case was reasonable. Accordingly, we would not interfere.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the first complaint, <i>i.e.</i> that the jury should have been alerted
    to all of the characteristics that called the evidence of the complainants
    into serious doubt, we acknowledge that the trial judge could have provided
    the jury with more particulars. He could have mentioned the benefit that
    Dulmage and his girlfriend received in respect of their outstanding fraud
    charges; he could have told the jury about the money Dulmage hoped to get
    from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board; he could have alerted the
    jury to the inconsistencies and other frailties in the complainants’ evidence;
    and he could have told the jury to be wary of so-called “reformed” criminals. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Manifestly,
    the trial judge could have mentioned all of those things. The question however,
    is not whether he could have mentioned them, but whether, as a matter of
    law, he was required to do so. In our view, the answer is “No”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was entitled to take a functional approach to the charge. Unlike
    the situation in <i>Sauvé</i>, the characteristics which went unmentioned
    here were not the least bit subtle or esoteric; they were self-evident.  In
    our view, it borders on intellectual snobbery to think that the jury would
    not have been alive to them or appreciated their significance. This is especially
    so when one considers that the charge in this case was preceded by no less
    than five closing addresses in which defence counsel emphasized and re-emphasized
    all of the characteristics that called the complainants’ evidence into doubt.
    In the circumstances, requiring the trial judge to turn over the same factual
    ground that counsel had tilled and re-tilled would result in form triumphing
    over substance. That is precisely the kind of formalism that <i>Vetrovec </i>sought
    to eliminate. We would do well not to resurrect it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the final analysis, we accept that the trial judge could have provided a
    more detailed and forceful <i>Vetrovec </i>warning. Had he done so, however,
    it would have been equally proper for him to stress and embellish the powerful
    body of confirmatory evidence that supported the complainants’
    evidence. In the end, the trial judge chose to take a more measured approach
    to each. He provided the jury with the basic tools that they needed and he
    left the matter to them. While his instructions were by no means a model
    of perfection, they were sufficient in the circumstances. Accordingly, we
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>

    appellants take issue with the second element of the format. The overview
    of the evidence they say, consisted of a summary of the evidence called by
    the Crown in chief and it failed to review the deficiencies and frailties
    exposed by cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants are correct that the overview of the evidence was essentially
    a summary of the evidence led by the Crown in chief. But that is precisely
    what it was meant to be. The trial judge was not, at this juncture, explaining
    the position of the parties. He was merely alerting the jury to the events
    giving rise to the counts under consideration. That would have been apparent
    to the jury. In our view, there was nothing untoward or improper about the
    format used by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second complaint is that the trial judge failed to adequately put the position
    of the appellants to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is true that in the charge proper, the trial judge devoted little time to
    the position of the appellants. He did however, capture the essence of their
    position, <i>i.e.</i> that Morrison and Dulmage were thoroughly disreputable,
    that their evidence was fraught with contradictions and inconsistencies and
    that it could not possibly be relied upon to establish the appellants’ guilt
    beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    objections to the charge, the trial judge re-instructed the jury and he supplemented
    his earlier outline of the defence position. In particular, he highlighted
    some of the more prominent inconsistencies and deficiencies in the testimony
    of the complainants, as requested by the appellants. He also instructed the
    jury on the law of prior inconsistent statements (something he had neglected
    to do in the charge proper) and he alerted the jury to be on the watch for
    deliberate lies on significant matters as they could be “more telling as
    against the witness’ credibility”. That, of course, is the position that
    the appellants were urging in respect of the complainants and the trial judge
    alerted the jury to fruitful areas of their evidence where such inconsistencies
    could be found. Finally, the trial judge instructed the jury on the dangers
    of collusion and the dramatic impact that collusion could have on the testimony
    of the complainants. That was a prominent feature of the appellants’ defence,
    which, through inadvertence, the trial judge had also neglected to bring
    to the jury’s attention in the charge proper. He did so quite forcefully
    in the recharge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering
    the charge and recharge together, we are satisfied that the trial judge adequately
    instructed the jury on the position of the defence. While it is true that
    he could have gone into more detail, he was not obliged to do so in the circumstances
    of this case. There are several factors behind that observation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    although there were five accused and multiple counts, overall, the case was
    not complicated. Essentially it boiled down to the jury’s assessment of the
    complainants’ evidence. There was virtually no technical evidence and what
    little there was was easily understandable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the positions of the Crown and defence were straightforward and uncomplicated.
    Indeed, in the charge proper, the trial judge spent almost as little time
    on the Crown’s position as he did on the defence. The recharge, however,
    was devoted almost entirely to the defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Third,
    this was a case uniquely suited for the jury and we are satisfied that, at
    the end of the day, the jury would have been fully familiar with the position
    of the appellants. In saying this, we recognize that in his charge, the trial
    judge made little use of the summaries prepared by the appellants at his
    request. In response to objections from defence counsel about this, the trial
    judge stated that he found the summaries to be of “very little help”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be
    that as it may, we cannot stress enough the right, if not the duty of trial
    judges to take a functional approach to jury charges. Yes, the trial judge
    could have provided the jury with more details about the defence position,
    but in the face of five “united front” closing addresses by the defence,
    one could be forgiven for asking: “What would have been the point?”  By the
    end of those addresses, we have no doubt that the jury could have rhymed
    off the position of the appellants in their sleep. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, we wish to emphasize that this ground of appeal cannot and should not
    be approached on a “one-size-fits-all” basis. What will be adequate in one
    case may not be in another. Trial judges however, are in the best position
    to gauge how much or how little is required. On appellate review, their assessment
    of the matter should be afforded considerable deference.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>OTHER ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raised four other grounds of appeal against conviction. We did
    not call upon the Crown to respond to them and we propose to address them
    in short order.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       The jury selection
      issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    view of the publicity surrounding this case, the prospective jurors were
    challenged for cause. The appellants complain that within that process, some
    of the triers of fact were not properly instructed about the nature of their
    task or the procedure to be followed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to that argument. The procedure followed by the trial
    judge ensured that each of the triers was aware of the nature of the task
    to be performed and the procedure to be followed. Individual instruction
    may not have been given to every trier but it was not required. (See <i>R.
    v. Douglas</i> (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 583 at paras. 19-22  (C.A.))</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Direction that the
      jury must take as proof a witness’s denial of a suggestion put in cross-examination.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his instructions to the jury on the legal effect of a witness’s denial of
    a suggestion put in cross-examination, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And, on the other hand, keep in mind that counsel’s
    questions do not constitute evidence, as I told you before, unless the witness
    agrees that the question is factually correct. And I warn you of this since
    allegations of misconduct or suggestions about evidentiary matters are easily
    put in cross-examination. <i>In the absence of evidence supporting such an
    allegation or a suggestion, the witness’s denial of the allegation or suggestion
    must be taken as correct</i>. Counsel’s questions or submissions cannot be
    considered evidence; only witnesses can testify [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the appellants point out, the emphasized portion of that instruction is wrong.
    While it is true that unaccepted suggestions put to a witness do not amount
    to evidence, a witness’s denial of a suggestion does not mean that the denial
    must be taken as correct. The jury is entitled to accept all, a part or none
    of a witness’s testimony. (See <i>R. v. Shirley</i> (2002), 155 O.A.C. 210
    at paras. 15-16 (C.A.))</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fortunately,
    in this case, in the paragraph immediately preceding the impugned passage,
    the trial judge told the jury that they were “not obliged to accept any of
    the evidence of a witness just because there is no denial of it by other
    evidence.”
    As well, one page earlier, he told the jury that they could believe all,
    part or none of the evidence given by a witness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, when the impugned passage is read in the context of the
    charge as a whole, we are satisfied that the jury would have known that they
    could accept all, part or none of a witness’s evidence regardless of whether
    it was contradicted by other evidence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       The use of prior
      consistent statements</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    mentioned earlier, in the recharge, the trial judge instructed the jury on
    the law relating to prior inconsistent statements. In the context of that
    instruction, he included the following instruction on prior consistent statements:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Similarly, if the statement, or part of it, is
    consistent with the witness’s testimony, it is admissible only as to the
    witness’s credibility or reliability – nothing else – in the sense that a
    prior consistent statement may be considered as a factor capable of strengthening
    the credibility or reliability of testimony at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is unclear why the trial judge included that instruction in his instructions
    on prior inconsistent statements. The appellants contend that it could only
    have been referable to Morrison’s complaint to the police on December 18,
    1997, following the last of the alleged incidents involving him. To the extent
    that it did relate to that statement, the appellants submit that the charge
    was in error because the December 18 statement could not be used to confirm
    the truth of Morrison’s sworn evidence. (See <i>R. v. J.E.F.</i> (1993),
    85 C.C.C. (3d) 457 (Ont. C.A.))</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, the passage from <i>J.E.F</i>. upon which the appellants rely deals
    with a situation where a prior consistent statement is introduced solely
    as part of the narrative. That is not this case. The appellants alleged collusion
    between Morrison and Dulmage and they claimed that Morrison’s evidence was
    the product of recent fabrication. Morrison’s December 18 statement to the
    police served to rebut both of those suggestions and the jury could have
    been instructed accordingly. As well, the trial judge could have told the
    jury that Morrison’s prior consistent statement was something that they could
    consider in assessing the truth of his testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed
    that way, the instruction about which the appellants complain is benign.
    Had the trial judge fully instructed the jury on the use that could be made
    of Morrison’s December 18 statement, such instruction would have enured to
    the benefit of the Crown.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(4)       Non-disclosure of
      a conversation involving the appellant Wyse</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants were found guilty by the jury on September 22, 2001. Prior to
    the sentence hearing, which was held on October 26, 2001, the Crown produced
    a transcript of a telephone call that had been intercepted on August 11,
    1998, pursuant to a valid wiretap authorization. Through inadvertence, the
    Crown had failed to alert the defence to the call either before or during
    the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    call involved the appellant Wyse and another individual by the name of Jim
    Thompson. In the call, Thompson, who apparently had affiliations with the
    Hells Angels, commented that “the boys are on a collection”. Wyse expressed
    concern that Thompson was trying to get him “clubbed” out and Thompson replied
    that they were not going to do that. Wyse then said: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I, I don’t know how (laughs). I don’t know how
    anybody else’s fuckin club works. But I know in my club we revolve around
    violence … to get our fuckin loot. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the failure of the police to disclose that call deprived
    them of their s. 7 <i>Charter </i>right to make full answer and defence.
    They seek a new trial on that basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, that submission is entirely without merit. Viewed realistically,
    the taped conversation could not possibly have assisted the defence; if anything,
    it provided the Crown with even more ammunition than it already had. In the
    circumstances, there is no reasonable possibility that the inadvertent non-disclosure
    of the telephone call could have affected the fairness of the trial. Had
    it been disclosed, we have no doubt that the outcome would have been precisely
    the same.</p>

    total sentence was twenty-four years.  In our view, the totality of the sentence

  of sentencing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    imposing sentence on Zebedee, the trial Judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In sentencing you, I’m not trying to do a balancing
    act between rehabilitation and deterrence or denunciation of your activity.  The
    only principle of sentencing that applies to you is deterrence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Given
      the nature of the offences, deterrence was indeed an important objective.  However,
      in our view, the facts of this case did not justify a complete disregard
      for the principle of rehabilitation.  Zebedee’s criminal record, while
      lengthy, was almost entirely for non-violent offences.  With one exception,
      the convictions were for crimes that warranted a reformatory sentence.  There
      were two offence-free periods on his record: one between 1976 and 1984,
      and the other between 1986 and 1993.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge did not find that Zebedee was incapable of being rehabilitated.  Indeed,
    his <span
lang=EN-GB>prospects for rehabilitation, while perhaps somewhat remote, do appear
    to exist.  </span>In our view,<span lang=EN-GB> the trial judge imposed an
    overall sentence that crushed any hope of rehabilitation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, the twelve-year sentence for aggravated assault and the ten-year
    sentence for kidnapping in relation to Dulmage were excessive.  Although
    Dulmage’s injuries were serious and he was hospitalized for twelve days,
    the injuries were not life-threatening and do not appear to have caused him
    any long-lasting impact.  </p>

    total sentence for each was twelve years.  In our view, the trial judge failed
    to give adequate consideration to the mitigating factors that applied to
    them.  Moreover, he failed to give adequate consideration to the principle

    trial judge found that Zebedee “was the leader of the gang”, and that he
    had
    “inveigled others – taken others along with [him] in this criminal lifestyle.”  Having
    found that Zebedee exerted influence over them, he should have considered
    this in determining the appropriate sentence to impose on both Lang and Brooks.  This
    fact should have been taken into account as mitigating their sentences.  </p>

    years old and had a young son.</p>

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref2"

      v. Sauvé</i>, (2004), 182 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Ont. C.A.), this court stated
      that a proper <i>Vetrovec</i> warning consists of the following four elements:</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence
    of certain witnesses is identified as requiring special scrutiny;</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The characteristics
    of the witness that bring his or her evidence into serious question are detailed;</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury
    is cautioned that although it is entitled to act on the unconfirmed evidence
    of such a witness, it is dangerous to do so; and</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury
    is cautioned to look for other independent evidence which tends to confirm
    material parts of the evidence of the witness with respect of whom the warning
    has been given. </p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>Those elements ought not to be viewed as though they
    were cast in stone. (See for example <i>R. v. Pollock</i> (2004), 187 C.C.C.
    (3d) 213 (Ont. C.A.), where the <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction was affirmed
    even though the trial judge failed to point to all of the reasons for finding
    the evidence of certain witnesses suspect; see also <i>Sauvé </i>itself,
    where the court observed that there is no particular magic in the use of
    the words
    “danger” or “dangerous”; it is the circumstances of the case that will determine
    the nature and content of the warning.) They merely provide a legal framework
    that trial judges should keep in mind when crafting instructions that are
    designed to meet the particular needs of the case at hand.</p>
</div>
<div id=ftn3>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref3"
name="_ftn3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>  <i>R.
      v.</i> <i>Sauvé, supra</i>, is one of those rare cases where this court
      found that the <i>Vetrovec</i> warning given by the trial judge in relation
      to three principal Crown witnesses, was not strong enough and that the
      jury should have been told that it would be
    “dangerous” to convict on their evidence without more. Importantly, the trial
    judge in <i>Sauvé</i> did not use the strong language used by the trial judge
    in the present case. He merely told the jury that it would be “prudent to
    examine [the evidence of the three witnesses] <i>carefully</i>” and, where
    they considered it advisable, to look for supporting evidence. In concluding
    that the warning was insufficient, this court noted that the suspect witnesses
    were informants who may have had subtle motives for falsely implicating Sauvé and
    subtle means of obtaining information that “could only” have come from him.
    In the circumstances, the court found that it was obligatory for the jury
    to treat their evidence with “the utmost care”. That, of course, is similar
    to the language used by the trial judge in the instant case where he told
    the jury that they were to proceed with “great care and caution” before acting
    on the evidence of the complainants, without more, to convict.</p>
