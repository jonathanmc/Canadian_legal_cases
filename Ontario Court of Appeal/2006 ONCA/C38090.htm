      Justice T. David Marshall of the Superior Court of Justice [then the Ontario
      Court (General Division)], sitting with a jury, dated June&nbsp;28, 1999.</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ROSENBERG J.A.:</span></h4>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principal issue in this appeal from conviction for murder concerns this court’s
    power to dismiss an appeal on the basis that no substantial wrong or miscarriage
    of justice occurred.  Specifically, the question raised is whether this court
    can dismiss an appeal from conviction for murder despite legal errors that
    would affect the validity of a manslaughter verdict.  The appellant defended
    this case primarily on a combination of accident and self-defence.  The principal
    grounds of appeal all concern accident and self-defence as they apply to
    an unintentional killing.  Inasmuch as the jury convicted the appellant of
    murder and thus must have found that the appellant had the intent to kill,
    the Crown argues that any errors could not have occasioned any prejudice
    to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was tried on a charge of second-degree murder before Marshall J.
    and a jury.  He was convicted in June 1999 and sentenced to life imprisonment
    without parole for ten years.  This was the appellant’s second trial.  The
    killing occurred in 1991.  The appellant was convicted in 1992, but this
    court ordered a new trial for reasons reported at (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d)
    559.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    killing arises out of a dispute between the appellant’s son, Clint, and the
    deceased, Corey Bishop.  While there was conflicting evidence about the relationship
    between Clint and the deceased, it would be open to a jury to find that the
    deceased had severely beaten Clint on prior occasions.  On March 31, 1991,
    Clint and the deceased became involved in a further verbal altercation.  The
    evidence shows that they decided to engage in a physical altercation.  For
    the next several hours, Clint and his friends and the deceased and his friends
    drove around in search of a suitable location for this physical battle.  Regrettably,
    Clint’s father, the appellant became involved.  At Clint’s request, the appellant,
    who had been drinking and watching television, agreed to accompany Clint
    and his friends as “back-up”.  He brought a rifle and two ammunition clips
    with him.  At some point, the appellant loaded the weapon with the larger
    of the two clips.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the version most favourable to the appellant, he, Clint and Clint’s friends
    were heading home when they realized the deceased’s group was following them.  The
    car in which the appellant and Clint were travelling stopped, possibly at
    the appellant’s direction.  The appellant jumped out of the car.  He was
    holding the loaded rifle by his side.  Someone (it turned out to be the deceased)
    approached him with a wooden baseball bat raised in his right hand.  The
    appellant raised the rifle up from his side, said “Back off you son of a
    bitch” and pushed the gun at the deceased.  As he pushed the gun at the deceased,
    the appellant felt it go off.  The appellant claimed that he did not pull
    the trigger and he thought the safety was on.  The appellant saw the deceased’s
    friends approaching and so he went back in the car and drove home where he
    waited for the police.  There was expert evidence that with the safety off,
    the rifle had a tendency to accidentally discharge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have said that this was the version most favourable to the appellant.  There
    was a body of evidence upon which the Crown could rely to show that the appellant
    intended to shoot the deceased, that the rifle did not have a tendency to
    accidentally discharge, and that the deceased was unarmed when he was killed.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Appellant’s Defence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was evidence that the appellant had been drinking earlier in the evening.  The
    trial judge put the defences of intoxication as well as provocation to the
    jury.  However, the appellant’s principal defence was a combination of self-defence
    and accident.  In short, his position was that he did not pull the trigger;
    that the gun discharged accidentally when he was using the rifle in self-defence
    to ward off the deceased and repel an apprehended attack by the deceased
    with the baseball bat.  It was never the appellant’s position that he intentionally
    shot the deceased in self-defence.  Rather, he raised the gun and pushed
    the deceased with it, to prevent an attack.  Of course, it would be open
    to the jury to find that the appellant did intentionally pull the trigger,
    in which case they would have to consider whether the intentional use of
    deadly force could be justified in self-defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge never made the real defence position
    clear to the jury.  He submits that when the charge is read as a whole, the
    jury was only given self-defence in the context of an intentional killing,
    not in relation to an unintentional killing.  I largely agree with that submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the appellant was convicted of murder.  The trial judge’s instructions on
    the intent for murder and self-defence as it related to murder were not tainted
    by any legal error.  The jury must have found that the appellant intended
    to kill the deceased or intended to cause bodily harm, which he knew was
    likely to cause death, and was reckless whether death ensued.  Since there
    was only the one shot, the jury could only have arrived at this conclusion
    by finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant intentionally pulled
    the trigger – that his story of an accidental discharge was untrue.    Since
    there were no errors in the jury instructions on self-defence as they relate
    to an intentional killing, it would seem to follow that the appellant suffered
    no legal prejudice from the alleged misdirection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits, however, based on <i>R. v. Gunning</i> (2005), 196 C.C.C.
    (3d) 123 (S.C.C.) and several appellate authorities, that there must be a
    new trial because of the misdirection in relation to self-defence.  To appreciate
    the force of this argument, it is necessary to first outline the errors,
    the charge as it relates to the intent for murder, and then consider the
    application of <i>Gunning</i>.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Errors Relating to Self-defence and Accident</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have indicated, the appellant’s core submission is that the trial judge
    never made it clear that the appellant’s real defence was a combination of
    self-defence and accident based on the theory that the only force the appellant
    intentionally used was the raising of the rifle, pointing it at the deceased
    and pushing him with it.  The appellant highlights a number of parts of the
    charge to the jury that he says contributed to this error. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant raises the way that the trial judge dealt with culpable homicide
    and the requirement of an unlawful act.  The appellant submits that the trial
    judge directed the jury that the unlawful act was the “shooting” and that
    the jury would have little difficulty finding that the deceased died as a
    result of an unlawful act.  Following are two examples:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(1)       In this case <i>it is obvious that the deceased died as a result
      of the shooting which in law is an assault</i>, which is the application
      of force by one person to another without his or her consent. <i>An assault
      is an unlawful act. In this case the killing is admitted, the homicide</i>,
      if you like.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(2)       If you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it was an
    unlawful act of the accused that caused the victim’s death then you must
    acquit the accused altogether by returning a verdict of not guilty.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>You are not
      going to have difficulty with the question of this particular point, that
      is, that the accused has admitted that he held the gun that killed Mr.
      Cory Bishop</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If you find
    that the victim, Mr. Bishop, died as a result of an unlawful act and that
    the accused committed that unlawful act but you are not satisfied beyond
    a reasonable doubt that Mr.&nbsp;Mulligan had the intent required for murder
    then you will find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter,
    subject to what I say about the defence of self-defence. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the effect of these directions was to remove from
    the jury’s consideration the issue of whether the shooting was an unintentional
    act of self-defence and therefore lawful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge isolated accident from self-defence
    and limited accident to lack of intent for murder.   For example, in the
    midst of his instructions on self-defence, the trial judge digressed to give
    this instruction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I am going to
    go into this in great detail. <i>Just so you do not mix this with the defence
    of accident, I am just going to say a word about accident here</i>. We have
    heard evidence of it being an accident and not being an accident – we have
    reviewed that. But there is evidence here, for instance, from the ballistic
    expert that this was an accident, this firing. The accused gave evidence
    himself as I have said before and I will say it again that this was an accident.
    The gun went off without pulling the trigger.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>For our purposes
    an accident is an unintentional or unexpected occurrence that produces injury
    to another person. <i>Therefore, evidence of accident is really evidence
    of a lack of intent by the accused to cause the death</i>. That is just to
    help you with accident.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is the appellant’s submission, with which I agree, that the two defences
    were closely related. The appellant’s defence was that he shot the deceased
    by accident (i.e. without an intent to kill<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>[1]</span></span></a>) while brandishing the rifle in
    self-defence. However, the jury might understand from this direction that
    self-defence only applied to an intentional killing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the trial judge directed the jury on s. 34(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> but
    not s.&nbsp;34(1).  The appellant submits that s. 34(2) is focused on death
    or grievous bodily harm whereas it was the appellant's defence that he did
    not intend to cause death or grievous bodily harm.  Thus, s. 34(1) was the
    more appropriate provision to leave with the jury.  He says that in the circumstances
    of this case it would be more difficult for the appellant to meet the requirements
    of s. 34(2) than s. 34(1).  A comparison of the two subsections illustrates
    the point:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>34. (1) Every
    one who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is justified
    in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to cause
    death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable
    him to defend himself.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(2) Every one
    who is unlawfully assaulted and <i>who causes death or grievous bodily harm</i> in
    repelling the assault is justified if</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(a) he causes it <i>under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous
      bodily harm</i> from the violence with which the assault was originally
      made or with which the assailant pursues his purposes; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>(b) he believes, on reasonable grounds, that he <i>cannot otherwise preserve
      himself from death or grievous bodily harm</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant makes the point that the jury might well find that the appellant
    did not have a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm.  Alternatively,
    the jury might find that the appellant did not reasonably believe that he
    needed to resort to deadly force to preserve himself from death or grievous
    bodily harm. In the result, the appellant would not have been able to meet
    the conditions necessary to support self-defence under subsection (2).  Yet,
    the jury might very well find that threatening the deceased and poking him
    with a gun (but not intending to cause his death or cause him grievous bodily
    harm) was a proportionate response to the threatened assault, within the
    meaning of s. 34(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge exacerbated this problem because,
    when discussing self-defence under s. 34(2), he focused on the shooting rather
    than the threatening or pushing.  For example, the trial judge directed the
    jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>You can ask
    yourself whether a reasonable person in Mr.&nbsp;Mulligan’s situation with
    Mr. Mulligan’s experiences, may also have believed that he could not preserve
    himself <i>otherwise than by shooting</i> Mr. Bishop.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the real issue was not whether the appellant shot
    the deceased out of necessity but whether he brandished the rifle and poked
    the deceased with it to defend himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the appellant submits that when summarizing the defence position, the trial
    judge never made clear how self-defence and accident were related.  Thus,
    as he had when dealing with the applicable legal principles, when he came
    to discuss the defence position, the trial judge compartmentalized self-defence
    and accident.  For example, when discussing accident the trial judge said
    the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Looking on all
    the evidence on accident, the Crown’s position, the defence position, if
    you are left with a reasonable doubt that it was an accident, [defence counsel’s]
    position is that you must be left with a reasonable doubt on the basis of
    the evidence. <i>If you are left with a reasonable doubt as to accident then
    you acquit the accused of murder but find him guilty of manslaughter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    although the trial judge did instruct the jury with respect to s. 37(1),
    in discussing the elements of the s. 37 defence, the trial judge used language
    that the appellant submits would have led the jury to believe the defence
    related to the shooting rather than the threatening and the pushing.  The
    trial judge also misstated the defence position:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>First, s. 37
    applies where the accused used force, where Mr.&nbsp;Mulligan used force.  Force
    simply means physical conduct.  <i>Here the accused admitted the shooting</i> so
    that particular part will not trouble you.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    trial judge a short time later, however, did correct himself:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Assault is defined
    in s. 265 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  You will not have difficulty with

    trial judge never made it clear that the force the appellant was attempting
    to justify under s. 37 was the raising of the gun and the pushing of the
    deceased and not necessarily the shooting.  For example, the trial judge
    said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The third ingredient,
    no more force than necessary.  The third essential ingredient for s. 37 is
    defence of self-defence [<i>sic</i>].  The third ingredient for s. 37 is
    that Mr. Mulligan used no more force than necessary to prevent the assault
    or the repetition of it.  The real issue for this third ingredient is whether
    the force used by Mr. Mulligan was excessive in relation to the type of assault
    or harm it was intended to prevent.  In other words, was the force used by
    Mr. Mulligan proportionate to the harm or potential harm which Mr.&nbsp;Mulligan
    or his son was facing?</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    well, in a passage that is not altogether clear, the trial judge told the
    jury to use their common sense in deciding whether or not the appellant used
    no more force than necessary “subject to what I said about accident”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant points out that this concern was clearly raised in the objections
    by defence counsel to the charge to the jury.  I have reproduced counsel’s
    dialogue with the trial judge in Appendix “A”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not recharge the jury in response to counsel’s objection.  In
    fairness to the trial judge, the import of this objection may have been lost
    because of the response of the trial Crown counsel that there was an agreement
    in pre-charge discussions that the pointing of the rifle was an unlawful
    assault.  Crown counsel’s position was that if this issue was going to be
    re-opened he wanted all the potential underlying unlawful acts, such as pointing
    a firearm, put to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the appellant has pointed to several errors in the charge to the jury, they
    all really come to the same thing; the trial judge failed to adequately explain
    the legal effect of the appellant’s testimony.  I am not satisfied that when
    the charge to jury is looked at as a whole, the jury was left with a sufficient
    understanding of how the facts related to self-defence applied to an unintentional
    killing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the common feature of these alleged errors is that they rest upon the possibility
    that the jury might have had a reasonable doubt that the appellant intended
    to kill the deceased.  For example, the alleged error in failing to leave
    s. 34(1) is of no consequence if this was an intentional killing since s.
    34(1) applies only where the force used “is not intended to cause death or
    grievous bodily harm”.  Similarly, the focus on the shooting as an unlawful
    act only prejudiced the appellant if the jury found that the shooting was
    accidental. That is, the jury might find the appellant guilty of unlawful
    act manslaughter instead of acquitting him, even though he acted in self-defence,
    because the trial judge in effect took that issue away by telling them that
    shooting was an unlawful act.</p>

    issue then becomes whether it is open to reason back from the jury’s murder
    verdict, which necessarily entails a finding that the appellant did not accidentally
    shoot the victim.  This first requires a review of the instructions the jury
    was given about the effect of an accidental shooting.  In my view, while
    the jury might have been somewhat confused about what finding to make if
    they found, or had a reasonable doubt, that the appellant shot the deceased
    accidentally, at the very least they would not have convicted of murder.  A
    few examples from the charge will demonstrate this.</p>

    in his instructions in accordance with <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C.

    the appellant’s evidence or it raised a reasonable doubt he must be found
    not guilty.<a href="#_ftn2"

    course, the core of the appellant’s story, and this was repeated on many

line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in reviewing the position of the defence, the trial judge told the jury that
    the position was that the appellant should be acquitted because he was acting
    in self-defence, alternatively that he did not have the intent for murder
    by reason of provocation, intoxication and accident and could therefore only
    be convicted of manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    in instructing the jury on the law of murder, the trial judge told the jury
    that they could infer the appellant had the requisite intent for murder if “he
    pulled the trigger and shot the victim”.  He then pointed out that while
    the Crown says that the appellant “intended to pull the trigger”, the position
    of the defence was that “the gun went off accidentally”.  He made several
    more references to the contrasting positions while discussing murder; always
    emphasizing the appellant’s evidence was that the gun went off accidentally. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    when discussing self-defence under s. 34(2), the trial judge told the jury
    that this defence was available whether or not the appellant intended to
    cause death or grievous bodily harm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    the trial judge told the jury that a manslaughter verdict was possible though
    self-defence failed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Six,
    in his instructions on accident, the trial judge made it clear that the appellant
    could not be convicted of murder if the jury had a doubt whether the gun
    went off accidentally.  Since those instructions are crucial to this issue
    I set them out below in full:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b><u>ACCIDENT</u></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If it was an
    unlawful act that the accused was doing, if it was an unlawful act that Mr.
    Mulligan was doing on Heximer Street that night, for example – an assault,
    the defence of accident will only reduce the offence of murder to manslaughter.
    The reason for that is that accident, if you find that or have reasonable
    doubt that this was an accident, it goes to the intent required for murder
    and reduces murder to manslaughter. So again, if it was an unlawful act that
    the accused was doing (an assault), the defence of accident will only reduce
    the defence [<i>sic</i> offence] of murder to manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>To put this
      accident in perspective a little bit with self-defence, as I have given
      it to you, in regards to accident, if you were to have a reasonable doubt
      on the defence of self-defence and that the gun went off accidentally,
      you would acquit the accused entirely. If you were to have a reasonable
      doubt on the issue of self-defence, you would acquit the accused entirely.</i> If
      you do not have a reasonable doubt on the defence of self-defence, you
      will still look at the defence of accident, the defence of intoxication
      and the defence of provocation (which I will be going to deal with momentarily)
      in regards to whether he had intent or whether the Crown has proved beyond
      a reasonable doubt that he had the intent necessary for murder, and <i>if
      you have a reasonable doubt that he had the intent necessary for murder
      on the basis of accident, intoxication or provocation and you would find
      him guilty of manslaughter but not guilty of second degree murder</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>So you can really
    look at it in terms of two steps if you like. Has the Crown proven beyond
    a reasonable doubt that this was not self-defence, bearing in mind all the
    evidence? If you decide that the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt
    that this was not self-defence as I have just defined it to you, then you
    go on and look at the situation entirely again and consider accident, provocation,
    intoxication to decide whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt
    that he is not entitled to those defenses. <i>If you are satisfied beyond
    a reasonable doubt that Mr. Root [Crown counsel] has convinced you beyond
    a reasonable doubt that those defences are not open to him, you will not
    acquit him but find him guilty of the lesser included offence of manslaughter
    as opposed to second degree murder</i>. So you can approach it in that way.
    However, you must keep the defenses in mind and all of the evidence in mind
    in your deliberations.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    italicized portions above are the clearest explanation of the legal implication
    of the appellant’s defence and in some respects are arguably unduly favourable
    to the appellant.  As I will explain later, even if the jury found that the
    gun went off accidentally while the appellant was acting in self-defence,
    it would have been open to the jury to find the appellant guilty of manslaughter.  Importantly,
    those passages also direct the jury not to convict of murder if the shooting
    was accidental; that at worst the appellant could only be convicted of manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seven,
    in directing the jury on the defence of intoxication, the trial judge told
    the jury that if they had a reasonable doubt whether the appellant had the
    intent to kill the deceased, they should find him guilty of manslaughter.
    The instruction on intoxication focused on the intent for murder and the
    jury was told to consider all the circumstances in determining whether the
    appellant had the requisite intent for murder. If he did not, the jury was
    told they could only convict of manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in summarizing the defence position, the trial judge referred to the appellant’s
    evidence that he did not pull the trigger and the various other pieces of
    evidence that supported that position, especially the evidence of the firearms
    expert of the rifle’s tendency to discharge accidentally.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    in my view, while the jury might not have fully understood the relationship
    between self-defence and an unintentional killing, they would have understood
    that they could not convict the appellant of murder unless they found he
    had the intent for murder.  On any reasonable view of the facts, the jury
    could not have found that the appellant had the intent for murder unless
    they found that he intentionally shot the deceased.  It would seem, therefore,
    that any errors in the charge with respect to either accident or self-defence
    that depended upon the jury having a doubt as to whether the appellant had
    the intent for murder could not have caused any prejudice to him.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    such circumstances, it would seem that this court could exercise its discretion
    and dismiss the appeal under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code.</i>  The
    appellant submits, however, that it is not open to the court to dismiss the
    appeal in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in <i>Gunning. </i> However,
    before turning to that decision, I want to deal with certain other submissions
    made by Crown counsel as to why the appeal should be dismissed.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Lepofsky argues that the proviso in s.&nbsp;686(1)(b)(iii) applies because,
    in any event, the appellant was not entitled to rely upon self-defence, at
    least not self-defence under s. 34(1), because the appellant was engaged
    in a consensual fight.  He relies upon <i>R. v. Paice</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R.
    339 and, in particular, the passage at para. 20 of that decision:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Section 34(1)
    is only available where the accused is an innocent victim who has been assaulted
    without having provoked the assault.  Where a person willingly engages in
    mutual combat, he cannot later say that he did not provoke the assault…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this submission cannot succeed.  It was never suggested at trial
    that when the appellant confronted the deceased he was engaged in a consensual
    fight and thus the jury was never charged in relation to that issue.  If
    there were to be a new trial in this matter at which the trial judge put
    the s. 34(1) defence to the jury, the trial judge would, of course, have
    to consider the application of <i>Paice.</i>  However, we are in no position
    to make the findings of fact that would be necessary to deprive the appellant
    of the defence on this basis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that the trial judge was right not to leave s. 34(1) because
    s. 34(2) is a broader defence and it is important that the trial judge not
    overcharge the jury in respect to self-defence.  He relies upon this court’s
    decision in <i>R. v. Pintar</i> (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 402.  <i>Pintar</i>,
    applying the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Hebert</i> (1996),
    107 C.C.C. (3d) 42, held that in charging a jury on self-defence the trial
    judge must take a functional approach.  As Moldaver J.A. put it in <i>Pintar </i>at
    p. 414:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[<i>Hebert</i>]
    invites trial judges to take a hard look at the evidence with a view to determining
    the essence of the claim to self-defence and the <i>Code</i> provision(s)
    realistically available to that claim. It advocates a careful and considered
    culling of the self-defence provisions to avoid unnecessary, inappropriate
    and irrelevant legal instruction of a kind that might well divert the jury's
    attention from the real basis upon which the claim to self-defence rests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in this case, if the jury accepted or had a reasonable doubt with respect
    to the appellant’s story of an accidental discharge, the essence of the self-defence
    claim fell not within s. 34(2), but s. 34(1).  Again in <i>Pintar,</i> Moldaver
    J.A. explained that the functional approach does not imply that legitimate
    bases for self-defence can be removed from the jury’s consideration.  As
    he said at p. 416:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Where a particular
    provision affords the accused a wider scope of justification than a companion
    provision, the narrower provision should only be put to the jury if the evidence
    lends an air of reality to the factual underpinnings of that provision, <i>and</i> the
    provision somehow fills a gap unaccounted for in the justification afforded
    by the wider provision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said earlier, the appellant would have a difficult time meeting the
    requirements of s. 34(2).  Thus, s. 34(1) filled a gap “unaccounted for in
    the justification afforded by the wider provision.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is not to say that s. 34(2) should not have been put.  If the jury took the
    view that the appellant intentionally pulled the trigger, the appellant had
    the right to have the jury pass on self-defence in relation to that set of
    facts.  If he intentionally shot the deceased, he could not rely on self-defence
    under s. 34(1) and the judge would, as was done here, have to charge the
    jury on the application of s. 34(2).  There has never been a suggestion that
    there was no air of reality to a s. 34(2) self-defence claim, even though
    the jury found that the appellant intended to shoot the victim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    summarize, nothing in <i>Pintar</i> detracts from what Martin J.A. said in <i>R.
    v. Baxter</i> (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.) at 111: “Where there
    is an issue as to whether the accused intended to cause death or grievous
    bodily harm the trial Judge, notwithstanding death or grievous bodily harm
    has resulted, should instruct the jury with respect to the provisions of
    s. 34(1) and then proceed to s. 34(2) as the applicable provision, in the
    event that the jury is satisfied that the accused intended to cause death
    or grievous bodily harm.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel also suggests that the appellant was not prejudiced by the trial
    judge’s failure to leave s. 34(1) because the jury was charged on s. 37,
    which in some respects is broader than s. 34(1).  He relies upon <i>R. v.
    Grandin</i> (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 408 (B.C.C.A.) where the court held that
    s. 37, unlike s. 34(1), applies even where the assault was provoked by the
    accused and can apply to an intentional killing.  While there is some force
    to this argument, it seems to me that if fails for two reasons.  First, s.
    37 was put to the jury, in part, on the theory that the appellant was defending
    against an attack on his son.  This was an unlikely scenario on the appellant’s
    own story.  As far as he knew, his son was still in the car when the deceased
    confronted him.  More importantly, the instructions on s. 37 were, in part,
    infected with the same error that occurred in relation to s. 34, the failure
    to make clear that the force sought to be justified was not the intentional
    shooting but the use of the gun to threaten or push the deceased.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Lepofsky also points out that defence counsel (not Mr. Norris) did not ask
    for a charge on s. 34(1) and that there was an agreement in unrecorded pre-trial
    discussions that only s. 34(2) and s. 37 would be put.  However, it is also
    apparent that there was real confusion at trial as to what had been agreed
    to in the pre-trial discussions not only on the s. 34(1) issue.  And, in
    his objection, which I have set out in Appendix “A”, defence counsel did
    clearly raise his concern with the trial judge’s failure to relate accident
    to self-defence.  The failure to put s. 34(1) was only one feature of the
    alleged error.  In any event, the appellant’s complaint about not putting
    s. 34(1) to the jury would be of less import if the trial judge had adequately
    stated the defence position in terms of s. 37.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Crown counsel submits that the appellant never was entitled to an acquittal
    even if his combined defence of self-defence and accident was accepted.  He
    points out that when he approached the deceased with a loaded gun in a residential
    street the appellant was at least guilty of several other unlawful acts that
    could not be justified as self-defence, even if the pushing or pointing of
    the gun could be.  In other words, some of these other offences such as careless
    use of a firearm would have led inevitably to a verdict of at least manslaughter.  See <i>R.
    v. Tennant</i> (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 80 (Ont. C.A.) at 96.  While there
    is considerable force to this argument, it does not directly meet the appellant’s
    complaint.  Whether the appellant’s defence would have led to a complete
    acquittal or manslaughter verdict, he was entitled to have the true legal
    effect of his position placed before the jury –
    namely, that by threatening or pushing the deceased with the gun, he was
    acting in self-defence.  Moreover, it was a question for the jury whether
    the other suggested offences, such as careless use of a firearm, were made
    out on the facts.  This clearly follows from <i>R. v. Gunning</i>, as I will
    explain below.</p>

    accidentally while he was gesturing at the victim.  The trial judge left
    only the defences of intoxication and provocation.  He refused to charge
    the jury on the defence of property under s. 41(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and
    directed the jury that, in his handling of the firearm, the accused committed
    the offence of careless use of a firearm.  The Crown relied upon the careless
    use of a firearm as the unlawful act for the purpose of culpable homicide.  The
    Supreme Court of Canada concluded that the trial judge had directed the jury
    as a matter of law that the accused’s actions prior to the discharge of the
    gun constituted an unlawful act.  In the result, there was no possibility
    of the appellant obtaining an acquittal.</p>

line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court found that the trial judge had erred in two respects.  First,
    he erred in failing to direct the jury on the application of the defence
    of property.  While intentionally shooting a trespasser could not be justified
    under s. 41(1), it was possible that the accused could justify the use of
    the firearm under s. 41(1) to merely threaten the victim.  If the jury took
    that view of the evidence and had a reasonable doubt that the accused accidentally
    discharged the rifle, the accused would be entitled to an acquittal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second error concerned careless use of a firearm.  The court held that the
    trial judge had no power to direct the jury as a matter of law that one of
    the elements of the offence was made out.  The trial judge
    “overstepped the proper boundaries of his function” by deciding that the
    underlying offence of careless use of a firearm had been made out.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    in this case, the Crown argued that the errors could not have affected the
    verdict because the jury found that the accused intended to kill the victim.  Speaking
    for the court, Charron J. rejected that argument, at para. 22:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Crown contends,
    and the British Columbia Court of Appeal agreed, that this whole question
    of careless use of a firearm becomes irrelevant because we must take it from
    the verdict of guilty of murder that the jury was convinced that the shooting
    was intentional. I will explain at the outset why I disagree that the appeal
    should be dismissed on that basis. Undoubtedly, a verdict of guilty on the
    murder charge can only rest on a finding that the shooting was intentional. <i>However,
    we do not know what reasoning led the jury to its verdict.</i> What we do
    know, as we shall see, is that these jurors were never told that a person
    is entitled at law to forcibly remove a trespasser from his home, so long
    as he uses no more force than necessary. <i>Rather, they were directed, as
    a matter of law, to base their determination on the critical question of
    intent on the premise that Mr. Gunning's conduct prior and up to the time
    of the shooting was unlawful.</i> <i>In these circumstances, it is my respectful
    view that it would be unsafe to rely on the jury's verdict in this case as
    a basis for dismissing the appeal</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Charron
    J. did not further elaborate on why it would be unsafe to rely on the jury’s
    verdict in that case.  The crucial factor in her decision that the proviso
    could not be applied, despite the murder verdict, must lie in her view that
    the jury was directed “as a matter of law, to base their determination on
    the critical question of intent on the premise that Mr. Gunning's conduct
    prior and up to the time of the shooting was unlawful”.  In other words,
    the finding that Gunning had the intent for murder was tainted by the legal
    errors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are similarities between <i>Gunning</i> and this case.  The appellant submits
    that the trial judge effectively directed the jury as a matter of law that
    culpable homicide was made out by the unlawful act (assault) of shooting.  This
    error, he says, is the equivalent of the error made by the trial judge in <i>Gunning</i> in
    directing the jury that careless use of a firearm was made out.  Further,
    by failing to direct the jury on self-defence under s. 34(1) and failing
    to relate accident to self-defence the trial judge made an error similar
    to the error in <i>Gunning</i> in withdrawing defence of property from the
    jury.  The appellant submits, in effect, that while the trial judge left
    an acquittal open to the jury as a theoretical verdict it was as if he had
    withdrawn acquittal from the jury, given that he never adequately explained
    to them how to reach that verdict, except through the unlikely route of s.
    34(2) based on an intentional shooting. The appellant submits that the jury’s
    verdict cannot be relied upon because, as was said in para. 22 of <i>Gunning</i>, “we
    do not know what reasoning led the jury to its verdict”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    oral argument of this appeal, we gave the parties the opportunity to provide
    further written submissions on the application of the proviso in this case
    and, in particular, the impact of the <i>Gunning</i> decision.  Having considered
    these additional submissions, I am satisfied that <i>Gunning</i> does not
    prevent resort to the proviso in this case.</p>

    Crown counsel points out, there is no indication that the <i>Gunning </i>Court
    intended to overrule its earlier decisions that permit an appellate court
    to reason back from a verdict that is untainted by error.  An important authority
    in that regard is <i>R. v. Haughton</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 516 where the court
    set out this test for applying s.&nbsp;686(1)(b)(iii) at 516-517:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The application
    of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46,
    requires the Court to consider whether a jury properly instructed could,
    acting reasonably, have come to a different conclusion absent the error.
    In applying this test the findings of the jury in the case under appeal may
    be a factor in determining what the hypothetical reasonable jury would have
    done, provided those findings are not tainted by the error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has subsequently relied upon <i>Haughton</i> in self-defence cases.  In <i>R.
    v. Elkins</i> (1995), <span
style='color:#333333'>86 O.A.C. 125</span>,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a> the accused testified that he fired
    his gun in self-defence but without intending to hit the deceased.  This
    court found that the charge to the jury may have left the jury with the erroneous
    impression that s. 34(2) was unavailable in the case of a provoked assault.  Relying
    on <i>Haughton</i> at para. 29, Doherty J.A. held that, “In considering the
    application of the curative proviso, I am entitled to take into consideration
    findings of fact made by the jury to the extent that those findings are unambiguously
    revealed by their verdicts and are not tainted by the error”.  I would adopt
    that test.  The jury findings in this case must be unambiguously revealed
    by the verdict and not tainted by the error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to the correct instructions respecting the intent for murder, the
    jury must have found that the appellant intentionally pulled the trigger.  That
    was the only route to murder in this case.  Even if the jury had been instructed
    that if the appellant accidentally discharged the gun while warding off an
    apprehended attack he could be acquitted if he met the requirements of either
    s. 34(1) or s. 37, they would still have convicted of murder because they
    found that he had the intent for murder.  I have set out at some length the
    trial judge’s directions but of particular importance is the trial judge’s
    direction on accident reproduced at paragraph 35. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    effect of these directions was that if the jury found that the appellant
    accidentally pulled the trigger in circumstances not amounting to self-defence
    he could be found guilty of no greater offence than manslaughter.  Even if
    the jury did not believe it was an accident but found that considering all
    the evidence they had a doubt that the accused had the intent for murder,
    again they could only convict of manslaughter.  Since the jury did convict
    of murder, they must have found that not only did the gun not discharge accidentally
    but that the appellant had the intent for murder.  These findings undermine
    any argument that depends upon the jury entertaining a reasonable doubt that
    the appellant had the intent for murder.  Since the appellant’s submissions
    depend upon this finding, the proviso can be applied.</p>

    and of equal importance, the appellant’s case differs from <i>Gunning</i> in
    one crucial respect.  The trial judge never directed the jury that as a matter
    of law the appellant’s conduct leading up to the killing was unlawful.  It
    seems to me that the contrary direction in <i>Gunning</i> was the most problematic
    for Charron J. in finding that she could not rely on the jury’s verdict of
    murder to dismiss the appeal.  Despite the problematic direction by the trial
    judge in this case that the jury would not have much difficulty with finding
    that the appellant committed an unlawful act, he almost invariably followed
    that up with the caveat that this direction was subject to what he would
    say about accident and/or self-defence.  He repeated this direction three
    times within the space of two and one-half pages when giving his summary
    of the law regarding murder.  I have attached those directions as Appendix “B”.  Further,
    unlike <i>Gunning</i> where the jurors were never told that the accused had
    the right to use force, in this case the jurors were given two routes, s.
    34(2) and s. 37, that would justify the use of force.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>MR. HADFIELD:      Yes,
    just briefly. I am concerned about your direction with respect to the issue
    of accident. I know this is a quagmire and I’m sorry I have to raise it again,
    but Your Honour seemed to suggest that every time you used the “accident”,
    that it went exclusively to the issue of intent. And then what flows from
    that is the manslaughter, murder distinction. But the issue of accident also
    has a second import in this trial and that is whether or not, pursuant to
    either 34 or 37, particularly 37, that force that Mr. Mulligan applied to
    Mr. Bishop was no more than necessary. Because as you will recall, my client’s
    evidence is he pushed him away with the gun. That was the action that he
    took. That was the intentional action that he took in defending himself.
    He pushed Mr. Bishop away from him. Then there was the intervening event,
    the accident with the gun discharging without depressing the trigger. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>THE COURT: What
    was the first accident?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>MR. HADFIELD:
    The first use of the term “accident” of course is the one we were using all
    along. It’s the same accident. I mean, the gun discharging is the accident
    event.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>THE COURT: Right.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>MR. HADFIELD:
    There are two uses. The first use is it reducing murder to manslaughter because
    of the intent issue. But the second one that isn’t clear here, in my respectful
    submission, is that my client has maintained that when he applied the force,
    the intentional force to Mr. Bishop, it was to push him away. That the only
    force that he intended to use on Mr. Bishop in defending himself was pushing
    him away with the object he had in his hand, the gun, and that the intervening
    event, the gun going off, was an accident. But his intention was to apply
    only such force as was reasonably necessary, namely to push Mr. Bishop away
    from him.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The jury has
    to make a determination as to whether or not he used no more force than was
    necessary. My client’s and my position is that he only used a minimal amount
    of force. He pushed him away with the gun. Unfortunately then there was an
    accident that occurred that doesn’t go to the issue of intent.</p>

  <p align=left style='

lang=EN-US>So to summarize the law in regard to murder for you, let me review
      for you the requisites of a charge of second degree murder. If the Crown
      has satisfied you beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim, Mr. Bishop,
      died as a result of an assault, that the accused Mr. Mulligan committed
      the assault upon the deceased and that the accused meant to cause death
      or meant to cause bodily harm that the accused knew was likely to cause
      death and was reckless whether death ensued or not then you will find the
      accused guilty of second degree murder <i>subject to what I will tell you
      about the defenses of self-defence, provocation, intoxication and accident</i>.</span></p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>If you have a reasonable doubt on any of the matters essential to
      a verdict of second degree murder, if you have any reasonable doubt of
      any of those matters essential to a verdict of second degree murder, you
      will find the accused not guilty of second degree murder.</span></p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>If you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it was an
      unlawful act of the accused that caused the victim’s death then you must
      acquit the accused altogether by returning a verdict of not guilty.</span></p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>You are not going to have difficulty with the question of this particular
      point, that is, that the accused has admitted that he held the gun that
      killed Mr. Cory Bishop.</span></p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>If you find that the victim, Mr. Bishop, died as a result of an unlawful
      act and that the accused committed that unlawful act but you are not satisfied
      beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Mulligan had the intent required for
      murder then you will find the accused not guilty of murder but guilty of
      manslaughter, <i>subject to what I say about the defence of self-defence</i>.</span></p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>No intention to kill or cause bodily harm of the nature I have described
      need be proved by the Crown to sustain a verdict of manslaughter. Manslaughter
      is an unintentional killing resulting from an unlawful act. The Crown must
      satisfy you beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused killed Mr. Bishop
      by means of an unlawful act that the accused committed upon him, <i>subject
      to what I will say again about the defenses and especially self-defence</i>.</span></p>
