style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to any of the grounds of appeal raised by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the jury selection issue, the appellant concedes that there was no misconduct
    on the part of the Sheriff that would bring this case within s. 629(1) of
    the <i>Code</i>. The appellant further concedes that there was no prejudice
    to him or misconduct on the part of the Crown. At most, what occurred here
    was an irregularity that s. 670 relieves against. There is no basis for suggesting,
    in the circumstances, that justice was not seen to be done.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to McIntosh’s guilty plea and whether it could be used to discredit
    McIntosh as a prior inconsistent statement, we see no need to finally resolve
    that issue. McIntosh gave evidence at the appellant’s preliminary hearing
    in which he testified that the appellant did act as a lookout. Thus, even
    assuming that the guilty plea could not be used as a prior inconsistent statement,
    its use for that purpose occasioned no harm to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the submission that the trial judge erred in refusing to allow counsel
    to cross examine Mr. McIntosh about being beaten by the police, the trial
    judge quite properly stopped counsel from adducing inadmissible hearsay concerning
    the officer’s reputation. In any event, counsel had cross-examined the witness
    as to whether the officer had done anything to him and therefore, the area
    was already covered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the refusal to allow counsel to cross-examine the witness James
    on the s. 9(2)/<i>KGB voir dire</i>, it was conceded that the sole issue
    on the <i>voir dire</i> was the reliability of the videotape statements.
    On that issue, it was not incumbent on the Crown to call James; the Crown
    simply had to call those witnesses that it was relying upon to establish
    reliability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the issue of the medical records, the records were admitted, they were before
    the jury and the appellant, in our view, suffered no prejudice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    with respect to the alleged improprieties in the Crown’s closing address,
    the trial judge corrected the unfortunate slip concerning counsel’s “knowledge” that
    James had told the police the truth in his video statements. In our view,
    the appellant suffered no prejudice having regard to the trial judge’s curative
    remarks. On the issue of speculation, the Crown’s remark about the synchronization
    of the clocks was nothing more than a common sense inference, given that
    there were two separate stores involved and there was no evidence that the
    stores in question had attempted to synchronize their clocks. The appellant
    abandoned all other grounds of appeal raised in the factum.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
