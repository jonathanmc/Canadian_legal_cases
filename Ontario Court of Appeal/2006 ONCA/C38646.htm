  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Nature of the Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a trial before a judge and jury, the appellant was
    convicted of one count of sexual exploitation in relation to each of K.P. and
    A.P.  He was also convicted of one count
    of sexual assault in relation to A.P. but acquitted of sexual assault in
    relation to K.P.  He has served his
    sentence of 33 months and therefore appeals only his conviction.  Although the trial judge provided her charge
    to the parties beforehand and no objections were raised following the charge,
    the trial judge’s charge to the jury forms the basis for the first three
    grounds of appeal.  Notwithstanding the
    absence of objection, I am of the opinion that the trial judge’s charge to the
    jury reveals two errors.  The trial
    judge failed to provide the jury with a limiting instruction concerning the use
    that could be made of the complainants’ prior consistent statements.  Further, the trial judge failed to caution
    the jury that the complainants’ mother’s belief as to their truthfulness could
    not be used to bolster their credibility.  The combination of these two errors leads me to conclude that a new
    trial must be ordered.  I would not give
    effect to the ground of appeal respecting after&#8209;the&#8209;fact conduct or
    to the submission that the verdicts are unreasonable because they are
    inconsistent.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainants, K.P. and A.P., are twins.  The appellant, J.F., is their
    stepfather.  On September 7, 2000, they
    told their mother that the appellant had sexually assaulted them in the
    past.  They were 19 years old at the
    time of the complaint.  Their mother
    took them to the police station and they reported the matter to the
    police.  On the advice of the police,
    they packed a bag, left their home and went to a nearby motel.  The appellant was arrested on September 8,
    2000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>K.P. reported that she had been sexually abused by the
    appellant over a hundred times but recalled only certain specific events.  She testified that:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>when she was 8 years old, the appellant asked her to
    remove her bathing suit;</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>when she was 15 years old (and residing with her family
    in Scotland), the appellant went to her room and tried to remove her clothes,
    and, on two other occasions, made her touch his penis; and</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>from 1996 to August 2000, on many occasions the
    appellant attempted to have sexual intercourse with her (but was not
    successful) and would instead put his penis in her mouth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.P. reported that the appellant began sexually abusing her
    when she was 16 years old.  Between
    December&nbsp;1996 and January&nbsp;1998, A.P. testified that the appellant
    would climb into bed with her in the morning and touch her breasts and vaginal
    area under her clothing.  A.P. said she
    did not know how many times the appellant assaulted her in this way.  Between January&nbsp;1998 and
    August&nbsp;2000, A.P. testified that the appellant had forced intercourse with
    her.  She said that she could not
    remember how many times or when these incidents occurred.  During re-examination she added another
    instance of abuse to her testimony that had not been mentioned previously.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged with two counts of sexual assault
    and two counts of sexual exploitation.  The appellant’s defence was that the allegations of sexual abuse were
    made up by the complainants to avoid them being evicted from the house and to
    secure the removal of the appellant instead.  On September 5, 2000, the appellant and K.P. argued about K.P.’s
    decision to leave her studies and go work in a factory where her mother was
    employed.  The appellant testified that
    he told K.P. that since she was now working, she should find her own place and
    A.P. might as well go too.  The
    appellant also asserted that the complainants were more physically fit and
    taller than he was, and that he had physical difficulties that would make him
    incapable of doing the acts of which he was accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to the defence suggestion of recent fabrication,
    the Crown called J.P., a co-worker of K.P.’s at McDonald’s.  She testified that on one occasion in the
    spring of 2000 K.P. handed her a note that disclosed that she had to sleep with
    her stepfather if she wanted to go out with a boy. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issues:</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       Did the trial judge err in failing to
    direct the jury as to the relevance and limited use of evidence of prior
    consistent statements? </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is trite law that evidence that a witness made statements
    consistent with her testimony is ordinarily inadmissible because that evidence
    is either self&#8209;serving in that it attempts to bolster the witness’
    credibility or it is hearsay.  Also, the
    repetition of a prior consistent statement may give it false credence: see David
    M. Paciocco &amp; Lee Stuesser, <i>The Law of Evidence</i>, 4th ed. (Toronto:
    Irwin Law, 2005) at 445.  In this case,
    the appellant conceded in oral argument that prior consistent statements made
    by the complainants to their mother were properly admitted under the narrative
    exception to the rule to provide chronological cohesion and background to the
    jury.  The appellant submits, however,
    that the trial judge was obliged to instruct the jury that the statements were
    not admissible for the truth of their contents.  In relation to the evidence of K.P.’s co&#8209;worker, J.P., the
    appellant conceded that the evidence she gave respecting a note K.P. gave her
    was properly admitted to rebut an allegation of recent fabrication and that the
    trial judge correctly told the jury that was the purpose of the evidence.  The appellant submits, however, that the
    trial judge was obliged to further instruct the jury that the contents of the
    note K.P. wrote to J.P. could not be used by them as proof of the sexual abuse
    alleged: <i>R. v. Wait</i> (1994), 69 O.A.C. 63 at 65 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that in these circumstances the trial judge was
    required to give a limiting instruction.  Here, the trial judge, after advising the jury that the note to J.P.
    could be used to rebut the allegation of recent fabrication ought to have
    instructed the jury in accordance with <i>R. v. F. (J.E.) </i>(1993), 85 C.C.C.
    (3d) 457 at 475 (Ont. C.A.): </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he fact that the statements were made is
    admissible to assist the jury as to the sequence of events from the alleged
    offence to the prosecution so that they can understand the conduct of the
    complainant and assess her truthfulness.  However, the jury must be instructed that they are not to look to the
    content of the statements as proof that a crime has been committed.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>See also <i>R. v. Divitaris</i> (2004),
    188 C.C.C. (3d) 390 at 400 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R.
    v. A.(J.)</i> (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 528 at 536 (Ont. C.A.); and <i>Wait</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at 65.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that in this case a limiting instruction
    regarding the use of prior consistent statements was not required.  It is true that there are circumstances
    where a limiting instruction may not be necessary.  For instance, in <i>R. v. Demetrius</i> (2003), 179 C.C.C. (3d)
    26 (Ont. C.A.), Sharpe&nbsp;J.A. stated at para.&nbsp;22 that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[i]t has been held by this court that the usual
    limiting instruction regarding a prior consistent statement may not be
    necessary where the defence itself relies on the prior statement (<i>R. v. S.P.</i> (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 120 (Ont. C.A.) at 129), where it was clear to the jury
    that the prior statement was not offered as proof of the underlying facts (<i>R.
    v. G.M.</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 5007 (QL) (C.A.)), or where the concern about
    self-corroboration is simply not present (<i>R. v. Clark</i> (1995), 87 O.A.C.
    178).</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>See also <i>R. v. Vaniderstine</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 4413 (C.A.); and <i>R.
    v. Wiebe</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 544 (C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree, however, that this is a case where the jury would
    have clearly understood the limited purpose for which the evidence was
    given.  In his closing submissions to
    the jury, Crown counsel referred to the contents of K.P.’s statement in her
    note to J.P. and suggested that the statement “made sense”.  Specifically, he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now [the appellant] confirms in&#8209;chief, he’s
    examined in&#8209;chief, he confirms that [A.P.] had a boyfriend, [K.P.] did
    not.  <i>So does what [K.P.] say when
    she wrote that note to [J.P.], does that make sense?</i>  Well, [A.P.] had intercourse with [the
    appellant] and she had a boyfriend.  [K.P.] didn’t have intercourse and she didn’t [emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>In this excerpt, Crown counsel in effect
    invited the jury to rely on K.P.’s statement for the truth of its
    contents.  Nowhere did the trial judge make  it clear
    to the jury that they could not rely on the note K.P. wrote to J.P. or on
    the prior statements the complainants made to their mother for the truth
    of their contents, and that they were to consider only the fact that these
    statements were made in order to assist them in their understanding of the
    sequence of events from the commission of the alleged offences to the prosecution
    and in their assessment of the complainants’ truthfulness:  see <i>F.&nbsp;(J.E.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 476.  In the circumstances, the jury would not
    have clearly understood that the complainants’ prior consistent statements were
    not being offered as proof of the underlying facts.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Did the trial judge improperly admit the
    evidence of the complainants’ mother regarding her belief that her daughters
    were telling the truth?  If the evidence
    was admissible, should the jury have been cautioned?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In examination&#8209;in&#8209;chief the mother testified that
    one morning after getting ready for work, she came downstairs and found the
    girls at the kitchen table.  K.P. told
    her that their step&#8209;father had been sexually abusing her and A.P.  When asked what she did as a result of the
    conversation with her daughters, the mother testified:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Well, it came as a total shock obviously to be told
    that.  But in the same way, it was
    almost like everything seemed to make sense.  It wasn’t disbelief that I felt.  But, like, I believed them 100&nbsp;% in what they were telling me.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mother’s comment that she believed the girls was
    inadvertently elicited.  Her comment
    offended the rule which prohibits a party from presenting evidence whose only
    purpose is to bolster the credibility of a witness.  It would, in any event, have been obvious to the jury that the
    mother believed the girls from the fact that she took them to the police and
    then to a motel.  The Crown, however,
    pursued the mother’s comment that “everything seemed to make sense” and asked
    her to explain why the allegations of sexual abuse “made sense”.  She replied:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Well, because for so long, as the girls got older,
    the restrictions and everything that he put on them seemed to get worse as they
    got older, instead of them being able to do more things.  I mean, by this time they were 19 and yet,
    you know, they weren’t allowed to go out with their friends.  He had to almost
    take them everywhere they went or – you know, every meal time was line an inquisition.  He would be questioning them about
    everything they did in their day&#8209;to&#8209;day, who they spoke to.  If any phone calls came to the house, he’d
    always question them.  Just, you know,
    to me – like, I often wondered, you know, well, what is the point of all of
    this, because none of it made any sense to me.  But when the girls told me what had been going on, then, like,
    everything seemed to fall into place.  It all made sense, all these things.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that the mother’s evidence was admissible
    because the ongoing dynamic between the appellant and the complainants was a
    recurring issue in the trial and significant evidence was tendered by the
    defence to suggest that the appellant was a loving father figure who wanted
    what was best for them, made sure they had what they needed, and that the
    mother had noticed nothing unusual in the home until the complainants spoke to
    her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mother was entitled to testify as to the restrictions the
    appellant had placed on the complainants and his conduct towards them.  She was not, however, entitled to give her
    opinion as to the inference to be drawn from that conduct as this was the
    function of the triers of fact.  This
    evidence ought not to have been elicited in the way it was.  The references in the evidence on which the
    Crown relies all occurred after the mother had expressed her opinion and may
    fairly be said to be an attempt at damage control.  It is difficult to justify the giving of the mother’s opinion in
    examination&#8209;in&#8209;chief.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the trial judge ought to have reminded the jury
    that it was their role to decide on the credibility of the witnesses and the
    opinion of any witness on the issue of the complainants’ credibility or the
    inferences to be drawn from the evidence was not relevant.  Instead, the trial judge reviewed the
    evidence without comment.  Combined with
    the trial judge’s earlier omission, I am of the opinion that the errors warrant
    a new trial.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       Did the trial judge improperly instruct
    the jury regarding the use of appellant’s after&#8209;the&#8209;fact conduct?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge should not have
    instructed the jury that in the wake of his family’s disappearance on the night
    of September&nbsp;7,&nbsp;2000 the appellant’s changing of the lock on the door
    to the matrimonial home and failure to ask his wife why she left could support
    an inference of guilt.  He submits that
    an inference of guilt from such conduct is so tenuous as to amount to
    speculation.  In the alternative, the
    appellant submits that the trial judge ought to have given a cautionary
    instruction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence in issue should not be considered in isolation.  It was part of a body of circumstantial
    evidence that was properly before the jury.  When the appellant’s family did not return home, the appellant did not
    contact the police or call their workplace or school (although he did try to
    call K.P. and A.P. on their cell phones but did not reach them).  The family had left a full roast in the
    kitchen.  The appellant did call his
    brother but told him that his wife was fine and was out shopping.  When asked why he had changed the lock on
    the door to the house, the appellant said it was because the door was
    jamming.  The appellant also said that
    he came to realize his wife had left him later that night.  The next day, when the appellant noticed his
    wife’s car at a nearby motel, he moved the car to the front of the motel.  He then called his wife’s room and said if
    she wanted the car to come and get it.  He did not ask her for an explanation of her conduct or whether she and
    the children were O.K. </p>

'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taken together with the other evidence outlined above, the
    evidence in issue was properly admissible and was capable of giving rise to an
    inference that the appellant was acting in a manner which, based on human
    experience and logic, was consistent with the conduct of a guilty person and
    inconsistent with the conduct of an innocent person.  The trial judge repeated the Crown’s position that, in acting as
    he did, the appellant knew that “the secret was out.  He hoped that it had not gone any farther than the immediate
    family and he wanted to get control of the family and stop them from going to
    the police.”  The position of the
    defence, which the trial judge also put to the jury after stating the Crown’s
    position, was that the complainants wanted to get the appellant out of the house
    so they could stay there themselves and had colluded and fabricated their
    allegations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the trial
    judge’s charge respecting this evidence constituted an error of law.  The trial judge put both the position of the
    Crown and the position of the defence as to the motive for the appellant’s acts
    to the jury.  The jury also had before
    them the appellant’s explanation for changing the locks.  The trial judge did not tell the jury that
    they could draw an inference that the appellant was guilty based on his
    after-the-fact conduct alone.  The
    charge was adequate and not unfair to the appellant in this regard. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that his acquittal on count&nbsp;#3
    (sexual assault on K.P.) is inconsistent with his conviction on count&nbsp;#4
    (sexual exploitation of K.P.).  The time
    frame for count&nbsp;#3 was December 15, 1996 to August
    31, 2000.  The time frame for
    count&nbsp;#4 was December 15, 1996 to December 3, 1998.  Thus, the time frame on the count for which
    the appellant was convicted is shorter than the one on which he was
    acquitted.  Nonetheless, the appellant
    says the verdicts cannot be reconciled on a rational basis, and the conviction
    on count&nbsp;#3 is unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two predominant differences between sexual
    exploitation and sexual assault.  First,
    absence of consent is an element of sexual assault but not sexual
    exploitation.  Second, sexual
    exploitation requires the accused to be in a position of trust or authority
    towards the complainant or the complainant to be dependent upon him or her
    whereas sexual assault does not.  The
    essential elements and differences between these offences were made clear to
    the jury.  The mere fact that an accused
    is found guilty of either but not both sexual assault and sexual exploitation
    does not mean that the verdicts are inconsistent.  See <i>e.g.</i> <i>R. v. Nelson </i>(1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 150
    (Ont. H.C.J.); <i>R. v. P.S.</i>,<i> </i>[1993] O.J. No. 704 at paras. 26-30
    (Gen. Div.), aff’d [1994] O.J. No. 3775 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was evidence that K.P. fought off the appellant’s
    attempts to have intercourse with her but that she ended up having oral sex
    with him.  The jury came back with a
    question about the elements of sexual exploitation.  While consent was not a live issue at trial, the acquittal could
    mean that the jury nevertheless had a doubt with respect to the issue of
    consent.  As mentioned previously,
    consent is not an element of sexual exploitation.  As the Supreme Court recently stated in <i>R. v. Pittiman</i>,
    [2006] S.C.J. No. 9 at para. 8, the jury’s task is to determine whether the
    Crown has proven each and every element of the offence beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  Where, as here, a single accused
    is charged with multiple offences, different verdicts may be reconcilable on
    the basis that the offences are qualitatively different.  That is the situation here.  Accordingly, I would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons given above, I would allow the appeal, set
    aside the verdicts of guilty and direct a new trial on those counts.  Having regard to the fact that the appellant
    has already served his sentence, however, I leave it to the discretion of the
    Crown to determine whether it is in the interests of justice and the public
    good to proceed.</p>
