  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Michael Bellas, appeals his conviction for
    second-degree murder of Frank Cochrane.  His primary contention is that the trial judge erred by refusing to
    admit evidence of Cochrane’s propensity for violence.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly before 7 p.m. on May 13, 2000, a neighbour observed
    Cochrane just outside the doorway of his apartment wearing pants but no shirt,
    bent over at 90° with blood all over his back and dripping down from the front
    part of his body.  The witness had the
    impression he was pulled back into the apartment.  The witness reported what he saw to the building security guard
    who listened at the door of the apartment ten minutes later and heard
    nothing.  The guard knocked on the door
    without response.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cochrane was found dead in his apartment on the next day.  He had been stabbed over thirty times and
    had suffered injuries consistent with blunt force.  The alcohol concentration in his blood was high.  Several knives and a bloody sledgehammer
    were found in the apartment.  Video
    surveillance captured the appellant re-entering the building shortly after
    leaving with a garbage bag at approximately 8 p.m.  The next day the appellant was seen wearing a pair of gloves, and
    a few days later, a three-inch cut on the back side of his right hand and,
    other cuts on his hands were noticed by the building manager.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When questioned by the police the appellant denied any
    knowledge of Cochrane’s death.  He did
    not testify at trial.  His position at
    trial was that the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he had
    killed Cochrane and he pointed to another person as the potential killer.  On appeal, he does not contest the
    considerable forensic evidence that supports the jury’s conclusion that he
    caused Cochrane’s death. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During his trial, the appellant brought an application to
    introduce evidence of Cochrane’s disposition for deadly violence in order to
    advance a case for self-defence, provocation and/or reduced intent.  The pivotal evidence, in this regard, was
    the transcript of Cochrane’s plea of guilty to manslaughter on April 5,
    1995.  The transcript indicated that on
    the day of the homicide Cochrane had been drinking heavily and ultimately
    stabbed the victim in the chest with a knife inside the victim’s
    apartment.  Cochrane had been the
    aggressor in an ongoing argument earlier that day and had been physically
    separated from the victim by a third-party.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A trial judge has a positive duty to refuse to place before
    the jury a proffered defence that lacks an “air of reality” so as not to
    mislead or divert the jury’s attention from the real issues in the case.  The appellant submits that the trial judge
    committed two errors in arriving in the conclusion that there was no air of
    reality to the issues of self-defence, provocation and reduced intent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant submits the trial judge failed to
    appreciate that the cuts on his hands were defensive wounds.  In this regard, the appellant relies on the
    Crown’s expert witness, who when describing Cochrane’s wounds, testified that
    defensive wounds are often observed on the hands.  The expert was not asked about the nature of the wounds on the
    appellant’s hands, and there was no evidence that every cut on the hands is a
    defensive wound.  Consequently, we do
    not agree that there was on the record evidence that the cuts to the
    appellant's hands were defensive in nature. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant submits that the trial judge
    misapprehended the probative value of the proffered evidence on the premise,
    wrong in law, that the defence of self-defence requires the direct testimony of
    the defendant to establish his state of mind.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the appellant takes remarks made by the trial
    judge out of context.  The trial judge
    made clear he appreciated that the state of mind of the perpetrator required
    for self-defence could be established by circumstantial evidence.  His remarks simply indicate that he
    concluded that the circumstantial evidence in this case was insufficient and
    that direct testimony would be necessary in order to give the defence of
    self-defence an air of reality in this particular case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the trial judge that elements of self-defence
    could not reasonably be inferred from the proffered evidence of Cochrane’s
    propensity to attack neighbours with knives considered with the cuts to the
    appellant’s hands, the general state of the apartment, and the presence of
    knives (none of which, defence counsel at trial conceded, were referable to
    Cochrane).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We arrive at the same conclusion in regard to the appellant’s
    submissions regarding provocation and/or reduced intent.  The proffered evidence, taken together with
    the evidence in the case, was insufficient to give these issues an air of
    reality.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Fresh evidence application</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:
normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant brought an application to produce fresh evidence
    regarding Cochrane’s conviction for manslaughter from the proceedings of his
    preliminary inquiry.  The application
    must be dismissed because the fresh evidence was available at trial and, in any
    event, could not have affected the result.</p>
