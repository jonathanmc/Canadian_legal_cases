    The Oak House Furniture Company, in Ingersoll Ontario.  Terry Plester’s father,
    Norman Plester, operated an antique furniture business under the name of
    The Oak House Importing Company from the premises of the furniture store.  Terry
    and Cecile Plester insured their building and business with Wawanesa Mutual
    Insurance Company (“Wawanesa”).  Norman Plester also insured his business

    its contents were damaged by fire.  Terry and Cecile Plester submitted a
    claim for their losses to Wawanesa, as did Norman Plester.  Wawanesa denied
    each of the claims on the basis that Terry, Cecile or Norman Plester, or
    all of them, set the fire or caused someone to set it on their behalf.  </p>

    commenced an action against Wawanesa in the name of The Oak House Importing
    Company.  Norman Plester died before the case went to trial.  His action
    was continued by his estate.  After a trial of both actions before Justice
    W.A. Jenkins of the Superior Court of Justice and a jury, judgment was rendered
    in favour of the Plesters on January 17, 2005.  Terry and Cecile Plester
    were awarded total damages of $1,000,673.83, which included aggravated and
    punitive damages of $525,000.  The estate of Norman Plester was awarded total
    damages of $131,900 which included punitive damages of $100,000.</p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      and Cecile Plester purchased an historical building in Ingersoll, Ontario
      in 1994.  They restored and renovated the building to make it suitable
      to operate a furniture store.  The store opened in May 1994.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Norman
      Plester, Terry’s father, was engaged in the business of buying and selling
      antiques.  He operated his business from the premises of the furniture
      store.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      March 13, 1997, Terry Plester left the store at 5:30 p.m.  All the doors
      to the store were locked when he left.  Terry and Cecile Plester went to
      bed at approximately 11:30 p.m. or midnight.  There was a bad ice storm
      that night.  At about 2:30 or 3:00 a.m. Terry and Cecile Plester were awakened
      by a telephone call.  They were advised that their store was on fire.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the evening before the fire, Norman Plester was visiting a friend in London
      where he stayed the night.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
      the Ingersoll Fire Department arrived at the store they found that the
      doors were locked.  The only people with keys to the building were Terry,
      Cecile and Norman Plester.  No other person had access to the building.  The
      Fire Chief was unable to determine the cause of the fire and referred the
      matter for investigation to the Fire Marshall’s office.  The Fire Marshall’s
      report stated that the fire was incendiary and was not caused by electrical
      failure.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      Ingersoll Police Force conducted an investigation of the fire and concluded
      that it was a suspicious fire.  No charges were laid by the police in connection
      with the fire.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      retained an electrical and forensic engineer, Cal White, who examined the
      burnt out premises five days after the fire.  He prepared a report in which
      he concluded that the cause of the fire was arson.  His conclusion was
      primarily based on his opinion that there were at least three points of
      origin of the fire.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      also retained the services of a forensic accountant, David Smith, who reported
      that the furniture store business was “doomed to failure” and that it would
      not have survived for more than six months from the date of the fire.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      retained an outside adjuster, Robert Pearson, who took written statements
      from Terry and Cecile Plester on the morning following the fire.  Pearson
      admitted, in his evidence at trial, that he did not find any evidence to
      link the Plesters to the fire.  After the fire, Terry and Cecile Plester
      also gave independent videotaped statements to the Ingersoll police.  </span></p>

      October 23, 1997, Wawanesa sent a letter to Terry and Cecile Plester that
      stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A review of this matter has been
      completed.  The Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company wishes to inform you
      that the claims of The Oak House Furniture Company arising from the fire
      loss of March 14, 1997 are denied.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Trusting that the Wawanesa’s position
      is clear, I remain,</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Yours truly,</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>A similar letter was sent to Norman

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the receipt of these letters, Leonard Croth, a public insurance adjuster
    retained by Terry and Cecile Plester to assist them with their claim against
    Wawanesa, called Robert Pearson.  Pearson suggested that Croth should phone
    Alan Reinhardt, Wawanesa’s chief claims examiner and internal adjuster.  Croth
    called Reinhardt who told Croth that Wawanesa was denying liability.  During
    this conversation, Reinhardt asked Croth if he would be interested in settling
    the claim for fifty percent of the loss.  Croth declined the offer and indicated
    that it was a matter for the lawyer.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      two actions proceeded to trial before a Superior Court judge and jury in
      January and February 2003.  The trial lasted 24 days.  Wawanesa defended
      the actions on the basis that the fire, which caused the losses, was incendiary
      and that the Plesters were responsible.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      order to discharge its burden of establishing arson, Wawanesa called its
      expert, Cal White, and other witnesses.  It also called evidence of financial
      motive through David Smith, its forensic accountant, who, as indicated
      above, testified that the furniture store was doomed to failure.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      response to the evidence led by Wawanesa, counsel for the Plesters led
      expert evidence from Dennis Merkley, who had previously been employed by
      the Fire Marshall’s office for 23 years.  Merkley disagreed with the opinion
      proffered by White, Wawanesa’s expert, that there were distinct points
      of origin of the fire.  He concluded that the fire was of undetermined
      origin since all of the accidental sources had not been eliminated.  It
      was his opinion, contrary to the report of the Fire Marshall’s office,
      that there was evidence that the fire emanated from an area where an electrical
      light timer was located at the front of the building.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      response to the evidence of motive, the Plesters called Ron Smith, a forensic
      accountant.  Smith testified that the Plesters had been meeting all their
      financial obligations for a period of two years before the fire and for
      a period of time after the fire.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      Plesters also called Michael Lavigne, a sales representative of a supplier
      to the furniture store.  Lavigne testified that Terry Plester was paying
      his bills within terms and that he never had to press him for payment.  Three
      months after the fire, Terry Plester spoke to Lavigne about buying more
      stock to continue doing business.  Lavigne was not able to meet his request.</span></p>

      and Cecile Plester testified on their own behalf.  They denied the allegation
      of arson.  Terry Plester testified that, prior to the fire, he was a board
      member of the Chamber of Commerce.  He received the Chamber of Commerce “Business
      Man of the Year” award in 1996.  He was also the treasurer of the local
      Kinsmen Club.  After the fire he was relieved of both positions.</span></p>

      Plester testified that for the financial year ending July 31, 1996 the
      store had a net profit of $5600.00.  However, he projected that sales and
      profits for the 1997 financial year ending July 31 would be much improved.  In
      order to meet his obligations, he cashed in some of his RRSP’s.  He admitted
      that his financial statements were not accurate in that he was pocketing
      about $200 in cash each week and not recording it.  The Plesters had very
      little equity in the building as they had placed three mortgages on it.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      Plesters also called Craig Jones of Key Facts Canada, who had been retained
      by Pearson to prepare a financial motive report.  Jones testified that,
      based on all the sources he contacted, he would classify the Plesters’ credit
      rating as A-1.  He found no motivation to start a fire.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Pearson

      the Plesters called Norman Southwood, the regional vice-president of Wawanesa.  Southwood

      and that the company had assets of over $2,000,000,000.  </span></p>

      for Wawanesa at trial moved for a mistrial after the Plesters’ adjuster,
      Croth, testified that Reinhardt had offered to settle the Plesters’ claim
      for 50 percent.  Counsel submitted that the offer was a without prejudice
      settlement offer and was inadmissible.  The trial judge dismissed the application
      and said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the defendant that
      at the time the conversation took place litigation was at least within
      the contemplation of the parties.  I am not however </span>satisfied<span
lang=EN-US> that the offer was made by Mr. Reinhardt with the implied intention
      that it would not be disclosed in court, since Mr. Reinhardt has not as
      yet given evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In any event, the statement made
      by Mr. Reinhardt, and the circumstances in which it was made, are relevant

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Indeed there may be other evidence

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In any event, it would in my opinion
      be unfair to both parties to declare a mistrial after 11 days of evidence.  This
      is particularly so since, in my view, any harm done to the defendant can
      be rectified at the end of the trial by a limiting instruction to the jury
      advising them of the use that can be made of Mr. Croth’s evidence concerning

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(a) a litigious dispute must be

    the evidence of Reinhardt before his charge to the jury.  Once the unchallenged
    evidence of Reinhardt was received, the three conditions stated in <i>The
    Law of Evidence in Canada </i>were satisfied.  In my view, the jury should
    have been instructed that the offer of settlement was a without prejudice
    communication, and should be disregarded by it as a factor in considering

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Evidence of good character, such

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The fact the respondent's assets of $231 million
    were mentioned to the jury in this case was unhelpful. Pilot was obviously
    a substantial corporation. Disclosure of detailed financial information before
    liability is established may wrongly influence the jury to find liability
    where none exists (i.e., the subliminal message may be &quot;What's a $345,000
    insurance claim to a $231 million company?&quot;). Moreover, pre-trial discovery
    of financial capacity would unnecessarily prolong the pre-trial proceedings
    and prematurely switch the focus from the plaintiff's claim for compensation
    to the defendant's capacity to absorb punishment. In any event, the court
    should hesitate to attribute anthropomorphic qualities to large corporations
    (i.e., the punishment should
    &quot;sting&quot;).</p>

      not appear to have “opened the door” to the issue of financial capacity
      or to have otherwise put the insurer’s financial status directly in issue.  However,
      the cautionary warning by Binnie J. regarding the potential use by the
      jury of this kind of evidence is still apt.  In my view, the evidence should

      there was evidence from the Fire Marshall’s office and the appellant’s
      expert that the fire was incendiary, there was also evidence from the Plesters’ experts
      to the contrary.  Two of the appellant’s own advisors (Pearson and Jones)
      testified that there was no evidence of financial motive to set the fire.  There
      was also much evidence led by counsel for the Plesters that contradicted
      the evidence of financial motive.  Against the appellant’s position that
      the Plesters had the opportunity to set the fire, there was the sworn evidence
      of Terry and Cecile Plester from the witness box that they had not started

      trial judge charged the jury as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Aggravated damages are compensatory
      damages to compensate the plaintiffs for loss.  They are meant to compensate
      the plaintiffs for damages that they have suffered as a result of the actions
      of the defendant.  Typically they are awarded in cases involving reckless
      conduct or intentional wrongdoing on the part of the defendant.  They are
      meant to compensate the plaintiffs for the humiliation, indignity, shame
      and degradation they have suffered as a result of the defendant’s improper
      conduct.  So in order to recover aggravated damages the plaintiffs must
      prove, on a straight balance of probabilities, that they suffered some
      damages as a result of reckless or intentional wrongdoing on the part of
      Wawanesa.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In that regard there is no doubt
      that the allegation of arson would spread quickly through the small community
      of Ingersoll, and raise at least suspicions that the Plesters had something
      to do with the fire that burned their store.  As a result it is clear that
      their reputation has probably been damaged to some extent by the action
      of Wawanesa.  There is however no other evidence before you on which you
      can base an award of aggravated damages.  For instance, there is no evidence
      of illness or emotional distress caused by these allegations, or of an
      inability to obtain employment, or of any other form of discrimination.  There
      simply is no evidence of that.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Indeed, while there was obviously
      damage caused to the Plesters’ reputation, there is simply no evidence
      of the effects of that loss of reputation.  I therefore suggest that while
      it is open to you to award Terry and Cecile Plester aggravated damages
      if Wawanesa has not satisfied you that they were involved in setting this
      fire, it would be unwise for you to award anything more than a modest amount.  I
      say that because there is simply no evidence on which you can base a sizable
      award.</span></p>

      had been relieved of his positions with the Chamber of Commerce and the
      Kinsmen Club.  He also did not mention Terry Plester’s inability to continue
      doing business with one of his suppliers after the fire.  However, apart
      from the aforementioned evidence, the case for aggravated damages was very
      thin.  In the course of the argument before us we were not directed to
      any specific evidence which would support a claim for aggravated damages
      on behalf of Cecile Plester, other than her presumable shame and humiliation
      as a result of the allegation of arson made by Wawanesa.  </span></p>

      of the <i>Trustee</i> <i>Act</i> is remedial legislation and should be
      given a large and liberal interpretation in order to achieve its purpose.
      The language of s. 38(1), in effect, says that the estate of a deceased
      is entitled to recover for all torts or injuries to the person or to property
      as if the deceased were still alive. This language raises the further question
      of whether the Norman Plester Estate action can be said to be an action
      in tort or a claim for injury to the person or to property. While the action
      against the insurance company is originally founded in a contract of insurance,
      there is an independent claim of bad faith. In my view, bad faith claims
      fall into a category of claims for “injuries to the person or to the property
      of the deceased”.  If Norman Plester were still alive, he would be entitled
      to seek an award of punitive damages.</span></p>

      J.A. concluded at paras. 72-74: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The focus of this Act is on the
      estate of the deceased and the damages in an action under the Act are directed
      to form part of the personal estate. The action is “for all loss or damage
      to the person or property of the deceased.” Loss or damage to the personal
      or real property of the deceased caused by a tort or similar wrong must
      necessarily have diminished the deceased’s estate and damages for that
      loss or damage would be recoverable. Loss or damage to the person of the
      deceased is also recoverable where the tort or similar wrong has the effect
      of diminishing the deceased’s estate through, for example, loss of wages
      to the date of death, or costs incurred in medical or other necessary care.
      But loss or damage which does not damage the deceased’s estate such as
      physical disfigurement, pain or suffering, death itself, or loss of expectation
      of life, is excluded. In addition, loss or damage which does not diminish
      the present value of the deceased’s estate, though it may diminish the
      future value, in the nature of expectancy of future earnings, is also excluded.
      From those exclusions the scope of the Act can be determined, as it was
      determined in <i>Campbell v. Read</i>. The damages which may be recovered
      under the <i>Estate Administration Act</i> are the damages that reflect
      a diminution of the personal estate of the deceased, whether they are for
      damage or loss to the person or damage or loss to property, and nothing
      more.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Punitive damages do not fall within

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In some Provinces punitive damages

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[T]here seems no reason why the
      death of the plaintiff should affect an award, for it is not for the plaintiff’s
      benefit that the power to award exemplary damages is supposed to exist … The
      thinking behind the provision that the claim does not survive to the claimant’s
      estate appears to be that the estate should succeed to what represents
      the deceased person’s property and that the deceased can only be said to
      have a property interest in a claim to compensatory damages that replaces
      something of value that has been lost, that is, remedies a depletion of
      the estate for which the defendant is responsible. But this line of thinking
      is really incompatible with the existence of exemplary damages at all,
      for it must be conceded, wherever exemplary damages are awarded to a living
      plaintiff, that they cannot be justified on a compensatory basis. So if
      enrichment of a living plaintiff is tolerable, presumably in the public
      interest, so also should be enrichment of an estate. On the other hand,
      if enrichment of an estate seems anomalous, that must lead the observer
      to question the whole basis of exemplary damages. </span></p>

      access to the building, more likely less than an hour before the fire was
      discovered”.  Counsel for the appellant asserts that based on the report,
      it was reasonable to defend the Plesters’
    claim on the basis of arson. Counsel further asserts that, in these circumstances,
    an insurance company is not required to be correct in making a decision to
    dispute its obligations to pay a claim. A mere denial of a claim that ultimately

      Wawanesa had commenced an investigation regarding the fire, they would

      my view, the appellant’s submissions have merit in respect of some of the
      particulars. The delay of seven months in advising the Plesters that their
      claims were denied is not in itself evidence of bad faith.  The insurance
      company was entitled in the circumstances to conduct an investigation,
      given the information received from both the police and the Fire Marshall’s
      office.  Moreover, I do not regard the proposal to settle the claim at
      fifty percent as evidence of bad faith on the part of the appellant. As
      Reinhardt’s unchallenged testimony indicated, he was simply doing what
      he regularly does in his position as a claims adjuster. Finally, I see
      no basis for asserting that the retainer of counsel in this case could
      be regarded as evidence of bad faith. </span></p>

      I have concluded that some of the particulars relied upon by the jury do
      not constitute evidence of bad faith, there is, in my view, a sufficient
      basis on this record to support the jury’s finding. There is evidence to
      support the jury’s conclusion that Wawanesa’s follow-up investigation was
      not conclusive or complete. The investigation in respect of both the fire
      and financial motive was certainly not conclusive. As a result, I agree
      with the jury that Wawanesa did not produce strong, credible evidence that
      could prove that Terry and Cecile Plester started the fire. </span></p>

      it had to know that it could not succeed in an arson defence against Norman
      Plester, and that the case against Terry and Cecile Plester was a very

      financial status of Wawanesa.  However, I am not satisfied that any substantial
      wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred as a result of the admission
      of that evidence.  Put somewhat differently, on the facts here, the interests
      of justice do not plainly require a new trial: see <i>Landolfi v. Fargione</i>,
      [2006] O.J. No. 1226 (C.A.).  Accordingly, I would decline to order a new
      trial in accordance with s.&nbsp;134(6) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.O.
      1990, c. C.43.  </span></p>

    trial judge awarded Terry and Cecile Plester partial indemnity costs up to
    the date of service of a Rule 49 offer, and full indemnity costs thereafter.  The
    trial judge also awarded a premium of approximately ten percent of their
    costs, in the amount of $30,000.  Terry and Cecile Plester seek leave to
    appeal on the ground that the trial judge failed to order substantial indemnity
    costs throughout.  They also seek leave to appeal the amount of the premium
    and the failure of the trial judge to include in the costs award the fee
    of Leonard Croth and his associate, David Hanson.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    declining to award substantial indemnity costs, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although the actions of Wawanesa were unjustified,
    it should not be penalized a second time with respect to the costs of the
    action.  As a result, I find that the plaintiffs Terry and Cecile Plester
    should be allowed their costs of the action on a partial indemnity basis
    to December 2, 2002 when they served an offer to settle in accordance with
    Rule 49.  Thereafter their costs should be assessed on a substantial indemnity
    basis.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    Mark Orkin, <i>The Law of Costs</i>, looseleaf (Aurora: Canada Law Book,
    2005) at s.&nbsp;219.1.2, the author says:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Some Canadian courts have declined to award both
    punitive damages and solicitor-and-client costs on the reasoning that a party
    who has been punished for misconduct by an award of punitive damages should
    not be further punished by having to pay costs on the higher scale.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The better view appears to be that the two issues
    are legally distinct or, putting it another way, the issue of indemnifying
    a plaintiff for legal costs is sufficiently distinct from punishing a defendant
    for misconduct that an award of punitive damages should not automatically
    preclude the awarding of solicitor-and-client costs.  As has been said in
    this context, the awarding of costs is a discretionary matter which by definition
    is not governed by a set of rigid rules.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    Orkin suggests that the better view is that the two issues of punitive damages
    and solicitor-and-client costs (now substantial indemnity costs) are legally
    distinct, I would not interfere in this case. With respect, it seems to me
    that there are cases where the fact of an award of punitive damages will
    militate against an award of substantial indemnity costs. This appears to
    be such a case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plesters also argue that substantial indemnity costs are warranted because
    of the defence allegation of arson.  The trial judge was alive to this issue.  An
    award of substantial indemnity costs is not automatic even where there are
    allegations of serious wrongdoing.  I am not persuaded that in the circumstances
    of this case the trial judge erred in principle or exercised his discretion
    on an improper basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the premium, the trial judge was clearly in the best position
    (having presided over a five-week trial) to decide the quantum of the premium.
    I would not interfere with his discretionary decision regarding the appropriate
    amount of the premium.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plesters also seek leave to appeal the refusal of the trial judge to allow,
    as a disbursement, the fee of $60,040 for the National Fire Adjustment Company,
    who provided the services of Croth and Hanson to the Plesters.  The trial
    judge held that Croth and Hanson were not expert witnesses and they were
    therefore not entitled to expert witness fees.  The trial judge held that
    the $60,040 should have been included as an item of special damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plesters made a subsequent application to have the National Fire Adjustment
    fee added to the special damages and included in the final judgment.  The
    trial judge dismissed the application, given that this fee had not been placed
    before the jury and the amount of the fee was challenged by counsel for Wawanesa.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Croth
    was not qualified as an expert witness at trial.  However, the trial judge
    apparently overlooked the fact that Hanson was qualified at trial as an expert
    in building contracting and estimating.  In my view, the Plesters are entitled
    to claim an expert witness fee for the services rendered by Hanson.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    the quantum of the fee for Hanson presents a problem.  The National Fire
    Adjustment Company did not produce a detailed invoice breaking down the services
    rendered.  Its bill of $60,040 (which includes the services of both Croth
    and Hanson) is based on a percentage (six percent) of the Plesters’ total
    recovery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    approach would be to send the matter back to the trial judge for his reconsideration.  However,
    this would add increased cost to what is already very expensive litigation.  In
    my view, it would be preferable for this court to deal with the issue.  I
    propose to follow this course.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hanson
    is an estimator.  He offered an opinion in respect of the cost of repairs
    to the building.  His estimate of the cost of repairs was $330,550.47.  As
    previously stated, judgment in respect of this item of damages was given
    in the amount of $319,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hanson
    testified that, with traveling time, he spent two days at the site of the
    fire.  He then spent another day or day and a half preparing his estimate.  In
    my view, a reasonable fee for these services would be $3,000 a day or $10,500.  I
    would allow an additional $3,000 for preparation of his evidence at trial
    and his attendance at trial, for a total of $13,500.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the balance of the fee claimed for the services of National Fire
    Adjustment, I see no error in the refusal of the trial judge to include the
    disbursement in the award of costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, I would allow the application for leave to cross-appeal the costs
    award and allow the cross-appeal in respect of the disbursement to the extent
    of $13,500.  In respect of the claim for substantial indemnity costs throughout
    and the premium, I would dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[123]<span
