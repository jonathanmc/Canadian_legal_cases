  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment
      of Justice William A. Jenkins of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting
      with a jury, dated January 17, 2005.</span></h4>
  <h4 align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><u><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court released its reasons for judgment in this matter on May 31, 2006.  After
    the release of those reasons, counsel brought to our attention that we had
    overlooked the fact that counsel had agreed that the trial judge had erred
    in computing the damages owing to Terry and Cecile Plester.  The trial judge
    had apparently failed to give consideration to certain amounts that Wawanesa
    had paid to the Plesters’ mortgagees following the fire.  Our reasons should
    therefore be amended to the effect that the amount owing to the Plesters
    for the damages to the building should be reduced by $152,262.67.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    have also been advised, since the release of our reasons, that counsel for
    Terry and Cecile Plester seek prejudgment interest on the award of aggravated
    damages.  The trial judge awarded aggravated damages of $175,000 in accordance
    with the verdict of the jury.  Counsel for the Plesters did not seek prejudgment
    interest on that award and he concedes that at the time he did not think
    such prejudgment interest was available.  Further, counsel for the Plesters
    did not cross-appeal on the issue of prejudgment interest on the aggravated
    damages.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this court, we allowed the appeal of Wawanesa, in part, by reducing the award
    of aggravated damages to $50,000.  Counsel for the Plesters now seeks prejudgment
    interest on the aggravated damages of $50,000 on the basis that such damages
    are compensatory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Wawanesa makes three submissions on the issue of prejudgment interest
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)        Counsel for the Plesters sought prejudgment
    interest only on the amounts awarded by the jury for building loss, contents
    and business interruption.  No request was made for prejudgment interest
    on aggravated or punitive damages.  Counsel for Wawanesa asserts that the
    Plesters got exactly what they asked for.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)       Counsel for the Plesters did not raise
    the issue of prejudgment interest on the aggravated damages by way of cross-appeal.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)     Section 128 (4)(a) of the <i>Courts of
      Justice Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, C. 43 provides that prejudgment interest is
      not to be awarded on exemplary or punitive damages. Counsel for Wawanesa
      submits that while aggravated damages are compensatory in part, they are
      exemplary as well and hence do not attract prejudgment interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing
    with the third issue first, the weight of authority is to the effect that
    exemplary and punitive damages are one and the same thing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Denison
      v. Fawcett</i>, [1958] O.R. 312 at 325, relied upon by counsel for Wawanesa,
      this court appears to treat punitive and aggravated damages as the same.  However,
      we note that in <i>Vorvis v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia</i>,
      [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1085 at 1099 the Supreme Court made clear the distinction
      between punitive and aggravated damages:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Before dealing with the question of punitive damages,
    it will be well to make clear the distinction between punitive and aggravated
    damages, for in the argument before us and in some of the materials filed
    there appeared some confusion as to the distinction.  Punitive damages, as
    the name would indicate, are designed to punish.  In this, they constitute
    an exception to the general common law rule that damages are designed to
    compensate the injured, not to punish the wrong-doer.  Aggravated damages
    will frequently cover conduct which could also be the subject of punitive
    damages, but the role of aggravated damages remains compensatory.  The distinction
    is clearly set out in Waddams, <i>The Law of Damages</i> (2nd ed. 1983),
    at p. 562, para 979, in these words:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>…The expression “aggravated damages”, though
    it has sometimes been used interchangeably with punitive or exemplary damages,
    has more frequently in recent times been contrasted with exemplary damages.  In
    this contrasting sense, aggravated damages describes an award that aims at
    compensation, but takes full account of the intangible injuries, such as
    distress and humiliation, that may have been caused by the defendant’s insulting
    behaviour.  The expressions vindictive, penal and retributory have dropped
    out of common use. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear that aggravated damages are compensatory.  Ordinarily, one would
    expect that the Plesters would be granted prejudgment interest on the award
    of aggravated damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in respect of the first two issues raised by counsel for Wawanesa, we are
    concerned that counsel for the Plesters has raised this issue of prejudgment
    interest at such a late stage in the proceedings.  Finality to litigation
    between parties to a lawsuit has always been recognized as one of the hallmarks
    of a just result.  There is nothing to be gained by dragging out litigation
    in a series of interminable procedures.  Therefore, in the circumstances
    of this case, we dismiss the application for prejudgment interest on the
    aggravated damages.</p>
