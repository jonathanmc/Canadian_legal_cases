style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals the trial judge’s decision to admit evidence discovered
    in a search following his arrest.  The central issues are the constitutionality
    of the appellant’s detention and arrest.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    officers, while on patrol, saw Burke riding an inappropriately sized bicycle
    on the sidewalk.  They decided to follow him to see what he was up to.  They
    observed him speaking to two other individuals in the Jane Finch Corridor.  Burke
    and the other two men fled when they saw the police.  He rode across an intersection
    against a red light.  The police followed Burke into the lobby of an apartment
    complex.  They questioned him there and the interaction between them was
    captured on videotape although there was no sound.  A police officer was
    on each side, and quite close to, the appellant.  As part of their questioning,
    the police asked Burke if he had any outstanding charges.  He admitted that
    he was before the court on cocaine charges.  The officer then spotted what
    was confirmed to be a cell phone.  When asked if it was a cell phone, Burke
    replied that it was a cell phone, but it wasn’t his coat.  The police officers
    arrested Burke for failing to comply with the terms of his recognizance.  One
    of the officers, Officer Cecile, believed that the appellant’s answer was
    evasive and an attempt to distance himself from the cell phone.  It was his
    experience that a condition of bail in narcotics cases is that possession
    of cell phones is prohibited.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    pat down search following his arrest revealed a loaded .45-calibre handgun,
    a magazine with bullets, bullets, a small amount of crack cocaine and a “tear-away
    business card”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the defence turned exclusively on a <i>voir dire</i> concerning the
    admissibility of the evidence found from the search incidental to the arrest.  The
    trial judge found that the questioning by police did not constitute an unlawful
    detention and, while the arrest was executed without a warrant, the possession
    of a cell phone with a possible ban, and the appellant’s answer to the police
    officers’
    questions, provided a reasonable basis for the arrest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    the search and seizure were pursuant to the common law right incidental to
    arrest and he held there was no <i>Charter</i> breach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the question of whether to exclude the evidence under s. 24 if there had
    been a <i>Charter </i>breach, the trial judge found that the officers were
    acting in good faith in the honest belief that they had grounds for arrest.  The
    evidence was non&#8209;conscriptive.  He concluded that its exclusion, rather
    than its inclusion, would bring the administration into disrepute.  He came
    to this conclusion by: living in Toronto, reading the newspapers, by watching
    televised community meetings of residents in the very neighbourhood where
    Burke was arrested and watching the pleas of the mothers who lost their sons
    in gun fire.  Thus, if there was a <i>Charter </i>breach, he would have only
    excluded the tear away business card.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Burke
    has served his sentence and appeals against his conviction alone.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits the trial judge erred by finding that Burke was not detained
    until arrested.  Objectively, the appellant submits that he was stopped in
    part for violating the <i>Highway Traffic Act </i>because he was riding his
    bike on the sidewalk and crossed the street diagonally on a red light.  The
    appellant says that he was required under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> to
    answer the initial questions about identity.  In addition the appellant submits
    that he was restricted in movement by the positioning of the officers.  He
    was never told that he was free to leave.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant acknowledges that there was no physical detention.  The issue is
    whether there was a psychological detention.  The appellant did not testify
    at his trial that he felt subjectively detained or compelled to answer.  The
    appellant’s counsel submits that, notwithstanding this, the trial judge erred
    in not drawing the inference that the appellant was detained.  He submits
    that the reasonable conclusion would be that the appellant is being required
    by a police officer to remain.  The appellant relies on <i>R. v. Ferdinand</i> [2004],
    O.J. No. 3209 at para 43 in support of his position.  <i>Ferdinand</i> is
    distinguishable because, unlike the present case the appellant and two of
    his friends testified that they felt detained. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    appreciate, as did the trial judge, that the fact an accused does not testify
    is not definitive of whether there has been a detention and that the surrounding
    circumstances must be considered.  The trial judge chose not to draw the
    inference submitted and we cannot say that he erred in principle in not doing
    so.  The detention was not arbitrary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the issue of whether the trial judge erred in concluding the appellant’s
    arrest was lawful, the Crown concedes that the trial judge stated the legal
    test incorrectly but says that his findings are nevertheless entitled to
    deference.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question of whether there were reasonable and probable grounds to arrest
    is a close one.  The appellant concedes that the police subjectively believed
    that they had grounds to arrest him.  The issue is the objective grounds.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    or not the police had grounds to lawfully arrest the appellant, we are of
    the opinion that the evidence was admissible pursuant to s. 24(2).  The officers
    acted in good faith.  The arrest was not arbitrary.  The gun could have been
    found pursuant to a patdown officer safety search pursuant to a lawful detention
    and therefore the fairness of the trial was not affected.  The search was
    minimally intrusive and, although some force was used in effecting the arrest,
    it was after the gun was discovered and it appears that the amount of force
    involved was inadvertent.  There is no evidence that the appellant was injured.  The
    offences in question are serious. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not interfere with the trial judge’s exercise of discretion in admitting
    the evidence under s.&nbsp;24(2) in the event that there were no reasonable
    probable grounds to arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly
    the appeal is dismissed.</p>
