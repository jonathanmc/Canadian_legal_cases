  <p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Paul U. Rivard
    of the Superior Court of Justice dated March 2, 2004.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>GOUDGE
      J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 10 1998, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast a 20-minute
    segment of its program The Fifth Estate entitled “Prove It If You Can”.  By
    telling the stories of three people who suffered serious injuries in car
    accidents, and their difficulties with their insurers, the CBC described
    how insurance companies can treat accident victims unfairly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the three was Janet Hough.  While the focus of the program was the insurance
    industry, part of her story of unfair treatment was that her insurer sent
    her to the medical assessment firm it used, which reported that she was not
    disabled.  The insurer then stopped her accident benefits, despite medical
    reports from her treating physicians that supported her entitlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>AssessMed,
    the medical assessment firm, Jack Richman, its chief medical officer, and
    Hemendra Shah, the psychologist who did the report for AssessMed, sued for
    defamation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a 76-day trial, Rivard J., sitting alone, dismissed the action, finding that
    the defence of fair comment had been made out.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is the appeal from that judgment.  The appellants make two major attacks
    on it: first, that the trial judge erred in unduly narrowing the defamatory
    meaning of the broadcast; and second that the trial judge erred in a number
    of respects in applying the defence of fair comment.  For the reasons that
    follow, I conclude that both attacks fail and the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
  <h2 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>THE TRIAL JUDGMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    trial judge began his reasons with a careful review of the evidence.  He
    described the genesis of the idea for the program and the subsequent research
    for it done by the CBC, including the interviews that were done with a number
    of individuals familiar with most aspects of the business of insuring accident
    victims. He reviewed the growth of AssessMed into a substantial medical assessment
    firm providing opinions mainly for insurers and the role Dr. Shah performed
    for them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    then turned to the assessment of Janet Hough done by Dr. Shah.  He found
    that Dr. Shah used well validated tests and followed accepted procedures,
    but may have fallen into error in interpreting the test results and in failing
    to consider other important evidence.  He concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[70]            Dr.
    Shah’s approach was to look to test results, establish a hypothesis and proceed
    to find evidence to support that hypothesis. This becomes obvious when one
    reviews those portions of the reports he quoted from his assessment.  The
    selective approach he maintained can be viewed as consistent with confirmatory
    bias.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[71]            I
    am satisfied that, upon a review of all the medical and neuropsychological
    information available to Dr. Shah at the time he completed his assessment
    of Janet Hough, on the basis of the medical and psychiatric evidence which
    became available after this report was prepared, in light of the efforts
    made by Ms. Hough to return to her teaching and Ph.D. thesis, one could conclude
    that Dr. Shah’s assessment was in error.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[72]            The
    general philosophy of AssessMed, the manner in which Dr. Shah crafted his
    report, and the conclusions he expressed can also lead to a reasonable conclusion
    that his report was biased.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then reviewed in detail the content of the program, particularly
    the part that dealt with Janet Hough’s case. While Dr. Shah declined to be
    interviewed at all, the program included an interview with Dr. Richman, although
    he declined to talk about the particular case. In speaking generally about
    his business, Dr. Richman indicated his view that many of the claimants they
    see honestly believe they are disabled but are not.  He was interviewed along
    with a fellow executive of the Canadian Society of Medical Evaluations, Dr.
    Ameis. Dr. Ameis acknowledged that some insurers treat some claimants very
    badly but made clear that their company tried to be as objective and impartial
    as possible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However
    the program then quoted from an article by Dr. Richman saying that in 3,000
    evaluations by his company, only 3% needed long-term disability benefits.  The
    trial judge reviewed the article and concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'> [78]            This
    article manifested an intellectual tendency on the part of Dr. Richman to
    treat claimants with suspicion and to question the validity of the opinions
    expressed by their treating health care workers.  It was an attractive approach
    for those insurers who questioned the extent of their insured’s disability,
    but left doubt as to whether the approach resulting from this ideology was
    objective or impartial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[79]            While
    Dr. Richman’s opinions find some support in medical literature, they are
    considered too skeptical by others.  Dr. Richman’s research in this area
    was based on discussions with assessors at AssessMed but not on any empirical
    or validated study. In my view, it reflected a tendentious approach to assessments,
    which subjected AssessMed to being viewed as partial to insurers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge turned to the evidence of Dr. Michael Rathbone, who was Janet
    Hough’s treating neurologist and a defendant in the lawsuit.  He had treated
    her for over four years and had a thorough understanding of her medical difficulties.  He
    concluded that because of the brain injury she suffered in the accident,
    she was permanently impaired. The trial judge accepted this evidence and
    found that Dr. Rathbone’s conclusions were legitimate and to be preferred.  He
    then described Dr. Rathbone’s part in the program as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[97]            Dr.
    Rathbone was interviewed for the program “Prove It If You Can” on June 25,
    1998.  During the interview, it became known to MacIntyre and Kaufman he
    had not seen Dr. Shah’s report.  I am satisfied he took the time needed to
    review Dr. Shah’s report. When he was first shown the report, he looked at
    it and read some of the quotes Dr. Shah had relied on. He commented that
    some of the quotes were always negative quotes. He testified he felt the
    quotes were taken out of context and were misleading.  He agreed with MacIntyre’s
    suggestion that this was biased.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[98]            Dr.
    Rathbone then took some time to read Dr. Shah’s report.  Having done so,
    he said Dr. Shah’s report was “biased and unfortunately comes to a conclusion
    which is clearly in error”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[99]            I
    am satisfied that this comment was made by Dr. Rathbone independently of
    MacIntyre’s previous reference to bias and with a reasonably held belief
    that Dr. Shah’s report was in error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then began an equally careful legal analysis.  He first concluded
    that the plain and obvious meaning of the words used in the broadcast was
    capable of being defamatory:  it was capable of being understood as saying
    that the appellants participated with the insurance company in the wrongful
    denial of benefits payable to Janet Hough, a severely injured accident victim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    next considered the particular false innuendos pleaded by the appellants
    and found that the words used were capable of conveying some but not all
    of these meanings.  In particular, he found that they were not capable of
    meaning that the appellants used the same aggressive and sceptical approach
    with all claimants that they demonstrated with Janet Hough.  However he found
    that the program could be taken to mean that their medical evaluation of
    Janet Hough was affected by a predisposition to treat claimants as liars
    and fakers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then considered whether the broadcast was in fact understood
    in its defamatory sense and found that it was.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the defence of fair comment, the trial judge held that the words complained
    of were comments rather than bare facts which had no support, were based
    on facts referred to in the broadcast that were themselves true, and were
    comments on a matter of public interest.  They were honestly held views that
    a fair-minded person could reasonably hold. As well, they were fair in the
    sense that the program balanced them with expressions of the other side of
    the debate.  Finally he found that they were made without malice.  The defence
    of fair comment was thus successfully made out.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    though he found that the defence of fair comment succeeded, he went on to
    assess damages in case he was in error.  Finally, he concluded by dismissing
    the action with costs to the respondents, to be assessed.</p>
  <h2 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellants’ first argument is that the trial judge erred in unduly narrowing
    the defamatory meaning of the broadcast.  Here their primary submission focuses
    on the first step of the analysis, namely whether the program in its plain
    and obvious meaning or in the specific innuendos pleaded, is capable of defamatory
    meaning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants pleaded that the program was capable of being understood to mean
    that they treated all accident victims as liars, frauds or fakers and were
    biased medical evaluators. The trial judge disagreed that the program could
    give rise to an innuendo this broad and limited the range of possible meanings
    to Janet Hough’s case, and accident victims like her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no error in his doing so.  He reached this conclusion by properly considering
    not just the specific words advanced by the appellants but the full context
    in which those words appeared in the program.  This provided ample support
    for his conclusion that the innuendo advanced by the appellants – namely
    that they were biased medical evaluators who treated all claimants this way – was
    simply too broad. The program made clear through Dr. Richman, Dr. Ameis,
    and the CBC host, that some but not all claimants were frauds, and that this
    was recognized by the appellants.  While the trial judge found support for
    the innuendo that the appellants had a predisposition to treat claimants
    as liars or frauds, the program stopped short of saying they do so generally.  There
    clearly were cases where they did not treat the claimants this way.  I agree
    that the program is not capable of the broad innuendo asserted by the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case is not the same as <i>Barltrop v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</i>, [1978]
    86 D.L.R. (3d) 61 (N.S.C.A.) on which the appellants seek to rely.  There
    the defamatory words in the program were in a context that led to the conclusion
    that Dr. Barltrop was intellectually dishonest generally as a physician.
    Here the context simply does not permit the same general conclusion about
    the appellants’ approach to their cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument, the appellants also sought to support the innuendo that the
    program was capable of being understood to mean that the appellants were
    dishonest doctors in the pockets of insurers.  The simple answer to this
    is that the appellants did not plead this innuendo.  Moreover there is no
    suggestion in the program that in rendering their reports the appellants
    said what they did because they were paid to say so.  The trial judge did
    not need to consider this innuendo.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants say that the trial judge erred in finding that reasonable
    viewers understood the words of the program to mean that the opinion about
    Janet Hough in Dr. Shah’s report was biased and in error but not that his
    medical evaluation was performed improperly or incompetently.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree that the trial judge erred in this respect.  This finding is
    at step two of the determination of defamatory meaning, when the trial judge
    is addressing not the meanings the broadcast was capable of supporting, but
    how the broadcast was in fact understood by reasonable viewers.  As such,
    the trial judge’s conclusion is a finding of fact that deserves deference
    on appeal. Moreover, it is a finding well supported by the record.  The reasonable
    viewer would have understood the difference between the opinion expressed
    by Dr. Shah in his report and the medical testing of Janet Hough that he
    did before forming his opinion. While the former was said to be biased, nothing
    was said in the program to leave the understanding that the testing itself
    was done incompetently.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ second major attack is on the judge’s conclusion that the statements
    he found to be defamatory constituted fair comment. Here they raise a number
    of arguments.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    they say that the trial judge erred in finding these statements to be comment
    not statements of fact.  Again, I do not agree.  The trial judge carefully
    explained that the defamatory statements were in each case derived from facts
    stated in the program and that reasonable viewers would have recognized the
    statements to be the commentator’s opinions about, or conclusions drawn,
    from those facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, Dr. Rathbone’s statement that Dr. Shah’s report was biased and in
    error was presented in the context of the facts about his treatment of Janet
    Hough over five years and would be seen by reasonable viewers as an expression
    of his opinion, based on his own treatment of her, about Dr. Shah’s conclusions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
    example is the statement found to carry the defamatory meaning that the appellants’ medical
    evaluation of Janet Hough was indicative of their predisposition to treat
    claimants as liars or frauds.  This was clearly a conclusion drawn from a
    number of facts stated in the program including the treatment accorded to
    Janet Hough, and Dr. Richman’s published article. The reasonable viewer would
    have had no difficulty understanding it that way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge made the same assessment for all of the defamatory statements
    he found.  In this respect, this case cannot be compared to <i>Barltrop</i> or <i>Leenan
    v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</i> (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 656 affirmed (2001),
    54 O.R. (3d) 312 (Ont. C.A.).  In those cases, there were insufficient basic
    facts presented in the program to permit reasonable viewers to understand
    that the defamatory statements were opinions or judgments drawn from those
    facts rather than themselves free-standing assertions of fact.</p>

    appellants then argue that the trial judge erred in finding that the program
    presented both sides of the debate in a balanced way.  I find no error in
    his conclusion. The broad debate, so far as it related to the appellants
    rather than the insurers, was whether as medical evaluators they approached
    accident victims with a certain predisposition or whether they did so objectively.  The
    program stated its own opinion on this but also presented the appellants’ view,
    through Dr. Richman’s colleague Dr. Ameis, that they tried to be as objective
    and impartial as possible.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if one were to apply this fairness requirement to the particular innuendo
    that Dr. Shah’s position that Janet Hough was not disabled was without support,
    there is still no error.  As the trial judge found, the medical evidence
    established that she was disabled, that early medical reports that might
    support the contrary view were overly optimistic and wrong, and that this
    was clear by the time of the broadcast.  Thus there was no support for Dr.
    Shah’s position to be presented.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    although not addressed in oral argument, in their factum the appellants attack
    the trial judge’s conclusion that the comments were based on facts that were
    themselves true.  Again, I disagree.  What is required for the fair comment
    defence to be established is that there be a sufficient basis of fact to
    warrant the comment. The trial judge set out in great detail the facts in
    the program upon which the defamatory comments were based and found that
    all were proven to be substantially true. These findings deserve significant
    deference in this court.  All have a basis in the evidence.  None represent
    palpable and overriding error.  This includes the finding of an absence of
    malice based on the trial judge’s assessment of the credibility of the respondents
    and his conclusion that they each honestly believe the statements and held
    the opinions and drew the conclusions presented in the program.</p>

line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, therefore, I find no basis to interfere with the conclusion of the
    trial judge that the respondents properly established the defence of fair
    comment.</p>

    concluding, there are several matters that require brief comment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    it was not separately pursued in oral argument, in their factum the appellants
    launch a discrete attack on the trial judge’s conclusion concerning Dr. Rathbone’s
    statements.  As I understand it, this is essentially a reiteration in this
    specific context of their fair comment arguments that I have already dealt
    with, and I would give the same answers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also challenge the trial judge’s damage assessment. Given the
    disposition I would make of the appeal on liability, I do not think it necessary
    to address this argument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    like measure there are four other matters that need not be dealt with.  The
    appellants brought separate appeals from each of two intra-trial rulings
    denying their request to amend their pleadings to broaden the damage claim.
    The respondents also appealed a ruling at trial denying their request to
    amend their pleadings on an aspect of liability and a cross-appeal on damages
    contingent on the liability appeal being allowed.  Given my disposition of
    the latter, it is unnecessary to deal with any of these.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons I conclude that the appeal must be dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no reason why the respondents should not receive their costs on a partial
    indemnity basis.  Together their proposed costs total some $120,000.00. For
    their part, the appellants suggested that if successful they should receive
    $100,000.00.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial took 76 days – much too long, as the court indicated on the hearing
    of this appeal. This unfortunately necessitated review of a huge volume of
    material in what was in significant measure a fact driven appeal.  Argument
    of the appeal took two days.  Taking these factors into consideration, I
    conclude that a reasonable amount for costs is $80,000.00 all inclusive,
    split $30,000.00 to Dr. Rathbone and $50,000.00 to the remaining respondents.</p>
