      McNeil were married.  They separated in August 2000 and Ms. McNeil took
      up residence in a small town in northern Ontario with Mr. Graves.  Their
      relationship was initially platonic, but by September 12, 2000 appeared
      to have developed into something more than that.  </span></p>

      September 11, 2000, the appellant drove through the night from his home
      to Mr. Graves’ home.  The trip took about 8 hours.  The appellant had at
      least one loaded handgun with him on the trip and was also carrying two
      cans full of gasoline.  Neither Ms. McNeil nor Mr. Graves knew that the
      appellant was coming to the Graves’ home.</span></p>

      appellant arrived at the Graves’
    home in the early morning hours of September 12.  He slept in his car a short
    distance from the house.  At about 5:30 a.m., he awoke and drove up to the
    home.  He saw Mr. Graves’ car outside.  According to the appellant, he thought
    Mr. Graves would be at work and assumed when he saw the car that Mr. Graves
    had received a ride to work with somebody else.</span></p>

      appellant entered the Graves’ home unannounced.  He first encountered Mr.
      Graves.  There was evidence that they scuffled and the appellant eventually
      pointed a gun at Mr. Graves and ordered him to sit on the couch.  The appellant
      and Mr. Graves were together in the living room or kitchen for some unspecified
      time.  Ms. McNeil came out of the bedroom when she heard the scuffling
      noises.  The appellant and Ms. McNeil gave very different versions of what
      happened next.   </span></p>

      to Ms. McNeil, the appellant pointed a gun at her and Mr. Graves.  She
      spoke with the appellant and tried to calm him down.  During their conversation,
      Ms. McNeil got up from the couch and went to the window to see if she could
      see the appellant’s car.  As she was looking out the window, she heard
      three shots.  She turned to see Mr. Graves on the ground and the appellant
      fumbling with the gun; he appeared to be trying to put something into the
      gun.  The appellant attacked Ms. McNeil, repeatedly striking her on the
      head with the weapon.  Ms. McNeil tried unsuccessfully to pull the gun
      from the appellant’s hands.  They fell to the ground and the appellant
      continued to pummel her with the gun.  Ms. McNeil decided to “play dead”,
      hoping the appellant would stop hitting her.  He hit her several more times
      and then left the living room.  He returned moments later, spread gasoline
      around the inside of the home and set it on fire.  He fled the scene in
      his car.  </span></p>

      to the appellant, he drove through the night because he became concerned
      that Ms. McNeil had taken one of his guns with her.  The appellant was
      worried that she could be charged with transporting an unregistered firearm.  He
      arrived at the Graves’ home thinking Mr. Graves was at work.  When he entered
      the home, he encountered Mr. Graves first.  Ms. McNeil appeared immediately
      afterward and the two argued.  She produced a gun and pointed it at the
      appellant.  The appellant grabbed the barrel of the gun and they struggled.  During
      the struggle, the gun discharged several times.  One or more of the shots
      hit and killed Mr. Graves.  The appellant took the gun from Ms. McNeil
      and began hitting her on the head with it.  He testified that he had no
      memory of what happened after he began to strike Ms. McNeil.  The appellant
      could not remember lighting the fire.  His next memory was being stopped
      by the police around 8:00 a.m. that morning.</span></p>

      on the charge of attempting to murder Ms. McNeil, he acknowledged that
      a conviction could well be returned by the jury.  The real dispute at the

      Mr. Graves, there was no evidence that the appellant had planned and deliberated

      or that the murder was committed while the appellant was forcefully confining
      Mr. Graves under s. 231(5).  Counsel for the appellant acknowledges that

      trial judge’s instruction on s. 231(5) began by describing for the jury
      the essential elements of liability under that section:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>1)  that James
    McNeil caused the death of George Graves;</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>And here is
    where section 235 comes in.  <u>There is a fourth essential element.  And
    it reads, that James McNeil did something that was an essential, substantial,
    and integral part of killing George Graves.  That is the unlawful confinement
    of George Graves at gunpoint – sit down.</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>That James McNeil
    committed murder on George Graves is the fifth element.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The sixth element,
    that the murder of George Graves was part of the same series of events.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>

line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
      a description of the first two elements, the trial judge turned to the
      third element of liability under s. 231(5):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Did James McNeil
    do something that was an essential and substantial integral part of the killing
    of George Graves?  This is the only different essential element that arises
    out of this section in the Code.  To prove this element, Crown counsel must
    prove beyond a reasonable doubt that James McNeil did <u>something that was
    an essential, substantial, and integral part of the killing of George Graves.  By “essential,
    substantial, and integral part”, I mean that James McNeil actively participated
    in the killing of George Graves.  It is not enough to prove that James McNeil
    was present, or that he played some minor role in the events.  To convict
    someone of first degree murder under this section of the Criminal Code, in
    this context, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt  that the accused
    is an active participant in the killing.</u>  So consider all of the evidence
    in considering this issue. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge also explained the significance of forcible or unlawful confinement
      to potential liability under s. 231(5):</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The key to this
    section is whether 1) there was unlawful confinement of George Graves; and
    that the murder of George Graves was part of the same series of events.  In
    order for James McNeil to be guilty of first degree murder, Crown counsel
    must prove, also prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that James McNeil murdered
    George Graves while he was committing the offence of unlawful confinement.  This
    does <u>not mean that the murder and that the unlawful confinement, where
    he was told to sit down, have to happen exactly at the same moment.  As far
    as unlawful confinement for the Crown to succeed, that George Graves was
    unlawfully confined, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
    Graves was totally physically restrained against his will without lawful
    authority, and that Jim McNeil intended to totally restrain George Graves
    against his will.</u>  You may consider that a pointed loaded firearm, and
    forcing you to sit down, may be lawful confinement.  You heard the evidence
    of James McNeil who rapped, entered into the house.  George was home.  You
    heard Cathy’s evidence that she heard Jim say, “Shut the fuck up and sit
    down”.  And you also heard her evidence in relation to the fact that he had
    a gun.  So has the Crown proven beyond a reasonable doubt that James McNeil
    unlawfully confined George Graves?  His evidence is that he did not have
    the gun and did not confine George Graves.  And again, this is for your consideration.  <u>So
    if you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the unlawful confinement
    and murder of George Graves was part of the same series of events, on this
    charge, you must find James McNeil not guilty of first degree murder but
    guilty of second degree murder.  If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the unlawful confinement and the murder of George Graves was part
    of the same series of events, you must also find James McNeil guilty of first
    degree murder.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>

      targets the trial judge’s description of what he characterized as the third
      element of liability under s. 231(5).  That description is found in the
      passages set out in paras. 15 and 16, above.  Counsel submits that the
      instruction suggested to the jury that the appellant could be liable for
      first degree murder under s. 231(5) if the jury were to find that he actively
      participated in the struggle with Ms. McNeil that, on the appellant’s evidence,
      precipitated the shooting of Mr. Graves.  Counsel contends that the Crown’s
      case against the appellant under s. 231(5) rested entirely on the assertion
      that the appellant had intentionally shot Mr. Graves while Ms. McNeil was
      standing some distance away.  Counsel argues that an instruction which
      suggested potential liability for acts other than the intentional discharge
      of the firearm at Mr. Graves constituted misdirection that seriously prejudiced
      the appellant.  </span></p>

      counsel argues that even if the instructions did not suggest liability

      they must have left the jury confused and uncertain as to the application

      the law on the causation requirement for liability under s. 231(5).  Jury
      instructions are not, however, intended to provide a statement of legal
      principles in the abstract.  Jury instructions must, as Justice Watt, the
      author of the model instructions and others have emphasized, be tailored
      to the facts of the specific case.  The model instructions are intended
      to provide a starting point for trial judges.  In some cases, the language
      in the model instructions can be used virtually without change.  In other
      cases, modification will be needed so that the instructions will achieve
      the purpose of providing the jury with the applicable legal principles
      in a format that facilitates the application of those principles to the
      specific circumstances of the case.  </span></p>

      this case, the causation question was straightforward.  If the Crown proved
      beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant intentionally shot Mr. Graves,
      then the Crown would have established causation for all relevant purposes,
      including s. 231(5).  If the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt
      that the appellant intentionally shot Mr. Graves, then the Crown would
      have failed to prove causation in respect of all of the relevant homicide
      provisions, including s. 231(5).  There was no evidentiary basis for a
      finding of causation apart from finding that the appellant intentionally
      shot Mr. Graves.  </span></p>

      must agree with counsel’s submission that the trial judge’s reference to
      causation under s. 231(5), as requiring proof that the appellant’s conduct
      played an “essential, substantial, and integral part” in the killing, was
      potentially confusing since it bore no relationship to the evidence relevant
      to causation heard by the jury.  By seemingly connecting the causation
      requirement with the unlawful confinement requirement (<i>supra</i>, para.
      15), the trial judge’s instructions may have added to the confusion.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      am satisfied, however, that the causation instruction, although confusing,
      caused no prejudice to the appellant.  The trial judge repeatedly and clearly
      told the jury that it could not convict the appellant of first degree murder
      under s. 231(5) unless it was satisfied that the appellant’s actions were
      the physical cause of Mr. Graves’ death, that the appellant had one of
      the two intentions required for murder, and that he had caused Mr. Graves’ death.  The
      trial judge’s reference to the requirement that the appellant’s actions
      must be “an essential, substantial, and integral part” of the killing could
      not have detracted from the clarity of his instructions concerning the
      requisite intent.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      jury’s verdict demonstrates that it was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
      that the appellant had the intention required for murder.  The jury could
      not possibly have come to that conclusion unless it was satisfied beyond
      a reasonable doubt that the appellant intentionally fired the gun at Mr.
      Graves causing his death.  Had the appellant’s evidence, considered alone
      or in combination with the entirety of the evidence, left the jury with
      any doubt as to how Mr. Graves was shot, the jury could not possibly have
      found that the appellant had the intent required for murder.  No exception
      is or can be taken to the trial judge’s instruction regarding the intention
      required for murder.  The jury’s verdict reflects a finding beyond a reasonable
      doubt of the necessary intent and forecloses a finding that the appellant
      was prejudiced by any confusion that may have been engendered by the causation
      instruction as it related to s. 231(5).</span></p>

      would dismiss the appeal.  I would also add one further observation.  The
      trial judge, who obviously worked hard on preparing and delivering this
      jury charge, provided the jury with copies of <i>Criminal Code</i>  provisions
      and extracts from Justice Watt’s model charges.  This kind of written material
      can assist the jury in the course of their deliberations: see N. Madge, <i>Summing
      Up – A Judge’s Perspective</i> [2006] Crim. L.R. 817 at 820-21.  It is
      important, however, that the trial judge and counsel ensure that a copy
      of anything left with the jury forms part of the permanent trial record
      so that it will be available on appeal should the verdict be challenged.  That
      was not done here and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to exactly
      what material the jury had with it during its deliberations.  </span></p>

    counsel argued that there was no evidentiary basis for a finding that the
    appellant planned and deliberated the murder of Mr. Graves.  Counsel put
    heavy reliance on the evidence that the appellant did not expect Mr. Graves
    to be home when he entered the house.  While there was evidence to that effect,
    it had to be considered in the context of the entirety of the evidence.  The
    entirety of the evidence included evidence from which it could be inferred
    that whatever the appellant may have believed when he drove from his home
    to the Graves’ residence, he knew that Mr. Graves was at home before he entered
    the house.  The jury could have found that regardless of the initial scope
    of the appellant’s murderous plan, it included Mr. Graves by the time he
    was shot.</p>

    judge provided the jury with excerpts of Justice Watt’s model instructions

    some uncertainty as to exactly what parts of the model instructions were
    left with the jury, although it appears that the extracts setting out the
    essential elements of liability under s. 231(5) were provided.</p>
