      is an appeal from conviction and affects two charges of importing.  The
      appeal raises two issues.  </span></p>

      appellant did not testify.  It is difficult to see how the trial judge’s
      instructions referable to how the jury should assess the credibility and
      reliability of the testimony of witnesses could possibly have prejudiced
      the appellant.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      appellant did give a videotaped statement to police.  The Crown introduced
      this statement into evidence.  Both the defence and the Crown relied on
      the statement.  The Crown argued that it demonstrated knowledge of the
      conspiracy to import drugs into Canada, while the defence argued that it
      showed knowledge of a conspiracy to smuggle something into Canada, but
      not narcotics.  The trial judge reviewed parts of the videotape at different
      stages of his instructions to the jury.  He made it clear to the jury that
      it should carefully review the tape in the course of its deliberations
      so it could make its own assessment of the tape, and that it should not
      feel bound by any observations made by witnesses or counsel concerning
      what was said on the tape, or the appellant’s demeanour while the videotape
      was being made.  In our view, the instructions in relation to the jury’s
      assessment of the videotape were complete and not unfair to the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      any event, even if the instructions referable to how the jury should assess
      a witness’s credibility could be understood as applicable to the videotaped
      statement, the instructions did not suggest that what the accused said
      was automatically suspect because of his stake in the outcome of the trial.  Nor
      did they suggest that anything that the accused said should for that reason,
      be subject to special scrutiny.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      instructions that a witness’s interest in the outcome or motive may affect
      that witness’s credibility were general and equally applicable to all witnesses.  The
      instruction did not isolate the statements of the accused or suggest that
      they were worthy of special scrutiny.  Indeed, the reference relied on
      by the appellant to the potential motive of witnesses, by its own terms,
      could not have applied to the accused’s videotaped statement.</span></p>

      trial judge’s description of the position of the appellant in the part
      of his charge headed “The Position of the Defence” was so brief as to be
      unhelpful.  It must be said that his description of the position of the
      Crown was equally brief and unhelpful.  However, throughout the rest of
      his thorough charge, the trial judge made it clear that the appellant’s
      defence was that he did not know that there were drugs in the bag.  This
      was a single issue trial.  The defence of lack of knowledge had to be crystal
      clear to this jury by the time it retired to deliberate.  No objection
      was taken by counsel for the appellant to the trial judge’s failure to
      describe the position of the defence in more detail.  </span></p>
