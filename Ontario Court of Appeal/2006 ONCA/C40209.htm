      was acquitted on main charge, but was convicted on the included offence
      of assault causing bodily harm.  He appeals from that conviction. </span></p>

      and that the appellant’s conviction on that charge cannot stand.  </span></p>

      appellant became involved in an altercation with his roommate and a co-worker
      of his roommate late one evening at the apartment that the appellant and
      his roommate shared.  During the altercation, the appellant picked up two
      knives and struck the co-worker across the chin with one of them causing
      an eighteen stitch gash.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      appellant, his girlfriend who was present during the altercation, the roommate
      and the co-worker all testified.  Not surprisingly, their description of
      the relevant events differed in many details.  It was common ground, however,
      that the appellant struck the co-worker on the chin with the knife in the
      course of the altercation.  There was also no dispute that the co-worker
      suffered an eighteen stitch gash when struck with the knife.  </span></p>

      appellant advanced two defences at trial.  He maintained that he did not
      intend to strike the co-worker with the knife, but only meant to wave it
      at him so that the co-worker would not attack the appellant.  The appellant
      also contended that he acted in self defence.  The trial judge left both
      defences with the jury, and no objection is taken to his instructions in
      respect of either defence.  </span></p>

      instructing the jury on the aggravated assault charge, the trial judge
      left with the jury the included offences of assault causing bodily harm
      and assault.  He did so without asking counsel for submissions as to the
      availability of these included offences.  Immediately after the instructions
      were complete, trial counsel for the appellant objected and submitted that
      the included offences should not have been left with the jury.  She said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><u><span
lang=EN-US>[T]he included offences which, in my respectful submission, aren’t
        really an issue before the jury</span></u><span
lang=EN-US> …  The defence is not arguing that, and if it was intentional, it
        wasn’t an aggravated.  <u>I mean the defence position is if they find
        it’s intentional, it was an aggravated assault and nothing less</u> such
        that the jury should not get sidetracked and, as well with the assault
        with the weapon [emphasis added].</span></p>

      trial judge did not ask the Crown for submissions on the question of whether
      the included offences should have been left with the jury and did not recharge
      the jury.  As indicated above, the jury acquitted on the aggravated assault
      charge and convicted on the included offence of assault causing bodily
      harm.</span></p>

      appeal, counsel for the appellant renews the argument that the trial judge
      should not have left the included offences of assault causing bodily harm
      and assault with the jury.  She submits that this was an “all or nothing” case.  If
      the jury had a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant struck the
      co-worker intentionally or a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant
      acted in self defence, the jury was obliged to acquit the appellant.  If
      the jury did not have a reasonable doubt on either of these two issues,
      then, as the injury clearly amounted to a wounding as defined for the jury,
      a conviction on the full charge of aggravated assault was the only available
      verdict.  </span></p>

      submits that the verdict of the jury indicates that it was either confused
      as to the essential elements of the offence of aggravated assault or reached
      a compromise verdict.  Counsel argues that a conviction on a charge that
      should not have been left with the jury cannot stand even if logic suggests
      that had the jury properly applied the law, it would have convicted of
      the full offence.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      her submissions, Crown counsel contends that the trial judge did not err
      in leaving the included offence with the jury.  She further argues that
      the jury’s verdict signals a clear rejection of the defences advanced by
      the appellant.  In oral argument, however, Crown counsel acknowledged,
      correctly, that on the evidence the acquittal on the aggravated assault
      charge and the conviction on the included offence of assault causing bodily
      harm are logically irreconcilable.  </span></p>

      offence of assault causing bodily harm is an included offence in a charge
      of aggravated assault by wounding:  see <i>Criminal Code</i> s. 662(1), <i>R.
      v. R. (G.)</i> (2005), 198 C.C.C. (3d) 161 at paras. 25-34 (S.C.C.).  A
      trial judge is not, however, obliged to instruct a jury on all offences
      that are as a matter of law included offences.  The trial judge’s obligation
      to instruct on included offences will depend on the evidence led, the issues
      raised and the positions of the parties:  see <i>R. v. Smith</i> (1978),
      43 C.C.C. (2d) 417 (S.C.C.).  It has long been recognized that in some
      cases, having regard to the entirety of the evidence, the issues raised
      by the evidence, and the positions taken by the parties, an “all or nothing”
    instruction leaving the jury with only two possible verdicts – guilty or
    not guilty – is appropriate:  see <i>e.g. R. v. Melyniuk and Humeniuk</i> (1930),
    53 C.C.C. 296 at 300 (Alta. C.A.), aff’d (1930), 58 C.C.C. 106 (S.C.C.);  <i>R.

    82 C.C.C. (3d) 215 (S.C.C.);  <i>R. v. Wade</i> (1995), 98 C.C.C. (3d) 97

      on the law applicable to the main charge and the included offence there
      is no reasonable view of the evidence, when considered as a whole, that
      could cause the jury to acquit on the main charge and convict on the included
      offence, an instruction on included offences is a breeding ground for confusion
      and compromise.  Neither are conducive to a true verdict.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      was no reasonable view of the evidence that would yield an acquittal on
      the charge of aggravated assault by wounding and a conviction on the included
      offence of assault causing bodily harm.  The essential elements of the
      two offences differ only in the nature of the injury required to establish
      each offence.  On the undisputed evidence, as confirmed by counsel for
      the appellant at trial, the injury suffered by the co-worker amounted to
      a wounding.  Indeed, the trial judge told the jury:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>To wound means to injure someone in a way that breaks or cuts or pierces
      or tears the skin or some part of the person’s body.  It must be something
      more than trifling, fleeting or minor such as a … I don’t believe there’s
      any issue here that the laceration that Mr. Cheema [the co-worker] suffered
      would constitute a wound.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      nature of the injury suffered by the co-worker could not provide a basis
      for acquitting the appellant on the main charge and convicting him on the
      included offence.  There was no other meaningful distinction to be made
      between the two offences on the evidence adduced.  Had either of the appellant’s
      defences left the jury with a reasonable doubt, he was entitled to an outright
      acquittal.  If both failed, there was no reason why he should not be convicted
      of the full offence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      can think of only two possible explanations for the verdicts.  The jury
      may have misunderstood the definition of wounding, or the verdict may reflect
      a compromise between factions on the jury, some whom favoured an outright
      acquittal and others who favoured a conviction on the main charge.  On
      either explanation, the conviction cannot stand.  In the language applicable
      to inconsistent verdicts, a conviction on the included offence of assault
      causing bodily harm cannot be reconciled on any rationale or logical basis
      with an acquittal on the charge of aggravated assault by wounding:  <i>R.
      v. Pittiman</i> (2006), 206 C.C.C. (3d) 6 at paras. 7-8 (S.C.C.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before
      turning to the appropriate order, I will make one further observation.  This
      was not an easy jury instruction.  The trial judge had to deal with several
      complicated matters, including the notoriously complicated law of self-defence.  His
      charge was exemplary in many respects.  It is unfortunate that he did not
      canvass with counsel the availability of the included offences before instructing
      the jury on those offences.  While it is ultimately up to the trial judge
      to decide whether, in the totality of the circumstances, an instruction
      on included offences is appropriate, the position of the parties on that
      issue should assist the trial judge in determining whether any included
      offences are in play.  I cannot help but think that, had the trial judge
      had the benefit of the submissions that this court heard before he instructed
      on the included offences, he would not have done so.  </span></p>
  <h3 align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>V</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given
      my conclusion that the conviction cannot stand, the question becomes what
      order should this court make.  Section 686(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides
      that where the court allows an appeal from conviction it shall quash the
      conviction and either direct a verdict of acquittal or order a new trial.  If
      the court were to order a new trial, that new trial could not be on the
      charge of aggravated assault by wounding.  The Crown could have, but chose
      not to, appeal the acquittal on the main charge:  <i>Criminal Code</i> s.
      676(2).  Absent a Crown appeal, this court cannot set aside the acquittal
      on the charge of aggravated assault by wounding and order a new trial on
      that charge:  <i>R. v. Guillemette</i> (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 5 (S.C.C.).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor,
      in my view, would an order directing a new trial on the charge of assault
      causing bodily harm make sense.  It would seem incongruous having held
      that the trial judge erred in leaving the charge of assault causing bodily
      harm with the jury to turn around and order a new trial on that charge.  More
      to the point, as the acquittal on the aggravated assault charge stands,
      any verdict other than an acquittal on a charge of assault causing bodily
      harm would in the circumstances of this case constitute an inconsistent
      and unreasonable verdict:  <i>R. v. Pittiman</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para.
      14.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An
      outright acquittal of the appellant is not a palatable result.  There was
      ample evidence on which the jury could have convicted on the wounding charge.  Indeed,
      it might be said that, in light of the apparent rejection of the appellant’s
      two defences, the jury should have convicted on the wounding charge.  Furthermore,
      but for the extant acquittal on the wounding charge, there would be nothing
      to prevent this court from ordering a retrial on the assault causing bodily
      harm charge.  There is ample evidence to support a conviction on that charge. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i><span lang=EN-US>Pittiman</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 14, holds that a new trial will usually be
      the appropriate order where there is evidence to support the verdict which
      is found to have been inconsistent.  That holding assumes, as was the case
      in <i>Pittiman</i>, that the charge giving rise to the inconsistent verdict
      was properly left to the jury.  I have concluded that this jury should
      not have been instructed on the offence of assault causing bodily harm.  I
      have further concluded that there is no proper basis upon which a jury
      could acquit on the wounding charge and convict on the charge of assault
      causing bodily harm.  As the acquittal on the wounding charge stands, the
      only possible result on the causing bodily harm charge is also an acquittal.  </span></p>
