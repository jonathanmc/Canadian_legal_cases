      appropriate general damages as well as substantial aggravated and punitive
      damages.  </span></p>

      respondents resist the appeals.  They contend that the allegations of a
      reasonable apprehension of bias and procedural unfairness are baseless.  They
      also submit that the trial judge properly understood the concept of racial
      profiling, considered the relevant evidence, and made findings of fact
      that negated the contention that the appellants were subjected to racial
      profiling.  The respondents submit that the trial judge made no error in
      this aspect of his fact finding.  With respect to the other alleged factual
      errors, the respondents contend that the case turned almost entirely on
      the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence and, in particular, the credibility
      of the appellants and respondents.  The respondents maintain that the trial
      judge’s reasons demonstrate a strong grasp of the relevant evidence and
      a careful consideration of that evidence.  They submit that none of the
      trial judge’s material findings of fact are tainted by palpable and overriding
      error.  </span></p>

      would dismiss the appeals.  The allegations of a reasonable apprehension
      of bias and unfairness by the trial judge are devoid of merit.  The trial
      judge appreciated the existence and nature of racial profiling.  Whether
      it occurred in this case was essentially a factual finding.  I see no error
      in the trial judge’s treatment of the evidence relevant to the racial profiling
      issue.  His ultimate conclusion that the appellants were not racially profiled
      was a reasonable one on the facts as found by the trial judge.  </span></p>

      further than to demonstrate that on the evidence there was ample room for
      reasonable disagreement with some of the factual conclusions arrived at
      by the trial judge.  This court does not and cannot retry cases, but must
      defer to the trial judge’s factual findings absent clear and overriding
      error.  The appellants have failed to demonstrate any such error.</span></p>

      the Peel Regional Police Services Board (the “Board”).  Race is central

      Road in Mississauga.  Dundas Street is a main east/west artery and Dixie
      Road is a main north/south street.  The vehicle belonged to Mr. Peart,
      but was registered in the name of his cousin who lived in Downsview, several
      kilometres from Mississauga.  Mr. Peart and Mr. Grant were driving to Mr.

      appellants acknowledged that Mr. Peart was driving in excess of the speed
      limit.  He habitually drove above the speed limit.  Mr. Peart became aware
      that a police vehicle with its lights flashing and siren sounding was following
      them.  Mr. Grant was concerned with the way Mr. Peart was driving and asked

      a short distance away.  He felt it would be safer for him to stop there.  He
      drove his vehicle along various streets until he arrived at his driveway

      or search them.  They contend that their mistreatment, including the coercion
      of Mr. Peart into acting as a police informant, was the product of racial
      profiling and overtly racist actions by various police officers, including
      Officer Ceballo and Officer Pedler.  The appellants contend that the officers
      assumed because Mr. Grant and Mr. Peart were two young black men out in

      Ceballo testified that he was stopped southbound at a traffic light at
      Dixie and Dundas when he saw the appellants’ vehicle go past him travelling
      westbound on Dundas.  Officer Ceballo was on routine traffic patrol.  He
      decided to run a computer check on the appellants’ vehicle.  According
      to Officer Ceballo, when he was on patrol and had time, he routinely ran
      computer checks on licence plates.  This was especially true at night when
      there was little traffic.  Officer Ceballo also testified that Honda Preludes,
      the model of vehicle driven by the appellants, are known to be easily stolen
      and that car theft was a prevalent problem in the area.  </span></p>

      after Officer Ceballo inputted the appellants’ licence plate number into
      his computer, the appellants’ vehicle turned across Dundas Street into
      the gas station.  Officer Ceballo parked his vehicle across the street
      from the gas station so that he could watch the vehicle until he received
      the results of his computer check.  While he was watching the vehicle,
      Officer Ceballo received information on the computer indicating that the
      vehicle was registered to a person in Downsview and that it had not been
      reported stolen.  </span></p>

      his examination-in-chief, Officer Ceballo said that he was unsure whether
      he realized that the occupants of the vehicle were black before they got
      out of the vehicle at the gas station.  In cross-examination, Officer Ceballo
      was confronted with his evidence on discovery.  On discovery, he had testified
      that he knew the appellants were black before they got out of their vehicle.  Officer
      Ceballo accepted the accuracy of his discovery evidence.    </span></p>

      Ceballo testified that he saw the person who had been sitting in the passenger
      seat get into the driver’s seat and the former driver sit in the passenger
      seat.  Much to Officer Ceballo’s surprise, the vehicle pulled out of the
      gas station at a high speed and accelerated to an even greater speed going
      westbound on Dundas Street.  The vehicle proceeded westbound at a speed
      well in excess of the 60 kilometre speed limit.  Officer Ceballo indicated
      that he pulled onto Dundas Street and followed the vehicle.  He quickly
      reached a speed of 140 kilometres per hour and did not gain significantly
      on the appellants’ vehicle.  </span></p>

      Ceballo testified that he followed the vehicle because it was travelling
      at a high rate of speed, it was registered in Downsview, the passenger
      and driver switched places, and the vehicle could be stolen.  Shortly after
      Officer Ceballo turned westbound onto Dundas Street, he activated his police
      lights and siren.  There was very little traffic and Officer Ceballo’s
      vehicle was directly behind the vehicle driven by Mr. Peart.  Mr. Peart
      did not stop his vehicle, but instead continued to speed away at over 100
      kilometres per hour.  Mr. Peart was driving dangerously and appeared to
      be taking evasive action.  When Mr. Peart turned northbound off of Dundas
      Street, he almost hit a southbound vehicle.  According to Officer Ceballo, “[i]t
      looked to me like these guys were running”.</span></p>

    serve as a vehicle for the imposition of community prejudices.  <u>The</u> <u>appropriate

      affected by racial bias.  This inquiry does not look to whether the trial
      judge has drawn distinctions based on race and does not differentiate between
      appropriate and inappropriate racial distinctions.  On the bias inquiry

      a discriminatory one for the purposes of the equality analysis lies largely
      in the perception of those who bear the burden of the distinction. Consequently,
      where state action draws a distinction based on race, it misses the point
      of the s. 15 equality analysis to ask how the hypothetical, reasonable,
      but raceless person would perceive a distinction based on race. The impact

      of a litigant, such as race, may well affect the litigant’s personal view

      of bias where one would otherwise not exist.  The outcome of a bias inquiry

      equate that personal perception of bias with a reasonable apprehension
      of bias is to use a subjective and inherently partial perspective to decide
      whether a proceeding was conducted impartially.  The ACLC did not argue
      that the perspective of the reasonable black person should be equated with
      the perception of the black appellants.  Although the ACLC did not equate
      the hypothetical, reasonable black person with the appellants, it did not
      indicate how the court should determine whether the hypothetical, reasonable

    realization that the hypothetical, reasonable person is to some degree reflective
    of the judge’s own preconceptions is what makes an appreciation of social
    context so important.  An understanding of how others legitimately view the
    circumstances serves to counteract the subjectivity of the judge’s own view
    of the world.  A proper reasonable apprehension of bias inquiry demands that
    the judge be aware of his or her own world view and appreciate how others

      the material findings are unreasonable or otherwise demonstrate reversible

      the result turns on credibility assessments, it is hardly surprising that
      the reasons for judgment will reflect negatively on the party who the trial

      the failure to call evidence that could have assisted the appellants.  He
      did not use the failure to call this evidence as proof of the contrary,
      but as one of many factors to be considered in assessing the weight of
      the appellants’ evidence.  For example, when discussing the events surrounding
      the arrests of the appellants at Mr. Peart’s home, the trial judge said
      at para. 105:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There was a

      judge.  Clearly, had the videotape equipment been used, it could have been
      indicated on the videotape that it was being turned off for the purposes
      of conducting a strip search.  I would not hold, however, that one suspect
      line of reasoning among many resulted in any unfairness to the appellants.  The

      changed), but would not fault the officers for following it.  This is a

      judges are required to give counsel an adequate opportunity to make submissions.  Trial
      judges are not, however, required to vet each and every step in their fact
      finding analysis with counsel.  Nor are trial judges required to invite
      submissions targeting each and every step of the fact finding analysis.  As

      must have regard to the kinds of considerations which as a matter of common

      or the credibility of the witnesses.   Counsel are expected to make whatever
      arguments they deem appropriate directed at issues which, as a matter of
      common sense, arise in the evidence and could affect the trial judge’s
      assessment of the evidence.  I do not think that counsel can reasonably

      that racial profiling precipitates could be justified apart from resort
      to negative stereotyping based on race.  For example, a police officer
      who sees a vehicle speeding and decides to pull the vehicle over in part
      because of the driver’s colour is engaged in racial profiling even though
      the speed of the vehicle could have justified the officer’s action: <i>Brown
      v. Durham Regional Police Force</i> (1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.).  Police

      cannot, however, accept the submission made by the ACLC that if the initial
      action taken by the police towards an individual is tainted by improper
      racial considerations, further actions taken towards that individual by
      the police will always be equally tainted.  Often, the initial improper
      racial consideration will flow through to the subsequent police conduct.  There
      will be situations, however, where despite improper racial profiling in
      the initial contact, the subsequent acts of the police are based on and
      justified by non-racial considerations.  To take an extreme example, an
      officer may follow a person of colour on a public highway in part because
      that person is black.  In doing so, even though the officer is not necessarily
      interfering with the individual’s constitutional rights, the officer is
      acting improperly.  However, if the officer were to observe that person
      firing a gun at someone and proceed to arrest that person, the arrest would
      not necessarily be tainted by the initial improper racial profiling.  It
      would be for the trier of fact to decide whether race played any role in
      the officer’s decision to arrest the person who fired the gun.  </span></p>

      profiling may be the product of overt, subconscious, or institutional racial
      bias.  An individual police officer engaged in racial profiling may be
      subjectively unaware that he or she is doing so: see <i>R. v. Brown</i>, <i>supra</i>,
      at para. 8.  Indeed, racial profiling does not necessarily reflect any
      racial bias.  It may reflect the officer’s legitimate perception of the
      reality of the world in which the officer operates: see <i>R. v. Singh</i> (2003),
      15 C.R. (6th) 288 at para. 18 (Ont. S.C.J.).  Regardless of the connection,
      if any, between racial profiling and racial bias, racial profiling cannot
      be tolerated.  It is offensive to fundamental concepts of equality and
      the human dignity of those who are subject to negative stereotyping.  It
      fuels negative and destructive racial stereotyping of those who are subjected
      to profiling.  Racial profiling will also ultimately undermine effective
      policing both by misdirecting valuable and limited resources and by alienating

      by the courts that racial profiling occurs and is a day-to-day reality
      in the lives of those minorities affected by it.  Indeed, as the evidence
      in this case indicates, police forces, including the Board, acknowledge

lang=EN-US>The appellants joined by the ACLC advanced essentially a three-pronged
      attack on the trial judge’s findings that the appellants were not the victims
      of racial profiling.  They submit first, that the factual findings underlying
      that conclusion were unreasonable;  second, that the factual findings reflect
      a failure to properly appreciate and apply Dr. Agard’s evidence; and third,
      that the trial judge did not follow the approach dictated in <i>R. v. Brown</i>, <i>supra</i>,
      in assessing the racial profiling issue.  The ACLC also argues that the
      trial judge erred in placing the burden of proof for the issue of racial
      profiling on the appellants.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Before I turn to the reasonableness of the trial judge’s findings,
      I will address a standard of review argument made by the ACLC.  It argues
      that because fundamental <i>Charter</i> rights are involved when racial
      profiling is alleged, appellate courts must engage in “strict evidentiary
      scrutiny” to prevent <i>Charter</i> violations.  The ACLC contends that
      the usual deference owed to fact-finding cannot be shown where the fact-finding
      relates to fundamental <i>Charter</i> rights.  No authority is cited for
      this proposition.  There is high authority to the contrary.  In <i>Housen
      v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at para. 25, the majority said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>We conclude,
    therefore, by emphasizing that there is one, and only one, standard of review
    applicable to all factual conclusions made by the trial judge – that of palpable

lang=EN-US>The submission made by the ACLC assumes that findings of fact relating
      to <i>Charter</i> rights are intrinsically more important than other kinds
      of factual findings.  The submission also assumes that the importance of
      factual findings renders a non-deferential approach to appellate review
      of those findings appropriate.  Both assumptions are wrong.  Findings of
      fact relating to <i>Charter</i> claims are not inherently more important
      than all other findings of fact.  The significance of a finding of fact
      depends on the context in which it is made.  Furthermore, even if one assumes
      that fact-finding is hierarchical and that <i>Charter</i> facts are at
      the top of that hierarchy, I cannot accept that a higher level of appellate
      scrutiny would inevitably improve the overall reliability of the fact-finding
      process as it relates to the <i>Charter</i>.  To the contrary, appellate
      deference to trial judges’ findings of fact is predicated in part on the
      realization that close appellate scrutiny of the fact-finding process does
      not improve the reliability of that process, but may have the opposite
      effect.  </span></p>

      interfere with any individual rights.  Officer Ceballo’s decision to run
      a computer check on the licence plate did not interfere with any of the
      appellants’ rights.  If, as he testified, Officer Ceballo ran the computer
      check essentially because he had time to do so, there was nothing wrong

lang=EN-US>The essential question was not whether Officer Ceballo had reasonable
      grounds to suspect the appellants of any misconduct when he conducted the
      computer check, but whether he was motivated to do so in part, at least,
      because of the colour of the appellants’ skin.  The answer to that question
      turned in part on Officer Ceballo’s credibility.  The trial judge ultimately
      concluded that he was credible and believed his evidence.  I cannot accept
      the submission that it was unreasonable for the trial judge to believe
      Officer Ceballo.  He explained that he routinely conducted computer checks
      on licence plates when he had time to do so, particularly at night.  He
      added that Honda Preludes were of particular interest because they were
      a target for car thieves.  This evidence was not contradicted.  In fact,
      it was confirmed to some extent by evidence from other officers of their
      routine practice.  There is also nothing inherently improbable in Officer
      Ceballo’s evidence.  Even if I were to accept that other triers of fact
      may not have believed Officer Ceballo, that would offer no basis upon which
      to characterize the trial judge’s acceptance of Officer Ceballo’s evidence
      on this point as unreasonable.  </span></p>

      Ceballo was not engaged in racial profiling is rendered unreasonable by

lang=EN-US>Speeding can be a pretext for a racially motivated stop: see <i>R.
        v. Brown</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 48.  Whether it is a pretext will
        depend on the findings of fact in each case.  For example, if as Mr.
        Peart testified he was travelling at ten to twenty kilometres over the
        speed limit at 3:30 in the morning when Officer Ceballo began to follow
        him, it would be open for a trial judge to find that Peart’s excessive
        speed was a pretext for the officer following his vehicle.  Unfortunately
        for the appellants, the trial judge did not believe Mr. Peart.  He accepted
        Officer Ceballo’s evidence that the Peart vehicle pulled out of the gas
        station at a high rate of speed and quickly achieved speeds which Officer
        Ceballo estimated at well over 100 kilometres per hour.  On Officer Ceballo’s
        version of the events, it is hardly unreasonable to conclude that the
        speed of the appellants’ vehicle was what attracted Officer Ceballo’s
        attention and caused him to pursue the vehicle.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>It was open to the trial judge to accept Officer Ceballo’s testimony
      concerning the speed of the appellants’ vehicle.  It was supported to some
      extent by Officer Ceballo’s notes and by other officers who testified about
      their communications with Officer Ceballo when he was chasing the appellants’ vehicle.  Officer
      Ceballo’s evidence was also supported by Mr. Grant’s testimony.  Mr. Grant
      testified that he was accustomed to Mr. Peart driving well above the speed
      limit.  Mr. Grant also testified that Mr. Peart’s speed sufficiently concerned
      him that he asked Mr. Peart why he was driving the way he was.  The trial
      judge found that Mr. Grant’s reaction to Mr. Peart’s driving supported
      the inference that Mr. Peart was driving at a speed well above the speed
      at which he normally drove his vehicle.  Finally, Mr. Peart’s own evidence
      that he fled as soon as he realized he was being followed by Officer Ceballo
      offers some further support for Officer Ceballo’s evidence concerning the
      speed of Mr. Peart’s vehicle.  Officer Ceballo’s evidence describing the
      way the vehicle pulled away from the gas station is consistent with a vehicle
      that is being driven by someone who had just seen Officer Ceballo’s car
      across the road and who had a paranoid fear of the police.    </span></p>

      to the trial judge’s acceptance of Officer Ceballo’s evidence.  The appellants
      contend that the trial judge acted unreasonably in failing to reject Officer

lang=EN-US>Where racial profiling is alleged, evidence that the police officer
      involved attempted to mislead the court as to when he realized that the
      driver of the vehicle was black can support the racial profiling allegation.  It
      may provide important insight into the truthfulness of the explanation
      for the stop offered by the police officer and can be construed as akin
      to an implied admission by the officer of the significance of race to his
      or her decision to stop the vehicle.  However, evidence that a police officer
      has misled the court as to when he or she realized the individual stopped
      was black is not a precondition to a finding of racial profiling, and is
      not necessarily conclusive on the issue.  Its significance in any particular

      had tried to mislead him as to when he first appreciated that the occupants
      of the vehicle were black.  The trial judge considered this argument and
      accurately summarized the relevant evidence at paras. 37-40.  He observed
      that the officer’s notes, made shortly after the incident, clearly suggested
      that Officer Ceballo was aware that the appellants were black before they
      exited the vehicle at the gas station.  Officer Ceballo’s testimony at
      discovery was consistent with his notes.  In his examination-in-chief,
      several years after the incident, Officer Ceballo testified that he was
      unsure whether he knew that the appellants were black before they exited
      the vehicle at the gas station.  In cross-examination, after he was referred
      to his evidence on discovery, Officer Ceballo agreed that it was fair to
      conclude that he knew that the occupants of the car were black before they
      exited the vehicle.</span></p>

      his examination-in-chief, and his cross-examination.  Considering his testimony
      and the contents of his notes, it was not unreasonable for the trial judge
      to conclude that Officer Ceballo’s professed uncertainty during examination-in-chief
      as to when he realized the appellants were black was genuine and not an
      attempt to mislead the court on that issue.  Both the contents of the notes

      racial profiling claim arises out of the evidence that, subsequent to the
      arrest of the appellants, the officers questioned the appellants about
      guns and drugs and caused a search for drugs or guns to be made of the
      area around the gas station.  The appellants submit that there was no evidence

lang=EN-US>This argument was made at trial and rejected by the trial judge at
      paras. 112-14.  The trial judge concluded that the police had reasonable
      cause to believe that the appellants were engaged in criminal activity
      because they sped away when they apparently saw Officer Ceballo’s vehicle,
      did not stop when he activated his siren and lights, and drove in a reckless
      and dangerous manner in an attempt to get away from Officer Ceballo.  The
      trial judge said at para. 114:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The police were
    not simply dealing with two black men out for a drive where asking such questions
    [<i>i.e.</i>, questions about guns and drugs] could well show stereotyping.  They
    were dealing with two men who, for no apparent reason, fled from them.  People
    who flee from the police usually have some reason to do so; often a criminal
    reason.  Inquiries, even very pointed inquiries, into the reason do not demonstrate
    racial prejudice or stereotyping.</p>

lang=EN-US>On the facts found by the trial judge, police concerns about the possible
      involvement of drugs and guns, and the decision to send someone back to
      the gas station to investigate, grew out of the specific circumstances
      confronting the police and not any preconceived notions based on race.  In
      making the findings set out above, the trial judge did not misapprehend
      any of the relevant evidence.  His conclusion that the circumstances warranted
      concerns by the officers that there may be evidence of criminal activity
      at the gas station was not unreasonable.  Those concerns, whether they
      reach the level of reasonable suspicion or not, justified the police decision

lang=EN-US>The fifth allegation of unreasonableness in the fact finding process
      that led the trial judge to reject the racial profiling claim concerns
      the trial judge’s treatment of the evidence of Mr. Peart’s flight from
      Officer Ceballo.  The appellants submit that Mr. Peart fled because, like
      many young black men, his prior experiences with the police caused him
      to fear and mistrust them.  The appellants argue that the trial judge’s
      finding that Mr. Peart’s flight justified the police pursuit and subsequent
      high-risk takedown and arrest is unreasonable because it failed to consider
      that flight from “the perspective of the racialized Black man in relation

lang=EN-US>One of the crucial questions for the trial judge was why Officer Ceballo
      followed the appellants’ vehicle when it left the gas station.  If the
      vehicle drove as described by Officer Ceballo, there was ample reason for
      him to pursue.  The trial judge accepted Dr. Agard’s evidence that Mr.
      Peart’s flight was caused by his fear of the police and his desire to get
      to his home where he felt he would be safe if stopped by the police.  However,
      in the trial judge’s assessment, this evidence did not help the appellants,
      but tended to confirm Officer Ceballo’s description of the way Mr. Peart
      drove the vehicle.  The trial judge found, and there was no evidence to
      the contrary, that Officer Ceballo had no reason to believe Mr. Peart was
      driving towards his home since the vehicle was registered to a place in
      Downsview.  From Officer Ceballo’s perspective, the vehicle was in flight
      from the police, proceeding in a dangerous manner, and headed for some
      unknown destination.  Whatever caused Mr. Peart to drive as he did was
      irrelevant to the danger it posed and to Officer Ceballo’s decision to
      pursue and stop the vehicle.  </span></p>

      Mr. Peart’s fear of the police.  He accepted this evidence and accepted
      that Mr. Peart’s fear played a significant role in his conduct.  The trial
      judge further concluded, however, that far from supporting the appellants’ racial
      profiling claim, the evidence of Mr. Peart’s mental state was consistent

      shifting of the legal burden occurs in cases where the accused alleges
      an unreasonable search or seizure.  If the accused demonstrates that the

      effective pursuit of criminal investigations and individual rights to personal

      remains on the appellants, in any given case there may well be a significant
      tactical burden on the defendant to introduce evidence negating the inference

      medical malpractice case in these terms:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><u>In many malpractice

    is a matter of weighing evidence.  <u>The defendant runs the risk of an adverse
    inference in the absence of evidence to the contrary.</u>  This is sometimes
    referred to as imposing on the defendant a provisional or tactical burden.  …  In

      juror.  A perspective juror is presumed impartial unless the parties seeking
      to challenge for cause can demonstrate a reasonable possibility of partiality.  The
      Supreme Court in <i>R. v. Williams</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 32, held
      that in assessing whether a reasonable possibility of partiality is established,
      the trial judge should take a generous approach so as to avoid unduly restricting
      access to challenges for cause: <i>R. v. Williams</i> goes on to hold that
      this generous approach can include taking judicial notice of widespread
      racism within the community.  It must be stressed, however, that at this
      first stage, a trial judge is not asked to make any findings of bias or
      partiality.  The trial judge is deciding only whether the circumstances
      warrant an inquiry into partiality.    </span></p>

      if the judge decides there is a reasonable possibility of partiality, the
      triers of the challenge for cause must decide whether the juror is acceptable
      or not acceptable.  They make this decision based on the evidence adduced
      before them.  Usually that evidence consists of the prospective juror’s
      answers to certain agreed upon questions.  At this second stage, where
      the prospective juror’s partiality is decided, there is no presumption
      of impartiality based on the existence of widespread racial bias in the
      community: see <i>R. v. Hubbert</i> (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 279 at 294 (Ont.

      a particular individual is biased on account of race, and quite another
      to use judicial notice to presume that an individual is racially biased
      unless he or she proves otherwise.    </span></p>

      findings are particularly resistant to reversal on appeal: <i>Waxman v.
      Waxman</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paras. 359-60, <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, <i>supra</i>,
      at paras. 23-24.  Detailed reasons that display a strong grasp of the evidence
      and arguments and offer a full explanation for the findings of fact require
      appellants who seek to reverse those findings to point to clear and significant
      errors in the fact finding process articulated in those reasons: <i>Waxman

lang=EN-US>Deference to fact finding at trial is a cornerstone of contemporary
      appellate judicial philosophy.  The proper description of the level of
      deference to be afforded fact finding, particularly fact finding based
      on inferences drawn from primary facts, has been the subject of some controversy:
      see the majority and dissenting opinions in <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, <i>supra</i>.  In <i>Waxman
      v. Waxman</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paras. 301-306, this court articulated
      its interpretation of the majority view in <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i> as
      it related to the review of inferences drawn from primary facts.  The analysis
      in <i>Waxman v. Waxman</i> has been overtaken by the judgment in <i>H.L.
      v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 101.  Fish J., for the
      majority at para. 56, described the standard of review applicable to findings
      of fact in these terms:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[I]t seems to
    me that unreasonable findings of fact – relating to credibility, to primary

    appeal because they are “palpably” or “clearly” wrong.  The same is true
    of findings that are unsupported by the evidence.  I need hardly repeat,
    however, that appellate intervention will only be warranted where the court
    can explain <u>why</u> or <u>in what respect</u>  the impugned finding is

      amount to a palpable and overriding error.  I will not address each and

lang=EN-US>Several of the submissions made in support of the factual challenges
      advanced by the appellants misconceive the nature of appellate review of
      findings of fact.  In his factum, counsel for the appellants refers to
      the existence of ample evidence to support inferences that were favourable
      to the appellants.  I can accept that there was ample evidence to support
      at least some of the factual assertions made by the appellants at trial.  The
      existence of sufficient evidence to support the position advanced by the
      appellants does not, however, render a finding of fact in favour of the
      respondents unreasonable.  The issue is not whether there was evidence
      to support the appellants’ position at trial, but whether the finding in
      favour of the respondents was unreasonable.  The two inquiries are very
      different.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>A second fundamental problem with many of the appellants’ factual
      arguments is that they proceed from the premise that the version of events
      provided by the appellants at trial is reliable and accurate.  The appellants
      argue that the findings of fact made by the trial judge are unreasonable
      when viewed from the perspective of the appellants’ version of the relevant
      events.  This approach ignores the trial judge’s credibility assessments.  He
      found that the appellants were not credible on most material issues.  His
      credibility assessments must stand unless they are shown to be the product
      of clear and palpable error.  The reasonableness of the trial judge’s findings
      of fact must be assessed in light of his credibility assessments unless
      and until those determinations are set aside.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Several of the appellants’ submissions alleging unreasonable findings
      of fact are framed in terms of the trial judge’s failure to consider relevant
      evidence.  My review of the reasons satisfies me that the factors that
      the appellants contend the trial judge ignored were considered by him.  For
      example, contrary to the appellants’ contention the trial judge did give
      express consideration to the officers’ failure to take detailed notes and
      their failure to comply with certain internal police directives.  The trial
      judge recognized that these factors were relevant to the credibility of
      the officers.  It was up to him to decide what weight to give to these
      factors.  His failure to give them the weight that the appellants think
      he should have given them is not a clear and palpable error. </span></p>

      the appellant must demonstrate both that the trial judge misapprehended
      the evidence and that the misapprehension was material to a significant
      finding of fact.  On my review of the record, the appellants have not shown
      any misapprehension of the evidence by the trial judge.  I will refer to

      takedown was justified under police protocol where occupants of a vehicle
      were believed on reasonable grounds to possess weapons or were considered
      dangerous.  I have reviewed the evidence of the expert and her report.  The
      trial judge accurately summarized her evidence.  She testified that a reasonable
      belief that the occupants of a vehicle possessed weapons or were considered

      at para. 64.  He referred to the same legal authority relied on by the
      appellants on appeal.  The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the
      police had no reason to believe that the tapes of the conversations between
      Officer Ceballo and the dispatcher would be relevant to the complaints
      initially made against them by the appellants.  These initial complaints
      related to the police conduct after the arrest and not to the events leading
      to the arrest.  The trial judge did not misapprehend the substance of this
      evidence, but rejected the appellants’ submission that the police ought
      to have known of the relevance of the tapes when they were destroyed.  It
      was open to the trial judge to take that view of the evidence.  </span></p>

      place a phone call to a drug dealer while Mr. Peart was in Officer Pedler’s
      custody on the morning of December 1.  The appellants submit that the phone
      records show that a call was made while Mr. Peart was in police custody
      at the police station.  They contend that the records prove that Officer
      Pedler lied when he denied that he caused Mr. Peart to place a phone call

lang=EN-US>As with virtually all of the factual arguments advanced by the appellants
      on appeal, this argument was made to the trial judge and dealt with by
      him in his reasons at para. 159.  The trial judge was satisfied that Mr.
      Peart placed the call while in custody on the morning of December 1.  He
      reviewed Mr. Peart’s evidence on the point and concluded that because of
      the inconsistencies in that evidence, he could not be satisfied whether
      it was Officer Pedler or Officer Ceballo that asked Mr. Peart to place
      the phone call.  The trial judge’s summary of Mr. Peart’s evidence is accurate.  It
      was open to him based on the inconsistencies in Mr. Peart’s evidence to
      be left uncertain as to which officer was involved in the making of the
      phone call.  Consequently, the appellants are wrong when they argue that
      the trial judge misapprehended the evidence when he failed to find that
      Officer Pedler’s evidence on the point was proven to be false.  </span></p>

      was common ground that some weeks after December 1, Officer Pedler stopped
      Mr. Peart when he was driving his motor vehicle.  Mr. Peart described this
      stop as part of an ongoing course of harassment of him by the police after

      consistent with the injuries having been inflicted during the high-risk
      takedown or when Mr. Grant was pushed against the wall during the search.  He
      further held that parts of the descriptions of the injuries provided by
      Mr. Grant and Mr. Peart to various doctors tended to support the respondents’ version

      there would be no reason for Mr. Peart to deny being strip searched by
      the police if he was strip searched.  Counsel argues that Mr. Peart’s denial

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Peart’s
    motivation in denying that a strip search occurred is a mystery, unless,

    books, which gives some support to their version, whereas Mr. Peart must
