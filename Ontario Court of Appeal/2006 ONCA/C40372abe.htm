  <h2>APPEAL&nbsp;BOOK ENDORSEMENT</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction on the grounds that the
    trial judge erred in finding that the appellant’s rights pursuant to s.&nbsp;8
    of the <i>Charter</i> were not violated by the search of his motor vehicle and
    failing to exclude the evidence found in the search pursuant to s.&nbsp;24(2)
    of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the trial Crown conceded the s.&nbsp;8 violation at
    the trial, we are inclined to agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that the
    search of the appellant’s vehicle was a lawful search incident to arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, in our view the trial judge’s decision to admit
    the evidence obtained from the search, including a semi&#8209;automatic
    handgun, flowed from a proper application of factors relating to s.&nbsp;24(2)
    of the <i>Charter</i>:  See <i>R. v.
    Collins</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant concedes that the evidence obtained through the
    search was not conscriptive and, therefore, did not affect trial fairness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if the search constituted a violation of s.&nbsp;8 of the <i>Charter</i>, we agree with the trial judge that it was not a serious violation.  The privacy expectation in relation to a
    vehicle is a reduced one: see <i>R. v. Belnavis</i> (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 405
    (S.C.C.).  In this case, it is reduced
    even further by the fact that in relation to the offence with which the
    appellant was initially charged, dangerous driving, the appellant gave the
    police an alibi –namely, the vehicle had been car&#8209;jacked at the relevant
    time – which would obviously compel the police to find and examine the
    car.  In addition, the trial judge found
    that the police conduct leading to the initial search was done in good
    faith.  In our view, his analysis on
    this point was fair and balanced.  Finally, once the police discovered a firearm during the initial
    warrantless search, they immediately halted the search, secured the vehicle,
    and sought and obtained a search warrant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the third <i>Collins</i> factor, we cannot disagree with
    the trial judge’s conclusion that exclusion of the evidence obtained in the
    search would bring the administration of justice into dispute.  The offences with which the appellant was
    charged – possession of a restricted weapon (which, by the way, was concealed
    and loaded), contrary to a firearms prohibition order, and in breach of two
    probation orders – are very serious offences.  Moreover, the evidence was entirely reliable and it was crucial to the
    Crown’s case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
