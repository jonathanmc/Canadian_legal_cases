    appellant appeals from his convictions for sexual assault and unlawful confinement
    following a trial before Klowak J. sitting with a jury.  The appellant was
    tried together with his co-accused, Adrian Samuels.  Mr. Samuels was found
    not guilty by the jury of both charges.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three issues on appeal.  First, the appellant contends that
    the trial judge erred in law by exhorting the jury when the jury had given
    no indication that they were deadlocked.  The second issue raised by the
    appellant is that the verdict of guilty in his case and that of not guilty
    in the case of his co-accused are inconsistent and therefore unreasonable.  The
    third issue raised relates to the trial judge’s instructions to the jury
    concerning the issue of recent complaint.  For the reasons that follow we
    would dismiss the appeal.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    part of this ground, the appellant refers to portions of the exhortation
    and contends that, in the circumstances of this particular case, these portions
    of the exhortation, together with the fact that the exhortation was not warranted,
    created the impression of a deadline and placed undue pressure on the jury
    to reach a verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject this submission.  While we agree that it would have been preferable
    had the trial judge not exhorted the jury when she did, no authorities were
    cited establishing that it is an error in law to exhort a jury absent an
    indication that the jury is deadlocked or having difficulty.  In our view,
    the real issue in this case is whether there is any reasonable possibility
    that the exhortation that was given “coerced the jury or interfered with
    its right to deliberate in complete freedom from extraneous considerations
    or pressures, or caused a juror to concur with a view that he or she did
    not truly hold”: see <i>R. v. G.(R.M.) </i>(1996), 110C.C.C. (3d) 26 at para.
    50 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    our review of the exhortation and the record in this case, we conclude that
    there is no such reasonable possibility.  At approximately 8:50 p.m. on the
    evening before the exhortation was given, the trial judge invited the jury
    to cease deliberations and go to a hotel for the night.  The jury responded
    by “strongly” requesting an additional two hours to continue deliberating,
    stating that the members were all focussed, the evidence was fresh in their
    minds and that they had collectively agreed upon it.  Having reviewed the
    jury’s request with counsel, the trial judge recalled the jury and stated: “…[D]on’t
    feel that I am pushing you to make a decision, I am not.  You should not
    feel rushed, it is obviously an important matter and you should not feel
    rushed or pushed or pressed.”  The deliberations continued that evening until
    about 11 p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    exhorting the jury at 10 a.m. on the second day of deliberations,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> the trial judge explicitly
    said, “I am not speaking to you at this time in an effort to try and rush
    you or anything and please don’t take my comments to you in that regard.”  Following
    the exhortation the jury continued to deliberate.  They asked a further question
    at about 11&nbsp;a.m.  Although the record does not indicate when the verdict
    was returned, according to the recollection of trial counsel for the appellant
    and the co-accused, the verdict was returned either around 1 p.m. or early
    afternoon. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, the suggestion that the jury may have felt pressured
    or rushed is not made out.  The trial judge specifically instructed the jury
    not to feel pressured or rushed.  In the face of this instruction, counsel’s
    submissions of what the jury might have taken from isolated passages in the
    exhortation are speculative. Moreover, this jury had clearly indicated that
    it would proceed on its own schedule; it continued to deliberate and asked
    a question following the exhortation. </p>

    order to appreciate this ground of appeal it is necessary to review briefly
    the evidence at trial.  The female complainant was fourteen years old at
    the time of the incident forming the subject matter of the charges.  Both
    co-accused were nineteen.  The appellant, the co-accused and the complainant
    attended the same high school.  The incident began at a coffee shop near
    the high school and across the road from the co-accused’s house.  According
    to the complainant, the appellant approached her and asked to speak to her
    outside.  Once outside, the appellant indicated that he would like to introduce
    her to his friend and that his friend had expressed an interest in her.  She
    agreed, and they walked together to Mr. Samuels’ house across the street. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that they went to the back door of Mr. Samuels’ home
    where Mr. Samuels was waiting.  Mr. Samuels pulled her into the house.  Almost
    immediately, the appellant threw her over his shoulder and carried her upstairs
    to a bedroom.  Mr. Samuels followed.  The appellant threw the complainant
    onto a bed in the bedroom.  With Mr. Samuels holding her hands above her
    head, the appellant took off her clothes and proceeded to have forced sexual
    intercourse with her.  When the appellant finished, he held the complainant’s
    hands.  Mr. Samuels then had forced sexual intercourse with her.  Mr. Samuels
    was wearing a condom.  Throughout this period, the complainant was resisting
    and attempting to fight off her attackers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    Mr. Samuels was finished, he left the bedroom.  The complainant asked the
    appellant why he had done this to her.  In response, the appellant pushed
    her back onto the bed and had forced sexual intercourse with her a second
    time.  After threatening her and telling her not to tell anyone, the appellant
    left the bedroom.  Soon afterwards, the complainant got dressed, left Mr.
    Samuels’ home and went back to school.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence of the appellant and his co-accused differed significantly from
    that of the complainant.  According to the appellant, once they stepped out
    of the coffee shop, he asked the complainant if she knew Mr. Samuels and
    if she considered him hot.  The complainant answered
    “maybe”.  The two of them then walked over to Mr. Samuels’ house.  Once there,
    they let themselves in and sat on a couch in the lower level.  Mr. Samuels
    joined them.  The threesome watched television for at least one half hour
    and drank alcohol from a bottle that the complainant had supplied.  The complainant
    also took an anti-depressant.  Later, the appellant asked Mr. Samuels if
    he could use Mr.&nbsp;Samuels’ bedroom because he wanted to have sexual intercourse
    with the complainant. Mr. Samuels agreed, and the appellant and the complainant
    went upstairs to Mr. Samuels’ bedroom.  Once in the bedroom, the two talked
    for about five minutes prior to having consensual sexual intercourse.  When
    they were finished, the appellant told the complainant to wait.  He wanted
    Mr. Samuels to have intercourse with the complainant as well. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant got dressed and went downstairs.  Mr. Samuels went upstairs and
    the appellant waited downstairs.  After a while, when he did not hear anything,
    the appellant went upstairs, opened the bedroom door and saw Mr. Samuels
    and the complainant sitting on the bed talking.  The appellant shut the door
    and sat on the top step of the stairs.  Mr. Samuels came out of the bedroom
    and asked the appellant to go downstairs, which he did.  After about ten
    minutes the appellant heard footsteps.  He went back upstairs because he
    wanted to have intercourse with the complainant again.  As the appellant
    came upstairs, Mr. Samuels came out of the bedroom.  The two men did not
    speak.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant went into the bedroom as the complainant was getting dressed.  He
    and the complainant had consensual sexual intercourse a second time.  They
    then got dressed and walked downstairs together. The complainant returned
    to school, and the appellant stayed in the basement for a while.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Samuels evidence was substantially the same as the appellant’s.  In addition
    to confirming material aspects of the appellant’s evidence, he stated that,
    upon entering the bedroom where the complainant was, he sat and talked with
    her for about a half hour.  The complainant then said if he wanted anything
    to happen he should tell the appellant to go downstairs.  Mr. Samuels testified
    that the complainant opened the bedroom door and he told the appellant to
    go downstairs.  Once the appellant had gone downstairs, Mr. Samuels put on
    a condom and had consensual sexual intercourse with the complainant.  When
    they were finished, Mr. Samuels got dressed, went downstairs and left the
    house.  However, as he left, he observed the appellant go back upstairs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, on this evidence, it was open to the jury to acquit Mr. Samuels
    and to convict the appellant.  In this regard, in <i>R. v. Pittiman</i> 2006
    SCC 9 at para. 10, the Supreme Court of Canada set out the test for determining
    whether verdicts are inconsistent and therefore unreasonable.  The test is
    as follows: “are the verdicts irreconcilable such that no reasonable jury,
    properly instructed, could possibly have rendered them on the evidence?”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    verdict suggests that the jury had a reasonable doubt in respect of Mr.&nbsp;Samuels.  Despite
    that doubt, it was open to the jury to accept the complainant’s evidence
    concerning the appellant’s second act of intercourse, reject the appellant’s
    evidence on that issue and conclude that it did not raise a reasonable doubt.  On
    this theory of the evidence, the jury could convict the appellant in relation
    to his second act of intercourse with the complainant and the period of confinement
    associated with it.  Further, this conclusion would be consistent with the
    evidence of Mr. Samuels that the appellant returned to the bedroom after
    Mr. Samuels went downstairs.  The test in <i>Pittiman</i> is therefore met.</p>

line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s instruction was as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>I want to deal briefly with complaint.  There is no requirement
    in our law that the prosecution prove that [the complainant] complain to
    someone about the accused’s conduct.  Complaint is not an essential ingredient
    of the offence before you and you are not here to try her on whether or not
    she complained to anybody about the accused’s conduct.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>You may however, and again it is up to you, consider evidence of complaint
    or lack of complaint and any explanations along with it, along with all of
    the other evidence which you accept in assessing her credibility and in determining
    whether or not the prosecution has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  I
    want to tell you very clearly that complaint is not evidence of the facts
    complained of.  In other words if you accept that she complained to the vice
    principal for example, it is not evidence that the incident occurred or that
    the details she gave, any one of them, are true.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>The fact of the complaint and the particulars of it can be used only for
    the purposes of enabling you to judge for yourself whether her conduct was
    consistent with her testimony on oath given in the witness box before you
    and to assist you in determining whether her conduct was such as you would
    expect in a truthful witness under the circumstances related by her.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>In other words, complaint or lack of complaint and any explanations for
    it can only be used by you in considering her credibility and for no other
    purpose.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>With respect
    to evidence of complaint, it includes the evidence relating to the circumstances
    of her telling the vice principal when she returned to the school, I will
    look over that with you.  She says she did not tell her friends about it.  When
    they called her after and her explanation was that she did not want them
    to know about her business.  Now it is up to you to consider the evidence
    with respect to complaint or lack of complaint and any explanations along
    with all of the other evidence in assessing her credibility and in determining
    whether or not the prosecution has proved the guilt of each accused beyond
    a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, defence counsel for the two accused mounted a substantial attack on
    the complainant’s credibility based on the timing and circumstances of her
    complaint </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specifically,
    in his closing submissions, one of defence counsel cited the complainant’s
    failure to tell her friends about the incident when, after the event, four
    of these friends called her.  He also raised the fact that the complainant
    went back to school after the incident rather than contact the police or
    her father.  When she was brought to the vice-principal’s office for not
    having gone to her noon-time detention, she first told the vice-principal
    that she had forgotten about it before reporting the alleged assault.  Defence
    counsel also suggested that, by telling the vice-principal that she did not
    want the police involved, the jury should conclude that the sexual intercourse
    had been consensual.</p>

    85 C.C.C. (3d) 457 (C.A.).  In that case, the statements regarding the complaint
    were admitted as being a part of the narrative.  At p. 476, Finlayson J.A.,
    speaking for the court, dealt with the use that could be made of the statements
    as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The fact that
    the statements were made is admissible to assist the jury as to the sequence
    of events from the alleged offence to the prosecution so that they can understand
    the conduct of the complainant and assess her truthfulness.  However, the
    jury must be instructed that they are not to look to the content of the statements
    as proof that a crime has been committed.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant does not suggest that the statements respecting the complaints
    ought not to have been admitted.  Rather, he submits that evidence of prior
    complaint can only be used in assessing credibility to the limited extent
    of dispelling allegations of recent fabrication.  No such allegation was
    made in this case.  Rather than give a clear limiting instruction, the trial
    judge gave the opposite of a limiting instruction, telling the jury repeatedly
    that they could use the complainant’s prior consistent statement in assessing
    her credibility. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject the appellant’s submission that the trial judge erred in law in relation
    to this aspect of her instruction.  As we have set out above, the defence
    raised issues respecting the circumstances surrounding the complaint and
    the lack of complaint and argued that these should be taken into account
    and used by the jury to find the complainant incredible.  The complainant
    explained her conduct.  Her evidence and explanation of the circumstances
    surrounding the complaint were matters that the jury could consider in assessing
    credibility.  This part of the charge must, therefore, be read in context.  The
    trial judge quite properly told the jury that they should consider the circumstances
    surrounding the complaint and lack of complaint as well as the explanations
    of the complainant in assessing her credibility.  These are appropriate instructions
    given the position taken by the defence.  As provided in the <i>R. v. F.(J.E.)</i> decision,
    the trial judge then went on to instruct the jury that the complaint and
    any of the details of the complaint were not evidence that the incident had
    in fact occurred.  Although it would have been preferable had the trial judge
    provided the jury with explicit instructions as to how the jury could use
    the evidence of complaint in assessing the complainant’s credibility, we
    do not, in the circumstances of this case, consider that the failure to do
    so constitutes an error.  In particular, we do not think that the jury would
    have been misled into using the evidence of complaint for an improper purpose.  Moreover,
    defence counsel at trial made no objections to the trial judge’s charge.</p>
