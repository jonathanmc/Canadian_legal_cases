  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early in the morning on May 29, 2001, D’Angelo Christie
    (“Christie”) and Lincoln Brown (“Brown”) were kidnapped at gunpoint by two men.
    Christie and Brown had been lured to the parking lot of a nightclub when two
    gunmen appeared. One of the gunmen got into Christie’s car, while the other
    followed behind in a Lexus. The gunman in the car with Christie and Brown
    directed Christie to drive to a parking lot in an industrial area. While they
    were driving, the gunman was speaking on a cell phone headset. It appeared to
    Christie and Brown that he was speaking to the driver of the Lexus. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once in the industrial park, the gunman in the Lexus joined
    the others in Christie’s car. Christie was then asked for money and threatened
    (Brown was not). Christie begged to be driven to his home where he would
    provide the men with money. The gunmen directed Christie to do so. They
    directed him as to which route to take, suggesting that they already knew the
    way to his house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the house, the gunman who had been with Christie the entire
    time, entered the house with Christie. The two came upon Christie’s wife
    (“Giovanna”). The gunman searched for and demanded money that he said was
    “owed” to him. He also stole jewellery from the house. During the search,
    Christie escaped to a neighbour’s house and called 9-1-1. When he realized that
    Christie had escaped, the gunman left the house, returned to Christie’s car
    (where the other gunman and Brown had been waiting), and drove back to the
    industrial park, where they left Brown in Christie’s car and left in the Lexus.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 10, 2001, Clarence Coward (a.k.a. Clarence
    Rogers) was arrested and was found to be in possession of a cell phone that was
    used on the night of the kidnapping and a gun that resembled a gun identified
    by the complainants. On October 19, 2001, the appellant was arrested and was
    found to be in possession of a cell phone bill associated with the cell phone
    that the first gunman’s phone had been calling on the night of the kidnapping.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sole issue at trial was the identification of the
    appellant as the gunman who rode in Christie’s car and who entered his house.
    The defence did not take issue with the fact the offences were committed</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>THE CONVICTION APPEAL</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    foundation of the conviction appeal rests on the fresh evidence application
    before this court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Prior
    to the trial, counsel for the appellant received information that one of the
    complainants, D’Angelo Christie, was using an assumed name and had a criminal
    record. Counsel prepared a pre-trial application to obtain citizenship and
    immigration records from the Government of Canada, and they also subpoenaed
    occurrence reports and other materials from the Toronto Police Service, York
    Regional Police and Peel Regional Police.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    affidavit filed in support of the application was that of the legal assistant
    to trial counsel and was based on information and belief. Paragraph 3 of that
    affidavit stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>3. Mr. McLachlin has advised me that he has been provided
    with hearsay information, the source of which is not verifiable, relating to
    the identity of a Crown witness in this case who calls himself D’Angelo
    Christie. Mr. McLachlin has informed me that the information he was provided is
    that D’Angelo Christie is not the real name of this witness.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>and in paragraph six:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>6. Mr. McLachlin has advised me that he has been
    provided with hearsay information, the source of which is not verifiable, that
    the witness who calls himself D’Angelo Christie was convicted of criminal
    offences in Canada and deported. Mr. McLachlin has informed me that his
    information is that subsequent to this witness’ deportation he met Giovanna
    Christie and returned to Canada under his brother’s name.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial
    counsel also requested that the Crown provide a copy of the finger prints of
    this witness (Christie) to be run through fingerprint data banks available to
    police.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While
    the Crown resisted the appellant’s request as presented, it did obtain D’Angelo
    Christie’s consent to have the police compare his elimination prints (taken
    from his residence after the incident), against the immigration prints taken
    when D’Angelo Christie entered Canada under the name D’Angelo Christie. This
    comparison confirmed that this man was the same man who entered the country
    under the name D’Angelo Christie and who had obtained Canadian citizenship. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Neither
    the appellant nor his counsel provided any further information to the court as
    to the source of the “hearsay information” relied upon. The Crown opposed the
    balance of the application.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    information that was available at the time of trial indicated that the
    complainant had no criminal antecedents and was not using a false name and the
    trial proceeded on that basis.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    complainant was cross-examined at trial and denied any suggestion that he had a
    criminal record and/or was in this country illegally. In re-examination Crown
    counsel then elicited from this witness that he had never been arrested or
    convicted of a criminal offence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Subsequent
    to the appellant’s conviction and sentence, his counsel was able to confirm
    that it was true that the complainant had used many aliases, had a criminal
    record, and had been twice deported from Canada and returned to Canada
    illegally.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant now seeks to have this information admitted as fresh evidence before
    this court. It is argued that this information affects the integrity of the

lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    test for the admission of fresh evidence is well settled:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>1. the
    evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have
    been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied
    as strictly in criminal cases as in civil cases;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>2. the
    evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or
    potentially decisive issue in the trial;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>3. the
    evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief;
    and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>4. it must
    be such that if believed, it could reasonably, when taken with the other
    evidence adduced at the trial, be expected to have affected the result.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In our
    view the appellant fails on both the first and fourth parts of the test.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Even
    in this court in the affidavit of trial counsel filed in support of this
    application, the source of the information in relation to D’Angelo Christie,
    that he was using an assumed name and had a criminal record, is not revealed.
    Although particulars of the aliases used and the particulars of the past
    criminal convictions are detailed, there is nothing that demonstrates that this
    evidence was not available at trial. This is not a case of either advertent or
    inadvertent non-disclosure by the Crown. There having been no misconduct or
    lack of  disclosure on the part of the
    Crown, it cannot be said to be evidence that goes to the fairness or integrity
    of the trial process.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant’s defence was solely based on identification. However, this
    complainant’s evidence was not the only evidence of identification before the
    court. The complainant’s wife also identified the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    addition there was compelling evidence in the form of cell phone records which
    put the appellant in contact with his co-accused at the approximate locations
    where the offences were carried out at about the time they were said to have
    occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    these circumstances we are not persuaded that even had this evidence been
    admitted, it could reasonably be expected to have affected the result.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Counsel
    suggest that had this evidence been available at trial the appellant’s defence
    may well have been different. For example, he could have said he knew the
    victim who owed him money but that there was no violence and that the victim
    had animus against him. However there is no evidence before us from the
    appellant that had this information been admitted at trial, his defence would
    have been any different than the defence he ultimately presented, which was
    based solely on identification. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
