  <p class=headingtitle><b><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      Crown appeals an order made by Hawke J. staying proceedings against the
      respondent pursuant to s. 24(1) of the <em>Charter </em>based on a breach of s.
      9 of the <em>Charter</em>. The trial judge&rsquo;s order arose from the circumstances
      surrounding the respondent&rsquo;s arrest on a charge of robbery. For the
  reasons that follow, we would allow the Crown&rsquo;s appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The respondent was arrested as the
    result of an incident on September 16, 2001, during which a Rogers Video store
    employee was robbed while walking to the bank with the store’s deposit bag. The
    police alleged that the respondent, a fellow employee of the victim, was the
    mastermind of the robbery, but that others actually committed the offence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      respondent was arrested on October 19, 2001, at 7:10 a.m. Following his
      arrest, the police detained the respondent at a police station until October
  20, 2001 at 8:40 a.m. when he was transported to court for a bail hearing. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In </span><span
lang=EN-GB>her reasons, the trial judge concluded that the respondent&rsquo;s
      detention did not comply with s. 503 of the <em>Criminal
      Code</em>. In that regard,
      the trial judge noted that the leading case dealing with the interpretation
      of s. 503 of the <em>Criminal Code </em>is <em>R. v. Koszulap</em> (1975), 20 C.C.C. (2d)
      193 in which this court stated &ldquo;the obligation of the arresting officer
      is to bring the arrested person before a Justice &lsquo;without unreasonable
      delay&rsquo;&hellip;and that 24 hours is the outer limit of what is a reasonable
      period where a Justice is available within that period.&rdquo;  The trial
      judge found that, because the detention exceeded 24 hours and a Justice
      of the Peace could have been accessed up until the end of the first 10
      hours of the period during which he was detained, the respondent&rsquo;s
      detention did not comply with s. 503 of the <em>Criminal
      Code</em> and was therefore
  unlawful.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Based
    on further findings that the arresting officer had a clear goal of obtaining an
    inculpatory statement and detained the respondent in contravention of s. 503 in
    order to achieve that purpose, the trial judge concluded that the respondent's
    detention was arbitrary. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Finally,
    after finding that the respondent's arbitrary detention was &quot;foreseeable,
    deliberate, serious, flagrant and part of an inappropriate course of
    conduct,&quot; the trial judge concluded that the only appropriate remedy was a
    stay of proceedings pursuant to s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Crown raises two issues on appeal.
    We called on the respondent only in relation to the second issue. </span><span
lang=EN-US>Nevertheless, we will</span><span
lang=EN-GB> briefly address the first issue raised by the Crown, namely, that
    on her own findings of fact, the trial judge’s conclusions are, in part,
    unreasonable. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In </span><span
lang=EN-GB></span><span lang=EN-GB>our view, the reasonableness of the trial
      judge&rsquo;s finding concerning the arresting officer&rsquo;s motive for
      continuing to detain the respondent is not undermined by the trial judge&rsquo;s
      failure to advert to the fact that the arresting officer continued to detain
      the respondent after 3 p.m. on October 19, 2001, when the respondent completed
  his inculpatory statement.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In </span><span lang=EN-GB>that
      respect, we agree that the trial judge made findings that the arresting
      officer continued to detain the respondent in order to obtain an inculpatory
      statement and that, by his actions, the arresting officer conveyed a message
      that the respondent would continue to be detained until his attitude changed.
      However, on our reading of the trial judge&rsquo;s reasons, her findings
      were in no way premised on a further conclusion that the arresting officer
      intended to release the respondent promptly once the respondent provided
      an inculpatory statement. In these circumstances, we see no basis for concluding
      that the trial judge&rsquo;s findings are tainted by her failure to advert
  specifically to the respondent&rsquo;s continued detention after 3 p.m.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    part of the first issue,</span><span lang=EN-GB> the Crown also submitted that
    the trial judge blurred the burdens of proof in relation to the voluntariness
    and <i>Charter</i> issues raised on the <i>voir dire</i>. In particular, the
    Crown submitted that the trial judge improperly held that the same evidence
    that fell short of establishing voluntariness was sufficient to establish a <i>Charter</i> breach.  We disagree. In our view, the trial
    judge made clear findings of fact supporting her conclusions on the <i>Charter</i> issues and did not merely rely on the lacunae of evidence she had identified in
    relation to voluntariness.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    second issue raised by the Crown is whether, on the facts of this case, the
    trial judge erred in ordering a stay.  In particular, the Crown submits that even assuming the respondent's s.
    9 <i>Charter</i> rights were breached, the trial judge failed to consider and
    apply the appropriate legal principles in holding that a stay of proceedings
    was warranted. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
    accept the Crown’s submission. </span><span lang=EN-GB>A stay of proceedings is
    a drastic remedy reserved for the “clearest of cases”: <i>R. v. O’Connor</i>,
    [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411 at para. 68.</span><span lang=EN-GB> Whether the wrongful conduct that is in issue causes prejudice to the
    accused because of an unfair trial, or is harmful to the integrity of the
    justice system, a stay of proceeding</span><span lang=EN-GB> is appropriate
    only where the following two criteria are satisfied:</span></p>
  <p style='
vertical-align:middle'><span lang=EN-US><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>the prejudice caused by the breach will be manifested,
    perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial or its outcome; and</span></p>
  <p style='
vertical-align:middle'><span lang=EN-US><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>no other remedy is reasonably capable of removing that
    prejudice: <i>R. v. Regan</i> (2002), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at paras. 53
    and 54. See also <i>R. v.</i> <i>O’Connor</i>, <i>supra</i>, and <i>Canada
    (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    deciding that a stay was the appropriate remedy in the circumstances of this
      case, the trial judge did not refer to any authorities, nor did she articulate
      specifically the test to be applied in deciding whether to grant a stay.
      While the respondent submits that it is implicit in her reasons that the
      trial judge applied the proper test, we are unable to accept that submission.
      On our review of the trial judge&rsquo;s reasons, in deciding to grant
    a stay, she relied on the following factors:</span></p>
  <p style='vertical-align:middle'><span
lang=EN-US>i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>the s. 9 <i>Charter</i> violation was serious and
    flagrant;</span></p>
  <p style='vertical-align:middle'><span
lang=EN-US>ii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>the
      Crown failed to prove that the respondent&rsquo;s statement was voluntary,
      and thus excluding the statement under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter </em>would amount
  to granting no remedy; and</span></p>
  <p style='vertical-align:middle'><span
lang=EN-US>iii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>there
      should be a remedy that would apply regardless of the outcome of the case
      on the merits, and reducing the respondent&rsquo;s sentence in the event
  he was convicted would not be an appropriate remedy.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While
    the findings of the trial judge raise important concerns about the arresting
    officer’s conduct, because the respondent’s statement to the police was
    excluded, there was no possibility that conduct would affect the fairness of
    the respondent’s trial. In our view, in granting a stay of proceedings, the
    trial judge failed to address the fundamental issue of whether</span><span
lang=EN-US> the
    prejudice caused by the breach of the respondent’s s. 9 <i>Charter</i> rights
    would be manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial
    or its outcome.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      particular, the trial judge made no findings indicating that a stay was
      necessary in order to address systemic issues relating to the officer&rsquo;s
      conduct; nor did she explain why the lesser remedy of excluding the respondent&rsquo;s
      statement would not be adequate to address the prejudice that arose from
  the officer&rsquo;s conduct. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      fact that the Crown failed to prove that the respondent&rsquo;s statement
      was voluntary and that it would therefore be excluded in any event, does
      not compel a finding that exclusion of the statement is not an adequate
      remedy. This is because the issue in question is not punishment of the
      police; rather, it is whether the prejudice caused by the breach of the
      respondent&rsquo;s s. 9<em> Charter</em> rights can be adequately addressed by a
      lesser remedy than a stay. On our review of the record and the trial judge&rsquo;s
      findings, we see no basis for concluding that the exclusion of the respondent&rsquo;s
      statement under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em> was not an adequate remedy to address
  the prejudice arising from the breach of the respondent's rights.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the trial
    judge’s order that a stay of proceedings be granted is set aside.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      the conclusion of oral submissions, we requested written submissions on
      the subject of whether, in the event we decided to set aside the stay,
      it was appropriate to remit the matter to the original trial judge to continue
      the trial. That issue was left open by this court in <em>R.
      v. Allen</em>, [1996]
      O.J. No. 3175 aff&rsquo;d [1997] 3 S.C.R. 700. In its written submissions,
      the Crown contends that subsequent authorities have made it clear that
      an order directing that the original trial judge continue the trial is
      not an available option. Having considered this matter further, given the
      length of time that has passed between the trial judge&rsquo;s order and
      the hearing of this appeal, we conclude that the appropriate order is simply
      to direct a new trial in which the respondent&rsquo;s statement to the
  police shall be excluded. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As part of his written submissions, the respondent
    requested that in the event we ordered a new trial without directing that this
    matter be returned to the original trial judge, we make a further order
    striking his election for a trial before a provincial court judge. He relies,
    by analogy, on s. 686(5) of the<i> Criminal Code</i>, which provides that if an
    accused in his notice of appeal requests that any new trial be before a judge
    and jury, the new trial shall be held accordingly. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We decline to make the order requested. As already
    noted, the respondent’s argument is premised on an analogy to the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> provisions dealing with appeals by an accused person. Assuming,
    without deciding, that this court would have the authority on a Crown appeal to
    direct, if requested by the accused, that any new trial be by judge and jury,
    we are not persuaded that such power would extend to simply striking the
