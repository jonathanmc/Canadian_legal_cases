  <p class=MsoBodyText2>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Archie
    G. Campbell of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated
    February 28, 2003.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>CRONK
    J.A.:</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the early morning hours of April 21, 2001,
    eighteen-year-old George Ellison was fatally shot at an after-hours nightclub
    on Dufferin Street in Toronto.  In the
    confusion that followed, the shooter escaped.  Approximately ten days later, the appellant Leucherin Blackman was
    arrested and charged with Ellison’s murder.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only issue at trial was the identification of the
    shooter.  On the Crown’s theory, the
    appellant killed Ellison in revenge for an incident on July 21, 2000 at a
    sports bar when Ellison stabbed the appellant for refusing to pay a debt
    arising from a pool game.  According to
    the Crown, the appellant sought to avenge this stabbing by participating,
    together with two other men, in an incident on February 16, 2001, when Ellison
    was shot and grazed in the head by a bullet fired outside the House of
    Lancaster, a strip club in Toronto.  The
    Crown maintained that when Ellison survived this attack, the appellant
    retaliated for the stabbing by murdering Ellison at the nightclub two months
    later. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of this theory, the Crown relied primarily on an
    eyewitness’s identification of the appellant as the shooter at the
    nightclub.  The Crown also led
    circumstantial evidence of motive.  Following a pre-trial <i>voir dire</i>, evidence was admitted at trial
    of out-of-court statements allegedly made by Ellison to his mother, which the
    Crown argued established a motive for the revenge killing by both implicating
    Ellison as the person who stabbed the appellant and the appellant as one of
    three persons involved in Ellison’s shooting outside the strip club.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not testify at trial.  On February 28, 2003, following a thirty-day
    trial before a judge and jury, he was convicted of first degree murder.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment, without
    the possibility of parole for twenty-five years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction.  He argues that the trial judge erred by
    failing to instruct the jury on eyewitness identification evidence in
    accordance with <i>Chartier v. Quebec (A.G.)</i> (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 34
    (S.C.C.).  He also submits that the
    trial judge erred by admitting the evidence of Ellison’s out-of-court
    statements and, having admitted this evidence, by then providing flawed
    instructions to the jury regarding its assessment of this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I consider that a ‘<i>Chartier</i> instruction’ was not re-quired in this case.  I also conclude that the evidence of Ellison’s out-of-court statements
    was admissible under the principled exception to the hearsay rule.  Finally, I see no error in the trial judge’s
    instructions to the jury concerning the assessment of this evidence.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>I.            Additional Facts </h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;
'><span
lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <span
lang=EN-US>Identification of the Shooter</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the shooting, the after-hours nightclub was
    crowded, exceeding its capacity by thirty or more people.  The front door of the nightclub was
    locked.  At about 3:40 a.m., four black
    males requested Peter Keene, the operator of the nightclub, to unlock the front
    door so that they could leave.  When
    Keene went to do so, however, the men made no move to leave.  Instead, they remained inside the front
    entrance of the nightclub with their backs to Keene, who was standing about
    three feet away from them.  Other
    patrons were also nearby.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some time passed, during which Keene noticed Ellison standing
    near the four men, in front of a railing.  Keene then saw one of the four men remove a gun from the waist of his
    pants.  Keene recognized the man with
    the gun as someone he had seen in the nightclub and around the neighbourhood on
    previous occasions, although he did not know his name.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The shooter fired several shots in rapid succession.  Keene saw Ellison fall to the ground.  When the shooting stopped, Keene opened the
    front door and stepped around it to stand outside the nightclub.  From this vantage point, he continued to
    observe the shooter and his companions as they fled.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ellison was shot three times, once in the mouth and twice in
    the back.  He died from his wounds
    before the police and an ambulance arrived.  Keene called 911 almost immediately after the shooting.  During this call, he repeatedly said that he
    knew the shooter and could identify him.  He also said that the shooter was a black male, aged twenty to
    twenty-five. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At about 4:25 a.m., Keene met with Detective Zubek and told
    him that he could identify the shooter.  Later that morning, Keene gave a videotaped statement to the police in
    which he provided a detailed description of Ellison’s assailant.  Among other matters, Keene said that the
    shooter had a “little bump” or a “little round thing” on the back of his
    head.  When asked by the police
    interviewer whether this was a bone, Keene replied: “Yeah. Somethin’ like
    that.”  At one point, in respect of the
    shooter’s forehead, Keene said that the shooter had a “little sink cut” and
    that there was a “little part” where the shooter’s head divided. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 24, 2001, Keene again confirmed to the police that he
    could identify the shooter.  He was then
    shown a police photo line-up and immediately identified the appellant’s
    photograph as that of the shooter.  In
    so doing, Keene stated that he had known the person he identified for a “couple
    years” and said, “Well I see him all the time.  I see him all about” and “I see him around very much you know.”  During the course of the trial, Keene also
    provided an in-dock identification of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although various patrons were near the front entrance of the
    nightclub at the time of the shooting, only two provided descriptions of the
    shooter to the police.  Neither of these
    descriptions was as detailed as that furnished by Keene.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal;
'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Trial</h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(i) The Crown’s Position</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was the Crown’s position at trial that the strength of the
    identification evidence alone justified a conviction.  The Crown also sought, however, to lead evidence of motive and
    planning and deliberation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No direct evidence implicated Ellison in the stabbing
    incident.  However, Ling Gao, the wife
    of the owner of the sports bar, testified that while she was working at the
    sports bar on July 21, 2000, she evicted a group of teenagers who were playing
    pool.  One of the teenagers was called
    “George”.  After Ellison was killed, Ms.
    Gao recognized him from his photograph in a newspaper as one of the group that
    had been playing pool on July 21.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown also sought to rely on evidence of out-of-court
    statements allegedly made by Ellison to his mother, Gwendolyn Freckleton,
    regarding the July 2000 stabbing and the February 2001 shooting incidents.  For the purpose of a pre-trial <i>voir dire</i>,
    a videotaped statement to the police provided by Ms. Freckleton on May 3, 2001
    and her evidence on a <i>voir dire</i> at the appellant’s preliminary inquiry
    were tendered by the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Ms. Freckleton, she learned from a third party in
    the summer of 2000 that her son had been involved in a stabbing incident.  When she confronted her son with this
    information, he essentially denied any involvement, claiming that it was a
    rumour and telling his mother to “cool it”.  Ms. Freckleton believed that her son was hiding the truth from her.  Later, after he was shot at the House of
    Lancaster, Ellison told his mother that he had been shot by “a white guy and
    two brothers” who had guns and knives.  Ellison allegedly said that his three assailants included two black
    brothers from Trinidad, one of whom he had stabbed the previous summer in
    connection with a dispute regarding a pool debt, and that the shooter was the
    brother of the stabbing victim (collectively, the “Statements”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Freckleton also said that, at some point after the February
    2001 shooting, the police came to her home and spoke privately with
    Ellison.  After the police left, Ms.
    Freckleton advised her son to tell the police what he knew.  Ellison, who did not disclose the identity
    of the person who shot him to the police, told his mother that he was not going
    to “inform on the guy” because, when Ellison stabbed him, the “guy” did not
    inform on Ellison.  Ms. Freckleton said
    that the stabbing referenced by her son was the one at “Ms. Chink’s bar”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown relied on Ms. Freckleton’s testimony as evidence of
    motive that supported both the Crown’s identification case and its theory that
    the murder was both planned and deliberate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge admitted the evidence of the Statements under
    the principled exception to the hearsay rule.  He held that this evidence was necessary and that the Statements were
    not made under “inherently unreliable” circumstances.  He concluded that although Ms. Freckleton’s evidence presented
    “problems”, it was not “so implausible or inherently unworthy of belief that it
    would produce unfair prejudice that would outweigh the probative value of her
    evidence”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No forensic evidence linked the appellant to the crime
    scene.  The evidence at trial, however,
    established that the gun used to kill Ellison was the same gun used in the
    House of Lancaster shooting two months earlier.  The same gun, with a modified barrel, was employed in two other
    shooting incidents that occurred after the appellant’s arrest in May 2001.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i>(ii)            The
    Defence Position</i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s defence at trial, through counsel, was to
    attack the reliability of Keene’s identification evidence.  In addition, with respect to the evidence of
    the State-ments, the defence challenged both the reliability of Ellison as an
    informant and the reliability and accuracy of Ms. Freckleton’s testimony.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was common ground that the appellant was stabbed in July
    2000, and that Ellison was shot outside the House of Lancaster and never
    identified the perpetrators to the police.  However, the defence maintained that the Crown had failed to prove a
    link between Ellison and the appellant in respect of either incident.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (1)            The
    Failure to Provide a ‘<i>Chartier</i> Instruction’</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Chartier, supra</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada held that a witness’s identifi-cation of
    a murder suspect was not established where there was evidence of one dissimilar
    feature between the witness’s description of the killer and the appearance of
    the suspect.  In these circumstances,
    the witness in question, at most, had merely noted a resemblance between the
    killer and the suspect.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant relies on <i>Chartier</i> to argue that, because
    Keene’s description of the shooter was “materially” dissimilar to the
    appellant’s appearance, the jury should have been instructed that Keene’s
    testimony could be exculpatory evidence exonerating the appellant, not just
    inculpatory evidence of identification.  I disagree, for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, in my view, <i>Chartier</i> had no application in this case.  <i>Chartier</i> did not involve jury instructions, nor was
    it a criminal case.  Although the
    principles identified in <i>Chartier</i> have been applied in the criminal law
    domain, they are not engaged in all eye-witness identification cases.  As observed by this court in <i>R. v. Dimitrov</i> (2003), 181 C.C.C. (3d) 554 at para. 18, leave to appeal to S.C.C.
    refused, [2004] S.C.C.A. No. 59: “The rule in <i>Chartier</i> applies to cases in which there is a <i>clear
    dissimilarity</i> in the witness’s identification <i>coupled with a lack of
    supporting evidence</i>.” [Emphasis added.]  See also <i>R. v. Boucher</i> (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 52 (Ont. C.A.) at
    para. 19; <i>R. v. Bennett</i> (2003), 179 C.C.C. (3d) 244 (Ont. C.A.) at para.
    96, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2003] S.C.C.A. No. 534.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case, unlike <i>Chartier</i>, involves evidence of a
    witness’s direct recognition of the appellant as the shooter, rather than
    evidence of mere resemblance between the shooter and the appellant.  From the outset of his dealings with the
    police, Keene repeatedly stated that he knew the shooter personally and that he
    could identify him.  Although the record
    suggests that Keene had some obvious communication limitations as a witness, he
    never wavered in his assertion that he knew the appellant from before the night
    of the murder and that he recognized him as the shooter.  In addition, Keene unhesitatingly identified
    the appellant in a police photo line-up.  No challenge to the propriety or fairness of the line-up is made on this
    appeal.  This evidence was available to
    the jury to enhance the reliability of Keene’s identification of the appellant
    as the shooter: see <i>R. v. Quercia</i> (1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 380 (Ont. C.A.)
    at 387.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, to trigger a ‘<i>Chartier</i> instruction’, a clear
    dissimilarity between the eyewitness’s identification and the accused’s
    appearance must exist, together with a lack of other evidential support for the
    identification evidence.  In my opinion,
    neither of these prerequisites was satisfied in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Among the alleged “material” dissimilarities between Keene’s
    description of the shooter and the appellant’s physical appearance, two are
    especially significant:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) Keene told the police within hours of the
    shooting that the shooter had a “little bump” or a “little round thing” that
    was “very noticeable” in the back of his head.  The appellant, however, claims that there is nothing distinctive about
    the back of his head; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) Keene indicated that the shooter had an
    unusual fore-head, whereas the appellant claims that the evidence confirmed
    that he has a normal forehead.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>The record, however, undercuts these
    claims by the appellant.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, Detective Sergeant Martin, the police booking
    officer, testified that she noticed a distinctive feature at the back of the
    appellant’s head, both at the time of his arrest and, again, during some of her
    observations of the appellant in court.  She described this as a small circular spot on the back of his head, in
    the “shape of a Loonie”, stated that it was “very apparent”, and indicated that
    the appellant’s hair was “growing different there than on the rest of his
    head”.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Hermann Helmuth, an anthropologist who testified for the
    defence concerning his observations of the appellant in court, said that he did
    not notice any bumps or protrusions on the back of the appellant’s head.  However, he did describe in his evidence a
    particular form of hair feature known as an “occipital hair whorl”, which
    occurs when the direction of growth in a person’s hair turns either clockwise
    or counter-clockwise.  According to Dr.
    Helmuth, the appellant’s braided hairstyle at trial made it impossible to tell
    whether he had a distinctive hair “whorl”, as described by Martin.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Martin’s testimony on this issue was consistent with Keene’s
    description of the shooter and, hence, supportive of his identification of the
    appellant as the assailant at the nightclub.  Helmuth’s evidence, although not confirmatory of a distinctive feature
    on the back of the appellant’s head, did establish the existence of a hair “whorl”
    phenomenon of the type described by Martin.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The record reveals a similar flaw in the appellant’s
    contention that there is nothing unusual about the appearance of his
    forehead.  In his videotaped April 2001
    statement, Keene described the shooter as having “a little sink cut”, stating
    that his forehead had a “little part”, “like the head divide”.  In his earlier statement on the same day to
    Detective Zubek, Keene described the shooter’s forehead with gestures, from
    which Zubek understood that the shooter had a big, prominent forehead.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Helmuth testified that the appellant’s “frontal eminences”
    – the rounded elevations of the frontal bone above each eye socket – were
    circular, “moderately developed bumps”, that were both “slightly forward
    protruding” and visible in the court-room.  In her testimony, Detective Sergeant Martin outlined her observations in
    court of the appellant’s “protruding forehead”.  She said that she observed two “very noticeable bumps on either
    side of his forehead” and that he had a horizontal line in his forehead that
    “pretty much divided his forehead immediately in half”.  The evidence of these witnesses thus lent
    support both to Keene’s identification evidence, and to the Crown’s claim that
    the visibility of the appellant’s distinctive forehead feature depended upon
    the nature of the appellant’s hairstyle and the prevailing lighting conditions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor am I persuaded that the evidence established other clear
    dissimilarities between the appellant’s characteristics and those of the
    shooter.  For example, the appellant
    stresses that he is right-handed, whereas the evidence indicated that the
    shooter used his left hand to fire the gun that killed Ellison.  But there was no evidence at trial that the
    manner in which the gun was fired, or its features (such as its weight or
    firing mechanism), required the shooter to use his dominant hand in order to
    discharge the weapon successfully.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in this case, the trial judge provided the jury with a
    clear caution about the frailties of identification evidence in general, and
    Keene’s evidence in particular.  He also
    reviewed for the jury much of the evidence relied upon by the defence as
    pointing to dissimilarities between the appellant’s appearance and that of the
    shooter at the night-club.  Although the
    trial judge did not touch in his jury charge upon all the suggested
    dissimilarities between Keene’s description of the shooter and the appellant’s
    appearance, these were reviewed by counsel in their closing addresses to the
    jury.  In any event, as Doherty J.A. of
    this court recently observed in <i>R. v. Savoury and Shaw</i> (2005), 200
    C.C.C. (3d) 94 at para. 13:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Chartier</i> is not
    authority for the proposition that in a jury trial it is the trial judge’s
    function to decide whether there are discrepancies between a description
    provided by a witness and the actual appearance of an accused and, if so,
    whether those discrepancies are significant. These are factual questions that
    arise out of the evidence and like other factual questions, are for the jury to
    decide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, it is also
    significant that an instruction of the type now contended for by the appellant
    was not sought by defence counsel at trial.  Nor did defence counsel object to the trial judge’s limiting
    instructions concerning eyewitness identification evidence and Keene’s
    testimony.  While not determinative,
    this tells strongly against the submission that a ‘<i>Chartier</i> instruction’ was
    required. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)            The Evidence of the Statements</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant attacks the admission of Ms. Freckleton’s
    evidence of the State-ments on the grounds that the trial judge erred by
    concluding that the Crown had established the threshold reliability of this
    evidence and, further, by concluding that the probative value of this evidence
    outweighed its prejudicial effect.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>(i)            Threshold Reliability</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of his claim that the threshold reliability of the
    challenged evidence was not made out, the appellant makes two principal
    submissions.  First, he contends that by
    focusing on whether the circumstances surrounding the making of the Statements
    were “inherently unreliable”, the trial judge applied the wrong legal test, and
    thereby effec-tively imposed an onus on the appellant to establish that Ellison
    had a motive to lie to his mother, instead of requiring the Crown to
    demonstrate that Ellison did not have a motive to lie.  The appellant maintains that this was the
    same type of reversible error identified by this court in <i>R. v. Czibulka</i> (2004), 189 C.C.C. (3d) 199, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2004] S.C.C.A.
    No. 502.  Second, the appellant submits
    that the trial judge erred by failing to treat Ms. Freckleton’s credibility and
    reliability as relevant to his threshold reliability analysis.  I would reject both of these submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hearsay evidence in the form of an out-of-court statement is
    presumptively inadmissible.  As observed
    by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Khelawon</i>, 2006 SCC 57, released
    on December 14, 2006, the central concern underlying this exclusionary rule is
    the difficulty of testing the reliability of the declarant’s assertion.  The exclusionary rule recognizes the
    difficulty for a trier of fact to assess what weight, if any, is to be given to
    a statement made by a person who has not been seen or heard, and who has not
    been subject to the test of cross-examination.  As Charron J., writing for the Supreme Court, explained at para. 35 of <i>Khelawon</i>:
    “The fear is that untested hearsay evidence may be afforded more weight than it
    deserves.”  See also paras. 58, 59 and
    61 of <i>Khelawon</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is now settled law, however, that hearsay evidence in the
    nature of an out-of-court statement is admissible on a principled basis as an
    exception to this exclusionary hearsay rule where its admission can be
    justified on the twin criteria of necessity and reliability: <i>R. v. Khan</i> (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 92 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Smith</i> (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d)
    257 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Starr</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.); <i>Khelawon</i>.  “Necessity” was not in issue in this case
    because Ellison was dead.  The issue
    here was whether the criterion of “reliability” was satisfied, having regard to
    the circumstances under which the Statements were made.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Supreme Court of Canada has emphasized repeatedly,
    there is an important distinction between threshold and ultimate
    reliability.  Only the former is relevant
    to admissibility.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Historically, the Supreme Court also stressed the distinction
    between factors relevant to threshold reliability and those that concern
    ultimate reliability alone.  Thus, in <i>Starr</i> at paras. 215-17, the Supreme Court indicated that, at the threshold
    reliability stage, the judicial inquiry is concerned only with the
    circumstances surrounding the making of the statement at issue and whether
    these afford “sufficient elements of reliability” that the statement should be
    considered by the trier of fact.  See
    also <i>R. v. Humaid</i> (2006), 208 C.C.C. (3d) 43 (Ont. C.A.), leave to
    appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2006] S.C.C.A. No. 232; <i>R. v. Hawkins</i> (1996),
    111 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Khelawon</i>, however, this principle was
    abrogated.  At para. 93, Charron J. held
    that the factors to be considered on the admissibility inquiry “should not be
    categorized in terms of threshold and ultimate reliability”.  Instead, “the court should adopt a more
    functional approach…and focus on the particular dangers raised by the hearsay
    evidence sought to be introduced and on those attributes or circumstances
    relied upon by the proponent to overcome those dangers”.  Under this approach, the trial judge plays a
    limited, albeit critical, role in determining admissibility.  Justice Charron cautioned at para. 93, “[I]t
    is crucial to the integrity of the fact-finding process that the question of
    ultimate reliability not be pre-determined on the admissibility <i>voir dire</i>.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, <i>Khelawon</i> confirms that while the factors relevant
    to the admissibility of a hearsay statement should not be characterized
    according to the divide between ultimate and threshold reliability, the
    distinction between these measures of reliability remains of vital importance
    on the admissibility inquiry.  Only
    threshold reliability is to be inquired into on the admissibility <i>voir dire</i>.  In addition, the relevance of
    any particular factor to the admissibility inquiry depends on the particular
    dangers “arising from the hearsay nature of the statement and the available
    means, if any, of overcoming them”: see <i>Khelawon</i>, at paras. 50 and
    55.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legal test for the assessment of threshold reliability
    mandated by <i>Starr </i>and related cases places an onus on the party seeking
    the admission of a hearsay statement to show that the circumstances surrounding
    the making of the statement are sufficiently supportive of its reliability to
    permit its admission, despite the absence of an opportunity to cross-examine
    the declarant: see <i>Smith, supra</i>, at p. 270; <i>Humaid</i> at para. 50; <i>R.
    v. Kimberley</i> (2001), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 64.  Under this test, there is no evidential onus
    on the party resisting the admission of a hearsay statement to establish that
    the statement was made in unreliable circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not read the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Khelawon</i> as displacing these principles.  <i>Khelawon</i> affirms that there are two principal ways of satisfying the reliability
    requirement, neither of which excludes consideration of the other.  One is to show that the traditional dangers
    associated with hearsay are either not present or are overcome because the
    truth and accuracy of the hearsay statement in issue can be sufficiently tested
    by means other than contemporaneous cross-examination: see for example, <i>R.
    v. B. (K.G.)</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (S.C.C.); <i>Hawkins, supra</i>.  Another is to show that the circumstances in
    which the statement was made provide sufficient comfort in its truth and
    accuracy: see the <i>Khan, Smith, Starr</i> and <i>Humaid</i> line of
    cases.  In either situation, the
    proponent of the hearsay evidence bears the onus of satisfying the reliability
    requirement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge referred in his admissibility
    ruling to whether the circumstances surrounding the Statements were “inherently
    unreliable”.  To the extent that these
    references by the trial judge may be read as limiting the Crown’s evidential
    onus to proof that the Statements were not made in circumstances of <i>unreliability</i>,
    or as requiring the appellant to demonstrate that the Statements were made in unreliable
    circumstances, the trial judge misspoke.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On consideration of the trial judge’s ruling as a whole,
    however, I conclude that his reliability analysis was properly concerned with
    those circumstances that either supported or negated the truth and accuracy
    and, hence, the reliability of the Statements.  In my view, although the trial judge used the wrong language to
    reference the correct legal principles, he ultimately applied the proper legal
    test to the facts of this case as he found them.  I say this for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In determining that the evidence of the Statements should be
    admitted, the trial judge reasoned as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   There is nothing inherently unreliable
    about an account by a shot and wounded family member, recounting to another
    family member after the incident, the basic circumstances of the shooting and
    what led up to it, particularly where the family member already has independent
    information about the shooting, to some extent, from the authorities and from
    third parties.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   Although a family member might have reason
    to minimize an incident in order to calm down or reassure a family member,
    nothing in the declarant’s alleged statement would do so.  It would do the opposite.  He gains nothing by telling her this story
    falsely, and on the other hand he stands to lose by telling her this story
    falsely.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   The mother already knew from others that he
    had been shot, and already knew from others that he had earlier stabbed someone
    in July.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   Although it is argued that he lied in order
    to calm her down and put a spin on events that would cause her not to be angry
    with him, or to throw her off the trail, it is difficult to see how he could
    achieve that by telling his mother what he did.  One might think the opposite.  One might think that he knew he would upset her by telling her what he
    did and that it, therefore, would be against his interest for him to tell her
    what he did, if what he told her would be more likely true because it was a
    statement against his own self-interest.  Telling this story falsely to his mother would not help calm her down
    and put him in a good light, it would do the opposite.  If he wanted to mislead her the easiest
    thing would be to say it was a stranger who shot him, thereby minimizing his
    own blameworthiness from the stabbing.  By linking his shooting to his own stabbing of the person who the Crown
    seeks to prove is the accused, it is asking for more concern on the part of his
    mother and not less concern on the part of his mother, hardly a factor that
    suggests unreliability and perhaps a factor that suggests the opposite to some
    degree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the <i>Khan, Starr</i> and <i>Smith</i> line of cases,
    various factors may be considered in evaluating whether a hearsay statement by
    a deceased declarant was made in circum-stances that substantially negate the
    possibility of inaccuracy or fabrication.  These include the presence or absence of any motive by the declarant to
    lie, the relationship between the declarant and the narrator of the statement,
    the possibility that the declarant was mistaken, and the state of mind of the
    declarant at the time that the statement was made.  As well, the contents of a declarant’s statement may be used for
    some purposes in determining the admissibility of the statement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These factors remain relevant under the <i>Khelawon</i> framework.  In addition, notwithstanding
    any previous statements by the Supreme Court of Canada to the contrary, <i>Khelawon</i> indicates that where reliability is said to be dependent on the inherent
    trustworthiness of the statement in issue, the trial judge must inquire into
    those factors tending to show whether the statement is true or not.  However, where the reliability requirement
    is said to be met on the ground that the trier of fact has a sufficient basis
    on which to assess the statement’s truth and accuracy, there is no need for the
    trial judge to inquire further into the likely truth of the statement.  That question is left to the ultimate trier
    of fact: see <i>Khelawon</i> at para. 92.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In some cases, evidence of the presence or absence of a motive
    by the declarant to fabricate plays a critical role in the determination of
    threshold reliability.  In <i>Starr</i>,
    Iacobucci J. indicated at para. 215 that indicators of the trustworthiness of a
    hearsay statement could be furnished where the declarant had “no motive to
    lie”.  At para. 216 he elaborated,
    “[L]ower courts have recognized that the absence of a motive to lie is a
    relevant factor in admitting evidence under the principled approach. …
    Conversely, the presence of a motive to lie may be grounds for exclusion of
    evidence under the principled approach.”  See also the decision of this court in <i>Khelawon</i> (2005), 194
    C.C.C. (3d) 161 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 24 <i>per</i> Blair J.A. (dissenting in
    the result); <i>Czibulka </i>at para. 36.  Although the Supreme Court, in <i>Khelawon</i>, overruled other aspects
    of <i>Starr</i>, the quoted passages from <i>Starr</i> remain unaffected.  Thus, evidence regarding motive to fabricate
    remains an important consideration in testing the truth and accuracy of a
    hearsay statement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Czibulka</i>, this court considered the importance to
    threshold reliability of this factor.  Writing for the court, Rosenberg J.A. held that the hearsay statement in
    question should have been excluded because there was little or no evidence of
    the circumstances under which the statement was made.  In particular, the trial judge erred in that case by relying upon
    the absence of evidence of the circumstances under which the statement was made
    to find that there was no evidence of a motive by the declarant to fabricate: <i>Czibulka</i> at para. 27.  This court held that there
    was no evidence to support this key finding.  Instead, in effect, the trial judge improperly approached the question
    of fabrication “by using the absence of evidence of fabrication to find that
    there was no evidence of a motive to fabricate”:  <i>Czibulka</i> at paras. 35 and 47.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge’s admissibility
    ruling in this case suffers from similar defects.  For three reasons, I disagree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, and importantly, Rosenberg J.A. stressed in <i>Czibulka</i> that there was virtually no evidence in that case of the circumstances under
    which the hearsay statement in issue was made.  That is not this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, there was evidence tendered on the <i>voir dire</i> about certain of the circum-stances surrounding the making of the
    Statements.  This included evidence of
    the events leading up to the Statements, the contents of the Statements, the
    timing of the Statements, the declarant’s alleged past history of
    untruthfulness to the narrator of the Statements, the declarant’s dealings with
    the police on the matters in issue, and some evidence of the relationship
    between the declarant and the person to whom the Statements were made.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, unlike <i>Czibulka</i>, this is not a case where there was no evidence and no logical inference
    that the deceased declarant had no motive to lie at the time that he made the
    statements in question to the person to whom he made them.  To the contrary, there was circumstantial
    evidence that supported the inference that Ellison had no motive to fabricate
    the Statements to this particular witness – his mother – on this particular
    occasion.  Upon evaluation of that
    evidence, the trial judge implicitly concluded that the possibility that
    Ellison had been untruthful was substantially negated by the circum-stances
    surrounding the making of the Statements.  Under <i>Khelawon</i>, this was a proper consideration: see
    paras. 52 and 92.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Rosenberg J.A. observed at paras. 37-40 and 50 of <i>Czibulka</i>, “whether there is a motive to fabricate
    the story related in [a] hearsay statement can turn on a number of
    considerations”, including the nature of the relationship between the declarant
    and the person to whom the statement was made, the context in which the
    statement was made, the circumstances under which the statement was made, and
    the subject matter of the statement.  All these factors were at play here and were considered by the trial
    judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    emphasized that the Statements involved a recounting by a son, who had been
    shot, to his mother of the background to his shooting.  This took place when the mother, Ms.
    Freckleton, already knew that her son had been shot and, notwith-standing his
    earlier denial to her, that he may have stabbed someone the previous summer.  The trial judge found that while
    Ellison may have made the Statements with a view to calming or reassuring his
    mother, the Statements, in fact, did not do so.  Further, by acknowledging to his mother that he had stabbed
    someone, Ellison failed to minimize his own involvement in the events leading
    up to his shooting and, instead, clearly acknowledged his own earlier criminal
    activity.  He also linked his own
    shooting to the stabbing by disclosing to his mother, for the first time, that
    he had stabbed the shooter’s brother.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, in undertaking his
    admissibility inquiry, the trial judge considered both the relationship between
    the declarant and the person to whom the Statements were made, as well as the
    context of the alleged Statements.  He
    was correct to do so.  These factors were
    relevant both to the issue of whether Ellison had a motive to fabricate the
    story related in the Statements and to the question whether the circumstances
    surrounding the making of the Statements themselves tended to provide
    sufficient comfort in the truth and accuracy of the Statements.  While
    the evidence on the <i>voir dire</i> of the circumstances under which the
    Statements were made was not extensive, it cannot be said that there was an
    evidential gap on this issue of the type present in <i>Czibulka</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in contrast
    to the facts in <i>Czibulka</i>, there were other <i>indicia</i> here of the reliability of the Statements.  In this case, the trial judge found that the Statements
    themselves would have only heightened, rather than reduced, Ms. Freckleton’s
    concerns regarding her son’s conduct and safety.  This factual finding, which was open to the trial judge on the
    evidence adduced on the <i>voir dire</i>, attracts deference from this court: see <i>R. v. Merz</i> (1991), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 259 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 49.  In my view, this finding also accords with
    logic and common sense.  Perhaps for
    obvious reasons, there was no suggestion at trial that Ellison would lie to his
    mother on the occasion of the Statements to enhance her concerns.  Accordingly, this finding by the trial judge
    militated strongly against the possibility that Ellison fabricated his story to
    his mother, thereby alleviating concerns about Ellison’s sincerity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Statements also
    cast Ellison in a bad light and implicated him in criminal activity.  Apart from suggesting, as they did, that
    Ellison may have become a ‘marked man’ as a result of his own conduct, the
    contents of the Statements were clearly declarations against Ellison’s own
    interest.  This, too, enhanced the
    circumstantial assurance of the truth and accuracy of the Statements.  As observed in <i>Czibulka</i> at para. 31,
    “people are unlikely to make false statements against their interest”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was
    also aware that the timing of the Statements was relevant to threshold
    reliability, including to the issue of Ellison’s possible motive to lie.  Although the evidence did not establish the
    precise date of the Statements, the trial judge found as a fact that they were
    made, at the latest, within thirty-eight days after the House of Lancaster
    shooting.  There is no suggestion that
    this holding was flawed.  The trial
    judge held that this timing was sufficiently proximate to that shooting
    incident to provide some support for the reliability of the Statements.  Thus, on the findings of the trial judge,
    the timing of the Statements removed any real concern about inaccurate
    memory.  The Statements were clearly
    prompted by Ellison being shot.  Consequently, the circum-stances surrounding the making of the Statements
    (including Ellison’s state of mind) were entirely different than the prevailing
    circumstances when Ms. Freckleton first confronted her son about the stabbing,
    when he disclaimed any involvement in the incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, the
    trial judge also recognized the dangers of admitting the evidence of the
    Statements when Ellison was not available for cross-examination.  He assessed this danger in the context of
    the evidence of Ellison’s alleged history of dishonesty in his dealings with
    his mother, stating: “The question of [Ellison’s] pattern of veracity to his
    mother and possible motivations to lie to his mother, is accessible through
    cross-examination of his mother, at least indirectly.  And cross-examination of her on this point goes some distance to
    substituting for cross-examination of the deceased declarant.”  I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, and finally,
    it is important to underscore that evidence of a motive to lie will not
    automatically result in the exclusion of a hearsay statement.  This was recognized by Iacobucci J. at para.
    216 of <i>Starr</i> when he said, as I have indicated, that
    “the presence of a motive to lie <i>may</i> be grounds for exclusion of evidence under
    the principled approach”. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I adopt the following
    propositions advanced by Blair J.A. in this court’s decision in <i>Khelawon, supra,</i> at para. 68 (dissenting in the result) with which, I understand, the
    majority of this court and the Supreme Court of Canada expressed no
    disagreement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Starr</i> stands for
    the proposition that “the presence of motive to lie may be grounds for the
    exclusion of evidence under the principled approach”. … It does not say that
    evidence must be excluded in the presence of <i>indicia</i> of any motive to
    lie, regardless of the strength of those <i>indicia</i>. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   A motive to fabricate may be slight, or it
    may be strong, or it may lie somewhere between those extremes.  In my view, depending on its strength, the
    presence of a motive to fabricate may be overridden, for threshold reliability
    purposes, by other factors pointing to reliability.  It is for the trial judge to determine, in all of the
    circumstances, whether, in spite of the presence of some evidence of such a
    motive, other pertinent factors nonetheless render the proffered statement
    sufficiently reliable at the threshold stage that it should be passed on to the
    trier of fact for determination of its ultimate reliability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore reject the appellant’s claim that the trial
    judge’s threshold reliability analysis was infected by a ‘<i>Czibulka</i> error’.  There was circumstantial
    evidence in this case that supported the inference that Ellison had no known
    motive to fabricate these Statements to his mother at the particular time when
    they were said to have been made.  In
    the language of the Supreme Court in <i>Khelawon</i> at para. 66, the
    circumstances in which the Statements came about “provided sufficient comfort
    in [their] truth and accuracy” to warrant the admission of this evidence for
    consideration by the trier of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also do not accept the appellant’s contention that the trial
    judge erred in his treatment of the question of Ms. Freckleton’s credibility
    and reliability.  The trial judge’s
    ruling reveals that he recognized the weaknesses in Ms. Freckleton’s
    evidence.  He held, however, that the
    requisite reliability analysis was concerned with Ellison’s reliability and the
    reliability of the Statements, rather than with the credibility and reliability
    of Ms. Freckleton.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This holding is unimpeachable.  The quality of Ms. Freckleton’s evidence was irrelevant to
    threshold reliability: see <i>Humaid </i>at paras. 50-51.  Threshold reliability stands as a substitute
    for cross-examination of the declarant, rather than of the narrator of the
    statement in issue.  Here, Ms.
    Freckleton was available to testify and her credibility and reliability were
    subject to full cross-examination at trial.</p>

page-break-after:avoid'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that the trial judge erred by
    overstating the probative value and underestimating the prejudicial effect of
    the evidence of the Statements.  He
    submits that, on a proper assessment, this evidence should have been excluded
    by the trial judge in the exercise of his residual discretion, even if the
    evidence was otherwise admissible.  Finally, the appellant maintains that this evidence was inadmissible
    when assessed in the light of all the trial evidence.  In my view, these arguments cannot succeed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge undertook the necessary balancing of the
    probative value and prejudicial effect of the evidence of the Statements.  Nothing in his ruling suggests that he was
    unmindful of his authority to exclude this evidence, if warranted, even if he
    was satisfied as to threshold reliability.  The trial judge considered the defence concerns that the absence of any
    direct evidence linking Ellison to the stabbing of the appellant rendered the
    evidence of the Statements irrelevant and prejudicial, and that the jury would
    be distracted from its task if the evidence was admitted due to natural
    sympathy for Ms. Freckleton’s loss of her son.  He then concluded, as he was entitled to do, that the potential
    probative value of this evidence outweighed its possible prejudicial effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge neither
    overstated the potential pro-bative value of this evidence, nor misapprehended
    or understated its possible prejudicial impact.  The trial judge stated, “It cannot be said that the evidence is
    of trifling value, in an allegation of a revenge shooting such as this.”  If anything, this observation minimized the
    probative worth of this evidence.  If
    accepted by the jury, the evidence of the Statements, together with Ms. Gao’s
    testimony, would afford compelling evidence of a link between Ellison and the
    stabbing of the appellant and, hence, of a motive for revenge by the
    appellant.  Moreover, the fact of
    Ellison’s declaration that both the appellant and his brother were involved in
    the House of Lancaster shooting, if accepted by the jury, was strongly
    probative of the Crown’s case on planning and deliberation.  In these circumstances, there is no basis
    for appellate intervention with the trial judge’s discretionary decision to
    admit the evidence of the Statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would also reject the appellant’s argument that the evidence
    of the Statements was inadmissible in the light of all the evidence tendered at
    trial.  I agree with the view of the
    Nova Scotia Court of Appeal expressed in <i>R. v. Johnson</i> (2004), 188
    C.C.C. (3d) 214 at para. 35, that appellate scrutiny of a trial judge’s
    decision to admit evidence at trial following a pre-trial <i>voir dire</i> must
    be confined to consideration of the evidence on the <i>voir dire</i> and the
    trial judge’s assessment of that evidence.  Pre-trial decisions regarding the admission of evidence cannot be
    reviewed retrospectively through the application of hindsight, based on a
    subsequently changed evidential landscape.</p>
  <h4 style='

  <h4 style='

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also do not accept the appellant’s assertion that the trial
    judge’s instructions to the jury on the assessment of the evidence of the
    Statements were deficient.  To the
    contrary, I agree with the Crown’s submission before this court that,
    considered as a whole and in the light of the issues engaged during the trial,
    the charge fairly and adequately conveyed to the jury the principles governing
    its assessment of this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Near the beginning of his charge, the trial judge provided the
    jury with a general instruction regarding the proper approach to the assessment
    of the testimony of witnesses, including the reliability and truthfulness of a
    witness’s evidence.  Later in his
    charge, when explicitly addressing Ms. Freckleton’s evidence, the trial judge
    stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   First, you have to decide what, if
    anything, he said to his mother.  In
    deciding whether or not George actually said these things that she reports, use
    your common sense.  Take into account
    his state of mind and his mother’s at the time of any conversation and the
    circumstances in which the conversation took place, and anything else that may
    make George’s story more believable or less believable.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   If you find that George’s mother has
    reliably reported any or all of what George said, you may use what you think is
    reliable to help decide the case.  But,
    if you think that there is anything that she said about what he told her, if
    there is anything that she has not reliably reported, don’t rely on that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   You should be cautious when you determine
    how much or how little you depend on the evidence of what you find that George
    said to his mother.  It may be more or
    less reliable than other evidence that was given.  George was not under oath or affirmation when he spoke to his
    mother.  He didn’t promise to tell the
    truth.  You didn’t see or hear him
    testify.  He could not be cross-examined
    here like his mother or the other witnesses.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>   Don’t consider this evidence by
    itself.  It is only part of the evidence
    which is taken into account with all the other evidence that may make it more
    or less reliable.  It is up to you to
    decide how much or little of that evidence you rely upon.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> Here are three questions to keep in mind:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.    Would George’s mother have any reason to
    make up the story about what George said?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.    Would George have any reason to make up
    the story or any part of the story he told his mother?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.    Do you think George’s mother may be
    mistaken about what George said, or might have put her own interpretation on
    what George said, or might have mixed it up with something that somebody told
    her later on?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the trial judge returned to the subject of Ms.
    Freckleton’s evidence and again cautioned the jury on the need to approach it
    with care.  He reviewed her evidence and
    summarized the defence and Crown positions concerning it.  In brief but pointed terms he reminded the
    jury of the core defence claims that Ellison was unreliable and untruthful, and
    that Ms. Freckleton, although an honest witness, may have been confused in her
    testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, on numerous occasions during his charge, the trial
    judge cautioned the jury to consider all the evidence and not to consider any
    one piece of evidence in isolation.  He
    reiterated this caution in his instructions on Ms. Freckleton’s evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I make the following observations concerning these
    instructions.  First, they responded
    directly to the defence challenge to the reliability of the evidence of the
    State-ments including, in particular, to the defence themes that Ellison was an
    unreliable informant and that Ms. Freckleton’s recounting of the Statements was
    unreliable and inaccurate.  The trial
    judge’s instructions echoed these themes and explicitly drew the jury’s
    attention to the need to evaluate the reliability both of Ellison as an
    informant and of Ms. Freckleton’s testimony.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, contrary to the appellant’s submission, the trial
    judge’s instructions alerted the jury to the underlying weaknesses of Ms.
    Freckleton’s hearsay evidence by underscoring the fact that Ellison, if he made
    the utterances alleged, did so in circumstances where no assurance of
    truthfulness was offered.  They also
    pointed out that because Ellison was unavailable for cross-examination, the
    jury would not have the benefit of assessing his testimony or truthfulness as a
    witness in its deliberative process.  These warnings could not have failed to convey to the jury the dangers
    of placing reliance on the evidence of the Statements, and the need to approach
    this evidence with care.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the specific questions posed by the trial judge for the
    jury’s consideration, quoted above, highlighted the need to determine whether
    Ms. Freckleton was mistaken in her recall of her son’s statements, whether she
    was merely proffering her own version of his remarks, and whether her evidence
    was infused with, and consequently tainted by, third party information.  This caution was also directly responsive
    to, and supportive of, the defence attack on the reliability of the evidence of
    the Statements.  It unambiguously
    focused the jury’s attention on the issues it had to consider before it placed
    any reliance on this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, as the appellant concedes, the trial judge’s
    instructions conformed, almost exactly, to the Standard Jury Instructions for
    use in criminal jury trials in Ontario.  While the appellant complains that the trial judge erred by suggesting
    that the evidence of the Statements “may be more or less reliable than other
    evidence that was given”, in the context of the full instructions given, I do
    not regard this as significant.  The
    overall effect of the instructions emphasized that the inability to
    cross-examine Ellison lowered the reliability of the evidence of his alleged
    Statements, in contrast to the reliability of the evidence of “other witnesses”
    whose testimony could be tested in court under oath and cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, the instructions also complied with the guidelines
    outlined in <i>R. v. A. (S.)</i> (1992), 76 C.C.C. (3d) 522 (Ont. C.A.), by
    bringing home to the jury the need to determine whether the Statements were
    made and, if made, the nature of their contents, as well as the imperative to
    evaluate the evidence of the Statements carefully and in the light of all the
    other evidence at trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, if anything, the challenged instructions favoured the
    defence in several instances.  For
    example, in outlining Ms. Freckleton’s evidence for the jury, the trial judge
    quoted at length from her exchanges with counsel during cross-examination,
    including from questioning clearly designed to highlight the inconsistencies
    and other weaknesses in her evidence.  This could only have worked to the benefit of the defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied, therefore, that the trial judge’s instructions
    to the jury on this issue were more than adequate in the circumstances.  No objection was made at trial by the
    defence to the instructions provided.  In my opinion, based on the instructions provided, the jury would have
    understood that its task was first to decide whether the Statements were made
    and, if so, to then assess the reliability of the evidence of the Statements in
    the light of its inherent weaknesses, the positions of the parties, and all the
    other evidence at trial in determining what weight, if any, should be given to
    it.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague
    Cronk J.A. I respectfully disagree with my colleague’s conclusion that Ms.
    Freckleton’s evidence of the Statements was admissible. In my view, the trial
    judge erred in holding that the Crown had established the threshold reliability
    of this evidence and therefore it should not have been admitted. Accordingly, I
    would allow the appeal, set aside the appellant’s conviction and order a new
    trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>I.          The
    Trial Judge’s Reasons</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I read his reasons, the trial judge began the threshold
    reliability analysis by considering whether Ellison had a motive to fabricate
    the Statements. In doing so, he considered a theory of fabrication posited by
    the preliminary inquiry judge and in rejecting that theory implicitly concluded
    that Ellison had no motive to fabricate. Further, in the context of rejecting
    the theory of fabrication, the trial judge found the fact that Ellison
    acknowledged stabbing the shooter’s brother was against Ellison’s interest and
    therefore afforded some reliability to the statements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After making these findings, the trial judge went on to
    consider other factors that might contribute to or detract from the threshold
    reliability of the Statements. These factors included: the timing of the
    Statements and, in particular, their proximity to the shooting incident that is
    the subject matter of the Statements; Ellison’s specific veracity vis-à-vis his
    mother; the fact that Ellison’s pattern of veracity and possible motivations to
    lie was accessible, at least indirectly through cross-examination of his
    mother; and the inherent plausibility of Ellison telling more to his mother
    about the identity of the shooter than he told to the police. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After finding that the probative value of the evidence of the
    Statements was not outweighed by the possibility of unfair prejudice, the trial
    judge said he was “satisfied that the statements of [Ellison] to his mother
    should be admitted on the basis of the principled approach to the hearsay rule
    in terms of necessity and reliability.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>II.             Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, by proceeding as he did, the trial judge erred in
    three respects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, he erred in his approach to the motive to fabricate
    issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted above, on my reading of his reasons, the trial judge
    reached a conclusion that Ellison had no motive to fabricate the Statements by
    considering and rejecting a theory of fabrication posited by the preliminary
    inquiry judge, namely that Ellison told his mother that he was shot by the
    brother of a man he had stabbed in order to calm her down. In that respect, the
    preliminary inquiry judge indicated that Ellison had not previously
    acknowledged to his mother that he was involved in the stabbing and the
    information that she previously had was obtained from other sources. The
    preliminary inquiry judge theorized that Ellison’s main motivation in making
    the Statements would be to calm his mother down “and put whatever spin he could
    on events that would not cause her to be angry with him for his own
    shortcomings.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the trial proper, this theory of fabrication was identified
    by the Crown during the <i>voir dire</i> submissions and not by the defence. In rejecting it, the trial judge focussed
    on Ellison’s alleged motivation to calm his mother down. On my review of the
    record, I see no specific evidence giving rise to a theory that Ellison wanted
    to calm his mother down. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in my view, the trial judge erred in: a) considering
    the issue of motive to fabricate in isolation from the issue of Ellison’s
    specific veracity vis-à-vis his mother; b) holding that there was no motive to
    fabricate based on a record that demonstrated, at its highest, that there was
    no evidence of a motive to fabricate; and c) the significance he afforded to
    the Statements being against Ellison’s interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted in <i>R. v.
    Czibulka </i>(2004), 189 C.C.C. (3d) 199 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C.
    refused [2004] S.C.C.A. No. 502, at paras. 37 to 40, the question of whether
    there is a motive to fabricate the story related in a hearsay statement can
    turn on a number of considerations, including: the nature of the relationship
    between the declarant and the person to whom the statement was made; the nature
    of the relationship between the declarant and the person about whom the
    statement is made; the circumstances in which a statement is made; and the
    subject matter of the statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, there was evidence on the record concerning
    Ellison being deceitful with his mother about his activities and with whom he
    associated. In that regard, the trial judge made a specific finding in a
    subsequent portion of his reasons that Ellison’s mother had expressed concerns
    about Ellison’s veracity in relation to her on at least one earlier occasion.
    In my view, it was incumbent on the trial judge to consider the evidence
    concerning Ellison’s specific veracity vis-à-vis his mother in relation to the
    issue of motive to fabricate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Smith</i> (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d)
    257, the Supreme Court of Canada found that a hearsay declarant’s capacity for
    deceitfulness may be a relevant consideration in assessing the issue of motive
    to fabricate. The issue in <i>Smith</i> was
    the admissibility of three telephone calls made by the deceased to her mother.
    In relation to the first two statements (“Larry has left me”; and “Larry has
    not come back and I need a ride”), the Court held that the statements were made
    under circumstances that did not give rise to apprehensions about their reliability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the third statement (“Larry has come back and I no longer need a ride”),
    the Court said it was not “without apprehensions that [the declarant] may have
    been mistaken, <i>or, indeed, might have
    intended to deceive her mother on this account</i>.” [Emphasis added.] While
    there was evidence in <i>Smith </i>indicating
    a specific theory of fabrication (the mother may have arranged a ride with
    someone of whom the appellant was afraid), the Court also noted that the
    declarant was travelling under an assumed name using a credit card that she
    knew was either stolen or forged, and therefore was at least capable of deceit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to finding other possible motives to fabricate the Court said: “It may
    have been that she decided to lie to her mother to conceal some aspect of her
    activities or circumstances”. The Court went on to explain its reasoning as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I wish to emphasize
    that I do not advance these alternative hypotheses as accurate reconstructions
    of what occurred on the night of [the declarant’s] murder. I engage in such
    speculation only for the purpose of showing that the circumstances under which
    [the declarant] made the third telephone call to her mother were not such as to
    provide that circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness that would justify the
    admission of its contents by way of hearsay evidence without the possibility of
    cross-examination. <i>Indeed, at the
    highest, it can only be said that hearsay evidence of the third telephone call
    is equally consistent with the accuracy of [the declarant’s] statements, and
    also consistent with a number of other hypotheses. I cannot say that this
    evidence could not reasonably have been expected to have changed significantly
    had [the declarant] been available to give evidence in person and subjected to cross-examination</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the trial judge’s implicit conclusion that the Statements were made
    under circumstances that did not give rise to apprehensions about their
    reliability and his express conclusion that to the extent the Statements were
    against Ellison’s interest they provided some support for their reliability,
    were based on considering and rejecting the theory of fabrication that Ellison
    wanted to calm his mother down. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge reached these conclusions without considering the
    factors that did give rise to apprehensions about the reliability of the
    Statements, namely, the circumstances leading up to the Statements (Ellison had
    recently been involved in a shooting incident), Ellison’s specific pattern of veracity
    vis-à-vis his mother, and the fact that the evidence of the Statements could be
    consistent with Ellison deciding to lie to his mother to conceal some aspect of
    his activities or circumstances. Further, the trial judge failed to consider
    whether, in the light of these factors, the evidence of the Statements could
    reasonably be expected to have changed had Ellison been available for
    cross-examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, had the trial judge considered the foregoing matters, at most he would
    have concluded that Ellison’s motive for making the Statements was unclear and
    that, depending on his motive, the Statements could have been somewhat against
    his interest. Such a conclusion would not have contributed to a finding of
    threshold reliability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, in my view, the trial judge erred by founding his implicit
    conclusion that Ellison had no motive to fabricate on an absence of evidence of
    a motive to fabricate. The trial judge’s conclusion was based on rejecting the
    theory of fabrication posited by the preliminary inquiry judge. The fact that a
    theory of fabrication was rejected does not demonstrate that there was a proven
    absence of motive to fabricate. Unlike proven absence of motive to fabricate,
    absence of evidence of motive to fabricate is a neutral factor in the threshold
    reliability analysis. As this court explained in <i>Czibulka</i>, at paras. 44 and 45:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Lack of evidence of
    motive to fabricate is not equivalent to proved absence of motive to fabricate.
    In other words, a finding that there is simply no evidence one way or the other
    that the declarant had a motive to fabricate cannot be converted into a finding
    in favour of the proponent that the declarant had no motive to fabricate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Where absence of
    motive to fabricate is an important factor in resolving the reliability
    question I do not see how a trial judge could be satisfied the statements
    possessed “sufficient elements of reliability” in the absence of evidence of
    motive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in my view, the trial judge erred in the significance he afforded to the statements
    being against Ellison’s interest. As already noted, depending on whether
    Ellison had a motive to fabricate, the significance of this factor would vary.
    Moreover, Ellison’s admission to his mother would not meet the requirements of
    the traditional hearsay exception of being against Ellison’s penal interest
    (see <i>R. v. Demeter</i> (1975), 25 C.C.C.
    (2d) 417 (Ont. C.A.), affirmed (1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 137 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. O’Brien</i> (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 209
    (S.C.C.)), and therefore would not provide a guarantee of reliability. Even on
    a less formalized basis, Ellison’s admission was little more than confirmation
    of that which his mother already knew, or at least suspected.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    as noted by my colleague the trial judge misstated the test for admission of a
    hearsay statement under the principled approach when he said, “As to threshold
    reliability, the declarant’s statement to his mother was not made under
    inherently unreliable circumstances.” In my view, the trial judge’s reasons do
    not demonstrate that he subsequently applied the proper test. While he found
    there were some factors contributing to threshold reliability and at least one
    factor detracting from it, the trial judge did not express a conclusion
    concerning the weight of the various factors in terms that are different than
    the conclusion set out above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    in my view, the trial judge placed undue emphasis on the fact that Ms.
    Freckleton was available for cross-examination and on the inherent plausibility
    of Ellison telling more to his mother about the identity of the shooter than he
    told to the police as contributing in any way to the threshold reliability of
    the evidence of the Statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the fact that Ellison’s pattern of veracity vis-à-vis
    his mother and possible motivations to lie was accessible, at least indirectly
    through cross-examination of his mother went “some distance to substituting for
    cross-examination of the deceased declarant.” Given that there was evidence of
    Ellison being deceitful with his mother about his activities and associates,
    her availability for cross-examination was a poor substitute for what might be
    learned from Ellison about his motivation for making the Statements had he been
    available.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    while it may be inherently more plausible that a son would tell his mother more
    about the identity of an assailant than he would tell the police, I fail to see
    how that general proposition in any way enhances the likelihood that, on the
    specific facts of this case, Ellison was truthful in making the Statements to
    his mother. The fact that Ellison was not forthcoming with the police does not
    provide a guarantee that he told the truth to his mother.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    my analysis, the major hearsay danger arising from the evidence of the
    Statements is the issue of Ellison’s sincerity<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> and the fact that he is not available to be cross-examined concerning the
    truthfulness of the Statements. While I conclude that there is at least one
    factor detracting from the threshold reliability of the evidence of the
    Statements with respect to their sincerity (Ellison’s specific pattern of
    veracity vis-à-vis </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>his mother), in my view, there are
    no factors that “negate or at least ameliorate” that danger with respect to
    this evidence: see <i>R. v. Kimberley</i> (2001), 157 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (Ont. C.A.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    that respect, I do not agree that, on the facts of this case, the
    contemporaneity of the Statements in any way addresses the hearsay danger
    relating to sincerity. In this case, in my view, the timing of the Statements
    is a matter that goes solely to the hearsay dangers relating to the perception
    and memory of the declarant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    therefore conclude that the trial judge erred in his analysis of the threshold
    reliability of the evidence of the Statements and that on a proper analysis the
    Crown failed to demonstrate their threshold reliability. Accordingly, I would
    allow the appeal, set aside the appellant’s conviction and order a new trial. </p>
