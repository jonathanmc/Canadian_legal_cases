  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1987, Vince Lombardo and Sylvia Lombardo hired Progressive Drywall and Interior
    Systems to renovate their home.  Difficulties arose between the Lombardos
    and Progressive and, on September 24, 1987, an agreement was reached that
    Progressive would be released from the contract.  The renovation was to be
    completed by L &amp; F Contractors Co.  The Lombardos were to pay no more
    than $141,600, plus extras, for the complete renovation.  On completion of
    the work by L &amp; F, if the total paid by the Lombardos exceeded $141,600,
    plus agreed-upon extras, Progressive was to refund the excess to the Lombardos.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no need to recite the lengthy litigation that then ensued.  Suffice to
    say that for legitimate business reasons, in the summer of 1990, the decision
    was made to wind down Progressive.  Frank Caiazzo and Crescendo (“Enzo”)
    Romano incorporated Ritin Construction Inc. on October 23, 1990, in order
    to continue in the drywall business.  Beginning in November 1990, Progressive
    and Ritin operated out of Ritin property.  The intent was that Progressive
    would complete remaining jobs, collect its accounts receivable, pay its creditors
    and cease operating.  The Lombardos used this information to successfully
    move for an order in April 1991 requiring Progressive to post security for
    costs in a lien action it had commenced against the Lombardos.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 8, 1993, the Lombardos obtained default judgment against Progressive
    for alleged defects in the renovation.  The default judgment was for approximately
    $550,000.00.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Lombardos began this action in August 1996.  They alleged that the respondents,
    who were former officers, directors, shareholders or employees of Progressive,
    had conspired to cause Progressive to divest itself of its assets so as to
    prevent them from realizing on the default judgment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    judgment dated October 23, 2003, Salmers&nbsp;J. dismissed the Lombardos’ claim.  They
    appealed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of the oral hearing of the appeal, the panel advised the parties
    that the appeal was dismissed and that reasons would be forthcoming for that
    decision.  The following reasons explain why I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raise a large number of issues, the most central of which are:</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:

    of conspiracy?</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in
    light of the trial judge’s finding that Frank Caiazzo and Enzo Romano had
    acted unlawfully in relation to one or more of the conveyances of Progressive
    assets, were the appellants entitled to damages?</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:
normal;'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>was
    there a reasonable apprehension of bias in respect of the trial judge?  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>did
    the trial judge err in failing to find the Appugliesis, Nadia Romano and
    Susan Caiazzo liable? </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>are
    the appellants entitled to punitive damages? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent Frank Caiazzo took issue with the trial judge’s finding that he
    committed intentional wrongful acts during the windup of Progressive but
    his counsel advised the court at the oral hearing of the appeal that he was
    no longer pursuing that matter since the issue made no difference to the
    result.  Consequently, that issue is not addressed in these reasons.     <i> </i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.         ONE CAUSE OF ACTION
      OR MORE? <u></u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument, the appellants acknowledged that the only cause of action
    expressly pleaded in their Statement of Claim is that of the tort of conspiracy.  They
    also acknowledged that only the tort of conspiracy was argued below.  Nonetheless,
    they maintain that the elements necessary to maintain a claim of fraudulent
    preferences can be found in the Statement of Claim.  Therefore, they contend,
    it was incumbent on the trial judge to have determined which transactions
    involving assets of Progressive contravened the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.29 and it was an error for him to have failed
    to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept that the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i> is mentioned in paragraph
    28 of the Statement of Claim.  However, a plain reading of paragraph 28 shows
    that the <i>Act </i>is referred to for the purpose of advancing a claim based
    on the tort of conspiracy and not as an independent cause of action.  Paragraph
    28 of the Statement of Claim reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>28. The Plaintiff states that the object of the
    conspiracy pleaded in paragraph 27 herein namely to defeat, hinder, delay
    and defraud the Plaintiffs of monies to which the Plaintiffs were entitled
    was in itself unlawful.  Furthermore and in any event the Plaintiffs state
    that the overt acts referred to in paragraph&nbsp;25 herein and specifically
    as pleaded in paragraphs&nbsp;8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 26
    of the Statement of Claim were in themselves unlawful and in this connection
    the Plaintiffs plead and rely upon the provisions of Sections&nbsp;20 and
    38 of the <i>Business Corporations Act</i>, the provisions of the <i>Fraudulent
    Conveyance Act</i> and the <i>Assignment and Preferences Act</i>.  Furthermore
    the Plaintiffs state that each of the said conspirators are bound by all
    acts and omissions pleaded herein as against each of the other co&#8209;conspirators,
    all liability being joint and several.  In any event the Plaintiffs state
    that each of the defendants were aware of, acquiesced in, and aided and abetted
    the over acts as pleaded herein.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants did not plead or argue below any cause of action apart from conspiracy;
    it is not open to them to raise the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i>, as
    a cause of action, at this stage of the proceeding.  See <i>Rodaro v. Royal
    Bank of Canada</i> (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 74 (C.A.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    said that, the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances Act</i> would not have assisted
    the appellants in their claim for damages as, even if successful, the remedy
    available under the <i>Act</i> is limited to declaring improper transactions
    to be void.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.            ENTITLEMENT TO
      DAMAGES<u> </u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants say that the trial judge erred because he failed to calculate
    damages after finding that Frank Caiazzo and Enzo Romano had “fraudulently
    and conspiratorially” divested Progressive of its assets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin by noting that the trial judge did not find that Frank Caiazzo and
    Enzo Romano had committed fraud.  Rather, he found that they had engaged
    in unlawful conduct contrary to the provisions of the <i>Fraudulent Conveyances
    Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, I do not accept the appellants’ assertion that the trial judge
    so erred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge correctly articulated the law when he stated that proof of damages
    by the appellants is an essential element of the tort of conspiracy.  A conspiracy
    that does not result in damages is not actionable.  See <i>Canada Cement
    Lafarge Ltd. v. British Columbia Lightweight Aggregate Ltd.</i>, [1983] 1
    S.C.R. 452.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    the cases relied on by the appellants in which a determination of liability
    is made and there are difficulties in proving the quantum of damages, because
    the tort of conspiracy was the only cause of action pleaded, the appellants
    had to prove that they suffered damage as a result of the respondents’ conduct
    before liability could be found.  The appellants did not prove special damages
    resulting from the unlawful conduct of Mssrs.&nbsp;Caiazzo and Romano, as
    found by the trial judge.  Instead, they relied on the default judgment they
    had obtained in July&nbsp;1993.  They led no evidence to show that they would
    have been in any different position had the wrongful acts not occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this regard, I would adopt the reasons of the trial judge at para.&nbsp;124
    of his judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As previously stated, the accounting and financial
    evidence was very complicated, convoluted, and conflicting.&nbsp; When Progressive’s
    affairs were finalized, the evidence indicated that as between the various
    defendants, there were many trade-offs and balancing of interests and/or
    payments and other benefits received.&nbsp; Also, some acts were lawful and
    others were unlawful.&nbsp; Payments, including over $360,000 by the Appugliesis,
    were made to Progressive and to others for various reasons.&nbsp;
    Certain accounts receivable were not collected either because of compromise
    or simply because the debtor could not pay.&nbsp; To determine the sum made
    unavailable to the plaintiffs because of unlawful conduct would have required
    evidence analyzing all of these facts and all of the other relevant evidence.  There
    was no evidence of this type other than that of Mr. Ross and his evidence
    was insufficient for me to find that the plaintiffs have proven that any
    amount was made unavailable to them as a result of unlawful conduct of the
    defendants.&nbsp; Accordingly, I find that the plaintiffs have not proven
    their damages as against Mr. Caiazzo and Mr. Romano.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants acknowledged that the evidence at trial did not demonstrate that
    special damages had been proved to have resulted from the unlawful conduct
    of Mssrs.&nbsp;Caiazzo and Romano.  This concession, in my view, ends the
    debate.  However, I will briefly comment on the appellants’ arguments as
    to why the failure to prove special damages should not be fatal to their
    case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    they say that the matter could be sent back for a new trial in which the
    trial judge would decide which of Progressive’s transactions were unlawful.  Armed
    with those findings, the appellants would then be in a position to attempt
    to prove that special damages flowed from the wrongful transactions.  This
    argument amounts to permitting the appellants to have a second trial solely
    because they failed to discharge their burden of proof at the first trial.  While
    I accept that there are difficulties in proving such damages so many years
    after the events occurred, this is not a basis in law for ordering a new
    trial.  The burden of proof in this regard clearly lay on the appellants.  Having
    failed to discharge it at the first trial, absent an error of law requiring
    a new trial, they are not permitted to “try again”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellants seek to rely on the doctrine of <i>res ipsa loquitur</i> to
    attack the <i>bona fides </i>of all of Progressive’s transactions.  For the
    reasons already given, as this doctrine was not pleaded or argued below,
    we decline to allow the appellants to raise it now.  In any event, it is
    not clear to me how it might apply to the tort of conspiracy.  That said,
    the crux of this argument appears to be that the trial judge was obliged
    to find that all transactions between Progressive and the respondents were
    tainted and must be treated as void, given the trial judge’s finding that
    Mr.&nbsp;Caiazzo and Mr.&nbsp;Romano transferred one, or possibly more, assets
    of Progressive with the intent to defeat creditors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  I know of no principle of law that requires such a presumption.  In
    any event, the trial judge made findings that militate against such a presumption
    including that: the Appugliesis decided in June or July 1990 to leave Progressive
    for lawful reasons, Frank Caiazzo and Enzo Romano could not buy them out,
    the windup of Progressive followed as a consequence, and, the demise of Progressive
    and the related corporations was the result of the split in the ownership
    groups and the ongoing recession in the construction industry in the early
    1990s.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3.            REASONABLE APPREHENSION
      OF BIAS<u></u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      paragraph 20 of his reasons, the trial judge notes that the vast majority
      of the evidence on which the motion judge relied when granting default
      judgment in favour of the Lombardos were deemed admissions as a result
      of an unanswered request to admit.  He also noted that the request to admit
      was sent to an address for Progressive that both Mr. Lombardo and his counsel
      knew was no longer occupied by Progressive.  In para. 117 of the reasons,
      he notes again the issue in respect of the address and in para. 120 he
      says, “Further, having regard to the manner in which the facts were found
      in the summary judgment…”.  Based on these statements, the appellants argue
      that the test for disqualifying a judge based on a reasonable apprehension
      of bias has been met.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      see nothing in this argument.  The trial judge’s observations are accurate
      since, to the knowledge of the appellants, Progressive no longer occupied
      the premises.  In any event, the method of service of the request to admit
      had no impact on the outcome and was not used by the trial judge for any
      improper purpose.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      is no suggestion by any party that the trial was conducted in anything
      but a fair and impartial manner and the trial judge’s reasons are exemplary.  They
      carefully and correctly set out the governing legal principles.  They canvas
      the evidence in a thorough, well-organized manner so that it is clear what
      the trial judge found and why.  Given the morass of detailed evidence and
      the way that it was introduced, this was no small feat.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I

      appellants did not press their submission that the trial judge erred in
      failing to find the Appugliesis, Nadia Romano and Susan Caiazzo liable
      for unlawful acts.  Counsel indicated that this ground of appeal was advanced
      in order to “leave the door open” in the event that the court was inclined
      to entertain an argument based on the new cause of action of “knowing receipt”.</span></p>

      previously indicated, the court is not prepared to permit the appellants
      to raise a new cause of action at this point in the proceeding.  In any
      event, the doctrine of “knowing receipt” appears to have no place in this
      case given that it relates to the misappropriation of trust funds and there
      has been no allegation or finding that any funds paid out by Progressive
      were trust funds.</span></p>

      more need be said in relation to this issue apart from observing that it
      amounts to an invitation to retry the case.  The trial judge’s findings
      in respect to these persons are entitled to a high degree of deference.  He
      made no palpable and overriding error in this regard.  The trial judge
      was fully justified on the record to conclude that neither of the Appugliesis
      were directors of Progressive and that they did not have the knowledge
      or intent required to sustain a finding of unlawful conduct.  On the contrary,
      his findings lead to the conclusion that the Appugliesis conducted themselves
      properly, in good faith and in accordance with their legal obligations.</span></p>

      their factum, the appellants argue that the trial judge should have awarded
      punitive damages rather than require them “to pay the costs award of the
      perpetrators of the fraud”.  It bears repeating that the trial judge found
      the conduct of Mssrs. Caiazzo and Romano to be unlawful rather than fraudulent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      any event, I see no basis on which the appellants are entitled to punitive
      damages.  In <i>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Company</i>, [2002] S.C.C. 18,
      the Supreme Court of Canada explained that punitive damages are awarded
      in situations where compensatory damages are insufficient and are to be
      imposed only if there has been highly reprehensible behaviour.  In the
      present case, no order of compensatory damages was made and there was no
      finding of the type of reprehensible behaviour that might attract the sanction
      of punitive damages.  Consequently, punitive damages are not available
      and I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</span></p>
