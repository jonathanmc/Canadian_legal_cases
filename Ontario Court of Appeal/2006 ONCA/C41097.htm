    appellant appeals his conviction for the first-degree murder of his wife
    Shelly Cowell.  The appellant admitted to having unlawfully caused his wife’s
    death but the Crown did not accept his plea of guilty to manslaughter.  After
    a four-week trial before a judge and jury, the appellant was convicted of
    first-degree murder.</p>

line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the opening of oral argument before this court, counsel for the appellant
    abandoned the grounds of appeal with respect to the admissibility of a number
    of hearsay statements of the deceased and the trial judge’s instruction to
    the jury with respect to those statements. </p>

    appeal turns on the two remaining grounds.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       <i>Did the trial judge in err
        by refusing to admit a statement the accused made to his father?</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by refusing to admit a statement
    he made to his father within days of the death of his wife: “I killed Shelley.  I
    lost it.  I just lost it.”  The appellant submits that this statement should
    have been admitted as being relevant to his state of mind at the time he
    caused his wife’s death. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his opening statement, Crown counsel referred to the first part of the statement, “I
    killed Shelley”.  In turn, defence counsel referred to the words “I lost
    it.  I just lost it”.  The statement was never tendered during the trial
    and the trial judge was not asked to rule on its admissibility.  The trial
    judge did, however, make a general ruling that statements made by the accused
    and two others were not admissible at the behest of the accused on the basis
    of the general rule laid down in <i>R. v. Simpson</i> (1988), 38 C.C.C. (3d)
    481 (S.C.C.) that the out-of-court statements of the accused “are receivable
    in evidence against him but not for him”.  In his jury charge, the trial
    judge instructed the jury to disregard any reference to the appellant’s out-of-court
    statement as it had not been admitted in evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellant submits that the statement should have been admitted
    under the principled exception to the hearsay rule as evidence of his state
    of mind at the time he caused his wife’s death.  We are unable to accept
    that submission.  If this argument was to be made, it should have been made
    at trial.  In any event, assuming for the sake of argument that in the circumstances
    in which it was made, the statement met the threshold test for reliability,
    the necessity requirement is plainly not met.  We do not agree with the submission
    that it should have been admitted on the basis that it was the best evidence,
    the quality of which cannot be replicated, of the appellant’s state of mind
    at the time he caused his wife’s death.  The appellant was available to testify
    at his trial and to offer in full detail his version as to his mental state
    at the time he caused his wife’s death.  He chose not to do so and not to
    subject himself to cross-examination.  Even on the most generous application
    of the necessity requirement, we fail to see how this statement could be
    admitted.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       <i>Did the trial judge err in
        his instruction to the jury regarding post-offence conduct?</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial Crown made only brief reference to the significance of appellant’s
    post-offence conduct.  The appellant’s trial counsel, however, submitted
    that the appellant’s post-offence conduct was inconsistent with a planned
    and deliberate murder.  The trial judge instructed the jury that post-offence
    conduct could in some cases indicate guilt but that in other cases there
    could be an innocent explanation for the conduct:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In this case…you
    might not find this evidence to be of much assistance as evidence of consciousness
    of guilt.  That is because the accused has already admitted that he wrongfully
    killed his wife, and is therefore guilty of manslaughter.  The extent that
    his behaviour looks like the behaviour of a guilty man, that could be explained
    as the actions of a man who knows he is guilty of having committed manslaughter.  You
    might not find his behaviour of much assistance in determining whether he
    is guilty of first or second-degree murder.  Once again is for you to decide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    on his instructions, the trial judge outlined the defence theory with respect
    to the post-offence conduct.  There was no objection to this aspect of the
    charge at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by failing to give a “no probative
    value” instruction: see <i>R. v. White and Coté</i> (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d)
    385 (S.C.C.).  We disagree.  As the Crown did not place any significant reliance
    on the post-offence conduct, it might have been preferable for the trial
    judge to have simply put the defence position to the jury.  However, we cannot
    say that the manner in which he chose to instruct the jury on this issue
    caused any significant prejudice to the appellant.  The instruction cautioned
    the jury about the danger of drawing an improper adverse inference from the
    post-offence conduct.  A “no probative value” instruction could have undercut
    the appellant’s reliance on post-offence conduct as being exculpatory.  In
    our view, on balance, the trial judge dealt with this issue fairly and we
    see no basis for appellate intervention.</p>
