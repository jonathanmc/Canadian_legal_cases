  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>    The appeal and cross-appeal arise out of a complicated real estate
      investment scheme involving the acquisition and redevelopment of a Calgary
      apartment complex known as Place Concorde.  The trial judge dismissed the
      individual plaintiffs' request for rescission of their investment contracts
      and dismissed their claim for damages of $10,684,000, payable pro rata
      to the individual plaintiffs, against the defendant property development
      company, Shelter Corporation (Shelter).<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>    The individual plaintiffs were investors in two 1989 public offerings
      involving the acquisition and redevelopment of an apartment complex in
      Calgary.  Pursuant to the terms of the offerings, they became limited partners
      in a project to redevelop the complex (the individual plaintiffs are referred
      to as the Limited Partners).  Shelter, the promoter of the offerings,
      ran into serious cash flow problems and by 1994, it lost the project in
      foreclosure proceedings by the mortgagor of the property (who is not a
      party to these proceedings).  The Limited Partners interests in the project
      were extinguished by judicial order in 1994.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>    The trial judge concluded that the Limited Partners loss of their
      units in the project </span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>was caused by Shelters breaches of numerous contractual commitments
      in the prospectuses and related documents.  However, she also concluded
      that there was no basis at common law or in equity to justify granting
      the Limited Partners claim for rescission of the contracts.  Moreover,
      she held that the Limited Partners had not suffered any provable damages
      in the form of loss of capital appreciation, or loss of income.  In this
      regard, the trial judge held that even if Shelter had fulfilled all of
      its contractual commitments, the project was too heavily leveraged to allow
      it to be refinanced in the prevailing market conditions.  She concluded
      that the Limited Partners would have to have sold the project in 1994 at
      an amount that would have been insufficient to cover existing obligations
      owing from the sale proceeds.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>    In addition to dismissing the Limited Partners claim for rescission
      and damages, the trial judge refused their request to deliver up to them
      certain promissory notes that they had given to Shelter as part of the
      consideration for acquiring their interests in the project.  These notes
      were sold or assigned by Shelter in 1991 and 1992 to the other defendants
      in the main action, Barclays Bank and Household Trust (respondents/cross-appellants,
      the
    Financial Institutions).  The trial judge concluded that the Limited Partners
    were liable on the notes for the final payment due thereon and granted judgment
    in favour of the Financial Institutions on their cross-claim for the unpaid
    amounts.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>    The Limited Partners appeal the trial judges order dismissing
      their request for rescission and dismissing their claim for damages.  They
      also appeal the trial judges </span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>order refusing their request that the Financial Institutions redeliver
      the promissory notes.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>    On their cross-appeal, the Financial Institutions seek to vary
      the judgment in two respects.  First, they cross-appeal from the trial
      judges conclusion that if the Limited Partners had established damages,
      they would have had a right of equitable set-off against the obligations
      arising under the promissory notes.  Their second ground of appeal relates
      to the trial judges conclusion that the default interest rate in the promissory
      notes should be set aside as an unenforceable penalty and be replaced with
      the interest rate provided for in the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O.
      1990, c. C-43<i>.</i></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>    For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal to the limited
      extent that I would award nominal damages of $1 in favour of each appellant
      for Shelters breach of contract.  I would dismiss the cross-appeal.</span></p>

      1994.   A strong argument can be made that these commitments ought not
      to have been given, but having done so, Shelter must bear the responsibility
      of those commitments.  Had those commitments been fulfilled, the Project
      would not have been lost in August 1993.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that

      the third issue, the trial judge observed that the Limited Partners were
      seeking two alternative remedies: rescission and the attendant relief of
      repayment of monies paid, and damages.  She explained the distinction between
      rescission at common law and equitable rescission</span><span lang=EN-GB>.  With
      respect to the former, she noted that the agreement was not voidable at
      the option of the Limited Partners and thus rescission at common law was
      not available.  Turning to rescission in equity, she said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[N]one of the traditional grounds such as fraud,
    misrepresentation or unconscionable conduct which serve to invoke the courts
    jurisdiction are present.  Additionally, I am not persuaded that the courts

    or that it would be practically just to do so (at para. 208).</p>

      trial judge stated that even if equitable rescission were available, it
      should not be granted because it was not possible to restore the parties
      to their pre-contractual positions.  She referred to <i>Kingu v. Walma
      Ventures Ltd.</i> (1996), 10 B.C.L.R. (2d) 15 at 21 (C.A.) for the following
      three barriers to rescission:  lack of prompt action by the plaintiffs;
      acquisition of rights by innocent third parties; and the impossibility
      of restoring the parties to their pre-contractual position.  In this case,
      the Limited Partners had derived benefits from the investment in the form
      of tax relief, which was one of the purposes of the investment.  The trial
      judge concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It seems to me that the claims of the plaintiffs

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-GB>While I have determined that Shelters
      failure to make the requisite tax payments and to continue to make cash
      flow loans caused the Project to be lost, it seems to me that at best,
      the Limited Partners suffered a loss of chance or opportunity to receive
      income and experience capital appreciation.  I must then consider whether
      the chance constituted some reasonable probability of realizing an advantage
      of some real substantial monetary value as described by Griffiths J.A.

      main issue concerning damages was whether the Limited Partners suffered
      a loss of chance to experience capital appreciation as a result of Shelters
      breaches of the various commitments to the Limited Partners.   On this
      issue, the trial judge accepted the opinion of the Financial Institutions experts,
      that in December 1994, there would have been inadequate proceeds of sale
      such that the Limited Partners exposure on the promissory notes would
      have been reduced.  She said that, [i]n reaching this determination, one
      must examine the cash outflows before any note repayment and the value
      of the Project had it been renovated as contemplated in the prospectus (at
      para. 228).</span></p>

      trial judge accepted the Financial Institutions expert opinion that the
      revenue shortfall suffered by the project was primarily because market
      conditions were much worse than what had been projected.  The trial judge
      did not put an estimated value on the project had it been renovated as
      of the Maturity Date of October 31, 1994.  Nor did she make a finding on
      what the net operating income would have been had Shelter not breached
      its commitments.  She was satisfied, however, that the net operating income
      would not have been sufficient to generate a value in excess of the required
      outflows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I conclude that even if the renovations had been
    completed by February, 1991 as contemplated by the prospectuses, the Project
    would have continued to suffer significant cash flow shortfalls. It would
    not have achieved a net operating income in 1994 that would have resulted
    in a value in excess of the required outflows. This is the case whether a
    10% or an 8% capitalization rate is used. Having said that, I accept the
    opinion of the experts for the Financial Institutions that a 10% capitalization
    rate was more appropriate. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I conclude that the Limited Partners suffered no
    damages as a result of any loss of capital appreciation. It is not credible
    in my view that the property would have a value that would cover the outflows
    including the mortgages, Shelter's cash flow loans, commissions, and structural
    repairs costs<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[6]</span></a>.
     The Limited Partners showed no proclivity to contribute additional capital
    and in my view, they would not have done so. Even if Shelter had performed
    all of its commitments, the only realistic alternative available to the Limited
    Partners would have been a sale of the Project in 1994 (at paras. 237 and
    238).</p>

      went on to consider whether the Limited Partners could have obtained refinancing
      of the project in 1994.  She concluded that they could not have done so:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Regardless of the balloon payment requirement [on
    the promissory notes], the cash flow generated from the renovated units would
    be inadequate to service any new or renewed facilities whether the capitalization
    rate was 8% or 10%.  In addition, there would have had to be financing for
    the post tension structural repairs.  It seems to me that at a minimum, financing
    would have to cover $1,130,000 on account of post tension structural repairs....  Furthermore,
    there would have to be a source of funding for future cash flow deficiencies.  Shelter's
    commitment to provide cash flow loans and to guarantee the large Montreal
    Trust mortgage had expired by 1995 and in any event, the company had failed
    by 1994.  I conclude that financing would not have been available in 1994
    and the Project would have been sold in any event.  The plaintiffs would
    be in the same position as they are today.  The Project and their investment
    would be gone with nothing to reduce their exposure on the notes.  There
    was no reasonable probability of realizing an advantage of some real substantial
    monetary value (at para. 241).</p>

      for legal set-off.<b>  </b>The trial judge observed that equitable set-off
      may be available to a debtor even where the debt has been assigned to a

      rate of the prime commercial lending rate (Prime) plus 1.75% before default,

      stepped up by 4.25%.  The trial judge concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The default rate was in the nature of a penalty.  It

    that the defendants had repudiated the prospectuses and Material Contracts,
    nor was there a specific request to be excused from the future performance

      to address this issue in her judgment.  They say that repudiation was included

      instead argue that the fundamental breach by Shelter of its contractual
      commitments absolved them from their future obligations on the promissory

      Contracts, thereby entitling the Limited Partners to elect to be relieved
      from any future performance obligations, most notably their obligations
      to pay on the promissory notes.  On the contrary, the Limited Partners case,

      speculate in the Calgary real estate market and thus obtain the benefits
      of capital appreciation, should they occur, and second, that they received
      the tax shelter benefits contemplated by their investment.  Shelter, they

      [1999] 3 S.C.R. 423.  Rescission is a remedy available to the innocent
      party when the other party has made a false or misleading representation.  Rescission
      allows for the rescinding party to treat the contract as if it were void <i>ab
      initio</i>.  Speaking for the court, Iacobucci and Bastarache JJ. endorsed
      the following definition of rescission from Lord Atkinson in <i>Abram Steamship

      future breaches.  Alternatively, the innocent party can elect to accept
      the repudiation and the contract is terminated.  Each party is then discharged
      from future obligations: <i>Gordon Capital</i> at para. 40.</span></p>

      a repudiatory breach does not automatically bring an end to a contract.  Rather,
      it confers a right upon the innocent party to elect to treat the contract
      at an end thereby relieving the parties from further performance.  As a
      general rule, the innocent party must make an election and communicate
      it to the repudiating party within a reasonable time: see <i>Chapman v.
      Ginter</i> [1968] S.C.R. 560 at 568.  However, in some cases the election
      to treat the contract at an end will be found to have been sufficiently
      communicated by the innocent partys conduct: John D. McCamus, <i>The Law
      of Contracts</i>, (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2005) at pp. 641-42.</span></p>

      occurs in circumstances where the breach deprives the innocent party of
      substantially the whole benefit that it was intended he or she should have
      obtained from the contract: <i>Hunter Engineering Co. v. Syncrude Canada
      Ltd., </i>[1989] 1 S.C.R. 426 at 499-500.  A breach that allows the non-repudiating
      party to elect to put an end to all unperformed obligations of the parties
      is an exceptional remedy that is available only in circumstances where
      the entire foundation of the contract has been undermined, that is, where
      the very thing bargained for has not been provided: see <i>Hunter Engineering,
      supra</i>; see also <i>Gordon Capital,</i> <i>supra</i>, at para. 50.</span></p>

      Limited Partners
    case as pleaded in their statement of claim and as argued at trial was that
    rescission was available to them because of the fundamental nature of the
    defendants various breaches of the terms of the prospectuses and related
    contracts. In other words, the plaintiffs relied on fundamental breach as
    an element of their claim for rescission.  Alternatively, the Limited Partners

      Limited Partners advanced their case on the basis of rescission throughout
      the trial.  In the plaintiffs Closing Argument Brief submitted to the
      trial judge, there was one passing reference to repudiation.  The reference
      is under the heading
    Rescission and follows the submission that rescission is available as a
    remedy where the breaches go to the root of the contract: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, the breaches of Shelter justify rescission
    of the investment contract of the Limited Partners.  The guarantees and commitments
    of Shelter were a fundamental aspect of the investment.  In essence, Shelter
    said, rely on us, we wont let the Project fail.  Further, the breaches
    led to the loss of the entire object of the investment project, the Place
    Concorde project.  The breaches truly went to the root of the contract.  <i>Lastly,
    the number, seriousness, and repetitive nature of the breaches was anything
    but incidental
     it reflected a pattern of conduct that was a complete repudiation by Shelter
    of the offering and its commitments and guarantees </i>[emphasis added].</p>

      been in had the contract not been made.  In this case, restoration entails
      the return of the Notes, and all amounts paid on the Notes... Rescission

      trial judge was not asked to consider whether Shelters breaches of the
      terms of the prospectuses and related contracts amounted to a substantial
      breach such as would justify future non-performance of the Limited Partners obligations.  She
      was therefore not asked to consider, nor did she consider, the five factors
      that guide a courts determination of this issue as set out by Weiler J.A.
      in <i>Vernon, supra</i>. Furthermore, the trial judge was not asked to
      decide whether the Limited Partners by their words or conduct had elected
      to accept Shelters repudiation.  The Limited Partners are attempting to
      reargue their case in a way that was not advanced at trial and to achieve
      under the guise of fundamental breach entitling them to treat the contract
      as terminated, the same relief they failed to achieve through their claim

        to plead or argue at trial that a contract was too vague to be enforceable,
        it would not be appropriate for the court to address the argument on
        appeal, even if it may have merit.  In my view, it would similarly not
        be appropriate for the court to allow the appeal on the basis of the
        doctrine of repudiation where the appellants did not advance their case
        on that footing at trial or in their pleadings.  As Doherty J.A. for
        the Court stated in <i>Rodaro v. Royal Bank of Canada</i> (2002), 59
        O.R. (3d) 74 at para. 60, It is fundamental to the litigation process

      reason for rejecting the Limited Partners argument that they should have
      been excused from future performance of their obligations based on repudiation
      is that, in my view, they have not established the unreasonableness of
      the trial judges conclusion that Shelters breaches were not fundamental.  In
      dismissing the Limited Partners claim for rescission, the trial judge
      observed that, [i]n any event, I do not view Shelters breaches as <i>fundamental
      or going to the root of the contract</i> as alleged by the Limited Partners [emphasis
      added].  The trial judge came to this conclusion having found that Shelter
      breached various commitments owed to the Limited Partners, including the
      following:  to make timely payment of partnership obligations to third
      parties, to make cash flow loans for operating purposes, to perform substantial
      renovations, to guarantee repayment of the second mortgage, and to fulfil
      various reporting obligations.  The trial judge found that Shelters breaches
      caused the Limited Partners to lose their investment in the project.  She
      rejected the Financial Institutions argument that the downturn in the
      economy was the intervening factor that caused the project to fail.</span></p>

      Shelters breaches were very serious.  However, in my view, the trial judges
      holding that Shelters breaches were not fundamental and did not go to
      the root of the contract was available to her on the evidence and I would
      not interfere with it.  Her conclusion on this issue applies to defeat
      the new claim asserted by the Limited Partners on this appeal that Shelter
      repudiated the investment contracts.</span><span lang=EN-GB> I would point
      to three discrete areas that support the trial judges finding.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>First,
      the trial judge accepted that Shelter paid all proceeds of the promissory
      notes against authorized expenses for the project as set out in the prospectuses,
      namely, building, land and development costs.  She further accepted that
      the proceeds from the two offerings were used to pay for closing and development
      costs and that insufficient funds were available after closing to pay all
      expenses and fees in full.  The evidence supported these findings. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Second,
      as found by the trial judge, Shelter made sizable expenditures and cash
      flow loans in respect of the project, until Shelter failed financially
      due to a serious downturn in the local and national economies.  The risks
      of a serious market decline on a heavily-leveraged project and of Shelters
      own financial failure were assumed by the Limited Partners on the terms
      of the prospectuses and did not constitute a substantial failure of performance.  There
      were numerous warnings to investors of the risks associated with this investment
      in the prospectuses, including that the Limited Partners were relying on
      Shelters continuing ability to honour its commitments with respect to
      the management and operation of the Limited Partnership and that the Limited
      Partners were fully liable on the promissory notes and severally liable
      on the second mortgage in the event of default.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Third,
      and significantly, Shelter indicated in the prospectuses that the investment
      was an opportunity for the Limited Partners to earn income, participate
      in capital appreciation, and take advantage of income tax deferrals. The
      project did not earn income because of Shelters breaches.  However, the
      Limited Partners did receive an interest in the project that entitled them
      to benefit from capital appreciation in value if the market went up.  Unfortunately
      the market did not go up.  Nonetheless, this benefit was a significant
      element of which the plaintiffs bargained for and got. Finally, the Limited
      Partners admitted that they took whatever tax benefits were available to
      them.  By 1993, those Limited Partners in the top marginal tax bracket
      were not significantly out of pocket as a result of their investment
      in the project (at para. 119).  There was thus ample evidence to support
      the trial judges findings that the investment was developed in part as
      a tax shelter and the Limited Partners derived benefits in that regard (at
      para. 210).  In light of these circumstances, it cannot be said that the
      entire foundation of the contract was undermined.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Moreover,
      even assuming that Shelters breaches of the prospectuses and related contracts
      were fundamental and thus amounted to an act of repudiation, in my opinion,
      it cannot reasonably be inferred from the proven circumstances, including
      the conduct of the Limited Partners, that they elected to accept the repudiation
      and to treat the contractual arrangements at an end.  The Limited Partners
      did not address in their written submissions at trial or on appeal what
      words or conduct of the Limited Partners, either on an individual or collective
      basis, constituted an election to accept Shelters repudiation; they were
      seeking rescission and damages.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>On
      appeal, counsel for the Limited Partners submitted in oral argument that
      the service of the statement of claim on the respondents provided timely
      notice of the Limited Partners election to accept Shelters repudiation.   I
      am prepared to assume without deciding that an election to accept a repudiation
      can be made through the issuance or service of a statement of claim by
      the non-repudiating party.   However, even with that assumption, there
      is nothing in the wording of the claim that indicated an election to accept
      the respondents repudiation.  The various orders requested by the Limited
      Partners reflect their position that the prospectuses and related contracts
      were void <i>ab initio</i> on the basis of the doctrine of rescission.  </span></p>

      it would strain any reasonable interpretation to conclude that this pleading
      constituted an election to treat the prospectuses or the promissory notes
      at an end and to be released from future obligations.  Indeed, paragraph
      1(c), cited above at para. 56, is inconsistent with such an election.  The
      Limited Partners did not seek to be excused from future performance on
      the notes, but rather sought an order permitting them to pay the balance
      due to the ELP and WLP instead of to the Shelter defendants or to the Financial
      Institutions.</span></p>

      went on to consider whether the chance constituted some reasonable probability of
      realizing an advantage of some real substantial monetary value as described
      by Griffiths J.A. in <i>Eastwalsh Homes, supra</i>, at p. 687<i>.  </i>She
      was satisfied that the net operating income of the project would not have
      been sufficient to generate a value in excess of the required outflows
      and that there was no loss of income for the years 1991 to 1994.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      Limited Partners primary position in this regard is that, in the unlikely
      event that the project could not have been refinanced on the Maturity
      Date of October 31, 1994, Shelter would have had to repay the Montreal
      Trust mortgage pursuant to its guarantee.  This argument ignores the fact
      that under the terms of the prospectuses, as well as in the Agreement to
      Assume Second Mortgage and the Limited Partnership Agreement, the Limited
      Partners assumed a <i>pro rata</i> share of the Montreal Trust second mortgage
      for $15,800,000.  Thus, had Shelter performed its guarantee to repay the
      second mortgage, it would have had a right of subrogation against the Limited
      Partners for the amount paid:  <i>Canadian Financial Co. v. First Federal

      refinanced in 1994 had Shelter performed its commitments.  They say that
      the trial judge erred in finding that the required amount of refinancing
      would have had to cover over $27 million in cash outflows on the Maturity
      Date, including an allowance for the cost of repairing structural problems
      affecting the project, the cash flow loan amount owed by the Limited Partners
      to Shelter, as well as sales commissions owed to Shelter and third parties.  In
      their view, the only debts that needed to be refinanced were the previously
      refinanced first mortgage in the amount of $5.1 million and the Montreal
      Trust mortgage of $15,252,400, for a total refinancing amount of $20,352,400.</span></p>

      have premised their submissions on an unrealistically low refinancing amount

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      general rule is that nominal damages may be given in all cases of breach
      of contract and in torts actionable <i>per se</i>: see H. McGregor, <i>McGregor
      on Damages, </i>17<sup>th</sup> ed<i>.</i>, (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell,
      2003) at para. 10-006.  Thus, while nominal damages for a proven breach
      might follow, it is open to the court in an appropriate case to decline
      to award even nominal damages where there is a proven breach of contract: <i>Serban
      v. Egolf &amp;
    Anas Associates</i> (1983), 43 B.C.L.R. 209 at 214 (S.C.).</span></p>

      this case, the trial judge held that the Limited Partners failed to prove
      any damages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
lang=EN-US>She did not go on to consider whether nominal damages should be awarded
      because the Limited Partners were successful in proving that Shelter breached
      the investment contracts.  In my view, the trial judge erred in failing
      to consider whether to make such an award.   Given the egregious nature
      of the breaches, <i>albeit</i> that no general damages flowed </span>therefrom,<span lang=EN-US> this
      was an appropriate case for doing so.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>As
      found by the trial judge, Shelter breached the majority of the commitments
      that it made to the investors in the prospectuses and related contracts.   An
      award of nominal damages is appropriate in these circumstances because
      the Limited Partners successfully made out their claim for breach of contract.  I
      agree with the view expressed by Professor Waddams that the amount to be
      awarded should be $1:  see S.M. Waddams, <i>The Law of Damages</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed.
      (Toronto: Canada Law Book Inc., 2004) at para. 10.30.    Such an award
      recognizes that the Limited Partners successfully established a breach
      of contract.  In light of this limited success, the Limited Partners should
      be entitled to their costs of the trial of their action:  see <i>The Law
      of Damages</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 10.10 and <i>Marsh v. Royal Bank
      of Canada</i> (1922), 63 D.L.R. 659 at 662 (Sask. C.A.).    Since I would
      award nominal damages, as opposed to true damages, the Limited Partners
      should be entitled to their costs of the action regardless of any offers
      to settle that may have been made.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CROSS-APPEAL</span></h4>

      are two distinct grounds to the cross-appeal of the Financial Institutions:
      (i) was equitable set-off available to the Limited Partners; and (ii) was
      the default rate of interest in the promissory notes an unenforceable penalty?  The
      trial judge answered both questions in the affirmative and the Financial
      Institutions say she erred in so doing.</span></p>

      my opinion, there is no merit in this ground of the cross-appeal.  It relates
      to the trial judges <i>obiter</i> statement that she would have allowed
      the Limited Partners to set-off their damages against the amounts due on
      the promissory notes had she found any damages.  </span></p>

      that she committed no error in coming to this conclusion.  Her order does
      not include any declaration in respect of set-off and an appeal or cross-appeal
      is from the trial judges order, not the reasons.  My conclusion that the
      Limited Partners are entitled to nominal damages of $1 has no practical
      implication in the context of a right of set-off against the Financial
      Institutions multi-million dollar claim on the promissory notes. </span></p>

      default, and Prime plus 6% after default.  Thus, on default, the interest
      rate was stepped up by 4.25%.  The trial judge relied on the House of Lords
      decision in <i>Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. New Garage and Motor Co</i>.,
      [1915] A.C. 79 for the principle that a contractual provision that is a
      genuine pre-estimate of damages will be enforced, but one in the nature

      O.R. (3d) 362 (C.A.), this Court held that the default clause in issue
      was not a penalty, but a forfeiture, and thus declined to determine if
      the court retains a residual discretion to enforce a penalty clause (at
      para. 36).  This question, which was left open in <i>Peachtree II</i>,
      was not argued at trial, nor did the Financial Institutions plead or rely
      on s. 98 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>.  Moreover, it is implicit
      in the trial judges decision that she would not have enforced the penalty,
      having found that the default rate was extravagant and unconscionable.   </span></p>

      the issue of what rate of interest applied to money owing on a promissory
      note after the maturity date, where the note only specified the interest
      rate up to the maturity date.  This decision accordingly does not support
      the argument that the trial judge erred in substituting the default rate
