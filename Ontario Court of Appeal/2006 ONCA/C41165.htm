      respondent Derek Cameron was charged that on December&nbsp;4,&nbsp;1999
      he intentionally or recklessly caused damage by fire to his apartment.  On
      September&nbsp;11,&nbsp;2003, he was acquitted by Gans J., presiding without
      a jury.  The Crown appeals against the acquittal on the ground that the
      trial judge erred in law in excluding the evidence of the Fire Marshall,
      Robert Young, when illness prevented him from completing his testimony
      and in precluding the Crown from calling Michael Rochon as its final witness.  The
      Crown also seeks leave to appeal from the trial judge’s order that it pay
      the respondent’s costs consequent to the late disclosure of Mr. Rochon’s
      report respecting the cause of fire.</span></p>

      fire destroyed the respondent’s apartment on the evening of December 4,
      1999.  After the fire was extinguished, police and investigators from the
      Fire Marshall’s Office arrived on the scene in the early morning of December
      5th, 1999.  Shortly thereafter, adjusters on behalf of both the respondent’s
      insurance company and the landlord’s insurance company also came to conduct
      independent investigations of the cause of the fire.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      respondent was ultimately charged with arson contrary to s. 433 of the <i>Criminal
      Code.</i>  While it is not necessary to set out a detailed description
      of the trial proceedings, it is important to note that the trial was protracted.  By
      the time it was terminated by the respondent’s acquittal, the trial had
      occupied 32 days over about 10 months from November 18, 2002 to September
      11, 2003.  This time was equally divided between the presentation of evidence
      by the Crown and legal arguments concerning several issues.  The Crown’s
      case included evidence given by police officers, firefighters, neighbours,
      an insurance adjuster, and the respondent’s former wife.  The Crown called
      fifteen witnesses before calling Mr. Robert Young, a certified fire investigator
      employed by the Fire Marshall’s Office, toward the close of its case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      Crown originally intended to call Mr. Young as its only expert witness.  Because
      he investigated the scene soon after the fire was extinguished, he was
      a key witness for the Crown.  The Crown’s case against the respondent turned
      primarily on his expert evidence regarding the cause of the fire.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      his direct examination, Mr. Young testified that the fire was incendiary.  In
      his view, someone deliberately poured several litres of gasoline at multiple
      points in the apartment, and ignited the gas accelerant.  During his testimony,
      however, the Crown discovered a pre&#8209;existing report prepared by investigative
      engineers that detailed the origin and cause of the fire.  This report
      was prepared on behalf of the landlord’s insurer, and essentially bolstered
      the Crown’s theory of arson.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      report was prepared by Michael Rochon.  Mr.&nbsp;Rochon first investigated
      the scene two days after the fire was extinguished, which was subsequent
      to Mr.&nbsp;Young’s investigation.  The Crown discovered the report’s existence
      at this stage of the trial while perusing the file of the landlord’s insurance
      adjuster which had been produced consequent to an application by the respondent.  On
      seeing a brief reference to the report in the file, the Crown asked for,
      and obtained, a copy of it.  The Crown sought to tender the report into
      evidence on the 19</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>th </span><span lang=EN-US>day of the trial, even
      though it was not provided to the respondent before trial as required by
      s.&nbsp;657(3)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The Crown also intended
      to call Mr.&nbsp;Rochon after Mr.&nbsp;Young had completed his testimony
      to give <i>viva voce</i> evidence concerning the report.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      defence was provided with a copy of the “Rochon Report” within hours of
      its receipt by the Crown.  The defence objected to the introduction of
      the report, and moved to exclude it on the basis that it was either manifestly
      unfair to tender the report near the close of the Crown’s case or because
      it infringed the respondent’s s.&nbsp;7 and s.&nbsp;11(d) <i>Charter </i>right
      to make full answer and defence.  In essence, the defence argued that it
      was prohibited from making full answer and defence by the late discovery
      of the report.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge ultimately dismissed the respondent’s motion to exclude the
      Rochon Report.  He was satisfied that the Crown was not at fault in respect
      to the late production of the report, which contained relevant evidence.  He
      was also satisfied that any potential prejudice to the respondent arising
      from the production of the report at this late stage of the trial would
      be cured by an adjournment to permit the respondent’s expert to reconsider
      his opinion in light of this new evidence.  Although he made no finding
      of misconduct on the Crown’s part, the trial judge awarded costs against
      the Crown to compensate the defence expert for any changes to his report
      occasioned by the new evidence.  The amount of the costs could not be determined
      until the defence expert submitted his account.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      his reasons of April 10, 2003 for awarding costs, the trial judge explained:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am of the view…that an award of costs can be
    meted out, albeit very rarely, pursuant to s. 24 [of the <i>Charter</i>]
    if the Defence establishes that costs would not have been incurred but for
    the late disclosure on the part of the Crown.  I prefer…the minority decision
    of Berger J.A. in <i>R. v. Robinson, supra,</i> where His Lordship held that
    s. 24 is intended to be restorative in nature and is designed to put the
    Accused in the same position had the <i>Charter</i> breach not taken place.   </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accordingly, I am persuaded that the Accused is
    entitled to be compensated for the incremental costs that would not have
    been incurred had the disclosure been made before their expert was retained
    and commenced an analysis on all aspects of the Crown’s case now put in issue
    by the Rochon Report and anticipated in the testimony of the engineer proposed
    to be called.</p>
  <p class=NoPara style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge
      further explained in a subsequent ruling dated June 25, 2003 that his costs
      order was “in some measure tied to my finding that the police knew that
      Rochon Engineering had been retained by the building owner’s insurers and
      were in the process of preparing an analysis of the root cause [of] the
      fire”, a finding that was, in my view, correctly challenged by the Crown
      on the ground that it was not supported by the evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial was adjourned after the April 10, 2003 ruling.  Subsequent to this
      ruling, the Crown proposed to call two or three minor witnesses and Michael
      Rochon as an additional arson expert before resting.  When the trial resumed
      after a four month delay, Mr. Young was on sick leave and could not attend
      for the completion of his cross-examination.  Neither the Crown nor the
      defence was aware that Mr. Young had been suffering from an illness prior
      to April 2003.  Because testifying in court would be considerably detrimental
      to his health, Mr.&nbsp;Young was unavailable to be cross-examined on issues
      raised by the newly disclosed Rochon Report.  Both the Crown and the defence
      acknowledged that Mr.&nbsp;Young would be incapable of returning to court
      for at least a year, and that there was a strong possibility that he would
      never be able to complete his testimony.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      light of these developments, the respondent sought to exclude both Mr.&nbsp;Young’s
      testimony in its entirety, and to preclude the Crown from introducing the
      Rochon Report and the <i>viva voce</i> testimony of Mr.&nbsp;Rochon.  During
      argument, the Crown urged the trial judge to refrain from excluding Mr.&nbsp;Young’s
      testimony altogether, and to accord it less weight instead.  After taking
      certain factors into consideration that will be discussed more fully below,
      the trial judge rejected the Crown’s argument, and noted the following:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Crown counsel] first argued that the appropriate
    ameliorative action in the instant case is for me to exercise my discretion
    and place less weight on the expert evidence offered by Mr.&nbsp;Young…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Respectfully, that bromide, as it were, doesn’t
    carry the day in a situation of this nature where the evidence is central
    to the matters in issue…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he Court should be loath to pick and choose
    the evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Young in the abstract.  This exercise would be manifestly
    unfair to the Accused and in my view might actually create an intended reverse
    onus.  Simply put, the prejudice to the Accused would not be ameliorated
    by this process. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, the evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Young must
    be excluded in its entirety. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following
      his exclusion of Mr.&nbsp;Young’s evidence, the trial judge re&#8209;visited
      his April&nbsp;10,&nbsp;2003 ruling permitting the Crown to introduce the
      Rochon Report through Mr.&nbsp;Rochon, notwithstanding the report’s late
      production.  As I understand the trial judge’s reasons, he precluded the
      Crown from tendering Mr.&nbsp;Rochon’s expert evidence respecting the cause
      of the fire because to do so would infringe the respondent’s right to a
      fair trial since the respondent would be unable to cross&#8209;examine
      Mr.&nbsp;Young on the Rochon Report.  The trial judge added that to permit
      the Crown to introduce the Rochon evidence after the exclusion of Mr.&nbsp;Young’s
      evidence would confer a benefit on the Crown.  From the trial judge’s reasons
      it appears that he speculated that Mr.&nbsp;Rochon’s evidence could benefit
      the Crown if it was introduced without the defence being given the opportunity
      to cross&#8209;examine Mr.&nbsp;Young on the Rochon Report.  The trial
      judge appeared to be of the view that Mr.&nbsp;Rochon’s prospective testimony
      as to the fire’s cause that would reflect the opinion in the report was
      much stronger than that of Mr.&nbsp;Young and would be very helpful to
      the Crown.  It is clear from my reading of the trial judge’s reasons that
      he excluded both Mr.&nbsp;Young’s and Mr.&nbsp;Rochon’s evidence on the
      basis of his speculation on the impact that the admission of the evidence
      would have on the ability of the respondent to fairly respond to the Crown’s
      case and, in particular, Mr.&nbsp;Rochon’s opinion of the cause of the
      fire.  </span></p>

      acquitted the respondent on the basis of reasonable doubt.  </span></p>

      appellant takes the position that the trial judge applied the wrong standard
      in imposing costs against the Crown in this criminal matter.  The appellant
      relies on <i>R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc.</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 575 to argue
      that a trial judge should decline to award costs against the Crown absent
      misconduct that includes flagrant and unjustified behaviour.  The appellant
      submits that without a finding of egregious misconduct on the Crown’s part,
      an order requiring the Crown to compensate the respondent for costs incurred
      to prepare a response to the Rochon Report, constitutes reversible error.   </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      is well-settled that superior courts possess both the inherent jurisdiction
      and authority under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter </i>to order costs against
      the Crown in the circumstances involving untimely disclosure: see <i>R.
      v. 974649 Ontario Inc.</i>, <i>supra</i>, at paragraph 80 and <i>R. v.
      Bhatti</i> (2006), 204 C.C.C. (3d) 463 at paragraph 19 (B.C.C.A.).  On
      this record, however, I am satisfied that the Crown’s conduct in this case
      did not amount to flagrant and unjustified misconduct such that an order
      for legal costs was warranted. The Supreme Court set out a conjunctive
      test in <i>974649 Ontario Inc.</i> – the Crown’s conduct with respect to
      non-disclosure must be both flagrant <i>and </i>unjustified to attract
      cost sanctions.  The trial judge in this case did not characterize the
      Crown’s failure to disclose the Rochon Report in a timely fashion as “a
      marked and unacceptable departure from the reasonable standards expected
      of the prosecution.”  The trial judge found as a fact, on originally admitting
      it, that the Rochon Report’s existence was not made known to the Crown
      until well into the trial.  His determination that his costs order was
    “in some measure tied to my finding that the police knew that Rochon Engineering
    had been retained by the building owner’s insurers and were in the process
    of preparing an analysis of the root cause [of] the fire” had absolutely
    no bearing on the Crown’s conduct, and should not have been the focus of

      although the Crown did not comply with the strict requirements of disclosing

      required to consider the relief set out under s. 657.3(4).  The most appropriate
      remedy in this case was to allow an adjournment pursuant to s. 657.3(4)(a),

      his opinion in light of the Rochon Report.  Moreover, while the trial judge

      7 and 11(d) of the <i>Charter </i>provide an accused with a constitutional
      right to make full answer and defence.  The Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R.
      v. Lyttle</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 193 emphasized the significance of an accused’s
      right to cross-examine Crown witnesses in an adversarial process at paragraphs
      41-44:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As mentioned at the outset, the right of an accused
    to cross-examine prosecution witnesses without significant and unwarranted
    constraint is an essential component of the right to make a full answer and
    defence. See <i>R. v. Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577, per McLachlin J.
    (as she then was):</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>The right of the innocent not to be convicted
    is dependent on the right to present full answer and defence.  This, in turn,
    depends on being able to call the evidence necessary to establish a defence
    and to <i>challenge the evidence called by the prosecution</i>….</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>In short, the denial of the right to call and <i>challenge
      evidence</i> is tantamount to the denial of the right to rely on a defence
      to which the law says one is entitled.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In <i>R. v. Osolin</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, Cory
    J. reviewed the relevant authorities and, at p. 663, explained why cross-examination
    plays such an important role in the adversarial process, particularly, though
    of course not exclusively, in the context of a criminal trial:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>There can be no question of the importance
    of cross-examination.  It is of essential importance in determining whether
    a witness is credible. Even with the most honest witness cross-examination
    can provide the means to explore the frailties of the testimony. For example,
    it can demonstrate a witness's weakness of sight or hearing. It can establish
    that the existing weather conditions may have limited the ability of a witness
    to observe, or that medication taken by the witness would have distorted
    vision or hearing. Its importance cannot be denied. It is the ultimate means
    of demonstrating truth and of testing veracity. Cross-examination must be
    permitted so that an accused can make full answer and defence. The opportunity
    to cross-examine witnesses is fundamental to providing a fair trial to an
    accused. This is an old and well-established principle that is closely linked
    to the presumption of innocence.  See <i>R. v. Anderson</i> (1938), 70 C.C.C.
    275 (Man. C.A.); <i>R. v. Rewniak</i> (1949), 93 C.C.C. 142 (Man. C.A.); <i>Abel
    v. The Queen</i> (1955), 115 C.C.C. 119 (Que. Q.B.); <i>R. v. Lindlau</i> (1978),
    40 C.C.C. (2d) 47 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Commensurate with its importance, the right to
    cross-examine is now recognized as being protected by ss. 7 and 11(d) of
    the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  See <i>Osolin</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at p. 665.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The right of cross-examination must therefore be
    jealously protected and broadly construed [emphasis in original].</p>

      right to cross-examine a witness, however, is not absolute or limitless.  The
      seminal authority in this area is <i>R. v. Hart</i> (1999), 135 C.C.C.
      (3d) 377 (N.S.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2000] S.C.C.A.
      No. 109.  The accused in <i>Hart</i> was convicted of sexually assaulting
      and touching for a sexual purpose two young boys.  One complainant, who
      was 12 years old at the time of trial, became unresponsive during questions
      posed in cross-examination.  Based on his unresponsiveness, the defence
      sought a judicial stay or a directed verdict of acquittal.  The trial judge
      declined to grant this relief, and this decision was upheld on appeal.  </span></p>

      for the <i>Hart </i>court, Cromwell J.A. carefully reviewed relevant English,
      American and Canadian authorities, and emphasized that where there has
      been incomplete cross-examination of a witness, there is no dispositive
      test in determining whether an accused has been deprived of the right to
      make full answer and defence or whether an accused’s trial has become unfair.  Nevertheless,
      he provided guidance for trial judges and set out three relevant considerations
      in arriving at this determination, namely (1) the reasons for the witness’ unresponsiveness,
      (2) the impact of the witness’ unresponsiveness, and (3) possible ameliorative
      action.  Cromwell J.A. described relevant matters under these three broad
      headings and cautioned that his comments with respect to each category
      were neither exhaustive nor definitive.  Ultimately, whether a case against
      an accused may proceed following an incomplete cross-examination of a witness
      falls within the trial judge’s discretion.  In the view of Cromwell&nbsp;J.A.
      this discretion should be exercised with a view to ensuring both fairness
      to the accused and the pursuit of truth.  To this I would add that the
      discretion should also be exercised with a similar view toward the Crown.  This
      will require the trial judge to consider many factors in balancing trail
      fairness from the perspective of the Crown and the accused.</span></p>

      complainant in <i>Hart.</i>  On the contrary, Mr. Young answered questions
      that were put to him in both direct examination and in cross-examination
      in an open and voluntary manner.  Instead, this case involves a situation
      where the Crown’s key expert witness was silenced during cross-examination
      due to ill health.  Though <i>Hart </i>was decided in the context of an
      unresponsive child witness, the discussion in <i>Hart</i> is instructive
      on matters of limited cross-examination of expert witnesses and is applicable
      to this appeal.   </span></p>

      issue in this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in his assessment
      of the second and third considerations outlined in Hart, <i>i.e.</i>, the
      impact of Mr. Young’s limited cross-examination on the respondent’s right
      to a fair trial and the potential ameliorative action that could have been
      taken by the trial judge.  As for the first consideration, it is common

      not have been avoided by reasonable action.  </span></p>

      appellant makes four submissions in support of its argument that the trial
      judge erred in his application of the
    “impact of limited cross-examination” and “possibilities of ameliorative
    action factors” as articulated in <i>Hart</i>, and hence, erred in the exercise
    of his discretion by excluding Mr. Young’s expert evidence in its entirety.  First,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge should have entertained testimony
    from Michael Rochon before speculating on the prejudicial impact it would
    have had on Mr. Young’s incomplete cross-examination.  In other words, the
    appellant argues that the trial judge’s exclusion of Mr.&nbsp;Young’s evidence
    was premature.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      the appellant argues that the trial judge failed to consider corroborative
      evidence adduced at trial in assessing the impact of Mr.&nbsp;Young’s limited
      cross-examination.  The appellant points out that Mr.&nbsp;Young’s evidence
      relating to the presence of gasoline accelerants, the locations of isolated
      burn spots, the movement of fire within the apartment, and salvage operations
      was confirmed by the testimony of police officers, firefighters, and neighbours.  Third,
      the appellant contends that the trial judge failed to properly consider
      the extent of Mr.&nbsp;Young’s cross-examination.  In the appellant’s view,
      Mr.&nbsp;Young’s cross-examination was not curtailed with respect to contentious
      issues such as the locations of isolated burns, the impact that his movement
      of debris and furniture would have on the scene for further testing by
      Mr.&nbsp;Rochon, and his contamination of a sample submitted to the Centre
      for Forensic Sciences.  Finally, the appellant relies on this court’s decision
      in <i>R. v. Lovie</i> (1995), 100 C.C.C. (3d) 68 (Ont. C.A.) and the Alberta
      Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>R. v. Yu</i> (2002), 171 C.C.C. (3d) 90
      (Alta. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 321
      for the proposition that in considering a potential ameliorative course
      of action, the trial judge should have considered admitting Mr.&nbsp;Young’s
      evidence, albeit with diminished weight.  A further potential ameliorative
      action, the appellant urges, would have been to grant a mistrial.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      respondent, however, submits that it was within the trial judge’s broad
      discretion to exclude Mr.&nbsp;Young’s evidence on the basis that it affected
      the fairness of the respondent’s trial, especially when coupled with the
      late disclosure of the Rochon Report.  The argument runs as follows.  Mr.&nbsp;Young’s
      evidence was intricately linked to Mr.&nbsp;Rochon’s evidence because Mr.&nbsp;Young
      had altered the scene before Rochon Engineering arrived to investigate
      the cause of the fire.  Mr.&nbsp;Young’s partial cross-examination focused
      solely on his own observations of the scene and his conclusions regarding
      the cause of the fire.  Because Mr.&nbsp;Young was not cross-examined on
      the state in which he left the apartment, his potential contamination of
      the scene was not scrutinized.  The respondent argues that without Mr.&nbsp;Young’s
      further cross-examination on this issue, there would be no way of testing
      the veracity of Mr.&nbsp;Rochon’s evidence respecting the apartment’s state
      when he first conducted his investigation.  The appropriate remedy, therefore,
      was to exclude Mr.&nbsp;Young’s entire testimony from evidence and to preclude
      the Crown from introducing the Rochon evidence.</span></p>

      addressing these issues, and before undertaking a review of Cromwell J.A.’s
      useful analysis of the impact of a witness’ limited cross-examination and
      possible ameliorative action at pp. 412-413 of <i>Hart</i>, it is important
      to note that the Hart case involved different procedural circumstances.  In <i>Hart</i>,
      the defence moved for a judicial stay or a directed verdict of acquittal
      following the close of the Crown’s case.  In other words, the trial judge
      in <i>Hart</i> was in a good position to assess the impact of the child’s
      incomplete cross-examination in the context of all evidence that had been
      adduced by the Crown.  In the instant appeal, however, the trial judge
      delivered his ruling regarding the exclusion of Mr.&nbsp;Young’s evidence <i>before</i> the
      Crown rested.  In his ruling dated June 25, 2003, the trial judge contemplated
      deferring his decision until Mr.&nbsp;Rochon’s testimony was completed,
      but declined to do so:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At first I thought it might be more advisable to
    defer a decision on the application until after I had heard the complete
    evidence of Mr. Rochon, if only to give some context to Mr. Clements’ complaints.  I
    was initially inclined to that view since the challenge now mounted speaks
    to a fight between and perhaps among experts in terms of how, where and by
    whom the fire that consumed the Cameron apartment started.  To deal with
    the impact issue or the third issue, namely the ameliorative action issue,
    in the abstract would make the task difficult if not impossible.  That being
    said, Mr. Clements did ultimately outline in more detail some of the issues
    upon which he intended to cross-examine Mr. Young, putting thereby some context
    to his argument.   </p>
  <p class=NoPara style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge

      my opinion, the trial judge should have followed his initial view and should
      not have ruled on the motion at this stage of the trial.  In <i>R. v. Bero</i> (2000),
      151 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.) the accused was charged with impaired driving
      causing bodily harm and driving “over 80.”  The accused and the primary
      Crown witness were thrown from a vehicle and seriously injured.  The only
      issue at trial was the identity of the driver.  Unknown to the Crown, the
      vehicle was sold to an auto wrecker and was destroyed days before the defence
      requested the vehicle to be retained for further forensic examination.  The
      defence sought a stay of proceedings based on the destruction of crucial
      evidence, and this motion was dismissed before the trial judge heard any
      evidence on the trial proper.  On appeal, Doherty J.A. ordered a new trial
      and aptly held that the trial judge erred in ruling on the motion at the
      outset of trial. He noted:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trial judge should not have ruled on the motion
    at the outset of the trial.  <i>This Court has repeatedly indicated that
    except where the appropriateness of a stay is manifest at the outset of proceedings,
    a trial judge should reserve on motions such as the motion brought in this
    case until after the evidence has been heard.  The trial judge can more effectively
    assess issues such as the degree of prejudice caused to an accused by the
    destruction of evidence at the end of the trial…</i>The approached favoured
    by this Court was approved in <i>R. v. La</i> (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 97
    (S.C.C.) at 107-108.  In keeping with that approach, I will consider the
    appellant’s claim that a stay should have been granted in the light of the
    evidence which was adduced at the trial [emphasis added and citations omitted]. </p>

      J.A. reiterated this rule in <i>R. v. Varga</i> (2001), 159 C.C.C. (3d)
      502 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2002] S.C.C.A. No.&nbsp;278,
      at paragraph 66.  Though the respondent’s counsel at trial did not seek
      a stay of proceedings, his motion to exclude both Mr.&nbsp;Young’s and
      Mr.&nbsp;Rochon’s evidence heard on June 5 &amp; 6, 2003 was characterized
      by the trial judge as “almost as extreme [as] a stay of proceedings.”  In
      this situation, the trial judge did not follow the preferred approach articulated
      in <i>Bero</i> and <i>Varga</i>.  He did not satisfy himself that it was
      clearly appropriate to make a ruling on the motion at that stage in the
      trial rather than to reserve on it until after all the evidence had been
      heard.  A review of submissions made on the June 5
    &amp; 6 application indicates that the appropriateness of excluding Mr.&nbsp;Young’s
    evidence before the close of the Crown’s case was not manifest or obvious.  Although
    the respondent’s counsel highlighted areas that he wished to explore if Mr.&nbsp;Young’s
    cross&#8209;examination were to continue, the trial judge would have been
    in a better position to assess the impact that Mr.&nbsp;Young’s limited cross-examination
    would have had to trial fairness after Mr.&nbsp;Rochon’s evidence had been
    heard, as well as any evidence that the respondent introduced.  It is helpful
    to recall that the respondent’s cross&#8209;examination of Mr.&nbsp;Young
    was virtually complete, except in regard to the Rochon&nbsp;Report.  As Doherty
    J.A. put it in paragraph 66 of <i>Varga</i>, a “trial judge is in a better
    position to assess prejudice at the end of evidence.”  The proper procedural
    course that the trial judge should have followed in the exercise of his discretion

      assessing the impact of a witness’
    limited cross-examination on the accused’s right to a fair trial, Cromwell
    J.A. in <i>Hart</i> underscored the need for trial judges to consider (1)

      more important the evidence to the prosecution’s case, the more reluctant
      the trial judge should be to allow it without full cross-examination and
      testing.”  The trial judge cannot be criticized in reasoning that because
      Mr.&nbsp;Young was originally the Crown’s critical expert witness on the
      cause of the fire, a court should be disinclined to allow his testimony
      without the benefit of complete cross-examination.  He also probed the

      I would agree with the appellant’s argument that in the exercise of his
      discretion the trial judge failed to consider corroborative evidence previously
      adduced in assessing the impact of Mr.&nbsp;Young’s limited cross-examination.  As
      Cromwell J.A. was careful to point out at page 412 of his reasons, the
      two central considerations that a trial judge must make under the “impact
      of limited cross-examination” heading are 1) the importance of the evidence,
      and 2) whether there is a satisfactory basis upon which the trier of fact
      can evaluate the evidence.  The record reveals numerous examples of corroborative
      evidence that could have assisted the trial judge in evaluating Mr. Young’s
      incomplete cross-examination, including evidence from neighbours, a firefighter,
      and a police officer confirming the presence of gasoline; testimony from
      two neighbours who attempted to extinguish the fire; and a firefighter’s
      testimony corroborating Mr.&nbsp;Young’s evidence regarding isolated burning
      within the respondent’s apartment.  Had the trial judge properly considered
      this additional evidence, he would have concluded that there was a satisfactory
      basis for evaluating Mr.&nbsp;Young’s evidence, rather than concluding,
      as he did, that his evidence must be evaluated “in the abstract.”  Moreover,
      in my view, in considering this issue it would also have been proper for
      the trial judge to consider the evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Rochon on the assumption
      that he would be permitted to testify, bearing in mind that the respondent
      would be able to cross&#8209;examine Mr.&nbsp;Rochon on whether his opinion
      would have been different in light of the alleged weaknesses in Mr.&nbsp;Young’s

      held that in considering the admissibility of evidence accompanied by an
      incomplete cross-examination, the issue is the weight to be given to it
      rather than its inadmissibility:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The preponderance of reported authority supports
    the conclusion that <i>viva voce</i> testimony that is unaccompanied by cross-examination
    because of the intervening death of a witness, is not rendered inadmissible.  See <i>R.
    v. Doolin </i>(1832) Jebb. C.C. 123; <i>R. v. Solomon and Thumbler</i> (1958),
    25 W.W.R. 307 at p. 320 (Man. C.A.); <i>Bank of Montreal v. Drycreek Livestock

      there exists ample authority that supports the proposition that testimony
      that is not subjected to complete and full cross-examination need not be
      rendered inadmissible in all instances.  The trial judge in this case did
      not adequately consider the possibility of affording Mr.&nbsp;Young’s testimony
      less weight, but instead, compounded the error by insisting that courts
      are loath to “pick and choose” evidence in the abstract.  With respect,
      the trial judge was simply called upon to attribute less weight to Mr.&nbsp;Young’s
      opinion in its totality.  He was not asked to selectively discount portions
      of Mr.&nbsp;Young’s direct testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      I would reject the appellant’s argument that a mistrial was an appropriate
      remedy following the June 5 &amp; 6 motion to exclude Mr.&nbsp;Young’s
      evidence.  Mistrials are more commonly ordered in a jury setting, particularly
      because it is understood that trial judges are more capable of excluding
      inadmissible evidence during factual finding deliberations.  The <i>Criminal
      Code</i> does not provide a judge with statutory authority to declare a
      mistrial, with the exception of s. 653, which confers upon a judge the
      authority to order a mistrial where a jury is unable to agree on a verdict.  </span></p>

      trial judges possess an inherent discretionary power to declare mistrials,
      this was not a situation where it would have been prejudicial for the trial
      judge to have heard Mr.&nbsp;Young’s “inadmissible” evidence.  Moreover,
      mistrials are usually ordered in the context of inadvertent statements
      made in the course of trial, which was not the case here. As the trial
      judge put it, the Crown “assiduously avoided [a mistrial] application.”  As
      such, this remedy was not fitting in the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Because
      I have concluded that the trial judge erred in prematurely deciding the
      motion to exclude Mr.&nbsp;Young’s evidence, and alternatively, in failing
      to adequately consider the appropriateness of giving less weight to his
      evidence, it is unnecessary to consider the appellant’s further submission
      that the trial judge erred in excluding Michael Rochon’s evidence.  This
      ruling was intimately related to his reasons in excluding Mr.&nbsp;Young’s
      evidence, and hence, was in error.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Even
      if the trial judge had been correct in excluding Mr.&nbsp;Young’s evidence
      in its entirety rather than in admitting it subject to the weight to be
      given to it, there was no legal basis on which to exclude Mr.&nbsp;Rochon’s
      evidence.  It was relevant and material to the cause of the fire.  Notwithstanding
      its late production, earlier in the trial the trial judge had, in my view,
      correctly ruled it admissible over the respondent’s objection that to do
      so would require its expert to re&#8209;evaluate his opinion and possibly
      to require a change in the defence strategy.  In doing so, the trial judge
      was satisfied that the respondent’s right to a fair trial would not be
      infringed in ruling that the Rochon Report and Mr.&nbsp;Rochon’s testimony
      were admissible.  While it may have been disadvantageous and unfortunate
      to the respondent that Mr.&nbsp;Rochon’s opinion of the cause of the fire
      was based on sounder methodology than Mr.&nbsp;Young’s opinion, this did
      not provide a proper reason for the exclusion of this relevant evidence
      when it became impossible to complete Mr.&nbsp;Young’s cross&#8209;examination.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
      this I would add that in the circumstances of this case it was important
      for the trial judge to consider the stage of the trial at which the issue
      arose.  As I have pointed out, Mr.&nbsp;Young, who was the Crown’s sixteenth
      witness, had virtually completed his testimony.  The respondent’s counsel
      had essentially concluded his cross&#8209;examination.  All that remained
      was to cross&#8209;examine Mr.&nbsp;Young on any matters arising from the
      Rochon Report.  Clearly, at this juncture the parties had a significant
      investment in completing this protracted trial which, in my view, provided
      an additional reason for the trial judge to defer his ruling on the respondent’s
      motion until the conclusion of the evidence.  In balancing trial fairness
      from the perspective of the Crown and the accused, it was no doubt obvious
      to the trial judge that the exclusion of the evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Young
      and Mr.&nbsp;Rochon would have an adverse impact, as it did, on the ability
      of the Crown to prove its case.  From the perspective of the accused, had
      the trial judge not excluded the evidence of Mr.&nbsp;Young and Mr.&nbsp;Rochon,
      the accused would have responded to it with the evidence of his own expert,
      to whom the trial judge had given the opportunity to reconsider his original
      opinion in light of the Rochon Report.  Moreover, in reconsidering his
      opinion the expert also had the advantage of having heard Mr.&nbsp;Young’s
      evidence.  Had the trial judge engaged in this balancing analysis, in my
      view, it should have been clear to him that proper exercise of his discretion
      required that he defer ruling on the respondent’s motion to exclude the
      testimony of Mr.&nbsp;Young and Mr.&nbsp;Rochon until the end of the trial.</span></p>

      the trial judge in the exercise of his judicial discretion, ordered that
      the evidence that had been completed was to be excluded.  Additionally,
      again in the exercise of his discretion, he ruled that the further evidence

      a detailed outline from defence counsel of the issues upon which he intended
      to cross-examine Mr. Young and the strategy of using Mr. Young’s evidence
      to undermine Mr. Rochon’s evidence, and <i>vice versa</i>.  Having observed
      the circumstances of the trial, the trial judge was well positioned to
      determine that he had sufficient context to assess the impact of Mr. Young’s
      incomplete cross-examination and make his ruling without hearing Mr. Rochon’s

      the trial with an understanding that the Crown would be relying only on
      the expert evidence of Mr. Young, thus, excluding Mr. Young’s evidence
      and allowing the Rochon evidence would still leave the Crown with only
      one expert resulting in no prejudice to the defence.  The appellant further
      submits that in ruling to exclude the expert evidence the trial judge failed
      to consider other basis in the evidence adduced at trial that could assist
      in evaluating Mr. Young’s evidence absent a full cross-examination.  For
      example, the fact that Mr. Young had been extensively cross-examined prior
      to the Crown’s motion to admit into evidence the Rochon Report, and the
      possibility that Mr. Young’s evidence could be admitted but afforded less

      obtained from the Rochon report. This conclusion arises out of the following:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

      ostensibly to reinforce the opinion evidence of Mr. Young.  This decision
      then allowed the defence to adopt a new, and very real defence strategy

      able to resume his testimony.  It was agreed that it was unlikely that

      (3d) 377 (N.S.C.A.).  Briefly stated, this analysis provides that where
      a party has been denied a full opportunity to cross-examine an adverse
      witness, the court will examine three discrete factors: (i) the reasons
      for the unresponsiveness of the witness; (ii) the impact of the inability
      to cross-examine; and (iii) the possibilities of ameliorative action.  The
      trial judge then fully considered each branch of the analysis and concluded
      that the expert evidence ought to be excluded.  In the context of the case,

      allowing the Rochon evidence.  He also considered a stay of proceedings,
      although the Crown did not argue that he consider this remedy, nor did

      evidence.  He found that given the late disclosure of the important Rochon
      evidence, coupled with the unavailability of Mr. Young, the respondent
      was prohibited from developing through Mr. Young a basis to undermine the
      Rochon conclusions.  Consequently, fairness required that both Mr. Young’s

      the fire two days prior to the attendance by Rochon Engineering.  Thus,
