    appellant was tried for attempted murder before a judge and jury.  Ajith
    Jeyanandakumar and Rajuran Rajagopal, his two co-accused, were charged with
    aggravated assault of the same victims.  The charges all arose from a gang
    attack.  Identity was the central issue at trial for all three accused.  The
    appellant was acquitted of attempted murder but convicted of the included
    offence of aggravated assault.  Rajagopal, who offered an alibi defence,
    was acquitted while Jeyanandakumar was convicted of aggravated assault. Jeyanandakumar’s
    appeal from conviction and sentence was heard together with this appeal and
    the reasons for judgment in that appeal are being released together with
    these reasons.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 16, 2002, a gang of young men wielding swords, axes and machetes attacked
    two men in a parked car.  Chanthuru Perinpanathan, the passenger and the
    apparent target of the attack, and the driver, Muraly Balasingam, both sustained
    serious injuries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perinpanathan
    testified that a man opened the passenger-side door and kicked him. Perinpanathan
    testified that he knew the appellant, and that the appellant was not the
    man who first attacked him.  Perinpanathan lost consciousness in the middle
    of the attack and could not describe how it ended. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Balasingam
    testified that the appellant was the man who first attacked Perinpanathan.  According
    to Balasingam, the appellant initially kicked Perinpanathan and then attacked
    him with a long dagger while standing outside the open passenger door.  Balasingam
    also testified that he later saw the appellant standing at the rear of the
    car yelling encouragement to the other attackers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Balasingam
    told the police officer who arrived at the scene shortly after the attack
    that he knew the men who did this and they were “brand new” members of the “Gilder
    Boys” gang.  At trial, Balasingam acknowledged that the appellant was not
    a “brand new Gilder Boy” but rather a former member of that gang. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s case rested almost entirely on Balasingam’s evidence and there was
    no forensic evidence linking the appellant to the crime. Balasingam’s credibility
    was the subject of a prolonged attack at trial.  Balasingam has a lengthy
    criminal record including offences of dishonesty.  There were numerous inconsistencies
    in his various accounts of the attack and the appellant’s involvement.  His
    evidence relating to the details of his own criminal record and past gang
    membership was far from candid and on cross-examination he was confronted
    with transcripts and court records that contradicted his sanitized account
    of his past misdeeds.  Jeyanandakumar’s uncle, Father Virgil, a Roman Catholic
    priest, testified that he heard Balasingam offer not to testify if he was
    paid a bribe.  Balasingam denied this.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown placed significant reliance on evidence of the appellant’s post-offence
    conduct. Perinpanathan and Balasingam both testified that appellant telephoned
    them the before the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perinpanathan
    testified that the appellant called him midway through the preliminary inquiry,
    after Perinpanathan had already testified that the appellant was not the
    first assailant.  According to Perinpanathan, the appellant asked him what
    else he was going to say on the stand.  The appellant also asked Perinpanathan
    why Balasingam said that he was involved and why Balasingam had “told on” the
    accused.  The appellant asked Perinpanathan to ask Balasingam not to “come
    and tell on them”.  Perinpanathan had been charged with attempted murder
    arising from an earlier incident involving a friend of the appellant and,
    according to Perinpanathan, the appellant warned that he would make Perinpanathan ’s
    case “harder” and he would put Perinpanathan  “inside” if Perinpanathan implicated
    the appellant. Perinpanathan reported the call to the authorities the next
    day. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Balasingam
    testified the appellant had called him from jail to apologize and to ask
    Balasingam not to testify against him.  According the Balasingam, the appellant
    explained that he “came for” Perinpanathan with whom he had a “beef”, not
    to attack Balasingam.  Balasingam also said that the appellant told him that
    he was “pissed off” about having been charged earlier with assault on a man
    named Mano.  There was some suggestion that Balasingam had prompted Mano
    to go to the police.  However, in cross-examination Balasingam admitted that
    the appellant said he wasn’t upset, but rather it was the appellant’s friends
    who were upset.  Balasingam was asked on cross-examination if he knew that
    the appellant had been acquitted of the Mano assault.  He said he did not
    know.  The trial judge refused to allow the appellant’s trial counsel to
    pursue this issue by confronting Balasingam with the appellant’s criminal
    record which contained no entry for the Mano assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also relied on evidence regarding a possible motive for the attack.
    Perinpanathan had been charged with assault with a weapon on the appellant
    six months before the assault.  Those charges were ultimately dropped and
    Perinpanathan entered into a peace bond.  Two days before the attack, Perinpanathan
    was charged with attempted murder in respect of a complaint by friends of
    the appellant.  After the assault the appellant allegedly told Balasingam: “[t]
    hat’s what you get for chilling with us and backing them.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span

    appellant did not testify. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was subsequently charged with attempting to obstruct justice based
    on Balasingam’s allegations about the telephone call from the jail.  In October
    2004, after the trial in the case on appeal, the appellant was acquitted
    on the attempt to obstruct justice charge after the judge heard essentially
    the same evidence from Balasingam that was adduced at the trial for attempted
    murder.  The transcript and judgment from the attempt to obstruct justice
    trial are the subject of a fresh evidence application.  The appellant argues
    that his acquittal renders inadmissible evidence of the telephone call to
    Balasingam and that a new trial on the aggravated assault must be ordered. </p>

    his jury charge?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s instructions to the jury were brief. He did not review the
    evidence at length.  The instruction occupies a little over fifty pages of
    transcript and appears to have taken just over one hour to deliver.  This
    is commendable after a fifteen-day trial involving three accused.  There
    is much to be said for a concise jury instruction that sets out the issues
    in plain and simple terms, focusing on the key points and avoiding the obscurity
    that can be the product of excessive detail and a pointless witness-by-witness
    recitation of all the evidence: see <i>R .v. Jacquard</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C.
    (3d) 1 at paras. 1 and 13 (S.C.C.), per Lamer C.J.: “[w] e must strive to
    avoid the proliferation of very lengthy charges.…I cannot emphasize enough
    that the role of a trial judge in charging the jury is to decant and simplify.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    has been frequently stated, there is no simple template that can be uniformly
    applied when instructing a jury and no simple formula by which an appellate
    court can assess the adequacy of a jury charge.  Trial judges must be given
    considerable latitude in fashioning a jury charge that is appropriate to
    the particular circumstances of the case. When challenged on appeal, the
    charge must be read as a whole, not dissected under a microscope and, as
    Cory J. commented in <i>R. v. Cooper </i>(1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 301
    (S.C.C.), appellate courts must be mindful that, “it would be difficult if
    not impossible to find a perfect charge”. </p>

line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jurisprudence mandates a functional approach whereby the jury instruction
    is assessed pragmatically with a view to determining whether,
    “at the end of the day…[the] appellate court is satisfied that the jurors
    would adequately understand the issues involved, the law relating to the
    charge the accused is facing, and the evidence they should consider in resolving
    the issues”: <i>Cooper</i>, <i>supra</i> at 301.  In <i>R. v. MacKinnon</i> (1999),
    132 C.C.C. (3d) 545 at para. 27 (Ont. C.A.), Doherty J.A. provided the following
    helpful description of the fundamental elements to be considered when applying

    appellant submits that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury failed
    to provide adequate guidance as to the appellant’s position and the evidence
    relevant to that position.  Specifically, the appellant alleges that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='
text-align:left'>(i) the trial judge failed to explain the “second pillar” of
    the defence, namely, that Perinpanathan’s evidence exculpated the appellant; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    was a possible motive without also charging the jury that the same evidence
      suggested the appellant had no motive to commit the offence;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(iii) the trial
    judge erred by failing to instruct the jury as to a possible innocent explanation

line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence at trial rested on two propositions.  The first was what trial counsel
    labelled as the “negative” proposition that Balasingam was not a credible
    witness and that his identification of the appellant as Perinpanathan’s attacker
    should not be believed.  The second was the “positive”
    proposition that Perinpanathan’s evidence positively excluded the appellant
    as the first attacker. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s entire outline of the appellant’s position consisted of the
    following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[The appellant’s
    trial counsel], on behalf of her client, suggests to you in the strongest
    terms, that Mr. Balasingam is just not capable of belief.  He’s totally incredible.
    He’s totally unreliable because of the circumstances of his record, including
    the obstruct justice, because of Father Virgil about this attempt to corrupt
    the trial by seeking money to forget his evidence, and because of the numerous
    inconsistencies during the progression of this investigation and prosecution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by mentioning only Balasingam’s
    lack of credibility and failing to make any reference to the significance
    of Perinpanathan’s exculpatory evidence.  Trial counsel objected to this
    omission, but the trial judge refused to recharge on the issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the problem was compounded by the fact that, apart
    from Rajagopal’s alibi, the trial judge more or less equated the appellant’s
    position with that of the other two accused. The appellant says that his
    position differed significantly as Perinpanathan’s evidence was positive
    evidence of his innocence, a point not available to his co-accused.  The
    appellant argues that by leaving the jury with the impression that all three
    co-accused took the same position, the trial judge obscured and minimized
    the significance of Perinpanathan’s exculpatory evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    adequate explanation of the positions of the parties is routinely cited as
    one of the essential elements of a proper jury charge: <i>MacKinnon</i>, <i>supra</i>.
    The statement of Taschereau&nbsp;J. in <i>Azoulay v. The Queen,</i> [1952]
    S.C.R. 495 at 497-498 has been frequently cited on this point:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[t]he rule which
    has been laid down, and consistently followed is that in a jury trial the
    presiding judge must, except in rare cases where it would be needless to
    do so, review the substantial parts of the evidence, and give the jury the
    theory of the defence, so that they may appreciate the value and effect of
    that evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they find
    them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perinpanathan’s
    evidence that he knew the appellant and that the appellant was not the man
    who first attacked him was inconsistent with Balasingam’s evidence that the
    appellant was Perinpanathan’s initial attacker. In my view, Perinpanathan’s
    evidence was central to appellant’s defence and the position of the appellant
    could not fairly be stated without some mention of it.  The trial judge should
    have referred to it when outlining the appellant’s position to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent points out that the trial judge did not ignore Perinpanathan’s
    evidence that the appellant was not the first attacker.  When instructing
    the jury with respect to Balasingam’s eyewitness identification of the appellant
    as Perinpanathan’s attacker, the trial judge stated: “Now, another thing
    that impacts upon his identification is the fact that Mr. Perinpanathan has
    said that that was not Mr. Mahalingan who came in – who was the first to
    come in and the wave of individuals who went after him”.  That, however,
    is the only reference to Perinpanathan’s exculpatory evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s brief reference to Perinpanathan’s evidence in connection with
    his standard caution as to eyewitness identification evidence was, in my
    view, insufficient to bring home to the jury the essence of the appellant’s
    defence.  The appellant’s position was not that Balasingam’s evidence should
    be rejected because of the frailties associated with eyewitness identification
    evidence.  The appellant’s position was that Balasingam was a liar and that
    Perinpanathan’s evidence positively exculpated the appellant as the perpetrator
    of this attack.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury had, of course, heard the appellant’s trial counsel’s closing address,
    in which she stressed the importance of Perinpanathan’s evidence.  However,
    counsels’ closing addresses do not absolve the trial judge of the duty to
    present the jury with a fair and dispassionate summary of the positions of
    the parties, especially where the position of the Crown is set out but that
    of the accused is not.  The failure to mention the second pillar of the defence,
    when combined with the trial judge’s instruction to the jury that the appellant’s
    position was the same as that of his co-accused, had the effect of at best
    ignoring, and at worst undercutting a significant element of the appellant’s

    review of Perinpanathan’s evidence.  The task of ensuring that the jury understood
    the appellant’s position and the evidence relevant to that position could
    have been accomplished with the same admirable economy demonstrated by the

    the evidence of gang rivalry provided a motive, while the appellant argued

    he then stated that evidence of gang membership “had been advanced for the
    limited purpose of potentially explaining why this attack took place and
    why Mr. Balasingam and Mr. Perinpanathan were targets”. The appellant complains

    consistent with the appellant’s innocence, namely that the call was motivated
    by stress, panic and confusion.  Perinpanathan had already given evidence

    agree with the respondent that as the appellant did not testify, it is difficult
    to fault the trial judge for simply giving the standard instruction without
    trying to find an innocent explanation for the call.  The explanation that
    the appellant says the trial judge should have given is speculative and hardly
    compelling.  Perinpanathan had not completed his evidence, and the appellant
    could have been worried about what else Perinpanathan might say, not to mention
    the fact that Perinpanathan testified that the appellant also sought information
    on Balasingam and urged Perinpanathan to convince Balasingam not to testify

    phone call between the appellant and Balasingam into evidence.  The contested
    statement allegedly made by the appellant is that he was “pissed off” at
    Balasingam because, on an earlier occasion, Balasingam had encouraged a man
    named Mano to go to the police, causing the appellant to be charged with
    assault.  The trial judge held that this statement was potentially relevant
    to the appellant’s motive and therefore refused to exclude this aspect of
    Balasingam’s evidence as to the phone call.   </p>

    by using the appellant’s record to show the acquittal.  The trial judge ruled

    bad feelings towards him and, submits the appellant, the statement therefore
    could have no probative value in respect of the motive.  In addition, any
    probative value was outweighed by the prejudice the statement would cause.  The
    appellant also submits that a stronger limiting instruction should have been

    was open to the trial judge to conclude as he did that the Mano evidence
    was “possibly an explanation of why this attack took place either corporately
    or individually and accordingly it relates to motive”.  The trial judge’s

    acquittal would not affect the motive theory as the appellant was charged
    as a result of Balasingam’s actions and that, in itself, could provide a
    possible motive for the attack.  Second, even if the appellant were entitled

    not make this order in the absence of a factual background.  He had heard
    several pre-trial motions and was apprised of the general circumstances of
    the offences.  He would have known that the case involved a very serious
    attack, that there were allegations of gang affiliation as well as allegations
    of witness tampering.  In my view, this provided a sufficient record for
    concluding that it was “in the best interest of the administration of justice” to
    make the order with a view to protecting the privacy or safety of the jurors.  While
    there was some risk of prejudice, it was open to the trial judge to conclude
    that the risk of harm to the integrity of the trial process and jury safety

    J. qualified the application of issue estoppel to limit the use of similar
    fact evidence on the basis that “in certain circumstances, the fact of an
    accused’s prior acquittal may have relevance to an ultimate issue in a subsequent
    trial”.  The first example was the case of <i>R. v. Ollis</i>, [1900] 2 Q.B.
    758 where the accused was charged with false pretences on the basis of obtaining
    goods in exchange for a cheque that was later dishonoured.  His defence was
    that he lacked <i>mens rea</i> as he expected to receive funds to cover the
    cheque.  Evidence was led of a similar incident in which he had raised the
    same defence and been acquitted.  Evidence of the prior incident was admissible
    despite the acquittal as, even if the accused was innocent of the first charge,
    the very fact that he had been charged went to his knowledge of wrongdoing
    and undermined his explanation for the second offence. Cory J. clearly regarded
    this as an exception to the rule: “[y]et, in most situations, it will be
    unfair and inappropriate to admit the evidence underlying the prior acquittal
    as similar fact evidence in a subsequent trial of the same accused”.  I do
    not see how the circumstances of the present case can be brought within the <i>Ollis</i> exception. </p>

    second circumstance described by Cory J. (at para. 79) where the <i>Grdic</i> principle
    does not apply is that of multiple count indictments: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I cannot accept
    the proposition that the principle set out in <i>Grdic, supra</i>, applies
    to verdicts rendered by the same trier of fact in respect of charges tried
    together in a single proceeding. There is nothing unfair or logically irreconcilable
    about a jury having reasonable doubt whether the accused committed an act
    while also finding that it is likely that he committed it. There may very
    well be good reasons to exclude similar fact evidence underlying a prior
    acquittal in a subsequent proceeding. However, the principle has no application
    where the alleged similar acts are the subject of a multi-count indictment.</p>

    agree with Blair J.A. and with Lee Steusser, “Admitting Acquittals as Similar
    Fact Evidence” (2002), 45 Crim. L.Q. 488 at 497 that the principle that there
    is “nothing unfair or logically irreconcilable about a jury having reasonable
    doubt whether the accused committed an act while also finding that it is
    likely that he committed it” could equally be applied to acquittals in prior
    or subsequent trials.  I do not agree, however, that <i>Arp</i> goes that
    far. The similar fact decisions of this court and other provincial appellate
    courts applying the <i>Grdic</i> principle to acquittals in prior or subsequent
    trials were cited in <i>Arp</i>, yet Cory J. carved out a specific exception
    applicable to multiple count indictments. </p>

    would add, however, that I do agree with my colleague and with the respondent
    that it may well be appropriate to reconsider the application of issue estoppel
    in this area.  In <i>R. v. Z.,</i> [2000] 3 All E.R. 385 (H.L.), the House
    of Lords rejected the issue estoppel doctrine as it has evolved in Canada
    in favour of a more limited form of double jeopardy protection.  The appellant
    was charged with rape and the prosecution adduced as similar fact evidence
    four incidents of prior sexual misconduct.  The accused had been charged
    and acquitted in relation to three of the four incidents.  The House of Lords
    held that as leading similar fact evidence did not put the accused in jeopardy
    of conviction for the similar fact conduct, the Crown was allowed to introduce
    the evidence despite the prior acquittals. <i>R. v. Z.</i> was followed by
    the New Zealand Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Degnan,</i> [2001] 1 N.Z.L.R.
    280 at para. 34 (C.A.) where the decisions of this court, including <i>G.(K.R.),

    exclusion of similar fact evidence on the basis of issue estoppel has been
    the subject of trenchant criticism by academic and other authors: see Steusser, <i>supra</i>;

    C.C.C. (3d) 407 (Que. C.A.), the Quebec Court of Appeal held that on the
    particular facts of the case, evidence underlying an acquittal could be admitted
    along the lines of the <i>Ollis </i>exception, discussed in <i>Arp</i>, <i>supra</i>,

    do not accept the respondent’s submission that we should parse the acquittal
    and strip it down so as to exclude only that aspect of the evidence embraced
    by the essential elements of the offence as alleged in the indictment.  This
    would preserve the admissibility of evidence of all aspects of the call between
    the appellant and Balasingam, including the appellant’s admission, except
    for the actual attempt to obstruct justice.  This, it seems to me, would
    be unduly artificial and contrary to <i>Grant, supra</i> at 278, where the
    Supreme Court looked not just at the acquittal but considered the trial judge’s
    reasons.  Balasingam’s version of the call was of one single transaction
    in which the appellant’s alleged admission was but one aspect.  The trial
    judge’s reasons for acquittal indicate that he had a reasonable doubt that
    the call was ever made.  It follows that the entire call must be excluded.</p>

    do I accept the respondent’s submission that, in the face of the authorities
    to which I have already referred, I should refuse to allow issue estoppel
    to reach back to retrospectively render inadmissible the phone call evidence
    on the basis of <i>R. v. Hewson</i> (1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 507 (S.C.C.).  <i>Hewson</i> did
    not deal with issue estoppel. It held that where a prior conviction was otherwise
    admissible, the mere fact that an appeal against that conviction was pending
    did not render it inadmissible.  By the time the case reached the Supreme
    Court, the appeal against the prior conviction had been allowed and a new
    trial ordered.  However, the effect of the appeal being allowed appears not
    to have been considered. Ritchie J., for the majority, dealt with the point
    (at 516) “on the sole ground that a notice of appeal had been entered against” the
    conviction.  In <i>R. v. Duong</i> (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 392 at paras.
    48-50 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Duong</i> (2001), 160 C.C.C. (3d) 467 (Ont. C.A.),
    this court considered the effect of <i>Hewson</i> in a case involving the
    admission at trial of evidence of a prior conviction as an element of the
    offence. The prior conviction was successfully appealed. <i>R. v. G. (K.R.),
    supra</i>, was applied and the reversal of the conviction was given the retrospective
    effect of rendering the prior conviction inadmissible.</p>

    touched you in any way.  So why would you go to court for me?”  He insisted
    he had come for Mr. Perinpanathan, the other victim, and not for Balasingam,

    the fact that the appellant was “pissed off” with Balasingam because Balasingam
    had encouraged a Mr. Mano to have the police lay an earlier assault charge

line-height:normal'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Sharpe J.A. notes, the appellant’s argument is premised on the principle – enunciated
    in <i>Grdic v. The Queen </i>(1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.) and in <i>R.
    v. Grant</i> (1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 268 (S.C.C.) –
    that an acquittal is equivalent to a finding of innocence, thus precluding
    the Crown on estoppel grounds from relying, in subsequent criminal proceedings,
    on facts essentially determined in favour of the accused in the first proceedings.  <i>Grdic</i> involved
    an attempt by the Crown to use the facts underlying an acquittal in a subsequent
    proceeding, however.  It did not deal with an attempt to employ the issue
    estoppel principle retrospectively, and there was of course no analysis of
    whether it would make sense to do so.  In my view, therefore, <i>Grdic</i> does
    not stand for the proposition that issue estoppel may be applied <u>retrospectively</u> to
    undermine the legitimacy of an <u>earlier</u> conviction otherwise rightly
    entered on evidence properly before the earlier tribunal at the time.  <i>Grdic</i> speaks
    to the question of issue estoppel <u>prospectively</u>.  As Lamer J. said
    at 293-294, adopting the words of Professor Friedland in his text, <i>Double
    Jeopardy,</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As a matter

line-height:normal'>[80]<span

    is in that context that Lamer J’s later remark in <i>Grdic</i> to the effect
    that the Crown is estopped (in such proceedings) from re-litigating “any
    issue, the resolution of which had to be in favour of the accused as a prerequisite
    to the acquittal, is irrevocably deemed to have been found conclusively in
    favour of the accused”, must be read.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    the retrospective application of issue estoppel in the circumstances of this
    case at least, is meaningless.  It is meaningless because it does not respond
    to any of the basic principles that underpin the notion of issue estoppel,
    namely:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    the opposite, by fostering yet another proceeding);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    should not be required to defend himself or herself continuously against
    the same allegations, once the legal system has determined the issue in his
    or her favour (that is not the case here); and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>c)      to guard against inconsistent verdicts (again, not a concern here,
    as attempting to obstruct justice was not an issue at the attempt murder/aggravated
    assault trial, and the two different triers of fact were operating on the
    basis of a different standard of proof)</p>

    I do not view <i>Grdic</i> as precluding us from dismissing this ground of
    appeal.  Indeed, it seems to me that the Supreme Court’s more recent decision
    in <i>R. v. Arp</i> (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) suggests the contrary.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Arp</i> involved
    a multiple count indictment for two murders.  The trial judge concluded there
    were significant and striking similarities between the two murders and instructed
    the jurors that, if they were satisfied the two offences were likely committed
    by the same person, they could consider the evidence on each count in determining
    whether the accused committed the offences charged on both counts.  The appellant
    in that case argued that the jurors were only entitled to use the similar
    facts underlying one count in considering guilt on both counts if they were
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the underlying similar facts would
    give rise to a verdict of guilty on the first count.  In other words, the <i>Grdic</i> principle
    of issue estoppel applied to prevent the Crown from relying on the similar
    facts if the jury would acquit on one or both of the counts after considering
    the underlying similar facts in isolation.  </p>

    on behalf of a unanimous court, Justice Cory rejected this argument.  Although
    recognizing the importance of the <i>Grdic</i> principle in our system of
    justice, Cory J. refused to employ the criminal concept of issue estoppel,
    hitherto applied in a prospective sense (i.e., in subsequent Crown proceedings)
    in a situation involving simultaneous criminal proceedings (i.e., in a multiple-count
    indictment).  He did so on the basis (para. 79) that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is nothing
    unfair or logically irreconcilable about a jury having reasonable doubt whether
    the accused committed an act while also finding that it is likely he committed

    my view, this same approach is equally appropriate in the presence circumstances,
    in which the appellant attempts to invoke issue estoppel in a way that is
    even one step more removed from that contemplated in <i>Grdic.</i>  In the
    subsequent criminal trial on the attempt to obstruct justice charge, Marchand
    J. found that he had a reasonable doubt as to whether the Crown had established
    the factual basis to support a finding of guilt.  However, as Cory J. observed, “[t]here
    is nothing unfair or logically irreconcilable about” the jurors in the case
    under appeal having found that the appellant had likely made the phone call
    in question and the remarks attributed to him in it, and in their having
    used that balance-of-probability finding as part of their consideration in
    concluding that the appellant was guilty of aggravated assault.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is true that the statement of Cory J. was made in the context of a multiple
    count indictment and in that sense was intended to apply to such a circumstance,
    as Sharpe J.A. notes.  Respectfully, however, I do not view Justice Cory’s
    analysis in the limiting fashion that my colleague does.  Indeed, as I have
    said, it follows from Cory J’s analysis, in my opinion, that the same approach
    to the application of issue estoppel would apply in a retrospective context,
    i.e., where we have gone from a prospective situation (use in a subsequent
    proceeding) to a simultaneous situation (a multiple count indictment) to
    a retrospective situation (a prior trier having already made findings on
    the basis of a different standard of proof in relation to a different issue – attempted
    murder/aggravated assault as opposed to an attempt obstruct justice).   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Theoretically,
    there would have been nothing to prevent the Crown from proceeding against
    the appellant on the attempt to obstruct justice charge, in a multi-count
    indictment, at the same time as it proceeded with the attempt murder and
    aggravated assault charges.  <i>Arp</i> would apply directly in such circumstances
    to permit the admission of the facts relating to the telephone call.  That
    the appellant may have been acquitted of attempting to obstruct justice while
    at the same time convicted of aggravated assault, on the basis of the same
    evidence, would have been of no moment.  Why should it be different if the
    conviction for aggravated assault preceded the acquittal for attempting to
    obstruct justice?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exactly
    the same rationale applies:  “There is nothing unfair or logically irreconcilable
    about a [trier] having reasonable doubt [in the subsequent proceeding] whether
    the accused committed an act (the attempt to obstruct justice) while [another
    trier in a previous proceeding has also found] that it is likely he committed
    it.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    none of the principles that underlie the rationale for issue estoppel – as
    outlined in para. 81 above – apply.  The same issue was not before the two
    triers.  There is no exposure to double jeopardy.  The jury in this case
    appropriately weighed the evidence that was properly before it, and found
    Mr. Mahalingan guilty of aggravated assault.  In doing so they had only to
    be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the phone call took place
    and that the appellant said what was attributed to him.  To convict on the
    subsequent obstruct justice charge, Justice Marchand had to be satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the charge had been made out.  As he said,
    he was not.<a

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    I do not wish to detract altogether from the importance of issue estoppel
    in our system of criminal jurisprudence, to set aside an otherwise proper
    jury verdict on the basis that the appellant was subsequently acquitted of
    a charge that is unrelated to the purposes for which the phone call evidence
    was tendered in this case, would in my opinion bring the administration of
    justice into disrepute.  I do not accept that <i>Grdic</i> compels us to
    do so.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Sharpe J.A. also observes, however, this court has applied the <i>Grdic</i> principle
    to preclude the admission of evidence underlying an acquittal as similar
    fact evidence.  It has done so even in cases where the acquittal follows
    the trial at which the similar fact evidence was led – in effect applying
    issue estoppel retrospectively in the similar fact context:  see <i>R. v.
    G. (K.R.)</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 268 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Verney</i> (1993),
    87 C.C.C. (3d) 363 (Ont. C.A.); and, <i>R. v. Rulli</i> (1999), 134 C.C.C.
    (3d) 465 (Ont. C.A.), application for leave to appeal dismissed, [1999] S.C.C.A.
    No. 284.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    the exception of <i>Rulli</i>, however, these cases were decided before the
    decision of Cory J. in <i>Arp</i>.  They should be viewed now in light of
    that decision.  While <i>Rulli</i> was subsequent to <i>Arp,</i> it purported
    to follow <i>G. (K.R.)</i> and <i>Verney</i>, and made no reference to <i>Arp</i> on
    this point.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I am not persuaded that we are precluded by the doctrine of <i>stare decisis</i> from
    rejecting the appellant’s submission that his subsequent acquittal on the
    charge of attempting to obstruct justice renders the evidence of the phone
    call between him and Mr. Balasingam retrospectively inadmissible, thereby
    undermining the validity of his earlier conviction on the unrelated charge
    of aggravated assault.  For the reasons outlined above, as well as those
    alluded to in paragraphs 61-62 of the reasons of Sharpe J.A., I reject that
    argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances the test set out in <i>Palmer and Palmer v. R.</i> (1979),
    50 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (S.C.C.) for the admission of fresh evidence has not been
    met since the evidence of the acquittal, even if admitted, would not bear
    upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at trial nor could it have
    been expected to have affected the result at trial since, in my view, it
    would not have the effect of rendering the Balasingam telephone evidence
    inadmissible.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    I agree in the result with Sharpe J.A. that the appellant’s conviction must
    be set aside and a new trial ordered on the ground that the trial judge erred
    in failing to outline the position of the defence adequately in his charge
    to the jury.  I also agree that the trial judge did not err in admitting
    the statement attributed to the appellant admitting prior misconduct, but
    excluding evidence capable of dispelling the prejudice arising from the statement.  And
    I agree that the trial judge did not err in ordering that potential jurors
    be identified by number only and not by name.</p>

    I respectfully disagree with the conclusion that the appellant’s subsequent
    acquittal for attempting to obstruct justice should be admitted as fresh
    evidence and, when admitted, used to render retrospectively inadmissible
    the evidence of the telephone call between the appellant and Mr. Balasingam.  I
    would not give effect to this latter ground of appeal.</p>
